<P>each holding one <I>hathes</I> measure, and as he presented them to the deceased, the Kher heb said:--</P>
<P>"Thou hast taken possession of that which hath flowed forth from the Eyes of Horus, and when they (i.e., the wines) are in front of thee they illumine thy face."</P>
<P>The white and the black wine were not intended to be drunk, but to be poured over the head and forehead of the deceased, so that the strength in them might be transmitted to his face. The wines, being regarded as emanations from the Eyes of Horus, the White and the Black, contained the divine power which existed in the Eyes of the god, and they transferred to the deceased the might of the Day and the Night.</P>
