<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> On September 15, 1991, between 20:30 and 20:45 Greenwich 
  Mean Time, the TV camera located at the back of Space Shuttle Discovery's cargo 
  bay was trained on the Earth's horizon while the astronauts were occupied with 
  other tasks. A glowing object suddenly appeared just below the horizon and "slowly" 
  moved from right to left and slightly upward in the picture. Several other glowing 
  objects had been visible before this, and had been moving in various directions. 
  Then a flash of light occurred at what seemed to be the lower left of the screen; 
  and the main object, along with the others, changed direction and accelerated 
  away sharply, as if in response to the flash. Shortly thereafter a streak of 
  light moved through the region vacated by the main object, and then another 
  streak moved through the right of the screen, where two of the other objects 
  had been. Roughly 65 seconds after the main flash, the TV camera rotated down, 
  showing a fuzzy picture of the side of the cargo bay. It then refocused, turned 
  toward the front of the cargo bay, and stopped broadcasting. </font>

  <font color="#FFFFFF">One of the most spectacular video footages of a UFO encounter 
  was taken by cameras on board the Discovery space shuttle on 15 September, 1991. 
  The video sequence was picked up live by a number of amateurs who were directly 
  monitoring the transmissions. The material has been shown in news broadcasts 
  and circulated amongst UFO researchers worldwide. </font>

  <font color="#FFFFFF">The video shows several small bright objects manoeuvering 
  on screen, apparently interacting with one another in a complex fashion. Sceptics 
  have usually insisted these are merely shots of some of the many small ice particles 
  which inevitably end up in orbit with every space shuttle. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> UFO investigators were quick to dispute this interpretation, 
  and US scientist Richard C. Hoagland soon conclusively demonstrated the objects 
  were actually large-sized and many hundreds of kilometres away from the shuttle. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> One UFO in particular appears to rise up from below 
  the Earth's dawn horizon and can be clearly seen emerging from behind the atmosphere 
  and the 'airglow' layers. It is certainly in orbit around the Earth, some distance 
  out in space, and travelling quickly. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> A sudden, bright flash of light is then seen to the 
  left of the picture, below the shuttle. The UFO then turns at a sharp angle 
  and heads out into space at very high speed. Two thin beams of light (or possibly 
  condensation trails) move rapidly up from the Earth's surface towards where 
  the UFO would have been if it had continued in its original orbit. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Subsequently, careful analysis of the video shows that: 
  </font>
<P> 
<UL>
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> The distance from the Discovery to the Earth's horizon 
    is 2,757 kilometres </font>
    <P> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> The UFO's speed before accelerating into space is 
    87,000 kph (Mach 73) </font>
    <P> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> Three seconds after the light flash, the UFO changes 
    direction sharply and accelarates off into space at 340,000 kph (Mach 285) 
    within 2.2 seconds </font>
    <P> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> Such an acceleration would produce 14,000 g of force 
    (1g is normal Earth gravity) </font>
</UL>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The light flash and light beams (or contrails) that 
  shoot into space have variously been described as a ground-based attempt to 
  disrupt or destroy the UFO. Hoagland interprets the incident captured by the 
  Discovery's videocamera more specifically as a "Star Wars" weapons test against 
  a Star Wars drone (the UFO). Other UFO investigators prefer to describe it as 
  a Star Wars attempt against an extraterrestrial UFO. Whichever version you prefer, 
  the technology implied is most certainly impressive - at least of Star Wars 
  calibre. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> More recently, from New Zealand, investigators have 
  reviewed the video and corrected the actual time it was taken. They have found 
  that the UFO incident was recorded over Australia and not the Philippine islands 
  as was originally thought. Discovery's trajectory had already taken it across 
  Surabaya in Java and above the Simpson Desert, Western Australia. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The UFO is first picked up coming over the horizon when 
  the shuttle is close to Lake Carnegie, WA. Later, the light flash and one contrail 
  can be tracked back to Exmouth Bay near the North West Cape military facility. 
  A second contrail can be tracked back to the Pine Gap military facility in central 
  Australia. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> US investigators have been asking their Australian counterparts 
  to provide further information which they don't have and which they probably 
  can't get. All the information we have on this incident so far comes from the 
  US or New Zealand. And, of course, there are Australia's stringent secrecy laws 
  to contend with. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The scenario was probably captured on video purely by 
  chance. Along with other UFO incidents recorded on video by NASA, this material 
  has contributed significantly towards NASA's recent decision to discontinue 
  live television transmissions from space. </font>
