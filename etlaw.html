  <font color="#FFFFFF">On 16 July 1969, a United States law was passed called 
  the "Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law" that made it illegal for the public to 
  come in contact with extra-terrestrials or their vehicles. (Title 14, Section 
  1211 of the Code of Federal Regulations). Anyone found guilty of such contact 
  could face up to one year imprisonment as well as a fine of $5000. Also, any 
  individual who had been "exposed" could be quarantined under armed guard by 
  the NASA administrator without a hearing. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The law was passed originally to protect Earth from 
  possible biological contamination resulting from the US Apollo Space Program 
  and other space exploration programs. It has been suggested by researchers and 
  scientists that the U.S. government was very concerned that contact with extra-terrestrial 
  bacteria could result in a worldwide plague. The immune system of human beings 
  wouldn't be able to fight off extra-terrestrial bacteria, so therefore any kind 
  of "extra-terrestrial exposure" was taken very seriously. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> People in the UFO community especially were alarmed 
  with the law because its broad definitions could allow the US government to 
  prosecute people in NASA as well as individuals of the general public who come 
  into contact with extra-terrestrials and their vehicles. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> UFO and ET believers found it interesting that in one 
  hand the government was denying they had any interest in extra-terrestrials, 
  yet they had a law which forbid contact with ETs and their craft. </font>
