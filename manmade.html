  <font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sure that you have read about a scientist named Nikola 
  Tesla. It was his work in science that had brought about modern day UFOs. He 
  and Viktor Schauberger were the superstars of this new flying disc technology. 
  In WWll, the Nazi's had relied heavily on Tesla's research to create what bomber 
  pilots called "Foo Fighters," or "Kraut Balls." When trying to bomb the Rhine 
  land, these glowing objects would fly right up to the bombers at incredible 
  speeds never seen before or imagined. These Foo Fighters had an ability to screw 
  up their radar so that the American pilots would have to call off the mission. 
  After they were out of the area, the "balls of coloured lights" would suddenly 
  take off on their merry way. This is all well documented and there are even 
  some photos that exist today. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The following is from an article called UFO's Alien 
  or Man Made written by Al Pinto. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Maybe these craft are some secret government project. 
  There is a lot of evidence indicating this which dates back to WWII. There is 
  a report by Marshall Yarrow, then the Reuters special correspondent to Supreme 
  H.Q. in liberated Paris. This article was published in the South Wales Argus 
  on December 13, 1944. It stated, </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"The Germans have produced a 'secret' weapon in keeping 
  with the Christmas season. The new device, which is apparently an air defence 
  weapon, and resembles the glass balls that adorn Christmas trees. They have 
  been seen hanging in the air over German territory,sometimes singly, sometimes 
  in clusters. They are coloured silver and are apparently transparent." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another article regarding the German's secret craft 
  was released by the Associated Press in the New York Herald Tribune dated January 
  2, 1945. It said: </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"Now, it seems, the Nazis have thrown something new 
  into the night skies over Germany. It is the weird, mysterious 'Foo Fighter' 
  balls which race alongside the wings of fighters flying intruder missions over 
  Germany. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Pilots have been encountering this eerie weapon for 
  more than a month in their night flights. No one apparently knows what this 
  sky weapon is. The balls of fire appear suddenly and accompany the planes for 
  miles. They seem to be radio controlled from the ground, so official intelligence 
  reports reveal..." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So why didn't the Nazi's win the war with the new Foo 
  Fighter technology? Well just like the German V-2 Rockets and the new Nazi jets, 
  time had run out. The allies were moving in and the war was being end. Hitler 
  pleaded with the German people to hang on for just two more months so that he 
  release a new technology of "super weapons." Well as you know, time did in fact 
  run out. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> When the allies moved in they began to plunder all the 
  new super technology. America began to be the benefactors of this new technology 
  when the war ended in 1945. Two years later in 1947, Kenneth Arnold a pilot 
  sees high speed flying discs. He said they moved like a saucer skipping on water 
  thus the age of "Flying Saucers" was born. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> One scientist responsible for the the Nazi flying saucers 
  was Viktor Schauberger. With Tesla's work in hand he began to create new and 
  different designs. After the Soviets had taken what the Americans had left behind 
  in Schauberger's apartment in Leonstein, the Soviets then bombed his apartment. 
  After this there was a rumour that Schauberger had gone on to work on a top 
  secret project for the U.S. Government in Texas. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In the early Fifties science was suddenly geared into 
  "anti-gravity" research. Many experiments with flying discs were taking place. 
  Some results were being talked about in science magazines and news papers. Then 
  suddenly in the late 50's the hammer of silence fell. All grant money was being 
  cut off and the media instantly became mute on the subject of this new technology 
  that now had to go underground. It even got to a point where a large number 
  of scientists were falling victim to strange accidents. Schauberger himself 
  had died of ill health. On his deathbed he declared that, "They took everything 
  from me. Everything. I don't even own myself."When flying saucers had been photographed 
  during flaps, upon seeing them, Schauberger had made it clear that someone out 
  there was using his designs. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In 1947 when Kenneth Arnold spotted the UFOs, the air 
  force was placed on red alert and quickly dispatched. The reason given was that 
  the American government thought it was a new attack by the Nazis and their Foo 
  Fighters. Photographs and blueprints of Nazi discs now started to appear. In 
  one photo, the German cross can be clearly seen. In another you can see a German 
  tank cannon attached to the underside of the craft. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Before the hammer of media silence fell, A Canadian 
  news paper, the Toronto Star, (Feb 11th 1953) began to report on the new technology 
  being produced by Avro a Canadian company. The paper had revealed that Avro 
  was working on a "Flying Saucer" that could "climb straight up in the air." 
  (This is not to be confused with the Avro Car which was shaped liked a flying 
  saucer." The source of information for this eye opening article was C.D. Howe 
  Minister of defence production. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> By April 21st 1953. The Toronto Star had stated that 
  Field Marshall Montgomery had witnessed a demonstration of the new Avro Flying 
  Saucer and declared the demonstration as being "fantastic." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Again on November 1st 1955, the Star had another article 
  that had stated, "A mock-up of the Canadian flying saucer. The highly secret 
  aircraft in whose existence few believe, was yesterday shown to a group of American 
  experts, including military officers and scientists." Why were the Americans 
  there? According to the papers, the Canadian government was planning to form 
  entire squadrons of flying saucers for the defence of Alaska. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So why hasn't the government made known this new revolutionary 
  technology. Why, is because one of the other effects that the anti-gravity devices 
  produce is massive amounts of electricity, hundreds of thousands of volts! This 
  is known as "free energy." This kind of electricity is broadcasted out and so 
  does not need wires of any kind. This is why quite often when "UFOs" are seen 
  in an area, all the appliances in a household magically come on. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The world is run by a few super rich people that have 
  untold wealth. At the very heart of this wealth is oil, "black gold." If free 
  energy technology was to be used by the public, these rich elites would stand 
  to loose trillions of dollars in lost revenue. Over night the technology of 
  jets, planes, cars, trains, manufacturing, and space flight would become obsolete. 
  NASA's pork space projects would come to an end. The Military Industrial Complex 
  would take massive revenue losses. The lost revenue from NASA, the defence companies, 
  and the entire Military Industrial Complex, oil and gas companies, and electric 
  companies would dry up considerably. In other words, free energy would kill 
  the golden goose. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Imagine this. For pennies man could fly to the moon 
  in flying discs. Tax payers would no longer foot the bill for huge expenses, 
  kick backs and over-pricing in NASA and the military. No longer would the public 
  be fleeced by the Military Industrial Complex to the tune of hundreds of billions 
  of dollars. International bankers too have a major share of this cash cow and 
  would stand to loose massive amounts of money, never mind the auto industries. 
  People could run their cars, heat their homes, and travel very cheaply. Paying 
  for energy would almost be a thing of the past. Lightning produces hundreds 
  of millions of volts of electricity from the air itself and has no need of dams, 
  cable, ground stations, electric companies, etc. The crux of this international 
  plot is too keep us convinced that energy comes from fossil fuels. This propaganda 
  creates a world that suffers from an "artificial need" for oil that allows the 
  elites to be very rich and very powerful. "He who has the gold rules." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So what does the government do with these flying saucers. 
  Right now they are being built and stored all over the world. Cold Lake Alberta 
  in Canada has an underground manufacturing plant much like America has with 
  it's Area 51 in Nevada. Right now the elites are trying to bring about a New 
  World Order. The New World Order is a one world government set up under the 
  United Nations with a new world dictator acting as commander and chief. The 
  foundation of power for this Reich is already in place. Now they just have to 
  convince the people to relinquish all their constitutional rights and surrender 
  to the New World Order. Most people are not willing to do this as they see the 
  New World Order as a threat to their way of life. This is why Militia memberships 
  are at an all time high and growing everyday. So how does the flying saucer 
  technology fit in to all this? </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"Today America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered 
  Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially 
  true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether 
  real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all 
  peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing 
  that man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual 
  rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being 
  granted to them by the world government." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Henry Kissinger 1991 </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Remember how President Ronald Reagan had stated that 
  if we were attacked by a power from outer space the world would then unite into 
  one? In 1985 President Reagan told Mikhail Gorbachev at a Geneva summit meeting 
  that: </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I couldn't help but say to him , just how easy his task 
  and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat 
  to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. 
  We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries 
  and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here 
  on the Earth together." Reuters, "Reagan Images Star Wars," International Herald 
  Tribune, Paris, Dec. 5th, 1985 </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"The Soviets and the democracies will adopt the best 
  characteristics of each other and, in the process of many years, there will 
  not be a strict line of demarcation between their ideals; therefore no causes 
  for war between them...because of the the developments of science all the countries 
  on earth will have to unite to survive and make a common front against attack 
  by people from other planets." New York Times "M'Arthur Greets Mayor of Naples," 
  Oct. 8, 1955 </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> It's interesting to note here how he uses the word "people" 
  from other planets and not the word creatures or aliens. Does he use the word 
  people because he feels that they will look so much like us? Will they in fact 
  be human pilots. Aliens from the Pentagon so to speak. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> On January 7th, 1948 a UFO was spotted in Kentucky and 
  Three F-51 Mustang fighter planes under the command of Captain Thomas Mantel 
  gave chase. Two of the planes had to turn back as Mantel continued in hot pursuit. 
  Unfortunately Captain Mantel's radio degraded to a point where it became silent. 
  The next morning the wreckage of his fighter plane was found strewn all all 
  over the ground. According to Renato Vesco and David Childress authors of "Man 
  Made UFOs 1944-1994," Mantel's last words over the radio were, "My God! There 
  are men in it!" Perhaps aliens from planet earth? </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> As I have stated, the whole foundation to this new world 
  government is now in place. It's no longer a question of how, but a question 
  of when. What's needed now is for the elite government to release all the man-made 
  UFOs so that people will be convinced that we are being invaded from another 
  world. But first the masses have to be prepared psychologically for for this 
  event. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Right now there is a massive media frenzy about UFOs 
  as well as NASA claiming to have found evidence of life on mars. Movies like 
  independence day and TV shows such as Dark Skies are spreading the message that 
  Aliens are hostile and will stop at nothing to in order to conquer us all. Timed 
  to go with this propaganda blitz is the Roswell Anniversary. With Roswell they 
  are trying to convince us that an alien ship crashed landed in the Nevada desert 
  killing all the aliens aboard. Myth has it that the alien bodies have been kept 
  under lock and key by the American government. Through Roswell, the government 
  is trying to make it appear that they have a captured alien UFO. If you study 
  the CIA and how they operate, you will soon discover how very good they are 
  at creating myths. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So why the myth that the government is hiding the fact 
  that they have a captured UFO? Well it's for two reasons. One is to convince 
  people that there really is life out there. The other reason is that when all 
  of a sudden we see all these UFOs hovering over the city to scare us in to a 
  New World Order, other UFOs (our UFOs) will suddenly appear in the skies to 
  fight in a mock battle. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So how will the American government explain the sudden 
  emergence of this "new" UFO technology that comes out of nowhere? They will 
  say, "Yes folks. The Roswell incident was true. It's also true that we have 
  been "back-engineering" a captured craft in area Area 51. The crafts that you 
  see with the American flags painted on them belong to us and from the Area 51 
  development centre. This will act as a perfect explanation as to why all of 
  a sudden we have our own UFOs to fight back with. This phony war will be a sure 
  propaganda victory a New World Order Dictator. According to the Bible, it says, 
  "...and they worshipped the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, "Who 
  is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?...And authority was given 
  him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. And all who dwell on the earth will 
  worship him..." Revelation 13:5 NKJ </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"No one will enter the New World Order unless he or 
  she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless 
  he will take a Luciferian Initiation." David Spangler, Director of Planetary 
  Initiative, (a United Nations World government group) </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> As history has taught us, the Nazi's were an occult 
  party that created a New Age movement called Nazism, and according to the Bible, 
  history is about to repeat itself! In closing I would like to say that Bob Lazar 
  (a famous Area 51 whistle blower) has claimed on film that one of the UFO's 
  he had seen in Area 51 had an American flag on it. Need I say anymore? </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF">"We shall have World Government, whether or not we like 
  it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest 
  or consent." James P. Warburg </font>
