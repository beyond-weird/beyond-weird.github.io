                                              prepare a careful record of research.
                                                  a.   Certain actions induce the flow of the breath

                                                       conversely, the flow of the breath through
                                                       Pingala induces certain actions.
                                                  b.   Certain other actions induce the flow of the
                                                       breath through the left nostril (Ida), and
                                                       conversely.
                                                  c.   Yet a third class of actions induce the flow of
                                                       the breath through both nostrils at once
                                                       (Sushumna), and conversely.

                                                       interdependent with the distance from the

                                              Liber E. Further, let the Zelator accomplished in those
                                              practices endeavour to master a cycle of 10, 20, 40
                                              or even 16, 32, 64. But let this be done gradually and
                                              with due caution. And when he is steady and easy
                                              both in Asana and Pranayama, let him still further
                                              increase the period.
                                              Thus let him investigate these statements which
                                              follow: ---
                                                  a.   If Pranayama be properly performed, the
                                                       body will first of all become covered with
                                                       sweat. This sweat is different in character
                                                       from that customarily induced by exertion. If
                                                       the Practitioner rub this sweat thoroughly into
                                                       his body, he will greatly strengthen it.
                                                  b.   The tendency to perspiration will stoÿ as the
                                                       practice is continued, and the body become
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                                automatically rigid.
                                                Describe this rigidity with minute accuracy.
                                             c. The state of automatic rigidity will develop
                                                into a state characterised by violent
                                                spasmodic movements of which the
                                                Practitioner is unconscious, but of whose
                                                result he is aware. This result is that the body
                                                hops gently from place to place. After the first
                                                two or three occurrences of this experience,
                                                Asana is not lost. The body appears (on
                                                another theory) to have lost its weight almost
                                                completely and to be moved by an unknown
                                                force.
                                             d. As a development of this stage, the body
                                                rises into the air, and remains there for an
                                                appreciably long period, from a second to an
                                                hour or more.

Let him further investigate any mental results which may occur.

                                    6.  7KLUG 3UDFWLFH --- In order both to economise his time
                                        and to develoÿ his powers, let the Zelator practise the
                                        deep full breathing which his preliminary exercises
                                        will have taught him during his walks. Let him repeat
                                        a sacred sentence (mantra) or let him count, in such
                                        a way that his footfall beats accurately with the
                                        rhythm thereof, as is done in dancing. Then let him
                                        practise Pranayama, at first without the Kumbhakam,

and paying no attention to the nostrils otherwise than to keep them clear. Let him begin by
an indrawing of the breath for 4 paces, and a breathing out for 4 paces. Let him increase
this gradually to 6.6, 8.8, 12.12, 16.16 and 24.24, or more if he be able. Next let him
practise in the proper pr portion 4.8, 6.12, 8.16, 12.24 and so on. Then if he choose, let
him recommence the series, adding a gradually increasing period of Kumbhakam.

                                        him quicken his mantra and his pace until the walk
                                        develops into a dance. This may also be practised
                                        with the ordinary waltz step, using a mantra in three-
                                        time, such as GR:epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-

                                        may be combined with devotion to a particular deity:
                                        see Liber CLXXV. For the dance as such it is better
                                        to use a mantra of a non-committal character, such
                                        as GR:Tau-omicron GR:epsilon-iota-nu-alpha-iota,

                                   concentration during the dance, and investigate the
                                   following experiments:
                                        a.  The dance becomes independent of the will.
                                        b.  Similar phenomena to those described in 5
                                            (a), (b), (c), (d), occur.
                              9.   A note concerning the depth and fullness of the
                                   breathing. In all pr per expiration the last possible
                                   portion of air should be expelled. In this the muscles
                                   of the throat, chest, ribs, and abdomen must be fully
                                   employed, and aided by the pressing of the upper
                                   arms into the flanks, and of the head into the thorax.
                                   In all proper inspiration the last possible portion of air
                                   must be drawn into the lungs.
                                   In all proper holding of the breath, the body must
                                   remain absolutely still.
                                   Ten minutes of such practice is ample to induce
                                   profuse sweating in any place of a temperature of 17
                                   Degree C or over.
                                   The progress of the Zelator in acquiring a depth and
                                   fullness of breath should be tested by the
                                   respirometer.
                                   The exercises should be carefully graduated to avoid
                                   overstrain and possible damage to the lungs.
                                   This depth and fullness of breath should be kept as
                                   much as possible, even in the rapid exercises, with

                                   the exception of the sixth practice following.

                                   and rapidly as possible. He should assume the
                                   attitude of his moment of greatest expiration, and
                                   breathe only with the muscles of his throat. He may

                                         insects and all other disturbing influences,

a retired situation, simple food eaten in great moderation at the conclusion of the practices
of morning and afternoon, and on no account before practising. Bodily health is almost
essential, and should be most carefully guarded (See Liber CLXXXV, "Task of a
Neophyte"). A diligent and tractable disciple, or the Practicus of the Zelator, should aid him
in his work. Such a disciple should be noiseless, patient, vigilant, prompt, cheerful, of gentle
manner and reverent to his master, intelligent to anticipate his wants, cleanly and gracious,
not given to speech, devoted and unselfish. With all this he should be fierce and terrible to
strangers and all hostile influences, determined and vigorous, increasingly vigilant, the
guardian of the threshold.
It is not desirable that the Zelator should employ any other creature than a man, save in
cases of necessity. Yet for some of these purposes a dog will serve, for others a woman.
There are also others appointed to serve, but these are not for the Zelator.

                                     15. 7HQWK 3UDFWLFH --- Let the Zelator experiment if he will
                                         with inhalations of oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon
                                         dioxide, and other gases mixed in small proportion
                                         with his air during his practices. These experiments
                                         are to be conducted with caution in the presence of a
                                         medical man of experience, and they are only useful
                                         as facilitating a simulacrum of the results of the
                                         proper practices and thereby enheartening the

                                        Kumbhakam, throw his will utterly towards his Holy
                                        Guardian Angel, directing his eyes inward and
                                        upward, and turning back his tongue as if to swallow
                                        it. (This latter operation is facilitated by severing the
                                        fraenum linguae, which, if done, should be done by a
                                        competent surgeon. We do not advise this or any
                                        similar method of cheating difficulties. This is,
                                        however, harmless.)

                                        may have been made throughout the course of this
                                        instruction, and reflect that even the counsel which
                                        we have given as suitable to the average case may
