    "Direct not thy mind to the vast surfaces of the earth; for the Plant
of Truth grows not upon the ground. Nor measure the motions of the
Sun, collecting rules, for he is carried by the Eternal Will of the
Father, and not for your sake alone. Dismiss from your mind the
impetuous course of the Moon, for she moveth always by the power of
Necessity. The pro-gression of the Stars was not generated for your
sake. The wide aerial flight of birds gives no true knowledge, nor the
dissection of the entrails of victims; these are all mere toys, the basis
of mercenary fraud: flee from these if you would enter the sacred
paradise of piety where Virtue, Wisdom, and Equity are assembled."

THINK fixedly of the demand; with a pencil mark 16 lines of
points or dashes.       Find whether number of points in each
line is odd or even. For odd l; for even ll. Lines 1-4 give the
first mother; lines 5-8 the second; and so on.

                               EXAMPLE

           4              3                2             1

        l l 10           l      9         l     15     l l 16
        l l 10           l      7       l l 14         l l 14

      [The small Arabic numbers refer to the chance number of dashes.]


    Use clean (virgin) paper; place appropriate Pentagram (either
with or without a circumscribed circle) invoking. If a circle,
draw this first. Sigil of Ruler to which nature of question most
refers should be placed in the Pentagram thus:
        ' Agriculture, sorrow, death.
        & Good fortune, feasting, church preferment.
        % War, victory, fighting.
        ! Power, magistracy.
        $ Love, music, pleasure.
        # Science, learning, knavery.
        " Travelling, fishing, &c.

    In diagram, p. 6, the Sigil of Hismael should be used.
    In marking points fix attention on Sigil and on the question
proposed; the hand should not be moved from the paper till
complete. It is convenient to rule lines, to guide the eye.

    The daughters are derived by reading the mothers
horizontally.
    The four nephews, Figures IX-XII, are thus formed:
IX = I + II read vertically, added and taken as odd or even.
So also XIII = IX + X, and XV = XIII + XIV.

    These last three are merely aids to general judgement. If the
judge be good the figure is good, and vice-versâ.
    The Reconciler = I + XV.
    To find the Part of Fortune , (ready money or cash
belonging to the Querent), add points of the figures I-XII, divide
by 12, and remainder shows figure. Here I + II + . . . + XII = 74
points = 6 × 12 + 2.  , falls with v (II).

       OF THE FIGURE OF THE TWELVE HOUSES OF HEAVEN

THE meaning of the twelve Houses is to be found, primarily, in
any text-book of Astrology. Knowledge is to be enlarged and
corrected by constant study and practice.

   Place the figures thus:

THE tables are classed by the Left Witness.

                               CHAPTER V

         THE GENERAL MEANING OF THE SIXTEEN FIGURES IN

                          THE TWELVE HOUSES

HEREIN follows a set of general tables of the sixteen figures
in the twelve Houses, for the better convenience of forming a
general judgement of the scheme. Under the head of each figure
separately     is    given     its     general     effect    in     whatever
House it may happen to fall.
     Thus, by taking the House signifying the thing demanded,
and also that signifying the end of the matter (fourth House), and
noticing what figures fall therein, you may find by these tables
their general effect in that position.

OF THE ESSENTIAL DIGNITIES OF THE FIGURES IN THE HOUSES; OF
     THE ASPECTS OF THE HOUSES; AND OF THE FRIENDSHIP AND
     EMNITY OF THE RULERS IN ASPECTS, ETC.

BY Essential Dignity is meant the strength of a figure when
found in a particular House. A figure is therefore strongest
in what is called its House; very strong in its Exaltation;
strong in its Triplicity; very weak in its Fall; weakest of all
in its Detriment. A figure is in its Fall when in a House opposite
to that of its Exaltation; in is Detriment when opposite to its own
House. The following list shows the Essential Dignities; that is
to say, they follow the Dignities of their Ruling Planets,
considering the twelve Houses of the scheme as answering to the
twelve signs, thus: Asc. to a, 2 to b, 3 to c, &c., . . . 12 to l.
Therefore % figures will be strong in Asc. and weak in 7th and so
on. See chapter I. for attribution of figures to planets.

    The Asc. is aspected by 11, 10, 9 (as Â À and D Dexter and by
3, 4, 5 . . . Sinister, and has 7 in opposition.
    The Dexter aspect is that which is contrary to the natural
order of the Houses; it is stronger than the Sinister.           So
for other Houses.          Figures have Friends and Enemies:--
' : & ! # " Friends; % $ Enemies. & : ' ! $ # "; and %.
% : $ ; and " ' ! #. ! : & ! $ # "; and '. $ : & ! % # ; and '.
# : ' & ! $ " ; and %. " : & ! $ # ; and ' and %.
    Also figures of B are sympathetic with those of B, friendly
with D and E; hostile to C.
    So C symp. C, friendly D and E, and host. B : D symp D,
friendly B and C, and host. E. E symp. E, friendly C and B,
and host. D. Again, sign figures are friends to those Â or D, and
hostile to those À or in Á.

                           CHAPTER VII

           OF THE GENERAL METHOD OF JUDGING A FIGURE

REMEMBER always that if | or q fall in the Ascendant, the figure
is not fit for judgement. Destroy it instantly, and erect a new
figure not less than two hours afterwards.
    Your figure being thoroughly arranged as on p. 6, note first to
what House the demand belongs. Then look for Witnesses and
Judge in their special table, and see what is said under the head
of the demand. Put this down. Note next what figure falls into
the House required (if it spring into other Houses, these too
should be considered); e.g. in a question of money stolen, if the
figure in 2nd be also in 6th it might show the thief to be a servant
in the house. Look next in the Table of Figures in the Houses,
and see what the figure signifies in the especial House under
consideration. Put this down also. Then by the Table of Aspects
(p. 20) note down the figures Â À D and Á, putting good on one
side, evil on the other; noting also the strength or weakness,
friendliness or hostility to the figure of the House required, of
these figures. Then add the meaning of the figure in the 4th, to
signify the end of the matter. It may also assist you to form a
Reconciler from the figure in the House required and the Judge,
noting what figure results and whether it harmonises with one or
both by nature (p. 20). Now consider all you have written, and
according to the balance of Good and Evil, form your final
judgement. Consider also always in money questions where the
Part of Fortune falls.
    Take, e.g., the figure on p. 6, and form a judgement for loss
of money in business therefrom.
    Table of Witnesses and Judge say: Moderate.
    In 2nd is x. Evil, showing obstacle, delay.



                                                                 21

                          LIBER GAIAS

   Part of Fortune , is in Asc. with v, showing loss through
Querent's own blunders.
   x springs into no other Houses;  this does not affect the
question.
   The figures Â and D of 2nd are w, t, s, and u, all good
figures and friendly in nature = Well-intentioned help of friends.
   The figures À and Á are t, w, {, which are not hostile to x;
therefore shows opposition not great.
   The figure in the 4th is t, which shows a good end, but with
anxiety.
   Forming a Reconciler we get t again, a sympathetic figure
but denoting delay = Delay, but helping Querent's wishes.
   Adding all together--
       1. Medium.
       2. Evil and obstacles, delay;
       3. Loss through Querent's self;
       4. Strength for evil, medium only;
       5. Well-intentioned aid of friends;
       6. Not much opposition from enemies.
       7. Ending good, but with anxiety;
       8. Delay, but helping Querent's wishes--
we formulate this judgement:
   That the Querent's loss in business has been principally
owing to his own mismanagement; that he will have a long and
hard struggle, but will meet with help from friends; that his
obstacles will gradually give way; and that after much anxiety he
will eventually recoup himself for his previous losses.
