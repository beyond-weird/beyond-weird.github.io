                         The Task of a Probationer
 0. Let any person be received by a Neophyte, the latter being responsible to his Zelator.
 1. The period of Probation shall be at least one year.
 2. The aspirant to the AA shall hear the Lection (Liber LXI) and this note of his
     office; IF HE WILL, shall then procure the robe of a Probationer; shall choose with
     deep forethought and intense solemnity a motto.
 3. On reception he shall receive the robe, sign the form provided and repeat the oath as
     appointed, and receive the First Volume of the Book.
 4. He shall commit a chapter of Liber LXV to memory; and furthermore, he shall study
     the Publications of the AA in Class B, and apply himself to such practices of
     Scientific Illuminism as seemeth him good.
 5. Beside all this, he shall perform any tasks that the AA may see fit to lay upon
     him. Let him be mindful that the word Probationer is no idle term, but that the
     Brothers will in many a subtle way prove him, when he knoweth it not.
 6. When the sun shall next enter the sign under which he hath been received, his
     initiation may be granted unto him. He shall keep himself free from all other
     engagements for one whole week from that date.
 7. He may at any moment withdraw from his association with the AA simply
     notifying the Neophyte who introduced him.
 8. He shall everywhere proclaim openly his connection with the AA and speak of It
     and Its principles (even so little as he understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of
     truth.
         One month before the completion of his year, he shall deliver a copy of the record
     to the Neophyte introducing, and repeat to him his chosen chapter of Liber LXV.
 9. He shall hold himself chaste, and reverent toward his body, for that the ordeal of
     initiation is no light one. This is of peculiar importance in the last two months of his
     Probation.
10. Thus and not otherwise may he attain the great reward, YEA, MAY HE ATTAIN THE
     GREAT REWARD!

                       The Task of a Neophyte
 0. Let any Probationer who has coomplished his task to the satisfaction of the AA be
    instructed in the proper course of procedure: which is:--Let him read through this note
    of his office, and sign it, paying the sum of One Guinea for Liber VII which will be
    given him on his initiation, and One Guinea for this Portfolio of Class D publications,
    B-G. Let him obtain the robe of a Neophyte, and entrust the same to the care of his
    Neophyte.
       He shall choose a new motto with deep forethought and intense solemnity, as
    expressing the clearer consciousness of his Aspiration which the year's Probation has
    given him.
       Let him make an appointment with his Neophyte at the pleasure of the latter for
   the ceremony of Initiation.
 1. The Neophyte shall not proceed to the grade of Zelator in less than eight months; but
    shall hold himself free for four days for advancement at the end of that period.
 2. He shall pass the four tests called the Powers of the Sphinx.
 3. He shall apply himself to understand the nature of his Initation.
 4. He shall commit to memory a chapter of Liber VII; and furthermore, he shall study
    and practice Liber O in all its branches: also he shall begin to study Liber H and some
    one commonly accepted method of divination. He will further be examined in his
    power of Journeying in the Spirit Vision.
 5. Beside all this, he shall perform any tasks that his Zelator in the name of the AA
    and by its authority may see fit to lay upon him. Let him be mindful that the word
    Neophyte is no idle term, but that in many a subtle way the new nature will stir within
    him, when he knoweth it not.
 6. When the sun shall next enter the sign 240° to that under which he hath been received,
    his advancement may be granted unto him. He shall keep himself free from all other
   engagements for four whole days from that date.
 7. He may at any moment withdraw from his association with the AA, simply
   notifying the Zelator who introduced him.
 8. He shall everywhere proclaim openly his connection with the AA and speak of It
   and Its principles (even so little as he understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of
   truth.
       Furthermore, he shall construct the magic Pentacle, according to the instruction in
   Liber A.
   One month before the completion of his eight months, he shall deliver a copy of his
   Record to his Zelator, pass the necessary tests, and repeat to him his chosen chapter of
   Liber VII.
 9. He shall in every way fortify his body according to the advice of his Zelator, for that
    the ordeal of advancement is no light one.
10. Thus and not otherwise may he attain the great reward, YEA, MAY HE ATTAIN THE
    GREAT REWARD!

    instructed in the proper course of procedure: which is:--
        Let him read through this note of his office, and sign it, paying the sum of Three
    Guineas for the volume containing Liber CCXX, Liber XXVII and Liber DCCCXIII,
    which will be given him on his initiation.

    entrust the same to the care of his Zelator.

    ceremony of initiation.
 1. The Zelator shall proceed to the grade of Practicus at any time that authority confers it.
 2. He shall pass Examinations in Liber E, Posture and Breathing. He shall have attained
    complete success in the former, i.e., the chosen posture shall be perfectly steady and
    easy; and attained the second stage in the latter, i.e., automatic rigidity.
 3. He shall further show some acquaintance with and experience of the meditations
    given in Liber HHH. And in this his Record shall be his witness.
 4. He shall commit to memory a chapter of Liber CCXX; he shall pass examinations in
    Liber HHH.
 5. Beside all this, he shall apply himself to work for the AA upon his own
   responsibility.
        Let him be mindful that the word Zelator is no idle term; but that a certain Zeal
   will be inflamed within him, why he knoweth not.
 6. When authority confers the grade, he shall rejoice therein; but beware, for that is his
    first departure from the middle pillar of the Tree of Life.
 7. He may at any moment withdraw from his association with the AA, simply
   notifying the Practicus who introduced him.
        Yet let him remember that being entered thus far upon the Path, he cannot escape
   it, and return to the world, but must ultimate either in the City of the Pyramids or the
   lonely towers of the Abyss.
 8. He shall everywhere proclaim openly his connection with the AAand speak of It
    and Its principles (even so little as he understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of
   truth. Furthermore, he shall construct the magic Dagger, according to the instruction
   in Liber A.
        One month after his admission to the Grade he shall go to his Practicus, pass the
   necessary tests, and repeat to him his chosen chapter of Liber CCXX.
 9. He shall in every way establish perfect control of his Automatic Consciousness
    according to the advice of his Practicus, for that the ordeal of advancement is no light
    one.
