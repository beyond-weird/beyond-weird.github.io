                 Go back to Swinburne's19 counsel rare,
                 Kissing the universe its rod,
                 As thus he sings "For this is God ;
                 Be man with might, at any rate,
                 In strength of spirit growing straight                     90

                 So Swinburne doth sublimely state,
                 And he is right beyond a doubt.
                 So, I'm a poet or a rhymer ;

                Besides mere ratiocination,
                Of twenty other things as well,
                The first of which is concentration !

Some poetry.    There is a lake* amid the snows
                Wherein five glaciers merge and break.                                    420
                Oh ! the deep brilliance of the lake !
                The roar of ice that cracks and goes
                Crashing within the water ! Glows
                The pale pure water, shakes and slides
                The glittering sun through emerald tides,                                 425
                So that faint ripples of young light
                Laugh on the green. Is there a night

                   * This simile for the mind and its impressions, which must be stilled before
                the sun of the soul can be reflected, is common in Hindu literature. The five
                glaciers are, of course, the senses.

Ah !

Into a glory subtler still.
Here the intense abode of Will
Closes its gates, and in the hall
Is solemn sleep of festival.
Peace ! Peace ! Silence of peace !           450
O visionless abode ! Cease ! Cease !
Through the dark veil press on ! The veil
Is rent asunder, the stars pale,
The suns vanish, the moon drops,
The chorus of the spirit stops,              455
But one note swells. Mightiest souls
Of bard and music maker, rolls
Over your loftiest crowns the wheel
Of that abiding bliss. Life flees
Down corridors of centuries                  460
Pillar by pillar, and is lost.
Life after life in wild appeal
Cries to the master ; he remains
And thinks not.
                   The polluting tides       465
Of sense roll shoreward. Arid plains
Of wave-swept sea confront me. Nay !
Looms yet the glory through the grey,
And in the darkest hours of youth
I yet perceive the essential truth,          470

                "O God," I prayed, "for Jesus' sake
                Grant thy poor servant all his wish !        560
                For every prayer produce a fish !"
                Nine times the prayer went up the spout,
                And eight times--what a thumping trout !
                (This is the only true fish-story
                I ever heard--give God the glory !)          565
                The things seems cruel now, of course.
                Still, it's a grand case of God's force !
                But, modern Christians, do you dare
                With common prudence to compare
                The efficacity of prayer ?                   570

                round like moons. She held in leash the four Beasts, but he strode boldly
                to her, and kissed her full on the lips. Wherefore she signed and fell
                back a space, and he pressed on. Now at the end of the darkness a fire
Intellectus.    glowed: she would have hindered him: clung she to his neck and wept.
                But the fire grew and the light dazzled her; so that with a shriek she fell.
                But the beasts flung themselves against the burning gateway of iron, and
                it gave way. Our Father passed into the fire. Some say that it consumed
Deus.           him utterly and that he died; howbeit, it is certain that he rose from a
                sarcophagus, and in the skies stood an angel with a trumpet, and on that
                trumpet he blew so mighty a blast that the dead rose all from their tombs,
                and our Father among them. "Now away !" he cried. "I would look
                upon the sun !" And with that the fire hissed like a myriad of serpents
                and went out suddenly. It was a green sward golden with buttercups ;
H. et S. V. A.  and in his way lay a high wall. Before it were two children, and with
                obscene gestures they embraced, and laughed aloud, with filthy words and
                acts unspeakable. Over all of which stood the sun calm and radiant, and
                was glad to be. Now, think ye well, was our Father perplexed; and he
                knew not what he would do. For the children left their foulness and
                came soliciting with shameless words his acquiscence in their sport ; and
                he, knowing the law of courtesy and pity, rebuked them not.             But
                master ever of himself he abode alone, about and above. So he saw his
                virginity deflowered, and his thoughts were otherwere. Now loosed they
                his body ; he bade it leap the wall. The giant flower of ocean bloomed
                above him! He had fallen headlong into the great deep. As the green
                and crimson gloom disparted somewhat before his eyes, he was aware of
Luna.           a Beetle that steadily and earnestly moved across the floor of that Sea
                unutterable. Him he followed; "for I wit well," thought the Adept,
                "that he goeth not back to the gross sun of earth. And if the sun hath
                become a beetle, may the beetle transform unto a bird." Wherewith he

                Now the jackal he knew; and the tower he knew not yet. Not two
                would he conquer--that were easy: to victory over one did he aspire.
                Made he therefore toward the moon. Rough was the hillside and the
                shadows deep and treacherous; as he advanced the towers seemed to
                approach onoe another closer and closer yet. He drew his sword : with
                a crash they came together; and he fell with wrath upon a single fortress.
Deo Duce        Three windows had the tower; and against it ten cannons thundered.
Comite Ferro.   Eleven bricks had fallen dislodged by lightning : it was no house wherein
                our Father might abide. But there he must abide. "To destroy it I am
                come," he said. And through he passed out therewithal, yet 'twas his
Vestigia Nulla  home until he had attained. So at last he came to a river, and sailing to its
Retrorsum.      source he found a fair woman all naked, and she filled the river from two
                vessels of pure water. "She-devil," he cried, "have I gone back one
                step ?" For the Star Venus burned above. And with his sword he
                clave her from the head to the feet, that she fell clean asunder. Cried
                the echo: "Ah ! thou hast slain hope now !" Our Father gladdened at

               that word, and wiping his blade he kissed it and went on, knowing
               that his luck should now be ill. And ill it was, for a temple was set up in
Adest Rosa     his way, and there he saw the grisly Goat enthroned. But he knew
Secreta Eros.  better than to judge a goat from a goat's head and hoofs. And the first
               week he sacrificed to that goat1 a crown every day. The second a phallus.
               The third a silver vase of blood. The fourth a royal sceptre. The fifth
               a sword. The sixth a heart. The seventh a garland of flowers. The eighth
               a grass-snake. The ninth a sickle. And the tenth week did he daily offer
               up his own body.              Said the goat: "Though I be not an ox,
               yet am I a sword." "Masked, O God !" cried the Adept. "Verily, an
               thou hadst not sacrificed--" There was silence. And under the Goat's
               throne was a rainbow2 of seven colours: our Father fitted himself as an
Hermaphrodi-   arrow to the string (and the string was waxed well, dipped in a leaden pot
tus.           wherein boiled amber and wine) and shot through stormy heavens. And
               they that saw him saw a woman wondrous fair3 robed in flames of hair,
               moon-sandalled, sun-belted, with torch and vase of fire and water. And
               he trailed comet-clouds of glory upward.
                  Thus came our Father (Blessed be his name!) to Death,4 who stood,
               scythe in hand, opposed. And ever and anon he swept round, and men
               fell before him. "Look," said Death, "my sickle hath a cross-handle. See
               how they grow like flowers !" "Give me salt !" quoth our Father.
Mors Janua     And with sulphur (that the Goat had given him) and with salt did he
Vitae.         bestrew the ground. "I see we shall have ado together," says Death.
               "Aye!" and with that he lops off Death's cross-handle. Now Death
               was wroth indeed, for he saw that our Father had wit of his designs (and
               they were right foul !), but he bade him pass forthwith through his dominion.
               And our Father could not at that time stay him: though for himself had he
               cut off the grip, yet for others--well, let each man take his sword!
Adeptus.       The way went through a forest. Now between two trees hung a man by
               one heel (Love was that tree).5 Crossed were his legs, and his arms
               behind his head, that hung ever downwards, the fingers locked. "Who
               art thou ?" quoth our Father.            "He that came before thee."         "Who
               am I ?" "He that cometh after me." With that worshipped our Father, and
               took a present of a great jewel from him, and went his ways. And
               he was bitterly a-cold, for that was the great Water he had passed. But
               our Father's paps glittered with cold, black light, and likewise his navel.

               and down as a very cork on waters of wailing. "Woman," he bade
               sternly, "be still.      Cleave that with thy sword: or that must I well
               work?" But she cleft the cords, bitter-faced, smiling goddess as she was;

               and he went on. "Leave thine ox-goad,"1 quoth he, "till I come back
               an ox!" And she laughed and let him pass. Now is our Father come

               wand were his. In his path a lion roared, but to it ran a maiden, strong as
               a young elephant, and held its cruel jaws. But force he ran to her : he
               freed the lion--one buffet of his hand dashed her back six paces !
               --and with another blow smote its head from its body. And he ran to
               her and by force embraced her. Struggled she and fought him: savagely
Femina Rapta   she bit, but it was of no avail: she lay ravished and exhausted on the

               and thou shalt conquer it and it shall serve thee: and they, they also for
               a guide!" She ceased; and he, having come to the world's end, pre-
               pared his chariot. Foresquare he builded it, and that double: he har-
               nessed the two sphinxes that he had made from one, and sailed, crab-
               fashion, backwards, through the amber skies of even. Wherefore he
               attained to see his children. Lovers they were and lovely, those twins of

Pleiades.      our Father, and for seven nights he slept in seven starry palaces, and a

               are two, being four. And on the sixth day (for the seven days were past)
               he rose and came into his ancient temple, a temple of our Holy Order, O
               my Brethren, wherein sat that Hierophant who had initiated him of old.
               Now read he well the riddle of the Goat (Blessed be his name among us
               for ever ! Nay, not for ever !), and therewith the Teacher made him a

               (who is Solomon) told him of Sheba's Land and of one fairest of women
               there enthroned. So he journeyed thither, and for four years and seven

alibus.        the marriage of that virgin was on this wise: She had three arrows, yet but
               two flanks, and the wise men said that who knew two was three,1 should
               know three was eight,2 if the circle were but squared; and this also one
               day shall ye know, my Brethren ! And she gave him the great and perfect
               gift of Magic, so that he fared forth right comely and well-provided. Now at
The Sophic     that great wedding was a Suggler,3 a riddler : for he said, "Thou hast
Suggler.       beasts : I will give thee weapons one for one." For the Lion did our
               Father win a little fiery wand like a flame, and for his Eagle a cup of ever
               flowing water : for his Man the Suggler gave him a golden-hilted dagger (yet
               this was the worst of all his bargains, for it could not strike other, but him-self
               only), while for a curious coin he bartered his good Bull. Alas for our Father!
               Now the Suggler mocks him and cries: "Four fool's bargains hast thou
               made, and thou art fit to go forth and meet a fool4 for thy mate." But our
               Father counted thrice seven and cried: "One for the fool," seeing

               the Serpent should be his at last. "None for the fool," they laughed
               back--nay, even his maiden queen. For she would not any should know
               thereof. Yet all were right, both he and they. But truth ran quickly about;
Hammer of      for that was the House of Truth; and Mercury stood far from the Sun. Yet
Thor.          the Suggler was ever in the Sign of Sorrow, and the Fig Tree was not far.
               So went our Father to the Fool's Paradise of Air. But it is not lawful that I
               should write to you, brethren, of what there came to him at that place and
               time; nor indeed is it true, if it were written. For alway doth this Arcanum

Griphus I.        The maiden is blind.
                  Our Father : She shall be what she doth not.
                  And a second virgin came forth to him and said :
                  The second riddle : Detegitur Yod.
Griphus II.       Quoth our Father : The moon is full.
                  So also a third virgin the third riddle :
Griphus III.      Man and woman : O fountain of the balance!
                  To whom our Father answered with a swift flash of his sword, so swift
              she saw it not.
                  Came a fourth virgin, having a fourth riddle :
Griphus IV.       What egg hath no shell ?
                  And our Father pondered a while and then said :
                  On a wave of the sea : on a shell of the wave : blessed be her name !
                  The fifth virgin issued suddenly and said :
Griphus V.        I have four arms and six sides : red I am, and gold. To whom our Father :
                  Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani !
                  (For wit ye well, there be two Arcana therein.)
                  Then saith the sixth virgin openly :
Griphus VI.       Power lieth in the river of fire.
                  And our Father laughed aloud and answered : I am come from the
              waterfall.
                  So at that the seventh virgin came forth: and her countenance was
Griphus VII.  troubled.
                  The seventh riddle :
                  The oldest said to the most beautiful: What doest thou here ?

                  1 This is obscure.
                  2 0 + 1 + 2 + . . . + 21 = 231.
                  3 The Sephiroth.
                  4 The maiden (Malkuth) is blind (unredeemed). Answer : She shall be what she
               doth not, i.e., see. She shall be the sea, i.e., "exalted to the throne of Binah" (the
               great sea), the Qabalistic phrase to express her redemption.        Weleave it to the
               reader's ingenuity to solve the rest. Each refers to the Sephira indicated by the
               number, but going upward.

                   Our Father :
                   And she answered him : I am in the place of the bridge. Go thou up
               higher : go thou where these are not.
Griphus VIII.      Thereat was commotion and bitter wailing, and the eighth virgin came
               forth with rent attire and cried the eighth riddle :
                   The sea hath conceived.
                   Our Father raised his head, and there was a great darkness.
Griphus IX.        The ninth virgin, sobbing at his feet, the ninth riddle :
                   By wisdom.
                   Then our Father touched his crown and they all rejoiced : but laughing
               he put them aside and he said : Nay ! By six hundred and twenty1 do
               ye exceed!
Griphus X.         Whereat they wept, and the tenth virgin came forth, bearing a royal
               crown having twelve jewels : and she had but one eye, and from that the
               eyelid had been torn. A prodigious beard had she, and all of white :
               and they wist he would have smitten her with his sword. But he would
               not, and she propounded unto him the tenth riddle :
                   Countenance beheld not countenance.
                   So thereto he answered: Our Father, blessed be thou !--
                   Countenance ?
                   Then they brought him the Sword and bade him smite withal : but
               he said :
Culpa Urbium       If countenance behold not countenance, then let the ten be five. And
Nota Terrae.   they wist that he but mocked them ; for he did bend the sword fivefold
               and fashioned therefrom a Star, and they all vanished in that light ; yet
               the lotus abode nine-petalled and he cried, "Before the wheel, the axle."
               So he chained the Sun,2 and slew the Bull, and exhausted the Air,
               breathing it deep into his lungs : then he broke down the ancient tower,
               that which he had made his home, will he nill he, for so long, and he
               slew the other Bull, and he broke the arrow in twain ; after that he was
               silent, for they grew again in sixfold order, so that this latter work was
               double: but unto the first three he laid not his hand, neither for the first
               time, nor for the second time, nor for the third time. So to them he
               added3 that spiritual flame (for they were one, and ten, and fifty, thrice,
               and again) and that was the Beast, the Living One that is Lifan. Let
               us be silent, therefore, my brethren, worshipping the holy sixfold Ox4
               that was our Father in his peace that he had won into, and that so
               hardly. For of this shall no man speak.
                   Now therefore let it be spoken of our Father's journeyings in the land
               of Vo5 and of his sufferin therein, and of the founding of our holy and
               illustrious Order.

               to leave only Ain, Not, or Nothing.

              and fifty and eight years,1 set forth upon a journey into the Mystic Moun-
Abiegnus.     tain of the Caves.           He took with him his Son,2 a Lamb, Life, and
              Strength, for these four were the Keys of that Mountain. So by ten
              days and fifty days and two hundred days and yet ten days he went forth.
              After ten days fell a thunderbolt, whirling through black clouds of rain:
Mysterium     after sixty the road split in two, but he travelled on both at once: after
I. N. R. I.   two hundred and sixty, the sun drove away the rain, and the Star shone
              in the day-time, making it Night. After the last day came his Mother,
              his Redeemer, and Himself ; and joining together they were even as I
              am who write unto you. Seventeen they were, the three Fathers : with
              the three Mothers they were thirty-two, and sixfold therein, being as
              countenance and countenance.                 Yet, being seventeen, they were but
              one, and that one none, as before hath been showed. And this enumera-
Mysterium     tion is a great Mysterium of our art. Whence a light hidden in a Cross.
LVX.          Now therefore having brooded upon the ocean, and smitten with the
              Sword, and the Pyramid being builded in just proportion, was that
              Light fixed even in the Vault of the Caverns. With one stroke he rent
              asunder the Veil; with one stroke he closed the same. And entering
Pastos.       the Sarcophagus of that Royal Tomb he laid him down to sleep. Four
              guarded him, and One in the four; Seven enwalled him, and One in
               the seven, yet were the seven ten, and One in the ten. Now therefore
               his disciples came unto the Vault of that Mystic Mountain, and with the
               Keys they opened the Portal and came to him and woke him. But
               during his long sleep the roses had grown over him, crimson and flaming
               with interior fire, so that he could not escape. Yet they withered at his
               glance ; withat he knew what fearful task was before him. But slaying
               his disciples with long Nails, he interred them there, so that they were
               right sorrowful in their hearts. May we all die so ! And what further
               befell him ye shall also know, but not at this time.
                  Going forth of that Mountain he met also the Fool. Then the discourse
Trinitas.      of that Fool, my Brethren ; it shall repay your pains. They think they are a
               triangle,3 he said, they think as the Picture-Folk. Base they are, and little
               infinitely.

                  Ain Elohim.
Abracadabra.*     The Chariot. Four hundred and eighteen. Five are one, and six are
               diverse, five in the midst and three on each side. The Word of Power,
               double in the Voice of the Master.

Ye Fylfar .       One, and one, and one: Creater, Preserver, Destroyer, ho ! the
               Redeemer ! Thunder-stone: whirlpool: lotus-flower: ho ! for the gold of
               the sages !
                  Ain Elohim.
                  And he was silent for a great while, and so departed our Father from Him.
                  Forth he went along the dusty desert and met an antient woman bear-
Mysterium      ing a bright crown of gold, studded with gems, one on each knee.
Matris.1       Dressed in rags she was, and squatted clumsily on the sand. A horn grew
               from her forehead; and she spat black foam and froth. Foul was the hag and
               evil, yet our Father bowed down flat on his face to the earth. "Holy
               Virgin of God," said he, "what dost thou here ? What wilt thou with
               thy servant ?" At that she stank so that the air gasped about her, like a
               fish brought out of the sea. So she told him she was gathering simples for
               her daughter that had died to bury her withal. Now no simples grew in

Evocatio.      the desert. Therefore our Father drew with his sword lines of power in
               the sand, so that a black and terrible demon appeared squeezing up in thin
               flat plates of flesh along the sword-lines.           So our Father cried :
               "Simples, O Axcaxrabortharax, for my mother !" Then the demon was
               wroth and shrieked : "Thy mother to black hell ! She is mine !" So
               the old hag confessed straight that she had given her body for love to that
               fiend of the pit. But our Father paid no heed thereto and bade the demon
               to do his will, so that he brought him herbs many, and good, with which

Lucus.         our Father planted a great grove that grew about him (for the sun was now
               waxen bitter hot) wherein he worshipped, offering in vessels of clay these
               seven offerings :2
                  The first offering, dust ;
                  The second offering, ashes ;
                  The third offering, sand ;
                  The fourth offering, bay-leaves ;
                  The fifth offering, gold ;
                  The sixth offering, dung ;
                  The seventh offering, poison.
                  With the dust he gave a sickle to gather the harvest of that dust.
                  With the ashes he gave a sceptre, that one might rule them aright.
                  With the sand he gave a sword, to cut that sand withal.
                  With the bay-leaves he ave a sun, to wither them
                  With the gold he gave a garland of sores, and that was for luck.
                  With the dung he gave a Rod of Life to quicken it.

                 With the poison he gave also in offering a stage and a maiden.
Somnium Auri     But about the noon came one shining unto our Father and gave him
Potabilis.    to drink from a dull and heavy bowl. And this was a liquor potent and
              heavy, by'r lady ! So that our Father sank into deep sleep and dreamed a
              dream, and in that mirific dream it seemed unto him that the walls of all
              things slid into and across each other, so that he feared greatly, for the
              stability of the universe is the great enemy; the unstable being the ever-
              lasting, saith Adhou Bim Aram, the Arab. O Elmen Zata, our Sophic
              Pilaster ! Further in the dream there was let down from heaven a mighty
              tessaract, bounded by eight cubes, whereon sat a mighty dolphin having
              eight senses. Further, he beheld a cavern full of most ancient bones of
              men, and therein a lion with the voice of a dog. Then came a voice:
Tredecim      "Thirteen1 are they, who are one. Once is a oneness : twice is the Name:
Voces.        thrice let us say not : by four is the Son : by five is the Sword : by six is
              the Holy Oil of the most Excellent Beard, and the leaves of the Book are
              by six : by seven is that great Amen." Then our Father saw one hundred
              and four horses that drove an ivory car over a sea of pearl, and they
              received him therein and bade him be comforted. With that he awoke and
              saw that he would have all his desire. In the morning therefore he
              arose and went his way into the desert. There he clomb an high rock
Ordinis In-   and called forth the eagles, that their shadow floating over the desert
ceptio.       should be as a book that men might read it. The shadows wrote and the
              sun recorded ; and on this wise cometh it to pass, O my Brethren, that by
              darkness and by sunlight ye will still learn ever these the Arcana of our
              Science. Lo ! who learneth by moonlight, he is the lucky one ! So our
              Father, having thus founded the Order, and our sacred Book being
              opened, rested awhile and beheld many wonders, the like of which were
              never yet told. But ever chiefly his study was to reduce unto eight things
              his many.
                 And thus, O Brethren of our Venerable Order, he at last succeeded.
              Those who know not will learn little herein: yet that they may be
              shamed all shall be put forth at this time clearly before them all, with no
              obscurity nor obfuscation in the exposition thereof.
                 Writing this, saith our Father to me, the Humblest and oldest of all his
              disciples, write as the story of my Quintessential Quest, my Spagyric
              Wandering, my Philosophical Going. Write plainly unto the Brethren,
              quoth he, for many be little and weak ; and thy hard words and much
              learning may confound them.
Vitae.           Therefore I write thus plainly to you. Mark well that ye read me
              aright !
                 Our Father (blessed be his name !) entered the Path on this wise. He
              cut off three from ten :2 thus he left seven. He cut and left three: he cut
              and left one : he cut and became. Thus fourfold. Eightfold.3 He
Viae.         opened his eyes : he cleansed his heart: he chained his tongue : he fixed

              times table."
                 2 These are the Buddhist "paths of enlightment."
                 3 The eightfold path. The rest is very obscure.

               his flesh : he turned to his trade : he put forth his strength : he drew all to
               a point : he delighted.
                   Therefore he is not, having become that which he was not. Mark ye
               all : it is declared. Now of the last adventure of our Father and of his
               going into the land of Apes, that is, England, and of what he did there,
               it is not fitting that I, the poor fool who loved him, shall now dis-
               course. But it is most necessary that I should speak of his holy death and
               of his funeral and of the bruit thereof, for that is gone into diverse lands
               as a false and lying report, whereby much harm and ill-luck come to the
               Brethren. In this place, therefore, will I set down the exact truth of all
               that happened.
Mirabilia.         In the year of the Great Passing Over were signs and wonders seen of
               all men, O my Brethren, as it is written, and well known unto this day.
               And the first sign was of dancing: for every woman that was under the
I. Signum.     moon began to dance and was mad, so that headlong and hot-mouthed
               she flung herself down, desirous.           Whence the second sign, that of
II. Signum.    musical inventions ; for in that year, and of Rosewomen, came A and U
               and M,1 the mighty musicians ! And the third sign likewise, namely, of
III. Signum    animals : for in that year every sheep had lambs thirteen, and every cart2
               was delivered of a wheel ! And other wonders innumerable: they are
Alia Signa.    well known, insomuch that that year is yet held notable.
                   Now our Father, being very old, came into the venerable Grove of our
               August Fraternity and abode there. And so old was he and feeble that
               he could scarce lift his hands in benediction upon us. And all we waited
               about him, both by day and night; lest one word should fall, and we not
               hear the same. But he spake never unto us, though his lips moved and
               his eyes sought ever that which we could not see. At last, on the day of
               D., the mother of P.,3 he straightened himself up and spake. This his final
               discourse was written down then by the dying lions in their own blood,
               traced willingly on the desert sands about the Grove of the Illustrious.
               Also here set down : but who will confirm the same, let him seek it on
               the sands.
                   Children of my Will, said our Father, from whose grey eyes fell
               gentlest tears, it is about the hour. The chariot (Ch.)4 is not, and the
               chariot (H.) is at hand. Yet I, who have been car-borne through the
               blue air by sphinxes, shall never be carried away, not by the whitest
               horses of the world. To you I have no word to say. All is written in
               the sacred Book. To that look ye well !
Pater Jubet :      Ambrose, old friend, he said, turning to me--and I wept ever sore--do
Scientiam      thou write for the little ones, the children of my children, for them
Scribe.        that understand not easily our high Mysteries; for in thy pen is, as it
               were, a river of clear water ; without vagueness, without ambiguity,

               without show of learning, without needless darkening of counsel and word,
               dost thou ever reveal the sacred Heights of our Mystic Mountain. For,
               as for him that understandeth not thy writing, and that easily and well, be
               ye well assured all that he is a vile man and a losel of little worth or
               worship ; a dog, an unclean swine, a worm of filfth, a festering sore in the
               vitals of earth: such an one is liar and murderer, debauched, drunken,
               sexless and spatulate ; an ape-dropping, a lousy, flat-backed knave: from
               such an one keep ye well away ! Use hath he little : ornament maketh
Sedes Profunda he nothing : let him be cast out on the dunghills beyond Jordan; let
Paimonis.      him pass into the S. P. P., and that utterly !
                  With that our Father sighed deep and laid back his reverend head,
               and was silent. But from his heart came a subtle voice of tenderest fare-
Oculi Nox      well, so that we knew him well dead. But for seventy days and seventy
Secreta.       nights we touched him not, but abode ever about him: and the smile
               changed not on his face, and the whole grove was filled with sweet and
Portae Silen-  subtle perfumes. Now on the 71st day arose there a great dispute about
tium
               his body ; for the angels and spirits and demons did contend about it,
Partitio.      that they might possess it. But our eldest brother V. N. bade all be still ;
               and thus he apportioned the sacred relics of our Father.
                  To the Angel Agbagal, the fore part of the skull ;
                  To the demon Ozoz, the back left part of the skull ;
                  To the demon Olcot,1 the back right part of the skull ;
                  To ten thousand myriads of spirits of fire, each one hair ;
                  To ten thousand myriads of spirits of water, each one hair;
                  To ten thousand myriads of spirits of earth, each one hair ;
                  To ten thousand myriads of spirits of air, each one hair ;
                  To the archangel Zazelazel, the brain ;
                  To the angel Usbusolat, the medulla ;
                  To the demon Ululomis, the right nostril ;
                  To the angel Opael, the left nostril ;
                  To the spirit Kuiphiah, the membrane of the nose ;
                  To the spirit Pugrah, the bridge of the nose ;
                  To eleven thousand spirits of spirit, the hairs of the nose, one each ;
                  To the archangel Tuphtuphtuphal, the right eye ;
                  To the archdevil Upsusph, the left eye ;
                  The parts thereof in trust to be divided among their servitors ; as the
               right cornea, to Aphlek ; the left, to Urnbal ;--mighty spirits are they, and
               bold !
                  To the archdevil Rama,3 the right ear and its parts ;
                  To the archangel Umumatis, the left ear and its parts ;
                  The teeth to two-and-thirty letters of the sixfold Name: one to the air,
               and fifteen to the rain and the ram, and ten to the virgin, and six to the
               Bull;
                  The mouth to the archangels Alalal and Bikarak, lip and lip;
                  The tongue to that devil of all devils Yehowou.4 Ho, devil! canst thou
               speak?

            The pharynx to Mahabonisbash, the great angel;
            To seven-and-thirty myriads of legions of planetary spirits the hairs of
         the moustache, to each one;
            To ninety and one myriads of the Elohim, the hairs of the beard; to
         each thirteen, and the oil to ease the world;
            To Shalach, the archdevil, the chin.
            So also with the lesser relics; of which are notable only: to the Order,
         the heart of our Father: to the Book of the Law, his venerable lung-
         space to serve as a shrine thereunto: to the devil Aot, the liver, to be
         divided: to the angel Exarpt and his followers, the great intestine: to
         Bitom the devil and his crew, the little intestine: to Aub, Aud, and
         Aur, the venerable Phallus of our Father: to Ash the little bone of the
         same: to our children K., C., B., C., G., T., N., H., I., and M., his
         illustrious finger-nails, and the toe-nails to be in trust for their children
         after them: and so for all the rest; is it not written in our archives?
         As to his magical weapons, all vanished utterly at the moment of his
         Passing Over. Therefore they carried away our Father's body piece
         by piece and that with reverence and in order, so that there was not left
         of all one hair, nor one nerve, nor one little pore of the skin. Thus
         was there no funeral pomp; they that say other are liars and blasphemers
         against a fame untarnished. May the red plague rot their vitals!
Amen.       Thus, O my Brethren, thus and not otherwise was the Passing Over
         of that Great and Wonderful Magician, our Father and Founder. May
         the dew of his admirable memory moisten the grass of our minds, that
         we may bring forth tender shoots of energy in the Great Work of Works.
         So mote it be!

                                      EPILOGUE

When the chill of earth black-breasted is        Neither I, nor God life-showering, find a
     uplifted at the glance                           counterpart in them.
Of the red sun million-crested, and the forest   As a spirit in a vision shows a countenance
     blossoms dance                                   of fear,
With the light that stirs and lustres of the     Laughs the looker to derision, only comes
     dawn, and with the bloom                         to disappear,
Of the wind's cheek as it clusters from the      Gods and mortals, mind and matter, in the
     hidden valley's gloom;                           glowing bud dissever:
Then I walk in woodland spaces, musing on        Vein from vein they rend and shatter, and
     the solemn ways                                  are nothingness for ever.
Of the immemorial places shut behind the         In the blessed, the enlightened, perfect eyes
     starry rays;                                     these visions pass,
Of the East and all its splendour, of the        Pass and cease, poor shadows frightened,
     West and all its peace;                          leave no stain upon the glass.
And the stubborn lights grow tender, and         One last stroke, O heart-free master, one
     the hard sounds hus and cease.                   last certain calm of will,
In the wheel of heaven revolving, mysteries      And the maker of Disaster shall be stricken
     of death and birth,                              and grow still.
In the womb of time dissolving, shape anew       Burn thou to the core of matter, to the
     a heaven and earth.                              spirit's utmost flame,
Ever changing, ever growing, ever dwind-         Consciousness and sense to shatter, ruin
     ling, ever dear,                                 sight and form and name!
Ever worth the passion growing to distil a       Shatter, lake-reflected spectre; lake, rise up
     doubtful tear.                                   in mist to sun;
These are with me, these are of me, these        Sun, dissolve in showers of nectar, and the
     approve me, these obey,                          Master's work is done.
Choose me, move me, fear me, love me,            Nectar perfume gently stealing, masterful
     master of the night and day.                     and sweet and strong,
These are real, these illusion: I am of them,    Cleanse the world with light of healing in
     false or frail,                                  the ancient House of Wrong!
True or lasting, all is fusion in the spirit's   Free a million million mortals on the wheel
     shadow-veil,                                     of being tossed!
Till the Knowledge-Lotus flowering hides         Open wide the mystic portals, and be
     the world beneath its stem;                      altogether lost!
