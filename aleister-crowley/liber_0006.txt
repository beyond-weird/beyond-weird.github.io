    1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked
to use the most minute critical care in the study of it, even as we
have done in its preparation.
    2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of
Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many
other things that may or may not exist.
    It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain
things, certain results will follow; students are earnestly warned
against attributing objective reality or philosophical validity to
any of them.
    3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:
        (a) A widening of the horizon of the mind.
        (b) An improvement of the control of the mind.
    4. The student, if he attain to success in the following
practices, will find himself confronted by things (ideas or beings)
too glorious or too dreadful to be described. It is essential that he
remain the master of all that he beholds, hears or conceives;
otherwise he will be the slave of illusion, and the prey of
madness.
    Before entering upon any of these practices, the student
should be in good health, and have attained a fair mastery of
sana, prnyma, and dhran.
    5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or
stupid, will fail to get some result; but there is great danger that he
will be led astray, obsessed and overwhelmed by his results, even
though it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain.
Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the

goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight
is well begun.
      It is desirable that the student should never attach to any
result the importance which it at first seems to possess.
      6. First, then, let us consider the Book 777 and its use; the
preparation of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and
finally the methods which follow in Chapter V. "Viator in Regnis
Arboris,"* and in Chapter VI. "Sagitta trans Lunam."
      (In another book will it be treated of the Expansion and Con-
traction of Consciousness; progress by slaying the Cakkrâms; pro-
gress by slaying the Pairs of Opposites; the methods of Sabhapaty
Swmi, &c. &c.)


                                          II

      1. The student must FIRST obtain a thorough knowledge of
Book 777, especially of columns i., ii., iii., v., vi., vii., ix., xi., xii.,
xiv., xv., xvi., xvii., xviii., xix., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxviii., xxxix., xl.,
xli., xlii., xlv., liv., lv., lix., lx., lxi., lxiii., lxx., lxxv., lxxvii., lxxviii.,
lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxiii., xcvii., xcviii., xcix., c., ci., cxvii., cxviii.,
cxxxvii., cxxxviii., cxxxix., clxxv., clxxvi., clxxvii., clxxxii.
      When these are committed to memory, he will begin to
understand the nature of these correspondences. (See Illustrations:
"The Temple of Solomon the King," in Equinox I (2). Cross-
references are given.)
      2. If we take an example the use of the table will become clear.
      Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some
obscure science.
      In column xlv., line 12, you will find "Knowledge of
Sciences."
      By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find
that the Planet corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its

  * [Lat. "The traveller in the Kingdoms of the Tree (scil. of Life)."]
   [Lat. "The arrow beyond the Moon" (the reference being to the path of Samekh on
the Kircher Tree).]

lineal figures the octagon and octagram, the God who rules that
planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragrammaton Adonai
and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its Choir of Angels
Beni Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphthartharath, its
colours Orange (for Mercury is the sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8),
Yellow, Purple, Grey, and Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical
Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes Mastic and others,
its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal or Agate,
its sacred animal the Snake, &c. &c.
      3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accord-
ing. In an orange circle you would draw an eight-pointed star of
yellow, at whose points you would place eight lamps. The Sigil
of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius Agrippa and other
books) you would draw in the four colours with such other
devices as your experiences may suggest.
      4. And so on. We cannot here enter at length into all the
necessary preparations; and the student will find them fully set
forth in the proper books, of which the "Goetia" is perhaps the
best example.
      These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary
the student should do nothing the object of which he does not
understand; also, if he have any capacity whatever, he will find
his own crude rituals more effective than the highly polished ones
of other people.
      The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows:
      5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects,
if it be his wish to master one particular idea, he must make every
material object about him directly suggest that idea. Thus in the
ritual quoted, if his glance fall upon the lights, their number
suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again Mercury is
brought to his mind. In other words, the whole magical apparatus
and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.
      [The importance of these lies principally in the fact that
particular sets of images that the student may meet in his wanderings
_____________________________________________________________________________________

correspond to particular lineal figures, divine names, &c., and are
controlled by them. As to possibility of producing results external
to the mind of the seer (objective, in the ordinary common-sense
acceptation of the term) we are here silent.]
     6. There are three important practices connected with all
forms of ceremonial (and the two Methods which later we shall
describe). These are:
         (1) Assumption of God-forms.
         (2) Vibrations of Divine Names.
         (3) Rituals of "Banishing" and "Invoking."
     These, at least, should be completely mastered before the
dangerous Methods of Chapters V. and VI. are attempted.


                                        III

     1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be
made thoroughly familiar. This can be done by studying them in
any public museum, or in such books as may be accessible to the
student. They should then be carefully painted by him, both from
the model and from memory.
     2. The student, seated in the "God" position, or in the
characteristic attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His
image as coinciding with his own body, or as enveloping it. This
must be practiced until mastery of the image is attained, and an
identity with it and with the God experienced.
     It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain
tests of success in this practice exist.
     3. The vibration of God-names. As a further means of
identifying the human consciousness with that pure portion of it
which man calls by the name of some God, let him act thus:
     4. (a) Stand with arms outstretched. (See Illustration).*
         (b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the

  * This injunction does not apply to gods like Ptah or Harpocrates whose natures do
not accord with this gesture. [Note added in the version of "Liber O" in Magick in
Theory and Practice.]

                   name of the God desired entering with the breath.
          (c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the
                   heart, the solar plexus, the navel, the generative
                   organs, and so to the feet.
          (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly
                   advance the left foot about twelve inches, throw
                   forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back to
                   the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are
                   standing in the typical position of the God Horus,*
                   and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up
                   through the body, while you breathe it out through
                   the nostrils with the air which has been till then
                   retained in the lungs. All this must be done with all
                   the force of which you are capable.
          (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right
                   forefinger upon the lips, so that you are in the
                   characteristic position of the God Harpocrates.
      5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly
when a single "Vibration" entirely exhausts his physical strength.
It should cause him to grow hot all over, or to perspire violently,
and it should so weaken him that he will find it difficult to remain
standing.
      6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself
is it perceived, when he hears the name of the God vehemently
roared forth, as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders; and
it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the
Universe, and not from himself.
      In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but
the God-form and name should be absolutely blotted out; and the
longer it takes for normal perception to return, the better.

   1. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram must be
committed to memory. They are as follows.

               The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram

       (i) Touching the forehead, say Ateh (Unto Thee).
      (ii) Touching the breast, say Malkuth (The Kingdom).
      (iii) Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the
              Power).
      (iv) Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the
              Glory).
       (v) Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm,
              Amen (to the Ages, Amen).
      (vi) Turning to the East, make a Pentagram (that of Earth)
              with the proper weapon (usually the Wand). Say
              (i.e., vibrate) I H V H.
     (vii) Turning to the South, the same, but say A D N I.
    (viii) Turning to the West, the same, but say A H I H.
      (ix) Turning to the North, the same, but say A G L A.

              Pronounce: Ye-ho-wau, Adónai, Eheieh, Agla.

       (x) Extending the arms in the form of a Cross, say:
      (xi) Before me Raphael;
     (xii) Behind me Gabriel;
    (xiii) On my right hand Michael;
     (xiv) On my left hand Auriel;
     (xv) For about me flames the Pentagram;
     (xvi) And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.
(xvii-xxi) Repeat (i) to (v), the "Qabalistic Cross."

              The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram
   The pentagrams are traced in the air with the sword or other
weapon, the name spoken aloud, and the signs used, as illustrated.

                 The Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram
    This ritual is to be performed after the "Lesser Ritual of the
Pentagram."
  (i) Stand upright, feet together, left arm at side, right arm
        across body, holding the wand or other weapon upright in
        the median line. Then face East, and say:
 (ii) I. N. R. I.

       Isis, Apophis, Osiris, IAO.
 (iii) Extend the arms in the form of a cross, and say:
        "The sign of Osiris Slain." (See Illustration.)
 (iv) Raise the right arm to point upwards, keeping the elbow
        square, and lower the left arm to point downwards,
        keeping the elbow square, while turning the head over the
        left shoulder looking down so that the eyes follow the left
        forearm, and say: "The sign of the Mourning of Isis." (See
        Illustration.)
  (v) Raise the arms at an angle of sixty degrees to each other
        above the head, which is thrown back, and say: "The sign
        of Apophis and Typhon." (See Illustration.)
 (vi) Cross the arms on the breast, and bow the head, and say:
        "The sign of Osiris Risen." (See Illustration.)
(vii) Extend the arms again as in (iii) and cross them again as in

           This hexagram consists of two equilateral triangles,
       both apices pointing upwards. Begin at the top of the
       upper triangle and trace it in a dextro-rotary direction.
       The top of the lower triangle should coincide with the

       central point of the upper triangle.
 (ix) Trace the Hexagram of Earth in the South
       saying: "ARARITA."
           This Hexagram has the apex of the lower
       triangle pointing downwards, and it should be
       capable of inscription in a circle.

       "ARARITA."
           This hexagram is like that of Earth; but
       the bases of the triangles coincide, forming a
       diamond.

       saying: "ARARITA."
           This hexagram has the lower triangle
       placed above the upper, so that their apices
       coincide.

    The Banishing Ritual is identical, save that the direction of
the Hexagrams must be reversed.

                                        or zodiacal signs.
                                         The Hexagram of Earth alone
   2         1         1          2     is used. Draw the hexagram,
                                        beginning    from     the   point
           1              1             which is attributed to the
                                        planet you are dealing with.
                                        (See "777," col. lxxxiii.)
     2                           2       Thus to invoke Jupiter begin
     2                         2        from the right-hand point of the
                                        lower triangle, dextro-rotary,
                                        and complete; then trace the
           1              1             upper triangle from its left-
      4,9                      6,7
             5,8                        hand point and complete.
                      3,10
2,11                                2,11 Trace the astrological sigil of
                                        the planet in the centre of your
  6,7                             4,9   hexagram.
         3,10             5,8
             2                 1         For the Zodiac use the
                                        hexagram of the planet which
                                        rules the sign you require
   1                                    ("777," col. cxxxviii.); but draw
                           2
     1                                  the astrological sigil of the sign
                        2               instead of that of the planet.
                                         For Caput and Cauda Draconis
                                        use the lunar hexagram, with
          2                       1
                                        the sigil of < or >.
  1                                 1    To banish reverse the hexagram.

               2                         In all cases use a conjuration
                      2
                                        first with ARARITA, and next
                                        with the name of the God
corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.
     The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in [figure
above].

     2. These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn
appear in flame, in flame so near to physical flame that it would
perhaps be visible to the eyes of a bystander, were one present. It
is alleged that some persons have attained the power of actually
kindling fire by these means. Whether this be so or not, the
power is not one to be aimed at.
     3. Success in "banishing" is known by a "feeling of clean-
liness" in the atmosphere; success in "invoking" by a "feeling of
holiness." It is unfortunate that these terms are so vague.
     But at least make sure of this: that any imaginary figure or
being shall instantly obey the will of the student, when he uses the
appropriate figure. In obstinate cases, the form of the appropriate
God may be assumed.
     4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commence-
ment of any ceremony whatever. Next, the student should use a
general invocation, such as the "Preliminary Invocation" in the
"Goetia," as well as a special invocation to suit the nature of his
working.
     5. Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a matter,
and its grades so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good
sense of the student to decide whether or not he should be
satisfied with his result.

                                  V
     1. Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions,
having bathed and robed with the proper decorum. Let the Place
of Working be free from all disturbance, and let the preliminary
purifications, banishings and invocations be duly accomplished,
and, lastly, let the incense be kindled.
     2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the
proper magical garments and armed with the proper magical
weapons) as enveloping his physical body, or standing near to and
in front of him.

     3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that
imagined figure, so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with
its eyes, and hearing with its ears.
     This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.
     4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to
a great height above the earth.
     5. Let him then stop and look about him. (It is sometimes
difficult to open the eyes.)
     6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become
conscious of a landscape.
     Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered,
using the proper pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.
     7. Let him travel about at will, either with or without
guidance from such figure or figures.
     8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will
cause to appear the particular places he may with to visit.
     9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and
deceptions that he will experience, carefully testing the truth of all
with whom he speaks.
     Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory; the
appropriate pentagrams will in such a case cause him to shrivel or
decay.
     10. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in these
matters.
     11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body; but should
any difficulty arise, practice (again) will make the imagination
fertile. For example, one may create in thought a chariot of fire
with white horses, and command the charioteer to drive earth-
wards.
     It might be dangerous to go too far, or stay too long, for
fatigue must be avoided.
     The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or
loss of memory or other mental faculty.

     12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which
he supposes himself to have been travelling to coincide with the
physical, tightening his muscles, drawing in his breath, and
putting his forefinger to his lips. Then let him "awake" by a well-
defined act of will, and soberly and accurately record his
experiences.
     It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment
is perfectly easy to perform. It is best to learn by "travelling" with
a person already experienced in the matter. Two or three experi-
ments should suffice to render the student confident and even
expert. See also "The Seer", Equinox vol. I no. 2, pp. 295­333.

                                   VI

     1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few
results of importance. But it is susceptible of a development
which merges into a form of Dharana--concentration--and as
such may lead to the very highest ends. The principal use of the
practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the student with every
kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be
perfect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss
it, to transmute it, to cause it instantly to obey his will.
     2. Let him then begin exactly as before; but with the most
intense solemnity and determination.
     3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise
in a line exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point
where his physical body is situated (or, to put it more simply,
straight upwards).
     4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue
almost overcomes him. If he should find that he has stopped
without willing to do so, and that figure appear, let him at all costs
rise above them.
     Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his
way upward and onward!

      5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in
him. Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were
Typhon and all his hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against
him, though it were from the very Throne of God Himself that a
Voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let him struggle on,
ever on.
      6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being
is swallowed up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.* Let
him sink (when no longer can he strive, though his tongue be
bitten through with the effort and the blood gush from his
nostrils) into the blackness of unconsciousness; and then on
coming to himself, let him write down soberly and accurately a
record of all that hath occurred: yea, a record of all that hath
occurred.

   * This in case of failure. The results of success are so many and wonderful that no
effort is here made to describe them. They are classified, tentatively, in "The Herb
Dangerous," Part II, Equinox vol. I, no 2, pp. 31-89.
