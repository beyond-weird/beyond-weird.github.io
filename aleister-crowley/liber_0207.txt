            A SYLLABUS OF THE OFFICIAL

                  INSTRUCTIONS OF A.'.A.'.


                               HITHERTO PUBLISHED




THE publications of the A.'.A.'. divide themselves into four classes.

Class "A" consists of books of which may be changed not so much as the style of a letter:
that is, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the
Visible Head of the Organization.

Class "B" consists of books or essays which are the result of ordinary scholarship,
enlightened and earnest.

Class "C" consists of matter which is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anything
else.

Class "D" consists of the Official Rituals and Instructions.

Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class.

authentic.

The object of this course of reading is to familiarize the student with all that has been
said by the Great Masters in every time and country. He should make a critical
examination of them; not so much with the idea of discovering where truth lies, for he
cannot do this except by virtue of his own spiritual experience, but rather to discover the
essential harmony in those varied works. He should be on his guard against partisanship
with a favourite author. He should familiarize himself thoroughly with the method of
mental equilibrium, endeavouring to contradict any statement soever, although it may
be apparently axiomatic.

The general object of this course, besides that already stated, is to assure sound
education in occult matters, so that when spiritual illumination comes it may find a
well-built temple. Where the mind is strongly biased towards any special theory, the
result of an illumination is often to inflame that portion of the mind which is thus
overdeveloped, with the result that the aspirant, instead of becoming an Adept, becomes
a bigot and fanatic.

The A.'.A.'. does not offer examination in this course, but recommends these books as
the foundation of a library.

SECTION 2. --- Other books, principally fiction, of a generally suggestive and helpful
kind:

Zanoni, by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. Valuable for its facts and suggestions about
Mysticism.

suggestions about Magick.
