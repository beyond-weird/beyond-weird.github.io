    0. A, the heart of IAO, dwelleth in ecstasy in the secret
place of the thunders. Between Asar and Asi he abideth
in joy.
    1. The lightnings increased and the Lord Tahuti stood
forth. The Voice came from the Silence. Then the One ran
and returned.
    2. Now hath Nuit veiled herself, that she may open the
gate of her sister.
    3. The Virgin of God is enthroned upon an oyster-shell;
she is like a pearl, and seeketh Seventy to her Four. In her
heart is Hadit the invisible glory.
    4. Now     riseth  Ra-Hoor-Khuit,     and    dominion  is
established in the Star of the Flame.
    5. Also is the Star of the Flame exalted, bringing
benediction to the universe.
    6. Her then beneath the winged Eros is youth, delighting
in the one and the other.
    He is Asar between Asi and Nepthi; he cometh forth
from the veil.
    7. He rideth upon the chariot of eternity; the white and
the black are harnessed to his car. Therefore he reflecteth
the Fool, and the sevenfold veil is reveiled.
    8. Also cometh forth mother Earth with her lion, even
Sekhet, the lady of Asi.
    9. Also the Priest veiled himself, lest his glory be
profaned, lest his word be lost in the multitude.
                               2

    10. Now then the Father of all issued as a mighty wheel;
the Sphinx, and the dog-headed god, and Typhon, were
bound on his circumference.
    11. Also the lady Maat with her feather and her sword
abode to judge the righteous.
    For Fate was already established.
    12. Then the holy one appeared in the great water of the
North; as a golden dawn did he appear. bringing benediction
to the fallen universe.
    13. Also Asar was hidden in Amennti; and the Lords of
Time swept over him with the sickle of death.
    14. And a mighty angel appeared as a woman, pour-
ing vials of woe upon the flames, lighting the pure
stream with her brand of cursing. And the iniquity was
very great.
    15. Then the Lord Khem arose, He who is holy among
the highest, and set up his crowned staff for to redeem the
universe.
    16. He smote the towers of wailing; he brake them in
pieces in the fire of his anger, so that he alone did escape
from the ruin thereof.
    17. Transformed, the holy virgin appeared as a fluidic
fire, making her beauty into a thunderbolt.
    18. By her spells she invoked the Scarab, the Lord
Kheph-Ra, so that the waters were cloven and the illusion of
the powers was destroyed.
    19. Then the sun did appear unclouded, and the mouth of
Asi was on the mouth of Asar.
    20. Then also the Pyramid was builded so that the
Initiation might be complete.

  21. And in the heart of the Sphinx danced the Lord
Adonai, in His garlands of roses and pearls making glad the
concourse of things; yea, making glad the concourse of things.
