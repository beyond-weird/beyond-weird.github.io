  Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath, closing thy mouth with thy right forefinger
prest against thy lower lip. Then, dashing down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling
forcibly thy breath, cry:   .1

  With the same forefinger touch thy forehead and say ;2 thy member, and say  ;3 thy right
shoulder, and say ; thy left shoulder, and say ; then clasp thine hands, locking
the fingers, and cry .4


  Advance to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy forehead. Drawing the hands to the
eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus, and roar . Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-
paar-Kraat.5


  Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.


  Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.


  Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.6


  Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice in the Pæan, with these words
 7 with the signs of N.O.X.8

  Extend the arms in the form of a Tau, and say low but clear:     
   9   10  
             .11


  Repeat the Cross Qabalistic, as above, and end as thou didst begin.12

1"Away, every evil genius!" Lit., "from every evil genius"; scil. "far from every evil genius". (From the Greek Orthodox liturgy.)
2Hear the comments on the pronunciation of this word:
3Crowley's note: "The secret sense of these words is to be sought in the numeration thereof." One gematric identity is:
  = 1366 =  + ; but this is not noted in Crowley's Greek Qabalah.
4"Unto thee, O Phallus, be strength and benevolence. IAO!"
5This ritual was originally published in The Book of Lies, but was revised for Magick in Theory and Practice. In The Book of Lies,
this name was spelt "Hoor pa kraat". These two signs, of Horus and Hoor-paar-Kraat, may be found in The Equinox Vol. I
No. I, there titled "Blind Force" and "The Silent Watcher" respectively (https://www.the-equinox.org/vol1/no1/index.html).
6The Book of Lies has "roar  ... scream  ... say  ... bellow ".
7This is   in The Book of Lies. Both variations are valid.
8These are Puer (), Vir (), Puella, Mulier () and Mater Triumphans.  = N.O.X. = 210. See Liber V vel Reguli for
descriptions of the signs and Liber XXXVI: The Star Sapphire for their correct order.
9Not the ungrammatical , as in The Book of Lies.
10This is given as the meaningless   in the first edition of Magick in Theory and Practice, a misprint for  or
perhaps , "shines".
11"Before me the Iunges (lit., "ones that cry", from , "to cry [shout]"; hence an association with wrynecks, which were
used as charms by being bound on a revolving wheel), behind me the Teletarchai (the founders of the mysteries), on my right
hand the Synoches (the maintainers), on my left had the Daimons (Genii). About me flames the star of five, and in the column
stands the star of six." The Iunges, Teletarchai and Synoches are Chaldean in origin: see The Chaldæan Oracles of Zoroaster,
Westcott, vv.54-58 inc., available online at https://www.hermetic.com/texts/chaldean.html.
12Crowley makes some notes on this ritual in The Book of Lies, which are as follows: "25 is the square of 5, and the Pentagram
has the red colour of Geburah. The chapter is a new and more elaborate version of the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. It
would be improper to comment further upon an official ritual of the AA" The AA Syllabus states: "It is an improved
form of the `lesser' ritual of the Pentagram."
