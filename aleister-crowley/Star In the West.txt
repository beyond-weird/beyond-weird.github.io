"If you hold by anything in the world more than
by reason, truth, and justice; if your will be
uncertain and vacillating, either in good or evil; if
logic alarm you, or the naked truth make you
blush; if you are hurt when accepted errors are
assailed; condemn this work straight away; do
not read it; let it cease to exist for you; but at
the same time do not cry it down as dangerous."

AT first sight it may appear to the casual reader of this essay, that the
superscription on its cover is both froward and perverse, and contrary to the
sum of human experience. This however I trust he will find is not the case,
and, as Ianthe, will discover that after the mystic union has been
consummated, the beautiful daughter of Ligdus and Telethusa was as
acceptable a young husband as ever wooed nymph on the shaded slopes of
Ida.

Much has been written concerning stars, both terrestrial and celestial, and
not a little regarding that capricious star which gleamed over the humble
manger-bed of the Son of Man.

Dark seas of blood have long since lapped that star of the morning into the
crimson oblivion of day, whose empurpled strife has also rumbled into the
distance as the droning of some drowsy fire-finger on the sleeping
parchment of life, murmuring and moaning as the wind-kissed mouth of a
dreamy drum. Yet why should we still listen for those subtle sounds which
have wearily danced out their slow saraband of sorrow. Once Orphic they
arose emparadising the cavernous depths of Hell, to sink into a dirge-like
Niobe death-chaunt, bewailing the thirteen children of their begetting, rising
once more in the song of Ligeia, enticing men to her mire, and at length to
die still-voiced as the daughter of Dis, whose ghostly fingers sinking clutch
the frozen reeds of that slough in which she had so long wallowed.

Long have we peered, crouching on the watch-tower of our minds, through
the darkness of ignorance lit alone by the northern lights of folly, till our
_____________________________________________________________________________________
scorched eyes falling as slags upon our hearts, a light celestial hath arisen
from out the eyeless sockets of Eternity. A day-star, to flash forth into the
west, winged and wonderful. A Pharos of gleaming hope lighting our way
across the boisterous ocean of life to our haven of eternal rest.

The fools and the faulty, the wise and the wizened read and tremble before
the might of its majesty, for into its flaming horrent hath it woven and
braided the ashen locks of wisdom, the dyed curls of folly, and all the
glittering circlets of golden youth. All is transcended, all is unified and
transcendental; neither is there joy nor laughter, sorrow nor weeping, for all
is as a divine mastery of Truth and Knowledge to those who worship the
new-born God, like the Magi of the East, with gold, and frankincense, and
myrrh. Above whose heptagonal cradle flashes the magic star Lusanaher,
that great star Cor Leonis, which heralds and directs our reverent pilgrimage.

The Star has arisen; let us like men drop the silly pretence of an ostrich-like
self-delusion that the cindery asteroid still lights our way; let us rather apply
our mental spectroscope to the analysis of its rays. There shall we perchance
discover the blending of all opposites in one harmonious light; thence shall
we travel to the holy and humble house of the heart, wherein our God is
born, whose name is ineffable, a Crown of Glory, exalted forever above the
Balance of Righteousness and Truth.

As author of the following essay to you my readers, I can but say with the
four beasts of the Apocalypse: "Come and See."

"Behold the Lion... hath prevailed to open the Book and to loose the seven
seals thereof." For until now "No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under
the earth, was able to open the Book, neither to look thereon." Yet through
the astrolabe of his mind and in the alembic of his heart Aleister Crowley
has opened the book, breaking not only the first six seals, but the seventh
also. For those who read and understand, the heavens shall depart as a scroll,
and the stars shall fall, and the mountains be moved out of their places; and
they shall become as kings in a new kingdom, and be crowned with that
Crown which passes Understanding.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
I have attempted in the following seven chapters to interpret the Book of the
Seven Seals, and to paint its splendour, as an artist would incarnadine his
canvas with the red blood of his mistress, love-kissed from the bloom of her
crimson lips. I have not, as Samuel, hacked and hewn Agag into pieces
before the Lord in Gilgal; but rather Elijah-like have called upon Wisdom
and Understanding so that my sacrifice, and even the wood and stone of the
altar, and the water which floweth about it, may be licked up by the fire of
the great Coronation.

As another Ariadne I here offer this work to my readers as a twisted clue of
silk and hemp to guide them safely through the labyrinthine mysteries of
poetry and magic, whose taurine crags hug the blue sky, amorous as the
kisses of Pasiphae; across the Elysian fields of myrtle and asphodel, up the
eagle-crested slopes of Olympus, and over the shining sun-scorched sands of
Ammon, tawny and silken as the crouching form of some colossal lion, to
the cool groves of Eleusis child-like dreaming in the bosom of silvery Attica
by the blue Ægean sea.

Yet those who would drink deeper of the wine of this magical Eucharist,
spilt with due reverence on the pages of this volume, they must seek it in the
Sibylline verses of those books from which this one has drawn its life-blood.
And they are:

The Tale of Archais.
Songs of the Spirit.
Jezebel.
An Appeal to the American People.
Jephthah.
The Mother's Tragedy.
The Soul of Osiris.

By which, if they have eyes to perceive, they will become sacramental and
holy, through the fire-baptism of a new birth, and will hold the key of all
mysteries locked in the esoteric sign of the Sabbatic Goat, the Baphomet of
Mendes, the signatures of Solve and Coagula -- "The Everlasting Yea and
Nay."

My faults are more numerous than I care to think of; yet it is without fear or
trepidation that I offer this essay to the public. It has been a difficult task. In
simple words and complex symbols Crowley has written with St. Leo--
"Know, O man, thy dignity;" and this I have in this essay attempted to
explain, though many I am afraid will misunderstand me, and more still
misinterpret my modest efforts. For these latter ones I can but exclaim:

"Caeterum scis quid ego cogitem, scortum scorteum; Di tibi dent, nudosque
lares inopemque senectam et longas hyemes perpetuam que sitim."

And for those former, bid them contemplate well the words of St. Augustine:

"Such as the love of man is, such is he himself. Dost thou love the earth?
Thou art earth. Dost thou love God? What shall I say? Thou art God."

                              FOREWORD


IN "Frazer's Magazine" of November, 1866, may be found the following:

"Wherever there is any kind of true genius, we have no right to drive it mad
by ridicule or invective; we must deal with it wisely, justly, fairly. Some of
these passages which have been selected as evidence of (the poet's) plain
speaking, have been wantonly misunderstood. The volume, as a whole, is
neither profane nor indecent. A little more clothing in our uncertain climate
might perhaps have been attended with advantage... To us this volume, for
the first time, conclusively settles that Mr.-- is not a mere brilliant
rhetorician or melodious twanger of another man's lyre, but authentically a
poet."

So writes the critic. The name I have omitted is that of the last of the great
Victorian poets, Algernon Charles Swinburne. In the dying glory of this last
great singer of the nineteenth century, the deepening twilight shows but few
rising stars; alone perhaps amid the younger generation of poets ­ alas, how
many and yet how few ­ Aleister Crowley stands forth with no little of the
glory of the great Victorian cast o'er him; enhancing our pleasures, and
enchanting our senses. The Sun kisses the Moon, and through the
diaphanous veil of the vestal is seen the subtle contour of her form. But no
vestal is Crowley, no mere milk-and-bun-walk, where we may rest and take
our fill; for he has unstrung the mystic lyre of life from the tree of the
Knowledge of Good and of Evil, singing old songs and new, flinging shrill
notes of satire to this tumultuous world, as some stormy petrel shrilly crying
to the storm; or sweet notes of love, soft as the whispering wings of a
butterfly.

Here are the jewels of Heaven, of Havilah, and of Eden, with not a little of
the fire of Hell, the flames of Gehenna, and the darkness of Dûat. If we look
for pyramids and colossi disappointment will be our lot; we cannot hold, as
Hanuman of Ind, a mountain in one hand and a forest in the other, neither
can we gaze on a celestial Meru or Olympus; but as we look, and here it is
only the searcher who is rewarded, we find a little jewel, then another, and
still another, till, as we grasp them, their very light is caught by their
_____________________________________________________________________________________
unfound fellows, and our path is lit as a fairy dell by a thousand wonders of
light and of beauty.

"A little more clothing," the critic writes, as he perused the "Poems and
Ballads," perhaps, yet we do not feel its need in the glowing works before
us. Forty long years have passed, and the world moves. Crowley fairly puts
his characters to bed, tucks them up, and does not blow the candle out with
cryptic Morse-like dot and dash, leaving the imagination to wallow in the
dark, intelligible to the baby-mind of sucklings, and we admire him all the
more for not doing so; his undraped virginity is delightful, and if his
maidens lack vestments and his matrons mantles, it is a hearty sight, a robust
sight, it flushes the drains of our mind, and discloses a heart lying beneath
all the conventional tweeds and silks of our sleek respectability. The stale
odour of Mrs. Grundy's petticoats vanishes, neither is it replaced by the
patchouli of Thais, nor the musk of Aspasia; and if the aroma of a little
human sweat does salute our nostrils, it is at least a healthy human smell ­
an odour of sanctity ­ infinitely preferable to all the ancient pot-pourri of
Philistia, that young and old ladies are alike so fond of distributing among
their pretty speeches, as well as their pretty garments.

"Is life, then, to resolve itself for us into a chain of exhilarating pangs?"
asked Pallas, in Mr. Gosse's "Hypolympia," in answer to the query of
Æsculapius, "What is pleasure?" We see the mortal form of the immortal
healer climbing along the jutting cornice of some cliff, in search for the
simples of life; and as the zephyrs waft his long ashen locks around his
furrowed brow, his trembling hand clutches some rugged crag, more perhaps
from joy than fear. And so, as we now open the works of Aleister Crowley,
we are filled with an exhilarating chain of pangs; mortal-like we are never
sated, and as our lips taste the nectar of true poetry we tremblingly clutch the
crags of Parnassus in search for the Asphodel of Love, Wisdom, and Beauty.
Here, as we turn some beetling height, the dying rays of the Swinburnian sun
sink, those rays that ruffled the vestal purity of the clouds to the rosy blush
of a lover's kiss, and in the departing light we again find the mystic Trinity
midst the hellebore and thistles of existence, enthroned, eternal. The sun
sinks, and the last notes of the nightingale die into the stillness of falling
night. The emerald sky like the robe of some car-borne Astarté, slashed with
an infinite orange and red, fades into the sombre garment of night; and
above silently breaks a primal sea gemmed with all the colours of the opal,
deepening into a limitless amethyst, darkens, and the sun goes out. The
spangled pall of Night is drawn, and the lull of death is o'er us; but no, hark!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the distant boom of a beetle is carried across the still glowing welkin, it is
the signal drum announcing the marriage of Night and Day. The crescent
moon rises, diaphanous and fair, and the world wakes to a chant:

                                  DIONYSUS

             I bring ye wine from above,
                     From the vats of the storied sun;
             For every one of ye love,
                     And life for every one.
             Ye shall dance on hill and level;
                     Ye shall sing in hollows and height
             In the festal mystical revel,
                     The rapturous Bacchanal rite!
             The rocks and trees are yours,
                     And the waters under the hill,
             By the might of that which endures,
                     The holy heaven of will!
             I kindle a flame like a torrent
                     To rush from star to star;
             Your hair as a comet's horrent,
                     Ye shall see things as they are!
             I lift the mask of matter;
                     I open the heart of man;
             For I am of force to shatter
                     The cast that hideth ­ Pan!
             Your loves shall lap up slaughter,
                     And dabbled with roses of blood
             Each desperate darling daughter
                     Shall swim in the fervid flood.
             I bring ye laughter and tears,
                     The kisses that foam and bleed,
             The joys of a million years,
                     The flowers that bear no seed.
             My life is bitter and sterile,
                     Its flame is a wandering star.
             Ye shall pass in pleasure and peril
                     Across the mystical bar
             That is set for wrath and weeping
                     Against the children of earth;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              But ye in singing and sleeping
                       Shall pass in measure and mirth!
              I lift my wand and wave you
                       Through hill to hill of delight;
              My rosy rivers lave you
                       In innermost lustral light.
              I lead you, lord of the maze,
                       In the darkness free of the sun;
              In spite of the spite that is day's,
                       We are wed, we are wild, we are one!*

               The Chapter known as

             The Looking-Glass

In which chapter it is related how it surpasseth in
brilliance all other glasses in which we see darkly,
and how by it we see face to face; and of its divers
reflections, and of the brightness and perfection of
     its surface, and the whiteness of the silver
       of which it is moulded; for it was cast
        from the crucible of many mysteries,
            and fashioned by the cunning
             hand of a master who will
                  endure to the end.

                          The Looking-Glass


ON surveying the works of Aleister Crowley the two essential facts that grip
our understanding are: firstly, the superabundance of his genius; and
secondly, the diversity of his form. "My womb is pregnant with mad moons
and suns,"* he writes, and though we could hardly agree to endow so virile a
master with so feminine an organ, yet we can attribute something very like it
to his brain. Pregnant it certainly is, and more, being already the mother of a
large family, a family as diverse as the offspring of Uranus, father of the
Gods, born to him by Earth, earthy and celestial. Sweet lyrics are crushed
cheek by jowl with the most corrosive satire, sonorous heroics and blank
verse at times merge into the most raucous of Hudibrasian doggerel, rimes of
the sweetest and the most perverse character ring in our astonished ear,
tragedy and farce, ever extremes: Paul and Virginie sitting on the knees of
Pantagruel, blowing kisses through the Sephirotic circle of eternity. At times
we listen to the yearning hopes of a Paracelsus, or the noble words of a
Tannhäuser; at times warm arms are flung around us, and the hot kisses of
some Messaline suffocate our very breath, leading us into the mansions of a
de Sade and through the gardens of an Aretino, horrid with the frenzy of
Eros. Or, again, we are treading with the sages of philosophy, or `midst the
stars in search of the Psyche of events; dreams almost monstrous in their
intensity seize our troubled brain, deep problems of psychology, of sex, of
the carnal, of the pathic, and of evil, all inter-webbed and woven with the
eternal filament of good. And so if we read this strange poet aright, we shall
see as we progress onwards, that he has struck a sonorous note from the rim
of Time, fulfilled of the knowledge of good and evil, sweet to the ears of
those who are born children by the daughters of men to the sons of God,
sweet as that mystic fruit was to the lips of Eve, daughter of God, child of
the mystic Man. But we must speed on, taking in this chapter swift glances
at the magnificent scenery that these volumes offer up to us, plucking the
lilies of spring and the roses of summer, and weave them into a laureate
wreath with the fiery leaves of the dying year.

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 166.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Poe, in that little masterpiece of his, "The Poetic Principle," lays down that
the value of a poem lies in the ratio of its elevating excitement, the
excitement being the power it has in elevating the soul. And here we think,
were Poe still living, he would have found no small part of his ideal realized.
By soul we naturally do not mean a haloed fowl strumming dithyrambs on a
harp, or the mere döppelganger of the living; but that inner power of good
and evil which lies latent in self, controlled by that intuitive consciousness
within us, and manifested in our appetites and desires; this intangible soul
aspiring upwards is called Virtue, sinking downwards Vice; finding infinity
in the conceptions of nether and upper, heaven and hell, paradise and
gehenna; and finality on earth ­ its sporting ground. Further Poe states: that
an epic was of itself a nullity, and that a poem of great length, commencing
as it might in exaltation, ended in nine cases out of ten in somnolence.
Poetry must stimulate, it must irritate the soul in some definite manner, or
else it ceases to be poetry. For when once poetry exerts a soporific power its
whole object is lost, and, as a flash of lightning, it must he vivid, bright,
flaming for a moment, awful, eloquent, rushing from the darkness of night
through the flashing elements of day into the silence of eternity.

And this is exactly the poetry we here find. No poems are of any great
length, no poems here contain a labour on the part of the reader to attain the
end,* though in some places the labours of Hercules seem insignificant
compared with the labours of mental unknotting, but even in such places
(where the sense becomes tangled in the reader's mind)' he loses none of the
beauty of rime and rhythm, he never becomes bored, never weary. Set in the
pure gold of verse and line, lie lyrics of surpassing beauty: Tannhäuser (the
longest of the poems) would be a magnificent contemplation even if we cut
from it its sparkling songs, but with them it becomes superb, neither are
there too many; the queen of our poet's ideals is no gilded prostitute, no
Theodora hung with a myriad flashing jewels, but rather some chaste
priestess carrying on her breast the mystic symbol of Isis, whose belt is a
jewelled Zodiac, and in whose hand is the eternal Ankh.

*Except perhaps in Orpheus.

This interspersing of lyrics has been carried to a charming intensity of
expression and their effect on the mind is one full of joy, no cloying, no
surfeit, no repletion; the variety of the dishes is extraordinary in delicacy and
piquancy as well as in number.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The morals of a nation can with fair accuracy be gauged from the condition
of its arts and literature, and in what a state are ours? Our music the jangling
ditties of the streets, our paintings, posters and bedizened Jewesses; and our
literature, heroically vulgar, vulgarly obscene, and obscenely insipid.

Morals, the nation has none, merely a better art in disguising than in former
times, that is all. We no longer can produce a Swift, a Congreve, or a
Dryden, a Smollett, a Lever, or a Sterne, and yet our writers are legion ­ and
as feculent as the flabby prostitutes of the street. The facetiae of the fifteenth
century, "Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles," "The Decameron," "The
Heptameron," "The Nights of Straparola," "Brantôme," etc., etc., are not
only masterpieces for all time, but are pure, even chaste, compared with the
virginal lusts that are becoming so fashionable in our modern literature,
whose maidens are Lesbians, and whose heroes are satyrs. Europa is no
longer satisfied with her bull, but seeks an ichor-maddened elephant; Leda
disdains her swan, and burns for a straddling ostrich; the goat of lechery sits
enthroned o'er us, and is fast coupling with the mind of the nation, and
spawning offspring effeminate, lustful, and degenerate. Tribades with their
evil-smelling kisses swarm over our pages, heroines are no longer satisfied
with mere men, but must strain to their breasts legless monsters; whilst a
hero will listen to his loved one snorting in the arms of some lusty Pthn.
Such literature is revolting, not in its mere descriptions, for these are nothing
to the student, being generally but poorly described realities, but they are
horrible when strewn broadcast among the children of the nation. We still
have our Bible and need no more erotica. Filth has been defined as matter
out of place, and so is this pathic literature, relegated to the realms of sexual
psychology in the works of an Ellis or an Ebing is one thing, yet the
government of this nation cannot stomach them thus, and seizes, expels, and
burns; but if these horrid sores of the human soul are cut out and plastered
on the pages of the fickle fiction of the day, then are they passed in seductive
covers as proper nourishment for the nation; and devoured with relish and
avidity. One minute, impatient reader, for I hear you mutter: "Are not these
very aberrations set forth with no mean lustre on the pages of the works of
Aleister Crowley?" Listen. Have any of Crowley's works been printed
pueris virginibusque? Are they intended for the gaping public? Are they
devoured by mental babes and sucklings, or worse, forcibly crammed down
their throats in simple or other forms? I think not. To some it may seem
curious that these poems are published by a society called "The Society for
the Propagation of Religious Truth." By whom is the Bible published? Is it
not also a religious society, and is the Bible immaculate? Was it not Sir
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Richard Burton, the greatest of Orientalists, who resolved in case the rabid
pornophobic suggestions of certain ornaments of the home press were acted
upon, to appear in court with the Bible and Shakespeare under one arm, and
Petronius Arbiter and Rabelais under the other? And I remember a certain
sentence ­ characteristic of the man ­ he was describing those people who
are unable to read crude texts, arid needs must have them bowdlerized and
expurgated, lest they fall into a priapic frenzy: "The man must be prurient
and lecherous as a dog-faced baboon in rut to have aught of passion excited
by either."

This is all true enough; but I must call a halt. I had not intended here to write
a series of apologetics, for I leave that to the poet and his pen, who can well
look after themselves; but what I wished to point out was the deplorable
state into which our literature has fallen. Its ever increasing demand for
sensation has been its destruction; everyone now is a mental Trimalchio
whose appetite has to be awakened by the most piquant and fantastic of
dishes. Scott, Dickens, and Thackeray are still (I believe) read by an ever
decreasing number of school-girls; Flaubert, Gautier and Balzac ­ who
would have shocked the youthful years of our parents ­ have become dull
and tedious; a few cranks praise Tourgenief, Tolstoi and Gorky, whilst one
out of every hundred thousand may know that there was such a man as
Dostoieffsky. And poetry, O greatest of the Muses, thy fate is truly a sad
one! Much verse is produced which might be placed with last year's store
lists ­ you know where; some is distinctly good, but it is soon lost in the
raging sea of poetic dialect, and hackneyed naïveté. Here and there we come
across a charming lyric, which the carping whisky-and-water critic will at
once demolish as weak, troubled, vague, etc., etc. Not long ago my eyes lit
on the following which I considered a charming verse from a poetic point of
view, if not from that of a morbid anatomist:

              Look down into the river. Can you see
                    The mingled images the water shows?
              So lies my soul in yours. As close as lie
                    The folded petals in an unblown rose.

Yet the little thing who "stinks and stings" was not satisfied, the second
metaphor actually weakened the effect of the first, etc., etc. With such have
poets to contend, but I do not think such homunculi worry Aleister Crowley
much. His poetry is his own, and he gives it us as it is written without
_____________________________________________________________________________________
respect of persons or opinions, for his masters have been the greatest of our
race.

In these poems we find a certain preponderance of Swinburne, Blake,
Browning, Keats, Shelley, and Rossetti. In the dedication to "Jephthah,"
which is addressed to Algernon Charles Swinburne, we read the following:

              As streams get water of the sun-smit sea,
              Seeking my ocean and my sun in thee.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66.

And this discipleship to the greatest and last of the Victorian poets has given
us many a subtle and enthralling line. The scene when Charicles wakes and
catches Archais to his breast is worthy of the bard who sang of "Tristram
and Iseult." It is as follows:

              He sprang, he caught her to his breast; the maid
              Smiled and lay back to look at him. He laid
              Her tender body on the sloping field,
              And felt her sighs in his embraces yield
              A sweeter music than all birds. But she,
              Lost in the love she might not know, may see
              No further than his face, and yet, aware
              Of her own fate, resisted like a snare.
              Her own soft wishes. As she looked and saw
              His eager face, the iron rod of law
              Grew like a misty pillar in the sky.
              In all her veins the blood's desires die,
              And then ­ O sudden ardour! ­ all her mind
              And memory faded, and looked outward, blind,
              Beyond their bitterness. Her arms she flung
              Around him, and with amorous lips and tongue
              Tortured his palate with extreme desire,
              And like a Mænad maddened; equal fire
              Leapt in his veins; locked close for love they lie,
              The heart's dumb word exprest without a sigh
              In the strong magic of a lover's kiss.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 11.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
These superb lines, like those of Swinburne, are in reality a series of brilliant
lyrical illustrations depicting the story in measures of divine song. More we
find in this same poem, and in others also; the following fine sonnet entitled
"The Summit of the Amorous Mountain," is distinctly Swinburnian; I give it
in its entirety:

              To love you, Love, is all my happiness;
                     To kill you with my kisses; to devour
                     Your whole ripe beauty in the perfect hour
              That mingles us in one supreme caress;
              To drink the purple of your thighs; to press
                     Your beating bosom like a living flower;
                     To die in your embraces, in the shower
              That dews like death your swooning loveliness.

              To know you love me; that your body leaps
                     With the quick passion of your soul; to know
                     Your fragrant kisses sting my spirit so;
              To be one soul where Satan smiles and sleeps--
                     Ah! in the very triumph-hour of Hell
                     Satan himself remembers whence he fell!*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 181.

Again, such lines as these from the "Triumph of Man":

              And all the earth is blasted; the green sward
              Burns where it touches, and the barren sod
              Rejects the poison of the blood of God.
              .   .   .   .   .    .     .    .   .   . . . .
              To tread base thoughts as our high thoughts have trod,
              Deep in the dust, the carrion that was God;*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 106, 107.

remind us strongly of such pieces as "Before a Crucifix," whilst others take
us into the mystic and simple land of Blake, such as the duet of Charicles
and Archais:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Hush! the music swells apace,
                     Rolls its silver billows up
             Through the void demesne of space
                     To the heavens' azure cup!
             Hush, my love, and sleep shall sigh
                     This is immortality!*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 27.

Other lines again hold us enthralled with the extraordinary power they
contain, expressed in a single word. Thus in the poem "The Lesbian Hell,"
we find ourselves in the unutterable void of Orcus, where kisses are flung in
vain, and where around us pale women fleet:

             Whose empty fruitlessness assails the night
                     With hollow repercussion, like dim tombs
                     Wherein some vampire glooms.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 185.

This last line is one of the most expressive ever written by Crowley, and in
the last word "glooms" is concentrated more than terror or fear, a brooding
unnameable horror, comparable to the word "crowd" that Blake makes use
of in his "Mad Song":

             Like a fiend in a cloud.
                     With howling woe
             After night I do crowd
                     And with night will go.

Both poets have chosen here not the only word that could be chosen, but the
only word that would in the above poems express the maximum amount, of
horror in the one case; and of desire in the other.

Very different from Blake do we find such a poem as "Vespers," which,
though differing in rime, in cadence and spirit; is reminiscent of Rossetti's
"Blessed Damozel":

             Still in those avenues of light,
                     No maid, with golden zone,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              And lily garment that from sight
                       Half hides the ivory throne,
              Lay in my arms the livelong night
                       To call my soul her own.*

* Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 53.

Whilst parts of the poem "Messaline" with which "Alice" opens remind us
of poor "Jenny."

Tennyson, if we are to judge from the introduction to "Alice," does not seem
to hold a very high position in the opinion of Aleister Crowley. "He is a
neurasthenic counter-jumper" certainly would not have pleased Poe, who
regarded him as the noblest poet that ever lived. Nevertheless we find traces
of the great laureate's work in these poems, such as the idea contained in the
following verse of "De Profundis":

              I have dreamed life a circle or a line,
              Called God, and Fate, and Chance, and Man, divine.
                       I know not all I say, but through it all
              Mark the dim hint of ultimate sunshine!*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 113.

which is almost identical with that in Canto LIV of "In Memoriam." A poem
written in the metre of Tennyson's most famous work, yet differing in
cadence, is "The Blood Lotus."

      Quaint carven vampire bats, unseen in curious hollows of the
              trees,
      Or deadlier serpents coiled at ease round carcases of birds
              unclean;

      All wandering changeful spectre shapes that dance in slow
              sweet measure round
      And merge themselves in the profound, nude women and
              distorted apes

      Grotesque and hairy, in their rage more rampant than the
              stallion steed;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
       There is no help: their horrid need on these pale women they
               assuage.*

*Oracles, vol. ii, p. 13.

Another poem that in parts reminds us of the "In Memoriam" is "The
Nameless Quest," such lines as:

                                                 I was wed
               Unto the part, and could not grasp the whole.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.

breathe a great and similar doubt. As in many respects the agnosticism of
Tennyson's "In Memoriam" resembles the atheistic free thought of
FitzGerald's "Omar Khayyám," so do both the above-mentioned poems, and
the first is of similar metre, its quatrains containing, as those of the poet of
Khorassán, flights of great power of thought; the following five quatrains are
well worth quoting:

               We weep them as they slip away; we gaze
               Back on the likeness of the former days--
                        The hair we fondle and the lips we kiss--
               Roses grow yellow and no purple stays.
               .     .   .   .  .   .   .   .  .   .  .   .   .
               Why not with time? To-morrow we may see
               The circle ended ­ if to-morrow be--
                        And gaze on chaos, and a week bring back
               Adam and Eve beneath the apple tree.
               .     .   .   .  .   .   .   .  .   .  .   .   .
               Join'st thou thy feeble hands in foolish prayer
               To him thy brain hath moulded and set there
                        In thy brain's heaven? Such a god replies
               As thy fears move, So men pray everywhere.
               .     .   .   .  .   .   .   .  .   .  .   .   .
               God did first work in earth when womankind
                        He chipped from Adam's rib ­ a thankless task
               I wot His wisdom has long since repined.
               .     .   .   .  .   .   .   .  .   .  .   .   .
               When I am dead remember me for this
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               That I bade workers work, and lovers kiss;
                       Laughed with the Stoic at the dream of pain,
               And preached with Jesus the evangel­bliss.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 109-112. (The metre though not the cadence
is that of "Laus Veneris.")

Whilst such lines as the following in the second poem also remind us of the
astronomer poet:

               O thou, zelator of this Paradise,
               Tell thou the secret of' the pillar! None
               Can hear thee, of the souls beneath the sun.
               Speak! or the very Godhead in thee dies.
               For we are many, and thy name is One.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.

Before we leave the glowing east, one more curious similarity still strikes us,
it is that though in so many ways the ideas of Aleister Crowley are akin to
those of Omar Khayyám, yet his fertile imagination also engenders flights as
spiritual as those contained in the melodious ghazals of Jeláladdín. In more
than one place we come across lines similar to these in Tannhäuser:

               I say, then, "I;" and yet it is not "I"
               Distinct, but "I" incorporate in All.
               I am the Resurrection and the Life!
               The work is finished, and the Night rolled back!
               I am the rising Sun of Life and Light,
               The Glory of the Shining of the Dawn!
               I am Osiris! I the Lord of Life
               Triumphant over death--
               O Sorrow, Sorrow, Sorrow of the World!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.

That such similarities as we have pointed out above show Aleister Crowley
to be a copyist, must be far from the minds of all his readers. Youth most
certainly tends towards certain ideals, and frequently results in a definite
hero-worship; but genius cannot be bound for long; it will eventually find its
_____________________________________________________________________________________
own level. The mere fact that certain forms of thought and modes of
expression occur here as they have occurred elsewhere, should he as a
literary barometer, enabling us to judge the mental standard of the writer. All
great writers will have many points in common. It is more than probable that
Aleister Crowley had already read most of Shakespeare before he wrote
"The Mother's Tragedy," and yet, because of this we should not necessarily
say that the following magnificent lines were due to the influence of the
great master, notwithstanding the fact that they are in many respects equal to
much of his best:

              Your breath, that burns upon me, wraps me round
              With whirling passion, pierces through my veins
              With its unhallowed fire, constrains, compels,
              Drags out the corpse of twenty years ago
              From the untrusty coffin of my mind,
              To poison, to corrupt, to strike you there
              Blind with its horror.*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 160.

Many other pieces are almost equally grand, the last speech of Tannhäuser to
Heinrich is truly magnificent:

                                                   And verily
              My life was borne on the dark stream of death
              Down whirling aeons, linked abysses, columns
              Built of essential time...*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.

In "The Violet's Love Story,"*1. or in "Dora,"*2. we have as simple a poem
as could be written, and in one of the verses of a chorus in "Jephthah,"
beginning "There flashes the heart of a rose,"*3. one of the most mystical.
Here is a furious inspiration in blank verse (the prophet in "Jephthah"
speaks):

*1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 38.
*2. Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs, vol. iii, p. 59.
*3. Jephthah, vol. i, p. 77.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                                           Ha!
              The rose has washed its petals, and the blood
              Pours through its burning centre from my heart.
              The fire consumes the light; the rosy flame
              Leaps through the veins of blue, and tinges them
              With such a purple as incarnadines
              The western sky when storms are amorous
              And lie upon the breast of toiling ocean,
              Such billows to beget as earth devours
              in ravening whirlpool gulphs. My veins are full,
              Throbbing with fire more potent than all wine,
              All sting of fleshly pangs and pleasures. Oh!
              The god is fast upon my back; he rides
              My spirit like a stallion; for I hate
              The awful thong his hand is heavy with.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 67.

Again, in "The Nameless Quest":

                            Then surged the maddening tide
              Of my intention. Onward! Let me run!
              Thy steed, O Moon! Thy chariot, O Sun!
              Lend me fierce feet, winged sandals, wings as wide
              As thine, O East wind! And the goal is won!*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.

Little, if any, poetry of a truly epic nature can we find; the nearest is the
song of Tannhäuser, somewhat of a prophecy, somewhat of an anthem:

              I rose within the elemental ball,
              And lo! the Ancient One of Days did sit!
              His head and hair were white as wool. His eyes
              A flaming fire: and from the splendid mouth
              Flashed the Eternal Sword!
              Lo! Lying at his feet as dead, I saw
              The leaping-forth of Law:
              Division of the North wind and the South,
              The lightning of the armies of the Lord;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              East rolled asunder from the rended West;
              Height clove the depth; the Voice begotten said:
              "Divided be thy ways and limited!"
              Answered the reflux and the indrawn breath:
              "Let there be Life, and Death!"*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 252.

Worthy of the author of "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell!"

"Let there be Life and Death," and the link between these two is Love. Here
we will give but one or two curious examples, dealing with the great songs
of love in the next chapter. As a singer of love-songs Aleister Crowley
excels. The following is from "The Star and the Garter":

              Your lips are gathered up to mine;
              Your bosom heaves with fearful breath;
              Your scent is keen as floral wine,
              Inviting me, and love, to death.*

*The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 11.

Also the following is charming in its simplicity:

              She has a lithe white body, slim
              And limber, fairy-like, a snake
              Hissing some Babylonian hymn
              Tangled in the Assyrian brake.*

*The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 10.

A curious Swinburnian strain of passion is found wedged in the satiric lines
of "Why Jesus Wept." Percy, the youth flatulent with love, chants to his
Angela ­ society ­ thus:

                                              To me she is
              The rosy incarnation of a kiss,
              The royal rapture of a young delight,
              The mazy music of virginity,
              Sun of the day, moon of the night,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              All, all to me!*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 39.

And again:

              Love, love, these raptures are like springtide rain
              Nestling among green leaves.*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40.

One more example of the diversity of Crowley's pen, before we deal with
his place in the history of poetry. In the "God-Eater" we come across a most
weird form of poetic imagination in the chants of Rupha ­ the hag of
Eternity:

              Crafty! Crafty!
              That is the omen.
              Fear not the foemen!                    [She rises up.
              Mine is the spoil
              Of the grimly toil.
              Gloomy, gloomy!
              Ah! but I laugh.
              He is but a fool.
              He has lost!
              He is lost!
              Take the staff!
              Trace the rule
              Of the circle crossed!*

*The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 135.

We have now seen, more or less, some of the chief influences which have
exerted their sway over our poet's mind; and I think we have shown him to
be a worthy pupil of the great masters we have had occasion to name. Now
that I have pointed out these certain influences, illustrating them by means of
a few quotations, I intend to enter more into the history of his poetry and
also the place it fills in the history of English poetry generally. This is not
altogether an easy matter. Firstly, in selecting distinctive specimens it is
difficult not to help being guided by individual taste; secondly, the labour of
_____________________________________________________________________________________
sorting the finest out of the fine is a work which needs no small powers of
application; and thirdly, how often may not the individual selector be wrong
in his choice? But this latter difficulty is easily overcome by the reader, who
has only to pick and choose for himself; the work of an appreciative essayist
being merely that of producing a characteristic display of what he considers
the most attractive wares. It is not intended here in any way to assume
immaculacy for our author, far from it, for faults are to be found here as in
every other work, great or small, false rime and metre, half a step left out
here and there, sometimes a whole one: but taking these poems as a whole,
these lapses are remarkably few, and it must also be borne in mind that in
nearly every case they are intentional lapses from the orthodox rules of
poetic cadence and metre. One command Crowley alone obeys, and that is:
that all verse ­ rime, rhythm, and metre ­ to be considered as poetry, must
be musical.* Without music there can be no poetry, at best but a kind of
poetic prose as found in the Prophetic Books of Blake, and in the works of
Walt Whitman. Yet in Blake, I think, we do find many consistent
irregularities, which have been entirely misunderstood by many of his
editors and critics. However, it was not till Swinburne loomed athwart the
conscious regularity of the Tennysonian era, a poetic pre-Raphaelite, that,
strictly speaking, a conscious and musical irregularity became admissible,
wedging its way in, and splitting up the metrical structure of perfect
scansion.

*As a good example I will quote the following opening lines of a sonnet addressed to
"the Secretary of State," by Wilson Bonchord in Poems composed in Prison:
               When Crime's sad victim has been tried and brought
                      Within the circle of the difficult sphere
                      Which England's penal statutes appoint him here:
               To expiate by patient toil and thought.
Neither the second nor the third line scans; nevertheless the second is good, as it is
musical: the extra half-step in the word "difficult" carrying with it a difficulty, and thus
emphasizing the meaning; whilst in the third, there is neither scansion nor music.

In "Atalanta in Calydon" we find a further breaking away from the dramatic
formalities inaugurated during the post-restoration era: Swinburne seeking a
more perfect model in the old Tragedies of Greece. This had already been
partially carried out by Keats, who definitely broke away from the Miltonic
style of Wordsworth and Coleridge, and was more than half completed by
his contemporary, Shelley. But it was not till Swinburne himself seized the
finely-strung lyre of the unconsciously irregular author of "Prometheus,"
and attuned it to the rustle of Blake's angel-winged voice, that it can be said
_____________________________________________________________________________________
that a certain system of irregularities in metre became admissible in the
formal court of poetry.

As the Rossetti brotherhood of painters returned to the stiff and simple
elegance as displayed in the "Primavera" of Botticelli, so did Swinburne go
back to the simple beauty of Greek tragedy as depicted in Euripides.*
Crowley does the same, as we see in "The Tale of Archais," also in "The
Mother's Tragedy" and "The Fatal Force"; but in these two latter dramas
with this important difference, that instead of applying Greek style to Greek
scenery, he applies it to a totally different end, namely to the expression of
modern surroundings, or to his own intrinsic ideas, as in the last-named play,
which, even more so than in "The Mother's Tragedy" is, as we shall see later
on, a subtle discount on present-day morality.

*Rather than Sophocles or Aeschylus.

What Beardsley and Whistler did for art, Crowley is now doing for poetry.
Beardsley, especially, succeeded Rossetti just as Crowley is now
superseding Swinburne. A poetic iconoclast to the very backbone, we find
Crowley, especially in his later works, breaking away from every poetic
convention and restraint. At first it makes itself apparent in "The Star and
the Garter," which was unwound from that same tangled skein from out of
which Browning had ravelled "Fifine," and then, in the full power of
manhood, in "Why Jesus Wept"; which one day will find its historic niche in
the temple of Poetry, somewhere between the "Hudibras" of Butler and the
"Endymion" of Keats.

Though Crowley, as can be clearly seen throughout his works, is not only a
great admirer but also a disciple of Browning's, he nevertheless vigorously
attacks that great master's cacophony and wilful obscurity of meaning, in
that eccentric curiosity of diction "The Sword of Song," in which our ears
are assailed by the most monstrous diversity of noises, following in a rapid
and dazzling succession till the ideas engendered in our brains are sporting
in an outburst of mental leap-frog. The following are a few:

              "Fleas kill us"           with         "Aeschylus"
              "Trough hock lees"        "            "Sophocles"
              "Globule us"              "            "Aristobulus"*

*The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 145.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And here is a good example:

              Let me help Babu Chander Grish up!
              As by a posset of Hunyadi
              Clear mind! Was Soudan of the Mahdi
              Not cleared by Kitchener? Ah, Tchhup!
              Such nonsense for sound truth you dish up,
              Were I magician, no mere cadi,
              Not Samuel's ghost you'd make me wish up,
              Nor Saul's (the mighty son of Kish) up,
              But Ingersoll's or Bradlaugh's, pardie!
              By spells and cauldron stews that squish up,
              Or purifying of the Nadi,
              Till Stradivarius or Amati
              Shriek in my stomach! Sarasate,
              Such strains! Such music as once Sadi
              Made Persia ring with! I who fish up
              No such from soul may yet cry: Vade
              Retro Satanas! Tom Bond Bishop!*

*The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 148. Browning's cacophony in "The Flight of the
Duchess" is truly extraordinary:
              "Soul a stir up"    with  "streaky syrup"
              "Went trickle"      "     "ventricle"
              "Sperm oil"         "     "turmoil"
              "Wreathy hop"       "     "Æthiop"
              "Matters equine"    "     "French weak wine."

We have mentioned "Why Jesus Wept" as one of the most irregular of
Crowley's poems, yet its irregularities are regularly irregular throughout,
bearing a similar relationship to a true poem like "Rosa Mundi" that a comic
song would to a great oratorio. "Why Jesus Wept" is a satiric farce, "Rosa
Mundi" a great love anthem, almost we might say a Wagnerian opera in
rime, and comparable in many respects in its continuous though irregular
symphony to the "Lycidas" of Milton. Yet, nevertheless, "Why Jesus Wept"
is the more characteristic of the two, and certainly the most iconoclastic of
any.

In "Orpheus," Books I and II, we find a poetic regularity almost strictly
adhered to, not so, however, in Book III, and in "The Argonauts." But it is
_____________________________________________________________________________________
not till we get to "Rodin in Rime" that we find practically every sonnet and
quatorzain possessing some infringement of the orthodox rules of poetry; yet
it cannot be said that these poems, chiefly in iambic verse broken by the
occasional introduction of another foot, usually an anapaest, read
unmusically on account of its presence. Take for instance:

             Cloistral seclusion of the galleried pines
             Is mine to-day: these groves are fit for Pan--
             O rich with Bacchic frenzy, and his wine's
             Atonement for the infinite woe of man!*

*W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119.

Here "cloistral" is a spondee; "eried pines," an (imperfect) anapaest; and so
on.

Again in "La Fortune":

             "Hail, Tyche! From the Amalthean horn
             Pour forth the store of love! I lowly bend
             Before thee: I invoke thee at the end
             When other gods are fallen and put to scorn.
             Thy foot is to my lips; my sighs unborn
             Rise, touch and curl about thy heart; they spend
             Pitiful love. Lovelier pity, descend
             And bring me luck who am lonely and forlorn."*

*W.E. Henley, Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 120. Compare the following verse in
Swinburne's poem, The Centenary of the Battle of the Nile:
             The strong and sunbright lie whose name was France
             Arose against the sun of truth, whose glance
                    Laughed large from the eyes of England fierce as fire
             Whence eyes wax blind that gaze in truth askance.

Here "piti" is a trochee; "lovelier," a spondee; "pity," a trochee. The whole
metre breaks up, as if the singer's heart burst in despair.

Whilst in "Bouches d'Enfer" we find such lines as:

       From the long-held leash! The headlong, hot-mouthed girl,*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119.

in which, as we read, we feel a veritable stretching of the mental leather, as
it were; our minds being held back a space by the introduction of the word
"long." This quatorzain ends:

               Of smouldering infamy. Bow down in awe!
               It is enough. The Gods are at feast. Withdraw!*

*Rodin in Rime, vol. iii, p. 119.

Again the same mental stress.

All the above are contrary to the rules of scansion, yet nevertheless they are
musical. And though in "Rodin in Rime" perhaps Crowley slightly overdoes
this introduction of irregular lines, yet they add a great charm, as they do in
many of his other poems, producing in their lingering pause or quick jump
an ecstatic spasm, if we may so call it, which renders so many of these
poems unique. Such as in "Styx" we find:

               The fourth, to draw her kisses and to keep;
                       The fifth, for love; the sixth, in sweet despair;
                       The seventh, to destroy us unaware;
               The eighth, to dive within the infernal deep.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 183.

"In" would scan better; but by replacing it by "within" we can feel the dark
waters close over us as we are borne down their unfathomable depths.
Similarly in the following:

               Aching with all the pangs of night
                       My shuddering body swoons; my eyes
               Absorb her eyelids' lazy light,
                       And read her bosom...*

*Jezebel, vol. i, p. 131.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The extra half-step in "shuddering" in place of discordantly jarring on the
metre produces a keener sense of agony in the reader's mind than a word
which scanned correctly would do.

In the next passage, taken from "Tannhäuser," we find the introduction of a
spondee carrying with it a curious sensation of slowness:

             Chaos, a speck; and space, a span;
             Ruinous cycles fallen in,
             And Darkness on the Deep of Time.
             Murmurous voices call and climb;
             Faces, half-formed, arise; and He
             Looked from the shadow of His throne,
             The curtain of Eternity;*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 251. (The italics are mine.)

whilst in the last verse of "The Palace of the World" the sudden dropping of
a whole foot produces with it a sudden sense of finality:

             Thine be the kingdom! Thine the power!
                       The glory triply thine!
             Thine, through Eternity's swift hour,
                       Eternity, thy shrine--
             Yea, by the holy lotus-flower,
                       Even mine!*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 205.

Further on in the same series of poems a sudden whirring sense of madness
is produced by introducing the word "lunatic" into an otherwise regular line:

             Silence, deep silence. Not a shudder stirs
                       The vast demesne of unforgetful space,
             No comet's lunatic rush: no meteor whirs,
                       No star dares breathe. . .*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 209.

Again, in such lines as:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Secure the sacred fastness of the soul,
             Uniting self to the absolute, the whole,*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 107.

our ears tell us at once that the extra half-step is intentionally introduced.
Whilst in such a line as:

             And loving servant of my lady and lord,*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 98.

they do not. The "y" in lady might by some be considered an admissible
elision with the "and." But I myself should not pass it, though in the
following I should:

             Many the spirits broken for one man;
                     Many the men that perish to create
             One God the more; many the weary and wan*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 210.

In the last line of the succeeding verse the metre (I should say) is not
unimpeachable:

             Lower, an ocean of flowers,
                     Trees that are warmer and leafier,
             Starrier, sunnier hours
                     Spurning the strain of all grief here,
             Bringing a quiet delight to us, beyond our belief, here.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 125.

Whilst in the next three cases I consider it distinctly faulty:

             I see the thin web binding me
             With thirteen cords of unity
             Toward the calm centre of the sea.*1.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               Where larkspur and cornflower
               Are blue with sunlight's hour,*2.

               Ring out your frosty peal, and smite
               Loud fingers on the harp, and touch
               Lutes, and clear psalteries musical,
               And all stringed instruments, to indite*3.

*1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 31.
*2. Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 103.
*3. Jephthah, vol. i, p. 74.

The first two of the above are quoted from poems published in 1898, and the
last from those published a year later. I will not say that they are the only
imperfections to be found throughout these works, but I will say that there
are very few others. And considering that Aleister Crowley has written about
one hundred thousand lines in the space of ten years, or half the quantity
produced by Robert Browning in fifty-six, the fewness of imperfections in
his work is truly remarkable.

Let us now pass from what I may call the Poetic Iconomachy to the Poetic
Iconolatry of these poems; from Aleister Crowley's war against poetic form,
to his adoration of poetic imagery; and then to the keynote of the whole of
his poetry, and, as we shall presently see, his philosophy as well, namely--
Ecstasy.

In "Gargoyles" we find several truly wonderful picture poems. Thus in "The
White Cat":

               Hail, sweet my sister! hail, adulterous spouse,
                        Gilded with passionate pomp, and gay with guilt:
               Rioting, rioting in the dreary house
                        With blood and wine and roses splashed and spilt
               About thy dabbling feet, and aching jaws
                        Whose tongue licks mine, twin asps like moons that curl,
               Red moons of blood! Whose catlike body claws,
                        Like a white swan raping a jet-black girl,
               Mine, with hysteric laughter...*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 86.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And the following four verses in "Saida" are superb:

             The spears of the night at her onset
             Are lords of the day for a while,
             The magical green of the sunset,
             The magical blue of the Nile.
                        Afloat are the gales
                        In our slumberous sails
             On the beautiful breast of the Nile.

             We have swooned through the midday exhausted
             By the lips ­ they are whips ­ of the sun,
             The horizon befogged and befrosted
             By the haze and the grays and the dun
                        Of the whirlings of sand
                        Let loose on the land
             By the wind that is born of the sun.
             .      .    .   .   .  .   .   .  . . .   . .
             Thrilled through to the marrow with heat
             We abode (as we glode) on the river.
             Every arrow he launched from his seat,
             From the white inexhaustible quiver,
                        Smote us right through,
                        Smote us and slew,
             As we rode on the rapturous river.

             Sweet sleep is perfection of love.
             To die into dreams of my lover,
             To wake with his mouth like a dove
             Kissing me over and over!
                        Better sleep so
                        Than be conscious, and know
             How death hath a charm to discover.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 94.

But not until we read "The Eyes of Pharaoh" do we read one of the most
astounding paintings in words, I make bold to say, that has ever been written
in any language:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              And death's insufferable perfume
                        Beat the black air with golden fans
              As Turkis rip a Nubian's womb
                        With damascenéd yataghans.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 100.

This one astonishing verse upsets the equilibrium of the whole poem, as it
would of any poem; for if the remaining thirteen had been penned in an
equivalent vividness of colouring, the effect would have been one of
complete overpowerment rather than of a sudden and dizzy joy.

As the aristocratic virtues of one century become the democratic vices of the
next, so do the noble renderings of one age of literature become the
hackneyed phraseology of the following, this being true whether we are
speaking of poetry or prose. Vet one attribute alone remains ever youthful as
the ages roll by into the aeons, and that is-- Ecstasy; whether we find it in
the rapture of Love, the melody of Song, or the fire of Deity, it is what Poe
meant by "elevating excitement," and as we have seen, it was because of its
absence that he attacked the Epic school of verse.

Ecstasy lies beyond our gnosis; as we shall hereafter see, it carries us out of
ourselves, beyond the mere shell of existence, into the very depths of the
profound. For the fraction of a second the whole ocean of our being is
whirled through a narrow gorge, then once again we are hurled forth into the
eddying cataracts of life, an essential spirit light gilding once again the
sepulchral abode of a corpse. For a moment we behold God, face to face, but
for a moment only, then all again is night. Keats attained, and so did Shelley
and Browning. Read the last verses of the "Prometheus Unbound" and "A
Grammarian's Funeral," and all will be plain; and it is this same ecstasy that
burns white in these two superb poems, which flames a bright star of beauty
guiding us on our long journey across the hundred thousand leagues of the
empire of Crowley's pen. We find it shining brightly over almost every
page, a fact which renders the task of quoting nigh endless. Already we have
cited a dozen or more examples. Volume I flames like a subtly gemmed ring
with the ecstasy of many moments, and many of the following citations in
this essay will be both brilliant and flashing; and as are the sides of the
Heptagonal Vault, so also will be the contents of these seven chapters. But
here at least we shall alone content ourselves with quoting from one poem--
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"Orpheus," and then only loose from the massive setting a few of its flashing
stones.

In Book I the invocation of Venus is very fine. The third verse being:

                         Down to the loveless sea
                         Where lay Persephone
                 Violate, where the shade of earth is black,
                         Crystalline out of space
                         Flames the immortal face!
                 The glory of the comet-tailéd track
                         Blinds all black earth with tears.
                         Silence awakes and hears
                 The music of thy moving come over the starry spheres.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, p. 168.

The song of "The Hours,"*1. and "Spring,"*2. are also magnificent, as are
the Invocation of Hecate;*3. the three Judges,*4. and the Furies;*5. the latter
of which is one of the most musical lyrics Crowley has as yet written. The
Song of Orpheus flashes and flames as we read it:

*1. Orpheus, vol. iii, pp. 145.
*2. Ibid, vol. iii, pp. 146, 147.
*3. Ibid, vol. iii, p. 177.
*4. Ibid, vol. iii, p. 182-187.
*5. Ibid, vol. iii, p. 194-199.

                 The magical task and the labour is ended;
                         The toils are unwoven, the battle is done;
                 My lover comes back to my arms, to the splendid
                         Abyss of the air and abode of the sun.
                 The sword be assuaged, and the bow be unbended!
                         The labour is past, and the victory won.

                 The arrows of song through Hell cease to hurtle.
                         Away to the passionate gardens of Greece,
                 Where the thrush is awake, and the voice of the turtle
                         Is soft in the amorous places of peace,
                 And the tamarisk groves and the olive and myrtle
                         Stir ever with love and content and release.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              O bountiful bowers and O beautiful gardens!
                       O isles in the azure Ionian deep!
              Ere ripens the sun, ere the spring-wind hardens
                       Your fruits once again ye shall have me to keep.
              The sleep-god laments, and the love-goddess pardons,
                       When love at the last sinks unweary to sleep.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, pp. 200.

As also does the song of Orpheus:

              O Hawk of gold with power enwalled,
              Whose face is like an emerald;
              Whose crown is indigo as night;
                       Smaragdine snakes about thy brow
              Twine, and the disc of flaming light
                       Is on thee, seated in the prow
              Of the Sun's bark, enthroned above
              With lapis-lazuli for love
                       And ruby for enormous force
              Chosen to seat thee, thee girt round
              With leopard's pell, and golden sound
                       Of planets choral in their course!
              O thou self-formulated sire!
              Self-master of thy dam's desire!
              Thine eyes blaze forth with fiery light;
                       Thine heart a secret sun of flame!
              I adore the insuperable might:
                       I bow before the unspoken Name.

              For I am Yesterday, and I
                       To-day, and I to-morrow, born
              Now and again, on high, on high
                       Travelling on Dian's naked horn!
              I am the Soul that doth create
                       The Gods, and all the kin of Breath.
              I come from the sequestered state;
                       My birth is from the House of Death.

      I have risen! I have risen! as a mighty hawk of gold!
      From the golden egg I gather, and my wings the world enfold.
      I alight in mighty splendour from the thronéd boats of light;
      Companies of Spirits follow me; adore the Lords of Night.
      Yea, with gladness did they pæan, bowing low before my car,
      In my ears their homage echoed from the sunrise to the star.
      I have risen! I am gathered as a lovely hawk of gold,
      I the first-born of the Mother in her ecstasy of old.
      Lo! I come to face the dweller in the sacred snake of Khem;
      Come to face the Babe and Lion, come to measure force with
              them!
      Ah! these locks flow down, a river, as the earth's before the
              Sun,
      As the earth's before the sunset, and the God and I are One.
      I who entered in a Fool, gain the God by clean endeavour;
      I am shaped as men and women, fair for ever and for ever.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, pp. 209, 210.

Such is the living poetry that abides and ever lives on, knowing no youth or
age, alone an eternal manhood. Lavishly scattered, we find it throughout the
works before us; in "Aceldama," "Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic," "The
Temple of the Holy Ghost," "Tannhäuser," "Rosa Mundi," and "Alice."
Ecstasy is the keynote here, as it is of all poetry, all literature ­ aye! of all
Life. Without it we cease to be even animals ­ a dog will bay the moon ­
mere lumps of sodden clay; with it a flaming crown of glory, angel-voiced,
singing amidst the stars the anthem of Eternity.

           The Chapter known as

              The Virgin

In which chapter it is related how beauteous
 and fair she was to behold, and with what
 joyaunce and jollity she greeted her many
  lovers, and how she fed off their kisses
    and growing bold was cast forth to
          feed amongst the swine.

                                   The Virgin


"TO be a singer of sweet songs," is the great ideal Crowley has enshrined
before him; for varied as his powers are, entwined with satire, philosophy
and mysticism, as a singer of lyrics and love-songs Aleister Crowley
remains unsurpassed, unrivalled, among the host of present-day poets. His
thoughts are as subtle, his imagination as gorgeous, his melodies as
charming as those of Shelley himself; soft as a summer breeze, fresh as the
dawn in May, sunny as a June day, and then furious with burning passion
and vitriolic lust. So closely interwoven in spirit are the true lyrics with the
remainder of his amatory poetry, that it would be dangerous to attempt to
separate them, and such an attempt would almost certainly lead to repetition
or a breaking of the chain of psychosexual sensations, dimming that lustre
which thrills through these magnificent verses, from the chaste kiss of a
mother to the Phaedrian embrace of a Sadistic sow.

In "Why Jesus Wept," we have the ephemeral and headstrong passion of
youth; whilst in "The Tale of Archais" we find it burning only as a pure and
lambent flame, overcoming all adversity, sacrificing self-love and even self-
honour to attain the ideal of its purpose.

Love is the predominant power in the universe; over and over again we shall
find this enforced, greater than fame, than wealth, than glory, greater than
knowledge, greater than wisdom, greater than the power of the Gods
themselves; for they too must worship at the shrine of Love, the shrine of the
great World Mother, the mystic Isis, goddess of beauty, mother of love,
queen of laughter, mistress of pleasure. "I am all that has been, that shall be,
and none among mortals has hitherto taken off my veil."*

*Inscribed on the statue of the Goddess.

Innocent friendship or platonic love can never be a success where the rapture
of a kiss is burning on the lips of two lovers; the first spells ignorance and
the second failure, for love will out, and if not as a limpid and sparkling
stream, then as a turbid and roaring torrent, reckless and horrible. This
extraordinary phase of diverted* love is very strongly illustrated in "The
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Fatal Force," "The Mother's Tragedy," and also in "Jezebel"; not so in
"Tannhäuser" and "The Nameless Quest," where love is not restrained, but
rather cramped by the gnostic idea of evil in the objective. This curious idea
we will go into more fully later on, at present we shall content ourselves in
dealing with the first phase of Love ­ love in youth.

*"Perverted" I object to here, as it is but a synonym of `converted' from a different point
of view.

In "Why Jesus Wept," which is a satirical serio-comedy, mingled with
heterodox ribaldry, and a shrewd and sweeping cynicism on the utter
rottenness of social life, we find love in youth depicted in the person of Sir
Percy Percival, aged sixteen. The first effusion of puberty is described in
the-following three lines:

                      ...what shall slake
                      This terrible thirst,
                      This torment accurst?*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 28.

This, as is usually the case, finds an outlet in the first pretty maid who
happens to cross youth's burning path, and in this case the fair damozel is
Molly Tyson, and the first scene of their meeting is most typical:

       Sir Percy. Ah, love, love, how I love you. This is the world! Love!
       Love! I love you so, my darling. Oh my white golden heart of glory!*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 30.

Eternity is moulded in form of her kiss, and even if "Hell belch its monsters
one by: one to stop the way! I would be there" cries Sir Percy as he and
Molly rush backwards and forwards kissing and kissing before they can
finally part. And no sooner has he parted with her, having sworn eternal love
and to meet her at moonrise, than he stumbles across a bedizened hag of
sixty-three (society), and in ten minutes, because she calls herself "the
wretchedest girl on the wide earth," discovers "she is most beautiful"; "How
she speaks! It is indeed an angel singing," and asks if he may call her
Angela, and forgets his poor village girl, and utterly overcome when she
says, ("I am a poor and simple girl, and my eyes are aching with the sight of
_____________________________________________________________________________________
you, and my lips are mad to kiss you!") falls into her arms learning his first
great lesson; for as Angela says, "it is dangerous, as well as cruel to leave a
lover standing."

To wake again to all the effervesence of efflorescent youth:

                                     Awake! awake!
             There is a secret in our subtle union
             That masters the grey snake.
             Awake, O Love! and let me drink my fill
             Of thee ­ and thou of me!*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40.

His subtle union, however, is soon about to vanish, for Angela in a day or so
will have just about had her fill:

             Angela.          Die, then, and kiss me dead!
             Sir Percy.       I die! I die!
             Angela.          Thy flower-life is shed
                              Into eternity,
                              A waveless lake.*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41.

He sleeps, and she awake becomes somewhat weary of these "jejune
platitudes," these "ululations of preposterous puberty," these very
"eructations of gingerbread" and "flatulence of calf-sickness."* Soon he is
kicked flying out of her ladyship's bed, and here we must leave him for a
time to meet him again and his first love Molly further on, though not under
the sunshine of youthful amorosis.

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41.

A different phase and a much more pleasing one of the impulsiveness of
youthful love is given us in that glowing story "The Tale of Archais." There
are many mysteries in this poem. Charicles the desire striving after Archais
the ideal, failing, and the ideal seeking the lost desire; but outwardly we
have, and visible to all, a true poem of the self-sacrifice of Love, and as such
_____________________________________________________________________________________
I think we should principally read it, the poetry of life and hope, and not the
mystic throbs of some deep aspiration.

Charicles and Archais are the golden children of the Tree of Life; she is
under the curse of Jove ­ as all pure love has been under the anathema of
some god ­ and he, blinded by his love, sets the mystic key in the secret
lock, opening to his desire the hidden corridor of knowledge; the spell falls
hissing as a snake. The picture of their meeting is beautiful indeed. Thus we
find Archais:

                 She lay within the water, and the sun
                 Made golden with his pleasure every one
                 Of small cool ripples that surround her throat,
                 Mix with her curls, and catch the hands that float
                 Like water-lilies on the wave.*1.
                 .    . .   .    .    . .   .   .   .   .  .  .
                 Chance bowed herself across the sunny bars,
                 And watched where through the silence of the lawn
                 Came Charicles, the darling of the dawn,
                 Slowly, and to his steps took little heed;
                 He came towards the pool, his god-wrought reed
                 Shrilling dim visions of things glorious,
                 And saw the maiden, that disported thus,
                 And worshipped...*2.

*1. The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 7.
*2. Ibid. vol. i, p. 8.

As Percy, "a moment, and he flashed towards her side." He clasps her to his
breast, kisses her, is dismayed:

                 Her perfect eyelids drooped, her warm cheek paled,
                 A tear stole over it.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 8.

He is tender, pitiful, this is no Angela.

                 My perfect love, O love! for strange and dread
                 Delights consume me; I am as one dead
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Beating at Heaven's gate with nerveless wing.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 8.

Charicles then sings the rather mystic song which opens as follows:

             Man's days are dim, his deeds are dust,
                     His span is but a little space,
             He lusts to live, he lives to lust,
             His soul is barren of love or trust,
             His heart is hopeless, seeing he must
                     Perish, and leave no trace."

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 9.

He bids her gaze into his eyes,

             With love, my cheeks with passion burn--
             As thy clear eyes may well discern
                     By gazing into mine.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 9.

Who could withstand the sweet witchery of such a lover's wooing? least of
all Archais; her breast, reluctant yet helpless, heaves with a soft passion, no
wise understood, her pulse quickens, she speaks, he is enthralled:

                                                 the piercing flame
             Of love struck through him, till his tortured mind
             Drove his young limbs, the wolf that hunts the hind,
             Far through the forest...*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 9.

And then again bursts from his lips the enraptured song:

             Ere the grape of joy is golden
                     With the summer and the sun,
             Ere the maidens unbeholden
                     Gather one by one,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              To the vineyard comes the shower,
              No sweet rain to fresh the flower,
                     But the thunder rain that cleaves,
                     Rends and ruins tender leaves.
              .   .   .     .    .    . . .  .   .  .   .   .
              Ere the crimson lips have planted
                     Paler roses, warmer grapes,
              Ere the maiden breasts have panted,
                     And the sunny shapes
              Flit around to bless the hour,
              Comes men know not what false flower:
                     Ere the cup is drained, the wine
                     Grows unsweet, that was divine.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, pp. 9, 10.

These last two lines contain the whole secret of this story. The beauty of the
clinging love of childhood is tinged with a glowing desire, the pink desire of
the bud bursts into the passionate crimson of the rose, and as in "Alice,"
"The dove gave place a moment to the swine;" ­ and yet hardly so! the pure
desire of man and woman in whatever state of life, the weaving of the
golden web of twain into one entity, is not lust, never was lust, never will be
lust.

According to the conventional meaning of that word, lust expresses
something unhealthy, unclean; and the love Charicles bore Archais was
certainly not that. This love, to use a good old English word, was a "lusty"
love, that is a healthy love, and not a lustful or perverted desire. The beauty
of nature, the beauty of living, and above all the bright beauty of Archais;
intoxicated him; before him whirled visions of loveliness, and as her eyes
reflected the passion of his own, as they smiled back on him all the love he
bore her, yielding, he caught her up as a flame would another, and the "iron
rod of law" grew misty, for they were one, one in body, mind and soul;
alone for that moment, sole inhabitants of this World ­ Infinite. The moment
is over, the girl rises up a woman, the wreath of lilies is now a crown of
roses, she has plucked the golden fruit of Eden, henceforth she is a priestess
of Sorrow; the crushed and bruised flowers cry to her "such as we were we
are not, such as thou wert thou canst never be again." The horrid spell falls
upon her, and she writhes from his arms a snake.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Charicles trembling, fearful, at last becomes aware that fate has overtaken
them; then all the fury of manhood rises in him:

               Erect, sublime, he swore so fierce an oath
               That the sea flashed with blasphemy, and loath
               Black thunders broke from out the shuddering deep.
               He swore again, and from its century's sleep
               Earthquake arose, and rocked and raved and roared.
               He swore the third time. But that Heaven's Lord
               Curbed their black wrath, the stars of Heaven's vault.
               Had rushed to whelm the sun with vehement assault.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 12. Cf. the Qabalistic Dogma of Pistorius: "Schema
misericordiam dicit, sed et judicium." The Infinite Being when exercising his power upon
the finite must necessarily chastise to correct and not to avenge himself. The strength of
the sin does not exceed that of the sinner, and if the punishment be greater than the
offence, he who inflicts it becomes executioner and is the real criminal, who is wholly
inexcusable, and himself alone deserving of eternal punishment. Any being who is
tortured above measure, enlarged by an infinitude of suffering, would become God, and
this is what the ancients represented in the myth of Prometheus, immortalized by the
devouring vulture, and destined to dethrone Jupiter. --The Mysteries of Magic, p. 120.

Such is the power of Love, undaunted, infuriated in the cause of Freedom,
Justice, and Truth. Charicles plunges into the waves of destiny, "And with
his strenuous hands the emerald water gripped." Onward he swims striving
against Poseidon, god of the ocean, who heaps the sea foam against him, as
he makes for the Paphian isle to seek aid from the goddess of Love; and in
his blinding anger he sees her not, though she is by his side journeying
homeward from Rome. She raises the swimmer to her pearly car and carries
him to her fair home, where in the following beautiful symbolic action she
promises to restore him his lost love ­ Archais.

               Then Aphrodite loosed a snake of gold
               From her arm's whiteness, and upon his wrist
               Clasped it. Its glittering eyes of amethyst
               Fascinate him. "Even so," the goddess cried,
               "I will bind on thy arm the serpent bride
               Freed from her fate, and promise by this kiss
               The warmer kisses of thy Archais."*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, pp. 13, 14.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The handmaidens of Aphrodite gather round them, and their silver voices
rise in one of those sweet clear songs, already so familiar to our ears, set like
a gem in the gold of the narrative. The following rondel I choose for its
simplicity and sweetness:

             Sing, little bird, it is dawn;
             Cry! with the day the woods ring;
             Now in the blush of the morn,
                              Sing!

             Love doth enchain me and cling,
                     Love, of the breeze that is born,
             Love, with the breeze that takes wing.

             Love that is lighter than scorn,
                     Love that is strong as a king,
             Love, through the gate that is horn,
                              Sing!*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 14.

The anger of Zeus is aroused. Aphrodite bids Charicles flee, but his passion
is too great, he defies the powers. (They are only gods; would he have
succeeded had they been Grundy?) The curse of Zeus is reversed:

             His form did change, and, writhing from her clasp,
             Fled hissing outward, a more hateful asp
             Than India breeds to-day.
             .   .    .     .    .  .  .  .  .   .     .  . .
                                                ...till day
             Dropped her blue pinions, and the night drew on,
             And sable clouds banked out the weary sun.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 16.

The whole course of events is now reversed, Charicles a venomous adder,
Archais once again her own divine and glorious self. And this is how we
find her the second time:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             It was a pinnacle of ivory
             Whereon she stood, the loftiest of three fangs
             Thrust up by magic, in the direst pangs
             Of Earth, when Earth was yet a whirling cloud
             Of fire and adamant, a ceaseless crowd
             Of rushing atoms roaring into space,
             Driven by demons from before the Face.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 17.

So beautiful was she, that "the sun forgot his chariot, nor would set"; and in
this mystic hour, the marriage of Day and Night, she prayed fervently to
Aphrodite, fond goddess of lovers, and there amidst the thunder-smitten
stone, beautiful and piteous, she waited, longing for that strong desire of
love that had been so rudely snatched from her. Again, Love in the form of
Aphrodite listens to her prayer, but is helpless to help her till she has sought
aid from the lewd city of Aphaca, where Lust in the grim shape of Priapus
dwelt.

             The large-lipped drawn-out grinning of that court
             That mouthed and gibbered in their swinish sport.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 19.

This curious duality of Love and Lust, or better, of Virtue and Vice, we shall
attempt to explain more fully when we deal with the philosophy of Aleister
Crowley.

From Priapus, Phallommeda gains her necessary information, and then
seeking Charicles, appears first as an old hag, soon to change again into her
own brilliant form, thus symbolizing the joy she brought him from out the
hideousness of his fate; for during the day he should assume the form of the
divinest of divine maidens, and only at the passionate hour of noon, crawl
away before the full glory of the sun a wriggling serpent. She bids him seek
Zeus, and leaves the rest to him. "To the lascivious shade of Ida's deep
recesses" he wends his way:

             So fair, her image in the brook might make
             A passionless old god his hunger slake
             By plunging in the waters, though he knew
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              His drowning body drowned her image too.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 21.

There he, or now she, meets the great god wandering through the green trees
and the cool groves, as Jahveh was wont once to do. Amidst those shades of
Ida, where Paris adjudged the prize of beauty, overlooking the blue
Hellespont, the greatest sacrifice, and thereby the purest that love can make,
was to be demanded, and freely given ­ the sacrifice of a woman's honour to
save her lover; in fact to become a prostitute in body, and a virgin in spirit.
He, Zeus, is "weary of women's old lascivious breed," and of "the large
luxurious lips of Ganymede." No freshness, no restraint, no virgin breast, no
lips "without a taint of lewd imagining," all the nymphs of those green
wooded slopes, all are as brazen and cold as the meretrices of a suburrian
lupanar, the fire of love having burnt itself out to the ashen lassitude of
satiety. At length the god finds her asleep under some shady tree, and creeps
towards her ­ little loath

              To waken her caresses, and let noon
              Fade into midnight in the amorous swoon.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 21.

His voluptuous lips touch her smooth cheek, she wakes, she flees, she is
caught; "panting," "timid," "tremulous":

              And he with open lips voluptuous
              Closed her sweet mouth with kisses, and so pressed
              Her sobbing bosom with a manlier breast
              That...*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 22.

She submits, not to the god, but to the man. Within the god, the godhood
vanishes; for the power of love rules all, and the god once again becomes
incarnated in the form of a divine man.*

*Eros (c.) descending upon God (hwhy.), transforms God into (hwchy.) Christ.

                                    So the morning past
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              And found them linked inexorably fast
              Each in the other's arms. Their lips are wed
              To drink the breezes from the fountainhead
              Of lovers' breath.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 22.

Then all her senses leap to the melodious song of Zeus, a divine lyric; the
following are two of its seven beautiful verses:

                     O lamp of love!
              The hissing spray shall jet thee with desire
                     And foaming fire,
                     And fire from thee shall move
              Her spirit to devour,
              And fuse and mingle us in one transcendent hour.

                     Godhead is less
              Than mortal love, the garland of the spheres,
                     Than those sweet tears
                     That yield no bitterness
              To the luxurious cries
              That love shrills out in death, that murmur when love
                     dies.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 23.

The hour of noon approaches, it falls, and the curse resumes its sway; a fiery
snake winds its coils round the sleeping god, and hisses in his ear, "awake!"
The god has fallen, the god is caught, caught and bound in the lusts of the
manhood he assumed. No Galilean is he to be crucified for his own or
others' sins, and he wins his freedom at the price of Charicles' liberty.
Nature breaks into a welcome chant of joy, the lovers are reunited, the men's
praise is for Archais, and the eyes of the maidens are fixed on Charicles. The
tale is nearly ended, the lovers wend their way through the joyous throng
midst song and chorus, then from the lips of Archais rises:

              Light and dark are wed together
                     Into golden weather:
              Sun and moon have kissed, and built
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                     Palaces star-gilt
       Whence a crystal stream of joy, love's eternal wine, is spilt.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 24.

Such is one of the most pleasing of Aleister Crowley's poems; touched by
the genuine breath of adoration for the beautiful, a jewel set in fiery gold, a
crimson sash embroidered with the pearls of the glowing orient; Archais is
one of the tenderest and most touching of women, wholly pure, not like
Molly Tyson, who afterwards fell to the lot of a worldly old lecher. The rosy
couch of her first fiery experience soon withered to a thorny briar bed, as it
has for most of us. Her curse was a god's, Molly's Society's ­ poor Molly!
Charicles' love was the love of the hurricane, which carries all before it,
typhoonic; he knew no fears, no bonds, he cursed the god who had
defrauded him of his loved one; and plunged undaunted into the ocean of
adversity; to win back their former state he sacrificed himself. He was no Sir
Percy, flatulent with wind, who could not tell a harlot from a virgin; falling
at once a prey to a bedizened old prostitute of sixty-three.

Those who should think the passion displayed in this tale as unbecoming and
lustful, must indeed have minds composed of dung and cantharides,
disappointed sterile old maids, or sated old matrons, pornophobics of the
worst description. We know well the class, half Exeter Hall, half Empire
Music-hall; "douée" (as a charming little French brochure describes one of
this type), "du plus voluptueux tempérament courut longtemps les
aventures... mais ses ans et le grand usage altérèrent ses charmes, et elle prit
le parti ordinaire, de donner à Dieu ce qu'elle ne pouvait plus offrir aux
hommes, et pleura dans l'hypocrisie trente ans d'amour et de plaisir." We
know the type well, and so does Aleister Crowley; his Angela, before she
fell into the boiling sulphuric acid, which was being prepared to remove her
enamel, was president of a Zenana Mission.

Love is, as must now be apparent, an all engrossing theme in the poetry of
Aleister Crowley, every phase almost meeting with an illustration. We have
seen the flatulent love of youth, and its counterpart in the divine poetic
sincerity of Charicles and Archais; we will now view it in its maturer form,
and firstly, in the form of true and sincere love, unconventional and pure,
whether under the bond of marriage, or under the boundless bond of free
love, between two souls of similar affinity. True love is a pure, unalloyed
attraction, urging two souls from their inherited duality into their inherent
_____________________________________________________________________________________
oneness, that all are capable of attaining, and yet so few attain; and it is on
account of the fewness of its adepts, that the magic of their worship has
become to the clouded eyes of the many a heinous offence, reflecting a light
that they cannot find in their gloomy atmosphere.

Laws are the concrete opinions of the many, morals the abstract sensations
of the few. Outside ourselves ethics do not exist, for they are the great
faculty of sentient existence. The law of the survival of the fittest is not
moral, it is essential; but, manifested through reason it becomes ethical. As
regards the aspirations of the sexes, nature cares little whether John loves
Ann or Mary. Man, however, cares much. John is not married, Ann is;
Nature implants a similar affinity in both, and they verge towards their own
magnetic centre. Nature says "unite!" Man, however, thinks otherwise and
so builds up a stout abatis out of the dead bones of unreasoning ages,
fencing Ann in; and even if John does surmount this formidable obstacle, a
moral fougasse awaits for his impetuous footstep, which will morally blow
him to smithereens. Again, John is unmarried, and Mary is in a similar state
of bliss, their affinities repel and do not attract: Nature says "keep apart!";
man says "I would rather see you unite with Mary than I would with Ann,
affinities be damned!" They unite, and axiomatize the postulate of Hell.
Nature now says "part!" man says "Oh! no you don't." Around them are
then speedily constructed such labyrinthine entanglements, that few find
their way out, and still fewer attempt so difficult a task ­ hence Churches
and Brothels. If John, however, does not marry Mary, Ann squalls, but as the
jailer can always let himself out of the prison, so can man, if he does not
drop his keys through some matrimonial grating. Ann then locks up Mary in
that Bastille of despair which is called Piccadilly (this is no paradox) ­ hence
prudes and nymphs. Thus Nature is scouted and thumped on the nose
because she is essential, and man is enthroned in her stead and smacked on
the back because he happens to be moral ­ hence Universities and Lunatic
asylums.

In Love, mankind eternally verges between folly and knavery, because man
is a non-essential being, and Nature an un-moral power.

But before we enter on the above idea as demonstrated in the poems of
Aleister Crowley, it will be necessary to elucidate matters, and first to enter
on a brief description of the Essential and the Moral; showing that man as
usual has got hold of "the muddy end of the stick"; that the majority of the
human species live in a state of purulent hypocrisy and mental indolence,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
and that the minority should consider themselves exceptionally fortunate if
they save their souls from incarceration in the bolgia of conventional
respectability.

Aleister Crowley's gospel of Love is the gospel of Freedom. As love is one
of those particular qualities that cannot possibly thrive under the perception
of restraint, so can it only bloom in perfect freedom, whether legalized or
not; all other forms are Lust.

Nature is the All-perfect, she is existence taken as a totality, and everything
being a part of her, consequently is subject to her government. The
inorganic, and what we choose to call the organic, are her two greatest
manifestations. Some consider these two as definitely separate; ethers that
the organic is but a higher form of the inorganic; and others again that both
are illusions, and that Reality, as we suppose it materially to be, does not
exist outside our own minds. We do not intend to enter here the illusive
paths of Idealism; but we might add, from a strictly logical point of view,
that the latter system has much to support it. In all and every one of us lies a
certain individual desire, which is strictly subjective, in the individual it is
called character, in the nation government. The laws of a country are the
compilation of a series of individual characterizations, a series of inner
reflections of the outer object. In each one of us there is a slight difference of
effect, and this variation results in the survival of the fittest intellect. Now
the essential difference between the spirit of an individual and that of a
nation is this: the first acts intuitively, the second mechanically; the former
propels the latter, whilst the latter reacts as a drag on the former. If the
former is in a healthy state so will the latter be; if the latter becomes corrupt
it will then react and contaminate the former. This is the law of all Form ­
i.e., Government ­ and Reform.

The outlaw of to-day was the citizen of yesterday, so the law of to-day will
become the crime of tomorrow.

Man being inherently lazy, and hence conservative, this power is forever
reacting on him, and binding him down to a government unsuited to his
times, and it is this power that he has chosen to call ­ the Moral code;
notwithstanding the fact that it is not based in any way on the perceptions he
has obtained from Nature's code as it now is reflected, but on that reflection
which was obtained by his ancestors, a far less worthy appreciation. And in
this inherent conservativeness and horror of change lie most of the tragedies
_____________________________________________________________________________________
of love; for man trying to quench the natural flame of his desires in a torrent
of chilly and criminal atavism, merely floods the virtuous path, leaving the
by-ways of vice high and dry, inviting, crying to the sated wanderer.

Man lives by paradoxes and contraries; martyrs and tortures himself,
building around him lofty restrictions bristling with moral frises, and broken
ethical beer-bottles, digging deep trenches around his joys, and then filling
them with the tears of exasperation at his lot. All is either monopoly, or
slavery, or taboo. Free in his actions he conceived law and solicitors; free in
his aspirations, religion and priests; free in his affections, marriage and
wives. Inwardly he agrees that marriage is a success only when it comprises
a total unison of mind, body and soul, of sympathies and passions;
outwardly that it is a perpetual seal, sealed by God. Dr. Maudsley once said,
"No one can escape the tyranny of his organization," but woe to the man
who cannot dissemble that he can! Marriage, the hackneyed sexual union, is
a lie to love, a legalizing of prostitution, an abortive horror, over which
broods the grinning form of the Jew-God ­ God of lechers and harlots, of
David and Rahab. What sight more truly pitiable than to behold the tender
heart of some young girl, or the ardent spirit of another, cramped by this
unnatural bond, and denied the joys of a beneficent Nature, that yearning to
love and be loved. But not with impunity do we thus triumph over our
natures; love cannot be so rudely suppressed; the primary want of our being
must inevitably conquer. Looking back on history we find few parallels to
the general lust of the present day. Two thousand years of the Cross have to-
day left as token of its morality 80,000 prostitutes on the London streets
alone.* "Can that have been human?" I see you point through the drizzling
night to a cramped and shivering form. Can that have been a woman? That
living death, degraded by crime, brutalized by vice, vitiated, unsouled; lower
than a slave, worse than a dog; spurned by man, shunned by woman, a
human wreck, a growing horror? Even so, once a smiling girl, sweet as a
rose, pure as a lily; now the bedraggled gin-sodden harridan. O! marriage,
thy name is Failure: O! priest, what hast thou done? Cramped the human
mind, betrayed thy trust, sacrificed love on the altar of Mammon, leaving the
heart as a blighted flower, the soul as a hollow shell, void, execrable.

*In 1861 Henry Mayhew stated that the assumed number of prostitutes in London was
about 80,000. And further adds-- "large as this total may appear, it is not improbable that
it is below the reality than above it. One thing is certain ­ if it be an exaggerated
statement ­ that the real number is swollen every succeeding year, for prostitution is an
inevitable attendant upon extended civilization and increased population." --London
Labour and London Poor, p. 213.

             Even love is sold, the solace of all woe
             Is turned to deadliest agony, old age
             Shivers in selfish beauty's loathing arms
             And youth's corrupted impulses prepare
             A life of horror from the blighting bane
             Of commerce; whilst the pestilence that springs
             From unenjoying sensualism, has filled
             All human life with hydra-headed woes.

So sang Shelley. Now let us turn to Aleister Crowley, and we shall find his
ideal no less great, noble and true than that of Shelley's, the divinest of the
poets and pioneers of Truth, Freedom, and Beauty.

Love is the finding in others what others cannot find in them, and it is of two
degrees. The love of a mother towards her child; and the love of man and
woman towards woman and man. The first is generally considered to be
purer and more ideal, but this idea has only grown out of man's entire
ignorance regarding the physical relationships. The mother is in no way
purer than the wife, neither is the virgin purer than the mother. The truest
definition of chastity is that as given by Benjamin Franklin, which defines
chastity as "the regulated and strictly temperate satisfaction without injury to
others, of those desires which are natural to all healthy adult beings."* The
reason for this idea of uncleanliness though certainly obscure is traceable
more particularly to the utter mystery man saw in this supreme function, and
also, that all hygienic laws being unknown to him, any disease resulting
from the act was attributed indirectly to the woman ­ instead of to his own
want of knowledge ­ and directly to the supernatural manifesting its wrath
through her as a medium; for the supernatural to primitive man's
understanding invariably took the shape of malevolent and not benevolent
powers. This and the periodic functions of the woman, as well as, as
Westermarck says, "the instinctive feeling against intercourse between
members of the same family or household," developed the conception of
uncleanliness in. an act which has been rightly stated by Geoffrey Mortimer
as being "the eternal symbol of love and life, and the purest of human joys,"
and which act being attributed to supernatural powers came under the
authority of religion, and fell into the hands of an interested priesthood,
giving them an immense power over women, and through women over men;
an influence that has been exercised in every land, and every age, by these
spiritual leaders: an influence by which they have in so many cases ruled the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
minds of men, and by which for so many centuries they have blighted the
happiest prospects of many a human heart. But surely now that we have
reached the twentieth century, thousands and thousands of years since these
primitive times, should we not shake off these trammels of infant thought,
and, assuming our manhood, decry an ideal that is not only brutal but
absurd; instead of reverencing it because of its great antiquity, or because of
our conservative sympathies with the past days of our fathers. Woman is as
clean as man, and a wife married or unmarried as pure as any virgin.
Generation is no more filthy than alimentation; both are necessary, both are
accompanied by natural appetites; the one maintains the individual, the other
the race; both may be carried to extremes, both may become lusts.

*A disciple of Pythagoras once asked him, when was it permitted him to cohabit with his
wife? To which that philosopher replied: "When you are tired of resting." Théano, wife
of Pythagoras, was also once asked: "How long does it take for a woman to be purified
who has known a man?" To which she answered: "If it is with her husband, she is
purified by the act, if with another she is for ever defiled." For it is not marriage which
sanctifies love, but love which justifies marriage. --EDOUARD SCHURÉ

The world is ever progressing onward, and we must progress with it, or else
stagnation and retrogression will set in; and in these competitive times the
latter two spell social and moral death. What was good yesterday may be
bad to-day, and what is good to-day may be evil to-morrow. What the
ultimate end will be, none can tell, for it lies "behind the veil"; but what we
must do is very certain, very definite, very sure. We must ameliorate our lot,
not by the ephemeral laws of the dead, but through the needs and wants of
the living, on the solid foundation of the truest possible morality, based on
Nature, and manifested to us through our divine powers of reason. And
much of this new morality do we find in the love-gospel of Aleister
Crowley.

First turning to the love incarnate in motherhood, we find a touching case in
the picture of Cora in "The Mother's Tragedy." Cora Vavasour, late of the
halls, yet as true and noble a woman as ever lived, a type of woman that,
thank Heaven, is not so uncommon among those whom the prudes call fallen
classes. Cora was scarcely, however, one of these; living in luxury she tried
to bury the recurring past, "Old hours of horror," and she trusted that "God
hath made smooth the road beneath the hearse" of her "forgetful age."

                Let me not shrink! Truth always purifies.

             One night I stepped up tremulous on the stage,
             Sang something, found my senses afterward
             Only to that intolerable sound
             Of terrible applause. They shook the sky
             With calling me to answer. And I lay--
             A storm of weeping swept across my frame--
             Till the polite, the hateful Manager
             Led me to face a nation's lunatic
             Roar of delight!*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 157.

That was the beginning, but she soon got over that "and over ­ yes! the other
thing."

She fell sacrificed before Mammon, loved opulence, was quoted on the
Stock Exchange, became the toy of the "prurient licksores of society" till her
bastard child was born.

                                    Childbirth sobered me.
             I loved the child, the only human love
             I ever tasted, and I sacrificed
             The popularity, the infamy,
             Of my old life; I sought another world.
             I "got religion" --how I hate the phrase!--
             So jest the matron newspapers...
             .   .   .   .     .    . .   .   .   .  .  .  .
             For I will do without a mother's name
             If only I may keep a son's love still!*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 157.

It is not here that we can enter on the fearful tragedy of these short dozen
pages, suffice it to say, that it was that of Phædra and Hippolytus, the sexes
however being reversed. Shamed, insulted by her son, she still dares kiss
him:

                                                      Why I dare
             Now take your head between my hands and kiss
             Your forehead with these shameful lips of mine,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             These harlot lips, and kiss you unashamed?*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 161.

Outraged, ravished by the offspring of her vice, yet child of her heart, she
still can say as she sees him stand before her, a fiendish monster, with the
bloody razor with which he has just slain Madeline, a pure and innocent girl:

                                    Kill yourself.

Such was her love, her duty to her motherhood; very different indeed was
the love of Ratoum. But anon.

Another picture of maternal affection, this time more musical, we find in
"The Spring after," of "Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic":

             No smallest cloud between me and my bride
             Came like a little mist; one tender fear,
             Too sweet to speak of, closed the dying year
             With love more perfect, for its purple root
             Might blossom outward to the snowy fruit
             Whose bloom to-night lay sleeping on her breast.*

*Mysteries; Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 94.

True love, the love of self in the soul of another, the poet paints very
beautifully in the following charming lines:

             Do you recall? Could I forget?
             How once the full moon shone above,
             Over the houses, and we let
             Loose rein upon the steeds of love?
             How kisses fled to kisses, rain
             Of fiery dew upon the soul
             Kindled, till ecstasy was pain;
             Desire, delight: and swift control
             Leapt from the lightning, as the cloud
             Disparted, rended, from us twain,
             And we were one:*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Star and Garter, vol. iii, p. 13.

This melting of the I in you, is the only true possible form of marriage, and
the only form that can exalt it over the prostitution of the monde and demi-
monde; for it matters little if a woman sell her body for a five pound note, or
for a five million pound dot. The man who in his turn marries a woman for
her wealth is as foul a male prostitute as ever shrieked his lewd obscenities
in the street of Sodom, and down the by-ways of Gibeah. Tannhäuser
expresses the whole celebration of this union in two pregnant lines:

              That is true marriage, in my estimate.
              Aspire together to one Deity?
              Yes!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 259.

Or again in the song of Nuith:

              We are lulled by the whirr of the stars;
                       We are fanned by the whisper, the wind;
              We are locked in unbreakable bars,
                       The love of the spirit and mind.
                                The infinite powers
                                Of rapture are ours;
              We are one, and our kisses are kind.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, p. 218.

A true wife, that is a woman whose very soul palpitates in harmony with that
of her husband or lover, is the greatest joy of life. Burns sang:

              To make a happy fireside clime
                       For weans and wife,
              Is the true pathos and sublime
                       Of human life.

And from the other side of the sphere the melodious lines of Kalidasa
reverberate with the same perfection of pure wifehood. In the Raghuvançha
the stepmothers of Rama greet Sita thus, when she blames herself for the
misfortunes which befell her husband:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                   Dear daughter, rise!
              (So said they) "Tis thy spotless life alone
              That brought thy Lord and Lakshman through their toils
              Triumphant." Then with loving words and true
              They praised her, worthy wife of worthy Lord.

What a melody lives in those words, "Twas thy spotless life alone." Rama
through all his misfortunes, through all the snares of life, finds ultimately
that all his woes are but a teardrop to be swallowed up in that boundless
ocean of love ­ the heart of a chaste and loving wife. And so did Ahinoam in
Jephthah when he said:

              And my wife's eyes were welcome more desired
              Than chains of roses, and the song of children,
              And swinging palm branches, and milk-white-elders.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 82.

No thunderous note (so common in the poems of Crowley) lies in the above
three lines, to roll on into the stillness of Immensity; it is but the song of the
nightingale by the rill of life. Here as a vision we see a fair form
embroidering the web of existence with the flowers that grow on the banks
of life's flowing stream, collecting as she works the stray threads of
philosophy, of science, of industry, of war, and of peace; the sweat, the
laughter, the tears of existence, to weave them into the great garment of
Love.

This again is the true, the Higher Love:

                                   A thousand years have passed,
              And yet a thousand thousand; years they are
              As men count years, and yet we stand and gaze
              With touching hands and lips immutable
              As mortals stand a moment;...
              The universe is One; One Soul, One Spirit,
              One Flame, One infinite God, One infinite Love*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 120. The woman is technically a harlot.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Truly the poet has here refined the dross and poured out before us the
glittering metal. Yet what a difference he makes between the two great
world forces: the love of man for a good woman, and the love of man for a
bad woman; the first is supreme, yet the other is far from being infernal.
Listen:

              Yes. A good woman's love will forge a chain
                     To break the spirit of the bravest Greek;
              While with an harlot one may leap again
              Free as the waters of the western main,
                     And turn with no heart-pang the vessel's beak
                     Out to the oceans that all seamen seek."*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 121.

Another, this time a weird, charming little picture of a lewd little mistress
with "a generous baby soul," we include here; for such a one at any rate is
not a true prostitute, rather a poor deluded girl, yearning to love and be
loved, romantic and foolish, yet kindhearted and charitable to a fault: often
the plaything of man, and oftener the means of livelihood of some bad
woman. As Jenny wrapped in "the homage of the dim boudoir," was Nina;
one of that large flotsam of fragile girlhood which forms the better drift of
vice, the first to be swallowed in the social Maelstrom.

              Yes: Nina was a thing of nought,
              A little laughing lewd gamine,
              Idle and vicious, void of thought,
              Easy, impertinent, unclean--
              Utterly charming! Yes, my queen!
              She had a generous baby soul,
              Prattled of love. Should I control,
              Repress, perhaps, the best instinct
              The child had ever had? I winked
              At foolish neighbours, did not shirk.
              Such café Turc I made her drink
              As she had never had had before;
              Set her where you are sitting; chatted;
              Found where the fires of laughter lurk;
              Played with her hair, tangled and matted;
              Fell over strict nice conduct's brink,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              Gave all she would, and something more.
              She was an honest little thing,
              Gave of her best, asked no response.
              What more could Heaven's immortal King
              Censed with innumerous orisons?*

*The Star and the Garter, vol. iii, p. 10. Nina is not a prostitute, of course, in the
commercial sense.

What more indeed! Nina is charming, and we wish we could say the same of
many a Society dame who holds her breath each time she passes such a one.

We have by now certainly slightly diverged from True Love, let us now
enter those enchanting realms of Free Love, which is True Love in its truest
form. Nina is our guide, pointing us out the hill-top road which will lead us
above the social plain, and awed by the mystic love of woman,

              Racing and maddening from the crown of flame,
              The monolithic core of mystical
              Red fury that is called a woman's heart.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 232.

Enter the sphere of Free Love, and sit by the side of Alice, look into the
depth of her eyes, the depths of her heart.

       As a seeker sees the gold
       In the shadow of the stream;

see there her love,

       As a diver sees the pearl
       In the shadow of the sea;

and murmur not above our breath

              Ah! you can love, true girl,
              And is your love for me?*

*The Three Shadows, Rossetti.

"Alice, an Adultery." As golden a book of poetry as Mademoiselle de
Maupin is of prose.

The first poem in the book is called "Messaline."*1. It is in a way a
foreword to the ensuing sonnet-sequence, and yet in a way it is not, its spirit
being more essentially of Lust; for whatever the "unco gude" may say, that
of Alice and her lover is not. To adulterate is to debase; but there is no
debasement here. Love burns pure as a flame, and if it is, as it is here,
between a married woman and a lover who is not her legal husband, so much
deeper the lesson, so much vaster the love; defying all for its own sake: and
here, as we shall see in the end, sacrifices itself, so as not to tarnish the
names of innocent children, which the old harridan Society would otherwise
have besmirched with her foul saliva. In "Messaline" we however have, as
the poet says "leprous entanglements of sense"; here is a magnificent
passage heated with passion and not a little lust:

               Breast to great breast and thigh to thigh,
               We look, and strain, and laugh, and die.
               I see the head hovering above
               To swoop for cruelty or love;
               I feel the swollen veins below
               The knotted throat, the ebb and flow
               Of blood, not milk, in breasts of fire;
               Of deaths, not fluctuants, of desire;
               Of molten lava that abides
               Deep in the vast volcanic sides;
               Deep scars where kisses once bit in
               Below young mountains that be twin,
               Stigmata cruciform of sin,
               The diary of Messaline.*

*1. In the second edition, the first edition began with White Poppy.
*2. Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 63.

A little further on ­ before the sonnets commence ­ another poem greets our
gaze and charms our senses, it is called "Margaret":

               The moon spans Heaven's architrave;
                       Stars in the deep are set;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Written in gold on the day's grave,
                      "To love, and to forget";
             And sea-winds whisper o'er the wave
                      The name of Margaret.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 63.

In these two short poems we have the spirit of Alice offered us, passionate
and sublime; a harmonious blending of Messaline and Margaret in the form
of one sweet woman.

In none of the sonnets can it be said that there is a single scene of lechery.
True we shall have our Buchanans and their ilk, and we still have Rossetti's
poems with one of his finest sonnets excised to please Mrs. Grundy; but
matters it what the sewer-rat thinks of the linnet's songs? leave him in his
dank drain, for we need him not, neither his opinions.

There is a great lesson embodied in this poem. The lesson that Love is only
worthy its hallowed name, when free; that it is only worth having when
freely given, and worth keeping when freely held, without bond or writ. This
freedom we find in the very first sonnet:

             Against the fiat of that God discrowned,
                      Unseated by Man's Justice, and replaced
                      By Law most bountiful and maiden-faced
             And Mother-minded: passing the low bound
             Of Man's poor law we leapt at last and found
                      Passion; and passing the dim halls disgraced
                      Found higher love and larger and more chaste,
             A calm sphinx waiting in secluded ground.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 64.

The first day of meeting he gazes on her, and wonders whether Fate had
found at last a woman's love for him; hopelessly he turns away and sinks the
dream of his soul in despair and "Kindled a corpse-light and proclaimed
`The day!'"

             Thither I fled, busied myself with these;
                      When ­ lo! I saw her shadow following!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                      In every cosmic season-tide of spring
             She rose, being the spring: in utter peace
                      She was with me and in me: thus I saw
                      Ours was not love, but destiny, and law.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 65.

Such is True Love, whether it be the love of a virgin, a harlot, or a wife. No
man-made law, no convention, no ceremony can create it; for it is
spontaneous, anarchic; few are its children, and still fewer its warriors. All
that this lover sees breathes "Alice"; all that he hears reverberates with her
name; all that he smells holds the clinging scent of her hair, Alice, Alice,
Alice! He feels she is beyond him; yet in his ear whispers the Master; whose
power is rapture.

             I drew a hideous talisman of lust
                      In many colours where strong sigils shone;
                      Crook'd mystic language of oblivion,
             Fitted to crack and scorch the terrene crust
             And bring the sulphur steaming from the thrust
                      Of Satan's winepress, was ill written on
                      The accurséd margin, and the orison
             Scrawled backwards, as a bad magician must.

             By these vile tricks, abominable spells,
                      I drew foul horrors from a many hells--
                      Though I had fathomed Fate; though I had seen
             Chastity charm-proof arm and sea gray eyes
                      And sweet clean body of my spirit's queen,
                      Where nothing dwells that God did not devise.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 66.

The sonnets relating the events of the seventh to the tenth day are dismal,
attempting to drown Love in Lust. On the twelfth a little flame burns up,
then comes the poem, which Alice receives and reads. Every verse is as
charming, simple, and fascinating as the following two:

             One kiss, like snow, to slip,
             Cool fragrance from thy lip
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                      To melt on mine;
             One kiss, a white-sail ship
             To laugh and leap and dip
                      Her brows divine; .
             One kiss, a starbeam faint
             With love of a sweet saint,
             Stolen like a sacrament
                      In the night's shrine!

             One kiss, like moonlight cold,
             Lighting with floral gold
                      The lake's low tune;
             One kiss, one flower to fold,
             On its own calyx rolled
                      At night, in June!
             One kiss, like dewfall, drawn
             A veil o'er leaf and lawn--
             Mix night, and noon, and dawn,
                      Dew, flower, and moon!*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 69.

That Alice was charmed, that the above was a love-philtre, the thirteenth day
discloses ­ the birthday of their first kiss:

             Breasts met and arms enclosed, and all the spring
             Grew into summer with the first long kiss.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 70.

They are henceforth lovers, passionate and ardent; and not till now do they
discover that man-made honour is but as winter snow. All is hence Alice, as
is shown in that sweet and simple song which bears her name:

             The stars are hidden in dark and mist,
                      The moon and sun are dead,
             Because my love has caught and kissed
                      My body in her bed.
             No light may shine this happy night--
             Unless my Alice be the light.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              .   .    .     .    .  . .  .    .    .  .    .   .
              This night shall never be withdrawn--
              Unless my Alice be the dawn.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 71.

Yet Alice is full of fear; they question their love, and Love conquers. The
still horror creeps silently on, enveloping them in the shroud that man has
woven as the garment of love:

              Since our pure shame unworthily destroys
              The love of all she had, her girls and boys,
                      Her home, their lives: and yet my whisper stirs
                      Into live flame her passion, and deters
              Her fear from spurning all the day's due joys.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 73.

The pudibonderie of the English would call this lust. Indeed, drunken on
their own crapulous imagination, choked by their venomous vomit, they
cannot see the divine form of Love through the mist of their steaming
sensuality. For what reason did man tie woman to him? For what reason did
he devise the horrors of indissoluble marriage? And the answer is: that he
might ever have at least one poor victim to sate his vile carnalities on. Lust
and Indolence are the parents of Marriage and Law, but not even the menials
of Freedom and Free Love.

                      We clung still closer, till the soul ran through
              Body to body, twined like sunny snakes,
              Sinlessly knowing we were man and wife.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 73.

Alice, still fearful, foresees the end; such love as theirs is too supernal to be
platonic; she flies in vain; for she has to console her sad lover with the truth.
The storm-clouds gather on the twenty-fifth day:

                      Mouth unto mouth! O fairest! mutely lying,
              Fire lambent laid on water ­ O! the pain!
                      Kiss me, O heart, as if we both were dying!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              Kiss, as we could not ever kiss again!
              Kiss me, between the music of our sighing,
                      Lightning and rain!*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 76.

A curious conflict this `twixt love and fear, "honour and lust, and truth and
trust beguiled"; they wandered in the scented garden of man's heart, and all
their restraint was as ephemeral as the fleeting hour. "And when the woman
saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and
a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did
eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat." (N.B. --
Husband: neither church nor registry office is mentioned!)

              Linked in the tiny shelf upon the ship,
                      My blind eyes burned into her mild ones: limbs
                      Twined to each other while fine dew bedims
              Their quivering skins: lip fastened unto lip:
              Whole soul and body frenzied meet and clip;
                      And the breath staggers, and the life-blood swims!
                      Terrible gods chant black demoniac hymns
              As the frail cords of honour strain and slip.

              For in the midst of that tremendous tide
                      The mighty vigour of a god was mine!
                      Drunk with desire, her lamentations died.
              The dove gave place a moment to the swine!
                      Rapturous draughts of madness! Out she sighed
                      Uttermost life's love, and became a bride*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 77. "Many sins are forgiven this woman because she hath
loved much."

Not like Adam and Eve, however, did they then discover that they were
naked, such epilogues being more especially suited to the author of "Lot and
his Daughters" and "The Concubine of Gibeah," than the author of
"Tannhäuser" or "Alice." Nevertheless reproach followed, if shame did not,
the celebration of love's mystic eucharist. Reproach rises, but falls
enamoured to his kisses; all is extremes, there is no heaviness, no deadness
of sentiment, the smoke curls as high as the flashing flames, and tears wash
_____________________________________________________________________________________
out smiles, and blushing cheeks dry tears; all is effluent glory, glorious as a
Sun of gold lingering on the blushing bosom of Dawn:

              We lay in naked chastity, caressed
              Child-like or dreaming, till the dawn repressed
              Our sighs: that nuptial yet hath never ceased.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 79.

Still the future rises up before them, as a serpent, "prescience of next year";
the Minotaur, "prodigious offspring of the fatal graft?" But the present is a
sublime kiss, and the future as hollow as the emblem of two parted lips,
"while love was hovering and our lips were fain?" Soon the parting draws
nigh, he attempts to detain her; but he knows he must inevitably fail, as he
knew his first kiss must inevitably lead to their great love and surrender.
They spend the last melancholy day together:

              Strong kisses that had surfeited a score
              Of earthly bridals in an hour we squandered.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 84.

And at last:

                                  THE FIFTIETH DAY

              At noon she sailed for home, a weeping bride
                      Widowed before the honeymoon was done.
                      Always before the rising of the sun
              I swore to come in spirit to her side
              And lie like love; and she at eventide
                      Swore to seek me and gather one by one
                      The threads of labyrinthine love new spun,
              Cretan for monstrous shadows serpent-eyed.

              So the last kiss passed like a poison-pain,
                      Knowing we might not ever kiss again.
                      Mad tears fell fast: "Next year!" in cruel distress
              We sobbed and stretched our arms out, and despaired,
                      And ­ parted. Out the brute-side of truth flared;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                      "Thank God I've finished with that foolishness!"*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 84.

This last line is almost staggering, but such a cruel truth is soon given the
lie: "I am a fool, tossing a coin with Fate," says he; and again, "I love you,
and shall love you till I die." "I love you, and shall love you all my life." "I
love you and shall love you after death." This is the Higher Love; and so
ends one of the greatest poems of true and pure love ever written, musical as
the breath of stormy Aeolus. Fascinated we read its verses again and again,
dazzled with their mystic beauty, their harmony, and, above all, their intense
human love. As the Editor says, those who fail to find religion in such
poems must indeed be idiots, idiots who would bowdlerize Shakespeare,
Shelley, and Browning. Neither was their love a mere selfish gratification of
the senses. Anxiously they waited to see "whether the mother stood behind
the bride," falteringly he would not part with her till she held the key of the
hereafter"; and ultimately they resigned all for the sake of others:

             Even while I begged her, I well knew she must.
                      We could not, loving to see children laugh,
             Let cowards twit them with their mother's lust.
             Even our own purity confirmed the trust.
             How long, O Lord, how long? Too long by half
             Till men read, wondering, wedlock's epitaph.*

*Alice, an Adultery, vol. ii, p. 82.

Aleister Crowley is but editor* of these magnificent sonnets; let us now see
how the ideas in his own poems correspond.

*The authorship, however, is acknowledged in vol. ii, which was published after this
chapter was written.

In the case of Nina, we have already seen that a good heart can throb in a
lewd little breast, and can overcome all except a false society; which
overwhelms it not by bravery, or craft, or even by cunning, but by the dull
and stunning power of a leaden club. In the "Honourable Adulterers" we
find a poem strikingly reminiscent of "Alice," a boundless, and what
Ydgrunites would call "an illicit love," but more, a well-aimed shaft against
the horrors of the social marriage tie, which is denominated as "The devilish
_____________________________________________________________________________________
circle of the fiery ring," which, as their love grew, "Became one moment
like a little thing."

If I am right, the heart of this poem bleeds generous indignation against the
marriage bond. We read:

                 It was no wonder when the second day
                 Showed me a city on the desert way,
                         Whose brazen gates were open, where within
                         I saw a statue for a sign of sin,
                 And saw the people come to it and pray,
                         Before its mouth set open for a gin.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 99.

Before this statue he is brought; her bronze and chilly loins are girded with
the sacred gold of lust, her lips are lecherous and large, inviting to kiss:

                 But somehow blood was black upon them; blood
                 In stains and clots and splashes; and the mud
                 Trampled around her by the souls that knelt,
                 Worshipping where her false lewd body dwelt,
                 Was dark and hateful; and a sleepy flood
                 Trickled therefrom as magic gums that melt.*1.
                 .    .   .  .   .   .   .    .    .  .   .  .   .
                 I am a man, nor fear to drain the bowl.*2.
                 .    .   .  .   .   .   .    .    .  .   .  .   .
                 Now some old devil, dead no doubt and damned,
                 But living in her life, had wisely crammed
                         Her fierce bronze throat with such a foul device
                         As made her belly yearn for sacrifice.
                 She leered like love on me, and smiled, and shammed,
                         And did not pity for all her breast of spice.*3.

Man though he was, he is thrust into her Moloch arms. When lo! a miracle!
he is plucked by his own fearlessness from the horrid maw, "Free, where the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
blood of other men is wet," mingling in life till "ten thousand little loves
were brought to birth"; then came the one woman who looked so deeply in
his eyes till hers grew, shielding the sun, as a purple ring:

              Then in the uttermost profound I saw
              The veil of Love's unalterable law
                     Lifted, and in the shadow far behind
                     Dim and divine, within the shadow blind
              My own love's face most amorously draw
                     Out of the deep toward my cloudy mind.

              O suddenly I felt a kiss enclose
              My whole live body, as a rich red rose
                     Folding its sweetness round the honey-bee!
                     I felt a perfect soul embracing me,
              And in my spirit like a river flows
                     A passion like the passion of the sea.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic. vol. i, p. 100.

So ends the first part of this mystical and symbolic poem, In the second part
the Queen speaks, her love is similar to that of "Alice," if not sublimer: "I
was so glad he loved enough to go" ­ "my arms could never have released
his neck." The King dies and soon the Queen also. Love is symbolized in
this poem in its higher form as above death. She seeks and finds "There is no
sin."

              And I? I knew not anything, but know
              We are still silent, and united so,
              And all our being spells one vast To Be,
              A passion like the passion of the sea.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic. vol. i, p. 101.

Besides the freedom of lovers, Aleister Crowley advocates the freedom of
the children of love; he does not visit the sins of the fathers on the children,
as conventionality cruelly does. Though he is a firm believer in the chain of
cause and effect as is strongly shown in "The Mother's Tragedy," he does
not carry it further into the realms of Biblical vice. The children of what is
known as an illicit love ­ which in most cases is true free love ­ have time

after time proved themselves better and greater than those engendered in the
unimpassioned embrace of the marriage-bed. Shakespeare brings this point
out forcibly in King Lear, when Edmund speaks as follows:

                                  ...why brand they us
              With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
              Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
              More composition and fierce quality
              Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
              Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
              Got `tween asleep and wake?

In "Jephthah" we find an almost identical rendering of the above, concerning
the children of free love:

              Turn not thy face from us in wrath, for we
              Are thine own father's children, and his loins
              With double fervour gat a double flower;
              And we indeed were born of drudging wives,
              Pale spouses whom his heart despised, but thou
              Wast of a fairer face and brighter eyes,
              And limbs more amorous assuaged thy sire;
              And fuller blood of his is tingling thus
              Now in thy veins indignant at our sin.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, pp. 70, 71.

Thus we find free love is the great, pure, and only true love. Its name has
been soiled and fouled by the feculencies of Holywell Street, its celebration
misunderstood and prostituted by the Church, and its life threatened and
blackguardized by the Law. But wherever two hearts beat in unison, there is
its abode, North or South, East or West, it knows no locality, no time, no
space; for it is love sublime, eternal, inscrutable; its greatest foe is Lust, and
the most fearful form of lust is Marriage: Whom God hath joined let no man
put asunder.

We have already seen marriage described in "The Honourable Adulterers"
and in "The Star and the Garter"; we get a pregnant glimpse of it again in the
one speech, "A bargain's a bargain, a thousand a year and a flat in Mayfair
are better than Farmer Tyson's butter and eggs."*1. In these few words are
_____________________________________________________________________________________
practically summed up the raison d'être of all mariages de convenance. The
affluent marry out of sensuality, or to engender sons to inherit their
selfishness, the middle orders trot their daughters round the London ball-
rooms just as strumpets fall in to the cry of descendez, mesdemoiselles!
Women marry for title, clothing, shelter, and food; men because they think it
is cheaper to keep a cow, and once and for all have done with it, than to be
constantly running round the corner for a penny-worth of milk; and the
lower stratum ­ the blesséd poor ­ spend most of their lives in the act of
engendering the elite of heaven and the scum of this earth, "mere shells,
husks of the golden wheat that might grow even here,"*2. if it were not for
our prudery, our religion, and our laws.

*1. Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 42.
*2. The Poem, vol., i, p. 57.

Percy ­ the Percy of "The Poem," and not of "Why Jesus Wept," is
optimistic enough concerning that vast army of unsexed women who are
degraded by want of food and surfeit of marriage; for it is to these two that
their existence as such is chiefly due. If wives were a success, man would
not want to go neighing after other women; if food were not so expensive,
women would not sell their bodies for offal. Vaughan says to him, pointing
to a prostitute, "Do you find beauty in her?" to which Percy answers: "No,
but I see in her history a poem, to which I trust that God will write an end!"*
And so the God, who is eternal Love at present does ­ in the Lock Hospital
or over Waterloo Bridge. Nevertheless there is a great truth hidden in this
line. The truth that love shall triumph over mind, or rather that both shall
agree. If the carnal act is foul, it is then as foul in the palace as in the brothel:
mere prostitution of the body need not necessarily mean a similar
prostitution of the mind, as we saw in the "Tale of Archais." Every woman's
body is as free a possession of her own as that of every man is of his own,
and what is disgraceful to woman is equally disgraceful to man, and vice
versâ. Law to be true must be just, and as long as man wages war against
woman for sins that he condones in himself, so long will vice reign supreme,
so long will women prove themselves deceivers, harpyiæ and sirenes, let
alone Eumenides. Most will recognize the following as the opening scene in
Terence's "The Mother-in-Law," which play sums up the matter tersely
enough:

*The Poem, vol., i, p. 58.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              Philotis. I' faith, Syra, you can find but very few lovers who
        prove constant to their mistresses. For instance, how often did this
        Pamphilus swear to Bacchis ­ how solemnly, so that anyone might
        have believed him ­ that he never would take home a wife so long as
        she lived. Well now, he is married.
              Syra. Therefore for that very reason, I earnestly both advise and
        entreat you to take pity upon no one, but plunder, fleece, and rend
        every man you lay hold of.
              Philotis. What! Hold no one exempt?
              Syra. No one; for not a single one of them, rest assured, comes
        to you without making up his mind, by means of his flatteries, to
        gratify his passion with you at the least possible expense. Will you
        not, pray, plot against them in return?
              Philotis. And yet, upon my faith, it is unfair to be the same to
        all.
              Syra. What! unfair to take revenge on your enemies? or for
        them to be caught in the very way they try to catch you? Alas!
        wretched me! why do not your age and beauty belong to me, or else
        these sentiments of mine to you?

So long as we mentally castrate ourselves, so long will this world remain a
stew-pot of vice; for it is only when we have realized the ideal of Free Love,
and have taken the matrix of prostitution and cut from it the gem which
underlies all its gross vulgarity and sensuality, that we shall become initiates
in the code of the Essential and ameliorate our lot. To this poem indeed we
trust, that God will write a fitting end.

If at one end of a sequence we find abuse, then at the other extremity we
shall inevitably discover disuse; polarity is universal; hot, cold; good, bad,
etc. This duality is in reality only apparent, there being no definite line of
division. So in Love, if one system of Ethics tends towards abuse, then we
may be certain that the reverse will be uselessly sterile, and that the only
possible system to follow will as usual lie directly between these extremes,
and in this case, in the region of Use. If now, supposing at one end of our
pole we find Lust seated crimson as a rose, then at the other we shall find
Chastity white as a lily.

This system of extremes has during the world's history exerted an
overwhelming force on the will of man. Beholding a satyr he worshipped a
virgin; feeling the ills of the flesh, he conceived the bliss of the soul. This
_____________________________________________________________________________________
diametric opposition, verging ever towards the extreme circumference of
utility, has given and is giving birth to numerous world-wide systems and
philosophies.

The taboos of the South Seas, the restrictions laid on widow-remarriage in
India, the purdah of the Mussulman, the veil of the Vestal, the numerous
accounts of Virgin-mothers, all find their origin in this idea. The laws of the
Vedas, of Manu, of Buddha, the codes of Confucius and Lao-Tze, the
Talmudic books of the Jews, and the Koran of the Mohamedans, all maintain
its direct influence and restrictions; and in the West in the old mythologies
of Teuton and Celt, in the old Norse sagas, more so in the Roman and
Grecian law, and still more so on the Christian edicts of Constantine,
Theodoric, Athalaric, and Justinian, and the innumerable codes of the
Middle Ages: all of which growing one into the other have produced that
truly revolting state of affairs belting the world with Lust. As every one of us
has been bred on dead flesh, so every one of us passes along our way
spiritually encumbered with the dead bones of our ancestors' opinions; and
living with them we die, only to add more mental tibias and spiritual
metatarsals to the groaning back of the future.

In the Kingdom of Love these extremes gave birth to two forces, "Neronic
Lust" and "Platonic Affection." From a heterogeneous mass of ics, ists, and
ians, sprang the idea that there was an inherent evil in the culmination of the
nuptial state; and out of it grew the preying vampirism of Paul. `This
inherent evil supposed to lie latent in matter, as opposed to the bliss of spirit,
Crowley sets forth very forcibly in several of his poems. In "The Growth of
God" we have most of the argument in the following lines:

              The Shapeless, racked with agony, that grew
                     Into these phantom forms that change and shatter;
              The falling of the first toad-spotted dew;
                     The first lewd heaving ecstasy of matter.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 178.

The idea grows still more powerfully in the next verse:

              I see all Nature claw and tear and bite,
                     All hateful love and hideous: and the brood
              Misshapen, misbegotten out of spite;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                       Lust after death; love in decrepitude.
             Thus, till the monster-birth of serpent-man
                       Linked in corruption with the serpent-woman,
             Slavering in lust and pain ­ creation's ban.
                       The horrible beginning of the human.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 198. (Also Tale of Archais.)

In Tannhäuser, which is an intensely psychologic drama, we find the Knight
speaking thus to Venus:

             Ah, if pure love could grow material!
             There are pure women!

and this is her answer:

                                    There you make me laugh!
             Remember ­ I have known such. But besides
             You ask hot snow and leaden feather-flights!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 237.

Which contains a great truth, namely, that platonic love is no love at all. An
affection it may be, but love it cannot be if it dare not see its form mirrored
in the eyes of a loving woman. Its failure in the end is a certainty; certain
ascetics may compel their wills to conquer their natures, but men as a whole
cannot. Certain maniacs such as Origen may emasculate themselves for the
Kingdom of God, but the great human masses will let the Kingdom of God
go to the Devil, if a pretty pair of lips is in question. Not for long in any case
can we change our natures, as the anchorites of the Libyan deserts only too
fearfully proved; boiling with carnalities they feared to see their own
mothers, and were even forbidden to keep in their possession animals of the
female sex ­ O Stylites! they are now in heaven!

             How we clave together! How we strained caresses!
             How the swooning limbs sank fainting on the sward!
             For the fiery dart raged fiercer; in excesses
             Long restrained, it cried, "Behold I am the Lord!"*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 173.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Such is the ultimate end of platonic love. That it has many noble forms, that
it sprang from the true abhorrence of the vile, cannot be denied; that its field
of combat is an Aceldama, all this is true enough:

                                            ...whose red banners beat
                      Their radiant fire
             Into my shrivelled head, to wither Love's desire?*

*Aceldama, vol. i, p. 2.

but that it must die on the field of its choice is also most certain.

In "The Nameless Quest" and "Tannhäuser," we find represented this
striving after a more spiritual and platonic ideal of love. In the former,
questing for the ideal of his hopes, man falls tangled into the arms of the
real; in the latter, entangled, he strives to tear away the meshes of his
passion, and at length succeeds in releasing himself from the magic threads.

In "The Nameless Quest," Gereth is in love with the Queen, and the King
calls on a knight to go on the Nameless Quest to a certain pillar which lies at
the end of the road which leads from Human desire to Divine contentment;
around it lie the bones of the "questing slain" unburied, unremembered,
unconfessed; Gereth's name is cried aloud, and the King bids him God-
speed, girding on him his own true sword, whilst the Queen draws from her
finger a ring and places it on his. Then when he has left their presence he
notices for the first time:

             There was no jewel in the ring she gave!

for it was the emblem of her total surrender:

             Oh my pure heart! Adulterous love began
             So subtly to identify the man
             With its own perfumed thoughts. So steals the grape
             Into the furtive brain ­ a spirit shape
             Kisses my spirit as no woman can.
             I love her ­ yes; and I have no escape.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 188.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
On the Quest he goes, ever tormented by the cry of the inner self, ever
striving to overcome it.

                 Again the curséd cry: "What quest is this?"
                 Is it worth heaven in thy lover's kiss?
                 A queen, a queen, to kiss and never tire!
                 Thy queen, quick-breathing for your twin desire!"
                 I shudder, for the mystery of bliss;
                 I go, heart crying and a soul on fire!*1.
                 .    .   .   .  .   .   .   .   .   .   . .  .
                 Still, I stepped onward. Credit me so far!
                 The harlot had my soul: my will, the star!
                 Thus I went onward, as a man goes blind,
                 Into a torrent crowd of mine own kind;
                 Jostlers and hurried folk, and mad they are,
                 A million actions and a single mind.*2.

*1. The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 188.
*2. Ibid. vol. i, p. 189.

As he proceeds along his weary path, he feels a strengthening within him of
the higher self, struggling against his desire, again and again every nerve in
him cries, "halt": at last he reaches the land of lost ideals:

                 The plain is covered with a many dead.
                 Glisten white bone and salt-encrusted head,
                 Glazed eye imagined, of a crystal built.
                 And see! dark patches, as of murder spilt.
                 Ugh! "So my fellows of the quest are sped!
                 Thou shalt be with them: onward, if thou wilt!"*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 190.

He sees in the distance the pillar:

                                     Quaintly shaped and hued,
                 It focussed all the sky and all the plain
                 To its own ugliness...*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.

and yet as he looked again he saw it in another form:

             A shapeless truth took image in my brain.

Then from the centre of Eternity came a voice, "Tell thou the secret of the
pillar." "Eternal Beauty, One and absolute!" flashes from his tongue. Again
the voice asks, "Thou knowest me for Beauty! Canst thou bear the fuller
vision?"

             Then on my withered gaze that Beauty grew-
             Rosy quintessence of alchemic dew!
             The Self-informing Beauty! In my heart
             The many were united: and I knew.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.

And yet:

                                                     I was wed
             Unto the part and could not grasp the whole.

             Thus, I was broken on the wheel of Truth.
             Fled all the hope and purpose of my youth,
             The high desire, the secret joy, the sin
             That coiled its rainbow dragon scales within.
             Hope's being, life's delight, time's eager tooth;
             All, all are gone; the serpent sloughs his skin!

             The quest is mine! Here ends mortality
             In contemplating the eternal Thee.
             Here, She is willing. Stands the Absolute
             Reaching its arms toward me. I am mute,
             I draw toward. Oh, suddenly I see
             The treason-pledge, the royal prostitute.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 191.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thus does he fail at the very threshold of his higher self. He hears echoing
"Gereth, I am thine!" And falling back on his purpose, the illusions of spirit
and mind dissolve to the desolate cry of "Unready." Haggard and worn, back
to the court he wends his weary way, back to the King, back to his self's
desire; and there, taunted by the husband of the mistress he had denied
himself in vain, stung with insult and vile word, he slays him:

              Stark dead. The queen ­ I hate the name of her!
              So grew the mustard-seed, one moment's lust.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 192.

Wounded himself, he is nursed back to life by the wife of his adversary.

              Ah God! she won that most reluctant breath
              Out of corruption: love! ah! love is strong!
              What waters quench it? King Shalomeh saith.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 192.

Thus failed the Quest, as all quests against love must inevitably fail. A man
who truly loves a woman loves her so intensely that all else is as naught; she
grows before him gigantic through the mist of his desire, swallowing him up
in the affinity of her being. The King's sword was of little use; the pillar of
the Higher Self lay in the salt-encrusted plains, saline with the tears and sobs
of failure; the ring emblematic of surrender, without beginning or end, was
emblematic also of the eternality of love, that circling girdle of the world.

In "Tannhäuser" we have a similar idea, though reversed; for Tannhäuser
enmeshed in the web of the Venusberg, strives against the sensual to gain a
spiritual victory; whilst in "The Nameless Quest" the knight, fearful of
falling in the sensual slough, seeks, and loses his straight way in the spiritual
desert. Thus, as in the latter case, the striving against the desire of a pure
love leads to an almost certain failure, so in the former, when sunk deep in
the mud of an impure affection, even if released from its circling arms,
worldly mercy is as cold to him who has plunged through the Cytherean sea
as a winter in Gaul. Thus Ignorance has bound, fettered, and manacled love
to the dingy fornices of the lupanar. Once sink, and instead of extending a
helping hand, your head is thrust for a second and third time beneath the
waters of affliction by the hands of lechers and louts.

The drama entitled "Tannhäuser" is (as the author states in his preface)
almost identical with "The Pilgrim's Progress." It is an intricate mass of
psychology and philosophy closely interwoven with a moral ­ which we
shall see more fully developed when touching upon the philosophy of
Aleister Crowley ­ and it is this: that Happiness, Wisdom, Knowledge, and
at length Perfection, can no more be gained by solely travelling along the
direct and spotless road of Virtue, than man can be evolved from the primal
protoplasmic jelly without countless generations of weeping and tortured
life. The path of Vice we must tread before we can find the high road of
Virtue, and Vice we must wed before we can open the gates of a more
perfect understanding. The great Commandment is: "Live in the midst of
Vice; but heed that Vice doth not live in thy midst."*

*Vide Hosea.

"God is the Complex and the Protoplast." And so are we; entwined within
us, as in the poem of Tannhäuser, lie the countless threads of inherited
tendencies. To suspend our soul on one alone leads only to utter destruction;
to climb to heaven we must grasp the whole tangled skein of our experiences
and mount from Malkuth to Kether through the gates of Knowledge,
Wisdom, and Understanding. That we shall be pestered on our way by
swarms of human blow-flies, that we shall tread on the scorpions of religion,
the toads of society, and the blind-worms of the law; that around us will
whirl the vampires of the past, the kites of the present, the succubi of the
future, is certain enough; as a shrieking mass of hideous animosity they will
conglobe around us, deafening us with the expletives of earth, blinding us
with the fumes of hell, and rendering us insane with the inanities of heaven:

              This were my guerdon: to fade utterly
                       Into the rose-heart of that sanguine vase,
              And lose my purpose in its silent sea,
                       And lose my life, and find my life, and pass
                       Up to the sea that is as molten glass.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 227.

Nirvana. The drowning of self in eternity. Yet if the mind returned not from
its abode, and ever rested with God, all would run smoothly enough; but
such a possibility is too transcendental to be actual. If it were,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Then this dull house of gold and iron and clay
             Is happy also ­ `tis an easy way!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 227.

But this cannot be. The dice are in God's lap, and in him alone rests the
Ultimate goal. In "Tannhäuser" we find the great dual power of redemption,
the interminglings of the powers of Virtue and Vice. In him, as in the hero of
"The Nameless Quest," they wage an eternal contest, it not being till he has
passed through the Venusberg of mental and physical lust, that he attains the
graal of his hopes and aspirations:

             O God, Thy blinding beauty, and the light
             Shed from Thy shoulders, and the golden night
             Of mingling fire, and stars and roses swart
             In the long flame of hair that leaps athwart,
             Live in each tingling gossamer! Dread eyes!
             Each flings its arrow of sharp sacrifice,
             Eating me up with poison! I am hurled
             Far through the vaporous confines of the world
             With agony of sundering sense, beholding
             Thy mighty flower, blood-colored death, unfolding!
             Lithe limbs and supple shoulders and lips curled,
             Curled out to draw me to their monstrous world!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 228.

Tannhäuser now enters the palace of the great queen Venus, the false Isis,

             Life! Life! This Kiss! Draw in thy breath! To me!
             To me!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 229.

He is lost!

Act II opens with two beautiful songs. Venus sings the praise of spring and
summer, and Tannhäuser that of autumn and winter. He finds the latter chill
season the best:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              But best is grim December,
                       The Goatish God his power;
              The Satyr blows the ember,
                       And pain is passion's flower;
              When blood drips over kisses,
                       And madness sobs through wine--
                       Ah mine!--
              The snake starts up and hisses
                       And strikes and ­ I am thine!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 230.

In the above we still find the now almost dead echo of his higher self, yet
Venus entices him on, comparing their fierce lust to the lukewarm affection
of those little lovers who strip their maidens bare, "And find them ­ naked!
Poor and pitiful!" directly the glamour of their foolish honeymoon has
tarnished. His uneasiness is soon dispelled: "Come, in this sweet
abandonment of self" ­ whispers the singing voice of Venus, and so
following he sings:

              Come, love, and kiss my shoulders! Sleepy lies
              The tinted bosom whence its fire flies,
              The breathing life of thee, and swoons, and sighs,
              And dies!
              None but the dead can know the worth of love!
              .    .    .   .  .   .  .    .  .   .  .  .  .
              Come, love, thy lips, curved hollow as the moon's!
              Bring me thy kisses, for the seawind tunes,
              The song that soars, and reads the starry runes,
              And swoons!
              None but the dead can tune the lyre of love!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 234.

Such are two out of these six superb lyrical verses.

Tannhäuser sleeps. "None but the dead can know the worth of love!" None
but the dead, dead to all else. To love is to die and be born again in another
world, to slough the skin of the terrene and be robed in all the supernal glory
_____________________________________________________________________________________
of the celestial. Love changes as Death, it effaces the past, it brightens the
future, beautifies as the hand of some mystic artist, all misery, all sorrow, all
woe, overwhelming, illimitable.

Now we see the horrid form of his lower self, which he once strove to cast
off, bending over him; the Venus of his body rises lecherous over the pure
Isis of his soul, the carnal lusting over the Spiritual, as Iago slavered over
Desdemona.

             Come! ye my serpents, warp his body round
             With your entangling leprosy! And me,
             Let me assume the belovéd limber shape,
             The crested head, the jewelled eyes of death,
             And sinuous sinewy glitter of serpenthood,
             That I may look once more into his face,
             And, kissing, kill him! Thus to hold him fast,
             Drawing his human spirit into mine
             For strength, for life, for poison! Ah, my God!
             These pangs, these torments! See! the sleeper wakes!
             I am triumphant! For he reaches out
             The sleepy arms, and turns the drowsy head
             To catch the dew dissolving of my lip.
             Wake, lover, wake! Thy Venus waits for thee!
             Draw back, look, hunger! --and thy mouth is mine!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i. p. 234.

The vision of Elizabeth, the loved one of his boyhood ­ his pure ideal ­ rises
before him.

                                  ...so delicate and frail,
             Far, white, and lonely as the coldest star
             Set beyond gaze of any eye but God's.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i. p. 236.

And he tells Venus of her. To which she answers:

                                  Thine old desire
             Was just to touch the mere impalpable.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             To formulate the formless...*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i. p. 237.

Again Tannhäuser bursts into song, one of those magnificent lyrics, flashing
like a ruby, warm and flaming in the glowing gold of this drama. And thus
does his song end:

             Whose long-drawn curse runs venom in my veins?
                       What dragon spouse consumes me with her breath?
             What passionate hatred, what infernal pains,
                       Mixed with thy being in the womb of Death?
                            Blistering fire runs.
                            Scorching, terrific suns,
             Through body and soul in this abominable
                            Marriage of demon power
                            Subtle and strong and sour,
             A draught of ichor of the veins of Hell!
                            Curses leap leprous, epicene, unclean,
                            The soul of the obscene
             Incarnate in the spirit: and above
                            Hangs Sin, vast vampire, the corrupt, that
                                  swings
                            Her unredeeming wings
             Over the world, and flaps, for lust of Death ­ and Love!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i. p. 239.

"Kill me," cries Tannhäuser. "In the kiss," answers Venus: thus ends Act II.

Act III opens a different scene. The outer materiality of body is all but sated,
the starved soul within cries for sustenance; he murmurs "Elizabeth," and
then wakes strong through her perfection. Venus still entices, but her power
has vanished, and at the name of "Ave Maria!" the exorcism entangled
round the souls of the victims of the Venusberg vanishes in a vast roll of
thunder and amidst the fierce flashes of dazzling lightning which rush
through the leaden sky rending the depths of despair. Tannhäuser is released
from his bondage, and the shackles of lust fall from his soul; he is free, and
kneeling by a Calvary.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Act IV again brings our knight before the gaze of the world. He has eaten of
the tree of the Knowledge of Good and of Evil, and has become as a god. He
wends his way to the Court of the Landgrave and there meets Elizabeth,
"His far-off baby-love," as Venus called her, and whispers to himself,
"Cannot purity be brought to know aught but itself?" Herein lies the note of
his misfortunes. Purity was but ignorance, and Tannhäuser was now a god,
knowing both good and evil:

                                                        Lo!
                 Man is made one with God, an equal soul.
                 For he shall know
                 The harmony, the oneness of the Whole.
                 This was my purpose.
                 .    .  .   .  .  .   .    .  .   .   .   .  .
                 Remains the life of earth, which is but hell,
                 Destiny's web, and my immense despair.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 253.

And this despair ­ as sorrow so frequently does ­ creates in him a deep
cynical disgust for the world:

                 Man, a bad joke; and God, mere epigram!
                 If we must come to that. And likewise love.*1.

                 Only a donkey fastened to a post
                 Moves in a circle.*2.

*1. Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 253.
*2. Ibid, vol. i, p. 254.

He taunts them, insults God; and tells all, shouting it far and broad, that his
road was the road of the Mount of Venus, the road of Lust, the fiery baptism
of Vice which impels Virtue. Then the silence breaks, the foul mob of the
Self-sufficient, the spawn of ignorance, and the slime of superstition, let
loose their hell-hound voices-- fiend! atheist! devil! are hurled at his head;
kill him! Crucify him! death! death! But Tannhäuser stands a colossus amid
the bursting bubbles of this Stygian mire of corruption, and turning to the
Landgrave he says:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                       Will they answer you?
             My arm is weary as your souls are not
             Of beastliness: I have drawn my father's sword.
             Hard as your virtue is the easy sort,
             Heavy to handle as your loves are light,
             Smooth as your lies, and sharper than your hates!
             I know you! Cowards to the very bone!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 257.

And he drives them out. To Rome he goes, symbolic of the world's opinion,
and relates truthfully his sojourn in the Venusberg, and for telling the truth
he is execrated by the Pope:

                                                     So he
             Cried out upon me, "Till this barren staff
             Take life, and bud, and blossom, and bear fruit,
             And shed sweet scent ­ so long God casteth thee
             Out from His Glory!"*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 260.

When lo! ­ in the very moment of his supreme despair, his Genius
mysteriously manifests, and "darting long rugged fingers and deep eyes"
reaches to the sceptre with his word and will:

             Buds, roses, blossoms! Lilies of the Light!
             Bloom, bloom, the fragrance shed upon the air!
             Out flames the miracle of life and love!
             Out, out the lights! Flame, flame, the rushing storm!
             Darkness and death, and glory in my soul!
             Swept, swept away are pope and cardinal,
             Palace and city! There I lay beneath
             The golden roof of the eternal stars,
             Borne upon some irremeable sea
             That glowed with most internal brilliance;*1.
             .     .    .   . . .   .   .   .  .   .   .  .
                                                     And verily
             My life was borne on the dark stream of death
             Down whirling aeons, linked abysses, columns
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Built of essential time. And lo! the light
             Shed from Her shoulders whom I dimly saw;
             Crowned with twelve stars and hornéd as the moon;
             Clothed with a sun to which the sun of earth
             Were tinsel; and the moon was at Her feet--
             A moon whose brilliance breaks the sword of song
             Into a million fragments; so transcends
             Music, that starlight-sandalled majesty!
             Then ­ shall I contemplate the face of Her?
             O Nature! Self-begotten! Spouse of God,
             The Glory of thy Countenance unveiled!
             Thy face, O mother! Splendour of the Gods!
             Behold! amid the glory of her hair
             And light shed over from the crown thereof,
             Wonderful eyes less passionate than Peace
             That wept! That wept! O mystery of Love!
             Clasping my hands upon the scarlet rose
             That flamed upon my bosom, the keen thorns
             Pierced me and slew! My spirit was withdrawn
             Into Her godhead, and my soul made One
             With the Great Sorrow of the Universe,
             The Love of Isis! Then I fell away
             Into some old mysterious abyss
             Rolling between the heights of starry space;
             Flaming above, beyond the Tomb of Time,
             Blending the darkness into the profound
             Chasms of matter ­ so I fell away
             Through many strange eternities of Space,
             Limitless fields of Time...*2.

*1. Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.
*2. Ibid.

Such is the ecstatic rapture of Tannhäuser, in which he loses all perception
of earthly love in the intoxication of the divine:

             Were it not only that the selflessness
             That fills me now, forbids the personal,
             Casts out the individual, and weeps on
             For the united sorrow of all things.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.

And such is the divine love to which we all must attain, "For the united
sorrow of all things."

                          III

                The Chapter known as

                   The Harlot

In which chapter it is related how she decked and be-
 tired her worn carrion, and how she standeth at the
 corners by the parting of the ways, beguiling those
   who are simple in mind and virtuous, and how
       she feasteth on their innocence and con-
           verteth all she eateth into dung.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                The Harlot


IN that masterpiece "Tannhäuser," without any request whatsoever, and
without any idiotic introduction, the song of an unknown minstrel breaks
unheralded on the astonished ears of the Landgrave's Court:

             Tender the phrase, and faint the melody,
             When poets praise a maiden's purity;
             Platitude linked to imbecility.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 249.

Murmurs of surprise arise, but it is not till he sings,

      As `mongst spring's sprigs sprouts sunshine's constant face;
      Or as a mill grinds on, with steady pace;
      So sprouts, so grinds, the unblushing commonplace.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 249.

that the murmurs break into an indignant uproar. Insolent scoundrel, rude
upstart, abusing our ears with your insults! Crucify him! boycott him! cut
him!

The Landgrave's society was shocked by that rude minstrel, and our society
is no doubt shocked by the satire of Aleister Crowley. On our book-shelves
his works stand literary pickled birches, to administer to our mental
ultimatums a corrective dose. A good purgative is an excellent thing taken
now and again, it keeps both the bowels free and the mind clear, and Mrs.
Grundy is nothing if she be not constipated.

"Thou poisonous bitch," says Crowley, when be addresses a Spenserian
verse to Mrs. Sally G--d, "The gawk and dowdy with the long grey teeth,"
who jumps to conclusion, instant, out of hand, that: "There is some nasty
secret underneath."*1. If Mrs. G--d, or Mrs. Grundy, should happen to
peruse this verse in "Why Jesus Wept," she might not be overpleased. If she
perused it at all, the violent Cascarian properties of this social drama would
_____________________________________________________________________________________
probably prove as efficacious as a No. 9 would to the hide-bound bowels of
Mr. Atkins. Due invitation is also made, and the following should even
entice her prudish cerebellum:

             But stow your prudery, wives and mothers,
             You know as much muck as ­ those others!
             Your modest homes are dull; you need me!
             Don't let your husbands know; but ­ read me!*2.

*1. Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 24.
*2. Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 22. Cf. Martial, Epigrams, XI. 16:

             Erubuit, posuitque meum Lucretia librum,
             Sed coram Bruto; Brute, recede, leget.

In this extraordinary volume, which seems to be the child of a promise made
to Mr. Chesterton in "The Sword of Song," we find a deeply cynical satire
castigating with no little severity the menial servility of modern society, as
scathing as a Beverland, as cynical as a Carlyle, and as satirical as a Butler.

Its great theme is the contest "of age and sense with flatulence and youth."
We have already shaken hands with Percy, Molly, and Lady Baird (Angela);
we have still to be introduced to Lord Glenstrae. The first two form the
flatulent element, the latter two the constipated substance of this drama.
Angela, the female quantity; Glenstrae the male: both are outwardly highly
moral; both are ready to lay their morality aside with skirt and shirt when
opportunity should offer.

When Percy fell in love with Molly, we saw how Lady Angela enticed him
from her by her maturer wisdom. Utterly false, the social hag of sixty totally
eclipses the girl of sixteen; she backs her knowledge against the latter's
innocence, and wins in a canter. So much for morality.

A woman is only as old as she feels; and grey hairs do not count so long as
they can be counted; such was the innocence of our early Victorian
grandmothers. Nowadays a woman is as young in manner as she is old in
years; and as for hair ask the coiffeurs. As cats grow cantankerous in old
age, so do women, and Angela is a good example of one of the many
vicious, crafty, and crabbed old vixens who monopolize society. When she
hears Percy murmur words of love to Molly, she hisses:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               Ah! if there were a devil to buy souls,
               Or if I had not sold mine! Quick bargain, God!
               Hell catch the jade! Blister her fat red cheeks!
               Rot her snub nose! Poison devour her guts!
               Wither her fresh clean face with old grey scabs,
               And venomous ulcers gnaw the baby breasts!*

Most charitable! But such is the Kingdom of Society.

"Angela" is a lovely name (so thinks inexperienced Percy), and
correspondingly the owner must have a lovely nature; and when he has
discovered what an abyss yawns between "girl" and "village girl" he throws
himself into the arms of the lovely Angela and listens to her murmuring
sighs as she stumbles:

               Ay, love, it is to feel your strength support me! [Aside.
               Will the doctors never catch up with the coiffeurs?*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 35.

Percy, the now distraught lover of Angela, turns to his first moony love, and
withdrawing his heart proffers her his purse:

                                     Buy yourself a pretty hat!
               Forget my pretty speeches!*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 38. ­ "My mind lay there as exhausted as my body! He
covered my blushes by the offer of a tiny remuneration." --Beverland, p. 405.

"If your heart were as big as your feet, you would have given me five francs instead of
five sous." --Frou-Frou.

The above needs no comment. Most men will understand it well enough; for
there are a hundred thousand women in London who need no editor's
appendix or translator's footnote.

Meeting Molly he asks her for a glass of milk, and comforts her on hearing
that she intends going into service, saying: "And so you shall, my dear, so
you shall. Come and live with my wife as her companion, and we will try
and find your lover for you. No doubt the arts of this ­ er ­ designing female
will soon lose their power ­ there, there, no thanks, I beg! I never could bear
to see a pretty wench cry ­ there, there!"* We have now thoroughly grasped
the quality of the male element, and the two together, the harlot and the
lecher, produce the social code and seven-eighths of the social woes.

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 39. Vide, The Martyrs of Hell's Highway.

"Must I, must I? Oh, sir, have pity!" sobs the poor disillusionized Molly, as
the male element who has enjoyed her, now shoves her aside "with the
dishes and the wine," a thousand a year, and a flat in Mayfair ­ quite a lucky
girl!

Two years later a woman shouts out, "Won't you come with me, ducky?"
This is Molly; a morphia-maniac also appears ­ this is Percy. Glenstrae is
now the President of the Children's Special Service Mission ­ suffer the
little children, etc. And Angela the head of a Zenana Mission. "Think of the
poor heathen kept in such terrible seclusion!" The end is as farcical as
Society herself. Angela is suffocated in sulphuric acid whilst washing off her
enamel, and Glenstrae sawn into thirty-eight pieces whilst playing with little
children, by stumbling against a circular saw.

"His Lordship was very fond of children, as you may know. It seems he was
pursuing ­ it is, I am told, an innocent child's game! ­ one of the factory
hands; and ­ he stumbled."*

Molly is pronounced virgo intacta by twenty-three eminent physicians,*1.
and marries Percy who is of course quite reformed.*2.

Aleister Crowley's estimate of society is certainly not a very high one, and
more especially so when he takes into consideration the pudibonderie of the
English. Society is but a gaping and toothed gin, as he well shows in "The
Honourable Adulterers" where women, the frailer sex, are the unfortunate
victims. Man made God, and God made woman out of one of man's
wretched little ribs. Regardless of manners, man sucks the wretched little
bone as he would the leg of a chicken, tears off the flesh and casts it into the
bin. The masses are but sheep, following the bell-wether convention; deprive
them of their initial, and they become neither lambs nor tigers but merely
asses. Ahinoam in "Jephthah" well described them when he addressed the
assembled multitude as:

      Ye are as children... I never hear your voice but know
      Some geese are gabbling.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 81.

Or again, in "The Nameless Quest,"

               God's heart! the antics, as they toil and shove!
               One grabs a coin, one life, another love.
               All shriek.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 189.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Cora Vavasour made a pretty just estimate of society when she called its
stulti "prurient licksores of society," for that is exactly what they are; when
poor, squalid; when rich, vulgar; the men fond of kitchen-maids, and the
women painted and cosmeticized, not only to hide the ravages of
debauchery, but to catch new lovers; the boys a breed of cads, and the girls a
breed of prudes.

The following is Crowley's estimate of the greatest nation on earth:

             O England! England, mighty England falls!
             .    .   .    .    .  . .   .   .   .   .   .   .
             Her days of wealth and majesty are done:
             Men trample her for mire!*

*Carmen Saeculare, vol. i, p. 215.

and for her eldest daughter, America, he also has but scant praise,

             Thou heart of coin beneath a brazen breast!
             Rotten republic, prostitute of gain!*

*Carmen Saeculare, vol. i, p. 217.

Wealth and luxury are her curse, as they are everywhere else:

                    The politician and the millionaire
                    Regain maternal dung.*

*Carmen Saeculare, vol. i, p. 217.

Nevertheless in a patriotic poem entitled "An Appeal to the American
Republic," he strongly urges union between Great Britain and the United
States.

             That friendship and dominion shall be wrought
                    Out of the womb of thought,
             And all the bygone days be held as things of nought.*1.
                    .     .    .  . .   .   .   .   .   .   . .    .
             Are we not weary of the fangéd pen?
                    Are we not friends, and men?
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                 Let us look frankly face to face ­ and quarrel then!*2.

*1. An Appeal to the American Republic, vol. i, p. 137.
*2. Ibid, vol. i, p. 139.

Strongly advocating fraternity between the two great nations, he vehemently
deprecates "The hireling quillmen and the jingo crowd."

In a poem called "A Valentine" in "Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic" ­
though a footnote winks, "nothing more; be it well remembered!" ­ we find
embedded in a slight verse of four lines the nucleus of all true patriotism,
greater than power, wealth, or dominion, and that is motherhood:

                 Fiercer desires may cast away
                         All things most good;
                 A people may forget to-day
                         Their motherhood.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 121.

This is the condition of the England of to-day: "O England! England, mighty
England falls!" because she no longer knows how to bear Englishmen.
Wealth cries for luxury, and luxury sniffs at the hem of lust, and lust rises
o'er us a vampire kite to drink dry the blood of our veins.

The two great ideals of our country, as Geoffrey Mortimer rightly says, are
the commercial, and the voluptuous.* Every man striving against his brother,
struggling and elbowing his way through the seething crowds of human life
to satisfy his own personal lusts.

*Blight of Respectability, p. 110.

Gentility has become the lowest plane of mental degradation, and so as the
monde sinks in this social earthquake does the demi-monde rise. Phryne
trips lightly to-day down Piccadilly, bringing with her no little of the
beauties of Praxiteles, and the craft of Apelles. We see her no longer the
draggle-tailed prostitute of the more eminently Christian centuries, but as a
Venus Anadyomene rising from the sea of human corruption. It was Phryne
who uttered those memorable words over the ruins of Thebes: "Alexander
diruit, sed meretrix Phryne refecit"; and it is now Alice and Rosie, who are
_____________________________________________________________________________________
uttering them over the ruins of the temple of Vesta. Thais cajoled Alexander
into burning the royal palace of Persepolis, and after his death married
Ptolemy, King of Egypt; and was it not at the feet of Lais that such men as
Demosthenes and Diogenes were to be found? Was it not also Catullus who
sang to the fickle Lesbia:

             Give me kisses thousand fold,
                    Add to them a hundred more;
             Other thousands still be told,
                    Other hundreds o'er and o'er.

And Propertius to the wayward Cynthia:

       Cynthia's unsnaring eyes my bondage tied:
             Ah wretch! no loves, till then, had touched my breast,
       Love bent to earth these looks of steadfast pride,
             And on my neck his foot triumphant press'd.

So it is to-day. Conventionalism is passing along its way chaotic and
disordered. Mutinus is worshipped at every street corner, and the goat of
Mendes slavers over the revellers as they wend their way home with their
Gitons and Messalinas.

"The decay of a people, as well as a family, begins with the preponderance
of selfishness,"*1. so says Max Nordau; and similarly Paul Carus writes,
"We know of no decline of any nation on earth, unless it was preceded by an
intellectual and moral rottenness, which took the shape of some negative
creed or scepticism, teaching the maxim that man lives for the pleasure of
living, and that the purpose of our life is merely to enjoy ourselves."*2.
Even as early as the middle of the seventeenth century, Adrian Beverland in
his Justinianoei de stolatae Virginitatis [sic] noticed this social collapse:
"dum puellas nostrates adeo verecundiam suam perfricta fronte excutiant, ut
a lupis, tremula clune extentoque collo saltantibus, vix discerni possint."*3.
When the rich approach the poor, "altera manu fert panem, penem ostentat
altera." Such is another Pantagruelism of Beverland, crude yet to the point.
"The girl who of her own accord presents herself to student, soldier or artist,
is considered, by Jove! to give a headlong consent to debauchery."*4. So we
see that whilst the upper classes are prostituting themselves for social
position, rank, and riches, the lower are doing so for a few wretched coins;
and the difference? One eats bread, and the other bread and butter. The
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"unco gude" thrive and heap execrations on the "unco bad." In "Oracles,"
Crowley states this with the straightforwardness of a Burns:

              What fierce temptations might not lovers bring
                         In London's wicked city?
              Perhaps you might yourself have one wee fling,
                         If you were pretty.

              What might not hard starvation drive you to,
                         With Death so near and sure?
              Perhaps it might drive even virtuous you,
                         If you were poor.*5.

*2. Fundamental Problems, p. vii.

And in "Orpheus" he well describes the social trinity:

              Nay! virtue is the devil's name for vice,
              And all your righteousness is filthy rags
              Wherein ye strut, and hide the one base thought.
              To mask the truth, to worship, to forget;
              These three are one.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, p. 208.

The moral character of a nation is its true capital, and the two great laws of
existence are ­ "The struggle for Life," and "The struggle for the Ideal," if
then the ideal is low, the capital is also wanting, and moral bankruptcy is at
hand.

It has been said,

                         Donna ociosa non può esser virtuossa.
                         (A woman of leisure cannot be virtuous.)

Which is very true, and neither can a nation. The present ages are peopled
with fiends and fools, living outwardly in precadian innocence, but inwardly
_____________________________________________________________________________________
in all the knowledge of the cities of the plains. The fiend crawls in the slimy
dark, and the fool pulls the white sheets of credulity over his head, and like
the gaby ostrich chuckles: "I can't see them, they can't see me" ­ he forgets
his odour. Crowley has torn the veil of mock-modesty from off the face of
Pseudo-morality, leaving her as bare and hideous to the gaze as the face of
the prophet of Khorassan. He has seized the social harlot and hurled her
from her throne; has forced open her jaws, and administered a sharp emetic,
a mental purgative, a rouser! Let us hope it will clean her out, and do her
good.

                       IV

             The Chapter known as

               The Mother

In which chapter it is related how Our Lady was
brought to bed of a rose; and how she planted it
in the garden of her heart, and how it grew and
 flourished in divers fashions. And how some-
    times it appears as white, and at others
       as red, and yet still at others both
        red and white together, so that
            the most wise were sore
            perplexed to tell which
                 was the colour
                  proper to it.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                The Mother


OUT of the countless thousands who tread the slippery and perilous paths of
the lower self Tannhäuser was one of the very few who emerged from its
clammy darkness purified and sanctified, to soar resplendent into the sunny
realms of the higher self; nor did he rest, but entranced in the immensity of
hope, rushing on, whirling through the abyss of time and space, he
ultimately lost self in the rapture of Nirvana. Again, in others so subtle is the
psychology of sense that this hysterical clinging to the Chaste often reacts,
hurling its unfortunate aspirant into the arms of Lubentina. The lust after
God and the lust after man are near akin. A woman crossed in love and
debarred from enjoying the sweet embraces of her lover, will embrace in his
stead the sour feet of her God. Similarly, Magdalene, having passionately
sought love, and having lost the skein of her desires in the labyrinthine
byways of lust, threw her weeping form at the feet of Him in whom she
found the ideal of her affection, washing those dusty feet with her tears, and
drying them with the long tresses of her hair, still perfumed with the kisses
of a thousand lovers. Jesus Christ and John Smith are very nearly related,
and a woman who is capable of loving one is also capable of loving the
other. Flaubert finely pictures this when he represents Madame Bovary,
kneeling at her prie-dieu and addressing to her Lord the same sweet words
she had formerly murmured to her lover in the effusions of adultery. So it
often happens that the most spiritual are at heart the most passionate. Passion
and Religion are the divine Dioscuri, children of Nemesis.

Man, when God became too intangible, too magnificent to approach,
conceived a mediator. Jahveh, surrounded by howling beasts and moulting
angels, fenced in by thunder and lightning, was quite cut off from the simple
minds of the Suburra, so Christ in those purlieus was manufactured; but He
in His turn grew exaltedly dim, magnified as the mist of ages crept around
Him, and when romantic love was born, man being no longer able to
worship man, enthroned the spotless Virgin in his stead; for in his heart still
lingered the sea-born form of Aphrodite, and on his lips the warm kisses of
the Cytheræn goddess, Philommedis, Basilea, Isis, or Astarte, call her what
you will, of passionate Love. So Christ was enthroned amongst the gods, and
His tender mother, the ever chaste Virgin, set on the humbler throne over the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
destiny of men's hearts; yet awake, the actual man loses the ideals of his
dreaming hours, straining to his heart the form of her whom he loves best on
earth, deserting his heavenly bride for his earthly spouse. Such is the duality
of love ­ the mundane and the celestial.

Which nations now are the most passionate, the man-worshippers or the
woman-worshippers? the latter, and it is for this reason that I included
Tannhäuser in the first part of this essay, rather than in the second, dealing
with the philosophy of Aleister Crowley. It is this spiritual exaltation,
curious as it may seem, which so often links the pure true love to the foul
false love. Love of man and woman is normal, love of man and woman for
God is abnormal, and the abnormal in its turn breeds the lustful, whether the
abnormality lies in the twists of the mind or the aberrations of the soul.
Amnon lusted after Tamar, he was a mental monster; Ezekiel devoured
dung, he was a spiritual abortion.

That a passionate nature is necessarily a lustful one, is often no more the
case than that a lustful one need necessarily be passionate; that lust as well
as passion often inhabit the same mind is true enough, and that its forms are
monstrous must be apparent to all students of sexual psychology; as the
cold-blooded lust of the lecher, who can only find stimulation for his gross
lecheries in the horrors of a de Sade, devouring in security and ease maidens
and youths, as the minotaur did of old ­ "semibovemque virum,
semivirumque bovem." This is the lust which is the most horrid, and the
most damnable; it takes much to produce a passionate man, but little to
engender a lustful one. The present generation possesses a minimum of
passion and a maximum of lust. There is no lust of Rome, of Greece, or
Arabia, no vice of Sodom, of Paphos, or Lampsacus, that is not practised to-
day in any of our larger modern towns. Lust of wealth, lust of ease, lust or
renown, lie as cankering worms in our hearts; and the cold bought lust of our
marriage-beds and our streets fill our days with woe. Chivalry is dead, and
the gilded Ass reigns in the place of the champing Stallion, and brays its
goatish desires over the naked form of the sterile Mule.

No longer in this ice-bound age of frozen phalli do we hear sung:

             For, swooning at the fervid lips
                    Of Artemis, the maiden kisses
             Sob, and the languid body slips
                    Down to enamelled wildernesses.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                     Fallen and loose the shaken tresses;
              Fallen the sandal and girdling gold,
              Fallen the music manifold
                     Of moving limbs and strange caresses,
                     And deadly passion that possesses
              The magic ecstasy of these
              Mad maidens, tender as blue seas.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i. p. 170.

For this is passion, if not quite so pure as some we have already seen, yet
still passion of an unlustful nature.

In "The Flight" we find in the following lines a still deeper glow:

                     The snow-bright weather
              Calls us beyond the grassy downs, to be
                     Beside the sea,
              The slowly breathing Ocean of the south.
                     Oh, make thy mouth
              A rosy flame like the most perfect star
                     Whose kisses are
              So red and ripe! Oh, let thy limbs entwine
                     Like love with mine!*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 91.

In the third act of "The Argonauts," we find the love of Medea is no longer
passion, but fiery entrancing lust:

                                                 At the midmost hour
              His mind given up to sleepless muttering
              Of charms not mine ­ decries Olympian ­
              All on a sudden he felt fervid arms
              Flung round him, and a sweet hot body's rush
              Lithe to embrace him, and a cataract
              Of amber-scented hair hissing about
              His head, and in the darkness two great eyes
              Flaming above him, and the whole face filled
              With fire and shapen as kisses. And those arms
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              And kisses and mad movements of quick love
              Burnt up his being, and his life was lost
              In woman's love at last!*

*The Argonauts, vol. ii, p. 100.

This was the love, or rather lust, of "that filthy sorceress."

We are now rapidly approaching the realms of the abnormal; for good and
evil are the toys of love as well as those of fate.

              The nymph and the satyr, the fair and the faulty alike are
       the guests of these amorous shades.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 90.

The virility of lust is vividly illustrated in "The Blood-Lotus":

       Foam whips their reeking lips, and still the flower-witch nestles
              to my lips,
       Twines her swart lissome legs and hips, half serpent and half
              devil, till

       My whole self seems to lie in her; her kisses draw my breath;
              my face
       Loses its lustre in the grace of her quick bosom; sinister

       The raving spectres reel; I see beyond my Circe's eyes no
              shape
       Save vague cloud-measures that escape the dance's whirling
              witchery.
              .   .    .    .   .  .     .    . . .   .  .   .
       Clothed with my flower-bride I sit, a harlot in a harlot's dress,
       And laugh with careless wickedness.
              .   .    .    .   .  .     .    . . .   .  .   .
       And with our laughter's nails refix his torn flesh faster to the
              wood,
       And with more cruel zest make good the shackles of the
              Crucifix.*

The nymphomaniac, the Lesbian, the man afflicted with pathic neurosis,

half-closed fingers of her hand, but we refuse to see why this pudibonderie
of the old "Unco gude" should make the discussion of "nymphomaniacs" a
tabooed subject, whilst she trumpets from the top of her holy bordel (St.
Paul's) deafening blasts of chaste(!) "bibliomania." Often these unfortunates
are of noble and generous character; who, striving against their fearful
adversity, have not the strength of will to cast off and slay the dragon of
their despair. The horror of this mental struggle is well depicted in
"Jephthah" when Jared says:

               Those eyes upon me, torturing my soul
               And threatening revenge? Those fingers gross,
               Purple, and horrible, to blister me
               With infamous tearing at my throat. O Hell!
               Vomit thy monsters forth in myriads
               To putrefy this fair green earth with blood,
               But make not me the devilish minister
               Of such a deed as this!*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 84.

Such was the almost frenzied exclamation of Jared, when he tried to shake
off the awful power that was urging him to become participator in the
murder of an innocent girl; and such is also often the terrible struggle that is
waged in the mind of the sexual invert. Impelled by energies sometimes in-
bred, sometimes self-made, and sometimes but mere matters of locality and
education, how often does he struggle ­ and in vain!

This terrible form of vice, chameleon-like, assumes many colours, one of the
principal being that of pleasure under the guise of pain. In such cases utter
satiety of the ordinary forms of pleasure gives birth to the desire for the pain
which was once dreaded, and the pleasure that the individual once
experienced in himself, and also the pleasure he felt was being experienced
by the participator of his actions, changes, growing little by little from a
spark into a flaming volcano of scorching pain, which he alone seeks,
finding new pleasures in the pain he himself endures, and fresh pleasures in
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the pain he himself inflicts. This is Lust. Peopled with all the horrors of
inversion, we pass from the simple realms of prostitution, to the dismal
Kingdoms of Sodom and Lesbos. Paederasts and Tribades flock round us,
yet we break away from them only to enter the foul jaws of the sexual hell of
shrieking flagellants, who rush upon us, as obscene Masochists grovel at our
feet; far into its depths we sink, and there at the altar of Phallommeda sits a
foul vulture gloating over a corpse; and its name is Necrophilia.

Into the realms of sexual-neurasthenia Aleister Crowley takes us, and it is
necessary that he should. His religion, his philosophy, and his psychology,
all point to an ultimate blending of our extreme perfections and
imperfections ­ vice and virtue ­ in one great monistic unity. He that would
be wise must know all things, all things that his transient life can enable him
to grasp. In the age which produced Rabelais and Boccaccio, vice was
flagrantly open, and the lust which the early Christians had first opposed and
secondly absorbed, slowly burnt within the society of their days, till it burst
out in the lecherous flames of a libidinous papacy. Many witty and
lascivious books, which in those times were openly enjoyed, have been
handed down to us. In the north the puritanic upheaval, still so felt, set in;
and in its first stages it probably was strictly anti-vicious, but in its second
merely a screen to hide vice from the public gaze. This, in its turn, led to the
good feeling a disgust for the bad, which in our age has developed into an
inborn shame which condemns open vice, but tolerates, even endows it,
when hidden. Open vice, unscreened and esotericised by religion, would
have in the sequence of events led to an open feeling of disgust, for Nature
never permits man to borrow without paying back, the general settlement
day will always sooner or later arrive, and then a new epoch of time will be
heralded in. Secret vice is the very worst form of vice; like a hidden gin we
fall betwixt its jaws unawares. The crass and studied silence that mothers
and fathers maintain over their children as regards all subjects of sex is
probably responsible for fifty percent: and more of all the sexual crimes and
sexual ills of the present day. When mankind has grasped the fact that its
organs of reproduction are no more disgusting than its organs of respiration,
it will then have grasped a greater truth than all philosophies have ever
promulgated, than all religions have ever revealed. "And they were both
naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed": THIS IS VIRTUE.
"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked": THIS IS VICE.

Know Thyself, Be Thyself, Honour Thyself, are the three greatest
commandments we can follow. This truth, universal and in its totality,
Crowley thunders forth midst sunshine and lightning. If, it is good to kiss,
then is it also good to know where kisses may lead to. We have already seen
them rising upward from youth through the passion of maturity, concrete
and abstract, earthly and spiritual; now let us turn about and descend the
slippery road of lust, so essential to the basic knowledge of the good.

Among the extraordinary antipathies and sympathies of the human mind,
few are so startling as the frequent attraction of contraries. Good attracts
bad, and bad good, in the love-history of life over and over again shall we
find this:

                                             Have they divined
              This simplest spirit-bond,
              The joy of some bad woman's deadly kiss;*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 104.

In the "Lesbian Hell" we see those white unsated women, and in "The Fatal
Force" one so flushed with lust, that she has become blind to reality:

              Then said the goddess: "I indeed am pure
              In my impurity; immaculate
              In misconception; maiden in my whoredom;
              Chaste in my incest, being made a god
              Through my own strength.*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 143.

Thus she spoke to the assembled princes and peoples of Egypt, when sixteen
seasons past she sat crowned, naked, exultant, pregnant with the child of her
own son's begetting. Awed by the enormity of her lust, the multitudes
worship their Phædrian queen:

                                   But the mood passed, and we see
              A lecherous woman whose magician power
              Is broken, and the balance of her mind
              Made one with the fool's bauble, and her wand
              That was of steel and fire, like a reed, snapped!*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 143.

Once again we see her, Ratoum, Queen of Egypt, before the coffin which is
supposed to contain the child of her incest, but which holds in reality her
leprous and long-forgotten husband. She is maddened with lust and religious
frenzy, and stands entranced till the leper rises as from the dead, and S'afi,
the child of her whoredom, tears off his mask and shrieks:

               I am the hideous poison of thy veins
               And foulest fruit of thy incestuous womb.*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 150.

"I am thy mother," is her answer; so, even in her frenzied madness, the
greatest force in nature asserts itself. He stabs her, and stabs himself! such
also is filial love.*

*Compare story of Semiramis and Ninyas.

In "The Mother's Tragedy" the characters are practically reversed. Ulric,
who ravishes Cora, his mother, even sinks deeper in the mire of lust than
Ratoum. It is a curious case of love baulked turning to the foulest lust. He is
passionately in love with her, lustfully in love; all the exuberance of his
youth runs fire in his veins; he sees in the object of his adoration ­ as Percy
saw in Angela ­ the only waters that would quench his flaming desire. He
knows not Cora to be his mother; Cora Vavasour of the halls, and himself
her bastard son.

               My wife! O Cora, I have loved you so!
               My heart is like a fountain of the sea.
               I burn, I tremble; in my veins there swims
               A torrid ecstasy of madness. Ah!
               Ah, God! I kiss you, kiss you! O you faint!
               Sweetheart, my passion overwhelms your soul!
               Your virginal sweet spirit cannot reach
               My fury...*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 159.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thus in the intoxication of his desire he raves, in her silence he sees her
affection, and in the terror of her eyes her love.

Cora is horror-stricken: "you beast!" "you fool!" "I am defiled." He stands
dazed and wondering. Then in the following pages she tells him: "I am the
mother of thy bastard birth"; he prays, he threatens, and shrieking hurls
insult on insult at her:

             Me, the sole pledge of your debaucheries,
             You keep ­ your love, the mere maternity
             You share with swine and cattle!...
             .    .   .   .    .    . .  .   .   .   .   . .
                                         I love you still
             With carnal love and spiritual love!
             And I will have you, by the living God,
             To be my mistress. If I fail in this,
             Or falter in this counsel of despair,
             May God's own curses dog me into hell,
             And mine own life perpetuate itself
             Through all the ages of eternity.
             Amen! Amen! Come. Cora, to my heart!*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 163.

Madeline, whom Cora had hoped to have made Ulric's bride, appears, and
for a moment his mad fury slackens only to burst out again, as he drags Cora
from the room. When she re-enters her voice is hoarse and horrible:

             O Phædra! lend me of thy wickedness,
             Lest I go mad to contemplate myself!*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 164.

Then turning to Madeline ­ young, pretty, and foolish ­ who bids her seek
help from the Mother of God, "Our Lady of the seven stars" says:

             Can you not see? I am cut off from God!
             Loathsome bull-men in their corruption linked
             Whisper lewd fancies in my ear. Great fish,
             Monstrous and flat, with vile malignant eyes,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             And crawling beetles of gigantic strength,
             Crushed, mangled, moving, are about me. Go!
             Go! do not touch the carcass of myself
             That is abased, defiled, abominable.*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 65.

Then Ulric enters, evidently now totally mad; the fearful power of his
Neronic lust has reft asunder the last thread of his sanity; in his hand he
carries a razor, first he slays Madeline, and then, at his mother's bidding,
himself:

             A blood-grey vapour and a scorpion steam
             To poison the unrighteous life of God!*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, p. 65.

Thus does this fearful tragedy end. Gruesome with lust and cruelty, Ulric, a
horrible perversion, overcome by the violence of his desires, a second
Amnon, a second de Sade. His ideal once at least partially pure, broke, as the
truth burst on his ear, into a wild and fearful nightmare; and in his brutal
fury we find that perhaps the Sadism of to-day is but an Avatar of those past
days, when our progenitors, like some still existing savages, carried on their
courtship with club and spear, and solemnized their marriage with rape and
ravishment.

Still one more phase of perverse love remains for us to study; the curious
lust of man for woman as depicted in "Jezebel," a curious manifestation of
what is known as Masochism, which after the death of the object of its
fascination, grows almost into the vampire desire of necrophilia. In "A
Saint's Damnation," which is included under the same cover, we see the
power of love caught in the arms of restraint slowly smoulder into a burning
desire:

             Passion to feed upon your shoulders bare,
                    And pass the dewy twilight of our sin
             In the intolerable flames of hair.
             .   .   .   .     .    . . .  .   .  .   .  .
             Give thee my body as a fire to hold--
                    O love, no words, no songs ­ your breast my
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                             bower!*

*Jezebel: and other Tragic Poems, vol. i, p. 133.

In "Jezebel" we find the same desire, but unfanned by restraint, in whose
place stands a woman's disdain. He, the prophet, goes to curse her ­ but
loves her instead:

              For lo! she saw me, and beheld
                      My trembling lips curled back to curse,
              Laughed with strong scorn, whose music knelled
                      The empire of God's universe.
              And on my haggard face upturned
              She spat! Ah God! how my cheek burned!

              Then as a man betrayed, and doomed
                      Already, I arose and went,
              And wrestled with myself, consumed
                      With passion for that sacrament
              Of shame. From that day unto this
              My cheek desires that hideous kiss.

              Her hate, her scorn, her cruel blows,
                      Fill my whole life, consume my breath;
              Her red-fanged hatred in me glows,
                      I lust for her, and hell, and death.
              I see that ghastly look, and yearn
              Toward the brands of her that burn.*

*Jezebel: and other Tragic Poems, vol. i, pp. 130-131.

Sleep shuns him, and his parched throat thirsts for the blood of her veins,
"Aching with all the pangs of night"; his vision grows more monstrous, a
horrible psychopathic mist dims his mind, and all the love he lavished on the
body of the living woman turns to a lust for her cadaver:

              The spirit filled me. And behold!
                      I saw her dead stare to the skies.
              I came to her; she was not cold,
                      But burning with old infamies.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               On her incestuous mouth I fell,
               And lost my soul for Jezebel.
               .    .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
               They cast her forth on Naboth's field
                       Still living, in her harlot's dress;
               Her belly stript, her thighs concealed,
                       For shame's sake and for love's no less.
               Night falls; the gaping crowds abide
               No longer by her stiffening side.
               .    .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
               "Ah! prophet, come to mock at me
                       And gloat on mine exceeding pain?"
               "Nay but to give my soul to thee,
                       And have thee spit at me again!"
               She smiled ­ I know she smiled ­ she sighed,
               Bit my lips through, and drank, and died!
               .    .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
               My veins poured out her marriage cup,
                       For holy water her cruel tongue;
               For blessing of white hands raised up,
                       These perfumed infamies unsung;
               For God's breath, her sharp tainted breath;
               For marriage-bed, the bed of death.
               .    .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
               The host is lifted up. Behold
                       The vintage spilt, the broken bread!
               I feast upon the cruel cold
                       Pale body that was ripe and red.
               Only, her head, her palms, her feet,
               I kissed all night, and did not eat.*

*Jezebel, vol. i, pp. 131-132.

We have passed through many fields, many groves, many wildernesses; we
have crossed the pure snowy mountains of Chastity, and the boiling seas of
Passion, losing ourselves in not a few of those intricate and unknown by-
paths which lead to trackless wastes and gloomy abysms. Aleister Crowley
has pointed us the way, twined round the Tree of Knowledge he has offered
us fruit, and we have eaten of it with face smiling or awry; we have become
as gods knowing good and evil, and having become gods with much striving
_____________________________________________________________________________________
against adversity, may some day become men; for to become a god is but to
become as the image created in the brain of man, but to become a man is to
become a progenitor of gods; and then perchance we may realize the
sublimity of the Great Motherhood, whose children are as one, a flaming
crown of glory twined and interwoven with roses both white and red.

This mingling of the passionate and the chaste we find is the new ideal that
Crowley flashes before our dazzled sight. Away with Mary, immaculate
Mother of Christ: away with Messalina, incestuous prophetess of Lust.
Away! Away! To the West, to the East, till they meet in some flaming
region of equatorial fury, and flashing interfuse and interblend.

Once again must a prophet of the Lord arise and wed a wife of whoredoms,
who hath committed great whoredom, departing from the Lord. Once again
must Hosea expire on the crimson lips of Gomer, and from the womb of a
harlot must the Christ be reborn a woman, wise, beautiful, and young; who
is both Circe and Diana, Isis and Aphrodite, in whose veins course all the
fury of Medea, all the abominations of Canidia, who revels in the infernal
rites of Sagana and Locusta, and yet is vestal and virgin; white as the driven
snow, pure as a mountain rill. One with the pale Mother of Bethlehem and
the scarlet harlot of the City of Abominations. Then will the storm-clouds
part, and the smoke and steam of the earth vanish, and the social harlot,
whose painted buttocks have heaved and hog-wallowed through the
centuries, shall be seized and hurled from the rock of Tarpeia, and
smothered with the goatish kisses of her lechery midst the charnel glitter of
her gold. And the Vestal-courtezan will rise before us, purple and white,
clothed in the sun, and set between the moon and the twelve stars of heaven.
So another league will be accomplished toward that city which is God.

We have already seen in "The Mother's Tragedy" and "The Fatal Force,"
that the love of the mother, though it could not cause the shadow to travel
backwards one degree on the face of the dial, it at least clothed in a white
garment of chastity, not only the amorous music-hall artiste, but even the
incestuous queen of Egypt. And though "Jezebel" did not love as they loved,
her power of loving many exonerated her want of love for one or a few. She
like the Circe of old who turned the followers of Ulysses into swine, herself
fell a victim entangled in those same meshes she had spun wherein to entrap
her unwary fellows. "A woman who is without love," writes Lévi, "absorbs
and degrades all who come near her; she who loves, on the other hand,
diffuses enthusiasm, nobility, and life."*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*The Doctrine of Transcendent Magic, p. 125.

In her we see a contorted symbol of wifehood, whilst in the latter cases, and
especially in "The Fatal Force," we find that of Motherhood. The true wife
must sacrifice her children before the shrine of her lover, and the true mother
must sacrifice her lover on the altar of her children. This is no paradox, no
riddle, no twisting of words; for Crowley offers us in the glittering chalice of
Eternity the sacred blood of the Bull, the Second Christ; and as the first, the
Lamb of God, sprang from the immaculate womb of the Virgin-Mother, so
shall this second incarnation spring blood-red from the snowy lips of the
great Supernal Mother, androgynous, the Circe-Isis of the ages.

In "Alice, an Adultery," we see a woman passionate in her love, strenuous in
her affection, yet in the end failing by abandoning her lover for her children.
Not so, however, in "Rosa Inferni," wherein we feel, as we read, a ferocity
of passion which burns into us like a hail of molten glass;

                                   Aha! the veil is riven!
               Beneath the smiling mask of a young bride
               Languorous, luscious, melancholy-eyed;
               Beneath the gentle raptures, hints celestial
               Of holy secrets, kisses like soft dew,
               Beneath the amorous mystery, I view
               The surer shape, a visage grim and bestial,
               A purpose sly and deadly, a black shape,
               A tiger snarling, or a grinning ape
               Resolved by every devilish device
               Upon my murder.*

*Rosa Inferni, vol. iii, p. 91.

A vampire she rises over her lover:

               I see below the beautiful low brow
               (Low too for cunning, like enough!) your lips,
               A scarlet splash of murder. From them drips
               This heart's blood; you have fed your fill on me.*

*Rosa Inferni, vol. iii, p. 92.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Further on in this same series of poems we come across an almost more lurid
description of this Messaline in "The Jilt," in which her new-found lover
feasts off the agony of her last victim, which still moistens her blood-red
lips:

                His death lends savour to our passionate life;
                         His is the heart I taste upon your tongue;
                His death-spasms our love-spasms, my wife;
                         His death-songs are the love-songs that you sung!
                         .    .  .   .   .    .   .  .   .    .  . .  .
                Ah! Sweet, each kiss I drink from you is warm
                         With the dear life-blood of a man ­ a man!
                The scent of murder lures me, like a charm
                         Tied by some subtlety Canidian.

                Ay! as you suck my life out into bliss,
                         Its holier joy is in the deadlier thirst
                That drank his life out into the abyss
                         Of torture endless, endless and accurst.

                I know him little; liking what I know.
                         But you ­ you offer me his flesh and blood.
                I taste it ­ never another vintage owe,
                         Nor bid me sup upon another food!

                This is our marriage; firmer than the root
                         Of love or lust could plant our joy, my wife,
                We stand in this, the purple-seeded fruit
                         Of yon youth's fair and pitiable life.*

*The Jilt, vol. iii, pp. 99, 100.

So we see before us a curious form, at times cold as the marble statue of
Pygmalion, and then, when the kiss of Venus had incarnadined those chill
lips, all life and passion, transforming those ivory breasts into sharp points
of liquid fire, and those still thighs into all the subtlety of twin snakes. Yet
that mouth, breathing the purple fire of love, or cold as the dusty lips of the
age-worn Sphinx, is one ­ Rosa Inferni, Rosa Coeli, for that which is below
is as that which is above. The latter has still to be published, but the petals of
_____________________________________________________________________________________
its bursting bud have already in many a fair verse made bright the pages of
this essay. `Twixt these twain we find Rosa Mundi, "the keystone of the
Royal Arch of Sex":*1

                      Single in love and aim,
                      Double in form and name,*2

*1. Rosa Mundi, vol. iii, p. 52.
*2. Rosa Mundi, vol. iii, p. 54.

that arch which rests on the two great pillars of Solomon's temple, black and
white, and contrary, yet their power is one, for they are the limbs of God.

"Rosa Mundi" stands before us crowned, naked, and wonderful. Neither
Alice nor Archais, neither Ratoum nor Cora, neither Venus nor Isis, yet the
woven filament of all these glowing petals into one flaming Rose of glory; in
whose sceptred-heart burns the white phallus of God, and whose jewelled
crown is crimson with the lips of the passionate daughters of Men.

             Rose of the World!
             Red glory of the secret heart of Love!
             Red flame, rose-red, most subtly curled
             Into its own infinite flower, all flowers above!
             Its flower in its own perfumed passion,
             Its faint sweet passion, folded and furled
             In flower fashion;
             .   .     .     .  . .   .  .   .   .  .   .   .
             The Rose of Dew, the Rose of Love and Night,
             The Rose of Silence, covering as with a vesture
             The solemn unity of things
             Beheld in the mirror of truth,
             The Rose indifferent to God's gesture,
             The Rose on moonlight wings
             That flies to the House of Fire,
             The Rose of Honey-in-Youth!
             Ah! No dim mystery of desire
             Fathoms this gulf! No light invades
             The mystical musical shades
             Of a faith in the future, a dream of the day,
             When athwart the dim glades
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Of the forest a ray
             Of sunlight shall flash and the dew die away!
             .    .     .   .   .  . .  .  .   .   .  .  .
             Rose of the World, Rose of the Uttermost
             Abode of Glory, Rose of the High Host
             Of Heaven, mystic, rapturous Rose!
             The extreme passion glows
             Deep in this breast; thou knowest (and love knows).*

* Rosa Mundi, vol. iii, pp. 51-55.

Thus we end our chapter which we have called "The Mother." And as Diana,
Luna, and Hecate are one, so Rosa Mundi, Rosa Coeli, Rosa Inferni, unite
Triformis in one great trinity in unity. And as the Moon kisses the Sea, so
does Diana embrace the wave-born Aphrodite, as she rises from the blue
foam, star of the Deep; she who pours back into the ocean of Eternity the
pure waters of inexhaustible chastity mingled with the never-dying flames of
inextinguishable love.

At last she has been disclosed to us, she concerning whom it was prophesied
in the beginning of Time; and as the hollow sobs of the dying years have
rolled back sonorous, rumbling and echoing, into the soundless depths of
æonial infinity, she who was promised has at length been revealed; she who
will crush the head of that old serpent, who has so long bruised the heel of
the children of men who were born in the knowledge of good and of evil.

                              The Old Bottle


WHAT is religion? In its primitive form, metatarsals; in its ultimate,
metaphysics. Our ancestors would walk through the lightning and thunder of
the uncivilized day, with a string of charmed knuckle-bones slung round
their throats; whilst we in our turn walk through the drizzle and fog of the
present decivilized night, with a rosary of ideals twined round our minds:
one worshipped a bogey, the other a bogus. O! sancta simplicitas: homo
indeed is sapiens! Have we progressed? Not one whit. Worship is at all
times and everywhere one and the same, an insult to the offerer and the
receiver alike; sacrifice, the egotism of usurers; prayer, the misdirected
energy of idiots; ceremony but an excuse for vice; and dogma but a
legitimized imposition. Such is religion!

Why, then, has man ever sought this Moloch of his nights, shedding o'er it
his own blood, and drenching it with that of others, if it prove but an incubus
of sorrow and despair? Firstly, because most men are fools; secondly,
because those who are not are knaves.

               I take no heed of trickery played
                       By cunning mad Elijah's skill,
               When the great test of strength was made
                       On Carmel's melancholy hill,
               And on the altar stone the liar
               Cried "Water," and poured forth Greek fire!*

*Ahab, vol. ii, p. 123.

If we could be optimistic enough to believe in a (semi-)omnipotent power
(pure omnipotency is anachronistic), we should believe this malady were
inflicted on man as are the measles, the croup, and the chicken-pox, so as to
stimulate romance, and retard that ultimate uninteresting state perfection.
This not being so, we can only suggest that being descended from the flat-
nosed simiæ, besides being generally flat all round, man must have lost his
wits with his tail, both being now exceedingly rudimentary. Having lost his
tail, he could no longer swing in the ethereal blue; and then, losing his wits,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
grew a mental tail, and swung in the deep inane, devising the ideal of
discomfort, wherein all pleasures should be considered as evil, and all pains
as exceedingly good; chewing aloes he swore they were as melligenous as
the sugar cane, called black white, white black, and this fair world the abode
of his satanic majesty; beat his wife, swore at the 'kids,' and kicked the cat
over the garden wall. Not being able to walk on his head, with his feet in the
air, he, however, did and continues to do his best to carry what remains of
his fungoid organ of thought as low as he possibly can, his desires in his
stomach, and his thoughts in the vicinity of his prostate gland.

There was a time when man did not know how to cook his dinner; we
sincerely hope there will be a time when he ceases to cook his thoughts, but
that time, in spite of science and art, is in the far here-after.

Some people labour under the idea that a generation or two hence the world
will be sprawling at the feet of Reason instead of those of God. Possibly, yet
God is still far from being a centenarian, and our heavenly Father bids well
to rival our earthly Parr; but as long as we sprawl, what matters it what we
sprawl before, if it be the shin-bone of an ass, or the pineal gland of our
wretched imagination? Whatever man has touched he has spoilt: one day he
was struck with the mystic poetry of the waves, and he promptly hocussed
slimy monsters from out the deep; gazing on his lithe and winsome daughter,
he held her head under the green flood to satiate the rapacity of the offspring
of his deluded imagination, who (he judged) appreciated his dinner, as well
as he did himself. Having devised religion, he by degrees fell into such
excesses of worship, that religion bid well to exterminate his whole
wretched race; thereupon he disclosed science, which, when it has destroyed
his former hobby, will in its turn run riot over all, till it also becomes such a
pest, that it too, will have to give way to something better. Never contented,
man ultimately finds that his double collection of manna rots. What the end
will be no one knows, and few care; that we shall ever reach a state verging
on perfection is most improbable; man could not stand it for long unless his
worldly span were one of unambitious affluence, and his heavenly one of
spasmodic sensuality and forgetfulness. To have plenty of money and no
ambitions, to eat like a hog, sleep like a hog, and to breed like a hog; to be in
a perpetual state of priapism, and to fall into slumbersome forgetfulness just
when the pleasant is beginning to pall, and then to wake again to all the fury
of desire. These two states, if we carefully dissect the corpse of religion, we
shall find to lie at its basic foundation.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
On turning now to the works before us, we find traced therein an elaborate
system rising from the fear of primitive man to the veneration of his present-
day offspring. Fear, the basal foundation of all gods, found a subtle soil in
Ignorance; Ignorance reacted on God, producing Superstition; Superstition,
Cruelty; Cruelty, all the tigerish longings of the day and the hoggish
gratifications of the night.

Pessimism is necessarily the foundation of all religion; for if man were
normally optimistic he would not have conceived such a hierarchy of tyrants
as that of his gods. The man who formerly cut himself with flints before a
lump of stone or clay, is in no way more foolish than he who prays to an
omnipotent conception; the former was jealous and exacting, and so is the
latter, the former a thing, the latter an idea, and both an ideal. This evolution
is very vividly de-scribed in the poem entitled "The Growth of God":

              Fear grows, and torment; and distracted pain
                    Must from sheer agony some respite find;
              When some half-maddened miserable brain
                    Projects a god in his detesting mind.
              A god who made him ­ to the core all evil,
                    In his own image ­ and a God of Terror;
              A vast foul nightmare, an impending devil;
                    Compact of darkness, infamy, and error.

              Some bestial woman, beaten by her mates,
                    In utter fear broke down the bar of reason;
              Shrieked, crawled to die; delirium abates
                    By some good chance her terror in its season,
              Her ravings picture the cessation of
                    Such life as she had known: her mind conceives
              A God of Mercy, Happiness and Love;
                    Reverses life and fact: and so believes.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 179.

This last line practically contains the fundamental basis of all religion. Man
finding that Nature was but a thousand-headed hydra, for ever battling with
him on the field of the world, fearing her awful powers and dim mysteries,
reversed facts which were so unpalatable to him, and drinking deep of the
cup of joy during those short moments when it was proffered to his lips,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
dimly or vividly saw through the intoxicating fumes cloudy realms of
perpetual libation, of hope, and of glorious expectations. Heaven and then
Hell. The former first, for man is essentially selfish; having found a fat billet
for himself, it was not long before he found a lean one for his neighbour:

                                     To divide my devotees
              From those who scorned me to the close:
              A worm, a fire, a thirst for these;
              A harp-resounding heaven for those!*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 43.

The primary object of existence is to keep alive, and all heavens, hells,
paradises, gehennas, valhallas, nirvanas, and other abodes of the dead, have
never for long exercised such a superabundance of power as to crush and
extinguish the flaming desire for existence. The fools having devised God
with jam for the good in heaven, were not long in devising Satan with a
pickled birch for the naughty in hell. Those who were not fools and who
found their bread unpalatably dry, found that butter could be supplied free of
cost by literally doing nothing. Anyone familiar with a native city in India is
aware of the vast hordes of indolent fakirs who practically do nothing except
stand still and gaze vacantly into the clouds uttering, "Rama," "Hanuman,"
and before they drop their eyes their bowls are full of atta and dhal. Hence
priests and kings, those truly greedy anthropophagi:

              The vale is black with priests. They fight,
                       Wild beasts, for food,
              The orphan's gold, the widow's right,
                       The virgin's snood,
              All in their maws are crammed within the night
                       That hides their chosen wood,
              Where through the blackness sounds the sickening noise
              Of cannibals that gloat on monstrous joys.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 126.

Feeding perhaps first on man's body, the priest soon found, after investing
his victim with an immortal soul, that the soul would form an excellent basis
for blackmail, enabling man to buy off the terrors of hell through the
medium of the priest who held the keys of heaven:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              ...still death reigns, and God and priests are fed,
              Man's blood for wine, man's flesh for meat and bread,*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 106.

And these priests are not dead yet.

As the human race throve so did their gods, the old savage of man's early
thoughts grew, and growing became more evil, as their gods so were men,
and as men so were their gods, the one continually acting and reacting on the
other:

              Of obscene deities and apish men,
              Rivalling their god in petty filthiness.*

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 19.

Gods sprang from gods:

              For the old gods indeed go down to death,
              But the new gods arise from rottenness.*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 143.

The first cause, a pervading terror, was grand in its wilfulness compared
with the degraded images which soon eclipsed man's reason, monopolizing
worship and exacting prayer:

                                             What folly can compare
                      With such stupidity, as prayer?*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 178.

Crowley very truly remarks in that battering-ram of religious destruction,
"Pentecost" ­ a witty note is appended, quoted from the "Sydney Bulletin,"
which suggested, that instead of perpetually worrying the Almighty for rain,
the people should pray once and for all for a high range of mountains in
Central Australia, which would of course supply rain automatically*1. ­ that
man cannot elude fate by such a paltry dodge; for even the god of our
_____________________________________________________________________________________
imaginings is not quite such an ass as all that. The messenger in "Jephthah"
most sensibly remarked, when he rushed with the news of the enemy's
approach into the assembly of Israel:

              My lords, take heed now, prayer is good to save
              While yet the foemen are far off; but now
              They howl and clamor at our very gates.*2.

*1. The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 109.
*2. Jephthah, vol. i, p. 69.

Which in other words simply means, as long as man does not see or
understand he will pray; when he does, he won't.

Another juggle to elude fate is sacrifice. Sacrifice and prayer have ever run
in harness together under the whistling of the priestly lash, "I will brain you
if you refuse to render tribute to me," said the primitive chief to his primitive
neighbour; "I will put you in jail if you won't pay me your taxes," says the
modern government to the modern citizen. And as religion could not
possibly restrain her octopus tentacles of cupidity from the game of grab, she
also hisses, "Pray to God and he will tie a knot in his bandana and perhaps
remember it some day; but above all, sacrifice to me, or by Jove! I will
sacrifice you:" and the fool, even in his folly, thought it were better to lose
his wits than his brains, and his turnips than his turnip; so he dug and he dug,
and he slew and he slew, religion growing fatter and fatter, spawning
churches and breeding sects, till unfortunate man found himself so hedged in
by the spiritual, that in order to maintain his life in this world he had to
acknowledge the Church's supreme authority, and grovel before her in the
dust of degradation. Crowley gives a curious example of this growth, and the
ultimate sameness of all religions in that gruesome and weird drama, "The
God-Eater."

Maurya the sister of Criosda says:

       Criosda, ever the same! The old world runs
       On wheels of laughter for us little ones;
       To you, whose shoulders strain, the chariot seems
       A poised fiend flogging you to hell.*

*The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 131.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Criosda, the self-intoxicated God-Eater, drunk on the name of blood, slays
his sister, and feasts in true religious frenzy off her corpse ­ a veritable black
mass:

              Criosda. With red lips reeking from the sweet foul feast,
       I sang in tuneless agony the spell;
       Rolled athwart space the black words: then some force
       Tore me: I heard the tears drop in my heart.
       I heard the laughter of some utmost god
       Hid in the middle of matter. That was I,
       The hideous laughter of the maniac laugh
       When loathing makes the bed to lust, and twine
       The limbs of agony about the trunk
       Of torture ­ rapture stabbing through ­ Maurya!
       Ay, that was I; and I the weeping wolf
       That howls about this hell that is my heart;
       And I the icy and intangible
       That beholds all, and is not.*

*The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 137.

Looking into the crystal globe he sees the future two thousand years after the
horrid murder. The deed has thriven into a religion, and the victim into a
god.

              As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be:
       world without end.*

*The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 139.

mutters Rupha the hag of eternity, as Criosda falls dead before the mummy
of the murdered girl, his sister Maurya:

                                          Murder a mode
              And love a mode of the unknown that is,
              That not thyself nor I can ever see.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*The God-Eater, vol. ii, p. 138. The gods of the ancients were all immolaters of men, and
loved blood. Moloch only differed from Jahveh by lack of orthodoxy, and the god of
Jephthah had similar mysteries to those of Belus.

A fitting cry indeed to herald us into the pustulous domains of Jahveh and
his murdered Son.

In dealing with the Christian faith, Aleister Crowley by no means goes
simply baldheaded for it like the unread secularist of the sixpenny platform;
for, we find a distinct growth from a reverential regard towards its founder,
to a satirical disregard for him, and his final dismissal in a jest. Such a
mental progression is only natural; from the sublime irrationality of a de
Kempis the student will almost inevitably, even unwittingly, pass through
the adulations of a Renan, before he assumes the biting satire of a Saladin, or
the poetic iconoclasm of a Swinburne.

Christ, firstly, as the Son of God, is divine, omnipotent, in fact he is God;
secondly, as the Son of Man, is noble, generous, lovable, in fact, man; but,
thirdly, as the offspring of the carnalities of a Byzantine mob, which is the
true Christ of history, he assumes a vampire form, a horror fed on the blood
of children, the virility of youths, the chastity of maidens. Hardly a single
evil of the present day, if traced back a few hundred years, and frequently
not half so long as that, but finds its birth in some corruption practised by the
Harlot of the seven hills, or the Monster of the six wives. It is only necessary
to study such works as those of Buckle or Draper, of White or Stewart Ross,
or better still, if time permits, those of ecclesiastical historians, written by
the pens of divines, to become aware of the appalling gloom that was cast
over the splendour that was Greece, and the grandeur that was Rome, in that
dismal night of a thousand years which lapped the Western world in a sea of
blood and tears. Ignorance crushed the mind of Europe, as a hammer of lead,
from the time that Constantine ­ tyrant, murderer, and debauchee ­ threw in
his lot with the yelping mob of Constantinople. On that fateful day a fiery
cross shone in the sky,*1. and to this day it has been our lot to carry its
cankerous form branded on our hearts and corroded in our minds. Not till
now are we waking from the turbid dreams, the feverish lust, and dismal
superstition, that sprang from the gaberlunzies of the Suburra:

                                   The Lord's Day.

       The foolish bells with their discordant clang
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               Summon the harlot-ridden Hell to pray:
               The vicar's snout is tuned; the curates bray
       Long gabbled lessons, and their noisy twang
       Fills the foul worshippers with hate; the fang
               Of boredom crushes out the holy day,
               Where whore and jobber sit and gloom, grown grey
       For hating of each other; the hours hang.*2.

*1. In hoc signo vinces.
*2. The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 202.

And the pen of Crowley like that of Saladin, Swinburne, and Shelley, is but
another douche of cold water to wake the frowsy sleepers of the night, and
wash from their gluey eyes the nightmare of Christian Supremacy.

In the earlier poems of Crowley, we find not only a reverential handling of
the Christ idea, but an almost orthodox adoration for the Christ Himself. In
the last two verses of "Aceldama" this is strongly brought out. "Thy love
will stand while ocean winds endure"; and again, "Here I abandon all myself
to thee."*1. In "Songs of the Spirit" we find this veneration acutely
portrayed, and the Christ as depicted in "The Goad" closely resembles the
one as described in "The Farewell of Paracelsus to Aprile." Here is a
passage from each:

                                             I contemplate the wound
                      Stabbed in the flanks of my dear silver Christ.
               He hangs in anguish there; the crown of thorns
                      Pierces that palest brow; the nails drip blood;
               There is the wound; no Mary by Him mourns,
                      There is no John beside the cruel wood;
               I am alone to kiss the silver lips;
                      I rend my clothing for the temple veil;
               My heart's black night must act the sun's eclipse;
                      My groans must play the earthquake...*2.

               Still as I journey through the waste, I see
                      A silver figure more divine arise;
               The Christ usurps the horizon for me,
                      And He requickens the forgotten skies;
                      His golden locks are burning on my eyes,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                 And he with rosy finger points the way,
                        The blood-wrought mystic path of Paradise,
                 That leads at last through yonder icy spray
                 Of Death to the blue vault of the undying day.*3.

*1. Aceldama, vol. i, p. 6.
*2. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 30.
*3. Ibid. vol. i, p. 40.

In the last verse of "A Spring Snow Storm in Wastdale,"*1. there grows a
wavering doubt, which leaps out furiously in the "Preliminary Invocation" in
"Jephthah," addressed to A.C.S., breaking the shackles of the "improving
idea" of Christ:

                 Let there be light! ­ the desecrated tomb
                 Gaped as thy fury smote the Galilean.*2.

*1. Song of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 43.
*2. Jephthah, vol. i, p. 64.

Almost a Shelleyan slur lies in the last of the above words. He is no more the
mystic Christ, or the gentle Jesus, but merely a Galilean, of a tribe crude and
despised. Very different do we find Crowley's opinions, in his later works,
regarding this unfortunate fakir. The glamour of enthusiastic and
unsuspecting youth soon disappears to be swallowed up in the reality of a
maturer understanding:

                 He took the universe on trust;
                 He reconciled the world below
                 With that above; rolled eloquence
                 Steel-tired o'er reason's "why?" and "whence?"
                 Discarded all proportion just,
                 And thundered in our ears "I know,"
                 And bellowed in our brains "ye must."*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 181.

In "Why Jesus Wept" our eyes are startled with the following horrid
blasphemy, "The badger Jesus skulketh in his holt,"*1. which, after all, is
not a quarter so blasphemous as to suppose that Jesus, the Son of God, the
Very God, resides in a loaf and a bottle, as the Plymouth brethren did in the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
same satire ­ vide scene xiii. Finally, instead of allowing this most
unfortunate of unfortunate individuals to peacefully ascend to heaven from
two places simultaneously he unfeelingly dismisses him, the Omnipotent, in
a jest.*2.

*1. Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 40.
*2. The Sword of Song, Ascension Day, vol. ii, p. 163.

Crowley further shows, by quoting the parable of the sheep and the goats,
that the historical(?) Christ was to a great extent devoid of pity, and a little
further on in the same poem, "Ascension Day," that he was but a
cantankerous divider and obstreperous upstart:

                                      Give me omnipotence?
              .    .   .   .     .   .     .   .  .   .  .   .
              To call me God ­ I would exert
              That power to heal creation's hurt;
              Not to divide my devotees
              From those who scorned me to the close:
              A worm, a fire, a thirst for these;
              A harp-resounding heaven for those!*

*The Sword of Song, Ascension Day, vol. ii, p. 158.

Concerning the mother of the eternal God, Crowley has little to tell us, and
the Blessed Virgin's affaire du coeur with the amiable Gabriel is but touched
on for a moment:

              "Fear nothing, Mary! All is well!
              I am the angel Gabriel."
              She bared her right breast; (query why?)*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, p. 60; vol. ii, p. 182.
       According to Al Beidâwi, Gabriel blew into the bosom of Mary's shift, which he
opened with his fingers, and his breath reaching her womb, caused the conception.
       It may also be remembered that the Spanish mare, of Silius Italicus was similarly
impregnated by a certain gas or spirit in the atmosphere.

etc., etc., vide Koran. But as regards that most irate and truculent old
gentleman, J.H.V.H., he has a considerable amount to relate.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
How "All Power can be All Wickedness," is a question that not only strikes
Crowley's brain as exceptionally incongruous, but must so strike all who
ever think at all. How God being Almighty as well as Beneficent can tolerate
such a world of suffering as ours for one minute passes all understanding.
The God idea in its infancy, as we have already seen, was the child of
ignorance and revenge, and Jahveh, in his turn, is but an emanation of this
world idea, no better than the rest:

               Baal and Jehovah, Ashtoreth
                       And Chemosh and these Elohim,
               Life's panders in the brothel. Death!
                       Cloudy imaginings, a dream
               Built lip of fear and words and woe.
               All, all my soul must overthrow."*

*Ahab, vol. ii, p. 123.

Crowley further writes:

               Nor can I see what sort of gain
               God finds in this creating pain.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 172.

But man the father of God did, for he was naturally bloodthirsty, avaricious,
and cruel, and man to-day is but a veneered representative of his forefathers,
still suppliant at the feet of the phallic Jahveh:

               That man to-day should not be weaned
               Of worshipping so foul a fiend
               In presence of the living Sun.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 177.

But so it is, and so it will be for many a generation yet to come; cause and
effect are but replicas of each other, and if the cause be ignorance, it is
useless to look for the wisdom of Solomon in the effect; men's gods are but
gilded duplications of themselves, and their ideal but the "resurrection pie"
of past feasting. Man loves the mysterious, and his god is but a poor
_____________________________________________________________________________________
conjuring trick, as is shown in "Pentecost" ­ "a mysterious way... God
moves in to fix up his Maskelyne tricks."*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 168.

Leaving now these satirical poems for other works of Crowley's, we shall
find a deep, yet in no way less, intense hatred for the sham ideal of all
religions. In "Jephthah" we listen to Jephthah praying to Jehovah, god of
hosts, for victory over the Ammonites, not-withstanding the fact that should
victory be his lot a general violation of all the virgins of Ammon was to
follow:

              And turn their own devouring blade
              On city fired and violate maid,*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 74.

Chemosh was probably no whit better than Jahveh, and Jephthah has almost
as firm a belief in the former as in the latter.* In fact, all were as the ground
from which they had sprung and on which they grew.

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 76.

In "The Triumph of Man," a magnificent poem in heroic verse, Crowley
unfurls the oriflamme of Reason against the bunting of God, leading us on
from the realms of gloating anthropophagi to the "magical brotherhood of
kings." The absolute crown and kingdom of desire, the one God sealed in the
seas and betokened in the winds. "The Spirit of Mankind!"

              Before the darkness, earlier than being,
              When yet thought was not, shapeless and unseeing,
              Made misbegotten of deity on death,
              There brooded on the waters the strange breath
              Of an incarnate hatred. Darkness fell
              And chaos, from prodigious gulphs of hell.
              Life, that rejoiced to travail with a man,
              Looked where the cohorts of destruction ran,
              Saw darkness visible, and was afraid,
              Seeing. There grew like Death a monster shade,
              Blind as the coffin, as the covering sod
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Damp, as the corpse obscene, the Christian God.
So to the agony dirges of despair
Man cleft the womb, and shook the icy air
With bitter cries for light and life and love.
But these, begotten of the world above,
Withdrew their glory, and the iron world
Rolled on its cruel way, and passion furled
Its pure wings, and abased itself, and bore
Fetters impure, and stopped, and was no more,
But resurrection's ghastly power grew strong.
And Lust was born, adulterous with Wrong,
The Child of Lies; so man was blinded still,
Garnered the harvest of abortive ill,
For wheat reaped thistles, and for worship wrought
A fouler idol of his meanest thought:
A monster, vengeful, cruel, traitor, slave,
Lord of disease and father of the grave,
A treacherous bully, feeble as malign,
Intolerable, inhuman, undivine,
With spite close girded and with hatred shod,
A snarling cur, the Christian's Christless God.
Out! misbegotten monster! with thy brood,
The obscene offspring of thy pigritude,
Incestuous wedlock with the Pharisees
That hail the Christ a son of thee! Our knees
Bend not before thee, and our earth-bowed brows
Shake off their worship, and reject thy spouse,
The harlot of the world! For, proud and free,
We stand beyond thy hatred, even we:
We broken in spirit beneath bitter years,
Branded with the burnt-offering of tears,
Spit out upon the lie, and in thy face
Cast back the slimy falsehood; to your place,
Ye Gadarean swine, too foul to fling
Into the waters that abound and spring!
Back, to your mother filth! With hope, and youth,
Love, light, and power, and mastery of truth
Armed, we reject you; the bright scourge we ply,
Your howling spirits stumble to your sty:
The worm that was your lie ­ our heel its head

             So, passionate and pure, the strong chant rolls,
             Queen of the mystic unity of souls;
             So from eternity its glory springs
             King of the magical brotherhood of kings;
             The absolute crown and kingdom of desire,
             Earth's virgin chaplet, molten in the fire,
             Sealed in the Sea, betokened by the wind:
             "There is one God, the Spirit of Mankind!"*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 105, 107. The sacred pledge of the
Rosicrucians was: "Man is God and Son of God, and there is no other God but Man."

Such is Aleister Crowley's magnificent contempt for the God ideals of man,
and the Christ ideals of a demented mob. That Christianity has been for the
greater part of fifteen hundred years an immense power, few can deny; that
it has been a power of good, few will deny, though not a few would like to;
that it has been a dragonading power of harm few will assert, and still fewer
are aware of; for it has ever been the craft of the Christian Church to pass off
on her paramours her worn-out old body as that of untasted virginity.

The Catholic Church, the harlot of the seven hills, comes in for sparse
mercy. In Tannhäuser we find the head of this infallible and august body of
swindlers mocked as a mountebank, and his power as a "barren staff."*1. In
"Ascension Day" the whole Christian Church as a lie, "abortion and
iniquity,"*2. whose soldiers are no ardent warriors in triple steel, but loathly
and disgusting worms,*3. who only show fight when cornered and not
always then ­ "speared wild cats bravely spit."*4. Neither does Crowley
spare that anachronism, Present-day Christianity, which fondly imagines it
has succeeded in solving the problem of how to sit on two sides of the fence
at one and the same time, to offer Christ to the simple-minded with the one
hand and drain their pockets with the other. Amennatep's description of the
pathic Ratoum in "The Fatal Force" may fitly be quoted here as an apt
description of modern-day Christianity:

             Her power is gone, and we behold her go,
             Haggard and weary, through the palace courts
             And through the temple, lusting for strange loves
             And horrible things, and thirsting for new steam
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                 Of thickening blood upon her altar steps.
                 Her body wearies of desire, and fails
                 To satisfy the fury of her spirit;
                 The blood feasts sicken her and yield no strength;
                 She is made one with hell, and violent force
                 Slips and is weakness, and extreme desire
                 Spends supple.*5.

Inane revivals stir her muddy waters, as rise gusts of fetid gas from a
disturbed cesspool. Maniacs like Piggott and Evans arise, as also do such
religious Ananiases as Dowie and Torrey; all battening as greedy vultures on
the mental dead, as they take their place on the eternal towers of silence ­
true mutilators of corpses. Ulric in "The Mother's Tragedy," tells Cora that
"Excess is danger, equally in prayer... as in debauchery."*1. And this the
howling mob of religionists can never grasp. We know of the spots in the
Agapae, and we know to what they referred:

                 Out! out! the ghastly torches of the feast!
                 Let darkness hide us and the night discover
                 The shameless mysteries of God grown beast,
                 The nameless blasphemy, the slimèd East--
                 Sin incarnated with a leprous lover!*2.

*2. The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 168.

Whilst these are seeking the "Monstrous desires of secret things,"*1. others
are ranting about athiest death-bed scenes. For these Crowley also has a
word:

                 "Oh, very well!" I think you say,
                 "Wait only till your dying day!
                 See whether then you kiss the rod,
                 And bow that proud soul down to God!"
                 I perfectly admit the fact;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             Quite likely that I so shall act!
             Here's why Creation jumps at prayer.
             You Christians quote me in a breath
             This, that, the other atheist's death;
             How they sought God! Of course! Impair
             By just a touch of fever, chill,
             My health ­ where flies my vivid will?
             My carcass with quinine is crammed;
             I wish South India were damned;
             I wish I had my mother's nursing,
             Find precious little use in cursing,
             And slide to leaning on another,
             God, or the doctor, or my mother.
             But, dare you quote my fevered word
             For better than my health averred?
             The brainish fancies of a man
             Hovering on delirium's brink:
             Shall these be classed his utmost span?
             All that he can or ought to think?
             No! the strong man and self-reliant
             Is the true spiritual giant.
             I blame no weaklings, but decline
             To take their maunderings for mine.*2.

We will now end the poet's utter contempt for this worn-out old creed with
the following:

                                                    ...Vex
             My soul no more with mistranslations
             From Genesis to Revelations,
             But leave me with the Flaming Star
             Jeheshua (see thou Zohar!)
             And thus our formidable Pigeon-
             Lamb-and-old-Gentleman religion
             Fizzles in smoke, and I am found
             Attacking nothing...*

            The Chapter known as

                  The Cup

In which chapter it is related how the Cup held
the "New Wine," and how that wine is quaffed
  greedily by all; and how to some it tasteth
    as bitter as gall, and yet to others is as
       Falernian a hundred and twenty
         years old; for that is the age
           of the cellar from out of
              which it was ta'en.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                 The Cup


IN the last line of "The Star and Garter" is concentrated the whole of the
ethical philosophy of Aleister Crowley. It reads as follows:

      But ­ had it not been for the Garter, I might never have seen
             the Star.

In it we find the sublime maxim, almost universal, which has been
postulated by all the greatest ethical codes of the world. It is the moral
prototype, the Favashi of the Zoroastrian, the Tree of Knowledge of
Babylonia and Genesis, the Light and Darkness of Isaiah, the Yakheen and
Boaz of Solomon, the Unique Athanor of the Qabalist, the Balance of Hegel;
the polarity of the worlds, the great centripetal and centrifugal forces, the
harmony of the spheres, the path of the stars, the life of the universe.

Without Vice there can be no Virtue, without Virtue there can be no Vice.
Without the one, the other becomes absolutely incomprehensible, and
beyond our judgement. Hegel held: "that a thing can only arise through its
opposite," and this idea was also held by the Qabalists. Deity created good
and evil; and both are absolutely necessary to the existence of each other.
Further, the Qabalist does not even recognize their independence as two
opposing powers, but as one under the one Supreme Deity; the external
visible matter world of evil and darkness, and the internal spiritual higher
world of Goodness and Light, beneficent and malevolent as the ancient gods
of Babylonia. The unique Athanor of philosophic and moral alchemy was
the transmutation of darkness into light. "Quand l'homme grandit Dieu
s'éleve" ­ it was but a reconstruction of the same idea as held in Exodus,
xxxiii, Moses was unable to look at God face to face; it was also the same
idea as held by Charles Darwin ­ the theory of Evolution. The growth of the
protoplast into man, of evil into good. Khephra, god of the morning
emerging from the black thunders of night.

Above us flames the Zodiac, the sign of the Balance lies between Virgo and
Scorpio, the eagle is the emblem of good, the scorpion of evil, the eagle-
_____________________________________________________________________________________
winged serpent of Good and Evil; and it is with this doctrine of Good and
Evil that we shall now deal.

As there was darkness before syhla formed the light, and as knowledge is
the outcome of ignorance, so is also virtue the outcome of vice.

          ERITIS SICUT DEUS, SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM.

It was Satan, the Lucifer of Milton, the Devil of Blake, and the Serpent of
Genesis, who was the author of Wisdom.*

*cwdn same as hycm

              And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
       For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
       be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. --Gen. iii,
       4, 5.

It was only by casting off God, and breaking away from the essentially
bestial quality of unreason, that man paradoxically assumed Godhood.
Eliphas Lévi in one of his unpublished letters wrote, "The riddle of the
sphinx has two answers which are true only in a third. `The first is God, the
second is man, and the third Man-God.''' This is but the overman of the
Egoistical philosophy of Nietzsche. Hermes struck a higher chord when he
said: "To create God, is to accomplish our own creation, to make ourselves
independent, impassible, and immortal." Blake demonstrated the at-oneness
of Good and Evil very clearly in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell." "I tell
you no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments," he says,
referring to the Decalogue. Further back in his "Proverbs of Hell," he writes:

       You never know what is enough unless you know what is
              more than enough.
       The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.
       The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
       The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.
       The nakedness of woman is the work of God.
       For everything that lives is Holy.

In Samuel Butler's "Erewhon" we find much the same idea in the following
couplet.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
       He who sins aught sins more than he ought,
       But he who sins naught, has much to be taught.

Blake further writes in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell":

              A man carried a monkey about for a show, and because he was
       a little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conceived himself as
       much wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg: he shows the
       folly of churches and exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are
       religious and himself the single one on earth that ever broke a net.
              Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new
       truth.
              Now hear another: he has written all the old falsehoods.
              And now hear the reason: He conversed with Angels who are
       all religious, and conversed not with the Devils who all hate
       religion...

Goethe, in Faust, also depicted this same moral idea, and most religions have
experienced this unity of Virtue and Vice; the early Christians applauded it,
and even now in Christian Churches is still sung the beautiful hymn:

              Nearer, my God, to thee,
                      Nearer to thee,
              E'en though it be a cross
                      That raiseth me!
              Still all my song shall be
                      Nearer, my God, to thee,
                      Nearer to thee.

To raise oneself through the vicious and the virtuous, to reside, as Adonis
did, six months with Proserpine, and six with Venus, to be as day and night,
winter and summer, is no easy path to tread; and if it be necessary for the
initiate to gaze on the back parts of Jahveh, it is, however, most certainly not
necessary for him to kiss the hind quarters of the goat of Mendes, or to revel
in the secret orgies of the Agapae; for the tempting of man is but the
tempering of the metal.*

*Yet the virtue of one man may be the vice of another.

The flower which springs from the dunghill assimilates into itself particles
of matter, transforming them into the ruby of the poppy and the sapphire of
the cornflower; so with us, it is synthetically that we rise, and not
analytically. Blake grasped this idea and so did Joseph de Maistre. The
Arcanum of Solomon is represented by the two pillars of the temple,
Yakheen and Boaz, the two forces, the white and the black; separate and
contrary, yet in their polarity they are uniform, equilibrating their unity. The
philosopher's stone, as Hermes declared, consisted in separating the ethereal
from that which was gross.

                Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the ethereal from the
       gross, gently, but with great industry.
                It ascends from earth to heaven, and again it comes down from
       heaven to earth, and it is invested with the potency of superior and
       inferior things.
                Thou wilt possess by this means the glory of the whole world,
       and all darkness will depart from thee.
                It is the strong power of every power, for it will overcome all
       things subtle and penetrate all things solid.
                It is thus that the world was created.*

*Hermes.

Tannhäuser also separated the higher from the lower self, the good from the
evil. Christ also attempted the same course, not living alone for either good
or bad, but for the whole, as Jeláládeen sang, "I am the song and singer,"
etc., the surest centre of immortality lying in the whole, and not in the part.
The Qabalist compared the wicked with the excrement of the great human
body, a necessary vivific secretion, and not a poison to the living organism.
Waite tells us: "These excretions also serve as a manure to the earth, which
brings forth fruits to nourish the body; thus death reverts always to life, and
evil itself serves for the renewal and nourishment of good."*1. The most
important of all the arcana of the Magnum opus was the transformation of
darkness into light. Again, we have the white and black triangles, the unique
Athanor of moral alchemy, the transmutation of darkness into light. "The
stone becomes a plant, the plant an animal, the animal a man, and man
greatens into Deity."*2.

*1. The Mysteries of Magic, p. 150.
*2. Ibid., p. 30.

       Nothing is absolutely evil, nothing is accursed for ever, not even the
       archangel of evil, for a time will come when his name and angelic
       nature will be restored to him.*

La Kabbale, Frank, p. 217.

Thus we rise through the microprosopus of good and evil, to the great ethical
macroprosopus which is equilibrated. Many are the tracks and by-paths of
life which lead over the mountains, the swamps, the forests of existence to
that great road, the road of the Soul.

From the supernal flights of Idealism, we now find Crowley in the most
infernal depths of realism striving through a sea of blood towards that
flaming pentacle which flares on the dim horizon of Hope. All is night, yet
all is expectation; herculean is the task, yet the heart is that of a Titan. Blake
saw that "Prisons are built with stones of Law; brothels with bricks of
Religion," and so does Crowley. Both in their sagacity perceive that the one
great crime is that of exclusiveness. The Christian failing to see this,
worshipped the masculine power of wisdom and neglected the feminine
power of Intelligence, his God was as the God of most religions a veritable
He-God, therein lay his fault; the only philosophy perhaps that grasped the
truth was that of the Qabala. The microprosopus was neither masculine nor
feminine, but androgynous; and it was left for William Postel to utter one of
the greatest world truths when he said, "The Word has indeed become man,
but not until the Word has become woman will the world be saved." It is this
that Crowley sets vividly out before us in his following ethical philosophy.

"To behold sin in its naked Deformity, is the most certain method to oblige
us to love Virtue," such is to be read in the prefatory note of a curious little
volume to be found in the British Museum library under the attractive title of
"The prostitution of Quality or Adultery à-la-mode." It was through the
Garter that in the end the Star was seen, in other words it was through the
intimate knowledge of the lewd, bad and vicious, that the tender weeping
heart was discovered; the rough matrix contained a gem of surpassing
beauty, the horny shell a pearl of perfect loveliness. Charicles had to tread
the thorny path before he won his Archais, and so must we, before we can
win knowledge, weep many bitter tears. The incessant search after Truth
carries us through desert lands of misery and oases of temptation, as is only
too vividly illustrated in Tannhäuser.

Aphrodite before she could overcome the wiles of Jove had to seek aid from
Priapus;* thus so have we all to do, we must eat of the "Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil" before we can pluck the fruit of the "Tree of Life."

*The Tale of Archais, vol. i, p. 18.

The mediaeval spiritualism of "Paracelsus" is curiously modernized, if we
may use so crude a word, in the mystical poem "Aceldama." The strife in the
former from the kingdom to the crown, in the latter seems to be that of Vice
towards Virtue, and though quite one of Crowley's earlier poems, it is,
however, one of his most interesting and attractive, and this is how I
interpret it.

A soul standing in the lupanar of life, aspiring to grasp the mystic riddle
from the chilly lips of the eternal sphinx, salutes us, as we open this frail
little volume. Our bodies are not burst asunder as was that of Judas, but our
souls are reft and rent, and in the end know not God from Satan, or which of
these twain have won. "All the dream is wrought a spider-tapestry" yet the
soul stands on the blood-red field of Aceldama:

                                        II.
                      ...whose red banners beat
             Their radiant fire
       Into my shrivelled head, to wither Love's desire?*

*Aceldama, vol. i, p. 2.

The picture becomes grander still, the child of life becomes old in thought:

                                        III.
       I was a child long years ago, it seems,
             Or months it may be ­ I am still a child!
             They pictured me the stars as wheeling wild
       In a huge bowl of water; but my dreams
             Built it of Titan oak, its sides were piled
                      Of fearful wood
       Hewn from God's forests, paid with sweat and tears and blood.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Yet to what does this infinite yearning lead? The soul looks "out to the
beyond," and from the shapeless and unstayed there bursts the cry of
"Nothing," "But evermore came out by the same door wherein I went."* In
verse vi we find the mysticism of Berashith "Nothing was everything"; and
in verse vii, the perfection of life in death "Absorbed my life in His,
dispersed me, gave me death." This is pure Buddhism.

*Omar Khayyám.

In death is found release, freedom from desire, which fools alone reject. In
the spiritual contemplation of life the slags of existence fall to the bottom of
the burning furnace of the human soul; the power of empire and glory is
shattered, "The golden image with the feet of clay," and the marred vessels
of the (All)-mighty potter are cast outside, from the wheel of Fate ­ why
contemplate what is so unprofitable and useless?

Yet in this mysticism which is more intrinsically of the East, we find an
intricate web of Egotism tangled with the utilitarianism of the West; for it
seems on reading further that it is not in mere abstraction of the real, but
rather in the total absorption of the real, that the Nirvana of bliss is to be
arrived at. It is terrible sailing this, Scylla lies to our left, Charybdis to our
right, the blood-flecked foam of life is dashed on our lips, it is acrid and
intoxicating.

                                        XII.
       No prostitution may be shunned by him
              Who would achieve this Heaven. No satyr-song,
              No maniac dance shall ply so fast a thong
       Of lust's imagining perversely dim
              That no man's spirit may keep pace, so strong
                     Its pang must pierce;
       Nor all the pains of hell may be one tithe as fierce.

                                        XIII.
       All degradation, all sheer infamy,
              Thou shalt endure. Thy head beneath the mire
              And dung of worthless women shall desire
       As in some hateful dream, at last to lie;
              Women must trample thee till thou respire
                     That deadliest fume;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
       The vilest worms must crawl, the loathliest vampires gloom.

Dividuality the curse of existence must vanish, and it can only vanish
through the melting of the discordant ego into the harmonious Whole. If we
set ourselves aside on a pillar of purity, we are but dualizing existence, the
lees of the wine must be quaffed in the same cup as the wine itself, there is
no other choice:

                                       XIV.
       Thou must breathe in all poisons; for thy meat,
              Poison; for drink, still poison; for thy kiss,
              A serpent's lips!...

Then the verse continues, and we see if we may so express it, the great
nuptials with the Lords of Lust:

                                         An agony is this
       That sweats out venom; thy clenched hands, thy feet
              Ooze blood, thine eyes weep blood; thine anguish is
                    More keen than death.
       At last ­ there is no deeper vault of hell beneath!

Then comes the great reward. We have travelled knee deep through the mire
of life, yet if our souls he spotless our abasement, "...bringeth back the
sheaves"

                                       XV.
              Of golden corn of exaltation,
              .   .  .    .   .  .    .   .   .   .   .   . .
              With strange intoxications mad and manifold.

It is this curious phase, yearning towards Perfection, which forms the great
stumbling-block to all progress in the life of a soul. Priestcraft has drawn a
definite line between Vice and Virtue; it has hedged itself round with
chastity, veracity, honesty, and modesty, and set itself apart to wage an
incessant war on vice, lechery, mendacity, immodesty, etc., etc. And what
has been the result of this duality? The very fort of virtuous self-sufficiency,
the very citadel of chaste-exclusiveness has become fetid with the horrors of
besiegement, the moats are filled with the putrid carcasses of an unjust war;
fever reigns, vice laughs, the inhabitants starve, sucking the putrid pus from
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the wounds of the dead, and devouring rats and other vermin. Outside in the
Camp of Vice, plague reigns and pestilence rules; yet if the summed evils of
Virtue and Vice were cast into the balance of Truth, who dare say which
would outweigh the other? Everyone knows the degradation as well as the
ennoblements of war; the former ever as some leprous brach licking at her
heels; the latter a halo of sainthood to be cast o'er the skull of the time-
cleansed skeleton, which was once a spongy mass of wriggling larvae.
During his life the thief stole, he lied, and he cheated; pursued, he was
caught, judged, and nailed to a cross, and in death alone was he promised the
subconscious longing of his life ­ Paradise.

This duality of Virtue and Vice has rent the world, as with a sword, and her
garment has been torn asunder. Some say "this is mine!" others "that is
mine!" and so the quarrel rages. Yet will they not unite? for the blending of
Virtue and Vice means the loss of some supposed comfort, and comfort is
the God of man's heart, the Vampire which sucks its life from his shrivelling
soul.

In laughter alone we shall never solve the riddle of life, only in the mingling
of our smiles with our sobs shall we realize the kiss of God on our brow. Yet
the dangers are terrible. How many of us can listen to the voice of Circe
without becoming swine? and in the full melancholy of so vast a
contemplation, the poet sings:

                                      XVIII.
       I dare not to the greater sins aspire;
              I might ­ so gross am I ­ take pleasure in
              These filthy holocausts, that burn to sin
       A damnéd incense in the hellish fire
              Of human lust ­ earth's joys no heaven may win;
                     Pain holds the prize
       In blood-stained hands; Love laughs, with anguish in His eyes.

Also he sees how dangerous it is to sip from the cup of "little common sins."
Sins nurtured by trust in man's forgiveness; then struck with the horror of
the still small voice, he bids God break his unrepentant will, and let the kiss
of life:

                                      XXI.
              Melt on my lips to flame, fling back the gates of Dis!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
This is the true conquest of life, the salvation of a soul wandering through
the mazy depths of existence. At length filled with the experience of worldly
things seeking the Sublime, he finds it. The kingdom of Dis, the terrors of
Death are vanquished, "and, like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a
rack behind."

Yet how difficult is all this without the guidance of a master hand, the hand
which supports but does not hold, directing but never compelling.

Then the Isis of Aceldama is unveiled, and the secret is caught from the age-
worn lips of the Sphinx. On the crimson field of the Exoteric the body of
exclusive Esoterism lies dead, the soul has sloughed the skin of caste, has
riven the fetters of law, has smitten the last head from the hydra of religion;
and rises as an eagle-winged serpent, sublime, neither good nor evil, pristine,
Adamic, immaculate:

                                     XXIV.
       An ecstasy to which no life responds,
             Is the enormous secret I have learned:
             When self-denial's furnace-flame has burned
       Through love, and all the agonizing bonds
             That hold the soul within its shell are turned
                    To water weak;
       Then may desires obtain the cypress crown they seek.

It is only when we lose the cherished present, that it looms up through the
mist of time as a glorious past; and it is only when we have lost the body of
corruption, that its soul rises sublime purifying all; our personality purified
by death the great Time Soul lies cradled in our own as the four lips of two
lovers are in their bridal kiss. Alone by trampling life's grapes do we gain
the vintage of the Soul, the Medean draught of rejuvenescence.

The whole of this wonderful philosophy the poet sums up in the following
two verses of extraordinary and extravagant power:

                                    XXVIII.
       Aubrey attained in sleep when he dreamt this
             Wonderful dream of women, tender child
             And harlot, naked all, in thousands piled
_____________________________________________________________________________________
       On one hot writhing heap, his shameful kiss
              To shudder through them, with lithe limbs defiled
                      To wade, to dip
       Down through the mass, caressed by every purple lip.

                                     XXIX.
       Choked with their reek and fume and bitter sweat
              His body perishes; his life is drained;
              The last sweet drop of nectar has not stained
       Another life; his lips and limbs are wet
              With death-dews! Ha! The painter has attained
                      As high a meed
       As his who first begot sweet music on a reed.

Love alone is immortal, love for the good, love for the bad. Redolent with
divinity, it floats onward through life, through heaven, through hell, till the
flaming forms of Paolo and Francesca rise before us, an everlasting answer
to the eternal word of Love.

              Nay? kiss in double death-pang, if you dare!
              Or one day I will strangle you within
                      My heavy hair!*

*Aceldama, vol. i, p. 6.

Slowly, and solely through temptation can man be purified. Burns, who was
possessed with the happiest knack of striking the nail full on the head,
driving it home at one blow, describes this well in his "Address to the Unco
Gude":

                      What's done we partly may compute
                           But kenna what's resisted.

It is this resistance alone which sanctifies man, body and soul. There is
sparse morality in the well-fed, the well-housed, the well-dressed, their
existence is indolent, comfortable, affluent; but in the ill-fed, the houseless,
the unclothed, there may be much. There is nothing sublime in an oily
gourmet passing a baker's shop without wishing to steal a loaf; but in a
hungry child whose hollow bowels growl for food the opportunity of theft if
resisted is noble. The sleek, smiling society hostess has no need to frequent
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the streets for gain, but who dare say that the poor hounded outcast has not?
HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU, LET HIM FIRST CAST A
STONE AT HER.

Even the Scribes and Pharisees, who were thus rebuked, departed in silence,
convicted by their own conscience; but not so our modern Christian canaille,
from the Pope and the Archbishop and the Patriarch downwards. O,
Christians! you daily crucify your Saviour, hourly you drive the rusty nails
through His outstretched hands, O "maudite race!" "WHOSE GOD IS
THEIR BELLY, WHOSE GLORY IS IN THEIR SHAME, WHO MIND
EARTHLY THINGS."

Temptation is the Armourer who tries the blade, and Resistance the quality
of the steel. How many of the well-fed will bear the test of old Andrea? How
many would prove themselves a worthy blade to Ferrara?

Sadness stares around us with hollow tear-drowned eyes, and the days of our
joys are wet with the weeping of the night of sorrow. On, on we plod,
through life's by-ways and alleys, through mud and slime, onward we must
go if we are ever to win the gates of Wisdom and Understanding and attain
the Kingdom of the Holy Crown. "Self" we must slay, it is the great sin of
life:*1. "The scorpion kisses, and the stings of sin, cling hard within."*2.
The small still voice calls to us, yet we must overcome it, in its conquest
alone lies our salvation. "Truth" is our St. George, whose sword is as keen as
his of "The Nameless Quest," and "Self" the dragon which we must slay:

*1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 50.

       Central, supreme, most formidable, Night
                 Gathered its garments, drew itself apart;
       Gaunt limbs appear athwart the coprolite,
                 Veil the deep agony, display the heart;
                        Even as a gloomy sea,
                        Wherein dead fishes be,
       Poisonous things, nameless; the eightfold Fear,
                        Misshapen crab and worm,
                        The intolerable sperm,
       Lewd dragons, slime-built. Stagnant, the foul mere
                        Crawled, moved, gave tongue,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                       The essential soul of dung
                       That lived and stung;
       That spoke: no word that living head may hear!
                       .   .     .    . .    .  .  .  .
                       Last, a dark woman pressed
                       The world unto her breast,
                       Soothed and caressed
       With evil words and kisses of the mouth of Sin.*

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p 198.

On we must press, undaunted, against all odds and numbers, as in the
spiritual journey towards the Supreme of "The Ultimate Voyage," struggling
with the cold wet horrors of life:

                                             ...with my sword
              Trenchant, that tore their scaly essences--
              Like Lucian's sailor writhing in the clutch
              Of those witch-vines ­ I slashed about like light,
              And noises horrible of death devoured
              That hateful suction of their clinging arms
              And wash of slippery bellies...*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 97.

Life is a boiling cauldron of purposes, actions, and desires. At one moment
all pessimistic with the "toad-spotted dew"*1. of Reality, at the next all full-
hearted optimism, "Yet I believe what e'er we do is best for me and best for
you";*2. then as stoical as Marcus, "I conquer, and most silently await the
end."*3.

*1. The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 178.
*2. The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 155.
*3. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 52.

All phases of thought are crowded on our minds as we read through these
slight volumes. And what is the goal of this "Ultimate Voyage?" A deep and
tearless sadness, a growing wonder of how such luxury, such wealth, such
satiety can exist cheek by jowl with such squalor, such poverty, such want.
Is there a God? Could there be a God? A power of Light compatible with
_____________________________________________________________________________________
such dismal darkness. Is there a life eternal? The grim horror of such a
possibility grips us by the throat. Is there an eternal Death? Ah! Saviour,
deliver us from the misery of our lot; lead us to the realms of eternal Rest,
where rich and poor, good and bad, are made one, lost in the depths of the
Lethean sea.

And what can all this lead us to, this progress through misery? To the great
archetype the Arahat-ship of Buddha. It was by gazing on the sunken eyes of
a corpse, so the legend runs, that Gautama forsook pleasure for a life of pity.
Life is feodal to Death, and our ultimate sleep is greater than our first
awakening. The womb was dark; from out it sprang the thoughtless; the
tomb is darker still; into it creeps the thoughtful. The dead are our gods,
soon we shall strike our tent for the last time and join the great caravanserai
of the departed:

       Wend now thy way with brow serene, fear not thy humble tale
             to tell--
       The whispers of the Desert-wind; the tinkling of the camel's
             bell.*

*The Kasîdah. R. Burton.

This beauty of Death as the releaser from the temptations of life, is finely
drawn by the subtle pen of Aleister Crowley. Death is no longer the grub-
slimed skull, about whose sticky lips buzz the blue blow-flies of decay; but
rather a divine goddess, whose arms are ever about us, and whose kiss is the
kiss of a mother closing the eyes of her child in gentle sleep:

             I died the moment when you tore away
                    The bleeding veil of my virginity.
                          The pain was sudden ­ and the joy was long.
                    Persists that triumph, keenly, utterly!
                          Write, then, in thy mysterious book of song:
             "Death chisels marble where life moulded clay."*

And again:

_____________________________________________________________________________________
                     Our slow ecstatic breath,

                     How beautiful is Death.*

Thus in this cup which Aleister Crowley offers us, we find that to sip the
honey of Virtue is to quaff the wormwood of Vice; they are one, and there
must be no comparison. Outside our minds exists neither one nor the other,
alone there is Power, Eastwards it verges towards Virtue, Westwards
towards Vice ­ Heaven and Hell ­ yet in neither is there vitality, for
absolutes are without change. Our lives are vital because of the mingling of
many dregs; and as in the death of these we can alone check vitality or
change, so also in that greater Death can we alone solve the mystery of pure
being. Virtue and Vice they are one, being formless and eternal without time
or number; for whilst we live death is not, and the purities of state cannot be.
We live in a land of mingled cloud and flame, on the marge of the kingdoms
of the Positive and the Transcendent, all is as a seething cauldron of
finalities; ever boiling up to vanish in the inane. Optimism and Pessimism,
the former proffering to us the golden chalice filled with the vanities of life,
the latter a leaden cup replete with the excretum of existence.

"Away, away, out of my sunlight," waved Diogenes; he saw before him a
man, only a man full of brains and bowels. The maidens of Athens laughed
at him, wizened misogynist and dreary sage, yet even the most beautiful of
these monthly would spill her crimson libation to the moon. "Yea! truly,
away, away, out of my sight, O shadow of a king; but last night wert thou
not fingering the delicate chalice of Campaspe, and a few hours hence will
not thy drowsy hand crimson the white womb of thy Mother Earth with the
red lees of the grape of Bacchus, so full of the poppies of sleep, and the
wormwood of sorrow."

From the silver goblet of laughter, that leaden cup of weeping, have the
nations drunk the dregs of many lives: for the woman arrayed in purple and
scarlet, and decked with pearls and precious stones, hath made them drunk
on the golden cup of her abominations, on the wine of her fornications, on
the filthy philtres of her whoredoms; and they have become truculent, and
boisterous, and mad; cloaking the silken nakedness of the day with their
woollen shroud of darkness, and seeking in the depths of night the mysteries
of everlasting light.

O Dweller in the Land of Uz, thou also shalt be made drunken, but thy cup
shall be hewn from the sapphire of the heavens, and thy wine shall be
crushed from the clusters of innumerable stars; and thou shalt make thyself
naked, and thy white limbs shall be splashed with the purple foam of
immortality. Thou shalt tear the jewelled tassels from the purse of thy
spendthrift Fancy, and shalt scatter to the winds the gold and silver coins of
thy thrifty Imagination; and the wine of thy Folly shalt thou shower midst
the braided locks of laughing comets, and the glittering cup of thine Illusions
shalt thou hurl beyond the confines of Space over the very rim of Time.

Thou O seeker after Wisdom, and Virtue, and multiscient Truth, thou O
wanderer in the groves of Eleusis, thou, even thou shalt drink of the wine of
Iacchus, and thy cup shall be as a triple flame set with sapphire, and beryl,
and amethyst; for it is the cup of Adepts, and of Heroes, and of Gods. Then
all the absinthial bitterness of thine heart shall vanish midst the chaunting of
souls lost in the ocean of understanding for ever and everlasting.

From the filthy distillations of thy life, and the golden traffic of its
quintessential lusts; from the fantastic dews of thy death, and all the gibbous
glitter of its mirific mirror, shalt thou be purified: and thy cup shall be as the
cusps of the hornéd moon, and thy wine as the blood of the spheres trodden
by the angels of God, singing, singing, singing, throughout all Eternity.

Thy joy shall be as the kiss of new-born suns, and thy bliss as a flaming
cloud of bridal stars. Thou shalt sit on the throne of Time in the centre `twixt
the four corners of the Universe; and in thy left hand shalt thou hold the
Balances of Being, in which thou shalt weigh the suns, and moons, and all
the hosts of heaven; and thy foot-stool shall be the Abyss, and thy sceptre a
sword of flaming fire, thy crown the Zodiac set with the flashing Stone of
the Wise. Robed in glory, and wisdom, and understanding, a light of
loveliness, thou, God-voiced with thunder and lightning, shalt breathe forth
words of fire to flame forever through the empyrean of heaven and to
resound without ceasing beyond the nadir of hell. Thou shalt plunge into the
mystery of all things and become as a Sun unto thyself, and with thine own
beams shalt thou paint the hueless ocean of thy Godhead. Thou shalt see
things as they are; and all shall dissolve around thee, and thou around all, till
unity itself become but nothingness in the unutterable bliss of a boundless
rapture.

ALL philosophies when ultimately reduced to their simplest terms fall either
under the subjective or objective systems of thought.*2. The former is
ontologic, the latter empiric: the first descends from fiction, whilst the
second rises from fact; both, paradoxical as it may seem, are at one and the
same time contradictory and identical, merging into a perfect unity, not in
the realms of a spiritual or material monism, but in those of a Hylo-Idealistic
philosophy, which is Agnostic, and from thence into a Self-Illuminism
which baffles definition.

*1. Argument: This chapter attempts to show how all philosophies may be equated in
corresponding terms of each other; and how the philosophic principles of Berkeley and
Hume, combined, form what may be known as the philosophical theme of Crowleyanity,
in which it is demonstrated how all systems are inwardly mystically identical, and
outwardly sceptically diverse. Further, how by the study of Berkeley, Hume, and Kant,
taken unitedly or separately, the conclusion which is arrived at is, that the Reason alone is
inadequate to solve the Great Problem; for ultimately all systems based on a Rational
foundation arrive at an inscrutable mystery ­ "God," "A Something," "An à priori,"
beyond which they cannot penetrate. Where Agnosticism and Scientific Buddhism end,
Crowleyanity begins. By Qabalistically tackling the question, it proposes a Future to all
Rational Philosophies, thereby becoming a mystical theurgy, whereby the difficulties set
in motion by the conceptions of "Infinite" and "Eternal" are overcome by the annihilation
of Time and Space, and the reduction of all rational terms to an absolute inertia in zero.
From here Crowleyanity becoming purely mystical becomes symbolic, leading those who
follow into the Kingdom of the Adepts; and finally showing how the keynote of all
mystical systems of either East or West, is to be found in Ecstasy; and how the former,
arriving at this sublime state by purely mechanical methods, are not so suitable to those
Western nations as their own poetic mysticism, as found in the divine works of the
Christian Fathers, the Alchymistic Philosophers, and the Mystical Poets of Ancient and
Modern times.
*2. There is an old saying, "All men are born either Platonists or Aristotelians."

For many centuries now, European thought has been labouring under the
damnosa hereditas of foregone conclusions. And as religion in the attempt
to anthropomorphise power, through the medium of dialectic symbols, lost
all footing and plunged headlong into the pandemoniac majesty of Deity, so
philosophy, losing all grip of reality by clutching the illusive realism of its
own creative faculties, was itself whirled into that furnace of hereditary
_____________________________________________________________________________________
prejudice, and educational bias, from out of which it has flowed a mass of
molten and subservient acquiescence. Lost in the axiomatic whirlpools of
egotistical conceit, it has been cast up once again on the shores of
unknowable despair, a veritable mass of philosophic pig-iron, of no further
use than that of acting as ballast to the good ship which is to carry us across
the turbid ocean of raging Eclectics.

Crowley is more than a new-born Dionysus, he is more than a Blake, a
Rabelais or a Heine; for he stands before us as some priest of Apollo,
hovering `twixt the misty blue of the heavens, and the more certain purple of
the vast waters of the deep. Before the name of That which is beyond life
and death, beyond matter and energy, beyond the human and the mortal; he
stands, holding before us as a standard, the homologue of the Labarum of
old, "In hoc signo vinces... Non timendum est Veritate duce."

In order to cut a long story short, it may be assumed that so-called modern
philosophy finds its founder in the French philosopher Descartes; for it was
he who started to unravel the Penelope web of tangled philosophic thought,
which had lain sleeping for a thousand years or more upon the sterile shelf
of Christian impotence.

His theories of "Innate ideas" raised the anger of Locke, the disciple of
Aristotle and Bacon. Revolting from the cognito ergo sum of Descartes, he
compared the mind to a tabula rasa, on which he in his turn wrote an equal
absurdity in the words: nihil est in intellectu quod non antea fuerit in sensu.
Leibnitz in his day, perceiving the weakness in this axiom, extended its
phraseology, but in no way its meaning, by adding Excipi nisi ipse
intellectus. This weakness in Locke's system became only too apparent to
his followers; and Berkeley, as well as Hume, and later still Kant himself,
travelling by slightly different roads, ultimately arrived at the same
destination: "we cannot go beyond experience."

In the first half of the last century Kant's immediate successors, such as
Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, swinging round this central point of attraction,
though viewing it from different positions, ultimately, like moths round a
candle, fell spluttering into the socket, burnt by that same flame they were
attempting to explain away. Nevertheless, though at first their Narcissus-like
self-worship may seem to have been productive of little good, at least,
however, it has brought to blossom one irrefragable and irrefutable fact, and
that is: that in some apparently unknown plane, sensation can be other than
_____________________________________________________________________________________
subjective, i.e., in the subject, in other words, that subjective creation can
outstep its own creator and vice versa. For there is a

                                         sense sublime
             Of something far more deeply interfused,
             Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
             And the round ocean and the living air,
             And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;
             A motion and a spirit, that impels
             All thinking things, all objects of all thoughts,
             And rolls through all things.*

*Wordsworth.

To the uninitiated this matter must for the present remain dark, and though at
first the neophyte may think that the following solution, which I trust I shall
be able in some little way to explain, is but one on a similar footing to that as
set forward by those supernaturalists who dogmatize concerning credo quia
absurdum, I must bid him now at the very outset remember, that "except he
become as a little child, he can in no way enter into the kingdom of heaven";
and further, becoming as a little child it must be remembered that it is as
child-like to grasp at that which alone can be solved "in the alembic of the
heart, and through the athanor of affliction," as it is for a child to grasp a
loaded gun, wotting not of its subtle machinery. For a man becoming as a
child, may, like that child which he has become, play with that loaded
weapon, nurse that loaded weapon, go to bed with that loaded weapon,
expecting nothing of so innocent a toy; and then one day as he presses his
fetish fondly to his heart, there is a deafening crash; and that child who was
once a man, flashes up through the golden gates of Paradise, or is hurled
headlong down to Hell. He may become spontaneously, in the twinkling of
an eye, a St. Francis preaching to his little sisters the birds, or Egg-Nogg
who persists in a state of abnormal flatulency, because he considers himself
identical with a bottle of ginger-beer.

The state of illumination above mentioned is by no means an easy one to
attain to, and the study of philosophy alone helps us, if we follow it under
the shaded light of a critical scepticism; for as a chemist reduces his
compounds to their component parts, and then to their elementary
conditions; so must we dissect all philosophic arguments which rise up
antagonistic to our true selves ­ that is in harmony with our false selves ­
_____________________________________________________________________________________
seducing our sense to pluck the fruit which is pleasant to the eye, or inducing
our understanding in despair, to cast itself down from the pinnacle of the
temple into that abyss below, which is the world. Then in the end we shall
find all these philosophies are but types of the One, that all things are a
unity, that no contradiction can or does exist, and that there is a universal
harmony; then, as that terrific night engulfs all and envelops us, O children
of the Day! Let us rise up with the whole dawn of our understanding,
encircle and annihilate this dismal unity, and conglobe all into a perfect
nothingness, an ineffable bliss ­ attainment is ours.

              It matters little whether we
              With Fichte and the Brahmins preach
              That Ego-Atman sole must be;
              With Schelling and the Buddha own
              Non-Ego-Skandhas are alone;
              With Hegel and ­ the Christian? teach
              That which completes, includes, absorbs
              Both mighty unrevolving orbs
              In one informing masterless
              Master-idea of consciousness--
              All differences as these indeed
              Are chess play, conjuring. "Proceed!"
              Nay! I'll go back. The exposition
              Above, has points. But simple fission
              Has reproduced a different bliss,
              At last a heterogenesis!*

*Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 170.

Many roads lead to Philosophy and branch forth from it, as Crowley above
shows, and in a short essay like this we intend but to travel through the
labyrinthine mysteries of all by the silken clue of one, handed us by Aleister
Crowley. And as there are many by-ways, corridors, and blind alleys in this
great labyrinth of Parnassus, so in this clue, which has been given us, we
shall find many twisted threads, yet all of one fibre, which will lead us, the
weary wanderers in the mysteries, to that certain and blissful kingdom which
shall be our beginning.

Kant has said, the business of all philosophy is to answer the question "What
can I know?" Huxley, perhaps the astutest philosopher since the days of the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
magus of Königsberg, observes that it is impossible to answer the question
"What can I know?" unless in the first place there is a clear understanding of
what is meant by knowledge, and in order to answer this question, "we must
have recourse to that investigation of mental phenomena, the results of
which are embodied in the science of psychology."* But the true crux of all
philosophic arguments lies, as we hope shortly to show, in a still deeper
problem than this, namely: "What is the 'I` which causes us to know?" For
surely it is but common-sense to first inquire of the engineer how the engine
is worked, instead of blundering in attempts to do so for ourselves, without
knowledge, or even the necessary instruction as to the subtle adjustment of
the different parts. And it is on account of the want of this "I" that all science
resting on the inquiry "What do I know?" without the "I" being analytically
disclosed, must, and does, rest upon knowledge purely accidental or
hypothetical.

*Huxley's Essay on Hume, p. 59.

It is quite as possible for hypothetical arguments to be rightly and wrongly
applied, as it is for mechanical tools. A pick-axe is a most useful implement
in levelling a road, and equally a most useless one in mending a watch; so
also with hypothetical arguments, a subtle and illuminated mystic will
discard such mean scaffolding, or at least attain such a perfection in the art
of constructing his temple of the Holy Ghost as in time to be able to do
without such mental timber. Such scaffold poles are those which support and
buttress up the frail edifice of science on the mud of ignorance, in which it
and its superstructure will eventually be engulfed; for its whole foundation
reposes upon the unequilibrated illusions of the mind, which so long as their
influences remain unbalanced, stand as impediments in the way of the
inward development of the human race.* And as the gigantic edifice of the
Christian Church was the child of the neuropathic mystagogues of the dark
ages of religion, so now the colossal fabric of Scientific Utilitarianism,
offspring of a distorted and epileptic steam-mania, has bemerded us with its
panting slime, and wound us tight in the arachnoid meshes of its
kakodemoniacal web, until we stand before ourselves, no longer homo
sapiens, but alone, naked and unadorned, a cinder-sprinkled, soot-
besmeared, spider-legged, homo ridiculissimus!

*Science here as a method is not attacked. For as such, scientific investigations have
always triumphed over mystical aspirations, which to say the least, have been chaotic in
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the extreme. Crowley is never tired of urging a scientific study or the conditions of
illumination as the one hope of mastering the subject.

Periodically as the adepts soar above vulgar appreciation, and when vulgar
understanding has, swine-like, trodden their pearls of wisdom back into the
mud of its own sty, a great wave of materialism sweeps over the face of the
globe. This system of thought, built on the illusive phantasmagoria of the
mind, found in the West a master-mind to mould it into shape, in the
personality of Democritus of Abdera; and from the day when that sage
materialized the creations of his brain to that of Büchner and the present-day
mud-larks, it has formed the stumbling-block to nearly every great thinker,
and the veritable pus puriens of the common mind. However, out of the
slough grew, as must always happen, a subtle plant; and in the form of
Newton, whose scientific demonstration of auto-kineticism, many ages
previously adumbrated by Empedocles and Democritus, gave the death-blow
to that Empiricism, which may be typified in Locke's assertion that "motion
and figure are really in the manna," to which Berkeley attributed a purely
mental existence; for he asserts again and again that the only substantial
existence is the hypothetical substratum of mind, i.e., spirit.* And this, as
Huxley himself states, if pushed to its logical extreme, passes into pantheism
pure and simple; and thus through objecting to Locke's primary qualities as
things in themselves, Berkeley returns, through the objection, back to the
causa sui, or better, ratio sui of Spinoza, the spiritual twin of Locke.

*All these philosophers end in the same quandary as the old gentleman who with only
one tooth in his mouth tried to spike a pickled onion.

I have taken some little trouble to arrive at this one isolated conclusion, that
the Realism of the scholastic philosophers, the materialism of the classical
and modern sages, and also, if we choose to extend our scheme,
Nominalism,         Conceptualism,          Theism,    Positivism,     Spiritualism
(Malebranche), Agnosticism (Spencer), all and one, with all the other isms,
may, with the slightest trouble in the world, be equated into corresponding
terms of Berkeleyan Idealism. And why? Because each individual master,
each separate school, like the astronomer in the fable, whilst gazing at his
own particular star, fell into the open ditch which yawned unperceived at his
feet. And Berkeley: is he the Ultima Thule, the stone of the wise? By no
means, only I, in the above case, chose to represent the ditch by Berkeley;
you may call it Büchner, Spencer, or Hume, for you my readers, if you with
sufficient patience pursue what I will now call Crowleyanity* to its ultimate
_____________________________________________________________________________________
end, will find that William Shakespeare of Avon was not the only man in
this fair world who doubted not that by any other name a rose would smell
as sweet.

*Not only the lever of Archimedes, but also the fulcrum he could not discover.

Let us now take an infinite series A,B,A,B,A,B. The question asked is:
which is first, A or B? And the answer depends entirely upon the direction of
thought. Science will say that intelligence is last, and that matter slowly
evolves into animal life; in fact, that matter (A) is first, and intelligence (B)
is second. The idealists and sankhyâs will put intelligence (B) first, and the
series will run B,A,B,A,B,A. Both, however, are indicating the same chain;
but Crowley,* like the philosophers of the Vedanta, strides beyond both
intellect and matter to find an "I" (purusha) or self, which is beyond all
intellect, and of which intellect is but the borrowed light, as Patanjali says in
one of his yoga aphorisms: "The seer is intelligence only, and though pure,
sees through the colouring of the intellect."

*This is the earlier Fichtean Crowley, though he has already passed through Schelling to
Hegel, and grouped this triad in one, as it were Fichte in excelsis; not the middle, who has
called the triad "Schelling"; still less the latter, who, perceiving the antinomies of reason,
dismisses alike the data and conclusions of all the sciences with an all-embracing
scepticism, while he devotes life to the perfecting of an instrument by whose aid we may
eventually be able to make a fresh start.

In "Pentecost," Crowley writes:

                You know for me the soul is nought
                Save a new phantom in the thought,
                That thought itself impermanent,
                Save as a casual element
                With such another may combine
                To form now water and now wine;
                The element itself may be
                Changeless to all eternity,
                But compounds ever fluctuate
                With time or space or various state.
                (Ask chemists else!) So I must claim
                Spirit and matter are the same
                Or else the prey of putrefaction.*

And we intend to take it as such, otherwise, like Mysticus, we, if we enter
the vortex of subjectivity and objectivity, "shall be tossed about as the world
this 2,500 years."*

                                       IDEALISM

In the philosophy of Plato idealism took the shape of a strictly formal
characteristic, there was nothing in itself, as Kant might have explained it, an
idea however dating back long before either Plato or Kant, and to be first
found in any degree of maturity in the Upanishads of post-vedic India. Form
was reality, and nothing else, it was the sole and only essence. From such
metaphysics rose numerous modified forms which may he roughly classed
under the name of Spiritualism (Malebranche). They asserted that matter
objectively was illusion or maya, and that the world problem could only be
considered as a reality subjectively in the thoughts as "thinks," in fact the
world real was simply an elaboration of these "thinks." These spiritualistic
philosophies stagnating for a time were soon mystified by man's inherent
longing for the wonderful,* and developed into various systems of Spiritism
and Mysticism, both high and low. Of the latter the most renowned, and in
many ways the most profound, was the Philosophy of the Qabalah.

*"The imagination of man is naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is remote and
extraordinary, and running without control into the most distant parts of space and time in
order to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered too familiar to it." --An Enquiry
concerning Human Understanding, Hume (Religion of Science Library), p. 172.

The Qabalah, if it may be called a philosophy; for it was never synthetical,
or concrete, being a conglomerated mass of ecstatic ideals and exalted
desires, evolved in the mind of man as an attempt to grasp all possible
quantities emanating from the Ain Soph, which in itself remained Zero.

Turning now for a short time from the Mystic to the Idealistic philosophy,
we find that though both are closely united, the former founds its system on
man's wondering ignorance in trying to link subject and object esoterically,
whilst the latter builds up reality in mind perceptions, treating nothing as
illusion but the reality of the materialists. Berkeley, when he declared in his
_____________________________________________________________________________________
transcendental philosophy that esse=percipi was only in reality reiterating
the idea held ages previously in "The Veil of Maya." Kant threw more fuel
on the Berkeleyan argument when he stated in his "Critique of Pure
Reason," that we can have no positive knowledge whatsoever of "the thing
in itself." Since then this idea of the subjectivity of reality has gained more
ground under Hegel, and later in numerous works dealing directly or
indirectly with Spiritual Monisms. Even in the middle of the eighteenth
century, forty years after Berkeley had stimulated the dry bones of this
problem into a vigorous existence, materialism waged but a losing, or at best
an unprogressive war against it. Holbach himself had to admit that, though
he considered Berkeley's arguments as sheer sophisms, they nevertheless
remained unanswerable... Idealism may not be correct, neither may its
intenser form Spiritualism; but so far as this argument is of value, neither
may Realism nor Materialism; for both these philosophies have, as we have
just seen, resolved themselves into an infinite chain of events, which may be
expressed under the symbolization of A,B,A,B,A,B, the ultimate issue being
the triumph of Agnosticism.

All the wisest from all ages with all their wisdom finally have had to utter
"We Know Not," and write "ignoramus" across their life's work. Yet is not
this infallibly as it must be, if we search for an absolute truth by relative
means; we cannot prove that it does not exist, any more than we can prove
that it does; for if we dare to attempt to tread so thorny a path with the
utmost success the land we reach is but the land of Weissnichtwo.

The world does not exist outside me. I am the world; but what am I? Herein
lies the greatest of riddles.

This question, this gigantic "What?" Crowley sets forth lucidly enough in
"Pentecost" and "Ascension Day." He writes:

              To calculate one hour's result
              I find surpassing difficult;
              One year's effect, one moment's cause;
              What mind could estimate such laws?
              Who then (much more!) may act aright
              Judged by and in ten centuries' sight?*

of us to hanker after infinite ideals with our finite minds. As a child cries for
the moon, so do we cry for our ideal, ultimate, absolute, call it what you
will; the First Cause in Philosophy, the God of Religion. In the end our finite
understandings burst like bubbles.

The rampant positivism of to-day is so drunk on the spume of the oceanic
knowledge of the deep, that it sees no further than the tip of its own glowing
nose, upon which roseate point it hypnotises itself into a hypermnemonic
state of "Knowallableness"; this, if not more so is certainly quite as fatuous a
standpoint to hold as that of Spencer, in his philosophy of the
"Unknowable." Both are dogmatisms, and as such condemn the very object
of their existence.

It is seldom remembered that the Infinite need not necessarily mean the
boundless; for there is the infinitely small, just as there is the infinitely great,
as Crowley states in Aceldama;

              The inmost is the home of God. He moulds Infinity.
              The great within the small, one stainless unity!*

*Aceldama, vol. i, p. 4.

The power of the small is grandly described in the following;

              Yet ants may move the mountain; none is small
              But he who stretches out no arm at all;
                      Toadstools have wrecked fair cities in a night,
              One poet's song may bid a kingdom fall.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 110.

And that which is below is as that which is above; for:

              Time is to us the Now, and Space the Here;
              From us all Matter radiates, is a part
              Of our own thoughts and souls.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 119.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
So we see:

              For Gods, and devils too, I find
              Are merely modes of my own mind!*

*Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 177.

"All is illusion," says Criosda.* I and further in that weird play ­ "The God-
Eater" ­ we already heard him solemnly utter:

*The God Eater, vol. ii, p. 138.

              Mystery ninefold closed upon itself
              That matter should move mind ­ Ay! Darker yet
              That mind should work on matter? And the proof
              Extant, implicit in the thought thereof!
              Else all our work were vain. These twain be one.*

*The God Eater, vol. ii, p. 134.

In these five lines we find a clinching of the whole argument. "These twain
be one." No more than this did Berkeley ever arrive at:

"But, though it were possible that solid, figured, movable substances may
exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet
how is it possible for us to know this? Either we must know it by sense or by
reason."* He never denied the material existence of things, and was as much
a phenomenalist as an idealist. Crowley, similarly accepting Egoity, does not
however reject Non-egoity, but envelops both.

*The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 39. (Religion of Science Library.)

              In such a conflict I stand neuter.
              But oh! Mistake not gold for pewter!
              The plain fact is: materialise
              What spiritual fact you choose,
              And all such turn to folly­ lose
              The subtle splendour, and the wise
              Love and dear bliss of truth. Beware
              Lest your lewd laughter set a snare
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             For any! Thus and only thus
             Will I admit a difference
             `Twixt spirit and the things of sense.
             What is the quarrel between us?
             Why do our thoughts so idly clatter?
             I do not care one jot for matter,
             One jot for spirit, while you say
             One is pure ether, one pure clay.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 183.

In pure Idealism, objects have no independent existence; but in the above,
which is no less than pure Hylo-Idealism, they have. Yet none to the
individual brain, until they have been brought into reciprocal relationship to
it. If the outer world is an illusion, then the inner world of self is but a
delusion, a mere mirrored reflection of shadows cast by some blinding sun;
so hope some of us, as Orpheus did when he sang:

             This world is shadow-shapen of
                     The bitterness of pain.
             Vain are the little lamps of love!
                     The light of life is vain!
             Life, death, joy, sorrow, age and youth
             Are phantoms of a further truth."*

*The Argonauts, iv, vol. ii, p. 110.

This is but the chant of the Brahmin and the Buddhist as it has risen and
fallen over the East for hundreds and thousands of years.

       There no sun shines, no moon, nor glimmering star,
       Nor yonder lightning, the fire of earth is quenched,
       From him, who alone shines, all else borrows its brightness,
       The whole world bursts into splendour at his shining.
                                                  --Kâthaka Upanishad, v, 15.

The veil of Maya shrouds the true aspect of things; it cuts off the outer from
the inner world, rendering the former esoteric, and the latter exoteric. This
idea of the All as the One, is magnificently described in "The Ultimate
Voyage," when the Voice of God ­ the voice of the Soul that is ­ says:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              "The last and greatest is within you now."
              Then fire too subtle and omniscient
              Devoured our substance, and we moved again
              Not down, nor up, but inwards mystically
              Involving self in self, and light in light.
              And this was not a pain, but peaceable
              Like young-eyed love, reviving; it consumed
              And consecrated and made savour sweet
              To our changed senses. And the dual self
              Of love grew less distinct, and I began
              To feel her heart in mine, her lips in mine...
              Then mistier grew the sense of God without,
              And God was I, and nothing might exist,
              Subsist, or be at all, outside of Me,
              Myself Existence of Existences.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 98.

This magnificent passage is the very consummation of idealism. The sense
of God the crude outer reality growing dim, dimmer, and yet more dim; till
finally it is absorbed in Self. And yet when we with our five senses, search
for a pure ideal, an absolute truth, a God outside of ourselves, our failure is
certain.

To attempt such a course is but to leap into the inane, and he who should set
out on the search for God in realms trod alone by reason, is as certain of
destruction as he who with mortal foot should attempt to walk the billowy
waves of the Galilean sea. Tannhäuser's falsely expressed aspirations begot
within him the Venusberg; seeking for that which was beneath his own true
self, he failed; and it was not till he awoke from the dream of God, that he
was able to free himself from the drear arms of Materialism. So with us, not
until we wake from the God-drunken carouse of the night, and ourselves
become as Gods, shall we conceive God. Hic labor, hoc opus est:

              This is my secret ­ in a man's delight
              To lose the stubborn ecstasy for God!
              To thus clear knowledge hath my path been trod
              In deepest hell ­ in the profoundest sky!
              This knowledge, the true immortality,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               I came unto through pain and tears,
               Tigerish hopes, and serpent loves, and dragon fears,
               Most bitter kisses, salted springs and dry;
               III those deep caverns and slow-moving years,
               When dwelt I, in the Mount of Venus, even I!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 256.



                                  CROWLEYANITY

Quod utilius Deus patefieri sinet, quod autem majoris momenti est, vulgo
adhuc latet usque ad Eliae Artistae adventum quando is venerit.

God will permit a discovery of the highest importance to be made, it must be
hidden till the advent of the artist Elias. Thus prognosticated Paracelsus,*
and further that divine philosopher predicted:

*Paracelsus once assured the students of Avicenna and Galen that his shoe-ties knew
more than these two physicians; and that all the universities, and all the writers united
were less instructed than the hairs of his beard. How much more now so Crowley.

Hoc item verum est nihil est absconditum quod non sit retegendum: ideo,
post me veniet cujus magnale nundum vivit qui multa revelabit. And it is true
there is nothing concealed which shall not be discovered; for which cause a
marvellous being shall come after me, who as yet lives not, and who shall
reveal many things.

And I for one take it that the prophecy has now been fulfilled: Aleister
Crowley is the artist Elias, the marvellous being whom God has permitted to
make a discovery of the highest importance in his illuminative philosophy of
Crowleyanity, in the dazzling and flashing light of which there is nothing
concealed which shall not be discovered.

It has taken 100,000,000* years to produce Aleister Crowley. The world has
indeed laboured, and has at last brought forth a man. Bacon blames the
ancient and scholastic philosophers for spinning webs, like spiders out of
their own entrails; the reproach is perhaps unjust, but out of the web of these
spiders, Crowley has himself twisted a subtle cord, on which he has
suspended the universe, and swinging it round has sent the whole fickle
_____________________________________________________________________________________
world conception of these excogitating spiders into those realms which lie
behind Time and beyond Space. He stands on the virgin rock of Pyrrhonic-
Zoroastrianism, which unlike the Hindu world-conception, stands on neither
Elephant nor Tortoise, but on the Absolute Zero of the metaphysical
Qabalists.

*Vide Haeckel, "Last words on Evolution," p. 120.

The question now is, what is Crowleyanity or Pyrrhonic-Zoroastrianism?
and the answer is as follows:

"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the
Lord. Hosanna in the highest!" For this day*1. there has been born in Albion
a greater than David Hume, and a more illustrious than David Home,*2.
even had he been genuine.

*1. 12th October, 1875.
*2. D.D. Home, the Medium.

And he shall be called "Immanuel," that is "God with us," or being
interpreted Aleister Crowley, the spiritual son of Immanuel whose surname
was Cant!* And as the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ became known as
Christianity, so let this theurgy, as expounded by this marvellous being, be
known as Crowleyanity: or in other words, according to the mind of the
reader   ­    Pyrrhonic-Zoroastrianism,        Pyrrhonic-Mysticism, Sceptical-
Transcendentalism,     Sceptical-    Theurgy,     Sceptical-Energy, Scientific-
Illuminism, or what you will; for in short it is the conscious communion
with God on the part of an Atheist, a transcending of reason by scepticism of
the instrument, and the limitation of scepticism by direct consciousness of
the Absolute. To attain to such an illumination the mind of a Huxley and the
soul of a Loyola must be united in one person. And this illumination must be
as definite a phenomenon as orgasm, following which we find the material
world, and its foundation the world of thought, as honestly set down to
hallucination as a ghost would be. Construct the Temple in the place of the
Manger, on the site of the ruins of religion and philosophy, but with the
stones of the unfinished and abandoned Hall of Science. And in it let
Semiramis, heavy with child by the Holy Ghost, possess the couch of labour,
once crushed by the agonized form of Mary; and bring to light that
unmistakable phenomenon, by which no woman could doubt whether or no
she has ever been a mother, and in which no adept can doubt that he is one.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Vide Prolegomena. Bohn's ed., p. xxi.

Religion and Science have for many years seemingly run antagonistic to
each other, but in reality their antagonism has been of a superficial nature,
and fundamentally they at heart are one. The former having postulated an
eternal "creator," a something out of something ­ God; the latter postulated
an eternal "creation," a something for ever something ­ Matter.

              "The mere terrestrial-minded man
              Knows not the things of God, nor can
              Their subtle meaning understand?"
              A sage, I say, although he mentions
              Perhaps the best of his inventions,
              God.*

*Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 176.

Then under the daedal wand of Newton and Berkeley, Science disclosed the
fact that Matter is Hylo-Zoic ­ a fact already supposed by Spinoza ­ that is,
that within Matter itself lives an indwelling energy and power, and also that
matter as body solely exists in the automorphism of experience. Yet still do
the vapours of Animistic-Materialism cling round the forms of Newton and
Berkeley, and out of its blinding smoke issues the flame of Hylo-
Phenomenalism or Solipsimal-Automorphism; itself to blind in turn, and to
scorch the chill hands of the night which were being extended round its
welcome fire. The God-idea clinging to Philosophy, similarly as the
phlogiston-idea clung so long to the principles of chemistry. Now follows
the philosophic fall. Seeking the Absolute in sense-perceptions, and listening
to the chatter of the carnal snake, these wise men, these latter-day
philosophers, not finding eternal knowledge in the deific apple, ceased
munching so wry a pippin, declaring the God of Religion, the Matter of
Science, Unknowable, a thing in itself, like the jinnee in the vase, or
dispersed throughout Space as the jinnee when the vase was opened. Or else
again, like the present-day Rationalists, they have once more coaxed the
Almighty back into his leaden casket, and heaved him out again into the
black depths of that ocean of ignorance from which he had been drawn, a
bottled "succedaneum."
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thus Berkeley, by postulating a God, himself showed that reason was
wanting; so the scepticism of Pyrrho was once again applied to the defective
mental machinery, which burst like a faulty boiler on due pressure being
brought to bear upon it by David Hume. The final judgement of the senses
was doubted, but only partially, men sought the link which connected cause
and effect ­ the excluded middle-consciousness, and what may be called
super-consciousness; and to attain this end Crowley has applied the whole of
his Pyrrhonic-Iconoclasm to break down the vulgar Idealism of Theology, as
well as the vulgar Realism of the empirical Sciences.

             There's the true refuge of the wise;
             To overthrow the Temple guards,
             Deny reality.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 176.

In fact to crush and annihilate by means of a sceptical-theurgy the rational
fifth-Monarchism of the Scientific cults. Philosophy and Science have up to
the present apprehended things per nos, from this day forward they will,
under the atheistic theurgy of Crowleyanity, know things per se. The Ultima
Thule of our rigorous journey will at last be discernible on the horizon of our
minds, and the mixed drinks of the stumbling Scoto-German Bacchantes will
give way to the pure amrita of Iacchus.

The above may be symbolized as follows:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                               CROWLEYANITY

                                AGNOSTICISM

                               HYLO-IDEALISM


                IDEALISM            MYSTICISM REALISM


        THE   PYRRHONISTIC LINE        HYLO-IDEALISM

                                  AGNOSTICISM

                                CROWLEYANITY

In the centre is MYSTICISM which links together IDEALISM and REALISM, or the
Ego to the Non-Ego, and at the same time holds them apart. Without it Idealism becomes
Absolute Subjectivity, and Realism Absolute Objectivity. (N. B. The circle of Idealism is
the only entirely white circle in the symbol, and that of Realism the only entirely black
one. The "Jakin" and "Bohaz" of King Solomon's Temple.) Idealism and Realism are
further connected by the HYLO-IDEALlSTIC circle, which expresses them in terms of
science; and the whole is encircled by the ring of AGNOSTICISM, beyond which
philosophy as philosophy cannot penetrate. The three circles of Mysticism, Hylo-
Idealism (Idealism and Realism), and Agnosticism; or Magic, Science, and Philosophy,
are all bisected by the PYRRHONISTIC LINE of doubt which alone vanishes in the
circumference of CROWLEYANITY. This is the outer circle of all, forming, with the
Pyrrhonistic Line, a perfect YIN and YANG; itself the unutterable T A O.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
To attain to the ne plus ultra of Crowleyanity, it will be necessary to arrive
at a state of desperate despair, a state in which the equilibrium of both body
and mind are balancing between conscious alienation and unconscious
insanity; and this state is the Cerberus we all have to pass before we can
regain the blissful arms of our long-lost Eurydice. To clearly illuminate the
Orphic progress through the Plutonic regions of Philosophy, it will be
necessary, first of all to satisfy the three heads of the terrible offspring of
Echidna's womb, whose names are Berkeley, Hume, and Kant.


                                 BERKELEY

Berkeley, that "God-illumined Adept,"*1. almost at the commencement of
his introduction to "The Principles of Human Knowledge," states: "Upon the
whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of those
difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked up the
way to knowledge, are entirely owing to ourselves ­ that we have first raised
a dust, and then complained we cannot see."*2. And naturally to expect,
Berkeley himself, though an Adept of a very high order, starting upwards
through the clear atmosphere of the sky, clutched the very fire from the altar
of God, and then in his descent to the dusty plains of Earth, caused such a
whirlwind to arise, that his immediate successors, and even we who live two
hundred years after that storm arose, scarce dare open our eyes for fear of
being blinded.

*1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 225.
*2. P. 6.

A mystic by nature and a priest by profession, we must, in reviewing his
bequests to knowledge, always remember how much of the one side to
deduct from the other, should we wish to prove him either an Adept or a
Bishop. But with such inborn predilection, and such outward assumption, it
is easy to understand why it was that he threw the whole energy of his life
into an attempt to refute the advancing scepticism latent in the works of
Hobbes and Locke. He saw, and seeing fought the many children which had
sprung from the fertile womb of the Cartesian doctrine, of abstract general
ideas and secondary qualities; which alone found birth in the powers of
language, and in the delusion of words. But behind the didactic Berkeley
stands the mystic, that other Berkeley, whose knowledge has alone been
attained by a very few; for he spoke with God face to face.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"Could men but forbear to amuse themselves with words, we should, I
believe, soon come to an agreement in this point... that the absolute
existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning, or which
include a contradiction."*

*The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 43.

Berkeley, as has only too often been repeated and too frequently
misunderstood, did not deny the meaning of substance as taken in the vulgar
sense ­ a combination of sensible qualities, and though it may be possible,
he stated, "that solid, figured, movable substances may exist without the
mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible
for us to know this? Either we must know it by sense or by reason... But
what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the
mind, from what we perceive."*1. This point Crowley fully emphasizes in
"Time" when he writes: "a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us;
even its Unknowability is a species of knowledge of it: and, by Savitri! when
I say real to us, I say real absolutely, since all things lie to me in the radius
of my sensorium. `To others' is a vain phrase."*2. And as it has already been
shown in the chain A,B,A,B,A,B, it matters not if the Materialist chooses to
place his finger on A, or the Idealist on B; so in the above, Berkeley
annihilating the idea of a material substratum, at one and the same moment,
unwittingly immolates his own cherished child on that same blade with
which he has just sacrificed his foe. And, seeking to supplant the miserable
huts of the materialist, Berkeley similarly builds his gorgeous palaces on
reason, perceiving not that the foundations of both are the same, and that one
like the other will crumble into dust before the blinding storm of dialectic
dispute.

*1. The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 39.
*2. Time, vol. ii, p. 269.

Berkeley, in positing Esse=percipi, considered that he once and for all had
overthrown scepticism, which he defined as ­ the disbelief of the senses.*1.
In "The Principles of Human Knowledge," he states: "Our knowledge of
these (ideas) hath been very much obscured and confounded, and we have
been led into very dangerous errors, by supposing a twofold existence of the
objects of sense ­ the one intelligible or in the mind, the other real and
without the mind; whereby unthinking*2. things are thought to have a
_____________________________________________________________________________________
natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits.
This... is the very root of Scepticism... For how can it be known that the
things which are perceived are conformable to those which are not
perceived, or exist without the mind."*3. Shortly before arriving at this
conclusion, he had already stated that as "the infinite divisibility of matter"
was now universally allowed by the most approved and considerable
philosophers, hence it follows that there are an infinite number of parts in
each particle of matter which are not perceived by sense. "...In proportion,
therefore, as the sense is rendered more acute, it perceives a greater number
of parts in the object, that is, the object appears greater, and its figure
varies."*4. In other words the Self of the Idealist as the Not-self of the
Materialist, is purely maya, i.e., motion. But a still more important
contradiction creeps in here, and curious to say, the very monster Berkeley
set out with lance in rest to overthrow, proves but a Quixotic windmill which
sends our gallant knight rolling in the very dust in which he had hoped to lay
low the sceptical and monstrous giant. Thus in the place of disproving
scepticism he unconsciously cleared the way for the greatest of all sceptics ­
David Hume.

*1. Time, vol. ii, p. 51.
*2. Berkeley, throughout "The Principles," as well as the "Dialogues," overlooks the
Newtonian law of gravity altogether, though he supposes that he himself is not the only
thinking entity in the world, his arguments lead one to infer that he is. As an Idealist he
proves that nothing can exist except in mind; then finding he has overlooked the question
of God, as an Animist adds: that all things, he himself included, cannot exist except in the
mind of some Divine Being, failing (perhaps purposely) to see that such a Being was also
but a figment of his mind.
*3. Ibid. p. 79.
*4. Ibid. p. 55.



                                         HUME

Hume, at heart a thoroughgoing agnostic and man of the world, saw the
practical falsity of abstruse philosophy, the conclusions of which were at
once dissipated by the "feelings of our heart," which reduced "the profound
philosopher to a mere plebeian." He forcibly asserts, that ideas of primary
qualities are attained by abstraction ­ "an opinion which if we examine it
accurately, we shall find to be unintelligible, and even absurd." He further
agrees with Berkeley in stating that: "An extension that is neither tangible
nor visible, cannot possibly be conceived," and that, "The mind has never
_____________________________________________________________________________________
anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any
experience of their connexion with objects."*1. And again that the
"...universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the
slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to
the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inlets
through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce
any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object."*2. However,
the great unknown waste of this "immediate intercourse" Hume bravely sets
out to explore.

*1. An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p.163.
*2. Ibid. p. 161.

As Berkeley had previously got hopelessly bogged in the swamps of God, so
Hume, avoiding the shore line, set out on the same quest by way of the
desert of Scepticism, without the chart of so divine a knowledge, but with
the compass of a more certain direction; nevertheless, soon losing his way in
the arid wilderness of doubt, he also left the great riddle unanswered, to leap
voiceless midst the desert wind, and to dance songless `mongst his bleached
and rattling bones. Further on we shall see how Crowley, setting out with
both chart and compass, like a second OEdipus wrested the secret from the
age-worn lips of the Sphinx; for as he himself says:

                        Eternal mockery is the real;
                        Eternal falsehood, the ideal.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 93.

However, Hume arrives at a negative result of extraordinary worth. He took
Newton's second law of motion,* i.e., of Cause and Effect, and wrote
against it a colossal "WHY?"

*Every change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and is made in the
direction of that force.

Berkeley, as we saw above, arrived at the conclusion, that it was impossible
to solve the question of relationship between the things which are perceived,
and the things which are not perceived; and in the "Three Dialogues between
Hylas and Philonous" he further elaborates this proposition. Hume by a
slightly different road arrives at an exactly similar conclusion, namely: how
_____________________________________________________________________________________
is it possible to judge the relationship between cause and effect, or in other
words the perceived and not perceived?

"The first time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse...
(billiard balls)... what alteration has happened to give rise to this new idea
of connexion? Nothing but that he now feels these events to be connected in
his imagination..."*

*An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, p. 78.

Hume thus arrives at the conclusion that cause and effect can only be
inferred from each other, and never known. "Beyond the constant
conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to the
other, we have no notion of any necessity or connexion."*

*An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 85.

"Their (bodies) secret nature, and consequently all their effects and
influence, may change, without any change in their sensible qualities. This
happens sometimes, and with regard to some objects: Why may it happen
always, and with regard to all objects? What logic, what process of argument
secures you against this supposition? My practice, you say, refutes my
doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question. As an agent, I am quite
satisfied in the point; but as a philosopher, who has some show of curiosity,
I will not say scepticism, I want to learn the foundation of this inference. No
reading, no inquiry has as yet been able to remove my difficulty, or give me
satisfaction in a matter of such importance. Can I do better than propose the
difficulty to the public, even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of
obtaining a solution? We shall, at least, by these means, be sensible of our
ignorance, if we do not augment our knowledge.

"I must confess that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance who
concludes, because an argument has escaped his own investigation, that
therefore it does not really exist."*1. And he continues further on: "And
though he should be convinced that his understanding has no part in the
operation, he would nevertheless continue in the same course of thinking.
There is some other principle which determines him to form such a
conclusion."*2.

*1. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, pp. 37-38.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*2. Ibid. p. 43.

"We must, therefore, know both the cause and effect, and the relation
between them. But do we pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the
human soul and the nature of an idea, or the aptitude of one to produce the
other? This is a real creation, a production of something out of nothing...
such a power is not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the mind..."*

*An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 69.

We are now fairly on our road to Crowleyanity. Having left Berkeley in the
dark, feeling on the dusty shelves of his reason for a flint and steel in the
spirituality of God, whereby he may burn in twain the gordian knot into
which he has tangled his understanding; we now find Hume, in a similar
manner, groping for the handle of some bricked-up door, which will lead
him forth from the depths of that same night in which Berkeley has already
lost his way.

When Hume states: "he feels events to be connected in his imagination"; he
is only reiterating the words of Philonous, when he says: "I have a notion of
Spirit, though I have not, strictly speaking, an idea of it. I do not perceive it
as an idea, or by means of an idea, but know it by reflexion." To which
Hylas very properly replied: "Words are not to be used without a meaning.
And, as there is no more meaning in spiritual Substance than in material
Substance, the one is to be exploded as well as the other." Philonous, in
answering Hylas then asserts acquaintance with that nature of the human
soul which Hume declared to be inconceivable. "How often must I repeat,
that I know or am conscious of my own being; and that I myself am not my
ideas, but somewhat else, a thinking active principle, that perceives, knows,
wills, and operates about ideas."*

*Three Dialogues, p. 95.

This "human soul" of Hume, the "I myself" of Berkeley are synonymous
terms; in fact, they are one with the "purusha" of the Yogins, and the
"magical stone" of the philosophic alchymists. Hume arrives at the
conclusion: "that there is a species of scepticism, antecedent to all study and
philosophy, which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others, as a
sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgement. It
recommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and
_____________________________________________________________________________________
principles, but also of our very faculties, of whose veracity, say they, we
must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deducted from some original
principle which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is
there any such original principle which has a prerogative above others that
are self-evident and convincing; or if there were, could we advance a step
beyond it, by the use of those very faculties, of which we are sup-posed to be
already diffident. The Cartesian doubt, therefore, were it ever possible to be
attained by any human creature (as it plainly is not), would be entirely
incurable, and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance and
conviction upon any subject."*1. And that, "a wise man, therefore,
proportions his belief to his evidence,"*2. and who can say that a wise adept
does not do likewise? And that "These ultimate springs and principles are
totally shut up from human curiosity and inquiry" and "are probably the
ultimate causes and principles which we ever discover in nature." I On this
despairing position of Hume, Kant bases his à priori.*3.

*1. Three Dialogues, p. 159.
*2. Ibid. p. 116.
*3. Ibid. p. 29.



                            BERKELEY AND HUME

Thus Hume arrives at the conclusion that all relationships between cause and
effect are based on experience, and behind experience there is, "a certain
unknown and inexplicable something."*1. So also does Berkeley in the
"Three Dialogues" end in a similar quandary which he calls "God." Starting
out on his quest by stating: "Can any doctrine be true that, necessarily leads
a man into an absurdity?"*2. he promptly proceeds to travel along that road
which he has warned others not to follow, and, having completely lost his
way, and overloaded his thoughts with the darkness of night, finding it
impossible to continue his journey, knocks at the creaky door of a miserable
tavern, and regaling himself on the common wine of that strange country in
which he has wandered, proclaims the hour of noon as the clock strikes
midnight.

"I conclude," states Philonous, "not that they [sensible things] have no real
existence, but that, seeing they depend not on my thought, and have an
existence distinct from being perceived by me, there must be some other
mind wherein they exist. As sure, therefore, as the sensible world really
exists, so sure is there an infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and
supports it."* Midnight is striking, and we once again begin the eternal (and
infernal) chain A,B,A,B,A,B.

                                    KANT

On Hume's despairing "something," Kant builds his à priori, and though the
detail of his criticism differs from that of Hume's, in the main result it
coincides, arriving at the same unleapable ditch, the limitation of all
knowledge regarding the reality of phenomena as revealed to us by our
senses. Hume starting with the proposition that ideas are copied from
impressions ends in the unknown; Berkeley through a similar process
declares bankruptcy in God: Kant does likewise, stating in his "Critic of pure
Reason"; "All knowledge (touching an object of mere reason) can be
communicated not logically but morally... I am morally certain... etc." But
what he means by the word "morally" he does not explain, postulating in
place of an explanation an "à priori certainty." To Hume's scepticism he
answers: the object is unknowable per se, the subject is also unknowable per
se, because they both vary, consequently ontology is impossible. But the
laws and forms of thoughts are universal and irrefragable, and form an
unalterable standard of certainty whereby knowledge may be increased. À
priori laws are not derived from experience, but belong to the inherent
structure of the mind. Kant then sets himself to answer the question: How
are synthetic judgements à priori possible? And his answer is: Unless
cognitions are synthetical they can add nothing to our previous knowledge,
unless à priori they cannot be universal. Unless universal they cannot be
apodictically true. Kant's reasoning runs as follows: Firstly, there is a
sensibility, a power of being affected by objects, a passive faculty; secondly,
an understanding, a faculty recognizing the affectations of the sensibility,
this is active, and responds to stimulation. The sensibility, however, has its
laws, and to discover them, we must separate those which are multiple from
those which are one. The objects are variable, the passive functions of the
mind remain invariable, the multiple he calls the material, the invariable he
christens form ­ Space and Time.

Space and Time are therefore the indispensable conditions of all sensation,
and according to Kant are not deducible from experience, consequently they
are à priori. The understanding, similarly as the sensibility, possesses certain
forms called judgements, of which there are four classes: "quantity, quality,
relation, and modality." These are the à priori categories of the
understanding, and they are synthetic.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
This à priori (Crowleyanity affirms) is no innate intuition at all, in fact
merely an abstraction from experience, and an equivalence of statement. It
may be a postulation of our egoity, but it therefore need not necessarily be so
for all other personalities, as it cannot be in any way demonstrated as final.
Kant did not have the necessary knowledge of taking into consideration the
fact of inherited experiences, as Herbert Spencer was able to do, so worked
at a disadvantage, postulating an à priori in place of organised intuitions.


              CROWLEYANITY AND THE PROLEGOMENA

To illustrate the infolding of Crowleyanity, it will be necessary here to run
through Kant's Prolegomena, reducing his arguments to the terms of this all
embracing philosophy. (To aid the reader, I will place all criticisms of a
purely Crowleyan savour in square brackets.*)

*These are the words of Crowley, the student.

Immanuel Kant finding his master David Hume enmeshed in the negative
net of an excessive Pyrrhonism, set out to free him from the tangled
conception of cause. To accomplish this end, and to avoid falling into the
same entanglement of empirical uncertainties (physical), groping about in
the dark for some weapon which might enable him to free his unfortunate
master, himself fell into the same metaphysical pitfall, and contented himself
by declaring his strangling senior as "free." In other words: "It (the source of
metaphysical knowledge) consists, then, in knowledge à priori, that is,
knowledge derived from pure understanding, pure reason" (p. 11).* [Then it
is impossible and its extension zero; for the intension of reason and its forms
are alike built up by experience, that of the race (H. Spencer).]

*Bohn's edition of the Prolegomena.

Having postulated metaphysical knowledge, Kant then proceeds to subdivide
it into two headings: 1, Analytic; 2, Synthetic judgements; the first Crowley
would identify with [verbal propositions], the second with [real]. First Kant
states: "All analytic judgements are based entirely on the principles of
contradiction... and are... à priori" (p. 13), e.g., "Every body is extended,"
... "Nobody is unextended," e.g., "Gold is a yellow metal."
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"Now, to know this, I require no further experience beyond my conception
of gold, which contains the proposition that this body is yellow and a metal"
(p. 13). [But, answers Crowley, what of the proposition "Gold is a trivalent
base? None of these things are analytic. Thus gold must be reducible to the
noumenon, and so disappear.]

In the second proposition Kant says: That though there are synthetic
judgements à posteriori, "there are also others of an à priori certainty,"
which "can never have their source solely... in the principle of
contradiction" (p. 13). "Judgements of experience are always synthetic. It
would be absurd to found an analytic judgement on experience" (p. 14).
[Crowley at once answers, "All judgements are founded on experience. This
primary fallacy of à priori validity is clearly the root of the great follies
which follow. 1+1=2 cannot be doubted, but it is a definition, and means
nothing, being arbitrary. But 2+2=4 is a synthetic conception.]

Similarly under this synthetic heading, Kant tackles "Mathematical
judgements, illustrating his conception of straight which has no reference to
size, but only to quality, by defining "a straight line is the shortest between
two points" [which is certainly untrue*: "Two straight lines cannot enclose a
space," is better; for in the definition which he gives, Kant does not seem to
have grasped the true conception of "straight."] Hume, Kant states, severed
pure mathematics from synthetic judgements à priori, and herein made a
great mistake, as all mathematical judgements he asserts are synthetic. [But
is his dogmatism correct? Crowley would disagree.]

*What relation is there between our conceptions of rectitude and length? None, till
geometry informs us.

[(a.) Mathematics is analytic, because a parabola is but a name, and all its
qualities are directly deducible from its definitions, etc., etc., and therefore
contained therein, though not seen. (b.) Mathematics is based on racial
experience, and even on individual learning; only a few highly developed
brains can apprehend its propositions. It may be doubted whether any
synthetic judgement exists at all; for the moment it is made it becomes
analytic. This is obvious of "A" and "E" propositions, and only not so of "I"
and "O," because the subject is impure.]

Kant then rejecting metaphysics as a true science (p. 21), asserts, however
with confidence, "that certain pure synthetic cognitions are really given à
_____________________________________________________________________________________
priori, namely; pure mathematics and pure natural science... both... partly
apodictically certain through mere Reason." [However he fails to quote any
such proposition! And his "apodictic certainty" only means that the human
mind is unable to transcend that limitation. Thus metaphysics is a mere
branch of psychology, for one thing; for another, every result obtained is
merely a statement of limitation, and therefore every accession of knowledge
is a vision of a new vista of ignorance. Summa scientia nihil scire, has yet
another meaning.]

Having then as he thought discovered an à priori basis to metaphysics, he
places before his reader the crucial problem. "How are synthetic
propositions à priori possible"? And at the very outset, assuming pure
synthetic knowledge from the Reason as real (p. 22), attacks the problem.
"How is it possible when a conception is given me, I can pass out of it, and
connect it with another which is not contained in the former," and explains
the difficulty by assumed knowledge à priori, [Rendering Hume's position
now impregnable, thanks to ethnology, etc., etc.]; and then Kant asks, "How
is pure mathematics possible"? [Again falling into the fallacy of supposing
his own brain to be without a history, It is curious to note that Kant's à
priori is but a recasting of the old myth of Pallas, Wisdom, springing full-
armed from the brain of Zeus, and like the legend is a strangely false
assertion.] Thus, into the trap Kant sets out to rescue Hume from, he himself
falls, by asserting that: "it is only by means of the form of sensuous intuition
that we can intuite things à priori, but in this way we intuite the objects only
as they appear to our senses, not as they may be in themselves (p. 29). [Thus
Kant himself proves the noumenon, the sole refuge from scepticism, itself to
be sceptical.] Kant must have in some way felt the weakness of his
argument, since in the following page, he, in true Berkeleyan fashion, in
order to upset the sceptic, argues in a circle; and to prove the possibility of à
priori judgements, insists on the sceptic proving an à priori proposition.
Having thoroughly entangled the sceptic, as he thinks, he launches out an
"apodictic certainty," very similar to Berkeley's "God-idea," and defines
"Idealism" to "consist in the assertion that there exist none but thinking
entities." [Crowley at once denies the "certainty," and demands an
explanation of "thinking."] Then working through the Berkeleyan arguments
backwards, he arrives at defining. [Thing as a (unknowable) power to
produce sense impressions, which is purely Berkeley or his antithesis
according as the power is conceived as God or Matter.] Here we have struck
again the fundamental chain A,B,A,B,A,B.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Having now settled with "Pure Mathematics," he turns to "Pure Natural
Science," again assuming at the outset apodictic laws of nature, which
Berkeley also assumed, and which Hume proved to be sceptical; such as
"substance continues permanent" ­ a theory on the same footing as papal
infallibility, and about a hundred years older ­ and that all that happens is
"determined by a cause according to fixed laws" (p. 42). Concerning which
Huxley states: "not one of these events is `more than probable'; though the
probability may reach such a very high degree that, in ordinary language, we
are justified in saying that the opposite events are impossible."*

*Essay on Hume, p. 155.

This is even going a step in advance of Hume, who stated: "a miracle is a
violation of the laws of nature."* As to the conservation of energy and
matter, Crowley would say: ["they were arguments in a circle (A); for the
use of scientific instruments by which they were discovered, implies these
laws."] Kant would not say (A) but "à priori truth"; and as to the laws of
cause and effect, [if we accept causality, etc., then we must regard all as
truly parts of one thing, perhaps even as aspects of one thing.] And Kant,
after a series of analytical arguments, comes to the conclusion that the
legitimacy of natural laws "rests on the necessary connection of phenomena
in an experience, in other words, on the original laws of the understanding,"
(p. 67). The understanding drawing its laws à priori not from nature, but
prescribing them to it. [But these original laws of the (Kantian)
understanding are themselves the result of the empirical laws of nature, and
of an inherited wealth of experience; "Omnia exeunt in O." And it is
certainly not far from this to the Ego positing the non-Ego.]

*An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, p. 120.

At length, thoroughly entrapped in his own metaphysics, caught by that very
same net wherewithal he set out to drag the infinite depths of eternity; he
defines the noumenon as the final term of an infinite series, and asserts that
the permanence of the soul can only be proved in the life of man, "the proof
of which will not be required by us." Then standing aghast as the
phantasmagoria of his mind crowd past him; states in the plainest words, that
the Reason itself is at fault, and casting it into the balance of Pyrrho, weighs
it out in due terms of Crowleyanity.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The following are the four transcendent ideas, or four dialectical assertions
of the pure Reason. To each accordingly is opposed a contradictory
assumption (p. 87).


                      Thesis                            Antithesis
  1    The world has a beginning            The world is infinite in time and
       (boundary) in time and space.        space.
  2    Everything in the world consists     There is nothing simple, but
       of simple (parts).                   everything is composite.
  3    There are in the world causes        There is no freedom, but all is
       through freedom.                     Nature.
       In the series of the world causes    There is nothing necessary but in
  4    there exists a necessary being.      this series all is contingent.



"The above is the most remarkable phenomenon of the human Reason, of
which no instance can be shown in any other sphere. If, as generally
happens, we regard the phenomena of the world of sense as things in
themselves; if we assume the principles of their connection as universal of
things in themselves, and not merely as principles valid of experience, as is
usual and indeed unavoidable without our Critique; then an unexpected
conflict arises, never to be quelled in the ordinary dogmatic way, because
both theses and antitheses can be demonstrated by equally evident, clear and
irresistible proofs... and the Reason thus sees itself at issue with itself, a
state over which the sceptic rejoices, but which must plunge the critical
philosopher into reflection and disquiet." [Thus another turning in the road
of Crowleyanity has been passed, another milestone has been lost in the
distance, a new vista is opening to us, and once again we gaze on the
delusive mirage of the Reason, the mere Zill U'llah ­ The Shadow of God.]

"...Seeing it is quite impossible to get free of this conflict of the Reason
with itself, so long as the objects of the sense-world are taken for things in
themselves, and not for what they are in reality, namely, mere phenomena,
the reader is necessitated thereby again to undertake the deduction of all our
knowledge à priori" (p. 96). [And since the noumenon can possess no
predicate ­ what is it then that it does possess? It is the Reason itself which
is at fault; the delicate time-piece of Kant's intellect has gone wrong, it has
ceased to "tick," and with the terrific blow of an à priori club, he proclaims
_____________________________________________________________________________________
it mended, and regulates each chiming clock in the house of many mansions
by means of its handless face.] Thus has the great lion of Crowleyanity set
the little crab of Konigsberg and his lunar hut in their appointed niche in the
great solar mansion of eternity.

At length we have arrived at the end of our first series of arguments, which
may be generalized as the infoldment of all rational philosophies into one
uncertain philosophic problem. Berkeley, as we have seen, opened the
gateway of scepticism, and was the first to vanish in the Absolute ether of
Pyrrhonism, which he outwardly symbolized under the form of a Bishop of
the Church of England. Hume following, clutched vaguely in the night of
doubt at a "something" he could not grasp, and whose watery substance
trickled through his clenched and searching fingers. Kant similarly losing his
way in the night of Hume's ignorance, struck a spark on the tail of his shirt,
proclaiming the day; but as the flames rose and scorched his fundamental
basis, he, also, leapt from his empiric hose into the cool comfort of that
watery ocean Hume had attempted to shadow in the palm of his hand. Then
behind these three gallant knights clattered along their no less gallant
esquires: Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and in the distance, lost in the dust of
Reason, stand the present-day yokels of thought, thinking at appointed hours
according to appointed books.


                    FICHTE, SCHELLING, AND HEGEL

Close on the heels of Kant came Fichte with his unknowable appulse as the
only potency of the not-self, which assuaged the raging thirst of inquiry as
would a bottle of wine long since dry. Behind him Schelling, who leaping
into the clouds, grasped at object and subject as existing actualities, calling
the bastard children of his brain manifestations of the Absolute. Then Hegel
who, instead of sitting out on the universal stairs with Berkeley's "Bishop,"
waltzed wildly with some ethereal Absolute, which, whether object or
subject, was in no case existence, merely the skeleton of some phantom
appearance, having no life in itself, but solely in the absolute mirror of its
reflection. Each of these Titans, in his own manner, threw fresh fuel on to
the Berkeleyan conflagration, so hoping that, by piling up the blazing mass,
they might illumine the entire universe. And how they failed the last five
decades have only too directly shown, by their stagnation in the realms of a
certain and unknowable Absolute; and in the parasitic growths of Scientific
Agnosticism, Scientific Positivism, Scientific Monism, and the general
_____________________________________________________________________________________
overwhelming materialization of present-day thought. Yet the self per se
remains just as unknowable in a positive degree, as it would have, had all the
ages forever held their peace. Nevertheless the arguments which they set
forth, ideal or material, have in their frantic efforts to support it, forced the
whole gigantic structure to the ground. From these ruins of experience
Crowley now rises up a fiery phoenix, directing us to the only possible way
which will lead us to our much-desired haven of rest.

Motion must cease, irritation must be prevented, Time and Space
annihilated, and the divine "I" set free from the sordid rags of the world, to
be clothed in the brilliancy of God.* This added "impulse," which in the
homogeneous protoplasm causes fission, is as mystical to-day as that added
"something" which will cause the mind of one man to admire a Wagnerian
opera, and another a drawing by Beardsley. No sound is in the air, vibrations
only pass. No sound is in the brain, molecular changes only result. Where
then is sound? It is a creation in the mind by the divine "I"; that unextended
absolute Passivity, whose dwelling is in that equilibrating activity which
balances action and reaction.

*It should never for a moment be forgotten that any attempt to construct a positive
philosophic system from these data would be strenuously repudiated by Crowley. The
danger constantly recurs, because in the normal (educated) man the reason is master. Like
the hydra of Hercules, its heads grow again; they must be branded by the torch of
illuminism, as well as smitten off by the sword of scepticism.

Hegel (outside the realms of the divine philosophers) was one of the very
few who partially grasped the supreme truth of Crowleyanity, when he
postulated: "Being and Non-Being are the same." He saw that pure being is,
in its last analysis, beyond fertilization, development, or motion, and is
practical nothingness.

"The fertilization of Being, according to Hegel, arose by the passing over, as
it were, of Being into its antitheses, otherness, or complement ­ that is, into
Non-Being. But this antithesis, otherness, complement, was in a real sense
Being itself, for Being and Non-Being, being equally nothingness, are in the
same category. Herein, however, were motion, interaction, stimulus, and no
response to stimulus rendered, not only a possibility, but a reality; and Pure
Being, thus enriched or fertilized by the double interaction, became
manifested as existence ­ that is, conditioned Being. Pure Being, the
Unconditioned, the Absolute of Potentiality rolled round into pure Non-
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Being, the Unconditioned; the Absolute of Impotentiality, emerged,
energized, and conditioned, and became the Limited, the Relative. This is
the groundwork of the Hegelian philosophy."*

*Absolute Relativism, p. 114.

Yet once again that added impulse arises in the passing over. What is it?
Crowleyanity does not, in words, explain; for being beyond reason, it is both
inexplicable and undefinable in rational terms; yet it directs, and the weary
traveller, searching for the stone of the wise, has but to follow, guided by the
sure and certain hope that if he so will, it will guide him to that great and
glorious transfiguration he so ardently desires.


                                     TIME

Kant, as we have seen, places both Time and Space in the realm of the à
priori; a realm utterly devastated by Crowley's scepticism. Spencer in
answering the questions, What is Space? What is Time? replied, "Space is
the abstract of all relations of co-existence. Time is the abstract of all
relations of sequence." These definitions have been found wanting, chiefly
on account of the doubtful connotation of the word abstract, but with
McTaggart's emendation read:

       Space is the synthesis of all experiences of co-existence.
       Time is the synthesis of all experiences of sequence.*

*Absolute Relativism, p. 14.

So we find that taking the above as general definitions, they may with equal
accuracy be applied to either the Ego or the race; in the former case, Space
and Time vanishing with the extinction of the individual; in the latter with
that of the race. So also if space be defined as "the potentiality of all co-
existences," then in the destruction of all existences Space will also cease to
be. But if Space be defined "as that eternal actuality wherein all other things
or no things may co-exist, then, even on the destruction of all things, Space
would still remain."* Yet this definition is extremely faulty, as Time re-
mains to be considered; which we shall now deal with.

*Absolute Relativism, p. 15.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
In Crowley's essay bearing the name of "Time" the matter is set forth in a
dialogue between a British sceptic and an Indian mystic. In it, by a rather
different route, he comes to a somewhat similar conclusion to that taught by
Eckhart in Germany at the beginning of the fourteenth century. "That the
creature apart from the Absolute, that is, God, was nothing, that `Time,
Space, and the plurality which depends on them,' are also nothing in
themselves, and that the duty of man as a moral being is to rise beyond this
nothingness of the creature, and by direct intuition to place himself in
immediate union with the Absolute."*1. The two disputants, Scepticus and
Mysticus, set out by agreeing that the unknowable is unreal, and as the latter
says with Berkeley, "a thing is only real to us so far as it is known by us."*2.

*1. The Real History of the Rosicrucians, A. E. Waite.
*2. Time, vol. ii, p. 269.

When Scepticus asks Mysticus, "How old are you?" and receives the
answer, "I am but an ultimate truth, six world-truths, fourteen grand
generalizations, eighty generalizations, sixty-two dilemmas, and the usual
odd million impressions,"*1. he is receiving a much more correct and
scientific answer to his question than if Mysticus, like Mahatma Agamya,
answered, "sixty-two." Mysticus then turning to Scepticus asks him the
seemingly simple question, "What is a `year'?"*2. Scepticus answers
something about the earth moving round the sun, and is at once shown by
Mysticus that a man stating a fact in reference to "Since the Derby was run,"
would be more intelligible than he who would say, "Since May, such and
such a day"; "...for his memory is of the race, and not of a particular item in
the ever changing space-relation of the heavens, a relation which he can
never know, and of which he can never perceive the significance; nay, which
he can never recognize, even by landmarks of catastrophic importance."*3.
Scepticus at once grasps the absurdity of such a situation by picturing the
cross-examination of a farm-hand by a lawyer:

*1. Time, vol. ii, p. 269.
*2. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 270.
*3. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 272.

"Now, Mr. Noakes, I must warn you to be very careful. Had Herschell
occulted  Centauri before you left Farmer Stubbs' field'? while the
instructed swain should not blush to reply that Halley's Comet, being the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
sole measure of time in use on his farm was 133° S., entering Capricorn, at
the very moment of the blow being struck."*1. Scepticus goes on to state
that H. G. Wells has put his finger on the very spot whence all research must
begin: and that is, "the illusionary nature of the time-idea."*2. "You would
say that of two men born on a day, dying on a day, one may be young, the
other old... he lives the longest who remembers most."*3. Mysticus
considers the definition insufficient unless the "vividness of each
impression" is added to the "number of impressions." Scepticus then shows
that it would be possible in thought to construct a scale of vividness from a
to n, by which we could erect a formula to express all that a man is. "For
example, he might be: 10 a+33125 b+890 c+800112 658 e+992
f+...+...+...n, and, if we can find the ratio of a:b:c:d:e:f...:n, we can resolve
the equation into a single term, and compare man and man."*4.

*1. Time, vol. ii, p. 273.
*2. Ibid.
*3. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 273-274.
*4. Ibid. vol. ii, p. 274.

It therefore follows that "all states of consciousness are single units, or time
marks, by which we measure intervals." So that Time is wholly and solely
founded on experience, or response to stimulus; and in no way on any à
priori judgement as postulated by Kant.

Berkeley has shown us that it is impossible to form an abstract idea of
motion distinct from the body moving,*1. also that "motion being only an
idea, it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not;"*2. and in the "Three
Dialogues" he again maintains this indisputable fact:

*1. Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 11.
*2. Ibid. p. 62.

                 Phil. And is not time measured by the succession of ideas in our
       mind?
                 Hyl. It is.
                 Phil. And is it not possible ideas should succeed one another
       twice as fast in your mind as they do in mine, or in that of some spirit
       of another kind?
                 Hyl. I own it.*

*The Dialogues, p. 35.

This clinches the whole argument between Mysticus and Scepticus, as it did
between the two disputants Philonous and Hylas.


                               THE QABALAH

Before entering upon Aleister Crowley's ontological essay on Space, it will
be as well first to run through, briefly though it may be, some of the more
important eclaircissements of the Qabalah, and the influence this divine
theurgy has alike borne on his poetry and philosophy; for his analysis of
space is based on the ontological assertion of the absoluteness of the
Qabalistic Zero.

Worshippers of a personal God are by nature ultra-materialistic. Their God
is but a friend, a mighty man who will eventually pull them out of the
present bog of existence; being too lazy to do so themselves, they invest him
with special powers; once fashioned, the next step was to endow him with an
immortalizing energy, and then, curious to say, they discovered he had given
them, as a slight reward, an immortal soul for all the trouble they had taken
in turning him out a really nice, amiable, and respectable Deity. Having
magnified their friend into a God, they then proceeded to enlarge their
enemy into a Devil. This gross materialism in accordance with the universal
law of polarity, set in motion by the hand of Idealism, produced as effect a
fanciful spiritualism, which sought in the mysteries of life an answer that lay
still on the cold lips of Death. These two powers, the Pantheonic materialism
and the Gnostic spiritualism, bore the hybrid ­ Christianity.

As all religions have finally become subservient to an interested priesthood,
so have all religions (however spiritual they may have been in their youth)
been materialized and sacrificed on the altar of gain. To this rule Christianity
forms no exception; once crudely and sincerely spiritual, it has become
deceitfully materialistic.

God, who was formerly an Almighty Pleroma, is now but the moke which
carries the priest's eggs to market; and Christ, the Saviour and Redeemer,
the stick with which the wretched old jennet is beaten along. Christianity is
no longer what its name implies, the system of doctrines as taught by Christ,
but diametrically the reverse, the system of desires as wrought by Man. It is
no longer "Sell all," but "Seize all"; or "Give all," but "Get all." Mammon is
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the God of to-day, and modern Christianity is absolute and unadulterated
materialism. As such it is not necessary to look far for its antithesis.
Religions decay through materiality, and whenever religions decay
mysticism arises; for materiality cannot explain existence, neither can it
quench the thirst of man. Since Christianity has suffered from senile decay,
what have we found? A new religion? No. An old religion? Yes.
Rejuvenated? Yes. Man is too lazy to build if he can reconstruct. The great
mass of the people yearn for something better than the existing conceptions
of Faith; leaderless, disunited, they fall an easy prey to the charlatans who
ever keep their finger on the social pulse, and are ever as willing to pose,
when opportunity is offered, as seer, clairvoyant, or palmist, as they are as
trickster, tout, or quack. And the result? A vast drift of earnest aspirations
seething in an ocean of ignorance. The great thoughts of old prostituted to
the gains and stupidity of modernity, a great libel foisted on the past to
satisfy the credulity of the present; a systematized thieving from the statue of
Isis to adorn the idol of Mammon, god of bankers, brigands, and beggars.
Astrology gave us astronomy, and Alchemy gave us chemistry, both were
antagonistic to the ideas of their day; let us hope that Psychical Research
will give us a purer metaphysics.

Now the question before us here, is: how does all this decaying and growing
of ideals affect the poetic philosophy of Aleister Crowley? And the answer
is as follows:

To the writer of this essay it seems on reading Aleister Crowley's poems that
the revolt against existing ideals and morals is more the outcome of
spontaneous intuition than of meditative scepticism: and so strong is the
current, and so diverse and intricate are its eddies, that for one who is not an
adept, it seems almost a forlorn hope to plunge into the boiling cataract of
his ontologic philosophy, with any expectation of reaching the further bank
in safety. It would perhaps seem safer to forego such an attempt altogether,
but so alloyed have these mystical ideas become with the general structure
of his philosophy, that such a course is rendered impossible, so that the
failure of safety would be only more ignominious than the failure of attempt.

Aleister Crowley as we have seen is no Christian, neither is he a gullible
spiritualist, nor a gross materialist. Seeking an answer to the mystery, he first
finds it in the ontology of the Qabalah, and then finally through Mysticism
and Agnosticism, to their reconciliation in a neo-Hermeticism, a neo-
Rosicrucianism ­ which we have already called Crowleyanity.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Not only has Crowley succeeded in finding all the scattered pieces of Osiris which Isis
discovered, but also his phallus which she could not find.

Yet though he does not end at that barrier beyond which the Rationalist
cannot proceed, he by no means rejects common sense and understanding as
his Epode on Nature clearly shows.

              Nature my name is called. O fruitless veil
                       Of the strange self of its own self begotten!
              O vision laughterless! O shadowy tale!
              .     .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .     .  .  .   .
              I am Nature and God: I reign, I am, alone.
                       None other may abide apart: they perish,
              Drawn into me, into my being grown.
                       None other bosom is, to bear, to nourish,
              To be: the heart of all beneath my zone
                       Of blue and gold is scarlet-bright to cherish
              My own's life being, that is, and is not other;
              For I am God and Nature and thy Mother.
              .     .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .     .  .  .   .
              I am: the greatest and the least: the sole
                       And separate life of things. The mighty stresses
              Of worlds are my nerves twitching. Branch and bole
                       Of forests waving in deep wildernesses
              Are hairs upon my body. Rivers roll
                       To make one tear in my superb caresses,
              When on myself myself begets a child,
              A system of a thousand planets piled!
              .     .   .    .   .   .   .   .   .     .  .  .   .
                                            ...I wheel in wingless flight
                       Through lampless space, the starless wildernesses!
              Beyond the universal bounds that roll,
              There is the shrine and image of my soul.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, pp. 156, 157.

Many of the believers in the Qabalah, as those in the Vedas, will give an
almost endless antiquity to the ideas contained in their books. In one degree
_____________________________________________________________________________________
at least they are right, for the mysticism as contained in these systems of
thought is as old as thought itself.

The great system of the Qabalah is one of emanation ­ a type of spiritual
monism, an attempted explanation of the nature of the Deity, within the
limitations of mind. Its correspondence with the Talmud is more of method
than material. That it was of slow growth is very certain, that it is a
conglomerated mass of a multitude of efforts is also most sure. The Zohar is
its corner-stone, and the date of its construction extends probably from the
second to the seventh century of the present era. Much of its logic,
psychology, metaphysics, philosophy, and theology, is drawn directly from
the Midrash. To make it superior to profane literature its simplicity has at
various times been cloaked in a truculent obscurantism, many of its students
delighting in paraphrases and hermeneutical constructions. Because of their
unintelligibility words were transposed, numericalisms added, till at last
much if not all its sense was lost in a maze of mental legerdemain, and in
such exegetical methods as Gematria, Temurah, and Notariqon, which on the
very face of the argument seem to condemn a system which aimed at
supplying mankind with a great and beautiful truth.

We should not like to say that Aleister Crowley's poems are entirely
guiltless of the accusation of obscurity; but to the uninitiated more lies
below the surface than is ever dreamt of; and we do not consider that the use
which he frequently makes of words, or rather names of an inward grace,
should be considered as obscure. It is not difficult for the most uninstructed
in the Qabalah to discover that Binah is equivalent to inspiration or
understanding, that Chokmah means wisdom or revelation, or in fact to
grasp the simpler ideas contained in the Sephirotic Scheme. Without such
knowledge, in fact, half the pleasure is lost in not understanding these
poems, and a false idea of an attempt to "flummox" the reader's mind arises.
A mystery is simply an unanswered riddle. If to a person who knows not a
single word of Urdu, I use such expressions as "suar," "sala," "bahinchut,"
they to his mind will be entirely sterile of meaning; but not so, however, to
the initiated, who would highly appreciate them (unless applied to himself).
Such use of words appears only absurd to these who fail to understand their
meaning. A word may be charged with meaning just as a battery may be
charged with electricity. Unconditionally there is little difference, beyond
the literation, between "Hocus-pocus" and "Gee-up." If I say the latter to my
towel-horse, I do not expect it to break into a canter; if, however, I say it to
my pony, and it holds the key of this mystery, I do; so with any other word. I
_____________________________________________________________________________________
say "hocus-pocus," and the gullible are wrapped in mystery; or better I say
"Hoc Est Corpus" over some bread and wine, and the devout suppliant
becomes filled with religious fervour. As in physics there is a kinetic force,
so in metaphysics there is a kinetic ideation. To the Qabalist, the Qabalah
unlocks as a key the corridor of the soul, and the pent-up sense rushes forth
as some prisoner released from his dungeon, a mingled mass of emotion and
reality. To the sceptic no change takes place, far his mind is sterile and
unable to conceive, but his ignorance in no way proves that the Qabalah is
mere Buncombe. Because a weak man cannot lift a certain weight, that is no
criterion that a strong man cannot. There is truth in everything, and truth lies
beyond mere utility. If we cannot understand, it is sheer falsehood to say Yes
or No, the agnostic mode being the only right course open to us; yet if it
were put to us to answer such a question as "Is the reverse of the moon
studded with tintacks?" "No!" would naturally be the correct answer, and
not, "I cannot tell you"; for as long as the bastion of our doubt is stronger
than the cannon of our enemies' assertion, we then, temporarily at least,
have every right to answer in the negative.

To be a student of the mysterious is a very different thing from being a
mystic. That the author was the latter must surely be disproved on reading
"Ascension Day" and "Pentecost," that he belongs to the neo-mystics or
theosophists is openly denied in a note to the former poem, and in the
preliminary invocation to "Jephthah." In which latter poem the following
may be aptly quoted as showing how that, when reason lies fallow, modern
spiritism is steadily supplanting Christianity:

              Master, the night is falling yet again.
                       I hear dim tramplings of unholy forces:
              I see the assembly of the foully slain:
                       The scent of murder steams: riderless horses
              Gallop across the earth, and seek the inane:
                       The sun and moon are shaken in their courses:
              The kings are gathered, and the vultures fall
              Screaming, to hold their ghastly festival.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 66.

The search after Mystery is finely described in the opening dedication of
"The Songs of the Spirit":
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               Mine was the holy fire that drew
               Its perfect passion from the dew,
               And all the flowers that blushed and blew
                       On sunny slopes by little brooks.
               Mine the desire that brushed aside
               The thorns, and would not be denied,
               And sought, more eager than a bride,
                       The cold grey secret wan and wide of sacred
                                books.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 29.

It is in this search that the soul unfurls its wings and sweeps into the infinite
ether of existence, bending its course towards God in its own unutterable
ideal.

               With burning eyes intent to penetrate
               The black circumference, and find out God.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 32.

In "The Alchemist," or in that beautiful poem "The Farewell of Paracelsus to
Aprile." "Struggling in vain to what one hopes the best."* We find this
larger hope is here the keynote, as it is in so many of Crowley's poems; to
mention perhaps the most noted, we find this sacred flame flashing forth in
"Aceldama," "Paracelsus," "The Ultimate Voyage," "The Nameless Quest,"
"The Neophyte," and in "Tannhäuser." Many of the poems in "Songs of the
Spirit" and "The Holy of Holies," hold fast to this idea; and it is this ideal,
the progression from the Kingdom to the Crown, from Malkuth to Kether,
which constitutes one of the most beautiful doctrines of the older and
simpler Qabalah.

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 40.

The Qabalah guides us to a divine theurgy. According to the Zohar it is
impossible to know God, herein the Qabalah is Agnostic, it forbids the
representation of God, herein it is Rational. The Ain Soph is the "All-
pervading," the "Non Ens" dwelling in the "Non Est," it is inscrutable to
man's mind; this vast Pleroma, Corona Summa, The All, is formless, and is
symbolized by a circle, it is Nothing. As the Ain Soph is the closed eye of
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the Unknown Darkness, so is Macroprosopus, who resides in the crown
Kether, the open eye of the Vast Countenance. And from Macroprosopus
through Wisdom (Chokmah, masculine) and Understanding (Binah,
feminine) there is emanated the Lesser Countenance ­ Microprosopus. The
relation between these two is idealistic, being the relation of the Absolute as
it really is, to the Absolute as it is conceived by man. And it is the search
after this relationship ­ God ­ that Crowley so frequently and ardently
depicts. Awful and terrible is its path; the very blood of the heart hisses, as
water on hot iron, as it rushes through its fiery veins fanned by a flaming
soul:

                        By the sun's heat, that brooks not his eclipse
                 And dissipates the welcome clouds of rain.
                 God! have Thou pity soon on this amazing pain.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 41.

Struggling on, the hideous path is strewn with bleached bones,*1. and salt
encrusted heads,*2. of those who have failed:

*1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 42.
*2. The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i, p. 190.

                 So I press on. Fresh strength from day to day
                        Girds up my loins and beckons me on high.
                 So I depart upon the desert way,
                        So I strive ever toward the copper sky,
                        With lips burnt black and blind in either eye.
                 I move for ever to my mystic goal
                        Where I may drain a fountain never dry,
                 And of Life's guerdon gather in the whole,
                 And on celestial manna satisfy my soul.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 42.

All the "Unholy phantom faces"*1. of self, and of sin, will be lost, and all
the misty distortions that crowd the brain*2. will fade and wither:

*1. Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 50.

              So shalt thou conquer Space, and lastly climb

And then:

                                ...there gleams from Heaven
                       The likeness of a Man in glory set;
              The sun is blotted, and the skies are riven--
                       A God flames forth my spirit to beget;
                       And where my body and His love are met
              A new desire possesses altogether
                       My whole new self as in a golden net
              Of transcendental love one fiery tether,
              Dissolving all my woe into one sea of weather.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 43.

In many other of these poems do we find depicted other phases of the
philosophy of the Qabalah; one, the Hermetic maxim, "That which is above
is as that which is below," we find stated in "The Philosopher's Progress":

              That which is highest as the deep
                       Is fixed, the depth as that above:
              Death's face is as the face of Sleep;
                       And Lust is likest Love.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 34.

In "The Quest" and in several parts of "Tannhäuser," we are conveyed into
the maze of mystic numbers, which we do not intend to enter here. "My
womb is pregnant with mad moons and suns,"* and yet we ultimately feel,
on reading deep into these mystical poems, "Too wise to grieve, too happy
to rejoice."

*The Temple of the Holy Ghost, vol. i. p. 166.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
With one number, however, or rather with the primal symbol of all numbers
­ 0 (zero), we shall deal. In a slender pamphlet entitled "Berashith," Aleister
Crowley ontologically asserts the Absoluteness of the Qabalstic Zero.* Let
us as shortly as possible now see how he arrives at this ultimate genesis.

*Berashith, vol. ii, p. 236.

The ancient Hebrew Qabalah was as closely connected with Assyriology, as
it was with Babylonian and Egyptian thought, Hindu mythology, and the
philosophy of the Vedas and Upanishads; its conception of the supreme God
was ineffable, for He bore neither name nor attribute, being beyond the
power of human conception. Over the face of the whole world we find
earnest thought arriving at or towards such a conclusion. In ancient China
we hear Lao-Tze declaring: "What is there superior in Heaven and Earth,
and from which Heaven and Earth sprung? Nay, what is there superior to
Space and which moves in Space? The great Tao is the parent of Space, and
Space is the parent of Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth produced
men and things..." A similar conception of the Wisdom is held in the
Chaldaic, Memrah; in the Vach, or word, of the Rig Veda; in the Honover or
word, of the Zend Avesta; in the Avalôkitêsvara, or Kwan-Yin, the Sakti of
Amitâbha, the boundless light of the later Mahayana Buddhists. Again we
find it in the conception of Prana or life spirit of ancient India; the Atharva-
veda says: "Reverence to Prana, to whom the universe is subject, who has
been lord of all, on whom all is supported." Prana is the Purusha or AUM,
the totality of Brahman, Vishnu, and Siva, of Past, Present, and Future. The
Wisdom of the Book of Proverbs, and the later Book of Wisdom; it is also
the same power as the Eden illa-ah of the Zohar, the Be' Raisheeth of many
Qabalists and Talmudists, the Logos of Philo and St. John, and the Sophia of
Plato.

All the above are Absolute ideals, and so can bear only a relationship and no
proportionate value whatever to our finite understanding, they can only be
watched, and have never been realized; and for this reason is it that they
have never been appreciated by the mass of their so-called believers:

              I will not look at her; I dare not stay.
                        I will go down and mingle with the throng,
                        Find some debasing dulling sacrifice,
              Some shameless harlot with thin lips grown grey
                        In desperate desire, and so with song

Such is the step of their duality, when they face the awful unity of their
existence.

                                    ...their logic fails,
                Their jarring jargon jingles ­ even such
                An empty brazen pot ­ wise men deride
                        The clouds that mimic whales.
                .   .   .   .  .   .     .    .   .   . . .  .
                              Man's darkness is a leathern sheath,
                Myself the sun-bright sword!*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, pp. 104, 105.

Yet Crowley puts into the mouth of Tannhäuser the following as answer to
the simple Elizabeth's assertion, "but God is absolute Good!"

                God slips you, He is Undefinable!
                Not good! Not wise! Not anything at all
                That heart can grasp, or reason frame, or soul
                Shadow the sense of!*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 258.

Such a definition whether applied to God or the Ain Soph is one and the
same. In the Qabalistic Dogmas of Pistorius we read even as regards Kether,
the Crown, "There is no name among Qabalists by which the supreme King
is designated; they speak of the crown only, which proves the existence of
the King, and they say that this crown is Heaven." If so of Kether, how
much more so of the Ain Soph!

Above the Crown Kether, the first Sephirah, is the (}ya), i.e., Ain, the No-
Thing. "It is so named because we do not know, that which there is in this
Principle, because it never descends as far as our ignorance, and because it is
above Wisdom itself."*

*Zohar, iii, fol. 2886 (Meyer).
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"Not only does the Qabbalah repudiate the adage ex nihilo nihil fit, i.e.,
`From nothing, nothing is made,' that is, nothing can come from nothing, but
it does not believe in the absolute annihilation of anything which has ever
existed. `There is not anything new under the sun.'*1. `Not any Thing,' says
the Zohar, `is lost in the universe, not even the vapour which goes out of our
mouths, as all things, it has its place and destination, and the Holy One,
blessed be It! makes it concur to Its works; not anything falls into the void,
not even the words and the voice of man, but all has its place and its
destination."*2.

*1. But Crowleyanity may be new, for it is not under the sun.
*2. Qabbalah. Isaac Meyer, p. 124.

"All things of which this world is composed, spirit as well as body, will
again enter into the Principle, and into the root from which they went out."*

*Zohar, Part ii, fol. 218b.

The Qabalist Abram ben Dior, says: "When they (the Qabalists) affirm, that
All Things have been drawn from No-Thing, they do not wish to speak of
nothing properly to say, for never can being come from Non-being, but they
understand by Non-being, that, which one can conceive of, neither by its
cause nor by its essence; it (the No Thing) is in a word, the Cause of Causes;
it is It whom we all call the Primordial Non-being, because It is anterior to
the entire universe..."

No clear formulated reply can naturally be given to the Formless, all we can
know concerning it is: that Something emanates from No-thing; that out of
the Formless emerges the Formed, how and why remains unanswered: this
alone is the only meaning we can give to creation ex nihilo.

Crowley explains the Qabalist's position thus: "The Qabalists explain the
`First Cause,' by the phrase: `From 0 to 1, as the circle opening out into the
line' ...I am bound to express my view that when the Qabalists said Not,
they meant Not, and nothing else. In fact, I really claim to have rediscovered
the long-lost and central Arcanum of those divine philosophers."*

*Berashith, vol. ii, p. 236.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
"I ASSERT THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE QABALISTIC ZERO."

"When we say that the Cosmos sprang from 0, what kind of 0 do we mean?
By 0 in the ordinary sense of the term we mean `absence of extension in any
of the categories.'

"When I say `No cat has two tails,' I do not mean, as the old fallacy runs,
that `Absence of cat possesses two tails,' but that `In the category of two-
tailed things, there is no extension of cat!'

"Nothingness is that about which no positive proposition is valid. We cannot
truly affirm: `Nothingness is green, or heavy, or sweet.'

"Let us call time, space, being, heaviness, hunger, the categories. If a man be
heavy and hungry, he is extended in all these, besides, of course, many
more. But let us suppose, that these five are all. Call the man X; his formula
is then Xt+s+b+h+ . If he now eat, he will cease to be extended in hunger; if he
                 h

be cut off from time and gravitation as well, he will now be represented by
the formula Xs+b. Should he cease to occupy space and to exist, his formula
would then be X0. This expression is equal to 1; whatever X may represent,
if it be raised to the power of 0 (this meaning mathematically, `if it be
extended in no dimension or category'), the result is Unity, and the unknown
factor X is eliminated.

"This is the Advaitist idea of the future of man; his personality, bereft of all
its qualities, disappears and is lost, while in its place arises the impersonal
Unity, The Pleroma, Parabrahma, or the Allah of the Unity-adoring
followers of Mohammed. (To the Mussulman fakir, Allah is by no means a
personal God.)

"Unity is thus unaffected, whether or no it be extended in any of the
categories. But we have already agreed to look to 0 for an Uncaused.

"Now if there was in truth 0 `before the beginning of years,' THAT 0 WAS
EXTENDED IN NONE OF THE CATEGORIES, FOR THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN NO CATEGORIES IN WHICH IT COULD EXTEND! If our
0 was the ordinary 0 of mathematics, there was not truly absolute 0, for 0 is,
as I have shown, dependent on the ideas of categories. If these existed, then
the whole question is merely thrown back; we must reach a state in which
the 0 is absolute. Not only must we get rid of all subjects, but of all
_____________________________________________________________________________________
predicates. By 0 (in mathematics) we really mean 0n, where n is the final
term of a natural scale of dimensions, categories, or predicates. Our Cosmic
Egg, then, from which the present universe arose, was Nothingness,
extended in no categories, or, graphically, 00. This expression is in the
present form meaningless. Let us discover its value by a simple
mathematical process!

                         00 = 01-1 = 01/01 [Multiply by 1 = n/n]

                               Then 01/n x n/01 = 0 x 

"Now the multiplying of the infinitely great by the infinitely small results in
SOME UNKNOWN FINITE NUMBER EXTENDED IN AN UNKNOWN
NUMBER OF CATEGORIES. It happened when this our Great Inversion
took place, from the essence of the nothingness to finity extended in
innumerable categories, that an incalculably vast system was produced.
Merely by chance, chance in the truest sense of the term, we are found with
gods, men, stars, plants, devils, colours, forces, and all the materials of the
Cosmos: and with them, space and causality, the conditions limiting and
involving them all."*

*Berashith, vol. ii, pp. 236, 237.

Thus from the Hegelian abstraction of the non ens we have at last touched
bottom, and have come down to the facts of real life. Empty space is the
postulate of all metaphysics, but all absolute quantities finally must be
beyond the finitely reasoning mind.


                                         SPACE

This assertion of the Absolute Zero may truly at first sight appear to be a
somewhat exaggerated statement; but on due consideration it will be
disclosed, that not only do all physics and metaphysics rest on this bed-rock
of nothingness; but, that also both abstract philosopher and scientist alike,
have in no way leapt its fiery circumference. When the scientist eternalizes
matter and motion by asserting their absolute indestructibility, he is merely
asserting an absolute unity, which in reality is a synonym of absolute nullity
­ 0=1, but he at once, to propitiate his Reason, forsakes his God ­ (Ain
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Soph) ­ and sacrifices his only begotten son (Unity) on the blood-stained
altar of Evolution, by ascribing to it a tendency to dividuality, thus
barbarously immolating his sacred child by rendering him one with the
divine fiat of Genesis.*

*"Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things come from existence, but existence
comes from non-existence." "The T A O begets unity, unity begets duality; duality begets
trinity; and trinity begets the ten thousand things." --Lao-Tze.

Berkeley, nearly two hundred years ago now, answered the scientists
apparently for all time, by stating: "...it seems no less absurd to suppose a
substance without accidents, than it is to suppose accidents without a
substance." And that, "though we should grant the unknown substance may
possibly exist, yet where can it be supposed to be? That it exists not in the
mind is agreed; and that it exists not in place is no less certain ­ since all
place or extension exists only in the mind, as hath been already proved. It
remains, therefore, that it exists nowhere at all"*1. i.e., in the Absolute Zero.
And again he asserts, this time by the word of Philonous: "Consequently
every corporal substance being the substratum of extension must have in
itself another extension, by which it is qualified to be a substratum: and so
on to infinity? And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself, and repugnant
to what you granted just now, to wit, that the substratum was something
distinct from and exclusive of extension?"*2. And what is pure extension? ­
Absolute Zero.

*1. The Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 69.
*2. The Three Dialogues, p. 45.

Thus the whole cosmic process resolves itself under the one great law of
Inertia; so that the entire Universe lies before us, as Luther said of God, "A
blank sheet on which nothing is found, but what we ourselves have written."
Or again, in the words of the divine Spinoza: "final or first causes are only
figments of the human mind," bubbles which must burst before the finite can
once again dissolve into the infinite atmosphere of eternity. This seeming
duality is that which Crowley infers when he states: "In any category,
infinity excludes finity, unless that finity be an identical part of that
infinity."*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 85.

"In the category of existing things, space being infinite, for on that
hypothesis we are still working, either matter fills or does not fill it. In the
former, matter is infinitely great; if the latter, infinitely small. Whether the
matter-universe be 1010000 light-years in diameter, or half a mile, it makes no
difference; it is infinitely small ­ in effect, Nothing."* In the first case being
infinitely great all else is crowded out, and it=0; in the second being
infinitely small, the unmathematical illusion of the Hindus called "maya"
vanishes likewise in 0. So likewise does Theism resolve into Pantheism,
which itself dissolves into Atheism; the 1=    =0.

*Berashith, vol. ii, p. 234.

Another triumph for Crowleyanity:

              Things as they are ­ of these take hold,
                        Their heart of wonder throb to thine!
                              All things are matter and force and sense,
              No two alone. All's one: the gold
                        Of truth is no reward divine
                              Of faith, but wage of evidence.

              Mete in thy measure, as they are!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 85.

The sum total of the Vedantist Crowley sums up as follows: "'I' am an
illusion, externally. In reality, the true `I' am the Infinite, and if the
illusionary `I' could only realize Who `I' really am, how very happy we
should all be!"* Here we have the great law of re-birth operating nowhere in
nothing.

Thus the universe is laid open before us as some huge ledger, upon which
each being is working as a clerk; some are called directors, some
accountants, some cashiers, yet great or small, high or low, from the amoeba
to man, they are all scribbling, scribble, scribble, and counting, counting,
counting, again and again, "all the choir of heaven and furniture of earth," as
Huxley says, "transitory forms of parcels of cosmic substance wending
along the road of evolution, from nebulous potentiality, through endless
growths of sun and planet and satellite... back to that indefinable latency
from which they arose."*

*Cited in vol. ii, p. 246.

As Crowley writes:

               Where is thy fame, when million leagues
                        Of flaming gas absorb the roll
                              Of many a system ruinous hurled
               With infinite pains and dire fatigues
                        To build another stupid soul
                              For fools to call another world?
               Where then thy fame, O soul sublime?
               Where then thy victory over Time?*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 85.

Some few work out its gigantic columns of intricate fractional figures, and
close for ever the huge volume before them; yet the multitude works on, and
though individually they may falsify and erase, scribble over, or blot out; yet
never at any moment is the inaccuracy of one single mite discounted in the
general balance; so the bitter tears of one man go to blot out the sweet
laughter of another, and as the sparkling stream and the muddy river both
pour back their boiling waters into that great ocean, from out of which they
sun-kissed arose, so do action and reaction once again unite to build up that
great unity which is Nothing. Not one farthing is ever lost, absolute co-
operation exists, and the dividend Mysticus offered Scepticus is paid out
without fault or fail, to all those most assiduous workers whose skill and
_____________________________________________________________________________________
craft never tarries or tires: "In the first year Dhyana; in the second, Samadhi;
and in the third, Nirvana."*

*Time, vol. ii, p. 280.

In the beginning (sic) there is the ledger (Inertia) = 0; in the middle there is
the ledger open, action balanced by re-action (Inertia) = 0; and in the end
there is again (Inertia) the ledger closed = 0. This Idealism, if I may so call
it, is very similar to the conditioned and unconditioned of Hegel, to the
metaphysical unity underlying the Athanasian Creed, and also to the Hindu
Philosophy which Crowley so thoroughly grasped, when seeing the slough
into which Spencerian Agnosticism was bound to lead, he broke away from
Buddha and the Buddhistic doctrines of scientific doubt:

                So lifts the agony of the world
                        From this mine head, that bowed awhile
                              Before the terror suddenly shown.
                The nameless fear for self, far hurled
                        By death to dissolution vile,
                              Fades as the royal truth is known:
                Though change and sorrow range and roll,
                There is no self ­ there is no soul!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 85.



                                TIME AND SPACE

One question still remains before we dismiss the question of Time and
Space, and that is their homogeneity and accidental reality in the Ego. Being
forms of extension, Space permits Size, and Time, Number, i.e., in
Consciousness. This is the meaning of "Time is the fourth Dimension." So
the hard thinking of Crowley arrives eventually at the transcendental idea of
considering Space as a plane, and nearness as Time.

"Can Space be identified with Matter (Akasa, means both), and Time with
Motion?" Crowley answers, "Yes." [For in extension Space is the single
immovable consciousness; Time the extension in number, the motion of the
immobiles. A moving body must move in Time; for it is the succession of
consciousnesses. "It is here" ­ "it is there," that makes us say, it moves. It is
_____________________________________________________________________________________
a succession of consciousness in a single consciousness, that makes us say, it
is of an extended body or idea. This taken together reduces the universe to a
lot of minima cogitabilia, linked only by Time; Anima explained by Ratio.*
Space is Geometry: Time is Arithmetic, i.e., the geometrical conception, the
mathematical conception. Thus, if I {see/think of} a blue pig ten times, that
is ten blue pigs; yet in Space there is but one blue pig. Can we reduce Space
­ which I spiritually comprehend so well, intellectually so badly ­ to a form
of Time (which, vice versa?) Yes, if we suppose that a really accurate
{definition/division} of consciousness would show that only the "minimum
cogitabile" was truly apprehended at once.] Thus in the comprehension of
Crowleyanity Space seems "Anima," Time "Ratio."

*Angelus Silesius also beautifully shows how Time and Space are but inverse measures
of the force of the soul, in the Cherubic Wanderer, where he writes:

                Rise above Space and Time, and thou canst be
                At any moment in Eternity.

                Sit in the centre, and thou seest at once,
                What is, what was; all here and all in heaven.

                I am as great as God, and he as small as I;
                He cannot me surpass, or I beneath him lie.

                Self is surpassed by self-annihilation;
                The nearer nothing, so much more divine.

                Who is as though he were not ­ ne'er had been ­
                That man, oh joy! is made God absolute.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                   BUDDHISM

As regards the beginning of all things the Buddhist is discreetly silent, he (as
Crowley says) neither prevaricates like the Hindu, nor openly lies like the
Christian.

In the Is'a Upanishad we read:

                    Into dense darkness he enters
                    Who has conceived becoming to be naught,
                    Into yet denser he
                    Who has conceived becoming to be aught.

In the second discourse of the Bhagavad-Gt we also read:

             Uncleavable He, incombustible He, and indeed neither to be
       wetted nor dried away; perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable,
       ancient, unmanifest, unthinkable, immutable He is called.

This is very much like the Athanasian Creed, after having defined God in
every possible way, to end up by describing him as "incomprehensible." Not
so the Buddhist who went back to the older vedic conception:

             In the beginning there is existence blind and without
       knowledge; and in this sea of ignorance there are appetences
       formative and organizing. --The Questions of King Milinda.

We must, however, pass by the question of beginning, and see how the
Buddhistic ideals have affected the poetry and philosophy of Aleister
Crowley.

According to Buddhism, existence is sorrow, the cause of sorrow is desire,
the cessation of sorrow is the cessation of desire, which can only be realized
by following the Noble Eightfold path. This intimate connection between
sorrow and desire, as we have seen, is vividly described by Crowley in many
of his poems. In "The Nameless Quest" we find the yearning "For One
beyond all song."*

In "The Triumph of Man" we again find the same idea crystallized, but in
"The Ultimate Voyage," the aspirant, on his spiritual journey towards the
Supreme Knowledge, at one point on his journey all but attains Nirvana.

In many other poems do we find this idea of Nirvana. In "Why Jesus Wept"
we have:

                       Thy flower-life is shed
                       Into eternity,
                       A waveless lake.*

*Why Jesus Wept, vol. iii, p. 41.

Which reminds us of Sir Edwin Arnold's:

              OM, MANI PADME, OM! The Dewdrop slips
              Into the shining Sea!

Again, in "The Farewell of Paracelsus to Aprile":

                       My whole new self as in a golden net
              Of transcendental love one fiery tether,
              Dissolving all my woe into one sea of weather.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 43.

Or,

              Those souls that cast their trammels off, and spring
                       On eager wing,
              Immaculate, new born, toward the sky,
                       And shall not die
              Until they cleave at last the lampless dome,
              And lose their tent because they find their home.*

*Songs of the Spirit, vol. i, p. 55.

Which compares with:

              Till like the smoke of mountains risen at dawn,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              The cloud-veils of the Ain are withdrawn.

              Pure spirits rise to heaven, the bride.
                       Pure bodies are as lamps below.
              The shining essence, glorified
                       With fire more cold than fresh-fallen snow,
              And influences, white and wide,
                       Descend, re-gather, kindle, grow,
              Till from one virgin bosom flows a river
              Of white devotion adamant for ever.*

*Jephthah, vol. i, pp. 83, 84.

We might expect to find this idea in "Tannhäuser," and do in the following
verse:

              This were my guerdon: to fade utterly
                       Into the rose heart of that sanguine vase,
              And lose my purpose in its silent sea,
                       And lose my life, and find my life, and pass
              Up to the sea that is as molten glass.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 227.

One more quotation we will give from the song of Parthenope in "The
Argonauts."

              O mortal, sad is love! But my dominion
                       Extends beyond love's ultimate abode.
              Eternity itself is but a minion,
                       Lighting my way on the untravelled road.
              Gods shelter `neath one shadow of my pinion.
                       Thou only tread the path none else hath trode!
              Come, lover, in my breast all blooms above,
                       Here is thy love!*

*The Argonauts, vol. ii, p. 108.

The true Buddhist scorns the selfishness of heaven, the idea of hell is utterly
repugnant to him, to feel that he is gaining eternal bliss whilst others are
_____________________________________________________________________________________
sinking into everlasting torment, burns into his heart and tortures his very
soul; rather would he be reborn in the lowest depths of Orcus and point out
to others the path of salvation, than attain to the uttermost bliss, whilst others
are being damned. George Eliot, knowingly or unknowingly, set the true lyre
of Buddhism reverberating in her grand and noble prayer, "The Choir
Invisible."

             May I reach
             That purest heaven, be to other souls
             The cup of strength in some great agony.
             Enkindle generous ardour, feed pure love,
             Beget the smiles that have no cruelty.
             Be the sweet presence of a good diffus'd
             And in diffusion ever more intense!
             So shall I join the choir invisible
             Whose music is the gladness of the world.

In the song of Orpheus we listen to the glittering and mystic consummation
of bliss:

             This world is shadow-shapen of
                    The bitterness of pain.
             Vain are the little lamps of love!
                    The light of life is vain!
             Life, death, joy, sorrow, age and youth
             Are phantoms of a further truth.

             Beyond the splendour of the world,
                    False glittering of the gold,
             A Serpent is in slumber curled
                    In wisdom's sacred cold.
             Life is the flaming of that flame.
             Death is the naming of that name.
             .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    .  .    .  .
             That star upon the serpent's head
                    Is called the soul of man:
             That light in shadows subtly shed
                    The glamour of life's plan.
             The sea whereon that lotus grows
             Is thought's abyss of tears and woes.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
              .   .    .    .   .   . .  .    .   .   .   .
              Until the lotus and the sea
                     And snake no longer are,
              And single through eternity
                     Exists alone the star,
              And utter Knowledge rise and cease
              In that which is beyond the Peace!*

*The Argonauts, vol. ii, pp. 110-111.

Buddhism may be called the religion of Science, notwithstanding the fact
that it arose in the East hundreds of years before what we call modern
science was born. The youth of systems, as of individuals, is lost in the mist
of the past, unknown to themselves, dimly apparent to others, they proceed
through wondering childhood, ambitious youth, maturity, and decay. The
crucibles and retorts of the alchymists are but the toys of youthful
Chemistry, its dolls and tin soldiers: God and devil, angel and goblin, are but
the fairies of Grimm or Andersen, or the gnomes who spring through the
flooring of Drury Lane to the amazement of little children. The human first
adores images, then imaginations; the little girl who loves her doll will
neglect it to tend her youngest little brother or sister, whom she will kiss and
pinch in the true fashion of the human; and when scarcely in her teens will
commence those necessary and attractive adornments to enable her shortly
to have a real little doll of her own. The little boy will forsake his brave little
man in tin, in order to watch the soldiers in the park, or turn the coal cellar
into a robber's den, or the garden seat into a pirate's bark, poetically he is
realizing the grim struggle which lies before him; both doubt their toys, and
eagerly peer into the dark corridor of Life, which, alas, is so often but a Blue
Beard's chamber of despair. So with religions and philosophies, in doubt
they arise, with doubt they thrive, and by doubt they are urged on; Hope, like
a will-o'-the-wisp, dances before them, leading them through marsh and
mire, down dale and o'er hill, deep through the frozen forest, and the broad
sun-scorched plain, over seas and oceans, over continents, and worlds, far,
far through universes and systems, past stars, past comets and suns, deep
into the depths of unutterable mystery; and there through the æons midst, the
birth of worlds, in the very womb of Time sunk on some fleeting asteroid, is
the aspirant, "O Hope! O Hope! Where hast thou led me, ever near me,
never with me?" "On, on, O weary one, past man, past gods, on, on to the
rim of Time": then from the parched lips bursts the echoing cry, "Agnosco,
Agnosco."
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The hyperbola of Time, the parabola of Infinity, lie far to the north in the
hyperborean regions of the Unknowable. Knowledge is but a ring smitten
into the face of the waters, around it grows another ring, the ring of a greater
knowledge, around that yet another, it is the ring of a higher knowledge still,
countless rings upon rings surround rings; then, as he has reached some far
distant one, man in his presumption shouts, "I have found God"; blinded by
the glittering projection of circles, dazzled by the greater brilliancy of the
jewels in their setting; "He has found God." "No, no, O deluded one! not
even the ring that fits the little finger of God, hast thou discovered, and, if
thou hadst, it and its God who wears it would be but the smallest gem in the
ring of still some other God, perhaps even of some other man, who worships
yet some other God, who himself is but again some gem in the endless ring
of Eternity."

Yet hope, ever hope; for as a child lisping its alphabet learns how to probe
the depths of dark and cryptic books; so we, we too, have to travel many an
arduous league before we can obtain that crown of Wisdom which is stored
up for us. Be the God that we can, grasp but the first ring, but grasp it well,
and be thankful if it but fit our little finger; trusting that the flashing gems,
fiery in its golden setting, will light our way to the discovery of the next, and
the next! ­ and the next! till we become one with the whirling gems of
Eternity.

This religion of Scientific-Buddhism,            either   through    the  narrow
circumference of its founder's opinions, or through that of his followers,
becoming rational, became absurd, when drawn out to its logical
conclusions, as Crowley himself shows in "Pansil"*1. and "The Three
Characteristics."*2. In the former he bares the fact that in the "First Precept"
Buddha himself, by speaking this commandment, violated it, and in a note
very truly says: "The argument that the `animals are our brothers' is merely
intended to mislead one who has never been in a Buddhist country. The
average Buddhist would, of course, kill his brother for five rupees, or
less."*3. The mere fact of breathing breaks the second precept. Buddha,
being an habitual adulterer,*4. constantly broke the third; and the fourth and
fifth likewise.

*4. It would be easy to argue with Hegel-Huxley that he who thinks of an act commits it
(cf. Jesus also in this connection, though He only knows the creative value of desire), and
that since A and not-A are mutually limiting, therefore interdependent, therefore
identical, he who forbids an act commits it. Vol. ii, p. 193.



                                     AGNOSTICISM

Ex Oriente Lux. As old as the Vedas is the idea of Agnosticism, though in
name it is not yet forty years of age. Everywhere we look we find the
  of Paul, midst the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Hebrews, the
Chaldeans, the Aryans, and the Chinese, and its light is focussed in the
greatest of the great: Socrates and Plato, Malebranche and Descartes, Locke
and Spinoza, Hume and Berkeley, Swedenborg and Kant, Hegel and Comte,
Tyndall, Spencer, and Huxley. Declining the mimetic, seeking the
idiosyncratic, and standing by the eclectic, it has stood and grown a
Colossus of Thought, ever young, ever virile, as age after age has gathered
round it, and as the years have swept by it on their path to oblivion.

Between the theist and the atheist stands the agnostic, and as the most vital
point of attack is that which lies nearest to the object to be attacked, the great
danger to theistic churches was threatened not from the atheistical extremity,
but from the Agnostic frontier. The Agnostic said, "I do not know," the
theist said, "I do," hence the uninterrupted warfare of 3,000 years or more, in
which the priest has ever been ready to lie for the greater glory of his God,
as S'afi well said:

                        Then speak the truth, if so a priest
                May tune his tongue to anything but lies.*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 142.

And of the gods of this greater glory, Amenhatep a few lines further on
informs us:

                For the old gods indeed go down to death,
                But the new gods arise from rottenness.*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 143.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The pantheistic idea, which is so near akin to the agnostic, we find set in the
fine prayer of Jephthah,* and still more so in the final words of Tannhäuser:

*Jephthah, vol. i, p. 78.

                 I say, then "I"; and yet it is not "I"
                 Distinct, but "I" incorporate in All.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 261.

It further finds development in the last four lines of "Ode to Poesy":

                                                      No man;
                 No petty god, but One who governs all,
                 Slips the sun's leash, perceives the sparrow's fall,
                 Too high for me to fear, too near for man to call.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 115.

And arrives at full manhood in such fine lines as the following:

                 God is the Complex as the Protoplast:
                 He is the First (not "was"), and is the Last.
                 (Not "will be")...*1.

                 God slips you, He is Undefinable.
                 Not good! Not wise! Not anything at all.*2.

                 Isis am I, and from my life are fed
                         All stars and suns, all moons that wax and wane,
                 Create and uncreate, living and dead,
                         The mystery of Pain.
                 I am the Mother, I the silent Sea,
                         The Earth, its travail, its fertility.
                 Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness, return to me--
                         To Me!*3.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
What God is in Himself the Agnostic declares is not given man to
understand, much less to discuss, and this maxim finds full affirmation in
"Ascension Day," when Crowley writes:

              I deny nothing ­ at the term
              It is just Nothing I affirm.*

*The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 163.

Man is but an ephemeron:

                      We float upon the blue
                      Like sunlight specks in dew,
              And like the moonlight on the lake we lie.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 95.

Yet he rises:

              Golden, the electric spark of man is drawn
              Deep in the bosom of the world, to soar
              New-fledged, an eagle to the dazzling dawn
              With lidless eyes undazzled, to arise,
              Son of the morning...*

*The Fatal Force, vol. i, p. 145.

finds Freedom as his God:

              And Freedom stands, re-risen from the rod,
              A goodlier godhead than the broken God.*

*Mysteries: Lyrical and Dramatic, vol. i, p. 107.

It was in the winter of 1619 that Descartes made the famous resolution to
"take nothing for truth without the clear knowledge that it is such." Thus
Jove-like he discrowned the authority of a thousand years, and though the
symbolization of his ideas was often at variance with the logic of his facts, it
is to him alone that present-day agnosticism must look back on as its
founder. Berkeley, as we have seen, carried the Cartesian principle to its
_____________________________________________________________________________________
logical result; Hume, on the other hand, "proved that, in a multitude of
important instances, so far from possessing `clear knowledge,' that they may
be so taken, we have none at all; and that our duty therefore is to remain
silent, or to express at most, suspended judgment."*

*Huxley's Hume. p. x.

This, the mob of mankind are very loath to do, for instead of honestly
expressing nine-tenths of their knowledge in terms of doubt, they cast the
whole onus of Absolute or Noumenal knowledge on to the back of some
aching and asinine deity.

By postulating Unknowability, which if treated as an absolute term is also a
positive one (God), Spencer the Transfigured Realist was hoisted by that
very same petard he had himself intended to tie to the wagging tail of the
Christian Deity. Thus by rendering all knowledge automorphological, in
order to annihilate the unity of thirty-nine articles without parts or passions,
rearing himself up, he plunged down, creating in his fall, "a footless stocking
without a leg" ­ Unknowability.

In "Eleusis" Crowley illustrates this, and says:

"Evolution is no better than creation to explain things, as Spencer showed."*

*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228.

Huxley the sublime philosopher, the true agnostic, the periphery of whose
knowledge extended far into those mirrored realms wherein Spencer only
saw his own distorted countenance, seeing well that Hylo-Idealistic-
Solipsism led the whole sentient creation from sub-rational matter to rational
man, was sufficiently a true agnostic not to deny the possibility of a divine
Solipsism, leading rational man to a super-rational God, but yet not
sufficiently illuminated to transmute "I doubt" into "I know." However,
Huxley grasped the great and grand truth that the natural philosopher who
examines worlds, suns, and stars, is in reality only experimenting on his own
"inner consciousness," beyond which to him there is Nothing.

                             These stars thou seest
                Are but the figuring of thy brain.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 89.

This Nothing, this absolute nihility, is again the Qabalistic Zero. Huxley did
not belong to that now rapidly growing school (sic) of crapulous scientists
who inflate themselves, like the frog in the fable, with the gases produced
from an eightpenny box of chemicals with which they intend to solve in
some dingy attic the flashing mysteries of the spheres. The Caput Mortuum
was his playground, but the Anima Vitae eluded his eager grasp; yet this
greatest of modern philosophers, curious to say, stood almost alone, on one
side growling science asserting, "There is no Archaeus," on the other
religion howling "There is! There is!" Yet as a positive and a negative
formulate Zero, so these twain were as one yelping pack of jackals, who
prowl by night fearing the brightness of the day.

Huxley aptly sums up the standpoint an Agnostic should take in the
following:

               If a piece of lead were to remain suspended of itself in the air,
       the occurrence would be a "miracle" in the sense of a wonderful
       event, indeed; but no one trained in the methods of science would
       imagine that any law of nature was really violated thereby. He would
       simply set to work to investigate the conditions under which so highly
       unexpected an occurrence took place, and thereby enlarge his
       experience, and modify his hitherto unduly narrow conceptions of the
       laws of nature.*

*Huxley's Hume, p. 155. "It will be said that these are miracles, but we reply that
miracles, when they are genuine, are simply facts for science."
       "A philosopher has declared that he would discredit universal testimony rather
than believe in the resurrection of a dead person, but his speech was rash, for it is on the
faith of universal testimony that he believed in the impossibility of the resurrection.
Supposing such an occurrence were proved, what would follow? Must we deny evidence,
or renounce reason? It would be absurd to say so. We should simply infer that we were
wrong in supposing resurrection to be impossible."
       "Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio." --E. Lévi, The Doctrine of Transcendent
Magic, pp. 121, 158; also vide p.192.

This is the method of true science, the great white magic of the Black
Goddess:

               Gape wide, O hideous mouth, and suck
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                        This heart's blood, drain it down, expunge
              This sweetening life of mire and muck!
                        Squeeze out my passions as a sponge,
              Till nought is left of terrene wine
              But somewhat deathless and divine!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 98.

Huxley continues: "The day-fly has better grounds for calling a
thunderstorm supernatural than has man, with his experience of an
infinitesimal fraction of duration, to say that the most astonishing event that
can be imagined is beyond the scope of natural causes."* And that there is
no such thing as the violation of the laws of nature, but merely a violation of
that understanding which falsely interprets a "something" which reason
alone cannot grasp.

*Huxley's Hume, p. 156.

How different is this agnosticism from the agnosticism of Spencer; which
postulates as its first great principle, the unknowability of the Absolute, of
whom we can conceive no proportion whatsoever, but whose relationship to
us becomes closer and closer as we proceed along the way of the knowable ­
and perhaps actually becomes known when we ourselves become
unknowable, i.e., pure adepts. The second great principle is the Conservation
of Matter and Energy, or in other words the law of Cause and Effect. A law
we have gone to some length in demonstrating to be apodictically untenable,
though highly probably à posteriori. Crowley, like Hume and Huxley, solely
identifies it as a law based upon inference. This sequence of events is vividly
demonstrated in "The Mother's Tragedy." Cora thinks, "God hath made
smooth the road beneath the hearse of my forgetful age." Not so however:

              They know not, learn not, cannot calculate
              How subtly Fate
              Weaves its fine mesh, perceiving how to wait;
              Or how accumulate
              The trifles that shall make it master yet
              Of the strong soul that bade itself forget.*

*The Mother's Tragedy, vol. i, pp. 156-7.
       Qabalistic Dogma of Pistorius.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                           Factum fatum quia fatum verbum est.
       A supreme reason governs all, and hence there is no fatality; all which is must be;
all which happens ought to take place. An accomplished fact is irrevocable as destiny, but
destiny is the reason of the Supreme Intelligence. --The Mysteries of Magic, p. 123.

This law of Cause and Effect logically leads us to the third great principle of
both Buddhism and Spencerian Agnosticism ­ "The absence of an Ego."

In support of this assertion, Crowley quotes from Huxley's "Evolution and
Ethics," and considers it to be an admirable summary of the Buddhist
doctrine.*

*The Sword of Song, Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 246.

The Ego does not exist. It is morning; I walk down the hill to catch a train;
as I walk I literally leave shreds of myself behind me. I am no longer the "I"
of five minutes ago, fleeting I pass along life's way. A minute gone by my
footstep crushed a daisy, there is woe in the land of flowers; yet a few
seconds past and I slew a fly, there is weeping in the land of insects. I speed
to catch the train, I slip, and in a dazzling flash am converted into a glutinous
mass of jelly and crushed bones. Crumpled as some much-written palimpsest
I am thrown to the basket of the dead, a useless manuscript. When was I,
"I"; in the morning when I crushed the daisy, when I slew the fly, or when I
was converted into pulp? Which? The Buddhist answers, "you were never
`I,'" the Agnostic answers, "You were never `I,'" both merely state ­ see
that on the papyrus of thy life thou inscribest what is good, what is beautiful,
for others must read it, it is thy soul.

Change, change, no stability. The "is" is not as the "was," and the "was" is
not as the "will be"; every cause has its effect: "Freewill" is the postulate of
Morality, "Determination" of Science. Thus in Buddhism we find Anikka,
Dukkha, and Anatta, and in Agnosticism Change, Sorrow, and Absence of
an Ego; and in both: That to deny all religions is a sublime act of faith.

                The metaphysics of these verses
                Is perfectly absurd. My curse is
                No sooner in an iron word
                I formulate my thought than I
                Perceive the same to be absurd.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 170.

And this fleeting changeful "experience," Huxley says, is necessarily "based
on incomplete knowledge," and is "to be held only as grounds of more or
less justified expectation" ... "On the other hand, no conceivable event
however extraordinary is impossible."*

*Huxley's Hume, p. 157.

Thus all changeability is uncertainty, from the Gods and the Suns which we
worship, to the kisses we shower on our loved ones' lips; as Crowley sings:

             Why must despair to madness drive
                        The myriad fools that fear to die?
                             God is but a fervid phantom drawn
             Out of the hasty-ordered hive
                        Of thoughts that battle agony
                             In the melancholy hours of dawn.
             When vital force at lowest ebbs
             Anæmic nerves weave frailest webs.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 85.

And the five senses stand naked and shivering in the freezing night of doubt,
the fire is dead, and on the hearth crouch the spectral ashes no longer to
flame in the starlight.

                                           Foolish prostitute!
             You slacked your kiss upon the sodden youth
             In some excess of confidence, decay
             Of care to hold him ­ can I tell you which?
             Down goes the moon ­ one sees the howling bitch!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 91.

The Agnostic principles of Crowleyanity may briefly be summed up as
follows:

Believe nothing until you find it out for yourself.

Say not "I have a soul," before you feel that you have a soul.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Say not "There is a God," before you experience that there is a God.

You can never understand until you have experienced.

You can never experience until you have got beyond reason.

Those five paths lead us to one road, the road of "Knowledge and Doubt";
beyond which to the inept there is impenetrable night, and to the adept
undying brilliancy. "Know or Doubt! is the alternative of highwayman
Huxley; `Believe' is not to be admitted; this is a fundamental; in this
agnosticism can never change; this must ever command our moral, as our
intellectual assent."*

*The Sword of Song, vol. ii, p. 208.

Thus Reason ends by whispering: "I am agnostic; I cannot answer yea or
nay." This is the crowning triumph of the nineteenth century! Kant has
proved beyond all doubt, that by empirical means we can never hope to
penetrate beyond the tremendous night of Reason; then came Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel, they, peering into the depths of the Darkness, here and
there saw some fleeting asteroid; after them came Huxley, who glooming
into the depths, far in the distance, saw the whirling cloud of stars, still
beyond him must we go, beyond that trembling cloud which hovers as some
tired dove on the horizon of our minds, past nebulæ of stars and molten suns
singing midst new-born spheres and hoary-headed worlds, "I would that I
were the sky that I might be all eyes to behold thee," till the stars circle
about us, and the wild comets speed by, and suns embrace suns, and the
moons melt shrieking through the firmament. Then all powers will dissolve,
and the great golden dawn effulgent will flash through the portals of night,
standing before us bride of our desire, robed in a minion suns, the stars
flaming in her hair, incarnate symbol of perpetual youth.

So we feel with Crowley that:

              Time and again, in the History of Science, a period has arrived
       when, gorged with facts, she has sunk into a lethargy of reflection
       accompanied by appalling nightmares in the shape of impossible
       theories.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*The Sword of Song, p. 207.

And that:

             History affirms that such a deadlock is invariably the prelude to
       a new enlightenment; by such steps we have advanced, by such we
       shall advance. The "horror of great darkness" which is scepticism
       must ever be broken by some heroic master soul, intolerant of the
       Cosmic agony.*

*The Sword of Song, p. 207.

The sun of true Agnosticism breaks through Buddhism (vol. ii, p. 247), and
now the Vega of illuminism, the flashing star of Crowleyanity drowns the
sun of Agnosticism, and reduces the whole infinite ether to a flaming Crown
of glory. This, all yearning hearts must hope, will be the great golden
coronation of the centuries hereafter.

Surrounded by fools on every side, we are apt as Agnostics to consider
ourselves the only torch-bearers of truth; and through ignorance, joining
ourselves to a particular body, hoist on high our spluttering brand of
mundane tar, declaring we have discovered that light which moved on the
face of the waters, before sun or moon or stars were created. We rank the
great adepts with the madmen of God, whose miracles are mere imitations,
whose powers are mere pretensions, and whose illumination is mere
reflection; but what is it then these great beings imitate, pretend to, or
reflect? Here lies the dark question which no denial can disprove, no
assertion comprehend, and which work alone through the alembic of our
hearts can reveal and accomplish.


                                THE ADEPTS

It is this something, this light which every Adept sets out to discover; for,
whether in the dark night of the neophyte, or the noonday brilliancy of the
supreme magus, Reason deserts us, and we at length are forced to seek a
diviner illumination beyond those dark realms of rational understanding.

Crowley writes on this point, in "Eleusis," as follows:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                Not while reason is, as at present, the best guide known to men,
      not until humanity has developed a mental power of an entirely
      different kind. For, to the philosopher, it soon becomes apparent that
      reason is a weapon inadequate to the task. Hume saw it, and became a
      sceptic in the widest sense of the term. Mansel saw it and counsels us
      to try Faith, as if it was not the very fact that Faith was futile that bade
      us appeal to reason. Huxley saw it, and, no remedy presenting itself
      but a vague faith in the possibilities of human evolution, called
      himself an agnostic: Kant saw it for a moment, but it soon hid itself
      behind his terminology; Spencer saw it, and tried to gloss it over by
      smooth talk, and to bury it beneath the ponderous tomes of his
      unwieldy erudition.*

*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228.

This may be further amplified by the following quotation from
Eckartshausen:

                In time and space knowledge is but relative. Is it not true that
      all which we call reality is but relative, for absolute truth is not to be
      found in the phenomenal world. Thus your natural reason does not
      possess its true essence, but only the appearance of truth and light:
      and the more the essence of light inwardly fades, and the man
      confuses himself with this appearance, and gropes vainly after the
      dazzling phantasmal images he conjures.*

*The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, p. 3.

This appearance of Truth is practically what the Hindu would call "maya,"
in which all created beings live. There is a way which leads beyond it, and
any man can discover it, if he be fit and willing, and this way leads to God.

                The Absolute Truth lying in the centre of mystery is like the
      sun, it blinds ordinary sight, and man sees only the shadow. The eagle
      alone can gaze at the dazzling light, likewise only the prepared soul
      can bear its lustre. Nevertheless the great Something which is the
      inmost of the Holy mysteries has never been hidden from the piercing
      gaze of him who can bear the light.*

*The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, p. 30.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The whole progress of the Adept is to speed out of this changing shadow-
land into the full blaze of the sunlight; in the words of the Qabalist, "to attain
to the Crown," and those of the Christ, "To be one with the Father." Now a
curious vista opens out before our gaze, and it is this; A man or woman to
become an adept need neither possess great intellect, great genius, nor great
knowledge, in fact, in many cases the more ignorant and crass have been the
aspirants, the more speedy has been their illumination (Christ the carpenter);
for the less have they had to conquer, and the lower, and therefore less
rational, have been their symbols. "Most others, especially Hinduism and
Buddhism, lose themselves in metaphysical speculation only proper to those
who are already Adepts."*1. Ignorance or Knowledge have nothing to do
with illumination any more than pig has to do with Chicago pork; yet as
there are standards of knowledge, so are there degrees of illumination; for
there is not the slightest doubt that Booth and Robert Evans stand on a much
lower footing than a St. Augustine or a Paracelsus; yet nevertheless,
Boehme, who was only a shoemaker, ranks with them.*2. "It is no doubt
more difficult," writes Crowley, "to learn `Paradise Lost' by heart than `We
are seven,' but when you have done it, you are no better at figure
skating."*3. So a Boehme may rank with an Augustine, whilst an Evans may
not.

*1. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 220.
*2. Whittling shoe soles seems at one time to have been a special calling for mystics,
besides Jacob Boehme, there was George Fox, and John Bunyan; also Eliphas Lévi was
the son of a shoemaker. It might be noted here that in India all leather workers are
considered unclean, and in caste rank with sweepers and pork butchers.
*3. Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 228. After the colossal fable of OEdipus we find the gracious poem
of Psyche, which was certainly not invented by Apuleius. The great magical arcanum
reappears here under the figure of a mysterious union between a god and a weak mortal
abandoned alone and naked on a rock. Psyche must remain in ignorance of the secret of
her ideal royalty, and if she behold her husband she must lose him. --E. Lévi, The
Doctrine of Transcendent Magic, p. 16.

Inspiration does not enter into the understanding, it illuminates a deeper part
of the Ego, and under its influence the imagination is diverted from the
speculative understanding to more active powers which release the
imprisoned "I." When once these powers are released from the earthy grasp
of the understanding, and the Ego sloughs its outward empirical skin, we
then become mystics; nevertheless, "If any man say, I love God, and hateth
his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
how can he love God whom he seeth not." So the mystic's work lies here in
life, and the greatest and most divine mystics have probably been those
whose naïveté of soul was such, that they knew not that they were mystics;
and whose illumination has become so brilliant, that they cannot even find
expression in the most divine of symbols. Such adepts who arrive at so
exalted a plane, keep silence, as Crowley says: "the first and last ordeals and
rewards of the Adept are comprised in the maxim `Keep Silence'!"*

*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 221. "TO KNOW, TO DARE, TO WILL, TO KEEP SILENT, are the
four words of the magus, inscribed upon the four symbolic forms of the Sphinx.
        "To command the elements, we must have overcome their hurricanes, their
lightnings, their abysses, their tempests.
        "In order to DARE we must KNOW; in order to WILL we must DARE; we must
WILL to possess empire, and to reign we must BE SILENT." --E. Lévi, The Ritual of
Transcendent Magic, pp. 30, 190.

                Call "homo sapiens" him who thinks;
                Talkers and doers ­ missing links!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 94.

In his essay "Eleusis," Crowley suggests that the world's history may
roughly be divided into a continuous succession of periods, each embracing
three distinct cycles ­ of Renaissance, Decadence, and Slime. In the first the
Adepts rise as artists, philosophers, and men of science, who are sooner or
later recognized as great men; in the second the adepts as adepts appear, but
seem as fools and knaves; and in the third, that of Slime, vanish altogether,
and are invisible.* Then the chain starts again. Thus Crowley writes:

*Dionysius thus describes the mystical adept: "Then is he delivered from all seeing and
being seen, and passes into the truly mystical darkness of ignorance, where he excludes
all intellectual apprehensions, and abides in the utterly impalpable and invisible; being
wholly His who is above all, with no other dependence, either on himself or any other;
and is made one, as to his nobler part, with the Utterly Unknown, by the cessation of all
knowing; and at the same time, in that very knowing nothing, he knows what transcends
the mind of man." --De Mysticâ Theologiâ, cap. i, p. 710.

                Decadence marks the period when the adepts, nearing their
        earthly perfection, become true adepts, not mere men of genius. They
        disappear, harvested by heaven: and perfect darkness (apparent death)
        ensues until the youthful forerunners of the next crop begin to shoot in
        the form of artists.*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 222.

During this period of darkness comes the swarm of materializing and
secularizing worshippers, who perceive only the gross symbols and not the
truth that lies behind them: "The Church which begins to exteriorise," says
Crowley, "is already lost."* And he continues further on in the same essay:

*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 221.

                Now when Paganism became popular, organised, state-
       regulated, it ceased to be individual: that is to say, it ceased to exist as
       a religion, and became a social institution little better than the Church
       which has replaced it. But initiates ­ men who had themselves seen
       God face to face, and lived ­ preserved the vital essence. They chose
       men, they tested them; they instructed them in methods of invoking
       the Visible Image of the Invisible. Thus by a living chain religion
       lived in the Mysteries of Eleusis.*

*Eleusis, vol. iii, p. 225.

Thus true religion consists in a spontaneous outburst of passionless
illuminism, and not in the regular ranting of the boundless buncombe of a
bawdy book.

                Better be a Shaker, or a camp-meeting homunculus, or a
       Chatauqua gurl, or a Keswick week lunatic, or an Evan Roberts
       revivalist, or even a common maniac, than a smug Evangelical
       banker's clerk, with a greasy wife, and three gifted children ­ to be
       bank clerks after him!
                        .  . .   .   .   .   .  .    .   .   .   .  .
       That is, if religion is your aim: if you are spiritually minded.*1.
                        .  . .   .   .   .   .  .    .   .   .   .  .
                Go out one night to a distant and lonely heath, if no mountain
       summit is available: then at midnight repeat the Lord's Prayer, or any
       invocation with which you happen to be familiar, or one made up by
       yourself, or one consisting wholly of senseless and barbarous words.
       Repeat it solemnly and aloud, expectant of some great and mysterious
       result.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                 I pledge myself, if you have a spark of religion in you, that is, if
       you are properly a human being, that you will (at the very least)
       experience a deeper sense of spiritual communion than you have ever
       obtained by a course of church-going.*2.

The Irishman whose first question on landing at New York was "Is there a
Government in this country?" and on being told "Yes," instantly replied:
"Then I'm agin it,"*1. must have travelled many a league along the road to
adeptship, and if ten such men be found in any State at the same time, then a
period of decadence may be said to have begun; but it is not every day that
ten righteous men can be found in Sodom; for the inhabitants of that city of
the plains, like those of Ephesus, traduce in every way those who threaten
their occupation. "Therefore, O Ananda, be ye lamps unto yourselves. Be ye
a refuge to yourselves. Betake yourselves to no external refuge. Hold fast to
the truth as a lamp. Hold fast as a refuge to the truth. Look not for refuge to
anyone besides yourselves." (Mahaparanibbana Sutta, ii, 33.)*2.

                                       YOGA

Now comes the supreme question: How is this inward mystery revealed?
And the answer is: In the East by Yoga, and in the West by Magic. "Thus
East and West from A to Z agree..."* In the East, by an entirely artificial
and scientific method, in the West by a stimulation and sudden outflowing of
the poetic faculty. The East, we may take it, is almost entirely static; whilst
the West is wholly dynamic. Yet their methods, whatever they may be,
ultimately harmonize (as everything ultimately must do), leading the
aspirant through various stages of illuminism, till he stands out from the
illusions of his birth, and becomes one with that higher glow of glory in
exalted states of Ecstasy or Samâdhi.

*Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 173.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Crowleyanity has now led us through the realms of sceptical idealism, in
which rationalism has been found completely wanting as a constructive
force, and through which we have travelled with satyr and nymph and many
other profaners of the sanctuary. And, as of old, the scented courtezans
revelled in the mysteries of Eleusis, and the vine of Iacchus was trampled by
Bacchic feet, so to-day we find once again the farces of Aristophanes
redacted on the grand stage of the world on which the great actors have
played their part, and have retired behind the scenes. So once more, much to
the joy of little children, the little Rationalias, the little Secularias, the
harlequinade has again begun. Sinbad has sailed away with all his treasure;
Aladdin has departed, and has not forgotten to take with him his wonderful
lamp. No more Jinn are to be unbottled from their sleep of a thousand years;
the moon-faced ones have passed away, some singing, some laughing, some
weeping; and in their place have come the clowns and pantaloons of modern
thought, hurling rational sausages at each others' heads, and waylaying
unwary curates, foolish young women, and the inarticulate guardians of the
peace.

We are indeed living in an approximate age, when in proportion to the
simple distance, instead of the square of that distance, inversely our
knowledge becomes known; yet curious to say, as Rousseau once said: "The
choice which is opposed to Reason comes to us from Reason. We have made
the god of love blind because he has better eyes than we have, and sees
things which we cannot perceive."*1. So are we now making the Sublime
ridiculous, and like the Bhikkhu can no longer see the "dainty lady" but in
her place "a set of bones."*2. Not until we understand ourselves, shall we
understand the world of God, and not until we have replenished the lamp of
our soul with love, will it burn up into a brilliant immortality. Our port to
reach is that divinity which abides in us, mud-bound though it be in the clay
of its surroundings, for as Lamartine said: "Humanity is as a weaver working
on the reverse of the web of Time. One day will come when passing to the
other side, she will behold the wonder and beauty she has woven, in the
place of the loose threads and knots of the reverse." That day God will be
manifested.

The secret theurgy of the ages is neither science, nor ethics, philosophy, nor
religion; for it is the science, the ethics, the philosophy, the religion of all
_____________________________________________________________________________________
times, and when manifest in the heart of the adept, the full blaze of a divine
glory will descend, life will be vanquished, and the soul set free.

To attain to this freedom is the end of life; in this respect both yogi and
mystic agree, and that everything which entails the loss of freedom is sin,
therefore change is sin and illusion; maya, and our great object is to get
beyond this changeable changeability into an unchangeable changelessness.

The yogi proposes to himself no less a task than to master the entire
universe, and finding that the mind has the reflexive power of looking back
into its own depths, does his utmost to develop this power by turning the
mind, as it were, by artificial means, inside on itself, concentrating all its
powers on itself, and stopping it at every turn from wandering outside of
itself. Then the mind, slowly learning its own nature, analyzes itself and
discovers the Divinity which is itself.

                              And I have ceased to think!
             That is, have conquered and made still
             Mind's lower powers by utter Will.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 177.

To attain this end eight stages of perfection have to be accomplished: Yama,
Niyama, Asana, Prânâyâma, Pratyâhâra, Dhâranâ, Dhyâna, and Samâdhi,
the last being that state of super-knowledge in which Self and its shadow
become one, an extended form of Kant's à priori.

Existence is change, and change is sorrow, therefore we must overcome
existence.

             Existence, as we know it, spins
                        A fatal warp, a woof of woe.
                              There is no place for God or soul.
             Works, hopes, prayers, sacrifices, sins
                        Are jokes. The cosmos happened so:
                              Innocent all of guide or goal.
             Else, what were man's appointed term?
             To feed God's friend, the coffin-worm!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 84.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Crowley further states in a short foreword to these "Images of Life and
Death": "To me life and death have most often appeared in majesty and
beauty, in solemnity and horror; in emotions, to be brief, so great that man
had no place therein. But there are moods, in which the heights are attained
indirectly, and through man's struggle with the elemental powers."*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 84.

                Only by energy and strife
                        May man attain the eternal rest,
                Dissolve the desperate lust of life
                        By infinite agony and zest.
                Thus, O my Kali, I divine
                The golden secret of thy shrine!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 98.

The strife to attain to this golden secret we have already seen depicted in so
many of Aleister Crowley's poems. But what is it? And Crowley at once,
with East and West, answers, "a higher state of consciousness."

                That a higher consciousness exists is certain; that it is
      unknowable is certain... unless indeed, we can truly unite it with
      itself.*

*Time, vol. ii, p. 281.

And that this supreme union is possible he explains:

                Prevent sense-impressions from reaching the sensorium and
      there will at least be a better chance of examining the interior. You
      cannot easily investigate a watch while it is going: nor does the
      reflection of the sun appear in a lake whose surface is constantly
      ruffled by wind and rain, by hail and thunderbolt, by the diving of
      birds and the falling of rocks.*

*Time, vol. ii, p. 281.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
In fact, throughout the whole of volume ii of the collected works runs a great
river of esoteric mysticism, which in the earlier works was a glittering
network of sparkling streams.

In "Time" we find the commandments of Yama and Niyama mentioned,
though we must never forget that the conditions of success vary for every
individual, and that Crowley might advise one pupil to drink more, and
another to abstain. He doubts

                That extreme virtue is a necessary condition for one who is
       desirous of attaining this state of bliss.*

In the beginning of "Pentecost" descriptions of Asana and Prnyma:

                In strange and painful attitude,
                I sat, while he was very rude.
                With eyes well fixed on my proboscis,*1.
                I soon absorbed the Yogi Gnosis.
                He taught me to steer clear of vices,
                The giddy waltz, the tuneful aria,
                Those fatal foes of Brahma-charya;
                And said, "How very mild and nice is
                One's luck to lop out truth in slices,
                And chance to chop up cosmic crises!"
                He taught me A, he taught me B,
                He stopped my baccy and my tea.
                He taught me Y, he taught me Z,
                He made strange noises in my head,
                He taught me that, he taught me this,
                He spoke of knowledge, life and bliss.
                He taught me this, he taught me that,
                He grew me mangoes in his hat.
                I brought him corn; he made good grist of it--
                And here, my Christian friend, `s the gist of it!*2.

In "Science and Buddhism" there is a vivid description of Pratyâhâra:

             The work is comparable to that of an electrician who should sit
      for hours with his finger on a delicately adjusted resistance-box, and
      his eye on the spot of light of a galvanometer, charged with the duty
      of keeping the spot still, at least, that it should never move beyond a
      certain number of degrees, and of recording the more important
      details of his experiment. Our work is identical in design, though
      worked with subtler ­ if less complex ­ means. For the finger on the
      resistance-box we substitute the Will; and its control extends but to
      the Mind; for the eye we substitute the Introspective Faculty with its
      keen observation of the most minute disturbance, while the spot of
      light is the Consciousness itself, the central point of the galvanometer
      scale the predetermined object, and the other figures in the scale, other
      objects, connected with the primary by order and degree, sometimes
      obviously, sometimes obscurely, perhaps even untraceably, so that we
      have no real right to predicate their connection.*

*Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 151.

Dhâranâ is mentioned at some length in "Pentecost":

             Olympus in a nutshell! I
             Have a superior faculty
             To reasoning, which makes absurd,
             Unthinkable and wicked too,
             A great deal that I know is true!
             In short, the mind is capable,
             Besides mere ratiocination,
             Of twenty other things as well,
             The first of which is concentration!

             Bloom, Concentration's midnight flower!
             After much practice to this end
             I gain at last the long-sought power
             (Which you believe you have this hour,
             But certainly have not, my friend!),
             Of keeping close the mind to one
             Thing at a time ­ suppose, the Sun.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               I gain this (Reverence to Ganesh'!)
               And at that instant comprehend
               (That past and future tenses vanish)
               What Fichte comprehends. Division,
               Thought, wisdom, drop away. I see
               The absolute identity
               Of the beholder and the vision.*

*Vol. ii, pp. 173-174.

Then we come to the advanced stage known as Dhyâna. In "Science and
Buddhism" Crowley states:

               In a certain meditation one day I recorded:
               I was (a) conscious of external things seen behind after my nose
       had vanished. (b) Conscious that I was not conscious of these things.
       These (a) and (b) were simultaneous.
               I subsequently discovered this peculiar state of consciousness
       classified in the Abhidhamma. That it is a contradiction in terms I am
       perfectly aware; to assign any meaning to it is frankly beyond me; but
       I am as certain that such a state once existed, as I am of anything.*

*Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 256.

This is quite true, for on attaining to such an advanced stage of illumination,
language rapidly fails us, and we break through the dialectic veil and enter
that life which lies "behind," solely expressed by means of symbols.

"What can I know?" asked Kant, as we have already seen. "What is
Knowledge?" asks the Yogi or mystic, and his question is the right one of
the two.

               I see a cat.
               Dr. Johnson says it is a cat.
               Berkeley says it is a group of sensations.
               Cankaracharya says it is an illusion, an incarnation, or God,
       according to the hat he has got on, and is talking through.
               Spencer says it is a mode of the Unknowable.
               But none of them seriously doubt the fact that I exist; that a cat
       exists; that one sees the other. All ­ bar Johnson ­ hint ­ but oh! how
_____________________________________________________________________________________
        dimly! ­ at what I now know to be ­ true? ­ no, not necessarily true,
        but nearer the truth. Huxley goes deeper in his demolition of
        Descartes. With him "I see a cat" proves "something called
        consciousness exists." He denies the assertion of duality; he has no
        datum to assert the denial of duality. I have.
                     .   .   .    .   .   .  .    . .  .   .   .  .
              Their (the mystics of all lands) endeavour has been to slow the
        rate of change; their methods perfect quietude of body and mind,
        produced in varied, and too often vicious, ways. Regularisation of the
        breathing is the best known formula. Their results are contemptible,
        we must admit; but only so because empirical. An unwarranted
        reverence has overlaid the watchfulness which science would have
        enjoined, and the result is muck and misery, the wreck of a noble
        study.
              But what is the fact upon which all agree? The one fact whose
        knowledge has been since religion began the all-sufficient passport to
        their doubtfully-desirable company?
              This: that "I see a cat" is not only an unwarranted assumption,
        but a lie; that the duality of consciousness ceases suddenly, once the
        rate of change has been sufficiently slowed down, so that, even for a
        few seconds, the relation of subject and object remains impregnable.*

*Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, pp. 207-208.

This state of relationship is either a very high stage of Dhyâna or Samâdhi
itself, the whole quintessence of the five senses reflecting their full glory on
the mirror of their own quiescence: the sun raised to the power of a
quintillion flaming on the surface of an infinite facetless diamond.

              There is a lake amid the snows
              Wherein five glaciers merge and break.
              Oh! the deep brilliance of the lake!
              The roar of ice that cracks and goes
              Crashing within the water! Glows
              The pale pure water, shakes and slides
              The glittering sun through emerald tides,
              So that faint ripples of young light
              Laugh on the green. Is there a night
              So still and cold, a frost so chill,
              That all the glaciers be still?
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Yet in its peace no frost.
                                  Arise!
Over the mountains steady stand,
O sun of glory in the skies
Alone, above, unmoving! Brand
Thy sigil, thy restless might,
The abundant imminence of light!
Ah!
       O in the silence, in the dark,
In the intangible, unperfumed,
Ingust abyss, abide and mark
The mind's magnificence assumed
In the soul's splendour! Here is peace;
Here earnest of assured release.
Here is the formless all pervading
Spirit of the World, rising, fading
Into a glory subtler still.
Here the intense abode of Will,
Closes its gates, and in the hall
Is solemn sleep of festival.
Peace! Peace! Silence of peace!
O visionless abode! Cease! Cease!
Through the dark veil pass on! The veil
Is rent asunder, the stars pale,
The suns vanish, the moon drops,
The chorus of the spirit stops,
But one note swells. Mightiest souls
Of bard and music-maker, rolls
Over your loftiest crowns the wheel
Of that abiding bliss, Life flees
Down corridors of centuries
Pillar by pillar, and is lost.
Life after life in wild appeal
Cries to the master; he remains
And thinks not.
                     The polluting tides
Of sense roll shoreward. Arid plains
Of wave-swept sea confront me. Nay!
Looms yet the glory through the grey,
And in the darkest hours of youth
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                I yet perceive the essential truth,
                Know as I know my consciousness,
                That all division's hosts confess
                A master, for I know and see
                The absolute identity
                Of the beholder and the vision.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. i, pp. 175-176.

In a note to "Time," Dr. Maudsley explains the state of ecstasy or Samâdhi
as follows:

                The "ecstasy," if attained, signifies such a "standing-out,"
       , quasi-spasmodic, of a special tract of the brain as, if
       persisted in, involves the risk of a permanent loss of power, almost in
       the end a paralysis of the other tracts. Like other bad habits it grows
       by what it feeds on, and may put the fine and complex co-ordinated
       machinery quite out of gear. The ecstatic attains an illumination (so-
       called) at the expense of sober reason and solid judgement.*

*Time, vol. ii, pp. 280-281.

Crowley's answer to this is:

                Mysticus would not, I think, wish to contest this view, but
       rather would argue that if this be the case, it is at least a choice
       between two evils. Sober reason and solid judgement offer no prize
       more desirable than death after a number of years, less or greater,
       while ecstasy can, if the facts stated in the Dialogue are accepted, give
       the joys of all these years in a moment.

Récéjac says concerning this state:

                When the will succeeds in gaining admission to the
       imagination, and the attention is fixed upon a moral object, such a
       case of mono-ideism becomes the most noble of hallucinations. The
       nature of the facts in this case admits a prolonged attention, for the
       moral object, far from being exhausted like objects of sense in one
       single intuition, extends and increases the longer it is dwelt on. Such
       an object will express itself in the mind which is generous to give it
_____________________________________________________________________________________
      persistent attention, under symbols which become more and more
      intense until the soul, all absorbed in them, is sublimely hallucinated,
      and returns to itself full of eloquence, enthusiasm, and courage.*

*The Bases of the Mystic Knowledge, p. 249.

Thus Crowley again writes of this exalted state:

              Let human thought itself expand--
              Bright Sun of Knowledge, in me rise!
              Lead me to those exalted skies
              To live and love and understand!
              Paying no price, accepting nought--
              The Giver and the Gift are one
              With the Receiver ­ O thou Sun
              Of thought, of bliss transcending thought,
              Rise where division dies! Absorb
              In glory of the glowing orb
              Self and its shadow!*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 183.

And,

              Within the charméd space is nought
              Possible unto thought.

              There in their equilibrium
              They float ­ how still, how numb!

              There must they rest, there will they stay
              Innocent of the judgement day.

              Remote from cause, effect retires.
              Act slays its dams and sires.

              There is no hill, there is no pit.
              They have no mark to hit.

              It is enough. Closed is the sphere.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               There is no more to hear.

               They perish not; they do not thrive.
               They are at rest, alive.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 104.

"Ecstacy or vision begins when thought ceases, to our consciousness, to proceed from
ourselves. It differs from dreaming, because the subject is awake. It differs from
hallucination, because there is no organic disturbance: it is, or claims to be, a temporary
enhancement, not a partial disintegration, of the mental faculties. Lastly, it differs from
poetical inspiration, because the imagination is passive." --W.R. Inge, Christian
Mysticism, p. 14.



                                    MYSTICISM*

This is "the peace which passeth all understanding," a conscious communion
with the Absolute by paths which lie beyond the dialectical; when the
consciousness is full of God and is carried outside itself by a sublime
alienation which cannot be made intelligible in words; and even if we could
do so, we should assimilate to our minds the very qualities which constitute
our minds, concerning which it is equally a lie to exclaim. Yea or Nay!
There is no equivalence of motion in Samâdhi, Samâdhi being beyond
motion, a perfect equilibrium. Yea and Nay are extensions in maya, and can
give no true perception of Samâdhi to the inquirer, beyond a nebulous
symbolization, in which Samâdhi can alone be ill clad, and which word-rags
are by the ignorant so often mistaken for the perfect conception itself.

*The word Mystery comes from the Greek  a word ultimately derived from the
root  (MO) a sound produced by the opening of closed lips. It may be noted here that
OM the sacred utterance of India is pronounced by exactly opposite methods.

To remain before its inquirers silent, as Christ before his judges, is the only
possible status regarding Samâdhi compatible with the Truth. Samâdhi is the
engineer who manipulates the engine. If you wish to discover how that
engine is worked, go to him and not to the (ir)rational cogs, levers, and
wheels; and as to explain the engineer in terms of his engine is to sin against
the Holy Ghost, so to express in definite terms, outside symbolization, the
state of Samâdhi which is inexpressible ­ is also to sin against the Word; for
Samâdhi surpasses all rational quantities including Egotism and Altruism,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Time and Space. Passing to that state beyond progress, which is pure
freedom and divine Will, man reaches the stage when he ceases to think
empirically under the schemata of Time and Space. The mind at such
moments reaches heights wherein another light succeeds to the light of
experience; there is a mental "whirl" which, though irrational to pure reason,
has an incalculable value, probably depending on certain higher laws
unknown to the rational world. When the soul has reached this point, law, in
the rational sense of the term, has ceased to have any existence, and it
henceforth enters into direct communion with the Good; which is its own
law.

Thus when we have raised our hearts to the nth power, we become as Gods
knowing good and evil; and if this raising of the heart, which Crowley so
brilliantly sets forth throughout his works, can in any way lead a man into a
nobler and higher insight of himself, no one can ever doubt then that it is
right for him to so raise it.

We have already seen from Dr. Maudsley what dangers have to be expected
by those who chose this hill-top track to follow. Others from a similar point
of vantage attack it as being pure autohypnosis and nothing else. But curious
to say. if such be the case why is it that the greatest sages of all times have
been able to attract within their focus so many hundreds of millions of
rational beings? they themselves being only irrational and pathological
mystagogues. If such men as Krishna, Mahomet, St. Augustine, Moses,
Orpheus, Pythagoras, Buddha, Plato, Jesus, and a host of equal and lesser
names, owed their power to self-hypnosis, then indeed self-hypnosis is the
key which in this world will unlock the fast closed corridor of its mysteries.

Crowley strongly attacks this kitchen-knavery:

              You weary me with proof enough
              That all this meditation stuff
              Is self-hypnosis. Be it so!
              Do you suppose I did not know?
              Still, to be accurate, I fear
              The symptoms are entirely strange.
              If I were hard, I'd make it clear
              That criticism must arrange
              An explanation different
              For this particular event.

             Surely, your best work always finds
             Itself sole object of the mind's
             In vain you ply the brush, distracted
             By something you have heard or acted.
             Expect some tedious visitor--
             Your eye runs furtive to the door;
             Your hand refuses to obey;
             You throw the useless brush away.

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, pp. 178, 179.
             I am; and by my fancy: if my reason
             Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
             If not, my senses better pleased with madness
             Do bid it welcome. --Winter's Tale.

Others attain to a certain degree of illumination, and then stumble, seeking
such occult powers as clairvoyance and clairaudience:

             Received the gift ­ the Holy Ghost;
             Such gift implying, as I guess,
             This very super-consciousness.
             Miracles follow as a dower;
             But ah! They used the fatal power
             And lost the Spirit in the act.*

*The Sword of Song, Pentecost, vol. ii, p. 182.

Whilst others not attaining, attempt a short cut by the means of such drugs as
opium and hasheesh, the latter of which is most powerful in producing a
state of pseudo-Samâdhi.

             To make me as one dead:
             To loose the girders of the soul, and gain
             Breathing and life for the Intelligible;
             Find death, yet find it living.*

*Tannhäuser, vol. i, p. 256.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
             In the midst of my complicated hallucination, I could perceive I
       had a dual existence. One portion of me was whirled unresistingly
       along the track of this tremendous experience, and the other sat
       looking down from a height upon its double, observing reassuring,
       and serenely weighing all the phenomena.*

*The Hasheesh Eater, pp. 23-86.

Probably Samâdhi itself acts somewhat like this. But hasheesh produces at
times under certain conditions severe suffering, and the yogi does not
undergo such, for he leaves it in his wake. Hasheesh may in some way be the
loosener of the girders of the soul,*1. but this is all. Huxley says: "The
influence of diet on dreams; of stimulants upon the fulness and the velocity
of the stream of thought; the delirious phantoms generated by disease, by
hashish, or by alcohol; will occur to everyone as examples of the marvellous
sensitiveness of the apparatus of ideation to purely physical influences."*2.

*1. The girders of the soul which give her breathing are easy to be loosed. --
CHALDEAN ORACLES, Psell. 32, Pleth. 8.
*2. Huxley's Hume, p. 106.

             Not by the pipings of a bird
                        In skies of blue on fields of gold,
             But by a fierce and loathly word
                        The abomination must be told.
             The holy work must twist its spell
                        From hemp of madness, grown in hell.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 98.

Others again do not possess the stability of mind, the natural health and
strength so necessary in this severe mental struggle, and as Ribot says: "It is
all confined to an alienation, in the etymological sense, of certain states of
consciousness which the ego does not consider as its own, but which it
objectivates, and finally, by placing it outside itself, ends by attributing an
actual existence independent of its own."* Others attain but a glimpse.
Maimonides long ago noticed:

*Les Maladies de la Personalité, p. 110.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                Learn that Prophecy is an emanation from God which flows,
      through the intermediary of the active Intellect, upon the rational
      Faculty first, and then upon the imaginative Faculty; it is the highest
      degree of a man, and the term of perfection, to which the species may
      aspire; and this state is the highest perfection of the imaginative
      Faculty... If the emanation flows into the imaginative Faculty only,
      and if the rational Faculty remains behind, either on account of
      original structure, or from disuse, then is constituted the class of men
      called men of the State, diviners. There come to men of this class,
      even when they are awake, wonderful visions... similar to prophetic
      visions... They delight much in them, believing they have acquired all
      sciences without study.*

*Guide for the Perplexed, chap. 36, 37.

But all those who really do attain, attain, and remain silent.

The "Hindu practice," says Mysticus in "Time," "bears out Western
speculation, whether we take the shadowy idealism of Berkeley, or the self-
refuted Monism of Haeckel. All these men got our results, and interpreted
them in the partial light of their varied intellect, their diverse surroundings
and education. But the result is the same physiological phenomenon, from
Plato and Christ to Spinoza and Cankaracharya, from Augustine and
Abelard, Boehme and Weigel in their Christian communities to Trismegistus
and Porphyry, Mohammed and Paracelsus in their mystic palaces of
Wisdom, the doctrine is essentially one: and its essence is that existence is
one. But to my experience it is certain that in Dhyâna the Ego is rejected."*

*Time, vol. ii, p. 275.

This is absolutely true of Berkeley when in the Dialogues he writes:

                To know every thing knowable is certainly a perfection; but to
      endure, or suffer, or feel anything by sense, is an imperfection. The
      former, I say, agrees to God, but not the latter. God knows or hath
      ideas; but the ideas are not conveyed to Him by sense as ours are...*

*Three Dialogues, p. 106.

God to him is a mahayogi.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
It is absolutely true of Hume, but Hume, studiously avoiding the word God,
could find no helpmeet to fill his place:

              For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call
       myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of
       heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never
       can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can
       observe anything but the perception.*1.
              We only feel the event, namely, the existence of an idea,
       consequent to the command of the will: But the manner, in which this
       operation is performed, the power by which it is produced, is entirely
       beyond our comprehension... The command of the mind over itself is
       limited, as well as its command over the body;*2. and these limits are
       not known by reason, or any acquaintance with the nature of cause
       and effect, but only by experience and observation, as in all other
       natural events and in the operation of external objects. Our authority
       over our sentiments is much weaker than over our ideas; and even the
       latter authority is circumscribed within very narrow boundaries. Will
       anyone pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries, or
       show why the power is deficient in one case and not in another?
              ...Can we give any reason for these variations, except
       experience? Where then is the power, of which we pretend to be
       conscious? Is there not here, either in a spiritual or material substance,
       or both, some secret mechanism or structure of parts, upon which the
       effect depends, and which, being entirely unknown to us, renders the
       power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible?
              ...We are ignorant, it is true, of the manner in which bodies
       operate on each other: Their force or energy is entirely
       incomprehensible: But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or
       force by which a mind, even the supreme mind, operates either on
       itself or on body? Whence, I beseech you, do we acquire any idea of
       it? We have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves.
       We have no idea of the Supreme Being, but what we learn from
       reflection on our own faculties.*3.

*1. *Cited in Huxley's Hume, p. 195.
*2. Hume, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding." "We are not able to move
all the organs of the body with a like authority, though we cannot assign any reason
besides experience, for so remarkable a difference between one and the other" (p. 67).
_____________________________________________________________________________________
       This is possible by Hatha Yoga. And some yogis have become so perfect in the
control of their various organs that they have been able to stop the heart beating at will,
etc.
*3. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, pp. 70, 75.

Hume is ignorant of the Supreme Being, yet his ignorance is so naive, that
he all but lifted the veil of Isis. His "Ignorance" is in every way equivalent to
Berkeley's "God."

It is absolutely true of Kant, who set himself the question, "Must we believe
that Mysticism is like some vast ocean, the empire of illusion?"* And then
again and again answered in the negative.

*Critique of Pure Reason, i, p. 304.

He proposed time after time that Reason be its own end, founded upon Right
and Duty, and in the Freedom of the "Person," the moral sublimity of
"Duty":

               It is not so much because it is subject to the moral law that the
       person has sublimity, but because it gives that law to itself, and is not
       subject to it on any other condition.*

*The Bases of Morals, p. 87.

Expressing himself with regard to the free-being, Kant says: "In him no act
would be born, and no act would perish."*

*Critique of Pure Reason, p. 140.

In other words the "free-being" is a "yogi" pure and simple.

Kant's à priori takes the place of Hume's "Ignorance," which we have seen
was none other than Berkeley's "God."

It is absolutely true of Huxley, who was as astute a thinker as Hume:

               The succession of mental states in ideation is not fortuitous...
               Thus the idea of the word horse presented itself to my mind,
       and was followed in quick succession by the idea of four legs, hoofs,
       teeth, rider, saddle, racing, cheating; all of which ideas are connected
_____________________________________________________________________________________
      in my experience with the impression, or the idea, of a horse and with
      one another, by the relations of contiguity and succession (a). No
      great attention to what passes in the mind is needful to prove that our
      trains of thought are neither to be arrested, nor even permanently
      controlled, by our desires or emotions. Nevertheless, they are largely
      influenced by them. In the presence of a strong desire, or emotion, the
      stream of thought no longer flows on in a straight course, but seems,
      as it were, to eddy round the idea of that which is the object of the
      emotion. Every one who has "eaten his bread in sorrow," knows how
      strangely the current of ideas whirls about the conception of the object
      of regret or remorse as a centre; every now and then, indeed, breaking
      away into the new tracts suggested by passing associations (b), but
      still returning to the central thought. Few can have been so happy as to
      have escaped the social bore, whose pet notion is certain to crop up
      whatever topic is started; while the fixed idea of the monomaniac (c)
      is but the extreme form of the same phenomenon.
              And as, on the one hand, it is so hard to drive away the thought
      we would fain be rid of; so, upon the other, the pleasant imaginations
      which we would so gladly retain are, sooner or later, jostled away by
      the crowd of claimants for birth (d) into the world of consciousness;
      which hover as a sort of psychical possibilities, or inverse ghosts the
      bodily presentments of spiritual phenomena to be, in the limbo of the
      brain. To that form of desire which is called "attention," the train of
      thought, held fast, for a time, in the desired direction, seems ever
      striving to get on to another line (e), and the junctions and sidings are
      so multitudinous.*

              (a) Yoga teaches that by concentrating the whole mind upon
      "horse" these ideas will be withheld, and the ultimate state arrived at
      will be "horse" pure and simple (ecstasy).
              [But this theory involves Scholastic-Realism; like all others, it
      is a false reflection of the L.V.X.]
              (b) This breaking away Yoga prevents.
              (c) Conscious or sub-conscious, but not superconscious.
              (d) This birth is prevented by Yoga.
              (e) This is overcome by Yoga.

*Huxley's Hume, p. 107.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Huxley, like Hume, diagnosed with an almost incredible minuteness all the
symptoms of this mental unstability, but could not in all the wonders of their
laboratories, and in all the wisdom of their pharmacopoeia, discover a single
or certain cure; and yet, strange to say, it is within the grasp of all from the
most ignorant clodhopper to the most sapient sage.

Now turning back from the present day, we shall find that amongst those,
whom we may call the divine philosophers, those in the West have in their
illumination triumphed over those in the East. And as the spontaneous
flashing of the heavens is a grander sight than the watching of an artificial
thunderstorm produced in a halfpenny test tube; so in the West, though the
state arrived at was one similar to that worked out on Eastern principles, it
was intensely more regal and majestic; for whilst the rishi sat in a howling
jungle, contemplating the tip of his nose, the mystic philosopher was groping
in the charnel-house of death, midst drear effigies of the living, and dread
symbols of the dead, and lit the same triple flame of glory, losing himself in
that poetic vision of rapture, so entirely unknown in the prosaic East. And
curious to say, that while the East was applying mechanical means to attain a
divine illumination, the West arrived at a similar position on the
circumference of eternity, by a diametrically opposite road; applying the
whole of her artificial faculties to a perfecting of her material needs ­ hence
the growing triumphs of the West... "And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the
Lord: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had
gone down in the dial of Ahaz" (2 Kings, 20).

All the world round the key which opens the treasure-house is Ecstasy.

             Myself being idle for an hour
                    I dare one thing to speculate:
                           Namely, that life hath cusps yet higher
             On this our curve: a prize, a power
                    Lies in our grasp: unthinking Fate
                           Shall build a brain to nestle nigher
             Under the ultimate Truth: I burn
             To live that later lives may learn.

             Wisdom and Love, in tenser glow!
                    Beauty and strength, increase and burn
                           Be brothers to the law of life!
             Things as they are ­ their nature know!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                       Act! Nor for faith nor folly turn!
                               The hour is nigh when man and wife,
               Knowing, shall worship face to face.,
               Beget and bear the royal race.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, pp. 85, 86.

This is the divine union of the active y with the passive hwh formulating
Tetragrammaton, and of the c descending upon the hwhy formulating Christ.*
It is the old story of Dévaki or of Mary, in which the aspirant falling into an
ecstatic state, is visited by the divine essence; in the one case under the form
of Mahadèva, in the other under that of the Holy Spirit; and losing
consciousness of all worldliness, in a boundless bliss the divine child is
conceived.

*Similarly with one voice Eckart and Tauler, Ruysbroek and Suso exclaim: "Arise, O
man! realize the end of thy being: make room for God within thy soul, that he may bring
forth his Son within thee." --Vaughan, Hours With the Mystics, p. 300.

So has it been with all those who have realized their divine self. St.
Augustine symbolizes it under a divine act of copulation.*

*Curious to say in the case of women (e.g., Schwester Katrei and Nun Gertrude),
illumination and ecstasy at once symbolize themselves under the forms of neurosis, as in
the East generally the illuminati symbolize divine union under the grossest forms of
sexual pathology. The Christian saints (celibates), also indulged in the same system of
symbolization.

               What is it, then, that I love when I love my God? What is he
        whom my soul feels above itself? I have tried to grasp it in my own
        intelligence, above all images of things, but at the moment when I
        reach that seat of being I cannot fix my gaze, and I fall back helpless
        into the common thoughts. I have carried away nothing from this
        vision but a memory full of love, and as it were a regretful longing for
        things whose perfume is felt but which are out of reach. What is it,
        then, that I love, O my God when I love you? It is not beauty of
        bodies, nor the glory which passes, nor the light which our eyes love;
        it is not the varied harmony of sweet songs, nor the aroma of perfumes
        and sweet flowers, nor the voluptuous joys of carnal embraces. No, it
        is none of these that I love when I love my God; and yet in this love I
        find a light, an inner voice, a perfume, a savour, an embrace of a kind
_____________________________________________________________________________________
      which does not leave the inmost of myself. There in the depths of the
      soul glows something which is not in space, there a word is heard
      which has no syllables: thence there breathes a perfume which no
      breezes waft away: there food is always savoured and never eaten:
      there are embraces which never ask to end... Some-times, O God, you
      create a stale of soul in me so extraordinary, and you fill me with so
      intimate a joy, that, if it lasted, all life would be different... Who shall
      understand, who shall express God? What is it that comes thus by
      moments to shine into the eyes of my soul and make my heart beat
      with fear and love? It is something quite other than myself, and for
      this reason I am frozen with terror; it is something identical with
      myself, and therefore I am kindled with love.*

*St. Augustine, Confessions, vii, ix, x.

Similarly John Tauler writes:

              The more the Bridegroom loves the Bride, the more bitter will
      be the cup he gives her to drink. "The cup is that she is to cease from
      all her own thoughts... for she can take pleasure in nothing that is not
      her own." She must be made like the Bridegroom, and humbly submit
      to the process, and joy in suffering for his sake, until she "is wholly
      purified from all faults and stain of sin, and become perfectly fair and
      unspotted." Her wedding gift is "The Holy Ghost." He sheds forth
      upon the Bride the torrent of divine love... insomuch that the Bride
      loseth herself and is intoxicated with love, so that she forgets herself,
      and all creatures in time or eternity together with herself... The joy
      that the Bride hath with the Bridegroom is so vast that no senses or
      reason can apprehend or attain unto it."*

*John Tauler, by W.P. Swainson, p. 13.

These two men had glimpses into total consciousness, of which clear
consciousness, as Ribot says, is but a small portion, just as distinct vision is
but a small portion of total vision.*

*Vide note Science and Buddhism, vol. ii, p. 258.

The mystic, as the yogi, sets out to know the unknowable, and as "it is just
as grave an illusion to attribute morality to a stone as it is to think to find the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
supernatural in the world of phenomena,"*1. so in the inmost depths of the
ego alone, itself unthinkable, lies the source of all mystic experience. "I live,
yet not I, but God in me." This is the suspense of Job, the sleep of Solomon,
the silence of St. John, arrived at by fixing the mind upon one single object
of thought, so that the treasures of representation which lie dormant in the
memory, flow towards that one object and overwhelm and engulf it in a
divine glory, as Eckartshausen says: "With, however, the development of the
new organ... the curtain is all at once raised, the impenetrable veil is torn
away, and the cloud before the Sanctuary lifts, a new world suddenly exists
for us, scales fall from our eyes, and we are at once transported from the
phenomenal world to the region of truth.*2.

*1. The Bases of the Mystic Knowledge, p. 64.
*2. The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, p. 12.

When this cloud has been lifted: "Eloquence, poetic genius, and every
faculty transcending human mediocrity, all represent under different names
that destructive, tyrannical power which brings everything under subjection
and which does not permit the reception of ideas except in one single
direction,"* are exalted in one single mono-ideism and the result is a very
high state of contentment.

*Ribot, The Psychology of Attention.

"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first
commandment," to all who would arrive at their true state of "Self-hood."
God*1. here represents any one object, for in the end all objects are the
same. I look at a bug*2. and my five senses tell me it is flat, of a certain
odour, brown, etc., etc.; only phenomena which I cannot get behind; the
mirror of my senses is defective, so I proceed to try one of a more perfect
make ­ the "superconscious"*3. ­ then I look again: the insect has changed,
is changing, it is no more a bug, but a bogey, fire surrounds it, it is Lucifer,
prince of the Bottomless Pit, now a great calm, and the fumes of Hell part,
and the winds roar, and the earth quakes: "How art thou fallen from Heaven,
O Lucifer, son of the morning, how art thou cut down to the ground, which
didst weaken the nations." "Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the
mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the frost of the vintage is
come down." And Lo! There is a voice of the howling of shepherds ­ or a
voice of the roaring of young lions ­ or a burning bush ­ or a flaming chariot
_____________________________________________________________________________________
­ or a still small voice, and joining myself to God I become one spirit with
him. As:

*1. Deus est sphæra intelligibilis, cujus centrum est ubique et circumferentia nusquam. --
St. Bonaventura.
*2. Bug has the same etymology as bogey, bogle, bogus, which is derived from Welsh
bwg, a hobgoblin, a spectre, a spirit.
*3.     Man I wouldst thou look on God, in heaven or while yet here,
        Thy heart must first of all become a mirror clear.
                       ANGELUS SILESIUS, The Cherubic Wanderer.

                O night!
                Fade, love! Fade, light!
                I pass beyond Life's law.
                I melt as snow; as ice I thaw;
                As mist I dissipate: I am borne, I draw
                Through chasms on the mountains: stormy gusts
                Of ancient sorrows and forgotten lusts
                Bear me along: they touch me not: I waste.
                The memory of long lives interlaced
                Fades in my fading. I disintegrate
                Fall into black oblivion of Fate.
                My being divides. I have forgot my name.
                I am blown out as a thin subtle flame,
                I am no more.*

*Orpheus, vol. iii, p. 213.

And

                Nor shall the mind revoke at ease
                       These myriad cressets from the sun;
                Constrained in sober destinies
                       Thought's river shall its ripples run
                       Into the one, the one, the one, the one.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 97. I may here point out that not only in their Sapphic brilliance,
but also in their mirrored mysticism, so many of Crowley's poems are akin to the esoteric
teaching of the Sufi poets of Persia, such as Jeláladdín and Jámi. A very beautiful parable
of Jeláladdín runs as follows:
        One knocked at the Beloved's Door; and a Voice asked from within, "Who is
there?" and he answered, "It is I." Then the Voice said, "This House will not hold Me and
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thee." And the Door was not opened. Then went the Lover into the Desert, and fasted
and prayed in Solitude. And after a year he returned, and knocked again at the Door. And
again the voice asked, "Who is there?" and he said, "It is Thyself," and the Door was
opened to him. --Cited in E. Fitzgerald's Salámán and Absál.
       As do the following lines of Jámi:

              Gaze, till Gazing out of Gazing
              Grew a BEING Her I gaze on,
              SHE and I no more, but in One
              Undivided Being blended.
              All that is not one must ever
              Suffer with the Wound of Absence;
              And whoever in Love's City
              Enters, finds but Room for ONE,
              And but in ONENESS Union.

       And those of Feridoddin Attar:

              Joy! joy! no mortal thought can fathom me.
              I am the merchant and the pearl at once.
              Lo, time and space lie crouching at my feet.
              Joy! joy! when I would revel in a rapture,
              I plunge into myself and all things know.

And again in the Epilogue to vol. ii.

       Consciousness and sense to shatter, ruin sight and form and
              name!
       Shatter, lake-reflected spectre; like, rise up in mist to sun;
       Sun, dissolve in showers of nectar, and the Master's work is
              done.
       Nectar perfume gently stealing, masterful and sweet and
              strong,
       Cleanse the world with light of healing in the ancient House of
              Wrong!
       Free a million million mortals on the wheel of being tossed!
       Open wide the mystic portals, and be altogether lost!*

*Epilogue, vol. ii, p. 283.

The ecstasy of the saints and mystics, is, this entering into the kingdom of
God which is within them.* Hugo de Saint-Victor says: "The soul, dead to
the world and to itself, sleeps in bliss, and yields itself utterly to the kisses of
_____________________________________________________________________________________
the spouse, in absolute repose of the senses." St. Bonaventura calls this
mystic identification synderesis, and describes it as "the joy of being uplifted
to a super-intellectual love." St. Theresa, that in the ecstatic state: "the soul
no longer knows what it is doing... whether it speaks or is silent: it is a
blissful extravagance... I have often been carried away by it... there is such
perfection of joy that soul and body cannot express it... if they could the
perfect union of all the powers would be at an end."

*I.N.R.I.

So Crowley finely describes:

             Death from the universal force
                        Means to the forceless universe
             Birth. I accept the furious course,
                        Invoke the all-embracing curse.
             Blessing and peace beyond may lie
             When I annihilate the "I."

             Therefore, O holy mother, gnash
                        Thy teeth upon my willing flesh!
             Thy chain of skulls wild music clash!
                        Thy bosom bruise my own afresh,
             Sri Maharani! draw my breath
             Into the hollow lungs of death!

             There is no light, nor any motion.
                        There is no mass, nor any sound.
             Still, in the lampless heart of ocean,
                        Fasten me down and hold me drowned
             Within thy womb, within thy thought,
             Where there is nought ­ where there is nought!*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 99.
                                           And yet what bliss,
             When, dying in the darkness of God's light,
             The soul can pierce these blinding webs of nature
             And float up to the nothing, which is all things--
             The ground of being, where self-forgetful silence,
             To emptiness ­ emptiness fulness ­ fulness God--
             Till we touch Him, and, like a snow-flake, melt

                                                            The Saint's Tragedy.

"Is there a faculty of perception?" asks St. Augustine, "independent of the
senses, which, acting by means of an internal organ, is enabled to give a
completer knowledge than ordinary experience?" Crowleyanity, once and
for all, answers: Yes! and this faculty becomes active during the ecstatic
state, under the illumination of which mental representations become more
stripped of empirical conditions, and in an inverse proportion to which, as
the mind withdraws into itself the consciousness is wiped out.

                                  ...its unextended source,
             Became the magic utterance that makes Me,
             Dissolving self into the starless sea.*

*Rosa Mundi, vol., iii, p. 52.



                              CEREMONIAL MAGIC

We have already pointed out some of the reasons which rendered the
illumination of the West so much more poetic in nature than that attained by
the East. We will now show the chief means which were employed by the
adepts of the West in gaining this end.

Though, as it would be only natural to expect, the Christian Church strongly
repudiated the idea of connection between her Ceremonial practices and
those of Magic,*1. for she has always denied relationship to those who live
outside the brothel, the asylum, and the jail; and further, in this case, burnt
and destroyed countless thousands of innocent and erudite persons on the
authority of a divine book she had rendered obscene by her whorish
thumbmarks; nevertheless, in spite of her Lodges and her logic, the greatest
of her sons and daughters, as we have already seen, were mystics and
magicians pure and simple; this no doubt accounts for the comparative
safety and dignity with which the early fathers travelled in the East, and the
greatest of her ceremonies were entirely of a magical nature. I defy any one
to find any essential difference between the Spiritual Exercises of St.
Ignatius and the practices of Raja Yoga; space here does not permit me to
draw parallels, though I have collected a considerable number. And as with
Ignatius, so with other true saints of the Church,*2. and so also with the
_____________________________________________________________________________________
countless magical ceremonies which have tinted the atmosphere of the West:
they are all one.

*1. This term must not be confounded with that applied to Theobald's toy-shop, or to
such jugglery as performed by Maskelyne and Colley.
*2. A good example is that of Hugo de St. Victor. He made a three-fold division, the
lowest being Cogitatio, the next Meditatio, and the last and highest, Contemplatio.
       On a similar basis Richard de St. Victor erected six stages of contemplation:
       1. In imaginatione secundum solam imaginationem.
       2. In imaginatione secundum rationem.
       3. In ratione secundum imaginationem.
       4. In ratione secundum rationem.
       5. Supra rationem sed non praeter rationem.
       6. Supra rationem videtur esse praeter rationem.

Nevertheless, though at heart one, many extraneous differences do exist, and
it behoves any true searcher after Truth to discover for himself the
straightest road towards his ultimate home which he long ago first left; to
ask help of none, to live alone, as he will have to die alone, to heed no man,
to work out his own salvation, to see that his staff is stout, and that his lamp
burns brightly, lest he fall into that great slough of rational dung-wallowing
which besets his path. To voyage like our father Ambrose through thunder
and lightning, past the sun, and the moon, and the stars, as Crowley most
curiously depicts in "Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum,"* that mysteriously
symbolic progress through the Tarot, the ten numbers and the twenty-two
letters.

*Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum, vol. ii, p. 212. I do not hesitate to add here that had
this extraordinary Essay been written in the days of Albertus Magnus, it would now be
considered one of the most important and curious of magical works; many religions have
been founded on less.

When along the shores of the Ægean sea a mysterious voice proclaimed:
"Great Pan is dead!" Christianity was born; and like all the other great
truths, it contained a great lie: Pan was not dead, but he was snoring in that
drunken night which cloaked the debaucheries of the classic day, and as the
night grew darker, and the dismal vapours of the middle ages rolled on,
blotting out one by one the remaining stars of that past wonder which was
Rome, great Pan stirred himself, and awoke. But the crystal wine of Iacchus
had long since soured in the thunders of those dark days, yet, with death-pale
lips, he drank the blood-red wine of witchcraft. "Hark! the cock crows!
Farewell till to-morrow, to-morrow night! A lingering farewell, and kisses
_____________________________________________________________________________________
upon kisses!" ... "Let the sparks fly upward, and the embers glow! We will
back to our old Gods again."*

*The Bride of Corinth, Goethe.

              There is an idol in my house
                        By whom the sandal always steams.
              Alone, I make a black carouse
                        With her to dominate my dreams.
              With skulls and knives she keeps control
              (O Mother Kali!) of my soul.*

*Gargoyles, vol. iii, p. 97.

Crowley's interpretation of Ceremonial Magic, the getting back to the old
gods, so to say, is lucidly described, under the terms of a rational system, in
his introduction to the "Goetia" of King Solomon. It is as follows:

              I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all
       "magical" phenomena; if they are illusions, they are at least as real as
       many unquestioned facts of daily life; and, if we follow Herbert
       Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause.
              Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of
       seeing a spirit in the triangle of Art?
              Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer "That
       cause lies in your brain."
              English children are taught (pace the Education Act) that the
       Universe lies in infinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akása, which is
       the same thing.
              Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that
       the phenomenal Universe is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or
       Europeans studying under Hindu Gurus, are told, that by Akása is
       meant the Chitakása. The Chitakása is situated in the "Third Eye," i.e.,
       in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we can
       assimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so much
       trouble.
              This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-
       impressions are dependent on changes in the brain, we must include
       illusions, which are after all sense-impressions as much as "realities"
       are in the class of "phenomena dependent on brain changes."
_____________________________________________________________________________________
               Magical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class,
       since they are willed, and their cause is the series of "real" phenomena
       called the operations of ceremonial Magic.
                   .   .    .   .    .    .    .   .   .    .   .   .   .
               But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be
       obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the
       circumstances? Say you so?
               I can and will.
               The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain.*1.
               Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's projected cube)
       methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through
       the eye).
               The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish:
               (a) General control of the brain (Establishment of functions
       relative to the subtle world).
               (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.)
               (c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.)
                   .   .    .   .    .    .    .   .   .    .   .   .   .
               I trust that the explanation will enable many students who have
       hitherto, by a puerile objectivity in their view of the question,
       obtained no results, to succeed; that the apology may impress upon
       our scornful men of science that the study of the bacillus, should give
       place to that of the baculum. the little to the great ­ how great, one
       only realises when one identifies the wand with the Mahalingam, up
       which Brahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000
       mahakalpas, down which Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 crores of
       yojanas a second for 84,000 crores of mahakalpas ­ yet neither
       reached an end.*2.

*1. Carlyle also partially grasps this idea in "Sartor Resartus" when he writes:
       "Witchcraft and all manner of Spectre-work, and Demonology, we have now
named Madness, and Diseases of the Nerves. Seldom reflecting that still the new question
comes upon us: What is Madness, what are Nerves? Ever, as before, does Madness
remain a mysterious-terrific, altogether infernal boiling-up of the Nether Chaotic Deep,
through this fair-painted vision of Creation, which swims thereon, which we name the
Real. Was Luther's Picture of the Devil less a Reality, whether it were formed within the
bodily eye, or without it? In every the wisest Soul lies a whole world of internal Madness,
an authentic Demon-Empire; out of which, indeed, his world of Wisdom has been
creatively built together, and now rests there, as on its dark foundations does a habitable
flowery Earth-rind." --Sartor Resartus.
*2. The Sword of Song, vol. ii, pp. 203-205.

This not only carries out the philosophy of Fichte, but also that of Paracelsus
when he said, there is "nothing in heaven or earth which does not exist in
man." In fact this "one pointedness" is the crowning glory of Crowleyanity.
In the East it is arrived at by meditation, "the absolute restraint of the mind
to the contemplation of a single object, whether gross, fine, or altogether
spiritual"* in the West by ceremonial magic.

*Berashith, vol. ii, p. 242.

              Now true magical ceremonial is entirely directed to attain this
       end, and forms a magnificent gymnasium for those who are not
       already finished mental athletes. By act, word, and thought, both in
       quantity and quality, the one object of the ceremony is being
       constantly indicated. Every fumigation, purification, banishing,
       invocation, evocation, is chiefly a reminder of a single purpose, until
       the supreme moment arrives, and every fibre of the body, every force-
       channel of the mind, is strained, and in one overwhelming rush of the
       Will in the direction desired. Such is the real purport of all the
       apparently fantastic directions of Solomon, Abramelin, and other
       sages of repute. When a man has evoked and mastered such forces as
       Taphtatharath, Belial, Amaimon, and the great powers of the
       elements, then he may safely be permitted to begin to try to stop
       thinking. For needless to say, the universe, including the thinker,
       exists only by virtue of the thinker's thought* (Berkeley, Hume, etc.).

*Berashith, vol. ii, p. 242.

"These are real, these illusions: I am of them, false or frail."*1. And they
cannot be overthrown even by travellers in Morocco who administer to
possessed Moors Seidlitz powders, first giving the alkali, and then the acid,
the patients firmly believing that in the effervescence consequent to the
evolution of gas, the evil spirit has been dislodged from their interior. For if
they firmly believe the spirit was dislodged, there can not be the slightest
doubt on this point, the spirit being a temporary part of the "brain," as all
other "ideas" must be from the idea of "constipation" ­ which Seidlitz
powders will also remove ­ to that of Heaven and Hell,*2. which
Swedenborg also dislodges.

At last we have arrived at the close of a difficult yet intensely interesting
journey. Crowleyanity has led us through more marvels than Dante ever
bore witness to in the "Paradiso" and the "Inferno." His may have been a
Divine Comedy, but here before us has been unrolled the vast drama of a
Sublime Tragedy: "All arguments are arguments in a circle," and there is a
home to which we all one day shall have to return, to the celestial home of
crowning glory. Some spur and spare not, others linger, and others dawdle in
the by-ways and lanes of existence, yet the most tardy will one day catch up
with the fastest and a time will come when the tortoise will be one with the
hare. All is one, either a mass of impressions (Locke, Hume), or a mass of
consciousness (Berkeley and Fichte), all is unity, controversy is verbal,
dispute the mere beating of the winds with a tattered fan. Religion is
bankrupt, philosophy is bankrupt, science is bankrupt, none will be
discharged, we must fend for ourselves... Hark!

                We are the poets! We are the children of wood and stream, of
      mist and mountain, of sun and wind! We adore the moon and the
      stars, and go into the London streets at midnight seeking Their kisses
      as our birthright. We are the Greeks ­ and God grant ye all, my
      brothers, to be as happy in your loves! and to us the rites of Eleusis
      should open the door of Heaven, and we shall enter and see God face
      to face.
                    .    .   .   . .  .   .  .  .   .   .   .   .
                Under the stars I go forth, my brothers, and drink of that lustral
      dew: I will return, my brothers, when I have seen God face to face,
      and read within those eternal eyes the secret that shall make you free.
                Then will I choose you and test you and instruct you in the
      Mysteries of Eleusis, oh ye brave hearts, and cool eyes, and trembling
      lips! I will put a live coal upon your lips, and flowers upon your eyes,
      and a sword in your hearts, and ye also shall see God face to face.
                Thus shall we give back its youth to the world, for like tongues
      of triple flame we shall brood upon the Great Deep ­ Hail unto the
      Lords of the Groves of Eleusis!*

*Eleusis, vol. iii, pp. 229, 230.

That which was to be said hereon is spoken, Amen without lie, Amen and
Amen of Amen.
