thousand ladies free. Armed to the teeth, the glitt ering kinght Galloped along t he sounding shore, His silver
arms one lake of light , Their clash one symphony of war. How still t he blue enamoured sea Lay in t he blaze
of Syria's noon! The et ernal roll eternally Beat out its monotonic tune. Sir Palamede t he Saracen A dreadful
vision here espied, A sight abhorred of gods and men, Between t he limit of the t ide. The dead man's tongue
was torn away; The dead man's throat was slit across; There flapped upon t he putrid prey A carrion,
screaming albatross. {3}
So halted he his horse, and bent To catch remembrance from t he eyes That stared to God, whose ardour sent
His radiance from the rut hless skies. Then like a statue still he sate; Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred;
While round t hem flapped insatiate The fell, abominable bird. But t he coldest horror drave the light From
knightly eyes. How pale thy bloom, Thy blood, O brow whereon t hat night Sits like a serpent on a tomb! For
Palamede t hose eyes beheld The iron image of his own; On t hose dead brows a fate he spelled To strike a
Gorgon into stone. He knew his father. Still he sate, Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred; While round
them flapped insatiate The fell, abominable bird. The knight approves the j ustice done, And pays with t hat
his rowels' debt; While yet the forehead of the son St ands beaded with an icy sweat. {4}
God's angel, standing sinist er, Unfurls t his scroll - a sable stain: "Who wins the spur shall ply the spur Upon his
proper heart and brain." He gave the sign of malison On traitor knights and perj ured men; And ever by the
sea rode on Sir Palamede t he Saracen.

,, %(+2/' Arabia's burning shore Rings to the hoofs of many a steed. Lord of a legion rides to war The
indomitable Palamede. The Paynim fly; his troops delight In murder of many a myriad men, Following
exultant into fight Sir Palamede the Saracen. Now when a year and day are done Sir Palamedes is aware Of
blue pavilions in the sun, And bannerets fluttering in t he air. Forward he spurs; his armour gleams; Then on
his haunches rears the steed; Above the lordly silk t here streams The pennon of Sir Palamede! Aflame, a
bridegroom to his spouse, He rides to meet with galliard grace Some scion of his holy house, Or germane to
his royal race. {6}
But oh! the eyes of shame! Beneath The tall pavilion's sapphire shade There sport a band wit h wand and
wreath, Languorous boy and laughing maid. And in the centre is a sight Of hateful love and shameless shame:
A recreant Abyssianian knight Sports grossly wit h a wanton dame. How black and swinish is the knave! His
hellish grunt, his bestial grin; Her trilling laugh, her gesture suave, The cool sweat swimming on her skin! She
looks and laughs upon t he knight, Then turns to buss the blubber mout h, Draining the dregs of that black
blight Of wine to ease their double drouth! God! what a glance! Sir Palamede Is stricken by t he sword of fate:
His mother it is in very deed That gleeful goes the goatish gait. His mother it his, that pure and pale Cried in
the pangs that gave him birth; The holy image he would veil From aught t he tiniest taint of earth. {7}
She knows him, and black fear bedim Those eyes; she offers to his gaze The blue-veined breasts that suckled
him In childhood's sweet and solemn days. Weeping she bares t he holy womb! Shrieks out t he mother's last
appeal: And reads irrevocable doom In those dread eyes of ice and st eel. He winds his horn: his warriors pour
In thousands on t he fenceless foe; The sunset stains t heir hideous war With crimson bars of after-glow. He
winds his horn; the night -stars leap To light ; upspring the sisters seven; While answering flames illume t he
deep, The blue pavilions blaze to heaven. Silent and stern the nort hward way They ride; alone before his
men Staggers through black to rose and grey Sir Palamede the Saracen. {8}

heart , the chivalry Of strong Sir Palamede abides. Now comes irruption from the fold That live by murder:
day by day The good knight strikes his deadly st roke; The vult ures claw the attended prey. But day by day
the heathen hordes. Gather from dreadful lands afar, A myriad myriad bows and swords, As clouds t hat blot
the morning star. Soon by an arrow from t he sea The Lady of Palamede is slain; His son, in sally fighting free,
Is struck t hrough burgonet and brain. {9}
But day by day t he foes increase, Though day by day t heir t housands fall: Laughs the unshaken fortalice; The
good knights laugh no more at all. Grimmer t han heather hordes can scowl, The spectre hunger rages there;
He passes like a midnight owl, Hooting his heraldry, despair. The knights and squires of Palamede Stalk pale
and lean t hrough court and hall; Though sharp and swift the archers speed Their yardlong arrows from the
wall. Their numbers thin; t heir strengt h decays; Their fate is written plain to read: These are the dread
deciduous days Of iron-souled Sir Palamede. He hears the horrid laugh t hat rings From camp to camp at
night; he hears The cruel mouths of murderous kings Laugh out one menace t hat he fears. No sooner shall the
heroes die Than, ere their flesh begin to rot, The heathen turns his raving eye To Caerlon and Camelot. King
Arthur in ignoble slot h Is sunk, and dalliance wit h his dame, Forgetful of his knightly oath, And careless of his
kingly name. Befooled and cuckolded, t he king Is yet t he king, t he king most high; And on his life t he hinges
swing That close the door of chivalry. 'Sblood! shall it sink, and rise no more, That blaze of time, when men
were men?That is thy question, warrior Sir Palamede the Saracen! {11}

,9 1RZ, with two score of men in life And one fair babe, Sir Palamede Resolves one last heroic strife,
Attempts forlorn a desperate deed. At dead of night , a moonless night , A night of winter storm, t hey sail In
dancing dragons to the fight With man and sea, with ghoul and gale. Whom God shall spare, ride, ride! (so
springs The iron order). Let him fly On honour's steed with honour's wings To warn t he king, lest honour die!
Then to the fury of the blast Their fury adds a dreadful sting: The fatal die is surely cast. To save the king -
to save the king! Hail! horror of the midnight surge! The storms of death, the lashing gust , The doubtful
gleam of swords that urge Hot laughter with high-leaping lust! {12}
Though one by one t he heroes fall, Their desperate way they slowly win, And knightly cry and comrade-call
Rise high above the savage din. Now, now they land, a dwindling crew; Now, now fresh armies hem them
round. They cleave t heir blood-bought avenue, And cluster on the upper ground. Ah! but dawn's dreadful
front uprears! The tall towers blaze, to illume t he fight; While many a myriad heathen spears March
northward at the earliest light. Falls thy last comrade at thy feet, O lordly-souled Sir Palamede?Tearing t he
savage from his seat, He leaps upon a coal-black st eed. He gallops raging t hrough the press: The affrighted
heathen fear his eye. There madness gleams, there masterless The whirling sword shrieks shrill and high. The
shrink, he gallops. Closely clings The child slung at his waist; and he Heeds nought, but gallops wide, and
sings Wild war-songs, chants of gramarye! {13}
Sir Palamded the Saracen Rides like a centaur mad with war; He sabres many a million men, And t ramples
many a million more! Before him lies the untravelled land Where never a human soul is known, A desert by a
wizard banned, A soulless wilderness of stone. Nor grass, nor corn, delight t he vales; Nor beast, nor bird,
span space. Immense, Black rain, grey mist , white wrath of gales, Fill t he dread armoury of sense. NOr shines
the sun; nor moon, nor star Their subtle light at all display; Nor day, nor night , dispute the scaur: All's one
intolerable grey. Black llyns, grey rocks, white hills of snow! No flower, no colour: life is not. This is no way
for men to go From Severn-mout h to Camelot . Despair, t he world upon his speed, Drive (like a lion from his
den Whom hunger hunts) t he man at need, Sir Palamede t he Saracen. {14}

9 6,5 3$/$0('( the Saracen Hath cast his sword and arms aside. To save the world of goodly men, He sets
his teet h to ride - to ride! Three days: t he black horse drops and dies. The trappings furnish them a fire, The

Sees hat eful visions in the day. Where are the antient speed and might Were wont to animate t hat clay?Nine
days; they stumble on; no more His strengt h avails to bear t he child. Still hangs the mist, and still before
Yawns the immeasurable wild. Twelve days: t he end. Afar he spies The mountains stooping to the plain; A

her; The cold sweat gathers on his brow. To save the world - t hree days away! His life in knight hood's life is

dews of horror rise and drench Sir Palamede t he Saracen. Then, rising from the hideous meal, He plunges to
the land of men With nerves renewed and limbs of steel. Who is the naked man that rides Yon tameless
stallion on t he plain, His face like Hell's?What fury guides The maniac beast without a rein?{16}
Who is the naked man t hat spurs A charger into Camelot, His face like Christ's?what glory stirs The air around

and obey Sir Palamede t he Saracen. {17}

9, 6,5 3$/$0('( the Saracen The earth from murder hath released, Is hidden from the eyes of men. Sir
Arthur sits again at feast. The holy order burns with zeal: Its fame revives from west to east. Now, following
Fortune's whirling-wheel, There comes a dwarf to Art hur's hall, All cased in damnascen?d st eel. A sceptre and
a golden ball He bears, and on his head a crown; But on his shoulders drapes a pall Of velvet flowing sably
down Above his vest of cramoisie. Now doth t he king of high renown Demand him of his dignity. Whereat t he
dwarf begins to tell A quest of loftiest chivalry. {18}
Quod he: "By Goddes holy spell, So high a vent ure was not known, Nor so divine a miracle. A certain beast
there runs alone, That ever in his belly sounds A hugeous cry, a monster moan, As if a thirty couple hounds
Quest ed with him. Now God saith (I swear it by His holy wounds And by His lamentable death, And by His holy
Mother's face!) That he shall know the Beauteous Breath And taste t he Goodly Gift of Grace Who shall
achieve t his marvel quest." Then Arthur st erte up from his place, And sterte up boldly all t he rest, And sware
to seek this goodly t hing. But now t he dwarf doth beat his breast, And speak on this wise to the king, That he
should worthy knight be found Who with his hands the dwarf should bring By might one span from off the
ground. Whereat t hey j eer, the dwarf so small, The knights so strong: t he walls resound {19}
With laughter ratt ling round the hall. But Art hur first essays the deed, And may not budge t he dwarf at all.
Then Lancelot sware by Goddes reed, And pulled so strong his muscel burst, His nose and mouth brake out a-
bleed; Nor moved he t hus t he dwarf. From first To last the envious knights essayed, And all their malice had
the worst , Till strong Sir Bors his prowess played - And all his might avail?d nought,. Now once Sir Bors had
been betrayed To Paynim; him in traitrise caught , They bound to four strong stallion st eers, To t ear asunder,
as they thought , The paladin of Arthur's peers. But he, a-bending, breaks the spine Of t hree, and on t he
fourth he rears His bulk, and rides away. Divine the wonder when t he giant fails To stir the fatuous dwarf,
malign Who smiles! But Boors on Arthur rails That never a knight is worth but one. "By Goddes deat h" (quod
he), "what ails {20}

And smote his bosom murderous. His nails like eagles' claws were grown; His eyes were wild and dull; but

overgrown With giant , fiend, and ogre burned My sword; but now t he Paynim bars Are broke, and men to

that holy one Rose up, and gat him to the east With Lancelot; when as they drew Unto the palace and t he
feast He put his littlest finger to The dwarf, who rose to upper air, Piercing the far eternal blue Beyond t he
reach of song or prayer. Then did Sir Palamede amend His nakedness, his horrent hair, {23}
His nails, and made his penance end, Clothing himself in steel and gold, Arming himself, his life to spend IN
vigil cold and wandering bold, Disdaining song and dalliance soft, Seeking one purpose to behold, And holding

to Camelot!" "Amen!" t hey cried, and raised the bowl; When - the wind rose, a blast as hot {109}
As the simoom, and fort h did roll A sudden t hunder. Still t hey stood. Then came a bugle-blast . The soul Of
each knight stirred. With vigour rude, The blast tore down the tapestry That hid the door. All ashen-hued The
knights laid hand to sword. But he (Sir Palamedes) in the gap Was found - God knoweth - bitterly Weeping.
Cried Arthur: "Strange t he hap! My knight, my dearest knight, my friend! What gift had Fortune in her lap
Like thee?Em,brace me!" "Rather end Your garments, if you love me, sire!" (Quod he). "I am come unto t he
end. All mine intent and my desire, My quest, mine oath - all, all is done. Burn t hem wit h me in fatal fire! Fir
I have failed. All ways, each one I strove in, mocked me. If I quailed Or shirked, God knows. I have not won:
That and no more I know. I failed." King Arthur fell a-weeping. Then Merlin uprose, his face unveiled; {110}
Thrice cried he piteously t hen Upon our Lord. Then shook this head Sir Palamede the Saracen, As knowing
nothing might best ead, When lo! t here rose a monster moan, A hugeous cry, a questing dread, As if (God's
death!) there coursed alone The Beast, within whose belly sounds That marvellous music monotone As if a
thirty couple hounds Quest ed within him. Now, by Christ And by His pitiful five wounds! - Even as a lover t o
his tryst, That Beast came questing in the hall, One flame of gold and amet hyst, Bodily seen t hen of them
all. then came he to Sir Palamede, Nestling to him, as sweet and small As a young babe clings at its need To
the white bosom of its mother, As Christ clung to t he gibbet -reed! Then every knight turned to his brother,
Sobbing and signing for great gladness; And, as they looked on one another, {111}
Surely t here stole a subtle madness Into their veins, more strong t han death: For all t he roots of sin and
sadness Were plucked. As a flower perisheth, So all sin died. And in that place All t hey did know the
Beauteous Breath And tast e the Goodly Gift of Grace. Then fell the night. Above the baying Of the great
Beast, that was t he bass To all the harps of Heaven a-playing, There came a solemn voice (not one But was
upon his knees in praying And glorifying God). The Son Of God Himself - men t hought - spoke t hen. "Arise!
brave soldier, thou hast won The quest not given to mortal men. Arise! Sir Palamede Adept , Christian, and no
more Saracen! On wake or sleeping, wise, inept , Still thou didst seek. Those foolish ways On which thy folly
stumbled, leapt , All led to the one goal. Now praise Thy Lord hat He hat brought thee through To win t he
quest !" The good knight lays {112}
His hand upon the Beast. Then blew Each angel on his trumpet , then All Heaven resounded that it knew Sir
Palamede t he Saracen Was master! Through t he domes of death, Through all the mighty realms of men And

spirits breat hed the Beaut eous Breath: They taste t he Goodly Gift of Grace. - Now 'tis the chronicler t hat
saith: Our Saviour grant in little space That also I, even I, be blest Thus, t hough so evil is my case - Let t hem
that read my rime attest The same sweet unction in my pen - That writes in pure blood of my breast; For
that I figure unto men The story of my proper quest As thine, first Eastern in the West, Sir Palamede the

                        Their clash one symphony of war.

                        How     still the blue enamoured sea

                        Sir  Palamede the Saracen
                        A dreadful vision here espied,
                        A sight abhorred of gods and men,
                        Between t he limit of the tide.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The    dead man's tongue was torn away;
The dead man's t hroat was slit across;
There flapped upon the putrid prey
A carrion, screaming albatross. {3}

So  halted he his horse, and bent
To catch remembrance from the eyes
That stared to God, whose ardour sent
His radiance from the rut hless skies.

Then    like a statue still he sate;
Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred;
While round t hem flapped insatiate
The fell, abominable bird.

But   the coldest horror drave the light
From knightly eyes. How pale t hy bloom,
Thy blood, O brow whereon that night
Sits like a serpent on a tomb!

For   Palamede t hose eyes beheld
The iron image of his own;
On those dead brows a fat e he spelled
To strike a Gorgon into stone.

He   knew his father. Still he sate,
Nor quivered nerve, nor muscle stirred;
While round t hem flapped insatiate
The fell, abominable bird.

The    knight approves the j ustice done,
And pays with that his rowels' debt;
While yet t he forehead of t he son
Stands beaded with an icy sweat. {4}

God's   angel, standing sinister,
Unfurls this scroll - a sable stain:
Who wins the spur shall ply the spur
Upon his proper heart and brain.

He   gave the sign of malison
On traitor knights and perj ured men;
And ever by t he sea rode on
Sir Palamede the Saracen.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                 ,,
%EHOLD!     Arabia's burning shore
Rings to the hoofs of many a steed.
Lord of a legion rides to war
The indomitable Palamede.

The  Paynim fly; his troops delight
In murder of many a myriad men,
Following exultant into fight
Sir Palamede the Saracen.

Now   when a year and day are done
Sir Palamedes is aware
Of blue pavilions in the sun,
And bannerets fluttering in the air.

Forward   he spurs; his armour gleams;
Then on his haunches rears the steed;
Above the lordly silk t here streams
The pennon of Sir Palamede!

Aflame,   a bridegroom to his spouse,
He rides to meet with galliard grace
Some scion of his holy house,
Or germane to his royal race. {6}

But  oh! the eyes of shame! Beneat h
The tall pavilion's sapphire shade
There sport a band with wand and wreath,
Languorous boy and laughing maid.

And  in t he cent re is a sight
Of hateful love and shameless shame:
A recreant Abyssianian knight
Sports grossly with a wanton dame.

How    black and swinish is t he knave!
His hellish grunt, his bestial grin;
Her trilling laugh, her gest ure suave,
The cool sweat swimming on her skin!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
She   looks and laughs upon the knight ,
Then t urns to buss the blubber mout h,
Draining the dregs of that black blight
Of wine to ease t heir double drouth!

God!    what a glance! Sir Palamede
Is stricken by t he sword of fate:
His mother it is in very deed
That gleeful goes t he goatish gait.

His   mother it his, that pure and pale
Cried in t he pangs t hat gave him birth;
The holy image he would veil
From aught t he tiniest taint of earth. {7}

She   knows him, and black fear bedim
Those eyes; she offers to his gaze
The blue-veined breasts that suckled him
In childhood's sweet and solemn days.

Weeping     she bares t he holy womb!
Shrieks out the mother's last appeal:
And reads irrevocable doom
In those dread eyes of ice and steel.

He   winds his horn: his warriors pour
In thousands on t he fenceless foe;
The sunset stains their hideous war
With crimson bars of after-glow.

He   winds his horn; t he night-stars leap
To light ; upspring the sisters seven;
While answering flames illume t he deep,
The blue pavilions blaze to heaven.

Silent  and st ern the northward way
They ride; alone before his men
Staggers through black to rose and grey
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {8}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                 ,,,
7HERE     is a rock by Severn mout h
Whereon a might y castle stands,
Fronting the blue impassive South
And looking over lordly lands.

Oh!   high above t he envious sea
This fortress dominates the tides;
There, ill at heart , the chivalry
Of strong Sir Palamede abides.

Now    comes irruption from the fold
That live by murder: day by day
The good knight strikes his deadly stroke;
The vult ures claw the attended prey.

But   day by day t he heat hen hordes.
Gather from dreadful lands afar,
A myriad myriad bows and swords,
As clouds that blot the morning star.

Soon   by an arrow from t he sea
The Lady of Palamede is slain;
His son, in sally fighting free,
Is struck t hrough burgonet and brain. {9}

But   day by day t he foes increase,
Though day by day t heir t housands fall:
Laughs the unshaken fortalice;
The good knights laugh no more at all.

Grimmer     than heather hordes can scowl,
The spect re hunger rages t here;
He passes like a midnight owl,
Hooting his heraldry, despair.

The   knights and squires of Palamede
Stalk pale and lean t hrough court and hall;
Though sharp and swift the archers speed
Their yardlong arrows from the wall.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Their   numbers thin; t heir strengt h decays;
Their fate is written plain to read:
These are t he dread deciduous days
Of iron-souled Sir Palamede.

He   hears the horrid laugh that rings
From camp to camp at night; he hears
The cruel mout hs of murderous kings
Laugh out one menace t hat he fears.

No   sooner shall the heroes die
Than, ere t heir flesh begin to rot,
The heat hen t urns his raving eye
To Caerlon and Camelot .

King  Art hur in ignoble slot h
Is sunk, and dalliance with his dame,
Forgetful of his knightly oath,
And careless of his kingly name.

Befooled   and cuckolded, t he king
Is yet the king, the king most high;
And on his life t he hinges swing
That close the door of chivalry.


' blood! shall it sink, and rise no more,
S
That blaze of time, when men were men?
That is thy question, warrior
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {11}



                                ,9
1ow,    with two score of men in life
And one fair babe, Sir Palamede
Resolves one last heroic strife,
Attempts forlorn a desperate deed.

At  dead of night , a moonless night,
A night of wint er storm, they sail
In dancing dragons to the fight
With man and sea, with ghoul and gale.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Whom    God shall spare, ride, ride! (so springs
The iron order). Let him fly
On honour's steed with honour's wings
To warn t he king, lest honour die!

Then   to the fury of the blast
Their fury adds a dreadful sting:
The fatal die is surely cast.
To save the king - to save t he king!

Hail!  horror of the midnight surge!
The storms of death, t he lashing gust,
The doubtful gleam of swords that urge
Hot laughter with high-leaping lust! {12}

Though   one by one the heroes fall,
Their desperate way t hey slowly win,
And knight ly cry and comrade-call
Rise high above the savage din.

Now,   now they land, a dwindling crew;
Now, now fresh armies hem them round.
They cleave t heir blood-bought avenue,
And cluster on the upper ground.

Ah!  but dawn's dreadful front uprears!
The tall towers blaze, to illume t he fight ;
While many a myriad heat hen spears
March northward at t he earliest light.

Falls thy last comrade at t hy feet,
O lordly-souled Sir Palamede?
Tearing t he savage from his seat,
He leaps upon a coal-black steed.

He  gallops raging through the press:
The affright ed heat hen fear his eye.
There madness gleams, there masterless
The whirling sword shrieks shrill and high.

The  shrink, he gallops. Closely clings
The child slung at his waist; and he
Heeds nought , but gallops wide, and sings
Wild war-songs, chants of gramarye! {13}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Sir  Palamded the Saracen
Rides like a centaur mad with war;
He sabres many a million men,
And t ramples many a million more!

Before    him lies t he unt ravelled land
Where never a human soul is known,
A desert by a wizard banned,
A soulless wilderness of stone.

Nor   grass, nor corn, delight the vales;
Nor beast, nor bird, span space. Immense,
Black rain, grey mist, whit e wrath of gales,
Fill the dread armoury of sense.

Nor   shines the sun; nor moon, nor star
Their subt le light at all display;
Nor day, nor night , dispute the scaur:
All's one intolerable grey.

Black   llyns, grey rocks, white hills of snow!
No flower, no colour: life is not.
This is no way for men to go
From Severn-mouth to Camelot .

Despair,    t he world upon his speed,
Drive (like a lion from his den
Whom hunger hunts) t he man at need,
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {14}



                                   9
6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen
Hath cast his sword and arms aside.
To save the world of goodly men,
He sets his teet h to ride - t o ride!

Three    days: the black horse drops and dies.
The trappings furnish t hem a fire,
The beast a meal. With dreadful eyes
Stare into death t he child, the sire.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Six  days: the gaunt and gallant knight
Sees hat eful visions in the day.
Where are the antient speed and might
Were wont to animate t hat clay?

Nine   days; t hey stumble on; no more
His strengt h avails to bear the child.
Still hangs the mist, and still before
Yawns the immeasurable wild.

Twelve     days: t he end. Afar he spies
The mountains stooping to the plain;
A little splash of sunlight lies
Beyond the everlasting rain. {15}

His   strength is done; he cannot stir.
The child complains - how feebly now!
His eyes are blank; he looks at her;
The cold sweat gathers on his brow.

To   save the world - three days away!
His life in knight hood's life is furled,
And knight hood's life in his - to-day! -
His darling staked against t he world!

Will   he die there, his task undone?
Or dare he live, at such a cost?
He cries against the impassive sun:
The world is dim, is all but lost.

When,     with the bitterness of death
Cutting his soul, his fingers clench
The piteous passage of her breat h.
The dews of horror rise and drench

Sir  Palamede the Saracen.
Then, rising from t he hideous meal,
He plunges to t he land of men
With nerves renewed and limbs of steel.

Who     is the naked man that rides
Yon tameless stallion on t he plain,
His face like Hell's?What fury guides
The maniac beast without a rein?{16}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Who    is the naked man that spurs
A charger into Camelot,
His face like Christ's?what glory stirs
The air around him, do ye wot?

Sir  Art hur arms him, makes array
Of seven times ten thousand men,
And bids them follow and obey
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {17}



                                 9,
6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen
The eart h from murder hat h released,
Is hidden from the eyes of men.

Sir  Art hur sits again at feast.
The holy order burns with zeal:
Its fame revives from west to east.

Now,    following Fortune's whirling-wheel,
There comes a dwarf to Arthur's hall,
All cased in damnascen&#138;d steel.

Asceptre    and a golden ball
He bears, and on his head a crown;
But on his shoulders drapes a pall

Of   velvet flowing sably down
Above his vest of cramoisie.
Now doth the king of high renown

Demand     him of his dignity.
Whereat the dwarf begins to tell
A quest of loftiest chivalry. {18}

Quod    he: By Goddes holy spell,
So high a vent ure was not known,
Nor so divine a miracle.

Acertain    beast there runs alone,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
That ever in his belly sounds
A hugeous cry, a monster moan,

As  if a thirty couple hounds
Quest ed with him. Now God saith
(I swear it by His holy wounds

And   by His lamentable death,
And by His holy Mother's face!)
That he shall know the Beauteous Breat h

And   taste the Goodly Gift of Grace
Who shall achieve this marvel quest .
Then Arthur sterte up from his place,

And   stert e up boldly all the rest ,
And sware to seek t his goodly t hing.
But now t he dwarf dot h beat his breast ,

And   speak on this wise to the king,
That he should worthy knight be found
Who with his hands t he dwarf should bring

By  might one span from off the ground.
Whereat they j eer, the dwarf so small,
The knights so strong: the walls resound {19}

With   laughter rattling round t he hall.
But Art hur first essays the deed,
And may not budge the dwarf at all.

Then   Lancelot sware by Goddes reed,
And pulled so strong his muscel burst,
His nose and mout h brake out a-bleed;

Nor   moved he thus the dwarf. From first
To last the envious knights essayed,
And all t heir malice had the worst,

Till strong Sir Bors his prowess played -
And all his might avail&#138;d nought ,.
Now once Sir Bors had been betrayed

To  Paynim; him in traitrise caught,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
They bound to four strong stallion steers,
To tear asunder, as they t hought,

The   paladin of Arthur's peers.
But he, a-bending, breaks the spine
Of three, and on the fourt h he rears

His  bulk, and rides away. Divine
the wonder when t he giant fails
To stir the fat uous dwarf, malign

Who    smiles! But Boors on Arthur rails
That never a knight is wort h but one.
By Goddes deat h (quod he), what ails {20}

Us  marsh-lights to forget the sun?
There is one man of mortal men
Worthy to win t his benison,

Sir Palamede the Saracen.
Then went t he applauding murmur round:
Sir Lancelot girt him there and then

To  ride to t hat enchanted ground
Where amid timeless snows the den
Of Palamedes might be found.* {21}

                               9,,
%EHOLD     Sir Lancelot of t he Lake
Breasting the stony screes: behold
How breath must fail and muscle ache

Before   he reach the icy fold
That Palamede t he Saracen
Within its hermitage may hold.

At  last he cometh to a den
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Perched high upon t he savage scaur,
Remote from every haunt of men,

From   every haunt of life afar.
There doth he find Sit Palamede
Sitting as steadfast as a star.

Scarcely    he knew t he knight indeed,
For he was compassed in a beard
White as the streams of snow that feed

The   lake of Gods and men revered
That sitteth upon Caucasus.
So muttered he a darkling weird, {22}

And   smote his bosom murderous.
His nails like eagles' claws were grown;
His eyes were wild and dull; but thus

Sir  Lancelot spake: Thy deeds atone
By knight ly devoir! He ret urned
That While t he land was overgrown

With    giant, fiend, and ogre burned
My sword; but now the Paynim bars
Are broke, and men to virt ue t urned:

Therefore    I sit upon the scars
Amid my beard, even as the sun
Sits in the company of t he stars!

Then   Lancelot bade this deed be done,
The achievement of the Questing Beast.
Which when he spoke t hat holy one

Rose   up, and gat him to t he east
With Lancelot ; when as t hey drew
Unto the palace and the feast

He   put his littlest finger t o
The dwarf, who rose to upper air,
Piercing the far et ernal blue

Beyond    t he reach of song or prayer.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Then did Sir Palamede amend
His nakedness, his horrent hair, {23}

His  nails, and made his penance end,
Clothing himself in steel and gold,
Arming himself, his life to spend

IN vigil cold and wandering bold,
Disdaining song and dalliance soft,
Seeking one purpose to behold,

And  holding ever t hat aloft,
Nor fearing God, nor heeding men.
So thus his hermit habit doffed
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {24}



                              9,,,
.NOW      ye where Druid dolmens rise
In Wessex on t he widow plain?
Thither Sir Palamedes plies

The  spur, and shakes t he rattling rein.
He questions all men of t he Beast.
None answer. Is the quest in vain?

With   oaken crown t here comes a priest
In samite robes, wit h hazel wand,
And worships at the gilded East.

Ay!  t hither ride! The dawn beyond
Must run t he quarry of his quest .
He rode as he were wood or fond,

Until  at night behoves him rest .
- He saw the gilding far behind
Out on t he hills toward t he West!

With   aimless fury hot and blind
He flung him on a Viking ship.
He slew t he rover, and inclined {25}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The   seamen to his stinging whip.
Accurs'd of God, despising men,
Thy reckless oars in ocean dip,
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {26}

6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen

Unto the smooth and swart hy men

That   haunt t he evil shore of Hind:
He queried eager of the quest.
Ay! Ay! t heir cunning sages grinned:

It shines! It shines! Guess thou the rest!
For naught but this our Rishis know.
Sir Palamede his way addressed

Unto    the woods: t hey blaze and glow;
His lance stabs many a shining blade,
His sword lays many a flower low

That   glittering gladdened in the glade.
He wrot e himself a wanton ass,
And to t he sea his traces laid,

Where      many a wavelet on the glass
His prowess knows. But deep and deep
His futile feet in fury pass, {27}

Until   one billow curls to leap,
And flings him breat hless on the shore
Half drowned. O fool! his God's asleep,

Smiting until the vernal tides

Of  earth leap high; t he st eady flow
Of sunlight splits t he icy walls:
They slide, t hey hurl the knight below.

Sir Palamede the mighty falls
Into an hollow where t here dwelt
A bearded crew of monachals

Asleep  in various visions spelt
By mystic symbols unto men.
But when a foreigner they smelt

They   drive him from t heir holy den,
And wit h their glitt ering eyeballs pelt
Sir Palamede the Saracen.* {28}

Now   findeth he, as all alone
He moves about the burning East,
The mighty trail of some unknown,
But surely some maj estic beast.

So  followeth he the forest ways,
Remembering his knight ly oath,
And t hrough t he hot and dripping days
Ploughs through t he tangled undergrowth.

Sir Palamede the Saracen
Came on a forest pool at length,
Remote from any mart of men,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Where t here disport ed in his strength

The   lone and lordly elephant.
Sir Palamede his forehead beat.
O amorous! O militant !
O lord of t his arboreal seat !

Thus   worshipped he, and stalking stole
Into the presence: he emerged.
The scent awakes the uneasy soul
Of that Maj estic One: upsurged {29}

The   monster from the oozy bed,
And bounded through the crashing glades.
- but now a staring savage head
Lurks at him through t he forest shades.

This  was a naked Indian,
Who led within the city gat e
The fooled and disappointed man,
Already broken by his fate.

Here   were t he brazen towers, and here
the scupltured rocks, the marble shrine
Where to a tall black stone they rear
The altars due to t he divine.

The   God they deem in sensual j oy
Absorbed, and silken dalliance:
To please his leisure hours a boy
Compels an elephant to dance.

So  maj esty to ridicule
Is turned. To other climes and men
Makes off that strong, persistent fool
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {30}



                               ;,
6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen
Hath hied him to an holy man,
Sith he alone of mortal men
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Can   help him, if a mortal can.
(So tell him all the Scythian folk.)
Wherefore he makes a caravan,

And   finds him. When his prayers invoke
The holy knowledge, saith the sage:
This Beast is he of whom t here spoke

The   prophets of the Golden Age:
'Mark! all t hat mind is, he is not.'
Sir Palamede in bitt er rage

Stert  e up: Is this the fool, 'Od wot,
To see t he like of whom I came
From castellated Camelot ?

The   sage with eyes of burning flame
Cried: Is it not a miracle?
Ay! for with folly t ravellet h shame, {31}

And   thereto at t he end is Hell
Believe! And why believe?Because
It is a thing impossible.

Sir  Palamede his pulses pause.
It is not possible (quod he)
That Palamede is wroth, and draws

His   sword, decapitating t hee.
By parity of argument
This deed of blood must surely be.

With    that he suddenly besprent
All Scythia with the sage's blood,
And laughting in his woe he went

Unto    a furt her field and flood,
Aye guided by t hat wizard's head,
That like a windy moon did scud

Before   him, winking eyes of red
And snapping j aws of whit e: but t hen
What cared for living or for dead

6IR  PALAMEDE the Saracen
Follows the Head to gloomy halls
Of sterile hate, with icy walls.
A woman clucking like a hen
Answers his lordly bugle-calls.

She  rees him in ungainly rede
Of ghosts and virgins, doves and wombs,
Of roods and prophecies and tombs -
Old pagan fables run to seed!
Sir Palamede with fury fumes.

So  doth the Head t hat j abbers fast
Against that woman's tangled tale.
(God's patience at t he end must fail!)
Out sweeps the sword - t he blade hath passed
Through all her scraggy farthingale.

This  chatter lends to Thought a zest
(Quod he), but I am all for Act.
Sit here, until your Talk hath cracked
The addled egg in Nature's nest!
With that he fled t he dismal tract . {33}

He   was so sick and ill at ease
And hot against his fellow men,
He t hought to end his purpose then -
Nay! let him seek new lands and seas,
Sir Palamede the Saracen!

{34}



                              ;,,,
6IR  PALAMEDE is come anon
Into a blue delicious bay.
A mountain towers t hereupon,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Wherein some fiend of ages gone

Is whelmed by God, yet from his breast
Spits up t he flame, and ashes grey.
Hereby Sir Palamede his quest
Pursues withouten let or rest.

Seeing   t he evil mountain be,
Remembering all his evil years,
He knows the Questing Beast runs free -
Author of Evil, then, is he!

Whereat     immediate resounds
The noise he hat h sought so long: appears
There quest a thirty couple hounds
Within its belly as it bounds.

Lifting  his eyes, he sees at last
The beast he seeks: 'tis like an hart.
Ever it courset h far and fast.
Sir Palamede is sore aghast, {35}

But   plucking up his will, doth launch
A might poison-dipp&#138;d dart :
It fareth ever sure and staunch,
And smitet h him upon t he haunch.

Then   as Sir Palamede overhauls
The st ricken quarry, slack it droops,
Staggers, and final down it falls.
Triumph! Gape wide, ye golden walls!

Lift  up your everlasting doors,
O gates of Camelot! See, he swoops
Down on the prey! The life-blood pours:
The poison works: t he breath implores

Its livelong debt from heart and brain.
Alas! poor stag, t hy day is done!
The gallant lungs gasp loud in vain:
Thy life is spilt upon t he plain.

Sir  Palamede is stricken numb
As one who, gazing on the sun,
Sees blackness gather. Blank and dumb,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The good knight sees a thin breath come

Out   of his proper mouth, and dart
Over t he plain: he seeth it
Sure by some black magician art
Shape ever closer like an hart: {36}

While   such a questing there resounds
As God had loosed t he very Pit,
Or as a thirty couple hounds
Are in its belly as it bounds!

Full  sick at heart, I ween, was then
The loyal knight , the weak of wit,
The but t of lewd and puny men,
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {37}



                                ;,9
1ORTHWARD        t he good knight gallops fast,
Resolved to seek his foe at home,
When rose t hat Vision of the past,
The royal battlements of Rome,
A ruined city, and a dome.

There   in t he broken Forum sat
A red-robed robber in a Hat.
Whither away, Sir Knight , so fey?
Priest, for the dove on Ararat
I could not , nor I will not, stay!

I know  thy quest . Seek on in vain
A golden hart with silver horns!
Life springeth out of divers pains.
What crown the King of Kings adorns?
A crown of gems?A crown of thorns!

The   Questing Beast is like a king
In face, and hat h a pigeon's wing
And claw; its body is one fleece
Of bloody white, a lamb's in spring.
Enough. Sir Knight, I give t hee peace. {38}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The   Knight spurs on, and soon espies
A monster coursing on the plain.
he hears t he horrid questing rise
And t hunder in his weary brain.
This time, to slay it or be slain!

Too   easy task! The charger gains
Stride after stride with litt le pains
Upon the lumbering, flapping thing.
He stabs t he lamb, and splits the brains
Of that maj estic-seeming king.

He   clips the wing and pares the claw -
What turns to laughter all his j oy,
To wondering ribaldry his awe?
The beast's a mere mechanic toy,
Fit to amuse an idle boy! {39}



                                 ;9
6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen
Hath come to an umbrageous land
Where nymphs abide, and Pagan men.
The Gods are nigh, say they, at hand.
How warm a throb from Venus stirs
The pulses of her worshippers!

Nor  shall t he Tuscan God be found
Reluctant from t he altar-st one:
His perfume shall delight t he ground,
His presence to his hold be known
In darkling grove and glimmering shrine -
O ply the kiss and pour t he wine!

Sir  Palamede is fairly come
Into a place of glowing bowers,
Where all t he Voice of Time is dumb:
Before an altar crowned with flowers
He seeth a satyr fondly dot e
And languish on a swan-soft goat.

Then   he in mid-caress desires
The ear of strong Sir Palamede. {40}
We burn, qouth he, no futile fires,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Nor play upon an idle reed,
Nor penance vain, nor fat uous prayers -
The Gods are ours, and we are theirs.

Sir Palamedes plucks t he pipe
The satyr tends, and blows a trill
So soft and warm, so red and ripe,
That echo answers from the hill
In eager and voluptuous strain,
While grows upon the sounding plain

Agallop,    and a questing t urned
To one profound melodious bay.
Sir Palamede with pleasure burned,
And bowed him to the idol grey
That on t he altar sneered and leered
With loose red lips behind his beard.

Sir Palamedes and t he Beast
Are woven in a web of gold
Until t he gilding of the East
Burns on the wanton-smiling wold:
And still Sir Palamede believed
His holy quest to be achieved!

But  now t he dawn from glowing gates
Floods all t he land: wit h snarling lip
The Beast stands off and cachinnat es.
That stings the good knight like a whip, {41}
As suddenly Hell's own disgust
Eats up t he j oy he had of lust.

The   brutal glee his folly t ook
For holy j oy breaks down his brain.
Off bolts the Beast: the earth is shook
As out a questing roars again,
As if a thirty couple hounds
Are in its belly as it bounds!

The   peasants gather to deride
The knight : creation j oins in mirt h.
Ashamed and scorned on every side,
There gallops, hat eful to the earth,
The laughing-stock of beasts and men,
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {42}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                               ;9,
:HERE       shafts of moonlight splash t he vale,
Beside a stream there sits and strains
Sir Palamede, wit h passion pale,

And   haggard from his broken brains.
Yet eagerly he watches still
A mossy mound where dainty grains

Of  gilded corn their beaut y spill
To tempt the quarry to t he range
Of Palamede his archer skill.

All might he sits, wit h ardour strange
And hope new-fledged. A gambler born
Aye things the luck one day must change,

Though   sense and skill he laughs to scorn.
so now there rush a t housand rats
In sable silence on t he corn.

They   sport their square or shovel hats,
A squeaking, tooth-bare brotherhood,
Innumerable as summer gnats {43}

Buzzing  some streamlet t hrough a wood.
Sir Palamede grows mighty wroth,
And mutters maledictions rude,

Seeing  his quarry far and loth
And t hieves despoiling all t he bait.
Now, careless of the knight ly oath,

The   sun pours down his eastern gate.
The chase is over: see ye t hen,
Coursing afar, afoam at fate
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {44}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                ;9,,
6IR    PALAMEDE hat h told t he tale
Of this misfortune to a sage,
How all his vent ures nought avail,

And    all his hopes dissolve in rage.
Now by thine holy beard, quoth he,
And by thy venerable age

I charge   t hee this my riddle ree.
Then said that gent le eremite:
This task is easy unto me!

Know    then t he Questing Beast aright!
One is the Beast, the Questing one:
And one with one is two, Sir Knight !

Yet   these are one in t wo, and none
disj oins their substance (mark me well!),
Confounds t heir persons. Rightly run

Their   att ribut es: immeasurable,
Incomprehensibundable,
Unspeakable, inaudible, {45}

Intangible,   ingustable,
Insensitive to human smell,
Invariable, implacable,

Invincible,   insciable,
Irrationapsychicable,
Inequilegij urable,

Immamemimomummable.
Such is its nature: wit hout parts,
Places, or persons, plumes, or pell,

Having    nor lungs nor light s nor hearts,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
But two in one and one in t wo.
Be he accurs&#138;d that disparts

Them    now, or seemeth so to do!
Him will I pile t he curses on;
Him will I hand, or saw him through,

Or   burn with fire, who doubts upon
This doctrine, hotototon spells
The holy word otototon.

The   poor Sir Palamedes quells
His rising spleen; he doubt s his ears.
How may I catch the Beast?he yells.

The   smiling sage rebukes his fears:
'Tis easier t han all, Sir Knight!
By simple faith the Beast appears. {46}

By   simple faith, not heat hen might ,
Catch him, and thus achieve the quest !
Then quoth t hat melancholy wight:

I will believe! The hermit blessed
His convert : on t he horizon
Appears the Beast. To thee the rest!

He   cries, to urge t he good knight on.
But no! Sir Palamedes grips
The hermit by the woebegone

Bear   of him; then away he rips,
Wood as a maniac, to the West,
Where down the sun in splendour slips,

And    where the quarry of t he quest
Canters. They run like hippogriffs!
Like men pursued, or swine possessed,

Over   the dizzy Cretan cliffs
they smash. And lo! it comes to pass
He sees in no dim hieroglyphs,

In knowledge easy to amass,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
This hermit (while he drew his breath)
Once dead is like a mangy ass.

Bruised,   broken, but not bound to death,
He calls some passing fishermen
To bear him. Presently he saith: {47}

Bear   me to some remot est den
To Heal me of my ills immense;
For now hath neit her might nor sense
Sir Palamede the Saracen. {48}



                               ;9,,,
6IR   PALAMEDESfor a space
Deliberates on his rustic bed.
I lack t he quarry's awful pace


(Quod    he); my limbs are slack as lead.
So, as he gets his strength, he seeks
The castles where t he pennons red

Of  dawn illume t heir dreadful peaks.
There dragons stretch t heir horrid coils
Adown t he winding clefts and creeks:

From    hideous mouths t heir venom boils.
But Palamede t heir fury 'scapes,
Their malice by his valour foils,

Climbing    aloft by bays and capes
Of rock and ice, encounters oft
The loathly sprit es, t he misty shapes

Of  monster brutes that lurk aloft.
O! well he works: his youth ret urns
His heart revives: despair is doffed {49}

And   eager hope in brilliance burns
Within the circle of his brows
As fast he flies, the snow he spurns.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Ah!   what a youth and strength he vows
To the achievement of the quest !
And now the horrid height allows

His   mastery: day by day from crest
To crest he hastens: faster fly
His feet: his body knows not rest,

Until  wit h magic speed t hey ply
Like oars the snowy waves, surpass
In one day's march t he galaxy

Of   Europe's starry mountain mass.
Now, quoth he, let me find the quest!
The Beast stert e up. Sir Knight, Alas!

Day   after day t hey race, nor rest
Till seven days were fairly done.
Then dot h the Questing Marvel crest

The   ridge: the knight is well outrun.
Now, adding laughter to its din,
Like some lewd comet at t he sun,

Around    t he panting paladin
It runs with all its splendid speed.
Yet , knowing t hat he may not win, {50}

He   strains and strives in very deed,
So that at last a boulder t rips
The hero, t hat he bursts a-bleed,

And   sanguine from his bearded lips
The torrent of his being breaks.
The Beast is gone: the hero slips

Down    to the valley: he forsakes
The fond idea (every bone
In all his body burns and aches)

By   speed to attain the dear Unknown,
By force to achieve t he great Beyond.
Yet from t hat brain may spring full-grown

7HE     knight hath found a naked girl
Among the dunes of Breton sand.
She spinneth in a mystic whirl,

And    hath a bagpipe in her hand,
Wherefrom she drawet h dismal groans
The while her maddening saraband

She   plies, and with discordant tones
Desires a certain devil-grace.
She gathers wreckage-wood, and bones

Of   seamen, j etsam of the place,
And builds therewith a fire, wherein
She dances, bounding into space

Like   an inflat ed ass's skin.
She raves, and reels, and yells, and whirls
So that the tears of toil begin

To   dew her breasts with ardent pearls.
Nor doth she mitigate her dance,
The bagpipe ever louder skirls, {52}

Until   t he shapes of death advance
And gather round her, shrieking loud
And wailing o'er the wide expanse

Of   sand, t he gibbering, mewing crowd.
Like cats, and apes, t hey gather close,
Till, like t he horror of a cloud

Wrapping      t he flaming sun with rose,
They hide her from the hero's sight.
Then dot h he must thereat morose,

When      in one wild cascade of light
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The pageant breaks, and t hunder roars:
Down flaps t he loathly wing of night.

He   sees t he lonely Breton shores
Lapped in t he levin: t hen his eyes
See how she shrieking soars and soars

Into  the starless, stormy skies.
Well! well! this lesson will he learn,
How music's mellowing artifice

May    bid t he breast of nature burn
And call the gods from star and shrine.
So now his sounding courses turn

To   find an instrument divine
Whereon he may pursue his quest .
How glitter green his gleeful eyne {53}

When,     where t he mice and lice infest
A filthy hovel, lies a wench
Bearing a baby at her breast,

Drunk    and debauched, one solid stench,
But carrying a silver lute.
'Boardet h her, nor dot h baulk nor blench,

And   long abidet h brut e by brute
Amid the unsavoury denzens,
Until his melodies uproot

The   oaks, lure lions from their dens,
Turn rivers back,and still t he spleen
Of serpents and of Saracens.

Thus   t hen equipped, he quits the quean,
And in a city fair and wide
Calls up with music wild and keen

The   Questing Marvel to his side.
Then do t he sportful city folk
About his lonely stance abide:

Making    their holiday, t hey j oke

But never comes t he Questing Beast,
Nor doth t hat laughing people know {54}

How    agony's unleavening yeast
Stirs Palamede. Anon t hey tire,
And follow an Egyptian priest

Who     boasts him master of the fire
To draw down lightning, and invoke
The gods upon a sandal pyre,

And   bring up devils in t he smoke.

Wrapped in his misery like a cloak,

Despairing     now to charm the Unknown.
So arms and horse he takes again.
Sir Palamede hath overt hrown

The   j esters. Now t he country men,
Stupidly staring, see at noon
Sir Palamede the Saracen

A-riding   like an harvest moon
In silver arms, with glitt ering lance,
With plum&#138;d helm, and wing&#138;d shoon,
Athwart t he admiring land of France. {55}

Beyond the shadow of a doubt
That this his Questing Beast is one;
For were it Beasts, he must suppose
An earlier Beast to father t hose.
So all t he t racks of herds t hat run

Into  the forest he discards,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And only t urns his dark regards
On single prints, on marks unique.
Sir Palamede doth now att ain
Unto a wide and grassy plain,
Whereon he spies the thing to seek.

Thereat    he putteth spur t o horse
And runneth him a random course,
The Beast a-questing aye before.
But praise to good Sir Palamede!
'Hath gotten him a fairy steed
Alike for venery and for war,

So  that in litt le drawing near

To run him of his malice t hrough. {56}
With that t he Beast hopes no escape,

Until t he baffled warrior sees
A myriad myriad swarms of these
A-questing over all the plain.

The   good knight reins his charger in.

And   run upon a beast: but they Slip from the fatal point away
And course about , confusing all

And in the moonlight mystical

Thus   reasons he: In each and all

So studying each twisted print
In this mirific mind of mine,

My   heart may happen on a hint.
Thus as t he seeker after gold
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Eagerly chases grain or glint, {61}

The   knight at last wins to behold
The full conception. Breathless-blue
The fair lake's mirror cryst al-cold

Wherein     he gazes, keen t o view
The vast Design therein, to chase
The Beast to his last avenue.

Then   - O thou gosling scant of grace!
The dream breaks, and Sir Palamede
Wakes to the glass of his fool's face!

Ah,  'sdeath! (quod he), by thought and deed
This brute for ever mocket h me.
The lance is made a broken reed,

The   brain is but a barren tree -
For all t he beautiful Design
Is but mine own geomet ry!

With   that his wrat h brake out like wine.
He plunged his body in, and shattered
The whole delusion asinine.

All the false wat er-nymphs that flattered
He killed with his resounding curse -
O fool of God! as if it mattered!

So, nothing better, rather worse,
Out of the blue bliss of the pool
Came dripping t hat invet erate fool! {62}



                               ;;,,,

So grand a Beast must house him well;
hence, now beseemeth me frequent
Cathedral, palace, citadel.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
So,  riding fast among t he flowers
Far off, a Gothic spire he spies,
That like a gladiator towers
Its spear-sharp splendour t o the skies.

The   people cluster round, acclaim:
Sir Knight , good knight , t hy quest is won.
Here dwells the Beast in orient flame,
Spring-sweet , and swifter t han t he sun!

Sir Palamede the Saracen
Spurs to t he shrine, afire t o win
The end; and all the urgent men
Throng with him eloquent ly in.

Sir Palamede his vizor drops;
He lays his loyal lance in rest;
He drives the rowels home - he stops!
Faugh! but a black-mout hed money-chest ! {63}

He   turns - the friendly folk are gone,
gone with his sumpt er-mules and t rain
Beyond the infinite horizon
Of all he hopes to see again!

His  brain befooled, his pocket picked -
How the Beast cachinnat ed then,
Far from that doleful derelict
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {64}



;;,9
2NE     thing at least (quoth Palamede),
Beyond disput e my soul can see:
This Questing Beast t hat mocks my need
Dwellet h in deep obscurity.

So  delveth he a darksome hole
Within the bowels of Et na dense,
Closing the harbour of his soul
To all t he pirate-ships of sense.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And   now t he questing of the Beast
Rolls in his very self, and high
Leaps his while heart in fiery feast
On the expect ed ecstasy.

But  echoing from t he cent ral roar
Reverberates many a mournful moan,
And shapes more mystic t han before
Baffle its formless monotone!

Ah!  mocks him many a myriad vision,
Warring within him masterless,
Turning devotion to derision,
Beatitude to beastliness. {65}

They   swarm, t hey grow, t hey multiply;
The Strong knight's brain goes all a-swim,
Paced by t hat maddening minstrelsy,
Those dog-like demons hunting him.

The   last bar breaks; the steel will snaps;
The black hordes riot in his brain;
A thousand threatening t hunder-claps
Smite him - insane - insane - insane!

His  muscles roar with senseless rage;
The pale knight staggers, deathly sick;
Reels to the light that sorry sage,
Sir Palamede the Lunatick. {66}

$SAVAGE      sea wit hout a sail,
Grey gulphs and green a-glittering,
Rare snow that floats - a vestal veil
Upon the forehead of the spring.

Here   in a plunging galleon
Sir Palamede, a listless drone,
Drifts desperately on - and on -
And on - wit h heart and eyes of stone.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The   deep-scarred brain of him is healed
With wind and sea and star and sun,
The assoiling grace that God revealed
For gree and bount eous benison.

Ah!   still he trusts the recreant brain,
Thrown in a t housand tourney-j usts;
Still he raves on in reason-strain
With senseless oughts and fatuous musts.

All  the delusions (arguet h
The ass), all uproars, surely rise
From that curst Me whose name is Deat h,
Whereas the Questing beast belies {67}

The   Me with Thou; t hen swift the quest
To slay the Me should hook the Thou.
With that he crossed him, brow and breast,
And flung his body from the prow.

An   end?Alas! on silver sand
Open his eyes; t he surf-rings roar.
What snorts there, swimming from the land?
The Beast that brought him to the shore!

OBeast!     quoth purple Palamede,
A monster st range as Thou am I.
I could not live before, indeed;
And not I cannot even die!

Who    chose me, of t he Table Round
By miracle acclaimed the chief?
Here, waterlogged and muscle-bound,
Marooned upon a coral reef! {68}

Paddled by stalwart Sout h Sea men.

That  slayet h all men wit h his eye,
Stands up before t hem tapering
The cone of speechless sanctity.

Up,   up its slopes the pilgrims swing,
Chanting t heir pagan gramarye
Unto the dread volcano-king.

Behold t he secret of my quest
In this far-famed stability! {69}

Engulphing all t hat heathen crew,

Aghast he standet h, Palamede!
For twinned with Eart hquake laughs her brother

The   Questing Beast. As Goddes reed
Sweats blood for sin, so now the heart
Of the good knight begins t o bleed.

Of  all t he ruinous shafts that dart
Within his liver, this hat h plied
The most intolerable smart .

By  Goddes wounds! t he good knight cried,
What is this quest, grown daily dafter,
Where not hing - not hing - may abide?

6IR   PALAMEDE goes aching on
(Pox of despair's dread int erdict!)
Aye to the west ern horizon,

Still meditating, sharp and strict,
Upon the changes of the earth,
Its towers and t emples derelict ,

The   ready ruin of its mirth,
The flowers, the fruits, t he leaves t hat fall,
The j oy of life, its growing girth -

And   nothing as the end of all.
Yea, even as the Yang-tze rolled
Its rapids past him, so the wall

Of   things brake down; his eyes behold
The mighty Beast serenely couched
Upon its breast of burnished gold.

Ah!   by Christ's blood! (his soul avouched),
Nothing but change (but change!) abides.
Death lurks, a leopard curled and crouched, {71}

In all t he seasons and t he tides.
But ah! the more it changed and changed -
(The good knight laughed t o split his sides!)

What?    Is t he soul of things deranged?
The more it changed, and rippled t hrough
Its changes, and still changed, and changed,

The   liker to itself it grew.
Bear me, he cried, to purge my bile
To the old land of Hormakhu,

At all t hese follies fond t hat pen

As Palamede t he Saracen. {72}

6IR   PALAMEDE the Saracen
Hath clad him in a sable robe;
Hath curses, writ by holy men
From all t he gardens of the globe.

He   standeth at an altar-st one;
The blood drips from the slain babe's throat ;
His chant rolls in a magick moan;
His head bows to the crown&#138;d goat.

His  wand makes curves and spires in air;
The smoke of incense curls and quivers;
His eyes fix in a glass-cold stare:
The land of Egypt rocks and shivers!

Lo!  by t hy Gods, O God, I vow
To burn t he authentic bones and blood
Of curst Osiris even now
To the dark Nile's upsurging flood!

I cast thee down, oh crowned and t hroned!
To black Amennti's void profane.
Until mine anger be atoned
Thou shalt not ever rise again. {73}

With    firm red lips and square black beard,
Osiris in his strengt h appeared.

He   made the sign that saveth men
On Palamede t he Saracen.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
'
Hath    hushed his conj uration grim:
The curse comes back to sleep wit h him.


'
Hath    fallen himself to that profane
Whence none might ever rise again.

Dread    tort ure racks him; all his bones
Get voice to utter forth his groans.

The   very poison of his blood
Joins in that cry's soul-shaking flood.

For   many a chiliad counted well
His soul stayed in its proper Hell.

Then,   when Sir Palamedes came
Back to himself, t he shrine was dark.
Cold was the incense, dead the flame;
The slain babe lay there black and stark.

What    of the Beast?What of the quest ?
More blind the quest , the Beast more dim.
Even now its laughter is suppressed,
While his own demons mock at him! {74}

O thou    most desperate dupe that Hell's
Malice can make of mortal men!
Meddle no more with magick spells,
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {75}



                               ;;,;
+A!    but the good knight , striding forth
From Set's abominable shrine,
Pursues t he quest with bitt er wrat h,
So that his words flow out like wine.

And   lo! the soul t hat heareth t hem
Is straightway healed of suffering.
His fame runs through the land of Khem:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
They flock, the peasant and the king.

There    he works many a miracle:
The blind see, and the cripples walk;
Lepers grow clean; sick folk grow well;
The deaf men hear, t he dumb men talk.

He   casts out devils with a word;
Circlet h his wand, and dead men rise.
No such a wonder hat h been heard
Since Christ our God's sweet sacrifice.

Now,    by the glad blood of our Lord!
Quoth Palamede, my heart is light.
I am the chosen harpsichord
Whereon God playet h; the perfect knight, {76}

The   saint of Mary - t here he stayed,
For out of Memnon's singing stone
So fierce a questing barked and brayed,
It turned his laught er to a groan.

His  vow forgot, his task undone,
His soul whipped in God's bitter school!
(He moaned a mighty malison!)
The perfect knight ?The perfect fool!

Now,    by God's wounds! quoth he, my st rength
Is burnt out to a pest of pains.
Let me fling off my curse at length
In old Chaldea's starry plains!

Thou   bless&#138;d Jesus, foully nailed
Unto the cruel Calvary t ree,
Look on my soul's poor fort assailed
By all t he hosts of devilry!

Is there no medicine but death
That shall avail me in my place,
That I may know the Beaut eous Breath
And taste t he Goodly Gift of Grace?

Keep   Thou yet firm t his trembling leaf
My soul, dear God Who died for men;
Yea! for that sinner-soul the chief,

6TARRED      is the blackness of the sky;
Wide is the sweep of the cold plain
Where good Sir Palamede doth lie,
Keen on the Beast-slot once again.

All  day he rode; all night he lay
With eyes wide open to t he stars,
Seeking in many a secret way
The key to unlock his prison bars.

Beneat   h him, hark! the marvel sounds!
The Beast that questet h horribly.
As if a thirty couple hounds
Are in his belly quest eth he.

Beneat   h him?Heareth he aright?
He leaps to'sfeet - a wonder shews:
Steep dips a stairway from the light
To what obscurity God knows.

Still never a tremor shakes his soul
(God praise thee, knight of adamant!);
He plungers to that gruesome goal
Firm as an old bull-elephant! {78}

The   broad stair winds; he follows it;
Dark is the way; the air is blind;
Black, black the blackness of the pit ,
The light long blotted out behind!

His  sword sweeps out ; his keen glance peers
For some shape glimmering through the gloom:
Naught , naught in all that void appears;
More still, more silent t han the tomb!

Ye   now the good knight is aware
Of some black force, of some dread t hrone,
Waiting beneath t hat awful stair,
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Beneath t hat pit of slippery stone.

Yea!   though he sees not anything,
Nor hears, his subtle sense is 'ware
That, lackeyed by t he devil-king,
The Beast - the Questing Beast - is there!

So  though his heart beats close with fear,
Though horror grips his throat, he goes,
Goes on to meet it, spear t o spear,
As good knight should, to face his foes.

Nay!   but t he end is come. Black earth
Belches t hat peerless Paladin
Up from her gulphs - untimely birth!
- Her horror could not hold him in! {79}

White    as a corpse, t he hero hails
The dawn, t hat night of fear still shaking
His body. All death's doubt assails
Him. Was it sleep or was it waking?

By  God, I care not , I! (quod he).
Or wake or sleep, or live or dead,
I will pursue this mystery.
So help me Grace of Godlihead!

Ay!   wit h thy wasted limbs pursue
That subtle Beast home to his den!
Who know but thou mayst win athrough,

Hath come unto a demon bog,
A city where but rats may breed

In sewer-stench and fetid fog.
Within its heart pale phant oms crawl.
Breathless with foolish haste they j og
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And   j ostle, all for naught! They scrawl
Vain things all night that t hey disown
Ere day. They call and bawl and squall

Hoarse    cries; they moan, they groan. A stone
Hath better sense! And these among
A cabbage-headed god t hey own,

With    wandering eye and j abbering tongue.
He, rotting in that grimy sewer
And charnel-house of deat h and dung,

Shrieks:   How t he air is sweet and pure!
Give me t he ent rails of a frog
And I will teach thee! Lo! t he lure {81}

Of  light! How lucent is t he fog!
How noble is my cabbage-head!
How sweet ly fragrant is the bog!

God's   wounds! (Sir Palamedes said),
What have I done to earn t his portion?
Must I, t he clean knight born and bred,

Sup  wit h this filt hy toad-abortion?
Nathless he stayed with him awhile,
Lest by disdain his mention torsion

Slip back, or miss the serene smile
Should crown his quest; for (as onesaith)
The unknown may lurk wit hin t he vile.

So he who sought t he Beauteous Breat h,
Desired t he Goodly Gift of Grace,
Went equal into life and death.

But  oh! the foulness of his face!
Not here was anyt hing of worth;
He t urned his back upon the place,

Sought   t he blue sky and t he green earth,
Ay! and the lustral sea to cleanse
That filt h that stank about his girth, {82}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The   sores and scabs, the warts and wens,
The nameless vermin he had gathered
In those insufferable dens,

The   foul diseases he had fathered.
So now the quest slips from his brain:
First (Christ!) let me be clean again! {83}

Of brain dissolve this cruel coil!
In Afric t hey that chase t he ostrich
Clothe t hem with feat hers, subtly foil

Its vigilance, come close, then dart
Its death upon it. Brave my heart !
Do thus! And so the knight disguises
Himself, on hands and knees doth start

His   hunt , goes questing up and down.
So in the fields t he peasant clown
Flies, shrieking, from t he dreadful figure.
But when he came to any t own

They     caged him for a lunatic.
Quod he: Would God I had the t rick!
The beast escaped from my devices;
I will t he same. The bars are t hick,

But   I am strong. He wrenched in vain;
Then - what is this?What wild, sharp st rain
Smites on the air?The prison smashes.
Hark! 'tis the Questing Beast again! {84}

Then     as he rushes forth the note
Roars from that Beast's malignant t hroat
With laughter, laughter, laughter, laughter!
The wits of Palamedes float

In ecstasy of shame and rage.
O Thou! exclaims the baffled sage;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
How should I match Thee?Yet , I will so,
Though Doomisday devour the Age.

Weeping,      and beating on his breast ,
Gnashing his teet h, he still confessed
The might of the dread oat h that bound him:
He would not yet give up t he quest.

Nay!    while I am, quoth he, though Hell
Engulph me, though God mock me well,
I follow as I sware; I follow,
Though it be unattainable.

Nay,    more! Because I may not win,
Is't worth man's work to enter in!
The Infinit e with mighty passion
Hath caught my spirit in a gin.

Come!     since I may not imitate
The Beast, at least I work and wait.
We shall discover soon or late
Which is the master - I or Fate! {85}

That the keen whisper of t he wind
May bring him that which never men
Knew - on t he quest, t he quest, rides he!
So long to seek, so far to find!

So   weary was the knight , his limbs
Were slack as new-slain dove's; his knees
No longer gripped the charger rude.
Listless, he aches; his purpose swims
Exhausted in t he oily seas
Of laxity and lassitude.

The    soul subsides; its serious motion
Still t hrobs; by habit , not by will.
And all his lust to win the quest
Is but a passive-mild devotion.
(Ay! soon the blood shall run right chill
_____________________________________________________________________________________
- And is not death t he Lord of Rest?)

There   as he basks upon t he cliff
He yearns toward the Beast; his eyes
Are moist with love; his lips are fain {86}
To breat he fond prayers; and (marry!) if
Man's soul were measured by his sighs
He need not linger to attain.

Nay!   while the Beast squats there, above
Him, smiling on him; as he vows
Wonderful deeds and fruitless flowers,
He grows so maudlin in his love
That even t he knaves of his own house
Mock at him in t heir merry hours.

God's   death! raged Palamede, not wroth
But irritated, laugh ye so?
Am I a j ape for scullions?
His curse came in a flaky froth.
He seized a club, with blow on blow
Breaking t he knave's unreverent sconce!

Thou   mock t he Questing Beast I chase,
The Questing Beast I love?'Od's wounds!
Then sudden from t he slave there brake
A cachinnation scant of grace,
As if a thirty couple hounds
Were in his belly! Knight, awake!

Ah!   well he woke! His love an scorn
Grapple in death-throe at his throat.
Lead me away (quoth he), my men!
Woe, woe is me was ever born
So blind a bat , so gross a goat,

Upon an island in the fen

Of   that lone land where Druids dwell.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
There came an eagle from the height
And bade him mount . From dale to dell

They   sank and soared. Last to the light
Of the great sun himself they flew,
Piercing the borders of the night,

Passing   the irremeable blue.
Far into space beyond the stars
At last they came. And t here he knew

All the blind reasonable bars
Broken, and all t he emotions stilled,
And all t he stains and all t he scars

Left  him; sop like a child he t hrilled
With utmost knowledge; all his soul,
With perfect sense and sight fulfilled, {88}

Touched    t he extreme, the giant goal!
Yea! all things in that hour transcended,
All power in his sublime control,

All felt, all t hought, all comprehended -
How is it, then, the quest (he saith)
Is not - at last! - achieved and ended?

Why    taste I not the Bount eous Breath,
Receive the Goodly Gift of Grace?
Now, kind king-eagle (by God's deat h!),

Restore   me to mine ancient place!
I am advantaged nothing t hen!
Then swooped he from t he Byss of Space,

And   set the knight amid t he fen.

Who have won nine should fail at ten!

For were I keener t han t he lynx

I should  not see within my mind
One t hought that is not in its kind
In sooth That Beast that lurks behind:

And   in my quest his questing seems
The authentic echo of my dreams,
The proper t hesis of my themes!

I know him?Still he answers: No!
I know him not?Maybe - and lo!
He is the one sole t hing I know!

Nay!   who knows not is different
From him that knows. Then be cont ent ;
Thou canst not alter the event ! {90}

Ah!  what conclusion subtly draws
From out this chaos of mad laws?
An I, the effect, as I, the cause?

Nay,   the brain reels beneath its swell
Of pompous t houghts. Enough to tell
That He is known Unknowable!

Thus   did that knight ly Saracen
In Cantabrig's miasmal fen
Lecture to many learned men.

So  clamorous was their applause -
His mind (said they) is free of flaws:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The Veil of God is thin as gauze! -

That   almost they had dulled or drowned
The laughter (in its belly bound)
Of that dread Beast he had not found.

Nathless    - although he would away -
They forced the lack-luck knight to stay
And lecture many a weary day.

Verily,   almost he had caught
The infection of t heir costive thought,
And brought his loyal quest to naught .

It was by night t hat Palamede
Ran from t hat mildewed, mouldy breed,
Moth-eat hen dullards run t o seed! {91}

How    weak Sir Palamedes grows!

Proven in many a foughten fight,
Flees like a felon in the night!

2FT,     as Sir Palamedes went
Upon the quest , he was aware
Of some vast shadow subtly bent
With his own shadow in the air.

It had no shape, no voice had it
Wherewith to daunt the eye or ear;
Yet all t he horror of the pit
Clad it with all t he arms of fear.

Moreover,    t hough he sought to scan
Some feature, though he listened long,
No shape of God or fiend or man,
No whisper, groan, shriek, scream, or song

Gave   him to know it. Now it chanced
One day Sir Palamedes rode
Through a great wood whose leafage danced
In the t hin sunlight as it flowed

From   heaven. He halt ed in a glade,
Bade his horse crop t he t ender grass;
Put off his armour, softly laid
Himself to sleep till noon should pass. {93}

He  woke. Before him stands and grins
A motley hunchback. Knave! quoth he,
Hast seen the Beast?The quest that wins
The loftiest prize of chivalry?

Sir Knight , he answers, hast thou seen
Aught of that Beast?How knowest thou, t hen,
That it is ever or hat h been,
Sir Palamede the Saracen?

Sir Palamede was well awake.
Nay! I deliberate deep and long,
Yet find no answer fit to make
To thee. The weak beats down the strong;

The   fool's cap shames t he helm. But t hou!
I know thee for t he shade t hat haunts
My way, sets shame upon my brow,
My purpose dims, my courage daunts.

Then,    since t he t hinker must be dumb,
At least t he knight may knightly act :
The wisest monk in Christendom
May have his skull broke by a fact.

With   that, as a snake strikes, his sword
Leapt burning to t he burning blue;
And fell, one swift, assured award,
Stabbing t hat hunchback t hrough and through. {94}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Straight  he dissolved, a voiceless shade.
Or scotched or slain, the knight said then,
What odds?Keep bright and sharp thy blade,
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {95}



                             ;;;9,,
6IR   PALAMEDE is sick to death!
The staring eyen, t he haggard face!
God grant to him the Beauteous breath!
god send t he Goodly Gift of Grace!

There   is a white cave by t he sea
Wherein t he knight is hid away.
Just ere the night falls, spieth he
The sun's last shaft flicker astray.

All  day is dark. There, t here he mourns
His wasted years, his purpose faint.
A million whips, a million scorns
Make the knight flinch, and stain the saint.

For  now! what hath he left?He feeds
On limpets and wild roots. What odds?
There is no need a mortal needs
Who hath loosed man's hope to grasp at God's!

How    his head swims! At night what stirs
Above the faint wash of the tide,
And rare sea-birds whose winging whirrs
About t he cliffs?Now good betide! {96}

God   save thee, woeful Palamede!
The questing of the Beast is loud
Within thy ear. By Goddes reed,
thou has won the tilt from all t he crowd!

Within   thy proper bowels it sounds
Mighty and musical at need,
As if a thirty couple hounds
Quest ed within thee, Palamede!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Now,    then, he grasps the desperate t rut h
He hath toiled t hese many years to see,
Hath wasted strength, hat h wasted youth -0-
He was the Beast ; the Beast was he!

He   rises from t he cave of death,
Runs to the sea with shining face
To know at last the Bounteous Breath,
To taste the Goodly Gift of Grace.

Ah!   Palamede, thou has mistook!
Thou art the butt of all confusion!
Not to be writt en in my book
Is this most drastic disillusion!

So  weak and ill was he, I doubt
if he might hear the royal feast
Of laught er t hat came rolling out
Afar from that elusive Beast. {97}

Yet,   those white lips were snapped, like steel
Upon the ankles of a slave!
That body broken on the wheel
Of time suppressed t he groan it gave!

Not   there, not here, my quest! he cried.
Not thus! Not now! do how and when
Matter?I am, and I abide,
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {98}



                            ;;;9,,,
6IR   PALAMEDE of great renown
rode t hrough the land upon the quest ,
His sword loose and his vizor down,
His buckler braced, his lance in rest.

Now,    then, God save t hee, Palamede!
Who courseth yonder on t he field?
Those silver arms, that sable steed,
The sun and rose upon his shield?
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The   strange knight spurs t o him. disdain
Curls t hat proud lip as he uplifts
His vizor. Come, an end! In vain,
Sir Fox, thy t housand turns and shifts!

Sir Palamede was white with fear.
Lord Christ! those features were his own;
His own that voice so icy clear
That cuts him, cuts him to the bone.

False   knight ! false knight ! the stranger cried.
Thou bastard dog, Sir Palamede?
I am the good knight fain t o ride
Upon the Questing Beast at need. {99}

Thief   of my arms, my crest, my quest,
My name, now meetest thou thy shame.
See, with t his whip I lash t hee back,
Back to the kennel whence there came

So  false a hound. Good knight, in sooth,
Answered Sir Palamede, not I
Presume to asset t he idlest trut h;
And here, by t his good ear and eye,

I grant  thou art Sir Palamede.
But - try t he first and final test
If thou or I be he. Take heed!
He backed his horse, covered his breast ,

Drove   his spurs home, and rode upon
That knight. His lance-head fairly struck
The barred st rength of his morion,
And rolled the stranger in t he muck.

Now,    by God's deat h! quoth Palamede,
His sword at work, I will not leave
So much of thee as God might feed
His sparrows with. As I believe

The   sweet Christ's mercy shall avail,
so will I not have aught for thee;
Since every bone of thee may rail
Against me, crying t reachery. {100}
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thou    hast lied. I am the chosen knight
To slay the Questing beast for men;
I am the loyal son of light,
Sir Palamede the Saracen!

Thou   wast the subtlest fiend t hat yet
hath crossed my path. to say thee nay
I dare not, but my sword is wet
With thy knave's blood, and with t hy clay

Fouled!    Dost thou think to resurrect?
O sweet Lord Christ that savest men!
From all such fiends do thou prot ect
Me, Palamede the Saracen! {101}



                             ;;;,;
*REEN      and Grecian is the valley,
Shepherd lads and shepherd lasses
Dancing in a ring
Merrily and musically.
How their happiness surpasses
The mere t hrill of spring!

Come     (they cry), Sir Knight, put by
All t hat weight of shining armour!
Here's a posy, here's a garland, there's a chain of daisies!
Here's a charmer! There's a charmer!
Praise the God that crazes men, the God that raises
All our lives toe ecstasy!

Sir  Palamedes was too wise
To mock their gentle wooing;
He smiles into their sparkling eyes
While t hey his armour are undoing.
For who (quoth he) may say that this
Is not the mystery I miss?

Soon   he is gathered in t he dance,
And smothered in the flowers. {102}
A boy's laugh and a maiden's glance
Are sweet as paramours!
Stay! is thee naught some wanton wight
_____________________________________________________________________________________
May do to excite t he glamoured knight?

Yea!   the song takes a sea-wild swell;
The dance moves in a mystic web;
Strange lights abound and terrible;
The life t hat flowed is out at ebb.

The   lights are gone; the night is come;
The lads and lasses sink, awaiting
Some climax - oh, how t ense and dumb
The expectant hush intoxicating!
Hush! t he heart 's beat ! Across the moor
Some dreadful god rides fast, be sure!

The   listening Palamede bites through
his thin white lips - what hoofs are those?
Are t hey t he Quest?How still and blue
The sky is! Hush - God knows - God knows!

Then    on a sudden in the midst of them
is a swart god, from hoof to girdle a goat,
Upon his brow the twelve-star diadem
And t he King's Collar fastened on this t hroat.

Thrill  upon t hrill courseth through Palamede.
Life, live, pure life is bubbling in his blood.
All youth comes back, all strengt h, all you indeed
Flaming within t hat throbbing spirit-flood! {103
Yet was his heart immeasurably sad,
For that no questing in his ear he had.

Nay!   he saw all. He saw t he Curse
That wrapped in ruin the World primaeval.
He saw the unborn Universe,
And all its gods coeval.
He saw, and was, all things at once
In Him t hat is; he was the stars,
The moons, t he meteors, t he suns,
All in one net of triune bars;
Inextricably one, inevitably one,
Immeasurable, immutable, immense
Beyond all the wonder t hat his soul had won
By sense, in spite of sense, and beyond sense.
Praise God! quoth Palamede, by this
I attain the utt ermost of bliss. ...

God's   wounds! but that I never sought.
The Questing Beast I sware to attain
_____________________________________________________________________________________
And all t his miracle is naught.
Off on my travels once again!

I keep my yout h regained to foil
Old Time t hat took me in his toil.
I keep my strengt h regained to chase
The beast t hat mocks me now as then
Dear Christ! I pray Thee of Thy grace
Take pity on the forlorn case
Of Palamede t he Saracen! {104}



                                ;/

SIR  PALAMEDE the Saracen
Hath see the All; his mind is set
To pass beyond that great Amen.

Far  hath he wandered; still to fret
His soul against that Soul. He breaches
The rhododendron forest -net,

His  body bloody with its leeches.
Sternly he t ravelleth t he crest
Of a great mountain, far that reaches

Toward    the King-snows; t he rains molest
The knight , whit e wastes updriven of wind
In sheets, in torrents, fiend-possessed,

Up  from t he steaming plains of Ind.
They cut his flesh, they chill his bones:
Yet he feels naught; his mind is pinned

To  that one point where all t he t hrones
Join to one lion-head of rock,
Towering above all crests and cones {105}

That  crouch like j ackals. Stress and shock
Move Palamede no more. Like fate
He moves with silent speed. They flock,

The   Gods, to watch him. Now abate
_____________________________________________________________________________________
His pulses; he t hreads through t he vale,
And t urns him to t he might y gate,

The   glacier. Oh, t he flowers that scale
those sun-kissed heights! The snows t hat crown
The quarts ravines! The clouds that veil

The   awful slopes! Dear God! look down
And see t his petty man move on.
Relentless as Thine own renown,

Careless   of praise or orison,
Simply det ermined. Wilt thou launch
(this knight's presumptuous head upon)

The   devastating avalancehe?
He knows too much, and cares too little!
His wound is more t han Death can staunch.

He   can avoid, though by one titt le,
Thy surest shaft ! And now the knight,
Breasting the crags, may laugh and whitt le

Away    the demon-club whose might
Threatened him. Now he leaves the spur;
And eager, with a boy's delight, {106}

Treads   t he impending glacier.
Now, now he strikes the steep black ice
That leads to the last neck. By Her

That   bore the lord, by what device
May he pass there?Yet still he moves,
Ardent and steady, as if the price

Of   death were less than life approves,
As if on eagles' wings he mounted,
Or as on angels' wings - or love's!

So,  all the j ourney he discounted,
Holding the goal. Supreme he stood
Upon the summit; dreams uncount ed,

Worlds    of sublime beatitude!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
He passed beyond. The All he hath touched,
And dropped to vile desuet ude.

What     lay beyond?What st ar unsmutched
By being?His poor fingers fumble,
And all t he Naught t heir ardour clutched,

Like   all t he rest , begins to crumble.
Where is the Beast?His bliss exceeded
All t hat bards sing of or priests mumble;

No    man, no God, hath known what he did.
Only this baulked him - t hat he lacked
Exactly t he one t hing he needed. {107}

Faugh!    cried the knight . Thought , word, and act
Confirm me. I have proved the quest
Impossible. I break the pact.

Back   to the gilded halls, confessed
A recreant! Achieved or not,
This task hath earned a foison - rest.

In Caerlon and Camelot
Let me embrace my fellow-men!
To buss the wenches, pass the pot,
Is now the enviable lot
Of Palamede t he Saracen! {108}



                                  ;/,
6IR   ARTHUR sits again at feast
Within the high and holy hall
Of Camelot. From West to East

The    Table Round hat h burst the t hrall
Of Paynimrie. The goodliest gree
Sits on the gay knights, one and all;

Till  Arthur: Of your chivalry,
Knights, let us drink t he happiness
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Of the one knight we lack (quoth he);

For   surely in some sore distress
May be Sir Palamede. Then they
Rose as one man in glad liesse

To   honour that great health. god's way
Is not as man's (quot h Lancelot).
Yet , may god send him back this day,

His   quest achieve, to Camelot!
Amen! t hey cried, and raised t he bowl;
When - t he wind rose, a blast as hot {109}

As   the simoom, and fort h did roll
A sudden thunder. Still t hey stood.
Then came a bugle-blast. The soul

Of   each knight stirred. With vigour rude,
The blast tore down the tapestry
That hid the door. All ashen-hued

The   knights laid hand to sword. But he
(Sir Palamedes) in t he gap
Was found - God knoweth - bitterly

Weeping.     Cried Arthur: St range t he hap!
My knight , my dearest knight, my friend!
What gift had Fortune in her lap

Like   thee?Em,brace me! Rather end
Your garments, if you love me, sire!
(Quod he). I am come unto the end.

All  mine int ent and my desire,
My quest, mine oath - all, all is done.
Burn them with me in fatal fire!

Fir  I have failed. All ways, each one
I strove in, mocked me. If I quailed
Or shirked, God knows. I have not won:

That   and no more I know. I failed.
King Arthur fell a-weeping. Then
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Merlin uprose, his face unveiled; {110}

Thrice    cried he piteously then
Upon our Lord. Then shook this head
Sir Palamede the Saracen,

As   knowing not hing might bestead,
When lo! there rose a monster moan,
A hugeous cry, a questing dread,

As   if (God's deat h!) there coursed alone
The Beast, wit hin whose belly sounds
That marvellous music monotone

As   if a thirty couple hounds
Quest ed within him. Now, by Christ
And by His pitiful five wounds! -

Even    as a lover to his tryst,
That Beast came questing in the hall,
One flame of gold and amethyst,

Bodily   seen then of them all.
then came he to Sir Palamede,
Nestling to him, as sweet and small

As   a young babe clings at its need
To the white bosom of its mother,
As Christ clung to t he gibbet-reed!

Then    every knight turned to his brother,
Sobbing and signing for great gladness;
And, as they looked on one another, {111}

Surely   t here stole a subtle madness
Into their veins, more strong than deat h:
For all t he roots of sin and sadness

Were     plucked. As a flower perishet h,
So all sin died. And in that place
All t hey did know the Beauteous Breath

And    taste the Goodly Gift of Grace.
Then fell the night . Above the baying
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Of the great Beast , that was the bass

To   all t he harps of Heaven a-playing,
There came a solemn voice (not one
But was upon his knees in praying

And     glorifying God). The Son
Of God Himself - men thought - spoke then.
Arise! brave soldier, t hou hast won

The    quest not given to mortal men.
Arise! Sir Palamede Adept ,
Christian, and no more Saracen!

On    wake or sleeping, wise, inept ,
Still t hou didst seek. Those foolish ways
On which t hy folly stumbled, leapt ,

All  led to t he one goal. Now praise
Thy Lord hat He hat brought thee t hrough
To win the quest ! The good knight lays {112}

His   hand upon the Beast. Then blew
Each angel on his trumpet , then
All Heaven resounded that it knew

Sir  Palamede the Saracen
Was master! Through t he domes of death,
Through all t he mighty realms of men

And     spirits breathed t he Beauteous Breat h:
They taste the Goodly Gift of Grace.
- Now 'tis the chronicler that saith:

Our    Saviour grant in little space
That also I, even I, be blest
Thus, though so evil is my case -

Let   them that read my rime attest
The same sweet unction in my pen -
That writ es in pure blood of my breast;

For   that I figure unto men
The story of my proper quest
_____________________________________________________________________________________
As thine, first Eastern in t he West,
Sir Palamede the Saracen! {113}
