LIBER LI. THE LOST CONTINENT. An account of the Continent of
Atlantis: the manners and customs, magical rites and opinions of its
people, together with a true account of the catastrophe, so called,
which ended in its disappearance.

The Blue Equinox.

Numerous other poems, essays and short stories were written during
this summer [1913]. In particular there is a sort of novel, The Lost
Continent, purporting to give an account of the civilization of
Atlantis. I sometimes feels that this lacks artistic unity. At times it
is a fantastic rhapsody describing my ideals of Utopian society; but
some passages are a satire on the conditions of our existing
civilization, while others convey hints of certain profound magical
secrets, or anticipations of discoveries in science.

                           THE LOST CONTINENT

Last year I was chosen to succeed the venerable K---- Z---- who had it in his mind
to die, that is, to join Them in Venus, as one of the Seven Heirs of Atlantis, and I have
been appointed to declare, so far as may be found possible, the truth about that
mysterious lost land. Of course no more than one seventh of the wisdom is ever
confided to any one of the Seven, and the Seven meet in council but once in every
thirty-three years, but its preservation is guaranteed by the interlocked systems of
"dreaming true" and of "preparation by antimony." The former almost explains itself;
the latter is almost inconceivable to normal men. Its essence is to train a man to be
anything by training him to be its opposite. At the end of anything, think they, it turns
out to be its opposite, and that opposite is thus mastered without having been soiled by
the labours of the student, and without the false impressions of early learning left upon
his mind.

I myself, for example, had unknowingly been trained to record these observations by
the life of a butterfly. All my impressions come clear on the soft wax of my brain; I
had never worried because the scratch on the wax in no way resembled the sound it
represented. In other words, I observed perfectly because I never knew that I was
observing. So, if you pay sufficient attention to your heart, you will make it palpitate.

I accordingly proceed to a description of the country.

          OF THE PLAINS BENEATH ATLAS, AND THE SERVILE RACE*

Atlas is the true name of this archipelago--continent is an altogether false term, for
every "house" or mountain peak was cut from its fellows by natural, though often very
narrow, waterways. The African Atlas is a mere offshoot of the range. It was the true
Atlas that supported the ancient world by its moral and magical strength, and hence
the name of the fabled globe-bearer. The root is the Lemurian: Tla, or Tlas, black, for
reasons which will appear in due course. "A" is the feminine prefix, derived from the
shape of the mouth when uttering the sound. "Black woman" is therefore as near a
translation as one can give in English; the Latin has a closer equivalent.

The mountains are cut off, not only from each other by the channels of the sea, but
from the plains at their feet by cliffs natural or artificial smoothed and undercut for at
least thirty feet on every side, in order to make access impossible.

These plains had been made flat by generations of labour. Vines and fruit-trees
growing only on the upper slopes, they were devoted principally to corn, and to grass
pastures for the amphibian herds of Atlas. This corn was of a kind now unknown,
flourishing in sea-water, and the periodical flood-tides served the same purpose as the
Nile in Egypt. Enormous floating stages of spongy rock--no trees of any kind grew
anywhere on the plains, so wood was unknown--supported the villages. These were
inhabited by a type of man similar to the modern Caucasian race. They were not
permitted to use any of the food of their masters, neither the corn, nor the vast supplies
of shell-fish, but were fed by what they called "bread from heaven", which indeed
came down from the mountains, being the whole of their refuse of every kind. The
whole population was put to perpetual hard labour. The young and active tended the
amphibians, grew the corn, collected the shell-fish, gathered the "bread from heaven"
for their elders, and were compelled to reproduce their kind. At twenty they were
considered strong enough for the factory, where they worked in gangs on a machine
combining the features of our pump and treadmill for 16 hours of the twentyfour. This
machine supplied Atlas with its "ZRO" or `power', of which I shall speak presently.
Any worker showing even temporary weakness was transferred to the phosphorus
factory, where he was sure to die within a few months. Phosphorus was a prime
necessity of Atlas; however, it was not used in its red or yellow forms, but in a third
allotrope, a blue-black or rather violet-black substance, only known in powder finer
than precipitated gold, harder than diamond, eleven times heavier than yellow
phosphorus, quite incombustible, and so shockingly poisonous that, in spite of every
precaution, an ounce of it cost the lives (on an average) of some two hundred and fifty
men. Of its properties I shall speak later.

*There were four (some say five) distinct races, each having several sub-races. But the main
characteristics were the same. Some allege the Portuguese and the English to be survivals of
this or kindred stock.
  Or Zra'a. The ZR is drawled slowly; then the lips are suddenly curled back in a sneering
snarl, and the vowel sharply and forcibly uttered. It is disputed whether this word is connected
with the Sanskrit Sri, holy.

                                THE LOST CONTINENT

The people were left in utmost slavery and ignorance by the wise counsel of the first
of the philosophers of Atlas, who had written: An empty brain is a threat to Society.
He had consequently instituted a system of mental culture, comprising two parts:

    1.   As basis, a mass of useless disconnected facts.
    2.   A superstructure of lies.

Part 1 was compulsory; the people then took Part 2 without protest.* The language of
the plains was simple but profuse. They had few nouns and fewer verbs. "To work
again" (there was no word for "to work" simply), "to sleep again", "to eat again", "to
break the law" (no word for "to break the law again"), "to come from without", "to
find light" (i.e. to go to the phosphorus factory) were almost the only verbs used by
adults. The young men and women had a verb-language yet simpler, and of degraded
coarseness. All had, however, an extraordinary wealth of adjectives, most of them
meaningless, as attached to no noun ideas, and a great quantity of abstract nouns such
as "Liberty", "Progress", without which no refined inhabitant would consider a
sentence complete. He would introduce them into a discussion on the most material
subjects.   "The immoral snub-nose", "unprogressive teeth", "lascivious music",
"reactionary eyebrows"--such were phrases familiar to all. "To eat again, to sleep
again, to work again, to find the light--that is Liberty, that is Progress" was a proverb
common in every mouth.

The religion of the people was Protestant Christianity in all essentials, but with an
even closer dependence upon God. They asserted its formulæ, without attaching any
meaning to the words, in a manner both reverent and passionate. Sexual life was
entirely forbidden to the workers, a single breach implying relegation to the
phosphorus works.

In every field was (however) an enormous tablet of rock, carved on one side with a
representation of the three stages of life: the fields, the labour mill, the phosphorus
factory; and on the other side with these words: To enter Atlas, fly. Beneath this an
elaborate series of graphic pictures showed how to acquire the art of flying. During all
the generations of Atlas, not one man had been known to take advantage of these
instructions.

The principal fear of the populace was a variation of any kind from routine. For any
such the people had one word only, though this word changed is annoation in different
centuries. "Witchraft", "Heresy", "Madness", "Bad form", "Sex-perversion", "Black
Magic" were its principal shapes in the last four thousand years of the dominion of
Atlas.

Sneezing, idleness, smiling, were regarded as premonitory. Any cessation from
speech, even for a moment to take breath, was considered highly dangerous. The wish
to be alone was worse than all; the delinquent would be seized by his fellows, and
either killed outright or thrust into the compound of the phosphorus factory, from
which there was no escape.

* The same danger to society in our own time has been forseen, and an identical remedy
discovered and applied in compulsory education and cheap newspapers.

The habits of the people were incredibly disgusting. Their principle relaxations were
art, music and the drama, in which they could show achievement hardly inferior to that
of Henry Arthur Jones, Pinero, Lehar, George Dance, Luke Fildes and Thomas Sidney
Cooper.

Of medicine they were happily ignorant. The outdoor life in that equable climate bred
strong youths and maidens, and the first symptom of illness in a worker was held to
impair his efficiency and qualify him for the phosphorus factory.           Wages were
permanently high, and as there were no merchants even of alcohol, whose use was
forbidden, every man saved all his earnings, and died rich. At his death his savings
went back into the community. Taxation was consequently unnecessary. Clothes
were unnecessary and unknown, and the `bread from heaven' was the `free gift of
God'. The dead were thrown to the amphibians. Each man built his own shelter of
the rough stone sponge which abounded. The word `house' was used only in Atlas;
the servile race called its huts `Hhoklost' (equivalent to the English word `home').
Discontent was absolutely unknown. It had not been considered necessary to prohibit
traffic with foreign countries, as the inhabitants of such were esteemed barbarians.
Had a ship landed men, they would have been murdered to a man, supposing that
Atlas had permitted any approach to its shores. That it hindered such, and by
infallible means, was due to other considerations, whose nature will form the subject
of a subsequent chapter.

This then is the nature of the plains beneath Atlas, and the character of the servile race.

                               OF THE RACE OF ATLAS

In the city or `house' which was formed from the crest of every mountain, dwelt a race
not greatly superior in height to our own, but of vaster frame. The bulk and strength
of the bear is not inappropriate as a simile for the lower classes; the higher had the
enormous chest and shoulders and the lean haunches of the lion. This strength gave an
infallible beauty, made monstrous by their most inexorable law, that every child who
developed no special feature in the first seven years should be sacrificed to the Gods.
This special feature might be a nose of prodigious size, hands and wrists of gigantic
strength, a gorilla jaw, an elephant ear--or any of these might entitle its owner to life:*
for in all such variations from the normal they perceived the possibility of a
development of the race. Men and women were hairy as the ourang-outang, and all
were closely shaven from head to feet. It had been found that this practice developed
tactile sensibility. It was also done in reverence to the `Living Atla', of whom more in
its place.

The lower class was few in number. Its function was to superintend the servile race,
to bring the food of the children to the banqueting-hall, to remove the same, to attend
to the disposition of the `light-screens', to ensure the continuance of the race by the
begetting, bearing and nourishing of the children.

The priestly class was concerned with the further preparation of the Zro supplied by
the labour mills, and its impregnation with phosphorus. This class had much leisure
for `work', a subject to be explained later.

The High Priests and High Priestesses were restricted in number to eleven times
thirty-three in any one `house'. To them were entrusted the final secrets of Atlas, and
to them was confided the conduct of the experiments in which every will was bound
up.

The colour of the Atlanteans was very various, though the hair was invariably of a
fiery chestnut with bluish reflections. One might see women whiter than Aphrodite,
others tawny as Cleopatra, others yellow as Tu-Shi, others of a strange, subtle blue
like the tattooed faces of Chin women, others again red as copper. Green was
however a prohibited hue for women, and red was not liked in men. Violet was rare,
but highly prized, and children born of that colour were specially reared by the High
Priestess.

However, in one part of the body all the women were perfectly black with a blackness
no negro can equal; from this circumstance comes the name Atlas. It is absurdly
attributed by some authors to the deposit of excess of phosphorus in the Zro. I need

*Gautama Buddha was the reincarnation or legend of a previous Buddha who was a missionary
from Atlas, hence the account of his immovable neck, the ears that he could fold over his face,
and other monstrous details.
  There was a Governor of these, of whose name, nature and function I am not permitted to
speak.

only point out that the mark existed long before the discovery of black phosphorus. It
is evidently a racial stigma. It was the birth of a girl child without this mark which
raised her mother to the rank of goddess, and ended the terrestrial adventure of the
Atlanteans, as will presently appear.

Of the ethics of this people little need be said. Their word for `right' is `phph' made
by blowing with the jaw drawn sharply across from left to right, thus meaning `a spiral
life contrary to the course of the sun.' We may sum it as `contrary.' "Whatever is, is
wrong" seems to have been their first principle. Legs are `wrong' because they only
carry you five miles in the hour; let us refuse to walk; let us ride horseback. So the
horse is `wrong' compared to the train and motor-car; and these are `wrong' to the
`aeroplane'.    If speed had been the Atlantean's object, he would have thought
aeroplanes `wrong' and all else too, so long as the speed of light was not surpassed by
him.

Curious survivals of these laws are found in the Jewish transcript of the Egyptian
code, which they, being a slave race, interpreted in the verse manner.

"Thou shalt not make any graven image." Every male child, on attaining manhood,
had a graven image given him to worship, a miracle-working image, whose principal
exploits he would tattoo upon it.

"Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy." The Atlantean kept one day in seven
for all purposes unconnected with his principal task.

"Thou shalt not commit adultery." Though the Atlanteans married, intercourse with
the wife was the only act forbidden.

"Honour thy father and thy mother." On the contrary, they worshipped their children,
as if to say: "This is the God whom I have made in my own likeness."*

Similarly, there is one exception and one only to the rule of silence. It is the utterance
of the "Name" which it is death to pronounce. This word was constantly in their
mouths; it is Zcrra, a sort of venemous throat-gargling. Hence, possibly, the Gaelic
Scurr "speak", English "Scour" or "Scar" in Yorkshire and the Pennines. Zcrra is also
the name of the `High House', and of the graven image referred to above.

Other traces may be found in folklore; some mere superstitions. Thus the correct
number for a banquet was thirteen, because if there were only one more sign in the
Zodiac, the year would be a month longer, and one would have more time for `work'.
This is probably a debased Egyptian notion. Altanteans knew better than anyone that
the Zodiac is only an arbitrary division. Still it may be laid down that the impossible
never daunted Atlas. If one said, "Two and Two make Four" his thought would be
"Yes, damn it!"


* One of the most brilliant children committed suicide on learning that he could not move his
upper jaw. This boy is one of the eleven heroes who had statues in the High House. And the
Atlantean for `sorrow' in its ultimate sense (`Dukka' or `weltschmerz') is to wrench at the upper
jaw.

_____________________________________________________________________________________
                                THE LOST CONTINENT

I now explain the language of Atlas. The third and greatest of their philosophers saw
that speech had wrought more harm than good, and he consequently instituted a
peculiar rite. Two men were chose by lot to preserve the language, which, by the way,
consisted of monosyllables only, two hundred and fourteen in number, to each of
which was attached a diacritical gesture, usually ideographic.

Thus `wrong' is given as `phph' moving the jaw from right to left. Wiping the brow
with `phph' means "hot", hollowing the hands over the mouth `fire', striking the
throat, `to die'; so that each `radicle' may have hundreds of gesture-derivatives.
Grammar, by the way, hardly existed, the quick apprehension of the Atlanteans
rendering it unnecessary.

These two men then departed to a cavern on the side of the mountain just above the
cliff, and there for a year they remained, speaking the language, and carving it
symbolically upon the rock. At the end of the year they returned; the elder is
sacrificed, and the younger returns with a volunteer, usually one who wishes to
expiate a fault, and teaches him the language. During his visit he observes whether
any new thing needs a new name, and if so he invents it, and adds it to the language.
This process continued to the end. The rest of the people abandoned altogether the use
of speech, only a few years' practice enabling them to dispense with the radicle. They
then sought to do without gesture, and in eight generations the difficulty was
conquered, and telepathy established.*     Research then dovoted itself to the task of
doing without thought; this will be discussed in detail in the proper place. There was
also a `listener', three men who took turns to sit upon the highest peak, above the
`light-screens', and whose duty it was to give alarm if any noise disturbed Atlas. On
their report that High Priest charged with active governorship would take steps to
ascertain and destroy the cause.

The `light-screens' spoken of were a contrivance of laminæ of a certain spar such that
the light and heat of the sun were completely cut off, not by opacity, but by what we
cann `interference'. In this way other subtler rays of the sun entered the `house', these
rays being supposed to be necessary to live. These matters were the subjects of the
deepest controversey. Some held that these rays themselves were injurious, and
should be excluded. Others considered that the light-screens should be put in position
during moonlight, instead of being opened at sunset, as was the custom. This,
however, was never attempted, the great mass of the people being devoted to the
moon. Others wished full sunlight, the aim of Atlas being (they thought) to reach the
sun. But this theory contradicted the prime axiom of attaining things through their
opposites, and was only held by the lower classes, who were not initiates into this
doctrine.




* This system of communication has great advantages over any other. It is independent of
distance, and dependent on the will of the transmitter. Telepathic messages could not be
`tapped' or miscarry in any way.

The `houses' of Atlas were carved from the living rock by the action of Zro in its
seventh precipitation. Enormously solid, the walls were lofty and smoother than glass,
though the pavements were rough and broken almost everywhere for a reason which I
am not permitted to disclose. The passages were invariably narrow, so that two
persons could never pass each other. When two met, it was the law to greet by joining
in `work' and then going away together on their separate errands, or passing one
above the other. This was done purposely, so as to remind every man of his duty to
Atlas on every occasion on which he might meet a fellow-citizen.

The Banqueting-Hall of the children was usually very large. The furniture, which had
been brought by the first colonists, and gradually disused by adults, never needed
repair. A vast open doorway facing North opened on the mountainside on to the
vineyards and orchards, the meadows and gardens, in which the children passed their
time. Suckled by the mother for three months only, the child was then already able to
nourish itself on the bread and wine, and on the flesh of the amphibian herds, of which
there were several kinds; one a piglike animal with flesh resembling wild duck,
another a sort of manatee tasting like salmon, its fat being somewhat like caviar in
everything but texture, and a sure specific for any of childhood's troubles. A third, the
ancestor of our hippopotamus, was really tamed, and was employed by the serviles for
preparing the ground for the corn, trampling though the fields while they were covered
with sea-water, and thus leaving deep holes in which the seeds were cast. Its flesh was
not unlike bear, but more delicate. Notable, too, was the great quantity of turtle; also
the giant oysters, the huge deep sea crabs, a kind of octopus whose flesh made a
nutritious and elegant soup, and innumerable shell fish, added to the table. The
waterways were haunted by shoals of a small and poisonous fish,* whose bit was
immediate death to man, a fact which altogether cut off communication between one
island and another except by air, as the hippopotamus-animal, although immune to its
bite, was unable to swim.

Of the sleeping chambers I shall tell more particularly in the course of my remarks on
Zro.

               COMBINED WITH IT: AND OF BLACK PHOSPHORUS

It was the most ancient tradition of the Atlantean magicians that they were the
survivors of a race inhabiting a country called Lemuria, of which the South Pacific
archipelago may be the remains.             These Lemurians had, they held, built up a
civilisation equal if not superior to their own; but through a misunderstanding of a
magical law--some said the 2nd, some the 5th, some the 23rd--had involved
themselves and their land in ruin. Others thought that the Lemurians had succeeded in
their magical task, and broken their temple. In any case, it was the secret Lemurian
tradition that they themselves represented the survivals of a yet earlier race who lived
in ice, and they again of yet another who lived in fire, and they again of the earliest
colonists from Mars. The theory, in fine, was that the aim of man is to attain to the
Sun, whence, according to one school of cosmology, he was exiled in the cosmic
catastrophe which resulted in the formation of Neptune. His task on any given planet
was therefore to overturn the laws of Nature on that planet, thus mastering it
sufficiently to enable him to make the leap to the next planet inward. Exactly how and
in what sense the leap was made remains obscure, even to heirs of Atlantis.*

The men of Atlas could fly, it is true, and that by a method so simple that men will
laugh outright when it is rediscovered; but they needed air to support them; they could
not confront the cold and emptyness of space. Was it in some subtler body that they
conveyed their Palladium? Or, content to die, could they project that supreme vehicle
across so great a distance? The answer to such questions probably lies in the recovery
by mankind of the knowledge of Zro and its properties.
Beneath the labour mills run troughs in which the sweat of the workers collects and
drains off into an open basin without the mill. In this basin churns with immense
rapidity--through multiple bevel gearing--a sort of paddle with knife edges. The
sweat is thus churned into froth, and gradually disappears, and is as constantly
replaced. The workers toil in shifts--eight hors work, four hours repose, eight hours
work, four hours rest and recreation. The mills never cease day or night.

The basin is of polished silver and agate, and is set at an angle, facing two enormous
spheres of crystal, encased in a sort of trellis made of a certain greenish metal, its
optical focus at a point midway between the two.

The only sign of activity is that out of this focus a spark crackles unless the air be dry,
a condition difficult to secure in this part of the world, although fans blow air, driven
over chloride of calcium and sulphuric acid, over the globes and their focus. These fans
are worked by tidal power, human labour being appropriated absolutely to the one use.

*The point was discussed fully, and finally relegated, in the Council of Stockholm, 1913.
 The scene is so real to me that I find it impossible to avoid using the historic present here and
elsewhere, inadvertently.
  There are six other pieces of apparatus to insultate and carry to the basin the six subtler
principles of sweat.

In the temple of the `house' are two globes similar to those upon the plains, and the
mysterious force generated below is transferred to those above, collecting within
them. Now the name of this substance is always Zro, but in its first state the gesture is
a twiddling of the thumbs. In its second, it is a rapid twittering of the fingers, and in
its third state of distillation it is a screwing of the hands together. Within the spheres it
sublimes suddenly in the air as a snaky power (4) of silver, which immediately turns to
an iridescent fluid (5) that is forced up, by its own need of expansion, through a
fountain into the temple, on whose floor it lies (6) in a semi-solid condition. Expert
priests then gather this in their hands, and rapidly shape it into its seventh state, when
it is like a knife of diamond, but alive. An instrument like a Mexican machete is used
to carve rocks. The edge shears them, the back smooths them. The rock behaves
exactly like wax, responsive to the lightest touch. What is not used for weapons is
then gathered up swiftly and kneaded by women of the rank of high priestess. It is not
known even to the high priests with what they knead it, but in its eighth stage it is a
substance solid enough to support great weight, but eternally heaving of its own force.
Of this they make bed, so that the sleeping Atlantean is (as it were) continually
massaged. To this they attribute the fact that the Atlanteans sleep never more than
half an hour, though they do so four times daily. These beds remain active only for a
few days, and they are then thrown into the ninth stage by being taken into a room
where is a caldron of great size. They are thrown into this and sprinkled with black
phosphorus.* The Zro then divides into two parts, one liquid, one solid. Neither of
these has any ascertainable properties, for it is absolutely passive to the will of the
user, who may taste therein his utmost desire, whether for food or drink. Among
adults there is no other food or drink than this. The children are not allowed to taste it.

The black phosphorus is always added by a high priestess, and it is not known to me in
what manner she does this. The Zro that may remain is the subject of eternal
experiments by the Magicians. It is generally thought by the greatest of them that an
error was committed in bringing to a ninth stage of division into two, and many openly
deplored the discovery of black phosphorus. All however strive in harmony to
produce a tenth stage that shall surpass the virtues of the ninth. Theoretically it is
possible to reach an eleventh stage wherein the Zro takes human form, and lives!
Opinion is divided as to whether this was not actually done by a certain magician at
the time of the passing of Atlas. In any case, I beg the reader to remember that I have
only described one seventh of the virtues of Zro, and I have even omitted this, that in
its ninth stage it is not only food and drink, but universal medicine, if properly
understood. For Zro is also a vision and a voice!

Now the muscles of the people of Atlas are the muscles of giants, and yet they do one
thing only. And this thing is combined by the wisdom of the Magicians, so that it is at
the same time work, exercise, sport, game, pleasure and all else that may fulfil life.


*Only the smallest quantity is required, and it is unchanged, its function being purely catalytic.
This form of phosphorus is one of the most stable of elements. It combines (so far as is known)
only with Zro.     But if thrown out of such a combination, it becomes ordinary yellow
phosphorus.

                                  THE LOST CONTINENT

This work never ceases. It has these parts.

     1.   Working at Zro, i.e., bringing it from the first stage to the ninth.
     2.   Working with Zro, i.e., for one's own particular purpose.
     3.   Working for Zro. This is the common and most honorable task, the Zro eaten
and drunken being worked by the working into a quintessence of higher power, though
identical in property with the common Zro. This new Zro (Atlas Zro) goes through
the same stages as the common Zro of the serviles. But it is the result of free and
joyful labour, and so serves the Magicians in their experiments, and the Governor of
all for his sustenance. None by the way is ever wasted. For example, a tunnel was
drilled completely through the earth and filled with Zro, and it is said that by this
tunnel the Atlanteans escaped.

This working, whether with or for Zro, requires two persons at least at any one name
and place. Great heat is generated in the working, and the bodies of the workers are
therefore sprinkled heavily with the black phosphorus, which is incombustible. This
black phosphorus, poisonous to the servile race, becomes innocuous to anyone who
has been in any way impregnated with Zro. This itself, in its first state, is as
dangerous as electricity of high voltage.

The reverence attached to Zro is unbounded. At one time it was hymned as the father
of the gods, and till the end all children were thought to be "begotten of Zro," though
everyone might know who was the father.* All such conception was however held
indignity. Its official name was `the old experiment.' It was carried on simply
because the new methods of continuing the race were not perfected. Childbirth was
therefore in one way an accident; although a duty, everyone shrank from it. For
though no pain or discomfort attached to the process, it was a sort of second-best
achievement from which proud women turned contemptuously. This was in part the
reason why the father's name was never mentioned.

On several occasions in the history of Atlas the Zro `failed.' Although not changed in
appearance, its properties were lost or diminished. In such a case young men and
maidens in great numbers were captures on the plains, brought into Atlas, and offered
in sacrifice to the God. Their blood was mingled with Zro in its third stage, and the
latter regained its potency. Their flesh was eaten by the high priests and priestesses in
penance for the unknown wrong. It was subject to other and terrible scourges, being
the most sensitive as well as the strongest thing on earth. On one occasion it had to be
treated with a fox-like perfume prepared by the chief magician; on another it was
subjected to streams of moonlight from parabolic mirrors.

The most serious crisis was some two thousand years before the destruction of Atlas.
One of the serviles, riding his `hippopotamus' to the ploughing, fell off and was
instantly bitten by the poisonous fish previously described. Through an accident of
boyhood he had, however, for a reason too obscure to describe here, no such

*In spite of the absolute promiscuity of the Atlanteans, this was never in doubt, owing to the
special mark of each man, whose stigma or variation was infallibly transmitted.
 This item is loosely used, as equivalent of `life.' The sacrifice is described later, and the point
made clear.

vulnerable spot as suited the Zhee-Zhou. He survived, and went to work, as it
chanced, the next day. The Zro was poisoned; a third of Atlas died within the hour;
the plant on the affected island had to be destroyed, and all its people. It was only
repopulated some three hundred and eighty years later, and then for particular reasons
of magical economy impossible to dwell upon in this account.

Marriage was compulsory on all those whose passion had been so exclusive and
enduring as to produce two children. Further intercourse between the pair was thus
barred. The Magicians thought that it was inimical to variation for a woman to have
more than one child (á fortiori two) by the same father; and the custom further
prevented those stupid sporadic outburst of burnt-out lust which make so many
modern marriages intolerable.

Closely connected with marriage, the close of the reproductive life, is that of death,
the close of the little that remains. Death hardly threatened the Atlantean; he would
decide to `go and see', as the old phrase ran, and take an overdose of a particular
preparation of black phosphorus mixed with a very little Zro in the ninth stage, which
ensured a painless death. That none ever returned was taken as a proof of the supreme
attractiveness of death.

The ghoulish and necromantic practices with which Atlanteans have been unjustly
reproached never occurred. A little vampirsm, perhaps, in the early days before the
perfecting of Zro; but no Atlantean was ever so stupid or so ignorant as to confuse
death with life.

Beside this voluntary death only one danger existed. As the use of Zro guaranteed life
and health and youth--a centenarian high priest was no better than a kitten!--so did
its abuse spell instant corruption of those qualities. As mentioned above, now and
then the Zro itself was at fault, and caused epidemics; but from time to time there were
deaths in a peculiarly loathesome form caused by what they called `misunderstanding'
the Zro.* Such mistakes were particularly common in the early days of its discovery
and before its use had become well nigh a worship. The first symptom was a crack in
the skin of the temple, or sometimes of the bridge of the nose, more rarely of the
eyelid or cheek. Within a few minutes this crack became an open sore, of horrid
foetor, and, within twentyfour hours, the patient was completely rotted away, bone and
marrow. A circumstance of singular atrocity was that death never occurred until the
spinal column collapsed. No treatment could be found even to prolong the agony by
an hour. This being recognised, sufferers were thrown from the cliffs at the first sign
of the malady. In this way too were all other corpses disposed. It was the most
honourable death possible, for becoming `bread from heaven' for the serviles, they
were again worked up into Zro itself, a transmutation which in their view would be
well worth all the `resurrections of the body' and `immortalities of the soul' of the
theoretical, dogmatic, hearsay religions.

So much then concerning Zro, and the matters immediately connected with it.

* No other disease was known after the bringing of the Zro to its ninth stage, all indisposition
being instantly cured by a single dose.

               OF THE SO CALLED MAGIC OF THE ATLANTEANS

Magic in Atlas was a `Science of Sciences.' It was the final integration of all
knowledge.     In method its theory was differentiation, and in theory its method
integration. For example, the fifth of the great philosophers indicated "Everything is
Zro" to the Keeper of the Speech at the annual sacrifice. This in spite of the fact that
in that very year two new forms of Zro had been discovered by that same philosopher.
It was the third of the galaxy who announced "The ultimate analysis of sensation is
pain; that of thought, madness; that of super-consciousness (a state of trance induced
by Zro and valued above all things) annihilation."

His successor had retorted that in this was implicit a postulate that pain, madness and
annihilation were undesirable. The third admitted that he had so mean his phrase, but
destroying the postulate, still stuck to it. All this was the foundation of much magical
theory, and on these purely psychological researches was based the whole magical
practice. `There is no God' was a commonplace. It only implied that the mind was
wrong to try to conceive with in it what was by definition without it. To set limits to
anything whatever seemed to them the greatest of crimes, the exact opposite of the
true path to the Sun.

The practical side of magic was for the most part a mere utilization of known forces,
such as are employed by modern science. But the resources of Atlas were as great,
and the advantages incomparably greater. The whole archipelago was a laboratory.
There was no question of the `cost of research'; every man was devoted to it. Every
man thought only of the main problem "How to reach Venus" and its sub-issues.
Further, the main laws of magic had always been found to govern and include
chemical and physical laws.

In the early days of colonization Zro was only known in its crude state; it was the
genius of a single man that obtained the third state in purity. From this state to the
seventh it moved almost of itself, very much as radium does. The genius, having
sufficient in this pure seventh state, made a sword, and completed in three days the
subjugation of the servile races. It was a stroke of fortune, this quickness, for on the
fourth day the Zro began to disintergrate. The magicians then began to seek a means
of making this state permanent. In this they failed,* so that knives had always to be
replaced twice weekly; but in the course of their failures they discovered the infinitely
more valuable eighth and ninth states of Zro. Tradition has preserved a hint of their
efforts in Alchemy with its problems of the fixation of the Universal Mercury, the
secret of perpetual motion, and `potable gold--the Universal Medicine'. It had been
theoretically determined towards the end of the tenth state, that Zro should be a solid,
but whether this was confirmed is beyond my knowledge.


*No known state of pure Zro is stable. From this it will be seen how entirely Atlas was in the
hands of the servile races. Fortunately no trouble ever arose; the supply of labour was always
ample.

                                        LIBER LI

To return to the main magical theory, the Quintessence, said they, or Universal
Substance (which some strove to identify with Hyle, others with the Luminiferous
æthyr) is the two-in-one, liquid and solid, the former part being also twofold, fluid and
gaseous, and the latter earthy and fiery. The combination of these four phases of Zro
accounted for the universe. This Quintessence is Zro in some state unknown and
incalculable. Some expected to find it in its 12th state, some in a 17th, others in a 37th:
all this was pure guesswork. Some tradition to this effect appears to have reached
Plato; and the neo-Platonists combined with those Jews who had preserved fragments
of the Egyptian tradition to form a new initiated hierarchy, the echo of whose teaching
is found in Paracelsus. At one period, too, missionaries (not colonists, as has been
ignorantly asserted; there was no trouble of over-population in Atlas) were sent to the
four quarters and parties landed in Mexico, Ireland and Egypt. The adventures of the
party who travelled South form an astounding chapter in the history of Atlas. It was
they who discovered the Magnetic South, and whose observations rendered possible
the theory which resulted in the piercing of the Earth by Zro.*

Besides all I have recounted, Zro had many extraordinary powers. These were
however called `lesser', and discarded and forgotten in the absorption in the principal
work. Nearly all of these are found in the combinations of Zro in its sixth state with
black phosphorus in varying proportions. Thus one product is called `fierly flying
serpent.' A pellet pinched off and thrown into the air elongates itself and flies in the
direction desired, killing the person whom it strikes. Another was called `Eye of the
Gods.' It was a metal resembling platinum, and made into tiny mirrors worn in rings,
or even attached by a special process to the thumbnail. The seer could then behold
any place or person he chose to name. A similar product, nearly all phosphorus, was
like vulcanite, and was worn inside the ear by anyone who wished to hear anything
that was being said anywhere. There was also a red transparent lip-salve, which
compelled lov in any who saw it. Its use had been abandoned early in the history of
Atlas, through the witty satires of a poet, and the more serious strictures of a
philosopher who perceived its liability to abuse. Again a thin paste of almost pure Zro
made the wearer invisible. The poet was again successful in bringing this into
contempt by suggesting that people resorted to it to hide their ugliness. This poet was
one of the few Atlanteans who suffered violent death, except in voluntary sacrifice.

There were also preparations of Zro which increased the size of the user, and others
which diminished it. In general use among the lower classes, until the very end, was
that composition which made the body light. Careful adjustment would equalize its
weight with the displaced air, and movements of the limbs would then permit flying.
In this way the overseers visited the plains and returned. The other and earlier art of
flying needed no apparatus, but I am forbidden to disclose the method, except to hint
that it is connected closely with the art of `dreaming true.'




* There was also a settlement in Finland. Its only remains in historic period is "Lapland
Witches."

These are but a few of the magic powers so-called of the compounds of Zro; but they
will indicate the power of Atlas by shewing what it could afford to neglect. Yet all
these powers were implicit in the process of `working.'

The art of prediction was in the same unsatisfactory state as it is in England today.
Nor was its practice encouraged. A magician makes the future, and does not seek to
divine it. All true prediction was therefore necessarily catastrophe. The greatest good
fortune seemed worthless to an Atlantean, since it was accident, and if accidents are to
happen, one of them may be fatal. They believe themselves to be equal to the whole
tendency of things, and proudly gazed on Nature as a man might upon a virgin captive
to his spear. Everything that was Being was Zro; everything that was Energy was
`working for Zro.' Outside this was but by-product and waste-heap.

The arrangement of the houses was in accordance with the magical theory. There was
first the High House, then four (later six, last ten) "Houses of Houses"; and to each of
these was attached a varying number of ordinary houses. The High House was the
central shrine of the whole archipelago, and must be separately described.

            OF THE HIGH HOUSE OF ATLAS, OF ITS INHABITANTS,
                    AND OF THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS
                              AND OF THE LIVING ATLA

The High House was separated from its nearest neighbour by over twenty miles of
sea. Its diameter was about an half-mile and its height some four miles. It had no
plains at the base, and its cliffs went absolutely sheer and smooth into the water. It
was in shape a flattish cylinder, but the top broadened into a pointed knob, somewhat
in style of St. Basil's at Moscow. There was not a trace of vegetation, which, by the
way, was despised by the Atlanteans. A child would kick a flower contemptuously,
thinking "Thou cannot even move about", or pet it as an English degenerate woman
does a dog. The only entrance was by an orifice at the top. But the base was
tunnelled so that from every house was a channel for the Zro which having been
brought to the highest perfection was thus transferred to headquarters. The receptacle
at the base being far below the earth, and the Zro further heated by friction, it seethed
constantly into a bluish or purplish smoke. This was the sole sustenance of the
inhabitants of the High House. In early days the old High House, in an island since
destroyed by order of the Atla, had been called the House of Blood, the inhabitants
subsisting only on blood sucked from the living. The improvements in Zro had
changed all that; but the idea was the same, to live only on the Quintessence of Life.
Hence while the `houses' ate and drank Zro, the High House drank its vapour. No
children were born in it, and none below the rank of High Priest dwelt there.

Except for one matter which was never thought of, though constantly spoken, the
inmost mystery of the High House was the `Living Atla.' This had many names,
"Wordeater", "Unshaven" (because the razors of Zro were turned on its hair),
"Fireheart", "Beginning and End" and so on; but especially a word I can only translate
as "To her", a defective pronoun existing only in the Dative. What the Living Atla
really was, is a secret of secrets.* We know it only from its epithets, its veils. Thus it
was "That Black which makes black white." It was "twenty-six feet high and fifteen
feet across--Oh my Lords, it is the essence of the Incommensurable!" It was "the
wife of Zro", "the heart of Zro", "the desire of Zro", "The Atla that eats Atlas", "the
swallower-up of her own house", "the pelican", "the fire-nest of the Phoenix",
according to the createst of the poets. And the burden of his hymns of worship was
that it must be destroyed.

It was impossible to approach the Atla without being instantly sucked up and
devoured by it. This was the greatest death, and ardently desired by all. The favour
accorded only to those who discovered improvements in Zro, or otherwise merited
signal and supreme recognition from the state. Hidden men listened to the cries of the
victim, and thus learned the nature of the death. It appears that the black suddenly


*There are various theories: one a sort of avatar affair, another that the Atla is a quintessence of
some kind; another called `To her' the `Angel of Venus, the force of our aspiration.'

broke into a fiery rose, "the only* luminous thing in Atlas", and shooting forward
enclosed him. For some reason which was never even guessed the Atla refused
women. Those who had seen Atla were however useless to instruct. They came forth
from the Presence smiling, and even under the most fearful tortures that the magicians
could devise, continued to smile. This smile never left them during life, and the
conscious superiority of it was so irritating, and so contrary to the harmony of life in
Atlas that the women were killed, and their companions for the future forbidden to
approach the Atla.

Whatever theories as to its nature may have been formed by the magicians were upset
by a famous experiment. A most holy high priest, a man who at puberty had insisted
on immediate marriage with all the women of his house, a magician who had formed
four new compounds of Zro, and discovered how to pass matter through matter, was
honoured by the great death. On reaching the last corridor, where the concentrated
spirals of Zro vapour whirlded up into the Presence of Atla, he bade farewell to the
appointed listeners in the manner suitable to his dignity, and then, taking a last deep
draught of Zro into his lungs, rushed into the antrum. They heard him cry alound "O!"
with surprise, and then with inexpressible rapture the words "Behind Atla, Otla!"
which were, and still are, completely unintelligible. Their surprise was greated, when,
seven days later, he came striding past them without greeting. He went to his `house'
and shut himself up, was never seen or heard again, but was assuredly still living at the
time of the `catastrophe.' This man founded a school of philosophy, or rather, it
founded itself on what is supposed him to have discovered; and this school disputes
with the orthodox the credit of the final success.

The lesser mysteries of the High House were concerned almost entirely with the
creation of life, and the bridging of the gulf between Earth and Venus. These were
connected intimately; the theory was that it Atlantean brains could exist in bodies
sufficiently subtle to traverse æther,the task was done. Some of the experiments were
crude enough, and, to our minds, horrible. They attempted to breed a new race by
crossing with snakes, swans, horses and other animals. The Greek legends of such
monsters as Chimæra, Medusa, Lamia, Minotaur, the Centaurs, the Satyrs and the like
are mere filtrations of the Atlantean tradition.             The only theory behind such
experiments was that they were contrary to the natural order, and so worth trying.
Men of more scientific mind more plausibly passed Zro vapour through sea-water; but
they only created serpents of vast size, which they cast into the sea about the High
House as guardians. The sea-serpent, whether legend or fact, is derived from this
experiment. It is quite possible that some still survive. Another school, objecting
strongly to the sex-process "which must be transcended as the Lemurians overcame
gemmation" vivisected men and women, taking various parts of the brain, especially

*A mere compliment.
  Especially monkeys. The results of this experiment were sent to colonize an island, but
escaped, and after many journeys, reached Japan, where their descendant flourish still.
  [A note next to this word in the Smith TS reads "incorrect ­ 7" but gives no alternative
reading; and in any case, since "gemmation" means asexual reproduction by budding, it makes
perfect sense in this context and is probably correct. ­ T.S.]

the cerebellum, the pineal gland, and the pituitary body, and cultivated them in
solutions of Zro under the invisible rays of black phosphorus. The best result of this
was a race of transclucent jelly-folk of great intellectual development; but so far from
being able to travel through space, they could hardly move in their own element.
Another school argued that as Zro in vapour combined the virtues of the liquid and the
solid Zro, so a fiery state might be produced which would so impregnate their bodies
as to make them "mates of the æther." This school held that the fiery Zro already
existed in Nature, `in the heart of the living Atla', and asserted that those who died by
absorption into Atla passed straight to Venus. Many of them therefore tried hard to
obtain messages from that planet. Familiar with Newton's first law of motion, they
further held it possible to prepare Zro in such a state that a current of it could never be
deflected or dissipated, and so, if it could be made in sufficient quantity, a bridge to
Venus might be built by which they might travel. They therefore tunneled through the
planet, as previously explained, to have a sort of cannon for the Zro. But as their
supply was pitifully insufficient, they endeavoured to also to prepare as Zro which
would have the power of multiplying itself. Alchemical tradition has some record of
this problem.

Yet another group of magicians argued that as Nature had cast off the planets from the
Sun--a disputed point, some thinking this due to magic, which if so completely
destroys the argument--it would be contrary to Nature to cause the planets to fall back
into it. They busied themselves with attempts to increase the Earth's gravitational
pull, and (alternatively) to check her course. Their schemes were generally regarded
as Utopian--yet they could boast of the discovery of the Zro that lightened bodies,
and of a kind of æther-screen which generated mechanical power in inexhaustible
quantities by making matter slightly opaque to æthyr. This engine only worked on a
very small scale. A screen two inches long would tear itself from fastenings that
would have held an earthquake, while the rocks in the neighbourhood would melt in a
few minutes, and the sea boil instantly where its rays struck. The most brilliant of this
school asserted "Matter is a disease of Zro" which may be translated nearly enough
"Matter is a strain in the æther." He explained gravitation in this way. Place two
ivory spheres in a rubber tube; the strain on the tube is least when the balls touch. The
tendency is therefore for them to come together. Friction alone checks them. Now
æther is infinitely elastic and without friction. From these data he calculated the Law
of Inverse Squares.

A more mystic school saw life everywhere. It knew all that we know, and more, about
ions and electrons; it saw every phenomenon as a manifestation of Will.               The
crowning glory of this school was the discovery that Zro in its ninth stage, eaten and
drunk with concentrated intention, produces the desired result, whatever (within wide
limits) that result might be. This went far to supercede the use of all specialized forms
of Zro, and so to unify the magical practice.

It seems curious with all this magic, Magic itself should be the thing most deplored.
But it was the means, and, as such, `that which is in particular not the end.' The word
for Magic, Ijynx, was the only disyllable in the language, for Magic was the essentially

twofold thing, more twofold (in a way) than the number two itself. It is interesting
here to sketch briefly the mathematics of Atlas. The task is not easy, as their minds
worked very differently from ours.

The number 1 was a fairly simple idea; but two was not only two, but also `the result
of adding 1 to 1' and `the root of 4.' The numbers grew in complexity out of all
reason. Seven was 6 plus 1, and 5 plus 2, and 4 plus 3, and so on; as wellas `the root
of 49', `half 14', and the like. They even distinguished 4 plus 3 from 3 plus 4. Each
number also represents an idea or group of ideas on all sorts of planes. It would have
been quite possible to discuss dressmaking in terms of pure number. To give an
example of the way in which their minds thought, consider the number three. Three,
in so far as it gives the first plane figure, suggests superficies; with regard to the
dimensions of space, solidity. Three itself is therefore `that ineffably holy thing in
which the superficies is the solid.' Of course hundred of other ideas must be added to
this; and to grasp and harmonize them all in one colossal supra-rational idea was the
constant task of every mathematician. The upshot of this was that all numbers above
33 were regarded as spurious, illusionary; they had no real existence of their own;*
they were temporary compounds, unreal in very much the same sense as our ­1.
They were always expressed by graphic formulæ, like our own organic compounds.
To take an example, the number 156 was regarded as a sort of efflorescene of the

number 7: it was never written but as     77+ 7+7 +77. Again 11 was usually written 3 + 5
                                               7
+ 3. It was always the aim to find symmetry in these expressions, and also `to find an
easy way to 1.' This last is difficult to explain.

Eleven was their great `Key of Magic.' It is a twofold number in `the act of becoming
1.' Thirty-seven was `the essence of 1' inasmuch as multiplying it by 3 gives 111,
three ones, which divided again by three in another manner, yield 1. `One would
rather think of 48 as 37 plus 11 than as 4 times 12' is the statement of an elementary
text-book dating from the earliest days of Atlas. It was a sort of moral duty to teach
the mind to think in this manner.

The number 7 was the `perfect number' with them as with us, but for very different
reasons. It was the link between Earth and Venus, for one thing; I cannot explain
why. It was `the number of the Atla', and the `house of success' (two being the
`house of battle). It was also grace, softness, ease, healing and `joy of Zro' as well as
`play of phosphorus.' Many mathematicians, however, attacked it with vigour; there
was at one time an almost general consent to replace it by 8, and its `rapture-
combination' 31, by 33.         Despite the intence preoccupation with such ideas,
mathematics as we know them had reached a perfection which if it does not surpass
that of our own civilization, fails principally because its theorems, handed down to
Euclid and Pythagoras, although imperfectly, formed a springboard whence we might
leap.


*A partial exception existed for prime numbers, as being `self-generated', and each of these
which had been investigated had its special (and comparatively simple) signification.

The initiation of children was also a matter reserved for the High House. Weaned at
three months, the children were tended by the lower classes until the age of puberty,
an occurrence which fitted them at once for initiation. A legate from the High House
was sent for, and in his presence the child was brought, acquainted with Zro by both
its father and its mother, and full instruction in `working' was further conferred by any
member of the `house' who chose to do so, this in practice meaning by everybody.
The ceremonies were frequently long and exhausting; children often died in the course
of them. This was not regarded as a serious calamity; some schools of magicians even
pretended to rejoice. The representative of the High House had a prior right to the
parents of the child; at times he conducted the initiation in person, a high honour, but
invariably fatal. On rare occasions male children were sent over to the Atla to be
devoured. The parents of so fortunate a child were advanced in rank on the spot, and
had special privileges conferred on them, sometimes even being transferred to a
`House of Houses.' All those who dwelt in the High House were veiled whenever
they appeared, in order to prevent it being known that they were of the same
appearance in all respects as their inferiors. This ordinance had been made after the
Great Conspiracy, with which I shall deal in the chapter on History.

           OF THE UNDERGROUND GARDENS OF ATLAS, AND OF
           THE ALLEGED COMMERCE OF THE ATLANTEANS WITH
             INCUBI, SUCCUBI, AND THE DEMONS OF DARKNESS

I have referred to the contempt with which the Atlanteans were prone to regard the
vegetable kingdom. Animals, including men, shared their scorn. The idea may have
been that with all their advantages they ought to have done much better for
themselves.      Minerals, however, were regarded as helpless; and hence the
extraordinary attention paid to them. Beneath the houses the rock had been tunnelled
out into grottos, some in odd fantastic forms, but most in immense polyhedra or
combinations of curves. Each `house' and some twenty of such gardens Three
reagents were used in the cultivation; the `seed of metals', the `seed of Light' and the
`seed of ...', an untranslatable idea approximating to our `mystic's interpretation of
`Alpha and Omega.' The two former produced simple effects, the first formed jewels,
self-luminous, which yet grew like flowers, the second similar effects with metals;
while the third brought any mineral to flower in the most extravagent combinations of
colour and form. All such conditions as texture, hardness, elasticity, and physical
attributes in general, were considered worthy of the profoundest attention.

As an instance of these, I may describe particular gardens. One would have a roof of
softly-glowing sapphires, foxglove, bluebell, or gentian, and between these champak
stars of ruby. The walls would be covered with tendrils of vine within whose depths
lurked tiny blooms of amethyst. The floor would be of malachite, but alive, growing
as coral does, softer than any earthly moss and more elastic to the tread. On every
darker leaf might glow dew-drops of self-strung diamond formed from the carbon
dioxide of the air by the action of the `seed of light'. Another grotto would be a
monochrome of blue, various copper salts being `planted' everywhere, and growing in
incrustations and festoons of every shade of blue from the faintest tinge of coelrulean
azure to the depths of ultra marine and indigo.         The floor would be mingled,
transclucent blue and green and grey, in whose abyss would be seen shapes of
anemones, perhaps of such hues as iron oxide, silver chromate, and cuprammonium
cyanurate. All this floor would in all respects resemble water but for its greater
solidity, and floating on it would be giant lilies, great green leaves of emerald with
cups of pearl not less than 12 feet in diameter, with corollæ of pure gold, so fine that
they glimmered green, with pistills of platinum on whose tops trembled great pigeon-
blooded rubies. Another might be wholly of metal, a mere bower of jasmine, with its
floor of violets. The law of growth of these creatures of wisdom was not that of plants
or animals, or even of crystals; it was that of the earth. Constantly growing at the
planet approached the sun, they as steadily shrank as she departed to aphelion. This
was not growth and decay, but the rise and fall of an eternal bosom. It is probably,
too, that this is one of the reasons why Atlas neglected the higher kingdoms; they had
learned to grow, but on wrong lines, and it was too late to endeavour to correct the
error.

These gardens were the principal places of working. It was hardly possible to pass
from one place to another without coming upon one of them, so cunningly were they
distributed; and in every garden would be found, joyful and noble, parties of workers
intent upon their beloved task. The passer-by would gladly join of such parties,
engage in the work for as long as he wished, and then proceed upon his private
business. In these same gardens, too, were salvers and goblets always filled with Zro,
and after toil, refreshment fitted the workers to return to labour.

Now of these workings the gardens strange tales are told. It is said that the inhabitants
falling to repose were visited by incubi and succubi (whatever the nature of these may
be, and I by no means concur in the opinion of Sinistrari*), and that they welcomed
such with eagerness. Nay, darker legends tell of infamous commerce and intercourse
with demons foul and malicious, and pretend that the power of Atlas was devilish, and
that the catastrophe was the judgement of God. These medieval fables of the debased
and perverted phallicism miscalled Christianity are unworthy even to be refuted,
founded as they are on hypotheses contrary to common sense. Nor would they who
knew themselves masters of the earth have deigned to degrade themselves, and
moreover to vitiate their whole work by commerce with inferiors. If there be any truth
whatever in these stories, it will then be more easily supposable that the Atlanteans
aspiring to journey sunwards to Venus, might invoke the beings of that planet, should
it be possible for them to travel to us. And that this is impossible who can assert? On
the theory of the Magicians, power increases as the sun is approached, the inhabitants
of earth being more highly infused with the magical force of Our Star than those of
Mars, and they again more than those of great Jupiter, gloomy and disastrous Saturn
and Uranus, or Neptune lost in star-dreams. Again, the powers of each particular
planet may, nay, must be wholly diverse. So fundamental a condition of existence as
the value of g being vastly various, must not the inhabitants differ equally in body and
in mind? What lives on the minute and airless moon can be no inhabitant of what may
hide beneath the flaming envelope of the sun, with its fountains of hydrogen flaming
an hundred thousand miles into the æther. And surely so wild an ambition as that of
Atlas would not have been held by beings so wise and powerful for so many centuries
had they not either a sure memory of their coming from Mars, or some earnest of their
eventual departure to Venus. Man does not persist in the chimerical for more than a
few generations. Alchemy achieved results so startling and so beneficial to humanity
at large--one need only mention the discovery of zinc, antimony, hydrogen, opium,
gas itself--that the original ideals were changed for others more limited and more
practical--or at least more immediately realizable.

Nor is this view unsupported by testimony of a sort. "Unreal and glorious, rays of our
father the Sun", says one of the poets of Atlas, "are they within us. Let us call them
forth by utterance that is not uttered, by the gesture that is not made, by the working

redeemed) and the English edition prosecuted for obscenity ­ T.S.]

that is above all working, for they are great and glorious, rays of our father the Sun.
Then from our bride that waits for us in the nuptial chamber, green in the green West,
blue in the blue East, exalted above our father in the even and in the morn, spring forth
our heirs and our hosts, to greet us in the darkness. Dim-glimmering are our gardens
in the light of the seed of light; they are peopled with shadows; they take form; they
are serpents, they are as trees, they are as the holy Zcrra, they are as all things straight
or curved, they are winged, they are wonderful. With us do they work, and that which
was but one is seven, and that which was two is become eleven! With us do they
work, and give us of the draught miraculous; us do they instruct in magic, and feed us
the delicate food. Let us call forth them that are within us, that they that are without
may enter in, as it was made manifest by Him that maketh secret." This passage, not
devoid of a rude eloquence, makes clear what was held in exoteric circles. For in
Atlas the poet was not as in England a holy and exalted being, one set apart by his
high calling, throned in the hearts of the people, cherished by kings and nobles, one on
whom no wealth and honour are too great to shower, but one of the people themselves,
of no greater consequence than any other. Every man was an artist in so far as he was
a man; and every man being equally so in nature, whether in achievement or not
mattered nothing, as appreciation was of no moment. Accomplishing Art for the sake
of Art, the interest of the creator of the work died with its creation. It may therefore
be possible that these words are those of poetic exaggeration, or that there is a
concealed meaning in them, or that they are intended to mask and mislead, or that the
poet himself was not fully instructed. Indeed it is certain that only the High House
had the secrets of Atlas, and that the magicians of that House held the undeniable if
sometimes dangerous doctrine that the truth and falsehood of a statement alternated as
do day and night according to the status of the hearer of the statement. However, so
strong is the tradition concerning the `Angel of Venus' that it must at least be
considered carefully. The theory appears to have been that if the magicians of Venus
invited the Atlanteans, means would assuredly follow, just as if a King summons a
paralysed man to his presence, he will also send officers to convey him. Now whether
the `Angel of Venus' is really an angel in anything like the modern sense of the word,
or merely a title of one of the principal magicians of that planet, it is evident that the
High House ardently desired his presence. That this might be manifested by the birth
of a child `without the stain of Atla' was clearly an ultimate desideratum, an outward
and visible sign of redemption, an obvious guarantee of the reality of the occurrence.
It was then a Virgin high priestess who achieved so notable a renown; whether or not
this is a mere poetic parable of the abiogenesis--if it indeed fair to so describe it--of
the eleventh stage of Zro is another and an open question. In any case, such is the
tradition, and numerous parodies of it are still extant in the stories of the births of
Romulus and Remus, Bacchus, Buddha and many other legendary heroes of modern
times; we even catch an echo in the myths of such barbarous lands as Syria.

So much and no more concerning the Underground Gardens of Atlas, and of their
commerce with the inhabitants of Venus.

 OF MARRIAGE AND OTHER CURIOUS CUSTOMS OF THE ATLANTEANS;
                        AND OF SACRIFICES TO THE GODS

I have already adverted to that most singular conception of the duty of the married
which opposes the customs of Atlas to those of any other race on earth. But the
considerations which established it have yet to be discussed. I will not insist on that
gross and cynical view which might perceive in English marriage today a practical
vindation of the Atlantean position. On the contrary, in Atlas marriage formed the
loftiest of ideals. It resembled the "Hermetic marriage" of certain alchemists. The
bond between the parties was onl stronger for the absence of the lower link. The idea
underlying this was in the main a particular case of the general proposition that
whatever was natural should be transcended. As will be seen in the final chapter, the
very stigma of success in their Great Work was the transcending of the sexual process.
The bond of marriage was not, however, entirely of this negative character. It had its
positive side, and here closely resembled the so-called Christian doctrine of Christ and
the church. Husband and wife were to be father and daughter, mother and son, brother
and sister, teacher and pupil, and above all, friends. And this relation was to subsist
on all planes. The hieroglyph of love was a cross; that of marriage, parallel straight
lines, and as the cross was to be transcended in the circle, so were these lines to
converge not on earth, but in Venus. In the meanwhile each partner led his own free
life; and it often occurred that a woman, having borne two children to a man and
married him, would bear to children to another man, and so on for perhaps two
centuries, thus acquiring a cohort of husbands. Such an arrangement must clearly
have led to grave confusion had any question of property and inheritance been
involved, but notions so unfortunate were unknown. Where all had every heart's
desire, of what value were they? It is true that some division of labour (though little)
was involved in the social scheme, but it occurred to no one to regard the supervision
of the serviles as less honourable than the offering of the great sacrifices. In a perfect
organism one part is as necessary and decent as any other part, and no sane observer
can reason otherwise. For a perfect organism has a single definite aim, and the only
dishonourable feather on an arrow would be one that was out of place. Human nature
being what it is, one may nevertheless agree that this measureless content with the
existing order, except insofar as the purpose of the establishment of that order was
unfulfilled, was rendered possibly by the extreme lightness of the toil demanded of
any individual. But it is impossible for slaves to understand free men. It is always a
wonder to Englishmen that a man should devote himself to unremitting toil for an
ideal. He is called a crank, basely slandered, the lowest motives being without any
reason assigned to his actions, mocked, persecuted, perhaps crucified. This is partly
forgiveable, as in England philanthropy is almost invariably the mask of vice and
fraud.

                                  THE LOST CONTINENT
The ceremony of marriage* was simple, dignified, yet poignant. The lovers in the
presence of their whole house, publicly embraced for the last time. Their two children
pressed them apart. Elevating their hands in a crossed clasp they gave way, and the
children passed trhough, preceding a most holy image which was borne by a priest and
priestess between them. They then parted, and each was severally congratulated and
embraced by any of the others who chose, and the priest and priestess then, exalting
the image and setting in a suitable shrine, closed the ceremony by the command "To
work" and adding force to the same by their example.

The education of the children was another important matter in which their ideas were
wholly opposed to our own. It ceased altogether at the age of puberty, which was
sometimes as early as six, never later than fourteen.             Were it so delayed, the
delinquent was crowned in mockery with a square black cap, sometimes tasselated,
and sent among the serviles to instruct them in religion and similar branches of
learning, and never permitted to return to Atlas. The ignorance and superstition of the
plains was thus kept at a proper height.

The method of education was indeed singular. Certain Atlanteans who made it their
study would place various articles in the hands of infants, and observe what use they
made of them. In the course of a few months the experts had accurately mapped the
psychology of the child, and it was led in accordance therewith. The marriage
customs of Atlas allowed no too rapid growth in numbers, and it was therefore easy to
give each child attention. The method of opposition was again employed in education,
the child's natural wish being constantly stimulated by a parallel training in the
contrary subject.     Children were also shown a series of ordered facts, and an
explanation given. But not the least pain was taken to ascertain whether the child had
retained those instructions. They were left as impressions on the mind. The brain was
not injured by the strain of being constantly forced to bring up its stores from
subconsciousness. It was found in practice that every child learnt everything that it
was shown, and that this learning was always ready for use, while the consciousness
was never wearied and overcrowed. It was also found that those whose memories
were what we call good were precisely those who failed to develop in other ways
more useful to society.

The most peculiar of all their methods was the search for genius. It was the business
of the experts to pay the most serious and reverent attention to all that a child did, and
whenever they failed to understand the workings of its mind, to place it under the
charge of a special guardian, who did his utmost to comprehend sufficiently to be able
to encourage it to become yet more unintelligible.

*There was also the marriage of those of the Magicians who refused all intercourse with the
opposite sex, and were therefore married to the whole sex as such. Here was no ceremony used;
but each had a special mark signifying that he or she was thus consecrated.

sicut imagines homonculorum fuere. Lege--Judica--Tace.*

Many of the men had ossified extensions of the frontal process which amounted to
horns, and the same formation was occasionally found in the higher types of women.
Curiously carven headdresses of gold were worn by both sexes, and those of priestly
rank adorned them with living serpents and the high priests yet further with feathers or
with wings, such being not the spoils of dead birds, but the blossoms of the live gold
of the crowns. Some tradition of this custom is found in the pictures of the `Gods' of
Egypt, these gods being merely the Atlanteans whose mission civilized the country.
The names of some of the earlier gods confirm this. Nu (Heb. Noah) is Atlantean for
arch, Zu (Egypt. Shu) for many ideas connecting with wind, Asi means `cunnus quasi
serpens', obviously the name of an actual High Priestess. Ra is pure Atlantean for
Sun, and 'Mse (Egyptian Chomse) for moon. The idea in 'Mse is that of a strong
woman ('M) closing the mouth of a serpent (S) or dragon, and from this we have the
XIth card of the Bohemian Tarot, and the legend in the Apocalypse. In the mystic
Greek used by the Gnostics we find similar traces, SOFIA being from S Ph, giving the
idea of `serpent breath', i.e. wisdom. I A O is Falloj, Kteij, Prwktoj. The word
LOGOS means the Boy (g) naturally engendered of the Virgin (l) and the serpent (s).
QEOS (root Q, first written !) means the sun in his strength and also Lingam-Yoni
conjoined. CRISTOS is "The love of passion of the Rising Sun (R) and the serpent
(S). The I and T indicate certain details which are foreign to the present discussion.
NEUMA (Atlantean N M) is the `Arch of the Woman'. MARIA, the Woman of the
Sun, the words MEIQRAS and ABRAXAS are again derived from Atlas. "The
women entered, Lingam being conjoined with the Yoni, bears the sun from her serpent
womb" and "From the womb's mouth the Sun (coming seeketh) a womb for his
desire, even the womb of a serpent", the course of the year being signified in this
manner, as usual with the ancients. This plan of an idea corresponding to each letter
was carried out very strictly; thus TLA, black, means the stigma or mark of the
virgin's womb, IA (Hail!           Greeting!) `face to face', from the other peculiarity
described above.§ These few examples will suffice to indicate the singular character
of the language,** and the way in which its essential dogmatic symbols have been
incorporated by the heirs of Atlas in the inmost sanctuaries of races which they
deemed worthy of such assistance.

I must not pass over in silence the question of the sacrifices to the gods, to which a
passing reference has already been made. Such sacrifices were not very frequent; the
victims were the `failures', those who were useless to the social economy.* As they
represented capital expenditure, the object was to recover this, at least, since no
interest could be expected. This victim was therefore handed over to a High Priest, or
Priestess, who extracted the life by an instrument devided for and excellently adapted
to the purpose, so that it died by exhaustion. The life thus regained was given to `the
gods' in a manner to complex to describe in this brief account.

The early age at which puberty occurred was due to design. The normal period of
gestation had also been shortened to four months. This was all part of the scheme to
economize time. Old age had been almost done away with by the great readiness of
the Atlanteans to `go and see' at the first sign of failing power. No doubt, further
improvements would have been made but for the loss of interest in the matter, all
generation being regarded as `the old experiment', not likely to repay the trouble of
further research. In the 200 or 300 years of man's full vigour, only 8 years on an
average was the wastage of childhood, and even this was not all waste, since some
time at least must be necessary for the experts to discover and train the tendencies of
the mind. The body ought therefore to be regarded as an engine, the theoretical limit
of whose efficiency had been reached.

So much I mention of the customs of the Atlanteans with regard to marriage,
education, and religious sacrifices.




* I must revert for a moment to the language. OIK, Greek 'Oikas, meant the `House of the
penetrating men.' NOM, Greek Nomos, the `arch of the House of the Women' i.e. that which
roofed them in or protected them. Hence `the law.'

                                           VIII
        OF THE HISTORY OF ATLAS, FROM ITS EARLIEST ORIGINS TO
        THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CATASTROPHE

The origin of Atlas is lost in the obscurity of antiquity.        The official religious
explanation is this "We came across (under) the waters on the living Atla", which is
pious but improbable. A mystic meaning is to be suspected. The lay historian says
"We came, escaping from destruction, eight persons in a ship, bearing the living Zro."
This reminds one of later legends of presumably equal value. Poets frankly claim
"We descended from heaven," and it has been seriously urged that seafarers would
have preferred to plains to the rocks. The law of contrariety to Nature explains this
away. Others maintain that the earliest settlers came `by air', or, `through air'. This
must mean balloons or aeroplanes, as flying was not known till centuries after. What
is definitely known is that the earliest settlers were of a purely fighting race. An
Atlantean Homer, Ylo, has described the first battle in such detail as to leave no doubt
that he is retelling facts--a marked contradiction to his earlier books. There appear to
have been but a few Atlanteans, unless the names given are those of chiefs, which
internal evidence controverts. Their valour seems to have been prodigious. The
natives were armed with every possible instrument of precision, having cavalry and
artillery in abundance, as well as weapons that must have been as superior to the
modern rifle (unless Ylo exaggerates) as that is to the arquebus. In spite of this the
men of Atlas `smote them with rods' or `fell upon them with their cones', and routed
them utterly. This mention of rods and cones has absurdly suggested to commentators
that the Atlanteans used their eyes, and hypnotized the enemy. To state such an
opinion is sufficient to expose its author to the contempt of the thoughtful. Altogether
86 battles were fought, extending over 5 years, before the natives were induced to sue
for peace. This was granted on generous terms, which the colonists broke, as soon as
they dared to do so, in accordance with the invariable practice of colonists, then as
much as today. However, it was nigh on a hundred years before the first college of
magic was established. Previously the Atla had been carried about as occasion
demanded. It was now enshrined with some decency of ceremonial upon a mountain.
About three hundred years later we find ourselves face to face with the first great
Mystery of Atlas. This is a translation of the record of that most strange event.

"Now it came to pass that all men turned black and died, and that the living Alta abode
alone, bearing Mercury, whereof the Sun knoweth. Thus came again the true men of
Atlas, and their women, bearing gods and goddesses. And the void suffered nothing,
and the earth was at peace. Now then indeed arose Art, and men builded, being blind.
And there was light, and the scar of light wrought mischief. Therefore the wise men
destroyed them with their magic, and there is no record because it is written in that
which now is." A sort of "Si monumentum quaeris, circumspice" seems here implied.
In any case there were clearly two gaps unbridgeable between the early struggles of
the settlers, the period of great buildings, and the modern period, which proved stable,
of `houses.' The `houses' were only made possible by the perfecting of Zro, and this
helps considerably to fix the date. The next 2500 years were years of peaceable

progress; the labour mills were run without a hitch, and the next event was the
discovery of black phosphorus. It had been the custom to worship the Atla with lights,
and these lights had been candles of yellow phosphorus in golden sheathes. At that
time the Atla was veiled. At one festival of Spring the veils were burnt up, the lights
extinguished, and the yellow phosphorus was found to have been turned into the black
powder. The magicians examined this, and brought Zro to its ninth stage. This
revolutionized the condition of things: old age and disease were no more, and death
voluntary. Strangely enough this led directly to the Great Conspiracy.

At the end of this period of 2500 years the system of `houses' was well established.
There were over 400 such `houses', each of perhaps 1000 souls on average. These
were governed by 4 `houses of houses' whose rulers took orders from the High House,
at the head of which was the living Atla. The plain principle of Atlas was revolution;
and like all revolutionary bodies, was obliged to adopt the stricted form of autocracy.
A democracy is always soddenly conservative. The only hope is to catch it in one of
its moments of crazy enthusiasm, and crush it before it has time to recover. Caesar
and Napolean both did this so fars as they could; Cromwell and Perfiric Diaz did the
same within narrower limits.

Now a certain sophist--for philosopher one cannot call him--tried to enunciate a
magical law to the effect that the present standard of life was all that could be desired;
that further progress would be harmful, that Venus was not worth attaining, and that
the sole endeavour of the magicians should be to preserve things as they were. That
such a proposition could be supposed a `law' reflects no credit on its author or its
supporters. Yet of these it found many. The ninth stage of Zro was a leap calculated
to unsettle the calmest mind. Its reality had beggared the optimist's daydream. Poets
had thrown down their stilettos.* High Priests who had spent decades in hopeful
experiment saw their results attained by an entirely different method. In short, two
thirds of the people were infected with the heresy, and hoped to hear it promulgated as
a Law of Magic.

It should here be explained that every Law of Magic had its turn as the principal law
of practical working, and the school supporting any law, or insisting on it, became
prominent with it.     Every dominant law in all history had always been made
insignificant by a new discovery about Zro, or other matter of practical importance,
just as the `Peace with Honour' battle-cry of Disraeli was drowned by the calculation
of the cost of warships, soldiers and patriotism. Each step in Zro had consequently
implied the rise to power of a new school; and the sophist was ambitious, and yet the
law he wished to establish was the ruling law of the servile races.

The `law' was accordingly sent to the High House for approval. Some opposition may
have been foreseen, but no one was prepared fro the blackness of disapproval which
actually radiated, striking hearts cold. A course without precedent, no answer was
vouchsafed.      On the contrary, even normal communication was suspended. The
houses which favoured the innovation--333 in number--took counsel, came to the
decision that it was useless to oppose the High House, and were about to acquiesce

when a woman who had once been in the presence of `To Her' rose and thought
vehemently `The Living Atla is the head of our conspiracy.' In other words, they
were the loyalists, the magicians of the High House the rebels. This was why they had
cut themselves off, because their own head was against them. It was instantly
resolved to go to the High House, and demand the custody of `To Her.' Nearing the
goal, however, a remnant of the ancient reverence half cowed even the ringleaders--I
may mention that five of every six of the heretics were women--when they saw a
stern phalanx of magicians, its point threatening their centre. As they wavered, a
woman cried "They are only men such as we are." The ranks stiffened; on all sides
the army closed upon the tiny phalanx, which only numbered 56 all told. It was then
that the truth was known. Ere a blow could be struck, the attacking party vanished; it
was instantaneous and complete annihilation. From that moment it was certain that
the ruling power in Atlas was Something* infinitely more awful than even the living
Atla. In order to avoid any possible repetition of such a disaster--for the Magicians of
the High House knew that any manifestation of the Supreme must unto the work of
centuries--they gave out that they had become too terrible to look upon, and for the
future they always appeared with heavy veils, or rather masks, since for the most part
they were carven fantastically by the wearers in the leisure hours. A further alteration
was made in the system of government. The head of one of the `houses of houses'
was made supreme: the High House took no part in affairs of state. Thus the Atla was
to all intents and purposes deposed, although the same reverence and sacrifice were
paid to it as formerly. It became a `constitutional monarch', in our modern jargon.

The next thousand years were years of serious trial in other ways. The toil of
repopulation was excessive, and there was a revolt or rather strike of the servile races,
which was ended by the substitution of `bread from heaven' for those products of the
earth on which they had formerly been fed, a diet which proved so adapted to their
nature that no labour trouble ever recurred.

The Greek legends of the wars between Gods, giants, Titans are traditions of a real
was or series of wars which continued with intervals for over 200 years. The enemy
had developed naval armament to an extreme. Their tactices were these:

    1.    To wipe out the servile races and so interfere with the production of Zro.
    2.    To rush and destroy the High House.

The first of these men with a great deal of success, the floating rock being struck with
projectiles and sunk. This occrred chiefly on the outlying islands, where they were not
too much afraid to make raids in force. They also sent epidemic diseases of many
kinds. Atlas was reduced to such extremity in these ways that at one time the
waterways were forced and the assault on the High House was actually carried out,
bombardment continuing day and night for months together.                          Through a
misunderstanding of a well known magical law, Atlanteans at that time considered
themselves prohibited from employing any other defence than the rods and the cones
of their forefathers; and these, it appears, were useless against machinery, or against

men protected by fortification in such a way that they could not be got at from any
quarter. Thus the sharklike submarines of the enemy were unassailable. The war was
therefore at first entirely one-sided. A certain youthful magician, however, resolving
to die for his country if need were, decided to retaliate. He had found that Zro in its
nascent state (i.e. between the globes) had the power of bringing about endothermic
reaction, seawater for example becoming caustic soda and hydrochloric acid; and
further that this acid thus produced was many thousand times more active that in its
normal state. For example, the rock basin in which he conducted his first experiment
dissolved as rapidly as butter under boiling oil. He then prepared a number of pairs of
receiver-globes, and dropped them in the vicinity of the enemy's submarines by night.
In this manner he destroyed the hulls of almost the whole fleet in a single night; and
the remainder fled in panic at dawn. They returned the following year, carrying out
daylight raids only and devoting themselves to destroying the labourmills. The young
magician had been rewarded for his services by being presented to the Atla, and this
example encouraged others to find means of attacking the invaders.              Artificial
darkness was therefore invented, and combined with the former method; but this was
only partially successful, the tremendous pace of the `sharks' enabling them to evade
any threatening clouds. They did enormous damage, and the supplies of Zro were
seriously curtailed. Things now went from bad to worse, and culminated in the attack
on the High House, the besiegers keeping their battleships surrounded by rafts of fire,
so that attack was impossible even by night. It was then that the High House called on
the heroism of its sons. Armed with long swords of Zro, they plunged into the sea, to
perish indeed under the tooth of the Zhee-Zhou, but not before they had time to hack
the invading battleships to shreds. Their floating torch-rafts only assisted the attack by
directing the swimmers to their quarry. The attack on the High House had roused
Atlas at last. A counter invasion was plotted and carried out with immediate and
complete success, the enemy being exterminated, and their country not merely
ravaged but destroyed by arousing the forces of earthquake. All activity of this kind
being however deprecable, a recurrence was guarded against by removing the High
House to the lofty mountain previously described, and a `house' was chosen to
cultivate the art of war, and entrusted with the duty of destroying any living thing that
might approach within a hundred miles of Atlas.

Only one other adventure of historical importance remains to be recorded. It is the
attempt of some foolish Atlanteans to found an `Empire', and so to be entirely
distinguished from the missionary effort referred to previously.           The original
settlement of Atlas, as has been the case with all flourishing colonies, was made by a
few hardy pioneers, who strengthened themselves by growth.            But Atlas in her
momentary madness poured out blood and treasure in the fatuous attempt to impose
alien domination on lands utterly unsuited to the genius of the people. The idea, of
course, was to increase the supply of labour and consequently the output of crude Zro.
In the first place the adventure was expensive. It was uneconomical (in the scientific
sense) to send ships with less than 1000 fighting men. The Zro required for these
meant the employment of at least 7000 serviles, and naval construction was therefore
of a colossal order. But although little difficulty was found in conquering the country
in the military sense, the natives had to be almost exterminated, and the labour of the

survivors proved difficult to enforce. It was even then not a tenth as efficient as that
of the serviles at home. The imported serviles moreover caught native diseases, and
died in hundred; and though by prodigious sacrifices the East African Empire was
kept going for nearly 200 years, it had to end at last no less ingloriously than the
French adventure in Mexico, or the English in India, Egypt and South Africa.*

The main cause was the impossibility of breeding children in a climate so unsuitable,
even of maintaining their own women, and above all the fact that the crude Zro was
not of quality equal to that obtained in Atlas, and that the Zro generated by the
Atlanteans themselves was not to be made at all outside their own country. The lesson
was learnt. Until the end no further attempt was made to advance in any but the true
direction.      The great majority of the colonists returned to Atlas; but many,
degenerating as is the fashion with colonists of this conquering kind, abandoned Zro
for gross food, intermarried with the natives, and have generally degenerated yet
further to races inferior even to the present descendants of those who were in those
days the equivalents of the serviles of Atlas.




*I write little, but not much, in advance of the events. To illustrate the theory here advanced I
will ask the reader to compare the results of the attempt to colonize America by (a) the whole
military power of Spain at her zenith, (b) the handful of exile in the "Mayflower."

                               OF THE CATASTROPHE;
                   ITS ANTECEDENTS AND PRESUMED CAUSES

In my remarks on Zro I gave a necessarily somewhat diffuse account of the properties
of this remarkable substance. It must now be made clearer that the crude Zro in its
nine stages produced by the serviles, and consumed in the `Houses' was in each stage
of inferior quality to that of the same degree produced by the Atlanteans, and
consumed by the High House. For example, the crude Zro was made in a labour-mill
will all sorts of insulations. The first stage of the priest's Zro could be made anywhere
and at any time, and naturally directed itself to the receptacle for it without any
precautions. It must, I think, be presumed that the Zro generated in the High House
was again of far greater purity and potency. Very little of it can have been used in the
experiments of the magicians, and it is therefore necessary to account for enormous
quantities, produced during many centuries of uninterrupted labour. I have, however,
no data of any kind for this investigation; the mysteries of the High House have ever
been inscrutable, and were not wholly delivered to the Heirs of Atlas. They must be
rediscovered by the magicians of the new race. It may be that in some form or other
the Zro had been made stable, and used to impregnate the column which is alleged to
have been driven `through the earth'; perhaps, and less improbably, only to the depth
of a few hundred miles. This column, however long it may have been, had certainly
its top immediately below the reservoir of the High House. It had been completed
about 70 years before the `catastrophe' but apparently no attempt was made to utilize
it in any way.       To me it appears probably that in some one mind the whole
`catastrophe' was brooding, that the column was part of the device, and that the event
which I shall now describe was the other part.

This event was the birth of a child in the High House, a child without the
distinguishing mark of the daughters of Atlas. That any child at all should have been
born there is so incredible that I am inclined to suspect an improper use of the word
`born.' I think rather that a magician brought Zro to its eleventh stage, when it takes
human form, and lives! The alternative theroy is that of the `Angel of Venus',
described in the chapter on the underground Gardens of Atlas. The supporters of this
theory hold that the child was not born of a priestess, but of the living Atla.

In any case, the whole country gave itself to unbridled rejoicing. Work was carried on
at a greater speed than ever before: one might say a delerium of labour. For eleven years
this continued without cessation, and then without warning came the order to repair to
the High House--every man, woman and child of Atlas. What was then done I know
not, and dare not guess; that same day seven volunteers, heroic exiles from the reward
of so many centuries of toil, voluntary maroons on the discarded planet, the Heirs of
Atlas, turned their faces from the High House, and severally sought distant mountains,
there each to guard his share of the Secrets of the Holy Race, and in due time to
discover and train up fit children of other races of the earth so that one day another
people might be founded to undertake another such task as that now ended.

Hardly had the pinnacle of Atlas melted into the sea behind them, than the
`catastrophe' occurred. The High House and the column beneath it, with all the
inhabitants of Atlar, shot from the earth with the vehemence of a million lightnings,
bound for that green blaze of glory that scintillated in the West above the sunset.

Instantly the Earth, its god departed, gave itself up to anguish. The sea rushed into the
void of the column and in a thousand earthquakes Atlas, `houses' and plains together
were overwhelmed for ever in the ocean. Tidal waves rolled round the world;
everywhere great floods carried away villages and towns; earthquakes rocked and
tempest roared; tumult was triumphant. For years after the catastrophe the dying
tremors of the Event still shook mankind with fear.* And the eternal waves of the
great mother rolled over Atlas, save where Earth in her agony thrust up gaunt
pinnacles, bare masts of wreckage to mark the vanished continents. Save for its heirs,
of whose successors it is my highest honour to be the youngest and least worthy,
oblivion fell, like one last night in which the sun should be for ever extinct, upon the
land of Atlas and its people.

Shall such high purpose fail of emulation, such achievement not example and excite us
to like striving? Then let earth fall indeed from her high place in heaven, and mankind
be outcast for ever from the sun! Men of Earth! seek out the heirs of Atlas; let them
order you into a phalanx, let them build you into a pyramid, that may pierce that
appointed which awaits you, to establish a new dynasty of Atlanteans to be the
mainstay and mainspring of the earth, the pioneers of their own path to heaven, and to
our lord and Father, the Sun! And he put his hand under his thigh, and swore it.

By the ineffable .......tla, and by the holy Zro, did he swear it, and entered into the
body of the new Atla that is alive upon the earth.
