The hanging gardens of Babylon. R., the House of the Lady Astarte; L., a gateway; C., a broad lawn
enriched with clustered flowers and sculptures. The sun is nigh his setting. On a couch under the
wall of the city reposes the Lord Esarhaddon, fanned by two slaves, a negro boy and a fair Kabyle
girl, clad in yellow and blue, the boy's robes being covered with a veil of silver, the girl's with a veil
of gold.

                     The sun has stained his mouth with blood.

            I dreamed of thee!
            Dreams beyond form and name!
ESARHADDON  It was a chain of ages, and a flash
            Of lightning -- which thou wilt -- since -- Oh I see
            Nothing, feel nothing, and am nothing -- ash
            Of the universe burnt through!
ASTARTE     And I the flame!
            Wreathing and roaring for an ageless aeon,
            Wrapping the world, spurning the empyrean,
            Drowning with dark despotic imminence
            All life and light, annihilating sense --
ESARHADDON  I have been sealed and silent in the womb
            Of nothingness to burst, a babe's bold bloom,
            Into the upper aethyr of thine eyes.
            Oh! one grave glance enkindles Paradise,
            One sparkle sets me on the throne above,
            Mine orb the world.
            Nay, stir not yet. Let love
            Breathe like the zephyr on the unmoved deep,
            Sigh to awakening from its rosy sleep;
            Let the stars fade, and all the east grow grey
ASTARTE     And tender, ere the first faint rose of day
            Flush it. Awhile! Awhile! There's crimson bars
            Enough to blot the noblest of the stars,
            And bow for adoration ere the rim
            Start like God's spear to ware the world of Him!

ASTARTE     With an eyelash first!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
ESARHADDON Treasure and torture!
           Tantalising thirst
ASTARTE    Makes the draught more delicions. Heaven were worth
           Little without the purgatory, earth!
ESARHADDON You make earth heaven.

ASTARTE    And heaven hell. To choose thee
           Is to interpret misery "To lose thee."
ESARHADDON Ay! death end all if it must end thy kiss!
ASTARTE    And death be all if it confirm life's bliss!
ESARHADDON And death come soon if death fill life's endeavour!
ASTARTE    and if it spill life's vintage, death come never!
ESARHADDON The sun sets. Bathe me in the rain of gold!
           These pearls that decked it shimmering star-cold
ASTARTE    Fall, and my hair falls, wreathes an aureole.
           Even as thy love encompasses my soul!
           I am blinded; I am bruised; I am stung.
ESARHADDON Each thread
           Hisses.
ASTARTE    There's life there for a thousand dead!
ESARHADDON And death there for a million!
           Even so.
ASTARTE    Life, death, new life, a web spun soft and slow
           by love, the spider, in these palaces
           That taketh hold.
ESARHADDON Take hold.
           Keen joyaunces
           Mix with the multitudinous murmurings,
ASTARTE    And all the kisses sharpen into stings.
           Nay! shall my mouth take hold? Beware! Once fain,
           How shall it ever leave thy mouth again?
ESARHADDON Why should it?
ASTARTE    Is not sleep our master yet?
ESARHADDON Why must we think when wisdom would forget?
ASTARTE    Lest we in turn forget to fill the hour.
ESARHADDON The pensive been leaves honey in the flower.

ASTARTE    Now the sun's rim is dipped. And thus I dip
           My gold to the horizon of thy lip.
ESARHADDON Ah! ...
ASTARTE    There's no liquor, none, within the cup.
           Nay, draw not back; nay, then, but lift me up.
ESARHADDON I would the cup were molten too; I'd drain
           Its blasting agony.
ASTARTE    In vain.
           In vain?
ESARHADDON Nay, let the drinker and the draught in one
           Blaze up at last, and burn down Babylon!

ASTARTE    All but the garden, and our bed, and -- see!
           The false full moon that comes to rival me.

                   The gilded curves of Tigris. She's the swan

                   Their passion to his glades of emerald,

                   And trample life, fill death's sardonyx urn
                   With loves immortal -- how shall I endure

                   Her foot flits on the marble. ... Open, gate!
[The gate, not of the house but of the garden, opens. The Lady Psyche appears. She is clothed in
deep purple, as mourning, and her hair is bound with a fillet of cypress and acacia. She is attended
by three maidens and three aged women.

PSYCHE             white hour of fate!
                   I have found him!

                   I thought I had found the lord I seek.
PSYCHE             Your pardon, lord. These eyes are weary and weak
                   With tears and my vain search.
ESARHADDON         Whom seek you then?

PSYCHE             My husband -- my sole miracle of men,
                   The Count Adonis.

PSYCHE             You know of him?

ESARHADDON         I cannot tell what struck me so.
                   I never heard the name.

           Weak cheek of modesty?

PSYCHE     Oh, pardon me!
           I did not mean to move you thus.

ESARHADDON I am stirred
           Too easily. You used a shameful word!
           Accept my sorrow. I am all alone
           In this black night. My heart is stone,
           My limbs are lead, mine eyes accurst,
           My throat a hell of thirst. ...
           My husband -- they suppose him dead. ...

           At the first glance -- for now, i'faith, 'tis gone! --

ESARHADDON My life's not yesterday and not to-morrow.
           I live; I know no more.
PSYCHE     How so?
           I fear
           I know but this, that I'm a stranger here.
ESARHADDON The call me the Lord Esarhaddon -- name
           Borrowed or guessed, I cannot tell! I came
           Whence I know not -- some malady
           Destroyed my memory.

PSYCHE     Oh, were you he! But yet I see you are not.
           Had you no tokens from the life forgot?
           Nay, I came naked into Babylon.
           I live the starlight and sleep through the sun.
ESARHADDON I am happy in love, I am rich, I eat and drink,
           I gather goods, I laugh, I never think.
           Know me the prince of perfect pleasure!
           Yet
PSYCHE     Is there not something that you would forget?
           some fear that chills you? While you talk to me
           I see you glance behind you fearfully.

ESARHADDON (with furtive fear amounting to horror)
           You see the Shadow?
           No: slim shadows stretch
PSYCHE     From yonder moon, and woo the world, and tech
           With their fantastic melancholy grotesques
           The earth -- man's destiny in arabesques.
ESARHADDON You are blind! You are mad! See where he stands!

           From his eyes and nostrils to his lips
           That he sucks, gnashing his fangs. Upon
           His head is a crown of skulls, and monkeys new

           Quack! Quack! there's ducks and devils on his back.

           Well, there's a king for you to-day.
ESARHADDON Go, kiss him! Slobber over him! HIs ribs
           Should be readily tickled. Wah! Wah! Wah! she jibs.
           Ugh! there he came too close. I'll bite the dust;
           I'll lick the slime of Babylon. Great lust,
           Great god, great devil, gar-gra-gra-gra! Space me!

           So mumbling near; black blood's on everything.
           Boo! Scow! Be off! Out! Vanish! Fly! Begone!
           Out! Off! Out! Off! I'm King of Babylon.

           Your body! Clubs to mash your face in! Knives
           To cut away your cat's nine lives!
           (Entering hastily.) What's this? Who are
           you? What right have you to come
ASTARTE    And make this havoc in the home?
           Can you not see what wreck your tempest makes?
           Begone! I have a fiery flight of snakes

PSYCHE     Adonis!

ESARHADDON Ah!
           Astarte, there's some sorcery abroad.
           The spell is broken, dear my lord.
ASTARTE    There is a wall of ebony and steel
           About us.

ESARHADDON What then do I feel
           When that name sounds?
           A trick of mind.
           Things broken up and left behind
ASTARTE    Keep roots to plague us when we least expect them.
           The wise -- and thou art wise -- let naught affect them.
           Let us to feast!
           Ah no! I tremble still,
           Despite my reason and despite my will.
           Let me lie with thee here awhile, and dream
           Upon thine eyes beneath the moon,
           Whose slanted beam
           Lights up thy face, that sends its swoon
           Of languour and hunger through
ESARHADDON The infinite space that severs two
           So long as they cannot rise above
           Into the unity of love.
           However close lock hands and feet,
           One lone moment may they meet;
           When in the one pang that runs level
           With death and birth, the royal revel,
           The lover and the loved adore
           The thing that is, when they are not.
           No more!
           Bury thy face between these hills that threat
ASTARTE    The heaven, their rosy spears (the gods that fret)
           Tipping thine ears, and with my hair I'll hide thee;
           And these mine handmaidens shall stand beside thee,
           And mix their nightingale with lion

Onyx, alabaster, porphyry and malachite are the pillars; and the floor of mosaic. In the high seat is
ASTARTE, on her right HERMES, A Greek physician. He is a slight, old man, with piercing eyes
and every mark of agility and vigour. His dress is that of a Babhlonish physican.

HERMES            And now, polite preliminaries past,
                  Tell me, dear lady, what the little trouble is!
ASTARTE           It was quite sudden.
                  Good; not like to last.
HERMES            It bursts, such malady a brittle bubble is!
                  How is the pulse? Allow me!

ASTARTE           Not for me
                  Your skill. My husband's lost his memory.
HERMES            Yet he remembers you?
ASTARTE           O quite, of course!
                  Let it alone! don't flog the willing horse!
HERMES            Were I to cure him by my magic spells,
                  The odds are he'd remember someone else!
ASTARTE           Ah, but -- a month ago -- a woman came --
HERMES            Cool -- warm -- hot -- now we're getting near the flame!
ASTARTE           And what she said or did who knows?
HERMES            These men!
                  Yes! But he's never been the same since then!
ASTARTE           I've taken endless trouble not to fret him,
                  Done everything I could to please and pet him,
                  And now this wretched woman has upset him!
HERMES            Was he distressed much at the time?
                  Distressed?
ASTARTE           Mad as an elephant in spring!
                  HERMES. I guessed
                  It. Think he took a fancy to the girl?
                  Well, honestly, I don't. My mind's a whirl
ASTARTE           With worry. She's a flimsy creature, rags
                  Of sentiment, and tears, and worn-out tags
                  Of wisdom.

HERMES            Yes, you've nothing much to fear
                  While you appear as ... what you do appear.
                  Well, there they stood, crying like butchered swine,
                  She and her maids. It seems she's lost her man,
ASTARTE           Can't get another, wanted to claim mine.
                  I put a stopper on the pretty plan.
                  But ever since -- well, I can't say what's wrong,
                  But something's wrong.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
HERMES        Yes; yes. Now is it long?
ASTARTE       About a month.
HERMES        What physic have you tried?
              The usual things; young vipers skinned and dried
              And chopped with rose-leaves; cow's hoof stewed in dung,
ASTARTE      One pilule four times daily, on the tongue;
             Lark's brains in urine after every meal,
             With just a touch of salt and orange-peel.
HERMES       And yet he is no better?
             NOt a whit.
             Oh yes, though, not I come to think of it,
ASTARTE      Snails pounded up and taken after food
             Did seem to do some temporary good.
             Of course we kept him on a doubled diet.
HERMES       Have you tried change of air, and rest, and quiet?
ASTARTE      No; what a strange idea!
             As strange as new.
             Yet there seems somehow something in it too!
HERMES       Still, here's where silence is worth seven speeches --
             I might get strangled by my brother leeches.
             Now, are you sure you want him cured?

ASTARTE      Why, yes,
             Why should I call you in?

HERMES       But none the less
             It might be awkward his remembering more.
ASTARTE      I simply want him as he was before.

HERMES       And if it should turn out, as I suspect,
             He was this woman's husband.
             Then select
ASTARTE      A -- you know -- something suitable -- to put her
             Where she won't worry me, or want a suitor.

HERMES       I understand you; but I'm old; your beauty
             Might fail to make me careless of my duty.
ASTARTE      I'll take the risk.
             Then let me see the victim;
             If bound, we'll loosen him; if loose, constrict him.
HERMES       There, madam, in one phrase from heart to heart,
             Lies the whole mystery of the healer's art!
             Where is the pathic?

ASTARTE      Hush! in Babylon
             We say "the patient."
HERMES       Yes?
             It's often one.
ASTARTE      for Babylonish is so quaint a tongue
             One often goes too right by going wrong!
             I'll call him from the garden.
[Goes out.
             (alone). Is there need
HERMES       To see the man? He's simply off his feed.
             A child could see the way to make him hearty:
_____________________________________________________________________________________
            More exercise, less food -- and less Astarte!
[Enter
ESARHADDON.
            I greet your lordship.
ESARHADDON  Greeting, sir!
            And so
           We're not as healthy as a month ago?
HERMES     The pulse? Allow me! Ah! Tut! Tut! Not bad.
           The tongue? Thanks! Kindly tell me what you had
           For dinner.

ESARHADDON Nothing: practically nothing.
           I seem to look on food with utter loathing.
HERMES     Just so; but you contrived to peck a bit?
           Only a dozen quails upon the spit,
ESARHADDON A little sturgeon cooked with oysters, wine,
           Mushrooms and crayfish. ...
HERMES     That is not to dine.

ESARHADDON Well, after that I toyed with pheasant pasty,
           Sliced -- you know how -- with pineapple.
HERMES     Eat hasty?
           No, not at all. Well, then a sucking-pig
ESARHADDON Stuffed with grape, olive, cucumber, peach, fig,
           And lemon. Then I trifled with a curry ----
HERMES     You're sure you didn't eat it in a hurry?
           Quite sure. The curry was simplicity
           Itself -- plain prawns. Then there was -- let me see! --
           A dish of fruit, then a kid roasted whole,
ESARHADDON Some venison fried with goose-liver, a roll
           Of very tender spicy well-cooked veal
           Done up with honey, olive oil, and meal,
           Some sweets, but only three or four, and those
           I hardly touched.
HERMES     But why now?

ESARHADDON I suppose
           I wasn't hungry.
           Diagnosis right;
HERMES     A simple case of loss of appetite!
           Surely they tempted you with something else.

ESARHADDON A few live lobsters broiled within their shells.
           I ate two only.
           That explains the tongue.
           Now let me listen!
           Sound in heart and lung.
HERMES     (And I should think so!) 'Twas a sage that sung:
           "Whom the Gods love, love lobsters; they die young."
           And yet greater sage sublimely said:
           "Look not upon the lobster when it's red!"

ESARHADDON A Babylonish bard has said the same
           Of wine.
HERMES     Ah, wine now? Out with it! Die game!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
ESARHADDON   By fin and tail of great Oannes, I Am the mere model of sobriety.
HERMES       What did you drink for dinner?


ESARHADDON   Scarce a drop At any time -- four flagons, there I stop. With just a flask of barley-
             wine to top.

HERMES       Just so becomes a nobleman of sense Whose moderation errs toward
             abstinence.

ESARHADDON  Abstinence! That's the word I couldn't think of! I'm an abstainer. Everything I
            drink of Is consecrated by a melancholic Priest.
HERMES      Which prevents it being alcoholic!
            Sir, you appear to understand my case As no one else has done. Appalling face
ESARHADDON  These quack have that crowd Babylon. Your fee? Though none can pay the
            service done to me.
            One moment. What about your memory? Well, never mind, just follow my advice;
            That will come back before you say "knife" twice. First, fire your slaves, the
            rogues that thieve and laze: A slave's worse than two masters now-a-days. Next,
HERMES      live on nothing but boiled beans and ripe, With once a week a melon -- when
            they're ripe. Next, sent the Lady Astarte up the river; She looks to me to have a
            touch of liver. And you must teach your muscles how to harden, So stay at home,
            and labour in the garden!
            You damned insulting blackguard! Charlatan! Quack! Trickster! Scoundrel!
ESARHADDON  Cheating medicine-man! You ordure-tasting privy-sniffing rogue, You think
            because your humbug is thevogue You can beard me?
HERMES      I'll tell you just one thing. Disobey me, and -- trouble with the King!
            Ring-a-ling-ting! Ping! Spring! HERMES. That's cooked his goose. I'll tell Astarte,
ESARHADDON  though it's not much use. [He goes out. It's only one more of life's little curses --
            The best of women make the worst of nurses!
SCENE III   THE CONSULTING-ROOM OF HERMES.
            It has two parts, the first filled with stuffed crocodiles, snakes, astrolabes,
            skeletons, lamps of strange shape, vast rolls of papyri, vases containing such
            objects as a foetus, a mummied child, a six-legged sheep. Hands (obviously
            those of criminals) have been painted with phosphorus, and give light. Sculptures
            of winged bulls and bricks inscribed with arrow-head characters are ranged about
            the walls. A chain of elephant's bones covered with its hide contains the doctor,
            who is dressed as before in a long black robe covered with mysterious
            characters. On his head is a high conical cap of black silk dotted with gold stars.
            In his right hand is a wand of human teeth strung together, in his left a "book" of
            square palm-l;eaves bound in silver. at the back of the room is a black curtain
            completely veiling its second portion. This curtain is covered with cabalistic
            characters and terrifying images in white. [Enter the servant of HERMES, a negro
            uglier than an ape. He is immensely long and lean; his body hangs forward, so
            that his arms nearly touch the ground. He is clad in a tightly fitting suit of scarlet,
            and wears a scarlet skull-cap. he makes deep obeisance.]
HERMES      Speak, Hanuman!
HANUMAN     A lady. [HERMES nods gravely. Exit HANUMAN.
            Abaoth! Abraxas! Pur! Put! Aeou! Thoth! [Enter the LADY PSYCHE with one
            attendant. Ee! Oo! Uu! Iao Sabaoth! Dogs of Hell! Mumble spell! Up! Up! Up!
HERMES      Sup! Sup! Sup! U! Aoth! Abaoth! Abraoth! Sabaoth! Livid, loath, Obey the oath!
            Ah! [He shuts the book with a snap, You have come to me because you are
            crossed In love.
PSYCHE      Most true, sir!
_____________________________________________________________________________________
HERMES    Ah! you're Greek!
PSYCHE    As you yourself,sir.
          Then I've lost My pains. I need not fear to speak. I took you for a fool. Ho! veil,
          divide! [HANUMAN appears and lays his hand on a cord. Things are much
          pleasanter the other side. [The doctor throws off his cloak and cap, his straggling
HERMES    white hair and long pointed beard, appearing as a youth dressed fashionably; at
          the same time the curtain pulled back shows a room furnished with the luxury of
          a man of the world. A low balcony of marble at the back gives a view of the city,
          and of the Tigris winding far into the distance, where dim blue mountains rim the
          horizon.] [The doctor conducts his client to a lounge, where they sit.
          Bring the old Chian, Hanuman! [The negro goes to obey. This joke Is the
          accepted way of scaring folk; And if they're scared, they may find conficence
          Which is half cure. Most people have no sense. If only they would sweat, and
HERMES    wash, eat slow, Drink less, think more, the leech would starve or go. But they
          prefer debauchery, disease, Clysters, drugs, philtres, filth, and paying fees! Now
          then, to business! PSYCHE. Tell me how you guessed It was my heart that found
          itself distressed!
          I always sing a woman just that song; In twenty years I've never once been
HERMES    wrong. Seeing me thus marvellously wise, Veneration follows on surprise:
          Sometime they will do what I advise!
PSYCHE    I see. You have real knowledge.
HERMES    Not to be learnt at college!
          Good; you're my man. I am come from Greece, Were the Gods live and love us,
          sorrowing For my lost husband. I have found him here, But with his memory
PSYCHE    gone, his mind distraught, Living in luxury with a courtesan (I could forgive him
          that if he knew me), Filled with a blind unreasoning fear of what Who knows?
          He's haunted by a spectre king.
          Physicians must know everything: Half the night burn learning's candle, Half the
          day devote to scandal. Here's the mischief of the matter That I learn most from
HERMES    the latter! Yesterday I paid a visit To the fair ... Astarte, is it? Saw the kitchen and
          the closet, Deduced diet from deposit, Saw where silkworm joined with swan To
          make a bed to sleep upon, Saw the crowd of cringing knaves That have made
          their masters slaves, Saw Astarte -- diagnosed What had made him see a ghost!
PSYCHE    Can you cure him?
          In my hurry (And a not unnatural worry At the name of lobster curry) I so far
HERMES    forgot my duty As to mention to the beauty What ... well! here's the long and
          short of it! Just exactly what I thought of it. Tempests, by Oannes' fin!
PSYCHE    Sorry that he'd called you in?
HERMES    So much so that I'd a doubt If he wouldn't call me out!
PSYCHE    Then he will not hear your counsel?

HERMES    No; I bade him live on groundsel; But the little social friction Interfered with the
          prescription.
PSYCHE    There's no hope, then?

HERMES    Lend an ear! We may rule him by his fear! Somehow we may yet contrive That
          he see the King, and live! Have you influence?
PSYCHE    At Court? Plenty, in the last resort. Letters from his suzerain!
HERMES    You are high in favour then?
PSYCHE    Ay, that needs not to be sworn; I am his own daughter born.
HERMES    In thy blood the spark divine Of Olympus?
PSYCHE    Even in mine!

            Hark, then! At the Hour of Fears When the lordly Lion rears In mid-heaven his
            bulk of bane Violently vivid, shakes his mane Majestical, and Snake and Bull
            Lamp the horizon, and the full Fire of the moon tops heaven, and spurs The
            stars, while Mars ruddily burns, And Venus glows, and Jupiter Ramps through
HERMES      the sky astride of her, Then, unattended, let the king Press on the little secret
            spring That guards the garden, and entering Lay once his hand upon him, even
            While in the white arms of his heaven He swoons to sleep. That dreadful
            summons From the wild witchery his woman's. That shaft of shattering truth shall
            splinter The pine of his soul's winter. Then do thou following cry once His name;
            as from eclipse the sun's Supernal splendour springs, his sight Shall leap to light.
PSYCHE      Shall leap to light! Master, this wisdom how repay?
            I am sworn unto thy father -- Nay! Weep not and kneel not! See, mine art [The
HERMES      two other handmaidens are seen standing by their fellow.] Hath wrought such
            wonder in thine heart That -- look!

PSYCHE      Ah! Pistis, Elpis! how Are you here? You were not with me now! You fled me.
            Charis only came Through those dark dreams.

HERMES      Farewell! Proclaim For my reward my art's success. More than yourself need
            happiness.
PSYCHE      Farewell and prosper greatly! [She goes out with her maidens.

HERMES      And thou, live high and stately In gory and gree tenfold That which thou hadst of
            old! [He draws the curtain.
SCENE IV:   THE ANTECHAMBER OF THE KING'S PALACE.
            It is a vast hall of black marble. At the corners four fountains play in basins of
            coloured marble. At the back a narrow door pillared by vast man-bulls in white
            marble. In mid-stage the LADY PSYCHE, seated on the ground, her long hair
            unloosed, her robe of shining silver, mourns. With her are the three handmaidens
            bowed and mourning at front of the stage R., C., and L. the aged women are
            grouped in front of stage C., on the steps which lead to the hall. No light comes
            save through the roves of the LADY PSYCHE from the jewels that adorn her.
            Their glimmer is, however, such as to fill the hall with moony radiance, misty dim,
            and lost in the vastness of the building. PSYCHE. Silence grows hateful; hollow
            is mine heart Here in the fateful hall; I wait apart. Dimmer, still dimmer darkness
            veils my sight; There is no glimmer heralding the light. I, the King's daughter, am
            but serf and thrall Where Time hath wrought her cobweb in the hall. this blood
            avails not; where's the signet ring Whose pussiance fails not to arouse the King?
            Heir of his heart, I am uncrowned; then, one that hath no art or craft in Babylon. I
            left my home and found a vassal's house -- This lampless dome of death,
            vertiginous! O for the foam of billows that carouse About the crag-set columns!
            for the breeze That fans their flagging Caryatides! For the gemmed vestibule, the
            porch of pearl, The bowers of rest, the silences that furl Their wings upon mine
            amethystine chamber Whose lions shone with emerald and amber! O for the
            throne whereon my father's awe, Lofty and lone, lets liberty love law! All justice
            wrought, its sword the healer's knife! All mercy, not less logical than life! Alas! I
            wait a widowed suppliant Betrayed to fate, blind trampling elephant. I wait and
            mourn. Will not the dust disclose The Unicorn, the Unicorn that goes About the
            gardens of these halls of Spring, First of the wardens that defend the King? Wilt
            thou not bring me to the Unicorn? [The Unicorn passes over. He has the
            swiftness of the horse, the slimness of the deer, the whiteness of the swan, the
            horn of the narwhal. He couches upon the right side of the LADY PSYCHE.] Hail!
            thou that holdest thine appointed station, Lordliest and boldest of his habitation,
            Silence that foldest over its creation! [The Lion passes over. He is redder than
            the setting sun. He couches upon the left side of the LADY PSYCHE.] Hail! thou
            that art his ward and warrior, The brazen heart, the iron pulse of war! Up start, up
            start! and set thyself to roar! [The Peacock passes over. This peacock is so great
_____________________________________________________________________________________
            that his fan, as he spreads it on couching before the face of the LADY PSYCHE,
            fills the whole of the hall.] Hail! glory and light his majesty that hideth, Pride and
            delight whereon his image rideth, While in thick night and darkness he abideth!
            [The stage now darkens. Even the light shed by the jewels of the LADY PSYCHE
            is extinguished. then, from the gate of the Palace between the man-bulls there
            issueth a golden hawk. In his beak is a jewel which he drops into the lamp that
            hangs from the height above the head of the LADY PSYCHE. this lamp remains
            dark. During his darkness the Unicorn, the Lion, and the Peacock disappear.]
            Love me and lead me through the blind abysses! Fill me and feed me on the
            crowning kisses, Like flowers that flicker in the garden of glory, Pools of pure
            liquor like pale flames and hoary That lamp the lightless empyrean! Ah! love me!
            All space be sightless, and thine eyes above me! Thrice burnt and branded on
            this bleeding brow, Stamp thou the candid stigma -- even now! [The lamp flashes
            forth into dazzling but momentary radiance. As it goes out a cone of white light is
            seen upon the head of THE LADY PSYCHE, And before her stands a figure of
            immense height cloaked and hooded in perfect blackness.] THE KING. Come! for
            the throne is hollow. The eagle hath cried: Come away! The stars are numbered,
            and the tide Turns. Follow! Follow! Thine Adonis slumbered. As a bride Adorned,
            come, follow! Fate alone is fallen and wried. Follow me, follow! The unknown is
            satisfied. [The LADY PSYCHE is lifted to her feet. In silence she bows, and in
            silence follows him as he turns and advances to the gate while the curtain falls.]
SCENE V:    THE GARDEN OF THE LADY ASTARTE.
            THE LORD ESARHADDON is lying on the couch with his mistress. Their arms
            are intertwined. They and their slaves and maidens are all fallen into the abysses
            of deep sleep. It is a cloudless night; and the full moon, approaching mid-heaven,
            casts but the shortest shadows. The Murmur of the Breeze I am the Breeze to
            bless the bowers, Sigh through the trees, caress the flowers; Each folded bud to
            sway, to swoon, With its green blood beneath the moon Stirred softly by my kiss;
            I bear The sort reply of amber air To the exhaled sighs of the heat That dreams
            and dies amid the wheat, From the cool breasts of mountains far -- Their serried
           crests clasp each a star! The earth's pulse throbs with mighty rivers; With her low
           sobs God's heaven quivers; The dew stands on her brow; with love She aches
           for all the abyss above, Her rocks and chasms the lively strife Of her sharp
           spasms of lust, of life. Hark! to the whisper of my fan, My sister kiss to maid and
           man. Through all earth's wombs, through all sea's waves, Gigantic glooms,
           forgotten graves, I haunt the tombs of kings and slaves. I hush the babe, I wake
           the bird, I wander away beyond stars unstirred, Soften the ripples of the tide,
           Soothe the bruised nipples of the bride, Help stars and clouds play hide-and-
           seek, Wind seamen's shrouds, bid ruins speak, Bring dreams to slumber, sleep
           to dream Whose demons cumber night's extreme. And softer sped than dream or
           death Quiet as the dead, or slain love's breath, I sigh for loves that swoon upon
           The hanging groves of Babylon. Each terrace adds a shower of scent Where lass
           and lad seduce content; Each vine that hangs confirms the stress Of purer pangs
           of drunkenness; Each marble wall and pillar swerves Majestical my course to
           curves Subtle as breasts and limbs and tresses Of this caressed suave
           sorceress's That raves and rests in wildernesses Whose giant gifts are strength
           that scars Her soul and lifts her to the stars, Savage, and tenderness that tunes
           Her spirit's splendour to the moon's, And music of passion to outrun The fiery
           fashion of the sun. Hush! there's a stir not mine amid the groves, A foot divine
           that yet is not like live's. Hush! let me furl my forehead! I'll be gone To flicker and
           curl above great Babylon. [The Gate of the Garden op ens. THE LADY PSYCHE
           advances and makes way for THE KING OF BABYLON. He is attended by many
           companies of warriors in armour of burnished silver and gold, with swords,
           spears, and shields. These take up position at the back of the stage, in perfect
           silence of foot as of throat.] [THE LADY PSYCHE remains standing by the gate;
_____________________________________________________________________________________
           THE KING OF BABYLON advances with infinite stealth, dignity, slowness, and
           power, toward the couch.] PSYCHE. Life? Is it life? What hour of fate is on the
           bell? Of this supreme ordeal what issue? Heaven or hell? I am stripped of all my
           power now when I need it most; I am empty and unreal, a shadow or a ghost. All
           the great stake is thrown, even now the dice are falling. All deeds are locked in
           links, one to another calling through time: from the dim throne the first rune that
          was ree'd By God, the supreme Sphinx, determined the last deed. [THE KING
          OF BABYLON reaches forth his hand and arm. It is the hand and arm of a
          skeleton. He touches the forehead of the sleeping lord. Instantly, radiant and
          naked, a male figure is seen erect.]
PSYCHE    Adonis!
ADONIS    Psyche!
          [They run together and embrace.
PSYCHE    Ah! long-lost!
ADONIS    My wife! Light, O intolerable! Infinite love! O life Beyond death!
PSYCHE    I have found thee!
ADONIS    I was thine.
PSYCHE    I thine From all the ages!
ADONIS    To the ages!
PSYCHE    Mine!
          [The KING passes over and departs. Chorus of Soldiers Hail to the Lord! Without
          a spear, without a sword He hath smitten, he hath smitten, one stroke of his
          worth all our weaponed puissiances. There is no helm, no hauberk, no cuirass,
          No shield of sevenfold steel and sevenfold brass Resists his touch; no sword, no
          spear but shivers Before his glance. Eternally life quivers And reels before him;
          death itself, the hound of god, Slinks at his heel, and licks the dust that he hath
          trod. [They follow their Lord, singing. PSYCHE. I am a dewdrop focussing the
          sun That fires the forest to the horizon. I am a cloud on whom the sun begets
          The iris arch, a fountain in whose jets Throbs inner fire of the earth's heart, a
          flower Slain by the sweetness of the summer shower.
          I am myself, knowing I am thou. Forgetfulness forgotten now! Truth, truth
ADONIS    primeval, truth eternal, Unconditioned, sempiternal, Sets the God within the
          shrine And my mouth on thine, on thine.
          [THE LADY ASTARTE wakes. In her arms is the corpse of the LORD
          ESARHADDON.]
          O fearful dreams! Awake and kiss me! Awake! I thought I was crushed and
          strangled by a snake. [She rises. The corpse falls. He is dead! He is dead! O lips
ASTARTE   of burning bloom, You are ashen. [The jaw falls. The black laughter of the tomb!
          Then let me kill myself! Bring death distilled From nightshade, monkshood. Let
          no dawn regild this night. Let me not see the damnd light Of day, but drown in
          this black-hearted night! Ho, slaves! [ADONIS and PSYCHE advance to her.
          Thyself a slave! What curse (unbated Till patient earth herself is nauseated) Is
ADONIS    worse than this, an handmaiden that creeps Into her mistress' bed while her lord
          sleeps, And robs her?

ASTARTE   And what worse calamity Than his revenge? But leave me, let me die! [She falls
          prone at their feet.
          Add robbery to robbery! We need thee To serve us. Let us raise thee up and
PSYCHE    feed thee, Comfort and cherish thee until the end, Less slave than child, less
          servitor than friend.

ADONIS    Rise! let the breath flow, let the lips affirm Fealty and love. To the appointed term
          Within thy garden as belovd guests Of thine, let us abide. Now lips and breasts
_____________________________________________________________________________________
           Touching, three bodies and one soul, the triple troth confirm.
PSYCHE     The great indissoluble oath!
ASTARTE    Lift me!
           [They raise her; all embrace. By him that ever reigns upon The throne, and wears
           the crown, of Babylon, I serve, and love.
PSYCHE     This kiss confirm it!
ADONIS     This!
ASTARTE    I have gained all in losing all. Now kiss Once more with arms linked!
ADONIS     The dawn breaks!
ASTARTE   Behold Love's blush!
PSYCHE    Light's breaking!
ADONIS    Live's great globe of gold!
ASTARTE   Come! let us break our fast.
PSYCHE    My long fast's broken.
ADONIS    Let us talk of love.
PSYCHE    Love's first-last word is spoken.
          Nay! but the tides of trouble are transcended. The word's begun, but never shall
          be ended. And through the sun forsake the maiden east, Life be for us a never-
          fading feast. [They go towards the house, singing. ALL. The Crown of our life is
ADONIS    our love, The crown of our love is the light That rules all the region above The
          night and the stars of the night; That rules all the region aright, The abyss to
          abysses above; For the crown of our love is the light, And the crown of our light is
          our love.
