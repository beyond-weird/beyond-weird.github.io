THE FOLLOWING is an attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the
results of comparative religion.

The sceptic will applaud our labours, for that the very catholicity of the symbols
denies them any objective validity, since, in so many contradictions, something must
be false; while the mystic will rejoice equally that the self-same catholicity all-
embracing proves that very validity, since after all something must be true.

Fortunately we have learnt to combine these ideas, not in the mutual toleration of sub-
contraries, but in the affirmation of contraries, that transcending of the laws of
intellect which is madness in the ordinary man, genius in the Overman who hath
arrived to strike off more fetters from our understanding. The savage who cannot
conceive of the number six, the orthodox mathematician who cannot conceive of the
fourth dimension, the philosopher who cannot conceive of the Absolute--all these are
one; all must be impregnated with the Divine Essence of the Phallic Yod of
Macroprosopus, and give birth to their idea. True (we may agree with Balzac), the
Absolute recedes; we never grasp it; but in the travelling there is joy. Am I no better
than a staphylococcus because my ideas still crowd in chains?

But we digress.

The last attempts to tabulate knowledge are the Kabbala Denudata of Knorr von
Rosenroth (a work incomplete and, in some of its parts, prostituted to the service of
dogmatic interpretation), the lost symbolism of the Vault in which Christian
Rosenkreutz is said to have been buried, some of the work of Dr. Dee and Sir Edward
Kelly, some very imperfect tables in Cornelius Agrippa, the "Art" of Raymond Lully,
some of the very artificial effusions of the esoteric Theosophists, and of late years the
knowledge of the Order RosæRubeæet AureæCrucis and the Hermetic Order of the
Golden Dawn. Unluckily, the leading spirit in these latter societies1 found that his
prayer, "Give us this day our daily whisky, and just a wee drappie mair for luck!" was
sternly answered, "When you have given us this day our daily Knowledge-lecture."

Under these circumstances Daath got mixed with Dewar, and Beelzebub with
Buchanan.

But even the best of these systems is excessively bulky; modern methods have enabled
us to concentrate the substance of twenty thousand pages in two score.

The best of the serious attempts to systematise the results of Comparative Religion is
that made by Blavatsky. But though she had an immense genius for acquiring facts,
she had none whatever for sorting and selecting the essentials.

Grant Allen made a very slipshod experiment in this line; so have some of the
polemical rationalists; but the only man worthy of our notice is Frazer of the Golden
Bough. Here again, there is no tabulation; for us it is left to sacrifice literary charm,
and even some accuracy, in order to bring out the one great point.

This: That when a Japanese thinks of Hachiman, and a Boer of the Lord of Hosts, they
are not two thoughts, but one.

The cause of human sectarianism is not lack of sympathy in thought, but in speech;
and this it is our not unambitious design to remedy.

Every new sect aggravates the situation. Especially the Americans, grossly and
crapulously ignorant as they are of the rudiments of human language, seize like
mongrel curs upon the putrid bones of their decaying monkey-jabber, and gnaw and
tear them with fierce growls and howls.

The mental prostitute, Mrs. Eddy (for example), having invented the idea which
ordinary people call "God," christened it "Mind," and then by affirming a set of
propositions about "Mind," which are only true of "God," set all hysterical, dyspeptic,
crazy Amurrka by the ears. Personally, I don't object to people discussing the
properties of four-sided triangles; but I draw the line when they use a well-known
word, such as pig, or mental healer, or dung-heap, to denote the object of their
paranoiac fetishism.

Even among serious philosophers the confusion is very great. Such terms as God, the
Absolute, Spirit, have dozens of connotations, according to the time and place of the
dispute and the beliefs of the disputants.

Time enough that these definitions and their inter-relation should be crystallised, even
at the expense of accepted philosophical accuracy.

2. The principal sources of our tables have been the philosophers and traditional
systems referred to above, as also, among many others, Pietri di Abano,2 Lilly, Eliphaz
Levi, Sir R. Burton, Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese Classics,
the Qúran and its commentators, the Book of the Dead, and, in particular, original
research. The Chinese, Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem and Egyptian systems have never
before been brought into line with the Qabalah; the Tarot has never been made public.
Eliphaz Levi knew the true attributions but was forbidden to use them.*

All this secrecy is very silly. An indicible Arcanum is an arcanum that cannot be
revealed. It is simply bad faith to swear a man to the most horrible penalties if he
betray . . ., etc., and then take him mysteriously apart and confide the Hebrew
Alphabet to his safe keeping.3 This is perhaps only ridiculous; but it is a wicked
imposture to pretend to have received it from Rosicrucian manuscripts which are to be
found in the British Museum. To obtain money on these grounds, as has been done by
certain moderns, is clear (and, I trust, indictable) fraud.

The secrets of Adepts are not to be revealed to men. We only wish they were. When
a man comes to me and asks for the Truth, I go away and practice teaching the
Differential Calculus to a Bushman; and I answer the former only when I have
succeeded with the latter. But to withhold the Alphabet of Mysticism from the learner
is the device of a selfish charlatan. That which can be taught shall be taught, and that
which cannot be taught may at last be learnt.

* This is probably true, though in agreement with the statement of the traducer of Levi's
doctrine and the vilifier of his noble personality.
                                                 ii

3. As a weary but victorious warrior delights to recall his battles--Fortisan hæc olim
meminisse juvabit*--we would linger for a moment upon the difficulties of our task.

The question of sacred alphabets has been abandoned as hopeless. As one who should
probe the nature of woman, the deeper he goes the rottener it gets; so that at last it is
seen that there is no sound bottom. All is arbitrary; withdrawing out caustics and
adopting a protective treatment, we point to the beautiful clean bandages and ask the
clinic to admire! To take one concrete example: the English T is clearly equivalent in
sound to the Hebrew t, the Greek t, the Arabic P and the Coptic t, but the numeration
is not the same. Again, we have a clear analogy in shape (perhaps a whole series of
analogies), which, on comparing the modern alphabets with primeval examples,
breaks up and is indecipherable.

The same difficulty in another form permeates the question of gods.

Priests, to propitiate their local fetish, would flatter him with the title of creator;
philosophers, with a wider outlook, would draw identities between many gods in order
to obtain a unity. Time and the gregarious nature of man have raised gods as ideas
grew more universal; sectarianism has drawn false distinctions between identical gods
for polemical purposes.

Thus, where shall we put Isis, favouring nymph of corn as she was? As the type of
motherhood? As the moon? As the great goddess Earth? As Nature? As the Cosmic
Egg from which all Nature sprang? For as time and place have changed, so she is all
of these!

What of Jehovah, that testy senior of Genesis, that lawgiver of Leviticus, that Phallus
of the depopulated slaves of the Egyptians, that jealous King-God of the times of the
Kings, that more spiritual conception of the Captivity, only invented when all
temporal hope was lost, that mediæval battleground of cross-chopped logic, that Being
stripped of all his attributes and assimilated to Parabrahman and the Absolute of the
Philosopher?

Satan, again, who in Job is merely Attorney-General and prosecutes for the Crown,
acquires in time all the obloquy attaching to that functionary in the eyes of the
criminal classes, and becomes a slanderer. Does any one really think that any angel is
such a fool as to try to gull the Omniscient God into injustice to his saints?

Then, on the other hand, what of Moloch, that form of Jehovah denounced by those
who did not draw huge profit from his rites? What of the savage and morose Jesus of
the Evangelicals, cut by their petty malice from the gentle Jesus of the Italian
children? How shall we identify the thaumaturgic Chauvinist of Matthew with the
metaphysical Logos of John? In short, while the human mind is mobile, so long will
the definitions of all our terms vary.

*[Lat. approx. "perhaps it will be pleasant to remember these things one day."]
 All symbolism is perhaps ultimately so; there is no necessary relation in thought between the
idea of a mother, the sound of the child's cry "Ma," and the combination of lines ma. This, too,
is the extreme case, since "ma" is the sound naturally just produced by opening the lips and
breathing. Hindus would make a great fuss over this true connection; but it is very nearly the
only one. All these beautiful schemes break down sooner or later, mostly sooner.

                                               iii

But it is necessary to settle on something: bad rules are better than no rules at all. We
may then hope that our critics will aid our acknowledged feebleness; and if it be
agreed that much learning hath made us mad, that we may receive humane treatment
and a liberal allowance of rubber-cores in our old age.

4. The Tree of Life is the skeleton on which this body of truth is built. The
juxtaposition and proportion of its parts should be fully studied. Practice alone will
enable the student to determine how far an analogy may be followed out. Again, some
analogies may escape a superficial study. The Beetle is only connected with the sign
Pisces through the Tarot Trump "The Moon." The Camel is only connected with the
High Priestess through the letter Gimel.

Since all things whatsoever (including no thing) may be placed upon the Tree of Life,
the Table could never be complete. It is already somewhat unwieldy; we have tried to
confine ourselves as far as possible to lists of Things Generally Unknown. It must be
remembered that the lesser tables are only divided from the thirty-two-fold table in
order to economise space; e.g. in the seven-fold table the entries under Saturn belong
to the thirty-second part in the large table.

We have been unable for the moment to tabulate many great systems of Magic; the
four lesser books of the Lemegeton,4 the system of Abramelin, if indeed its Qliphothic
ramifications are susceptible of classification, once we follow it below the great and
terrible Demonic Triads which are under the presidency of the Unutterable Name;5 the
vast and comprehensive system shadowed in the Book called the Book of the
Concourse of the Forces,6 interwoven as it is with the Tarot, being, indeed, on one
view little more than an amplification and practical application of the Book of Thoth.7

But we hope that the present venture will attract scholars from all quarters, as when
the wounded Satan leaned upon his spear,

           " Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
             By angels many and strong,"

and that in the course of time a far more satisfactory volume may result.

Many columns will seem to the majority of people to consist of mere lists of senseless
words. Practice, and advance in the magical or mystical path, will enable little by
little to interpret more and more.

Even as a flower unfolds beneath the ardent kisses of the Sun, so will this table reveal
its glories to the dazzling eye of illumination. Symbolic and barren as it is, yet it shall
stand for the athletic student as a perfect sacrament, so that reverently closing its pages
he shall exclaim, "May that of which we have partaken sustain us in the search for the
Quintessence, the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonus, True Wisdom, and Perfect
Happiness.

So mote it be!

COL. XII. This arrangement is the basis of the whole
system of this book. Besides the 10 numbers and the
22 letters, it is divisible into 3 columns, 4 planes, 7
planes, 7 palaces, etc. etc.8

Editorial Note: The Atus of Thoth

Liber AL, cap. I, v. 57 includes the statement: "All these old letters of my Book are aright: but x is not
the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise." In Crowley's `New Comment'
on this verse, he observes:

           I see no harm in revealing the mystery of Tzaddi to `the wise'; others will hardly
           understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of The Emperor, the Trump IV,
           and He is the Star, the Trump XVII. Aquarius and Aries are therefore counter-
           changed, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as, in the Trumps VIII and XI,
           Leo and Libra do about Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarot attributions
           sublimely, perfectly, flawlessly symmetrical. The fact of its so doing is a most
           convincing proof of the superhuman Wisdom of the author of this Book to those
           who have laboured for years, in vain, to elucidate the problems of the Tarot.

This substituted attribution is alluded to in various places in Liber Aleph and Magick in Theory and
Practice, but was not spelt out in full in published writings until The Book of Thoth. The tables from
777 are based on the old Golden Dawn attributions; to work with the reversed attributions, lines 15
and 28 should be exchanged on all columns based on the Zodiac or Tarot (i.e., VI-VIII, XI, XIV-XX,
XXII-XLVII, XLIX, CXXXVII-CLXXIV, CLXXVII-CLXXXIII and CLXXXVI), not all columns throughout as
the editors of 777 Revised state ­ T.S.

                                          Transcriber's notes

[The work as presented here is currently incomplete: owing to my complete ignorance of Arabic, one
column (the Princes of the Jinn) and some endnote material (the 99 names of God) in that language
have not been entered.]

This electronic edition of 777 was prepared from the version of 777 Revised printed in 777 and other
Qabalistic Writings (originally published as The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley). As far as I can tell
this was a facsimile from the 1955 first edition of 777 Revised; while Crowley's original Preface was
re-set in the 1955 edition, the Tables of Correspondence, Crowley's notes thereon, and the appendix
giving the trigrams and hexagrams of the I Ching were with minor exceptions straight facsimiles from
the original 1909 edition of 777.

In preparing the present edition I have included, besides the Preface, tables, notes and appendix from
the original edition, the following additional material from 777 Revised:
*   The 11 additional columns (CLXXXIV ­ CXCIV). These were originally appended at the end of
    Table VI. Six were explanatory of or supplementary to existing columns: (e.g. numerations of
    Greek and Arabic letters, transliterations or translations; the "magical formulæ" column was
    specifically referred to the column of magical weapons); these have been placed immediately
    after the appropriate column. The others have been appended to the end of the appropriate table.
    While they are hence "out of sequence" I feel this is unlikely to cause confusion as these
    additional columns are rarely if ever directly referenced by number in other works.
*   Additional correspondences as mentioned in Crowley's remarks on the various columns. They
    are inserted into the appropriate columns in double square brackets [[like this]].

Also added are:
*   Numeration of Coptic.
*   Transliterations of most Hebrew names.

In order to keep the present work at a manageable size, I have not included:
*   Yorke's editorial preface.
*   The essay on the Magical Alphabet
*   The Meaning of the Primes from 11 to 97.
*   The "Various Arrangements" (mostly from The Book of Thoth)
*   The "Explanations of the Attributions" ­ a series of remarks, some developing almost into essays,
    on columns I-III, V-VIII, X, XI, XIII-XXII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVIII-XLIII, XLV, LVI-LXVIII, LXXVII-
    LXXXVI, and XCVII.
*   "What is Qabalah?"
*   "What is a `Number' or a `Symbol'?" (an extract from the New Comment on AL I.4)

Some of this additional material may later be made available in HTML format.

I have not attempted to preserve the original pagination of the tables of correspondence. For ease of
reading, columns are arranged from left to right across a single page. Obvious typos have been
corrected; other questionable readings are noted below.

15 I have reduced this into a single table to save
space, representing each day and Angel with the
corresponding planetary symbol.
16  The names here have been conformed to the
version of the Heptameron printed in the Lyons
edition of Agrippa's Opera.          Crowley, possibly
because he was working from a corrupted copy,
stated that none were given for Winter; although the
names he gave for the Sun and Moon in Autumn
were those referred to Winter by pseudo-Abano.
17Probably in his Oedipus Ægypticus. It is this book
(late 17th century) which as far as I am aware
contains the earliest known appearance of the
version of the Tree of Life used by the G.D. and
Crowley, and in fact most modern Western
occultists.    Other Tree of Life arrangements are
discussed by Aryeh Kaplan in his translation of the
Sepher Yetzirah.

Transliterations of Chinese names follow the system
used by Legge in Sacred Books of the East, which is
not in general current use. Note that italicised letters
have different phonetic values to non-italicised (K is
"thin (tenuis) modified guttural consonant", Kh
"aspirated thin modified guttural"). b represents the
`neutral' vowel sound.       Where Crowley has `tz',
Legge used a character something like a stylised 3,
which I have been unable to find in any of the
typefaces I currently have; but as far as I can tell
from the table of transliteration conventions, this is
equivalent to the Hebrew x (described helpfully as
"Spiritus asperrimus 2" under dental consonants).

While this may be a little awkward and confusing, I
would submit it is to be preferred to a transliteration
scheme      which    manages     to  give   the   same
transliteration for two different Chinese characters
(vide the Wilhelm-Baynes I Ching, s.v. Hexagram
63).

The main traditional glosses to the trigrams are:
  7        Heaven, sky

  6        Water (marsh or lake)

  5        Fire, sun, lightning

  4        Thunder

  3        Wind and wood

  2        Water (rain, clouds, springs), moon

  1        Hill or mountain

  0        Earth

Additional traditional correspondences can be found
in the "EighthWing" (Appendix V. in the Legge
edition, "Shuo Kwa / Discussion of the Trigrams" in
Part II of the Wilhelm-Baynes edition).
