     DESCRIPTION OF THE CARDS OF THE TAROT



       The Descriptions of the Seventy-eight Symbols
                of this Book Ï; together with
                        their meanings


                       OF THE ACES
   FIRST in order and importance are the Four Aces,
representing the Force of the Spirit, acting in, and binding
together, the Four Scales of each Element: and answering to
the Dominion of the Letters of the Name in the Kether of
each. They represent the Radical Forces.
   The Four Aces are said to be placed on the North Pole of
the Universe wherein they revolve, governing its revolution;
and ruling as the connecting link between Yetzirah and the
Material Plane or Universe.


                                 I
         THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF FIRE
                          Ace of Wands
   A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds,
and grasping a heavy club, which has three branches in the
colours, and with the sigils, of the scales. The Right-and Left-
hand branches end respectively in three Flames, and the
Centre one in four Flames: thus yielding Ten: the Number of
the Sephiroth.   Two-and-twenty leaping Flames, or Yodh,


                                                            153
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                       THE EQUINOX

surround it, answering to the Paths; of these, three fall below
the Right branch for Aleph, Men, and Shin, seven above the
Central branch for the double letters; and between it and that
of the Right twelve: six above and six below about the Left-
hand branch. The whole is a great and flaming Torch. It
symbolizes Force--strength, rush, vigour, energy, and it
governs, according to its nature, various works and ques-
tions.
   It implies Natural, as opposed to Invoked, Force.




                               II
     THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE WATERS
                      Ace of Cups or Chalices
   A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and
supporting on the palm thereof a cup, resembling that of the
Stolistes.
   From it rises a fountain of clear and glistening water:
and sprays falling on all sides into clear calm water below,
in which grow Lotuses and Water-lilies. The great Letter
of the Supernal Mother is traced in the spray of the
Fountain.
   It symbolizes Fertility--productiveness, beauty, pleasure,
happiness, etc.

     DESCRIPTION OF THE CARDS OF THE TAROT


                              III
       THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE AIR
                        Ace of Swords
   A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds,
and grasping the hilt of a sword, which supports a White
Radiant Celestial Crown; from which depend, on the right,
the olive branch of Peace; and on the left, the palm branch of
suffering.
   Six Vaus fall from its point. It symbolizes Invoked, as
contrasted with Natural Force: for it is the Invocation of the
Sword.    Raised upward, it invokes the Divine crown of
Spiritual Brightness, but reversed it is the Invocation of
Demonic Force; and becomes a fearfully evil symbol.         It
represents, therefore, very great power for good or evil, but
invoked; and it also represents whirling Force, and strength
through trouble. It is the affirmation of Justice upholding
Divine Authority; and it may become the Sword of Wrath,
Punishment, and Affliction.



                              IV
    THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE EARTH
                        Ace of Pentacles
   A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, holding a branch of a
Rose Tree, whereon is a large Pentacle, formed of Five con-
centric circles. The Innermost Circle is white, charged with a


                                                           155
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                        THE EQUINOX

red Greek Cross. From this White Centre, Twelve Rays,
also white, issue: these terminate at the circumference,
making the whole something like an Astrological figure of the
Heavens.
    It is surmounted by a small circle, above which is a large
white Maltese Cross, and with two white wings.
    Four Crosses and two buds are shewn. The Hand issueth
from the Clouds as in the other three cases.
    It represents materiality in all senses, good and evil: and
is, therefore, in a sense, illusionary: it shows material gain,
labour, power, wealth, etc.




       THE SIXTEEN COURT, OR ROYAL CARDS
                         The Four Kings
    THE Four Kings, or "Figures mounted on steeds,"
represent the Yodh forces of the Name in each Suit: the
Radix, Father and commencement of Material Forces, a force
in which all the others are implied, and of which they form the
development and completion. A force swift and violent in its
action, but whose effect soon passes away, and therefore
symbolized by a Figure on a Steed riding swiftly, and clothed
in complete Armour.
    Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so
necessary for the commencement of all magical working.

      DESCRIPTION OF THE CARDS OF THE TAROT




                        The Four Queens
are seated upon Thrones; representing the Forces of the Hé
of the Name in each suit; the Mother and bringer-forth of
Material Forces: a force which develops and realizes that of
the King: a force steady and unshaken, but not rapid, though
enduring. It is therefore symbolized by a Figure seated upon a
Throne: but also clothed in Armour.



                        The Four Princes
   These Princes are Figures seated in Chariots, and thus
borne forward. They represent the Vau Forces of the Name in
each suit: the Mighty Son of the King and Queen, who
realizes the influence of both scales of Force. A Prince, the
son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, and a King
of Kings: an Emperor whose effect is at once rapid (though
not so swift as that of the Queen) and enduring. It is,
therefore, symbolized by a Figure borne in a Chariot, and
clothed in Armour. Yet is his power vain and illusionary,
unless set in Motion by his Father and Mother.



                       The Four Princesses
are the Knaves of the Tarot Pack; The Four Princesses or
figures of Amazons, standing firmly of themselves: neither
riding upon Horses, nor seated upon Thrones, nor borne in

Chariots. They represent the forces of the Hé final of the
Name in each suit, completing the Influences of the other
scales: The mighty and potent daughter of a King and Queen:
a Princess powerful and terrible: a Queen of Queens--an
Empress--whose effect combines those of the King, Queen,
and Prince, at once violent and permanent; therefore symbol-
ized by a Figure standing firmly by itself, only partially
draped, and having but little Armour; yet her power existeth
not, save by reason of the others: and then indeed it is mighty
and terrible materially, and is the Throne of the Forces of the
Spirit.
   Woe unto whomsoever shall make war upon her, when
thus established!




        THE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE OF THE
         COURT CARDS OF THE TAROT PACK
   THE Princesses rule the Four Parts of the Celestial
Heavens which lie around the north Pole, and above the
respective Cherubic Signs of the Zodiac, and they form the
Thrones of the Powers of the Four Aces.
   The twelve cards, the Four Kings, Queens and Princes
rule the dominion of the Celestial Heavens, between the
realm of the Four Princesses and the Zodiac, as is hereafter
shewn. And they, as it were, link together the signs.

                                    V
     THE LORD OF THE FLAME AND THE LIGHT-
       NING; THE KING OF THE SPIRITS OF FIRE
                            Knight1 of Wands
    A WINGED Warrior riding upon a black horse with
flaming mane and tail: the horse itself is not winged. The
rider wears a winged helmet (like the old Scandinavian and
Gaulish helmet) with a Rayed Crown, a corslet of scale-
mail and buskins of the same, and a flowing scarlet mantle.
Above his helmet, upon his curass, and on the shoulder-
pieces and buskins, he wears as a crest a winged black
horse's head. He grasps a club with flaming ends, somewhat
similar to that in the symbol of the Ace of Wands, but not so
heavy, and also the sigil of his scale is shown; beneath the
rushing feet of his steed are waving flames and fire. He
is active--generous--fierce--sudden--impetuous.
    If ill dignified, he is evil-minded--cruel--bigoted--brutal.
He rules the celestial heavens from above the Twentieth
Degree of h to the First Two Decans of i: and this includes a
part of the Constellation Hercules. (Hercules is always
represented with a Club.)
                                B of B
                       King of the Salamanders.


  1 Note that the Kings are now called Knights, and the Princes are now
called Kings. This is unfortunate, and leads to confusion; the Princes may
be called Emperors without harm. Remember only that the horsed figures
refer to the Yod of Tetragrammaton, the charioted figures to the Vau.

     THE QUEEN OF THE THRONES OF FLAME
                         Queen of Wands
   A CROWNED Queen with long red-golden hair, seated upon
a Throne, with steady flames beneath. She wears a corslet
and buskins of scale-mail, which latter her robe discloses.
Her arms are almost bare.         On cuirass and buskins are
leopard's heads winged, and the same symbol surmounteth
her crown. At her side is a couchant leopard on which her
hands rest. She bears a long wand with a very heavy conical
head. The face is beautiful and resolute.
   Adaptability, steady force applied to an object, steady rule,
great attractive power, power of command, yet liked
notwithstanding. Kind and generous when not opposed.
   If ill dignified, obstinate, revengeful, domineering, tyran-
nical, and apt to turn against another without a cause.
   She rules the heavens from above the last Decan of l to
above the 20° of a: including thus a part of Andromeda.

is shewn.     He wears corslet and buskins of scale armour
decorated with a winged lion's head, which symbol also
surmounts his crown. His chariot is drawn by a lion. His arms
are bare, save for the shoulder-pieces of the corslet, and he
bears a torch or fire-wand, somewhat similar to that of the
Zelator Adeptus Minor. Beneath the chariot are flames, some
waved, some salient.
   Swift, strong, hasty; rather violent, yet just and generous;
noble and scorning meanness.
   If ill dignified--cruel, intolerant, prejudiced and ill natured.
   He rules the heavens from above the last Decan of d to
the second Decan of e; hence he includes most of Leo
Minor.

   A VERY strong and beautiful woman with flowing red-gold
hair, attired like an Amazon. Her shoulders, arms, bosom

knee. Round her waist is a broad belt of scale-mail; narrow
at the sides; broader in front and back; and having a winged
tiger's head in front. She wears a Corinthian-shaped helmet
and crown with a long plume. It also is surmounted by a

tiger's head, and the same symbol forms the buckle of her
scale-mail buskins. A mantle lined with tiger's skin falls back
from her shoulders. Her right hand rests on a small golden or
brazen altar ornamented with ram's heads and with Flames of
Fire leaping from it. Her left hand leans on a long and heavy
club, swelling at the lower end, where the sigil is placed; and
it has flames of fire leaping from it the whole way down; but
the flames are ascending. This club or torch is much longer
than that carried by the King or Queen. Beneath her firmly
placed feet are leaping Flames of Fire.
   Brilliance, courage, beauty, force, sudden in anger or love,
desire of power, enthusiasm, revenge.
   If ill dignified, she is superficial, theatrical, cruel, unstable,

but upon his helmet, cuirass and buskins is a peacock with
opened wings. He holds a cup in his hand, bearing the sigil of
the scale. Beneath his horse's feet is the sea. From the cup
issues a crab.
   Graceful, poetic, Venusian, indolent, but enthusiastic if
roused.

   A VERY beautiful fair woman like a crowned Queen, seated
upon a throne, beneath which is flowing water wherein
Lotuses are seen. Her general dress is similar to that of the
Queen of Wands, but upon her crown, cuirass and buskins is
seen an Ibis with opened wings, and beside her is the same
bird, whereon her hand rests. She holds a cup, wherefrom a
crayfish issues. Her face is dreamy. She holds a lotus in the
hand upon the Ibis.
   She is imaginative, poetic, kind, yet not willing to take
much trouble for another. Coquettish, good-natured and under-

chariot drawn by an eagle. On the wheel is the symbol of
a scorpion. The eagle is borne as a crest on his crown, cuirass
and buskins. General attire like King of Wands. Beneath his
chariot is the calm and stagnant water of a lake. His armour
resembles feathers more than scales. He holds in one hand a
lotus, and in the other a cup, charged with the sigil of his
scale. A serpent issues from the cup, and has its head tending
down to the waters of the lake. He is subtle, violent, crafty
and artistic; a fierce nature with calm exterior. Powerful for
good or evil but more attracted by the evil if allied with
apparent Power or Wisdom.
   If ill dignified, he is intensely evil and merciless.
   He rules from 20° g to 20° h.

lotus, and in the other an open cup from which a turtle issues.

as that of the Knight of Wands, but he wears as a crest a
winged six-pointed star, similar to those represented on the
heads of Castor and Pollux the Dioscuri, the twins Gemini (a

drawn sword with the sigil of his scale upon its pommel.
Beneath his horse's feet are dark-driving stratus clouds.

    A WINGED King with Winged Crown, seated in a chariot
drawn by Arch Fays, represented as winged youths very
slightly dressed, with butterfly wings: heads encircled by a
fillet with a pentagram thereon: and holding wands sur-
mounted by pentagrams, the same butterfly wings on their
feet and fillets. General equipment as the King of Wands: but
he bears as a crest a winged angelic head with a pentagram on
the brows. Beneath the chariot are grey nimbus clouds. His
hair long and waving in serpentine whirls, and whorl figures
compose the scales of his armour. A drawn sword in one hand;
a sickle in the other. With the sword he rules, with the sickle
he slays.
    Full of ideas and thoughts and designs, distrustful,
suspicious, firm in friendship and enmity; careful, observant,
slow, over-cautious, symbolizes A and W; he slays as fast as he
creates.

the others. This is the Planet Mars, to which are allotted the
last Decan of l, and the first of a, because the long cold
of the winter requires a great energy to overcome it, and
initiate spring.
    And the beginning of the Decantes is from the royal
Star of Leo, the great Star Cor Leonis: and therefore is the
first Decan that of ' in e.
    Here follow the general meanings of the small cards of
the suits, as classified under the nine Sephiroth below
Kether.
    hmkj The Four Twos symbolize the Powers of the King
and Queen just uniting and initiating the Force; but before
the Prince and Princess are thoroughly brought into action.
Therefore do they generally imply the initiation and
fecundation of a thing.
    hnyb     Realization of action owing to the Prince being
produced. The central symbol on each card. Action definitely
commenced for good or evil.
    dsj   Perfection, realization, completion: making a matter
settled and fixed.
    hrwbg    Opposition, strife and struggle: war; obstacle to
the thing in hand. Ultimate success or failure is otherwise
shewn.
    trapt   Definite accomplishment. Thing carried out.
    jxn   Generally shew a force transcending the Material
Plane: and is like unto a Crown; which, indeed, is powerful,
but requireth one capable of wearing it. The Sevens then
shew a possible result: which is dependent on the action then
taken. They depend much on the symbols that accompany
them.

   dwh  Solitary success: i.e. success in the matter for the time
being: but not leading to much result apart from the thing
itself.
   dwsy Very great fundamental force. Executive power,
because they restore a firm basis. Powerful for good or evil.
   twklm Fixed, culminated, complete Force, whether good or
evil. The matter thoroughly and definitely determined.
Ultimating Force.

cards: with full meanings.
   Decan-cards are always modified by the other symbols
with which they are in contact.



                               XXI
                   THE LORD OF STRIFE
                         Five of Wands
   TWO White Radiant Angelic Hands issuant per nubes dex-
ter and sinister. They are clasped together in the grip of the
First Order, i.e. the four fingers of each right hand crooked
into each other, the thumbs meeting above; and they hold, at
the same time, by their centres, five wands or torches which
are similar unto the wands of a Zelator Adeptus Minor. One
wand is upright in the middle; the others cross each other.
Flames leap from the point of junction. Above the middle
wand is the sign ', and below is that of e: thus repre-
senting the Decante. Violent strife and boldness, rashness,
cruelty, violence, lust, desire, prodigality and generosity;
depending on whether the card is well or ill dignified.

                                                               177

   Geburah of y (Quarrelling and fighting).
   This Decan hath its beginning from the Royal Star of
Leo: and unto it are allotted the two great Angels of the
Schemhamphorash hywhw and layly.
   [The proper meaning of the small cards is to be found by
making thorough meditation and harmony between these four
symbols of each card. It will be seen that this is how the
meanings have been done; but the advanced student can go
beyond this rude working.]




                            XXII
                 THE LORD OF VICTORY

   TWO hands in grip as the last, holding six wands crossed
three and three. Flames issue from the point of junction.
Above and below are short wands with flames issuing,
surmounted respectively by the symbols of & and e,
representing the Decan.
   Victory after strife: Love: pleasure gained by labour:
carefulness, sociability and avoiding of strife, yet victory
therein: also insolence, and pride of riches and success, etc.
The whole dependent on the dignity.
   Tiphareth of y (Gain).
   Hereunto are allotted the great Angels lafys and hymlu of
the Schemhamphorash.

   TWO hands holding by grip six wands, three crossed.
A third hand issuing from a cloud at the lower part of the card,

central wand are the symbols of % and e, representing the
Decan.
   Possible victory, depending on the energy and courage
exercised; valour; opposition, obstacles and difficulties, yet
courage to meet them; quarrelling, ignorance, pretence, and
wrangling, and threatening; also victory in small and
unimportant things: and influence upon subordinates.

without the Maltese cross and wings. They are arranged like
the geomantic figure Populus. Above and below them are the
symbols ! and f for the Decan.

   AN Angelic Hand, holding by the lower extremity a branch
whose roses touch all the Pentacles. No buds, however, are
shewn. The symbols of # and f are above and below.
   The Pentacles are thus arranged Í.
   Completion of material gain and fortune; but nothing
beyond: as it were, at the very pinnacle of success. Old age,
slothfulness; great wealth, yet sometimes loss in part;
heaviness; dullness of mind, yet clever and prosperous in
money transactions.

   Contradictory characters in the same nature, strength
through suffering; pleasure after pain. Sacrifice and trouble,
yet strength arising therefrom, symbolized by the position of
the rose, as though the pain itself had brought forth beauty.
Arrangement, peace restored; truce; truth and untruth;
sorrow and sympathy.         Aid to the weak; arrangement;

on being pardoned; injury when meaning well; given to
petitions; also a want of tact, and asking question of little
moment; talkative.

   THREE White Radiating Angelic Hands, issuing from

cup, each is overhung by a lotus flower, but no water falls from
these into any of the cups, which are all quite empty. Above

are the Decan symbols & and c.
    Too much force applied to small things: too much
attention to detail at the expense of the principal and more
important points. When ill dignified, these qualities produce
malice, pettiness, and domineering characteristics. Patience

in detail of study; great care in some things, counterbalanced
by equal disorder in others. Impulsive; equally fond of giving
or receiving money or presents; generous, clever, acute, selfish
and without strong feeling of affection. Admires wisdom, yet
applies it to small and unworthy objects.

                               LII
         THE LORD OF DESPAIR AND CRUELTY
                         Nine of Swords
   FOUR Hands, as in the preceding figure, hold eight swords
nearly upright, but with the points falling away from each
other. A fifth hand holds a ninth sword upright in the centre,
as if it had struck them asunder. No rose at all is shewn, as if
it were not merely cut asunder, but utterly destroyed. Above
and below are the Decan symbols % and c.
   Despair, cruelty, pitilessness, malice, suffering, want, loss,
misery. Burden, oppression, labour, subtlety and craft,
dishonesty, lying and slander.
   Yet also obedience, faithfulness, patience, unselfishness,
etc. According to dignity.

                   THE LORD OF RUIN
                          Ten of Swords
   FOUR hands holding eight swords, as in the preceding
symbol; the points falling away from each other.         Two
hands hold two swords crossed in the centre, as though their
junction had disunited the others. No rose, flower or bud,
is shewn. Above and below are ! and c, representing the
Decan.
   Almost a worse symbol than the Nine of Swords. Un-
disciplined, warring force, complete disruption and failure.
Ruin of all plans and projects. Disdain, insolence and im-
pertinence, yet mirth and jollity therewith. A marplot, loving
to overthrow the happiness of others; a repeater of things;
given to much unprofitable speech, and of many words. Yet
clever, eloquent, etc., according to dignity.

above water, which occupies the lower part of the card rising
above the hand. From this flower rises a stem, terminating
near the top of the card in another lotus, from which flows a
sparkling white water, as from a fountain. Crossed on the
stem just beneath are two dolphins, Argent and Or, on to
which the water falls, and from which it pours in full streams,
like jets of gold and silver, into two cups; which in their turn
overflow, flooding the lower part of the card. $ and d above
and below.
   Harmony of masculine and feminine united. Harmony,
pleasure, mirth, subtlety: but if ill dignified--folly, dissi-
pation, waste, silly actions.
   Chokmah of h (Marriage, love, pleasure).
   Therein rule the Angels lauya and hywbj.




                               LV
               THE LORD OF ABUNDANCE
                         Three of Chalices
   A WHITE Radiating Hand, as before, holds a group of
lotuses or water-lilies, from which two flowers rise on either
side of, and overhanging the top cup; pouring into it the white
water. Flowers in the same way pour white water into the
lower cups. All the cups overflow; the topmost into the two
others, and these upon the lower part of the card. Cups are
arranged in an erect equilateral triangle. # and d above and

          THE LORD OF BLENDED PLEASURE
                        Four of Chalices
   FOUR cups: the two upper overflowing into the two lower,
which do not overflow. An Angelic Hand grasps a branch of
lotus, from which ascends a stem bearing one flower at the top
of the card, from which the white water flows into the two
upper cups. From the centre two leaves pass right and left,
making, as it were, a cross between the four cups. Above and
below are the symbols = and d for the Decan.
   Success or pleasure approaching their end. A stationary
period in happiness, which may, or may not, continue. It does
not mean love and marriage so much as the previous symbol.
It is too passive a symbol to represent perfectly complete
happiness. Swiftness, hunting and pursuing. Acquisition by
contention: injustice sometimes; some drawbacks to pleasure
implied.
   Chesed of h (Receiving pleasure or kindness from others,
but some discomfort therewith).
   Therein rule the great Angels layyh and hymwm.

        BRIEF MEANING OF TWENTY-TWO KEYS
    0.,,IF the question refers to spiritual matters, the Fool
means idea, thought, spirituality, that which endeavours to
transcend Earth.      But if question is material, it means
folly, stupidity, eccentricity, or even mania.
    1.,,Skill, wisdom, adaptation, craft, cunning, or occult
wisdom or power.
    2.,,Change, alternation, increase and decrease, fluctuation;
whether for good or evil depends on the dignity.
    3.,,Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success. But with very bad
dignity it means luxury, dissipation.
    4.,,War, conquest, victory, strife, ambition.
    5.,,Divine wisdom, manifestation, explanation, teaching,
occult force voluntarily invoked.
    6.,,Inspiration (passive, mediumistic), motive power,
action.
    7.,,Triumph, victory, health (sometimes unstable).
    8.,,Eternal justice. Strength and force, but arrested as in act
of judgment. May mean law, trial, etc.
    9.,,Wisdom from on high.          Active divine inspiration.
Sometimes "unexpected current."
    10.,,Good fortune, happiness (within bounds). Intoxication
of success.
    11.,,Courage, strength, fortitude, power passing on to
action. Obstinacy.
    12.,,Enforced sacrifice, punishment, loss, fatal and not
voluntary, suffering.


                                                               203
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                         THE EQUINOX

    13.,,Time, age, transformation, change involuntary (as
opposed to 18, Pisces). Or death, destruction (only latter with
special cards). [Specially, a sudden and quite unexpected
change.]
    14.,,Combination of forces, realization, action (material
effect, good or evil).
    15. Materiality, material force, material temptation,
obsession.
    16. Ambition, fighting, war, courage, or destruction, danger,
fall, ruin.
    17. Hope, faith, unexpected help. Or dreaminess, deceived
hope, etc.
    18. Dissatisfaction, voluntary change. Error, lying, falsity,
deception. This card is very sensitive to dignity.
    19. Glory, gain, riches. With very evil cards it means
arrogance, display, vanity.
    20.,,Final decision, judgment, sentence, determination of a
matter without appeal, on its plane.
    21.,,The matter itself. Synthesis, world, kingdom. Usually
denotes actual subject of question, and therefore depends
entirely on accompanying cards.
    [This table is very unsatisfactory. Each card must be most
carefully meditated, taking all its correspondences, and a clear
idea formed.]
    Princes and Queens shew almost always actual men and
women connected with the matter.
    But the Kings (Knights) sometime represent coming or
going of a matter, according as they face.
    The Princesses shew opinions, thoughts, ideas, either in
harmony with or opposed to, the subject.

                     OF THE DIGNITIES
   A CARD is strong or weak, well dignified or ill dignified,
according to the cards next to it on either side.
   Cards of the same suit on either side strengthen it greatly,
for good or evil according to their nature.
   Cards of opposite natures on either side weaken it greatly,
for either good or evil.
   Swords are inimical to Pentacles.
   Wands are inimical to Cups.
   Swords are friendly with Cups and Wands.
   Wands are friendly with Swords and Pentacles.
   If a card fall between two other which are mutually
contrary, it is not much affected by either.

      DESCRIPTION OF THE CARDS OF THE TAROT



     A METHOD OF DIVINATION BY THE TAROT
   [This method is that given to students of the grade Adept
Adeptus Minor in the R. R. et A. C. But it has been revised
and improved, while certain safeguards have been introduced
in order to make its abuse impossible.--O.M.]

   1.,,THE Significator.
   Choose a card to represent the Querent, using your
knowledge or judgment of his character rather than dwelling
on his physical characteristics.
   2.,,Take the cards in your left hand. In the right hand
hold the wand over them, and say: I invoke thee, I A O,
that thou wilt send H R U, the great Angel that is set over the
operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly
upon these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may
obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of thine
ineffable Name. Amen.
   3.,,Hand the cards to Querent, and bid him think of the
question attentively, and cut.
   4.,,Take the cards as cut, and hold as for dealing.




                        First Operation
   This shows the situation of the Querent at the time when
he consults you.
   1. The pack being in front of you, cut, and place the top
half to the left.


                                                            207
_____________________________________________________________________________________
                         THE EQUINOX

   2.,,Cut each pack again to the left.
   3.,,These four stack represent I H V H, from right to left.
   4.,,Find the Significator. It be in the y pack, the question
refers to work, business, etc.; if in the h pack, to love,
marriage, or pleasure; if in the w pack, to trouble, loss, scandal,
quarrelling, etc; if in the # pack, to money, goods, and such
purely material matters.
   5.,,Tell the Querent what he has come for: if wrong,
abandon the divination.
   6.,,If right, spread out the pack containing the Significator,
face upwards.
   Count the cards from him, in the direction in which he
faces.
   The counting should include the card from which you
count.
   For Knights, Queens and Princes, count 4.
   For Princesses, count 7.
   For Aces, count 11.
   For small cards, count according to the number.
   For trumps, count 3 for the elemental trumps; 9 for the
planetary trumps; 12 for the Zodiacal trumps.
   Make a "story" of these cards. This story is that of the
beginning of the affair.
   7. Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then
those outside them, and so on. Make another "story," which
should fill in the details omitted in the first.
   8. If this story is not quite accurate, do not be discouraged.
Perhaps the Querent himself does not know everything. But
the main lines ought to be laid down firmly, with correctness,
or the divination should be abandoned.

     DESCRIPTION OF THE CARDS OF THE TAROT


                         Second Operation
                 Development of the Question
   1.,,Shuffle, invoke suitably, and let Querent cut as before.
   2.,,Deal cards into twelve stacks, for the twelve astrological
houses of heaven.
   3.,,Make up your mind in which stack you ought to find
the Significator, e.g. in the seventh house if the question
concerns marriage, and so on.
   4.,,Examine this chosen stack. If the Significator is not
there, try some cognate house. On a second failure, abandon
the divination.
   5.,,Read the stack counting and pairing as before.


                          Third Operation
             Further Development of the Question
   1.,,Shuffle, etc., as before.
   2.,,Deal cards into twelve stacks for the twelve signs of the
Zodiac.
   3.,,Divine the proper stack and proceed as before.


                         Fourth Operation
              Penultimate Aspects of the Question
   1.,,Shuffle, etc., as before.
   2.,,Find the Significator: set him upon the table; let the
thirty-six cards following form a ring round him.


                                                             209
