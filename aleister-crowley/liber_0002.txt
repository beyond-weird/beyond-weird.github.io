                     THE MESSAGE
          OF THE MASTER THERION
       (All quotations in this Message are from Liber CCXX,
       The Book of the Law)

   "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
   "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt."
   "The word of the Law is qelhma."

QELHMA--Thelema--means Will.

The Key to this Message is this word--Will. The first obvious
meaning of this Law is confirmed by antithesis; "The Word of Sin
is Restriction."

Again: "... thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no
other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose,
delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect."

Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man
and every woman did his and her will--the true Will--there
would be no clashing. "Every man and every woman is a star",
and each star moves in an appointed path without interference.
There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that creates
confusion.

From these considerations it should be clear that "Do what thou
wilt" does not mean "Do what you like." It is the apotheosis of
Freedom; but it is also the strictest possible bond.

Do what thou wilt--then do nothing else. Let nothing deflect
thee from that austere and holy task. Liberty is absolute to do thy

will; but seek to do any other thing whatever, and instantly
obstacles must arise. Every act that is not in definite course of that
one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must not be two, but one.
Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as
explained above, but also "unassuaged of purpose". This strange
phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the
will would damp it; clearly, the "lust of result" is a thing from
which it must be delivered.
But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read "with purpose
unassuaged"--i.e. with tireless energy. The conception is,
therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is
Nirvana, only dynamic instead of static--and this comes to the
same thing in the end.
The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover
what his will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he
can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisharb (see
Equinox I, VII, 105) or such others as may from one time to
another be appointed.
It should now be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the
Message of the Master Therion.
Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will, (2) Do that Will with (a)
one-pointedness, (b) detachment, (c) peace.
Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of
Things, thy will part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God.
And since the will is but the dynamic aspect of the self, and since
two different selves could not possess identical wills; then, if thy
will be God's will, Thou art That.

There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is written--
surely for our great comfort--"Love is the law, love under will."

This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the
nature of that Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by-
product of that Will; it does not contradict or supersede that Will;
and if apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis, it is the

Will that can guide us aright. Lo, while in the Book of the Law is
much Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is
almost like Love! Fighting most certainly is Love! "As brothers
fight ye!" All the manly races of the world understand this. The
Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, even orgiastic. There
is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. Mighty and terrible
and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon the sacred
lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the
Knight-Monks of Thelema.
                  Love is the law, love under will.
