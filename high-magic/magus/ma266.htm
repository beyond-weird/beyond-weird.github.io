<P>GEORGE RIPLEY, an <I>Englishman</I> by nation, and by profession a canon or monk of <I>Britlingthon</I>. His writings were all very good in their kind, being wrote exactly in the style of <I>Bacon</I>, only more allegorical. As he was no physician, he does not meddle with any thing of the preparations of that kind; but treats much of the cure of metals, which in his language is the purification and maturation thereof. He rigorously pursued <I>Geber's</I> and <I>Bacon's</I> principles, and maintained, for instance, with new evidence, that mercury is the universal matter of all metals; that this set over the fire, with the purest sulphur, will become gold, but that if either of them be sick or leprous, <I>i. e.</I> infected with any impurity, instead of gold, some other metal will be produced. He adds, that as mercury and sulphur are sufficient for the making of all metals: so of these may an universal medicine, or metal, be produced for curing of all the sick; which some mistakenly understood of an universal metal, efficacious in all the diseases of the human body.</P>
