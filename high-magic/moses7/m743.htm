<P>This was bequeathed as a testament to all the wise magicians, which all the old Fathers possessed and employed, to have and fulfill all things through the illustrious power of the mighty God Jehovah, as He, the great Monarch, gave to His creatures, who worship Him day and night with reverence and fear, who call loudly upon His name in secret, and sigh to Him as their origin, as of Him and from Him existing reasonable beings, as on the point of being involved with the pains of the elements, who strive after the highest being to and with God. To these He has given this, who will not forget Him in the pleasures of this world, who, still bearing suffering without forgetting the reality, nor the perishing lustre of the world.</P>
