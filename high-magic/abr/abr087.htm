<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Evil Spirits.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) MAGOT performs the Operations hereof</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) This is rather a fascination than anything else. Take the Symbol desired in your left hand and stroke the face therewith. Abraham further observes that such an Operation performed by an ordinary Magician would be easily seen through by the possessor of the Sacred Magic; while on the contrary this latter would be safe from detection by ordinary Sorcerers.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) The Student will note in these Squares the marked position of the Letter Q, as in many other cases where the effect aimed at seems to be rather a deception of the senses of others.</p>  
<p>No. 1 consists of 16 Squares from a Square of 25. ZAKEN means "old".</p>  
<p>No. 2 is a Gnomon of 16 Squares with the Letter Q added; from a Square of 72 Squares.--DISKENAH = "in the likeness of an old woman". It is to be remarked that this Square is rather oblong, 8 Squares long by 9 deep.</p>  
<p>No. 3 consists of 20 Squares from a Square of 49.--DISAKAN means "to cover up or hide," but were it DISAKAR it would mean "as one young".</p>  
<p>No. 4 consists of 10 Squares from a Square of 25 Squares.--IONEK means "thy dove".</p>  
<p>No. 5 consists of 16 Squares from a Square of 25.--BACUR = "a firstborn".</p>
