<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) ORIENS alone performs this Operation.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent perform the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) Place the Symbol of the Money you require in your purse, let it remain there for a short time, then put your right hand into your purse, and you will there find seven pieces of the class of money you have wished for. This Operation should not be performed more than three times in the day. The pieces of money you do not use will disappear, which is why you should not ask for several kinds of money at the same time. And if you spend it, both you and those into whose hands it passes will find it genuine.</p>  
<p>In another place Abraham says, that once only in your life you may ask your Guardian Angel for a large sum of money sufficient to represent a fortune; and that he himself had done so and obtained his request.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 consists of 17 from a Square of 25 Squares. SEQOR perhaps here means money.</p>  
<p>No. 2 consists of 10 Squares from a Square of 25. KESER <i>may</i> mean a "collection or heap".</p>  
<p>No. 3 consists of 19 Squares from a Square of 25. PESEP should be probably BESPR = "much, many".</p>  
<p>No. 4 is a Gnomon of 9 Squares from 25. MATBA probably means "let it be forthcoming, bring forth".</p>
