</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER XXX.</h3>  
<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Evil Spirits.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) MAGOT performs the Operations hereof.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent perform the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) No especial instructions are given by Abraham regarding this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 consists of 18 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. NAGINAH = "a stringed instrument".</p>  
<p>No. 2 consists of a Gnomon of 13 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. MEKOLAH = "Singing".</p>  
<p>No. 3 is a Gnomon of 13 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. NIGIGIN = "musical instruments," probably.</p>  
<p>No. 4 consists of 21 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. MECASEF means "enchantment".</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>This finishes the list of Symbols set down by Abraham the Jew, the which I have given in their entirety; but I must of my own initiative warn any who may endeavour to use these Signs, that unless animated by the purest and best motives they will find them react terribly against them; and that, if the preliminary period of Six Months' preparation advocated by Abra-Melin be not observed, the Symbols will be practically worthless in their hands; for, as will be observed, the Names in the Squares for the most part are simply the statement of the ends desired to be accomplished thereby.</p>

<p>Finally, I will quote the following passage from the "Key of Solomon the King":--</p>  
<p>"ACCURSED BE HE WHO TAKETH THE NAME OF GOD IN VAIN! ACCURSED BE HE WHO USETH THIS KNOWLEDGE UNTO AN EVIL END. BE HE ACCURSED IN THIS WORLD AND IN THE WORLD TO COME. AMEN. BE HE ACCURSED IN THE NAME WHICH HE HATH BLASPHEMED!"</p>
