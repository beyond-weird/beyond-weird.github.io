</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">NOTES TO CHAPTER XI.</h3>  
<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels, or by the Guardian Angel.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) MAGOTH alone executes the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) Many ancient Books of Magic, etc., have been lost or destroyed, in some cases by the wish of the Good Spirits, in others by the machinations of the Evil Spirits. By these Symbols you can have many supposed extinct works brought to you, Abraham states; but adds that he could never copy them, because the writing disappeared as fast as he wrote it; notwithstanding this he was permitted to read some of them.</p>  
<p>(<i>e</i>) No. 1 is a Square of 16 Squares. COLI, probably from Hebrew KLI, meaning the whole, in the sense of the whole Universe.</p>  
<p>No. 2 is a Square of 36 Squares.--SEARAH, perhaps from Hebrew SORH, a whirlwind; or perhaps from ShORH = terrible, and is also used to express a Kid, or a species of shaggy Satyr-like Demon, from the word being used to signify hair.</p>  
<p>No. 3 is a Gnomon of 13 Squares taken from a Square of 49 Squares.--KEHAHEK is probably from Hebrew KHCh, meaning to conceal, obscure, or shut up.</p>
