<p>(<i>a</i>) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested in part by the Angels, and in part also by the Evil Spirits.</p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) ORIENS, PAIMON, ARITON, and AMAIMON execute the Operations hereof by means of their common Ministers.</p>  
<p>(<i>c</i>) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chapter.</p>  
<p>(<i>d</i>) Name the place aloud to which you wish to travel, and place the Symbol upon your head under the bonnet or the hat; but take well heed that it does not fall from you, which would be very dangerous. Do not as a rule travel by night; and select a calm and serene day for the Operation.</p>
