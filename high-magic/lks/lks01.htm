<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE</H1>
<P>This translation of the FIRST BOOK of the "<I>Lemegeton</I>" which is now for the first time made accessible to students of TALISMANIC MAGIC was done, after careful collation and edition, from numerous <I>Ancient Manuscripts</I> in <I>Hebrew, Latin</I>, and <I>French</I>, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., by the order of the <I>Secret Chief</I> of the <I>Rosicrucian Order</I>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The G. H. Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the <I>Four Great Princes</I> (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient that the work should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The investigation of a competent Skryer into the house of our unhappy <I>Fra</I>., confirmed this divination; neither our <I>Fra</I>. nor his <I>Hermetic Mul</I>. were there seen; but only the terrible shapes of the evil <I>Adepts</I> S.V.A.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and H., whose original bodies having</P>

<P>been sequestered by Justice, were no longer of use to them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; but withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the Books M. and Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, a poet, and skilled student of <I>Magical Lore</I>, and an expert <I>Kabbalist</I>, to complete openly that which had been begun in secret.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This is that which is written: "His Bishoprick let another take." And again: "<I>Oculi Tetragammaton</I>." This is also that which is said: "Nomen Secundum refertur ad <I>Gebhurah</I>; qui est Rex <I>Bittul</I> atque Corruptio <I>Achurajim Patris et Matris</I> hoc indigitatur."</P>
<P>And so saying we wish you well.</P><DIR>

<P><A NAME="fn_0"></A><A HREF="lks01.htm#fr_0">3:1</A> Mr. A. E. Waite writes ("Real History Of The Rosicrucians," p. 426): "I beg leave to warn my readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be Rosicrucians are simply members of pseudo-fraternities, and that there is that difference between their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of a lie consists!" It is within the <I>Editor's</I> personal knowledge that Mr. Waite was (and still is probably) a member of a society claiming to be the R.C. fraternity As <I>Mr. Waite</I> constantly hints in his writing that he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the <I>syllogism</I>, whose premises are given above, is fair, if not quite formal.--ED.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1"></A><A HREF="lks01.htm#fr_1">3:2</A> It was owing to our <I>Fra</I>. receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up the <I>Arcana</I> of our <I>Fraternity</I> into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer to leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus easily imposed upon. (For by a childish and easy magical trick did S.V.A. persuade D.D.C.F. of that lie.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_2"></A><A HREF="lks01.htm#fr_2">4:1</A> He that is appointed to complete in secret that which had been begun openly is R.R., and to be heard of at the care of the Editor.</P>
