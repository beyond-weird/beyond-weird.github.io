INTRODUCTION
<p> This page is not an introduction to the tarot for readings. It is rather a 
  manual for the person who tends to put the tarot cards to use for spells. It 
  is a how-to page where you will find exact instruction on how to set up the 
  tarot cards to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>Most people know the tarot only as a tool for divination. Each of the tarot 
  cards represents a field of experience and/or a function in life. In a tarot 
  reading you shuffle the cards then you lay them out in a specific manner such 
  as the celtic cross method or the tree of life method. Then you judge each card 
  by its posistion in the layout and how it relates to the other cards. From this 
  you can then divine important facts about the person for whom you are reading.</p>
<p> All the following is about tarot spells.</p>
<p> When you give a tarot reading you channel energies from the universe towards 
  yourself. You use the cards as indicators of what the universe tells you. If 
  you do a spell with the tarot you use the cards as energy filters. They represent 
  the energies that you are about to send off. I have<br>
  mentioned above that each tarot card is a archetypal symbol that represents 
  a field of experince or a function or an idea. To combine tarot cards means 
  to combine ideas. Consequently the tarot cards are an ideal tool to creatively 
  act upon your universe in magical operations.</p>
<p> A magical operation is any action at a distance that involves the use of structural 
  links and life energy, or psychic power. Therefore, to be effective in magical 
  work, you need a source of life energy, a psychic link to the target of your 
  magical operation (unless the target of the magical<br>
  operation is present), and a structural link that represents the specific action 
  that you desire. The success of every magical work depends on these three key 
  factors.</p>
<p> * The better the psychic link to your target is, the easier you can influence 
  it with a magical operation, or spell. Psychic links for targetting are structural 
  links that are near identical with the<br>
  target. Hair and fingernails contain genetic code that is unique for every individual, 
  therefore, these items are an excellent structural or psychic link to the target. 
  This genetic code allows you to connect with every cell in the body of the target 
  person. Clothing has a similar effect. This is so because clothing has skin 
  rubbings in it even after it went through the washer and drier. Other good psychic 
  links with the target are visualization, the writing down of the name (which 
  involves visualiztion), and radionic settings. These psychic links are not of 
  the identical kind, but of an &quot;equivalent nature.&quot;</p>
<p> Equivalent structural links are an excellent substitute in cases where near 
  identical links are missing. Photos are somewhat in between two extremes that 
  we have just described. There is more information on structural links in the 
  course Magic of the Future.</p>
<p><br>
  * For a strong effect of the spell, you need a strong source of life energy. 
  Many magicians create their own energy as they need it. The creating of psychic 
  energy, or life energy, is an integral part of every magical ritual. Magicians 
  use a variety of methods to create life energy. These methods range from chanting, 
  dancing, sex magical practices, and processes of visualization all the way to 
  the sacrificing of animals. A most effective way to generate life energy continuously 
  is the Welz Generator which we promote highly here (see Gadgets &amp; Gizmos).</p>
<p><br>
  * The third, equally important, factor is the &quot;energy filter.&quot; This 
  energy filter is a structural representation of a desired action or of an energy 
  (entity) that works toward a desired result. The structural link to the action, 
  or energy filter, needs to be a correct representation of the intention of the 
  magician. Otherwise the spell may not be effective or it may have an unexpected 
  outcome. (We will be using tarot cards as our &quot;energy filters&quot;).</p>
<p> For all these reasons, to be a good magician means years of training, practice 
  and study.</p>
<p> Many of the spell books on the market make the task of casting effective spells 
  seem easy. However all too often would-be magicians get only meager results. 
  This is so because they are not capable of creating the psychic connection with 
  the target or they cannot generate a sufficiently large amount of psychic energy 
  for the spell.</p>
<p> With the invention of the WELZ GENERATOR this situation has changed dramatically. 
  Now even a beginner can cast effective spells. The Welz Generator creates sufficient 
  psychic energy to lock on to the target, and to actively effect the outcome 
  of every spell AT THE TURN OF A DIAL!</p>
<p> To do magical work successfully you need to have the following:</p>
<p> * A good structural link to the target of your work.<br>
  * A good power source for life energy.<br>
  * An appropriate filter that correctly represents the energy that you send to 
  the target of your work.</p>
<p> It is up to you to find a good structural link. It may be hair, a photo, or 
  a transfer design that the person whom you help carries with him/her. For the 
  life energy you have one of the Welz Generators, or energy charged within some 
  sort of battery such as a crystal.</p>
