<b><font size=+1>The 7 Levels of Reality. <font color="red">Part 1</font></font>
<p>The levels we exist in daily are divided into 7 levels.
<br>These levels are ones we pass through every second of every day.
<br>With thought we can change our level to any of the 7 we choose.
<p>Level 1 (inverse 7) - Bum - The lowest of the levels. Sees and hates
all the other levels.
<p>Level 2 (inverse 6) -&nbsp; Drug Addict - Hides from all levels and distortions.
<p>Level 3 (inverse 5) - Artist - Sees but doesn't understand.
<p>Level 4 (inverse 4) -&nbsp; Worker - Deny's seeing anything.
<p>Level 5 (inverse 3) - Follower - Sees distortions from 6 and knows they
have power.
<p>Level 6 (inverse 2) - Strength / Leader - Sees and understands peoples distortions.
Most of the great leaders of the world are level 6.
<p>Level 7 (inverse 1) - Color Green - Powerful - Can not be attacked -
Can control all other levels. Can be reached only through intense focus
of the mind. Once in the level everything comes into focus. All levels,
even those in-between the lower ones become visible. All other levels must
do what the Level 7 mind wants. There is no questioning the Level 7 mind.<br><br>
Note: Levels 1-6 are different by degrees. They go down and get less focused and open to more distortions.<br>
Many things are possible for the Level 7 mind.<br><br>
Definitions:
Distortions = Normal Reality that we create around ourselves.<br>
Levels = States of Mind/Reality that we move through.<br><br>
