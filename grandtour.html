  <font color="#FFFFFF">For several years articles have been appearing about secret 
  government bases where exotic space weapons and U.S.-made saucers are built 
  and tested, but always the testimony for such was "off the record" or from "sources 
  who cannot be named." So I determined to go see for myself. On April 9 of 1992, 
  I set out in my S-10 Blazer on a six state grand tour of reported Southwest 
  secret sites. The reality turned out to be much more startling than what I had 
  seen in print until now. For the curious or suspicious, my background is that 
  I am a research and clinical psychologist in private practice in Sacramento, 
  California. I have had a hobby interest in UFO's since 1947, and a research 
  interest in extraterrestrial encounters since 1989. My formal education is in 
  Psychology (Ph.D.), Education (M.S.Ed.), Social Work (M.S.W.) and Philosophy 
  (B.A.). My knowledge of physics, astronomy, nuclear physics, gravity, SDI, and 
  the Intelligence and military cover-up workings is self-taught by reading books 
  such as Intelligent Life in the Universe, Carl Sagan & I.S. Shklovskii, The 
  Anti-Gravity Handbook, D. Hatcher Childress, The Puzzle Palace, James Bamford, 
  The Cult of Counter-terrorism, Neil Livingstone, and Missing the Target: SDI 
  in the 1990's, Union of Concerned Scientists, as well as L. Fletcher Prouty's 
  JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot To Assassinate John F. Kennedy. I have never 
  been in the military or intelligence services. I am a loyal, but disquieted 
  American. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The Grand Tour took place between April 9-15, 1992. 
  The sites reconnoitered include: Tonopah USAF Air Defense Command Headquarters, 
  Tonopah Test Range, the edge of Area 51 and S-4 (Groom and Papoose Lakes bases), 
  Archuletta Mesa outside N.M., Los Alamos National Laboratories, Kirtland 
  Air Force Base, the Western Regional Headquarters of the Department of Energy 
  (SDI), Sandia National Laboratories, Defense Nuclear Agency headquarters, the 
  National Atomic Museum, the National Solar Observatory, U.S. Army's Sacramento 
  Peak Frequency Surveillance Station, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the 
  site of the Very Large Baseline Array near Pietown, N.M, and the Northrop saucer 
  plant near Lancaster, CA. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> My selection of target sites was based on information 
  from articles about Stealth and Black Budget aircraft bases and Star Wars weapons 
  research and development sites appearing in newspapers such as the L.A. Times, 
  and various magazines such as Aviation Week and Space Technology, Popular Mechanics, 
  UFO MAGAZINE, and MUFON Journal. I used many useful leads from Howard Blum's 
  excellent Out There, as well as Timothy Good's essential Above Top Secret. I 
  also sifted out as best I could the verifiable information from the unverifiable 
  in William Hamilton III's Cosmic Top Secret. Another source was a November 26, 
  1991 lecture on "The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" given by NASA 
  Ames Research Center's Dr. Jill Tarter, whose too vigorous protesting of Blum's 
  book Out There only increased my suspicion that Blum was onto something. Additional 
  information sources were conversations with two CIA officers I have met, as 
  well as from my years inside the University of California as a graduate student 
  and instructor. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> My reconnoitering was done without any formal guides 
  or inside informants. As a follower of Native American spirituality, I asked 
  for and apparently received guidance and protection from the spiritual forces. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> My first objective was the town of Tonopah, Nevada, 
  a gateway to Black Budget aerospace/SDI projects. If you draw a line between 
  Lancaster, CA, Arco, ID, Denver, and Alamogordo, NM, most Black Budget aerospace/SDI 
  projects are built, tested and based within this quadrangle, according to my 
  research. Although Tonopah is a tiny town with mining as its ostensible economy, 
  it houses an Air Force Air Defense Command headquarters. This is a paradox, 
  since Nellis Air Force Base (the nearest official USAF facility) is 180 miles 
  south. Unless, of course, there is a secret USAF presence at the north end of 
  the Nevada Test Range requiring aerospace defense. Which there is. Also spotted 
  was the "Shuttle to Sandia." Very interesting, since Sandia National Labs is 
  two states away in Albuquerque. Unless, of course, there is a secret Sandia 
  presence nearby. Which there is. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> From Tonopah I drove east 15 miles on U.S. 6 to the 
  turnoff to the Tonopah Test Range. The entrance sign misleadingly gives the 
  impression that they test small rockets there. But after driving 12 miles south 
  on the entrance road I came to a huge sprawling base operated not by the Department 
  of Defense but rather by Sandia National Laboratories for the Department of 
  Energy (DOE). "Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is AT&T," according to SNL 
  public information officer Joanne Pigg. (Personal communication, 04/20/92.) 
  Yes, AT&T is the corporation behind the application of physics research to Star 
  Wars weapons. When AT&T reaches out to touch someone, it may be with one of 
  their electromagnetic pulse weapons. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> By the front gate are 30 huge two-story buildings where 
  Test Range workers are headquartered. Through binoculars (7X35 power) I could 
  see downrange five miles where an equally large additional buildings complex 
  was located. To the south and east extend hundreds of square miles for operational 
  testing of DOE weapons, such as electromagnetic pulse, particle beam, tactical 
  fusion (Leonard Stringfield, in The UFO Report, T. Good, ed.) and laser. Strategic 
  nuclear weapons are tested 100 miles farther south at another DOE facility, 
  the Nevada Test Site, while U.S.-made saucers are test flown 100 miles southeast, 
  over the Groom and Papoose Lakes bases. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The guards at the Tonopah Test Range were not dressed 
  in military or police uniform, but rather wore desert camouflage jumpsuits with 
  a cryptic shoulder patch reading "ASI-SWAT." A military convoy was let through 
  the gate and headed downrange. When I approached the main gate on foot, the 
  two guards were surely and aggressively poised. They carried strange weapons 
  which I have never seen before, although I am familiar with the appearance of 
  U.S. and international military, police and elite unit weapons, as found in, 
  for example, Soldier of Fortune magazine. Their weapons looked like a fat, black, 
  cylindrical oversized rifle stock (about 5" diameter), about a yard long, but 
  no barrel or muzzle at the end. Not wanting to experience this weapon pointed 
  any closer to me, I accepted their refusal to let me pass through, and retreated. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> About 80 miles east of Tonopah Test Range on State HWY 
  375 is the hamlet of Rachel, NV. Mostly a mobile home complex housing workers 
  employed at Area 51, Rachel's central spot is the Little A'Le'Inn bar and restaurant. 
  Proprietors Joe and Pat Travis are quite informative about Area 51 and host 
  the Air Force personnel who come there to drink after work. The walls of the 
  Little A'Le'Inn are a veritable museum of USAF unit insignia, UFO photographs, 
  drawings and souvenirs, as well as autographed photos of UFO researchers and 
  investigative journalists, such as George Knapp of Las Vegas radio/television. 
  Joe told me of a UFO having come down once at night after closing and illuminated 
  the entire interior of their restaurant. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I then proceeded 25 miles southeast to the Groom Lake 
  dirt road turnoff, marked by the infamous black mailbox. Using USGS topographic 
  maps (Pahranagat Range) I carefully drove west on the dirt roads towards the 
  Groom Lake base. While still five miles away from the military reservation boundary, 
  I encountered two men in camouflage jumpsuits armed with rifles, sitting in 
  an unmarked Ford Bronco with a lightbar on the roof, parked off the roadbed 
  facing me. Just as I drove past them, my left rear tire collapsed and I rolled 
  to a stop. The tire had a side wall penetration, although the tread was good. 
  Nothing on the clear dirt road could have caused a sidewall blowout. I concluded 
  that the tire had been shot by one of these men. After a minute the camouflaged 
  duo did a U-turn, drove up next to my vehicle as I was changing the tire, and 
  sarcastically asked, "Anything wrong?." I was next questioned as to whether 
  I had a badge, and whether I was "headed up ahead." When I said I had no badge, 
  they said "It's no use going up ahead." I learned that there is a guarded closed 
  gate at the military reservation boundary. A USAF Lt. Colonel James W. Hutchinson 
  is Installation Commander in charge of Area 51. (USAF warning document, Area 
  51 issue, 1992.) </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Since it was late afternoon I retreated until dark, 
  then returned and parked prudently about a quarter-mile east of the Bronco and 
  got out my binoculars to observe the ridgeline of the Groom Range above Areas 
  51 and S-4 from 9:00-10:30 p.m., April 9. After a half-hour I spotted an intense 
  burning bright orange-gold round light rise up vertically from behind the Groom 
  Mountains. It hovered several minutes, drifted slowly south about 1000 feet, 
  then slowly descended vertically behind the mountains. This object had the same 
  color and shape, and was viewed from the same direction, as the object photographed 
  by researcher Gary Schulz, who enlarged and computer-enhanced his photo to reveal 
  a flying disc with a cupola on top, surrounded by an ionization haze of light. 
  Schulz' photographs of what he identifies as a HPAC (Human Powered Alien Craft) 
  hang on the wall of the Little A'Le'Inn, and appear in Cosmic Top Secret. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Soon a second brilliantly shining round object rose 
  vertically and hovered about 500 feet above the ridgeline. This object was strobing 
  and emitting a blue-white intense light apparently from the skin of the craft. 
  It then began a series of incredible, impossibly blindingly fast pendulum, zigzag 
  and back-and-forth maneuvers at fraction of a second intervals, covering perhaps 
  900 feet at a "jump." The object executed 180-degree turns and appeared almost 
  to be in two places at once. After this dazzling aerobatics performance it settled 
  down to hovering awhile, then resumed the gyrations again. Both episodes of 
  gyrations lasted over a minute each. Finally the object hovered motionless, 
  then began flying downrange south at a constant altitude and direction at about 
  80 mph. I tracked it through my binoculars for about 30 miles before it became 
  indistinguishable from the starfield. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> About a half-hour after it disappeared, a third brilliant 
  round object, glowing with the same burning bright orange-gold color, rose above 
  the Groom Range, hovered, drifted slowly, then began strobing. Then it began 
  gliding downrange at a constant altitude and speed of 80 mph, but with somewhat 
  irregularly spaced erratic jumps forward. Also odd was that the appearance of 
  the craft alternated between strobes; on one phase it was a bright sharply defined 
  orb of orange - gold light, on the alternate phase it was a smudgy golden smear 
  of light. It repeated this phase shifting all the way downrange. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> These craft were navigated in a conservative and slow 
  fashion, and did not display the confident maneuvering and extremely rapid departure 
  style so often reported for extraterrestrial UFO's. Thus I concluded these are 
  the U.S.-manufactured discs at a primitive stage of technology and/or pilot 
  mastery. On the other hand, the extreme hyper-fast aerobatics in place of the 
  one craft indicates that inertial forces, and therefore gravity, have been overcome 
  by these craft. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> My next destination was Archuletta Mesa just north of 
  NM. Reported in Blum's Out There and Good's The UFO Report as an underground 
  base, Archuletta Mesa straddles the New Mexico-Colorado border. I drove around 
  the mesa and discovered a mysterious "ranch" on the north side near the base 
  of the mesa. The "Redding R Ranch" is supposedly a buffalo raising outfit. However, 
  in the front yard of the ranch between the road and the two ranch buildings 
  were four odd, 25 foot high guard towers on stilts, defining the four corners 
  of the inner property. No movement or personnel were detected. The ranch ranges 
  for two miles along the road, with four fancy expensive wrought-iron gates and 
  arches with "Redding R Ranch" spelled in wrought iron, spaced at intervals along 
  the fence line. However, three of these gates lead to nowhere, either bordering 
  a cliff over a creek or bordering a dense forest with no road behind the gate. 
  A self - confessed Intelligence operative I interviewed in 1992, Dr. John Alexander, 
  working as a member of the Board of Directors of PSITECH, (a commercial intelligence 
  company using psychics with remote viewing powers), expressed great interest 
  in seeing my photographs of the "Ranch" and "had heard of it" in his intelligence 
  work. I shared with him that a remote viewer in Sacramento, CA I consult with, 
  Nancy Matz, had spotted several levels of excavated chambers in the mesa, but 
  that there had been a great disturbance inside the mountain which caused some 
  of the chambers to cave in on others. Dr. Alexander replied to this that "we 
  set off a nuclear explosion inside the mountain" (personal communication, 06/16/92), 
  but then added the dis-information that "it was to search for oil." (Oil is 
  found deep under the ground, not up in the air on a 2000 foot high sandstone 
  mesa. Thus, I did not completely penetrate the mystery of Archuletta Mesa (Dulce), 
  but there appears to be more there than meets the eye. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Next I headed back into New Mexico to reconnoiter Los 
  Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), where theoretical research having weapons 
  applications is conducted for the Department of Energy (DOE) by the University 
  of California. (The University also operates Lawrence Livermore Laboratories 
  in California for the same purposes, specializing in laser and nuclear fusion 
  research.) A huge sprawling complex covering much of Los Alamos County, Los 
  Alamos Labs stretches for 5 miles by 13 miles, and, according to John Alexander, 
  has extensive underground facilities in addition to the surface installations, 
  (Personal communication, 06/16/92). LANL retains a heavy, but not exclusive, 
  emphasis on nuclear research. It helps to explain why this country is not making 
  more progress in safely disposing of nuclear waste that there is one small building 
  at LANL dedicated to Nuclear Waste Management Research, while there are hundreds 
  dedicated to making more waste. DOE "No Trespassing" signs, with dire penalties, 
  are everywhere at LANL, as are radiation warning signs. Certain curious anomalies 
  were noted at LANL. Building T10 houses the Center for Human Genome Studies, 
  and the HIV (AIDS) Database : a pair of rather strange enterprises for a military 
  weapons-oriented research complex to be involved in, rather than the National 
  Institutes of Health. One cannot help being reminded of the rumors that AIDS 
  is a biological weapon gone amok. Even more curious is another building which 
  houses LANL's Theoretical Biology and Biophysics studies. Perhaps less curious 
  if the rumor is true that the extraterrestrial corpses from the crashed UFO 
  near Corona, NM were brought to Los Alamos for study. Los Alamos' Theoretical 
  Biology department may be linked to NASA Ames Research Center's exobiology studies, 
  which include having constructed lifelike figures of alternative evolutionary 
  models of what intelligent life may look like on other planets (Blum, H., Out 
  There). </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Besides nukes and exotic biology LANL also researches 
  military applications of intense magnetic fields at its National High Magnetic 
  Field Laboratory, (a prerequisite to gravity/anti-gravity research). And the 
  military connection at LANL is not subtle. The Air Force has its ATAC Technical 
  Support Facility there, staffed and guarded 7 days a week. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another anomaly at Los Alamos is its central nuclear 
  reactor. This is the only reactor I have ever seen with personnel quarters (extremely 
  secure) located right next to the reactor, in violation of the principle of 
  keeping optimal separation between persons and radiation. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The theoretical weapons physics of Los Alamos and Lawrence 
  Livermore Laboratories is translated into actual working models of high tech 
  weapons at Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque. So I headed for Albuquerque, 
  arguably a center of the Black Budget/SDI effort. Located on the southeast edge 
  of town is Kirtland Air Force Base. Kirtland provides cover for and houses: 
  the Southwest Regional Office of the Department of Energy (DOE), Sandia National 
  Laboratories (SNL), the Defense Nuclear Agency, the Interservice Nuclear Weapons 
  School, and DOE's National Atomic Museum. To say that DOE and SNL keep a low 
  profile is an understatement. They do not even list themselves in the Albuquerque 
  phone book, although other federal agencies have long listings of even minor 
  departments. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I entered the Kirtland Air Force Base complex through 
  its main gate after getting a free pass offered to any civilian who wants to 
  visit the National Atomic Museum or SNL's Solar Research Power Tower inside. 
  If one happens not to be able to help passing various DOE, USAF, SNL or DNA 
  facilities and weapons test sites on the way in or out, oh, well, opportunity 
  knocks. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Over the roof of the Department of Energy Regional Headquarters 
  fly three flags, the U.S., the DOE, and the AT&T! Yes, the AT&T horizontal stripes 
  globe logo flies alongside, because AT&T is Sandia National Laboratories, which 
  is where a large part of DOE effort in the Southwest takes place. Although the 
  government likes to tout its nuclear safety record, the DOE is not even capable 
  of keeping its own regional administrative headquarters building free of contamination, 
  as photographic evidence shows. Contaminated or not, the DOE is secured like 
  a fortress, with checkpoint guard posts and a personnel entry cubicle one must 
  enter, lock the door, punch in a code, then exit another door, all before walking 
  to the front door of the headquarters building. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Since I could not enter even the main lobby area of 
  DOE or SNL headquarters, I traveled a quarter-mile farther to the National Atomic 
  Museum (NAM). The nuclear physicists and military at Los Alamos and Sandia Labs 
  are so proud of their history of nuclear "achievements" that they proudly display 
  information I had presumed was classified (and may still be, elsewhere). For 
  example, The U.S. now has hydrogen bombs downsized as small as a RV propane 
  tank, and which could easily fit in an Army duffel bag. Or, as Abu Nidal knows, 
  in a bus terminal storage locker. Even more amazing, in view of Lawrence Livermore 
  Laboratories' continuing dis-information campaign that "we're still working 
  on containing nuclear fusion," was NAM's revelation that the U.S. has since 
  1987 been producing controlled nuclear fusion, and that it is self-sustaining(!) 
  and contained by a hyper-strong magnetic field. They use lasers to implode fissile 
  material and produce fusion. This is an inexhaustible and rather compact energy 
  source, and may be the powerplant for the gravity-defying craft I saw at Area 
  51. Another NAM revelation with Star Wars weapons implications (and applications) 
  is that SNL has achieved advanced particle acceleration energy capabilities 
  that can deliver a 100,000,000,000,000 (100 trillion) volt burst of ions using 
  a lithium diode one inch thick. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Across the street (appropriately) from the National 
  Atomic Museum is the Interservice Nuclear Weapons School, where all branches 
  of the armed services can learn how to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons 
  must no longer be understood to mean only hydrogen bombs, but also Star Wars 
  weaponry which uses nuclear fusion as its power source. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Which leads us next to the immense sprawling complex 
  of Sandia National Laboratories. SNL and its test ranges extend south and east 
  of DOE headquarters for over a hundred square miles, and take up most of what 
  is labeled "Kirtland Air Force Base." SNL has project buildings every half-mile 
  in every direction out to the horizon. Activities identified by sign include 
  mostly weapons application research in nuclear, nuclear transport, magnetic, 
  solar (yes, solar weapons!), electromagnetic pulse, laser and particle beam 
  energy. At the Solar Power Tower laboratory SNL boasts of a heliostat (solar 
  collector-concentrator device) which can burn through 1" thick hard metal plating 
  in 26 seconds. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> But the piece-de-resistance of Star Wars weapons research 
  applications I found was "Project ARIES, the Advanced Research Electromagnetic 
  Pulse (EMP) Simulator Site," where a two blocks long device was built for the 
  Defense Nuclear Agency by Edgerton, Germhausen & Greer (EG&G). </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> EG&G is a shadowy corporation involved (along with Wackenhut 
  Corporation) in security for Areas 51 and S-4, (personal communication with 
  security officers at EG&G and at Wackenhut 03/14/92), Black Budget weapons operations 
  like Project ARIES, and in maintaining various nuclear facilities for the U.S. 
  government (Wildfire, 6:1, Spring, 1992). The EMP weapon consists of a 1 1/2 
  block long barrel horizontally supported on a wooden (non-conductive) trestle 
  25 feet high, connected to a two-story tower building, connected in turn to 
  an immense electrical apparatus with huge arms and massive connecting cables 
  looking like a gigantic Van de Graaf generator. The long-rumored electromagnetic 
  pulse weapon spotted at last! Using fusion power and engineered to 100 trillion 
  volt bursts, it could arguably overpower even the exotic technology of an extraterrestrial 
  UFO. It is clearly overkill to defeat a mere incoming CIS (formerly, USSR) ballistic 
  missile, for which nuclear tipped sprint intercept missiles suffice. While driving 
  around trying to find my way back from the solar weapons lab, I encountered 
  the famous Manzano Mountain Weapons Storage facility, an entire mountain tunneled 
  into for storage of various high security items, such as nuclear weapons and, 
  according to Timothy Good, retrieved UFO's (Above Top Secret). Manzano is surrounded 
  by three separate high razor wire tipped fences with bare earth zones between, 
  presumably with motion sensors embedded. Armed personnel in jeeps constantly 
  patrol the area. The security at Manzano is in high contrast to the rather porous-to-nonexistent 
  security elsewhere at Sandia. At the northern end of Manzano is the notorious 
  Coyote Canyon Test Site, where extremely classified Air Force, DNA, DOE and 
  SNL research takes place. At the entrance was a sign designating the Defender 
  Challenge project. This is the area where a UFO was spotted by USAF personnel 
  hovering low in 1979 (Above Top Secret, T. Good). Peering part way into Coyote 
  Canyon by binoculars, I could see a strange metallic ball 20 feet high resting 
  on the ground sheltered by a flat tin roof above, supported by four poles surrounding 
  the huge sphere. Its purpose is unknown. Whatever the research at Coyote Canyon 
  is, it has made the water in the area unfit to drink or even wash your hands 
  in. Because of the off-limits signs I did not enter Coyote Canyon or other high 
  security canyons around, so I cannot fully report on all that is going on at 
  these Sandia sites. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Leaving Sandia, I headed south towards Alamogordo, to 
  the National Solar Observatory (NSO) at Sunspot, NM. Located at top of Sacramento 
  Peak 9200' above Alamogordo, NSO is another low profile facility. Its staffing 
  include Air Force science officers, who monitor the effects of the Sun's electromagnetic 
  radiation fields on geophysical and geomagnetic disturbances, on the operation 
  of spacecraft and of satellite orbit stability, as well as on space flight operations 
  (NSO pamphlet, 1992). Under the entrance sign of the Observatory is placed an 
  additional small sign which reads "Umbra," the National Security Agency's highest 
  security classification (The Puzzle Palace, J. Bamford). A thousand feet east 
  of the NSO is the Army Sacramento Peak Frequency Surveillance Station, the entrance 
  to which has several signs forbidding entrance, with severe penalties. This 
  station monitors electromagnetic (EM) communications and telemetry on and over 
  White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and NASA's secret Johnson 
  Space City complex. My remote viewer consultant noted underground facilities 
  at the Surveillance Station and EM force field generation, which may explain 
  why there was no cricket or forest sounds near this ELMINT (electromagnetic 
  intelligence) facility, probably actually operated by the National Security 
  Agency. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range and 
  NASA's Johnson Space City were highly secure and off-limits, and I was not able 
  to reconnoiter them. My next destination lay in western New Mexico. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I explored the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 
  (NROA), whose Very Large Array consists of 27 huge "receiving" dishes 82 feet 
  wide, on support towers which move around on railroad tracks. Each is as tall 
  as a twelve-story building. Capable of different configurations, the dishes 
  I saw were arrayed in an inverted-T configuration, each arm of which stretched 
  for one mile, with the longest arm pointed due north. The stated purpose of 
  this facility is to collect "weak radio waves from celestial sources." This 
  is presented to the outsider as meaning exclusively mapping the heavens by locating 
  stars and energized gas fields in space which emit EM radiation in the radio 
  frequency. However, as with other sites on this tour, NROA is not your average 
  boring observatory. Parked adjacent to the headquarters was an Army truck with 
  NROA insignia on the door, and two ambulances with NROA insignia also. (The 
  handful of astronomers working here must have a terrible occupational accident 
  record!) Further insight into what is going on here is provided by NASA Ames 
  Research Center spokesperson Dr. Jill Tarter, who revealed (during a presentation 
  at the University of California, Davis on November 26, 1991) that the United 
  States would announce on October 12, 1992 that it is turning on its radiotelescopes 
  to listen for intelligent transmissions from space. This effort was timed for 
  Columbus' 500th Anniversary of discovering the New World. Cute, huh? Except 
  that this is dis-information. Actually, the U.S. government has been funding 
  and conducting the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) for years 
  (Out There, H. Blum). One could speculate that the purpose of this upcoming 
  high-profile government announcement is to create the fig leaf for "uncovering" 
  ET communications, and finally the open admission by the government of extraterrestrial-government 
  contact. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> What is not speculation is the evidence, including physical 
  evidence, I obtained that the government's NROA dishes are also being used to 
  transmit super-powerful signals into space, specifically towards the direction 
  just above the low north horizon. One clue came when I was having dinner at 
  the Datil restaurant next to four astronomers from NROA. One was complaining 
  about trying to get time on a radio dish to do his research. But while I was 
  at NROA all 27 dishes were pointed away from the main part of the sky, and directed 
  toward a target above the low north horizon. A photo of NROA displayed at their 
  headquarters again shows all 27 dishes pointed at that same low north horizon 
  angle. Why this persistent focus on one area of sky when there is such competition 
  for time on the dishes? Another clue is the location of NROA on the desolate 
  Plains of San Agustin, a silent region deliberately chosen for its remoteness 
  from cities with their radio stations and other EM radiation. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The physical evidence was obtained as I left the NROA. 
  As I was about two miles from the Very Large Array, with both my FM and CB radios 
  on, the most intense screeching howling sounds I have ever heard come out of 
  either radio blanketed both FM and CB simultaneously and excruciatingly. My 
  CB meter went way farther into the red than I have ever seen it go before. This 
  howling screech continued for several minutes. I could not believe my ears. 
  How could NROA allow such powerful EM signals which would interfere with their 
  listening to delicate radio waves from space? Finally I turned off the radios 
  until I reached Pietown, 21 miles northwest. Then I turned both radios on again 
  and again heard the deafening screech, which lasted an additional two minutes. 
  Then mercifully it stopped. After it ended, both radios were functioning perfectly, 
  sent and received well, and I have never heard that noise again. It then occurred 
  to me that NROA is not only receiving signals from space, but sending them! 
  Given the rule that EM field strength diminishes algebraically with distance, 
  the sending power from the NROA dishes is extraordinary (to swamp the CB and 
  FM frequencies at 21 miles), as befits a signal intended to penetrate into space. 
  Whom is the government signaling? And why is the government lying about SETI? 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> At Pietown, NM, an eye blink of four houses and one 
  boarded up store, the government is supposed to be building a much huger radiotelescope 
  complex, the Very Large Baseline Array, which will connect and harness the reach 
  of radiotelescopes from Hawaii to West Virginia, and from Puerto Rico to New 
  Mexico (NROA Exhibit data, 1992). This will create an "antenna" with a "dish 
  size" equivalent to almost one-eighth of the globe. The Very Large Baseline 
  Array was due to be completed this year, but I saw no radiotelescopes. The only 
  construction I could find involved huge pipes (10 foot diameter) being prepared 
  for placement underground in some oversize tunnel works. The purpose is unknown, 
  the project having no explanatory sign. What's really going on at Pietown I 
  cannot say. So I headed west to my final destination, in California's aerospace 
  Black Budget Palmdale-Lancaster region. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Sixty miles north of Los Angeles, in the Tehachapi Mountains 
  east of Edwards Air Force Base, lies the Tejon Ranch, sprawling for approximately 
  600 square miles. There the Northrop Aircraft Corporation has its secret saucer 
  manufacturing works, according to researcher William Hamilton III in his book, 
  Cosmic Top Secret. Bill was right. I saw the same intensely burning bright orange-gold 
  craft test flown there as I had seen above Areas 51/S-4. Following Bill's directions 
  I proceeded seven miles west from Lancaster on HWY 138 to Road 190, then three 
  miles north to the Kern County line. Staked out with binoculars between 3:00 
  and 5:00 a.m. on April 15, I observed four ultra-bright orange-gold orbs rise 
  and traverse a brief 1 1/2 mile test loop. At intervals of about a half-hour, 
  each orb took off and plied its course. The first three took off from what appeared 
  to be the southwest hanger area of the Northrop complex. The fourth one took 
  off from the northeast staging area. On the ground each craft was not glowing 
  at first, but appeared in the full moonlight like a parked airliner frame with 
  backlit "porthole windows." Estimated width of craft is 50 feet. Then as each 
  began to rise, it began glowing intensely all over its frame, as though the 
  frame itself (or an ionizing field around the frame) were emitting light. Its 
  intensity increased proportionately to the power demand of rising from the ground 
  vertically to approximately 200 feet above the plant. At this altitude and at 
  maximum brightness the craft hovered, then slowly began to glide at about 15 
  mph in a southwest direction for 1 1/2 miles, stopped, then swung around revealing 
  its round bottom side briefly which emitted even more intense light. Then each 
  craft traversed back at steady altitude to the staging area, hovered, then descended 
  vertically slowly to the ground. Upon landing each then stopped emitting bright 
  light except for the dim backlit "portholes." The fourth craft took its loop 
  in a northeasterly direction. These loops appeared to be very brief and cautious 
  test runs to be sure the craft actually flew, before shipping them off to Area 
  S-4 for full field test proving, and use to join a growing fleet of U.S. saucers.

<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now I had completed my six state tour and seen the Star 
  Wars and U.S. saucer facilities. What does it all mean? </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I believe that UFO's, Star Wars weapons and U.S. saucers 
  are interrelated, like a three-legged stool. As investigator Leonard Stringfield 
  states in Timothy Good's The UFO Report (1989): "Star Wars, ostensibly conceived 
  as a defensive system against Russian missile attacks, may have had from its 
  beginning a 'defensive' UFO connection." Clearly, given the dramatic increase 
  in Strategic Defense Initiative Office funding, (a 33% increase in each of the 
  last three years (Missing the Target:SDI in the 1990's, Union of Concerned Scientists)), 
  while there has been a dramatic drop in the Soviet missile threat since 1989 
  as the USSR fell apart, the Union of Concerned Scientists concluded that "there 
  is no rationale for an SDI system as large as that proposed either by Congress...or 
  the Bush administration." This anomaly further points to a different agenda 
  for SDI than stopping CIS missiles or Third World terrorists. That agenda, I 
  believe, is weapons "countermeasures" capability against extraterrestrials and 
  their UFO's. SDI "countermeasures" include nuclear, laser, electromagnetic pulse 
  and particle beam weapons. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Documentary evidence of such agenda appears to have 
  been inadvertently provided by NASA when the astronauts of the Shuttle Discovery 
  transmitted to Earth video camera footage of UFO's traversing just above Earth 
  atmosphere. One UFO suddenly makes a 90-degree turn to the right and accelerates 
  off into deeper space, just a second before a burst of shaped pulse high energy 
  streaks up from Earth towards the spot where the UFO would have been if it had 
  not radically changed course. Other UFO's are shown being shot at by visibly 
  energized EM weapon bursts. This videotape was shown on NBC's Hard Copy program 
  of June 5, 1992, and narrated by UFO Magazine Contributing Editor Don Ecker. 
  A Star Wars weapon shooting at a UFO above Earth's atmosphere? It looked that 
  way to Don Ecker, and from my research it looks that way to me. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The assembling of a fleet of U.S. saucers in Nevada 
  appears to be a related effort to develop capacity to do combat with extraterrestrial 
  UFO's on technologically similar terms. Compelling evidence also exists that 
  the assembling of high tech weapons under the appropriately named Star Wars 
  program is precisely to make war on extraterrestrials. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> What is the motive for the Shadow Government's war on 
  extraterrestrials? Richard Hoagland, former editor of Star & Sky magazine and 
  consultant to NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center, explains. "There is a great 
  deal of naiveté about the forces in our society that do not want this knowledge, 
  even in the form of a very useful technology, to get out." He notes that there 
  are "interlocking institutions whose job it is to keep themselves in business. 
  And they do not take likely to this ET technology. After all, how do people 
  stay in power? Because they define the universe as limited, rare and scarce 
  and then put a price tag on it. Then some people are put in charge of doling 
  out the scarce precious thing; other people buy it at whatever the market will 
  bear. And you have a really neat system for controlling people." (Wildfire, 
  6:1, Spring, 1992). </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Is the Shadow Government's aggressive and paranoid SDI 
  response the one we want made in our name to visits by intelligent life from 
  other planets? Is that a good use for $80 billion of our tax dollars? (SDI Budget, 
  1993-2005, Union of Concerned Scientists, op. cit.). As Edmund Burke once stated, 
  "All that is necessary for evil to prevail is for enough good men <and women> 
  to do nothing." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Something we can do to expose and oppose this evil is 
  demanding of our elected representatives that the Black Budget be opened to 
  full Congressional and public scrutiny and debate. This also should include 
  the Intelligence budgets, particularly NSA, NRO, CIA and DIA. Finally, we need 
  to demand that Congress pass legislation outlawing and invalidating the pernicious 
  practice of secret Executive Orders by the President, with no accountability 
  to the American people, such as Truman's classified Executive Order of 09/24/47 
  setting up MJ-12 and hiding extraterrestrial contact from the American people 
  (T. Good, Above Top Secret). The ball is in our court. </font>
