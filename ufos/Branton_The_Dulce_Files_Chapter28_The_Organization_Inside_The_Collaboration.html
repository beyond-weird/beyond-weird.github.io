"THE ORGANIZATION" -- INSIDE THE COLLABORATION





The following information comes from an article written by researcher
William Hamilton, titled MAGICAL CAVERNS, which was in turn based upon
Hamilton's book ALIEN MAGIC:



...The first case of subterranean abduction that I investigated occurred in
1988. I never reached a firm conclusion regarding the information that
resulted from this investigation, but did recieve corroborating reports
from other abductees. The incident occurred in the Rosamond area of the
Antelope Valley in California up on the sides of the Tehachapi Mountains.
The Tehachapi mountains rise on the north side of the valley. There is a
saddle in the mountains and a secret Northrop electromagnetic testing
facility is in the area just below the saddle. The Northrop facility has
been dubbed the "Ant-hill" or the "Black Hole" by some of the locals who
refer to it as a multileveled underground facility.

Ray and Nancy worked at the Northrop B-2 assembly factory in Palmdale. Ray
is a Native American. Ray was an aircraft inspector and worked swing shift.
One June night he decided to take a midnight ride with Nancy up to the cut
in the Tahachapi mountains. This cut appears as an inclined whitish mark on
the side of the foothills. It actually marks the site of a road that winds
up around the mountains. On the backside is an entrance to an artificial
plateau that had been blasted out of the rocks. Ray parked his truck on
this plateau. They got out to look at the stars and the city lights of
Lancaster and Palmdale in the valley far below. While looking at the stars,
Nancy noticed that some of them were moving around and brought it to Ray's
attention. Ray got his flashlight out of the truck and started signaling
the lights. At some point, Nancy noticed a bright basketball-sized orb
hovering just above a nearby knoll. They both walked closer to get a better
look at the orb. Ray thought it had just risen out of some invisible
opening in the ground. It seemed to be flashing and sparkling. Some sort of
line dangled from its underside. It rose a little higher and Nancy tried to
speak to it, having an intuitive feeling that some intelligence has guided
the orb to that plateau for their benefit. As they watched this strange
phenomenon around one o'clock in the morning, they next observed the
morning dawn light over the far distant eastern hills. Something had just
snatched four hours of time out of their lives. The orb was gone. They were
terrified and drove quickly home. The next day, they felt a vibration going
through their apartment. When they went outdoors, they saw two orbs
hovering above their apartment. This scared them badly.

I took Ray and Nancy to a local hypnotist and she regressed Ray. Nancy
refused to be regressed, expressing fear over what she might discover about
those four hours of missing time. Ray was an excellent subject. When in
trance, with little prompting, he fell backwards nearly to the floor before
we caught him. The regression brought out some amazing revelations. Ray and
Nancy had been abducted and taken underground!

Under hypnosis he kept mentioning the Kern River to the north. "There is an
area near the Tehachapi Mountains called the Kern River Project. The upper
river is being used by the government for hydro-electric power to power an
underground facility at Tehachapi Ranch [actually, the Tejon Ranch]. The
mountain next to the power facility is being hollowed out...there is mud
all around and it's so obvious, but apparently people aren't looking. All
the power is being used for the Ranch, which is the site of underground
'skunk works' where highly technical aircraft, spacecraft and all kinds of
stuff are being dealt with. It is a huge underground base, probably close
to the size of the one under 29 Palms Marine Base. It has huge hangers and
very large elevators as well as technical laboratories. There is a whole
city under there, large passageways...the whole valley is full of tunnels.
You can drive from one end to the other underground. You can drive from
Palmdale, site of the Northrop, Lockheed and 'black project' areas, to
California City...all underground. There are tunnels all the way to George
AFB. Aliens apparently have ACCESS...they've been seen all over the place.
The [corporate] government LETS them do whatever they want. They're probing
the human brain, trying to find our WEAKNESSES and learning how to CONTROL
us (like they've apparently 'learned' to 'control' the secret [corporate]
government elite who in turn control these underground military-industrial
networks and who have in essence turned these facilities over to the
aliens, whether out of fear of retaliation, out of some type of global
control agreement, or just plain mind control? - Branton). They dissect
humans...can't describe the dissections because they are not humane. Really
morbid. The 'government' knows it...they just turn their heads. Some people
in the government want to STOP this but they don't know HOW to stop it."

(Note: As so many "in the know" have already said, the entire
"alien-interaction" scenario is completely "out of control", which I would
guess means that WE are NO LONGER in control of the situation. In other
words the "framework" which was created as a result of the
alien-interaction projects when most of the human collaborators believed
that the "aliens" were benevolent, is STILL in place, even after "we" lost
control of the situation. Since the aliens now have CONTROL of much of the
INFRASTRUCTURE that grew out of the early interaction projects, the
control-structure or "establishment" itself WILL NOT and CAN NOT do
anything about the situation. It is up to those on earth who are NOT bound
by security RESTRICTIONS, or fraternal secret society OATHS, or in the case
of humanoid "visitors" those who are not bound by non-interferance
DIRECTIVES -- such as the many Nordic-Terran HYBRIDS who have according to
Michael Wolf and others been LEGALLY born into this society. In otherwords
it is those AND ONLY THOSE who are FREE from and operating OUTSIDE OF 'THE
SYSTEM' who have the power to change the situation for the better. -
Branton)

Ray was disconcerted that Greys had Nancy strapped to a table in this
facility. He could see instruments all around. During hypnosis he would
freeze up when recalling this scene. He yelled and became very emotional.
He was convinced they would rape her and violate her, yet he was helpless
to prevent it. He and Nancy also felt they had contact with a benevolent
race of aliens who had observed their capture [by the Greys]. After a few
months, Ray and Nancy announced to me that they wanted little more to do
with reporting further events. They felt exposed and monitored and feared
retribution if they continued talking. They last told me they intended to
go to Bible classes to find refuge from this enormous EVIL that encroached
upon their lives.

Many witnesses have observed unusual phenomenon over the Tejon Ranch. One
night on March 3, 1991 Pearl Schultz and Aric Leavitt sighted five or six
UFOs moving in pairs at various speeds and sometimes switching directions
over the Tehachapi Mountains. Each had a pulsating light that alternated
from bright white to heavy red. Mrs. Schultz noticed orange and yellow
colors. Some of the UFOs seemed to come from the saddle area.

A man named Stan saw a bright flash of orange light which seemed to have a
cigar-shape. He saw this from Avenue I looking northwest over the
Tehachapi's.

Three witnesses went up to the plateau near the Anthill on January 31,
1991. They saw a green-glowing disk take-off from this facility without any
apparent acceleration and climb at a 45 degree angle to the south. They
also heard a tone when they sighted the object. When traveling back down
the road [170th Street West], they saw two black vans and two black
helicopters.

In the morning dawn, a pilot was flying out of Fox Field on Avenue G headed
for Merced. His flight path would take him over the Tehachapi's. When
passing over the saddle where the Anthill is located on February 23, 1991,
he observed four white rectangular objects hovering over the facility. He
described them as being four times the size of a typical highway billboard.
They were each separated by about 200 yards. Another observer, who was
called on the phone, drove his car out to the highway and observed these
same objects before they winked out! (cloaked? - Branton)

One local man who has property on 170th Street West reported seeing the
ground open up like a missile silo within the fenced parameter surrounding
the Northrop installation. He saw a flying saucer emerge from this 'silo'
and take off. He also claimed that someone from Edwards had come to talk to
him about his story and told him to shut up. I further found out that the
man's name is Chuck and he was a contractor who worked on the underground
tunnels in the Anthill facility. He said the tunnels have round doorways
with panels that have red and green lights for ID and entry. There are no
doors covering these doorways, but some kind of field is projected from
cylinders embedded in the door wall. Tiny globes hovered in the tunnels and
followed Chuck and his crew around. He thought they were being used by the
Air Force as sensors. But where did the Air Force get the technology to
levitate these orbs?

Joe told me a lot of stories. He attended many of my UFOrum meetings in
Lancaster. He claims to have had a close encounter and missing time when
traveling a road through the south side of Edwards AFB one night. Joe was
in construction and held clearances for working in military operation
areas. He said that he had worked on an underground tunnel project below
Haystack Butte on the Eastern boundary of Edwards near the NASA Rocket Test
Site. He also claimed that he saw orbs roving around these tunnels. He
painted numbers inside a box located on a stripe that ran horizontally
midway along the tunnel walls. I asked him how far this tunnel ran below
the earth's surface. He said that he and fellow employees used to count as
the elevator descended to the tunnel level. From the count and from the
elevator speed, I estimated that the tunnel must have been around 3,000
feet deep.

One time he saw a door open to a room in one of these tunnels and he could
see a very tall alien standing next to two men in white lab coats. He
thought this alien was all of nine feet tall. He claims that he saw two
grey aliens inside a hangar at China Lake one day when he went back inside
the hanger after finishing his work to retrieve a tool that he had left
behind. Joe was always telling me fantastic stories, yet he seemed very
sincere. I never knew whether to believe him.

One day Joe told me about two old school buddies he had run across. They
both held jobs in underground facilities and had worked at the Anthill, he
said. They would work underground for two weeks at a stint. They lived in
condos when working underground. These condos were also built into the
underground facility. The government even picked up the tab on one guy's
alimony. One was known as a computer genius. He said that he had seen both
grey AND reptilian life forms in various underground facilities. One of the
underground projects was Project Startalk. The work involved lasers. The
informer, a guy named Paul, said that he worked in a big underground
building [350 feet across]. Project Startalk utilized a powerful laser
which strikes a mirror and is sent into space. The laser is modulated with
a signal and acts as a beacon to bring in UFOs. Apparently, the beacon is
directed at friendly forces from other systems. He also worked at the
Douglas facility near Llano. He once saw a saucer land and go into an
underground hanger. Inside the underground building is a huge computer
complex. The workers wear white clothing and white socks [no shoes]. The
computers use an alien symbolic language. Manuals indicate codes that can
be entered. There is a large lexon plastic screen in this complex that
displays various star systems and galaxies. A wax pencil is used to
indicate targets for the laser. The technology used is so far advanced that
it is beyond known engineering technology. The laser is also capable of
INTERDIMENSIONAL communication. (Hyperspace or subspace communication? It
would HAVE to be so, since laser-light modulated in third dimensional beams
would take at least 3 years to reach the nearest star. - Branton) Security
workers accompany all workers, even to the bathroom. Phones are tapped,
even worker's home phones. It took Paul and Gopher [the second guy] two
years to get a security clearance. (Note: If the Military-Industrial
establishment or the 'corporate' government is involved with the alien
interaction as it would seem to be, then the electorate government does not
have entire control of the situation... those who control these corporate
structures do! Or those whose motivation is to increase their wealth and
power even if it means making "business deals" with malevolent alien
forces. Their motivation would NOT necessarily be to govern the American
citizen's nor uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States! As
they say, the lust for money is the root of ALL evil. - Branton)

Gopher also worked at the Anthill as a computer specialist. He has also
worked at Lockheed's Helendale facility and at the Nevada Test Site. Gopher
says that we are working with aliens and alien technology and it scares the
hell out of him. He gets paid well. He makes $145 thousand a year and the
'government' pays his alimony. He says he has also worked at SECTION D,
better known as the DULCE facility. He has seen reptoids and Greys in these
underground facilities. He doesn't have a life of his own. He worked with
white-skinned reptoids (probably the "white draco" that Thomas Castello
spoke of - Branton). He has also seem members of the Orange race. HE HAS
NOT SEEN ANY BENEFIT TO HUMANITY. He is trying to find out what is going to
happen. He is worried about what the future holds. He foresees an ALIEN
WAR. He has a good lifestyle underground. Besides the condo, he has
swimming pools, saunas, and a gym at his disposal. He works 14 to 16 days
on a shift. He is not allowed to leave the country and must obtain
permission to leave the state. He says the main control center in the
valley is at Haystack Butte. A tunnel runs from Haystack Butte to the
Anthill. Gopher believes there are benevolent aliens and says he saw one
once. They are from a Federation. The one he saw was human looking, a tall
blond [Nordic] that wore a white jump suit and had a green coat over it. He
believes that we are trying to enlist the aid of such friendly beings. This
is a very similar scenario to what I recieved in the letter from a veteran.

My friend's stepson obtained a job in an underground facility at Los
Alamos. He says there is a tube shuttle that runs from that underground
facility to SECTION D. He worked on Level I which RUNS UNDER MAIN STREET
[in Dulce]. One block from the PAN AM building is the old high school, now
used as an engineering facility by HAKEN HANGAR [Originally ZIA Corp].
INSIDE THE FACILITY IS AN ELEVATOR THAT DESCENDS TO THE COMPUTER ROOM. From
the computer room a side tunnel intersects the main tunnel transit tube
that runs from Los Alamos to Albuquerque. These levels are protected by
PROFORCE Security. At deeper, more secure levels exist automatic devices
that kill intruders. A security guard accidentally tripped an alarm and was
killed by one of these. These tunnels are a minor part of a VAST network of
such tunnels. One other thing mentioned by this source is an underground
city which housed a population of thousands who occupied CONDOS. Many of
these people lived permanently underground. Some of the advanced
technological research going on involves genetic labs using laser fusion.
The budget for the SURFACE facility [alone] is OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A
YEAR, but the underground research projects get MANY TIMES THIS AMOUNT (How
much of this comes from our hard-earned tax dollars? Is the America economy
and our wealth literally "going down the tubes"? - Branton)

Pam and I were introduced to an abductee named Diane a few years ago. Diane
lives over in the Apple Valley area. She had ongoing alien encounters since
she was a child. As she grew older, she started experiencing abductions by
humans that took her to underground facilities. One of these underground
facilities she believed was located at China Lake Naval Weapons test center
(just west of the Panamint Range and Death Valley - Branton). She was taken
down to lower levels in an elevator. Her description of this elevator
matched the description given by a man named Thomas of an elevator in use
at the Dulce facility. Thomas' description of this and other details were
never published [at the time] so that we could check out corroborating
eyewitness reports. Evidently these elevators have an unusual shape and
operate on magnetic forces in the elevator shaft rather than using cable
systems to run the elevator up and down the shaft. Diane also reports that
she was taken on a tour of one part of the facility by a man in a white
coat. He showed her humans that had been biologically altered. These humans
were housed in cages set about a foot above the floor. She also saw altered
animals. Her story was just as bizarre as Thomas' story of Level 7 at
Dulce.

The story of an underground base on the Jicarilla Apache Indian reservation
first came to light around 1980 when Albuquerque physicist Paul Bennewitz
reported the crash of an alien ship on the slopes of Archuleta Mountain.
Paul wrote a letter to Senator Pete Domenici and Paul Gilman in Washington
D.C. This letter was accompanied by a report. He said, "Atomic ship
originally outlined in my report...copy to you...several years ago had
crashed approximately two miles northwest of Dulce, NM near Archuleta Peak
on Archuleta Mesa". He believed there was a concern because gamma and
neutron radiation could be emitted from the crash site if there had been a
nuclear meltdown. Paul's THUNDER SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION manufactured
various detection instruments.

In his PROJECT BETA report, Bennewitz stated that humanoid aliens had a
base near Archuleta Mesa and that he had established direct computer
communication with aliens at the base. He did not believe the aliens to be
trustworthy. Paul became paranoid about the government, the aliens, and
admitted abductees whom he believed were being controlled by the aliens. At
a MUFON conference held in Las Vegas in 1989, featured speaker Bill Moore
made the statement that Paul Bennewitz was fed disinformation by
intelligence agents, that he contributed to this effort, and the WHOLE
STORY concerning the Dulce facility was constructed around these bits of
disinformation that were fed to Paul (or was it a case of "reverse
disinformation" in the same vein as "reverse psychology"? - Branton).
However, testimony from Walter Baumgartner and state police officer Gabe
Valdez indicates otherwise. According to them, they had SEEN video images
of aliens that Paul had made contact with using his special equipment (that
is, a video-radio link utilizing a hexadecimal code with computer printout
which he used to 'interrogated' the alien's collective intelligence via
ship-to-base communication frequencies - Branton). These aliens would send
messages that would output on Paul's computer printer. Some of the sentence
structure was disjointed. Were intelligence agents taking extreme measure
by hoaxing computer communications with Paul? For what purpose? Apparently
Bennewitz was using special transmitter coils to send and recieve
electromagnetic signals to and from the alien base.

Then along came Thomas. Thomas E. Castello was born in Glen Ellan, Illinois
on April 23, 1941. Thomas was the man who released the Dulce papers. His
good friend, Ann West (pseudonym - true name on file.- Branton), tells his
story -- as Thomas has not been heard from since 1991.

Thomas had a passion for antique cars, any antique car, but especially
Packards, and especially the big-nosed cars of the forties and early
fifties. A lot of his spare time was spent modifying his 1949 Packard, and
he needed special parts. His friends told him about an older man in town
that had a machine shop that could rebuild antique cars. This old man was
Ed West, Ann's father. He found Ed easy to talk to, not just about cars,
but anything. The two spent endless hours discussing cars, planes, and the
space program. Tom and Ed found they were both fascinated with flying
saucers.

After a few months, Ed introduced Tom to "THE ORGANIZATION", a group that
did deep research on flying saucers and contactees. Tom completed
INITIATION into the group and was soon on several assignments.

At that time in 1961, Tom was in the Air Force, stationed at Nellis AFB
[near] Las Vegas. He was schooled in photography, and had recieved a top
secret clearance. He was given the opportunity of receiving additional
training in Virginia. There, he had his first experience of working in an
underground base. When he left that facility, his top secret clearance was
upgraded to TS-IV.

His duties as an Air Force sergeant included photographing a runway
exercise in Florida. He would meet with Ann during his off-duty time in
Orlando. Tom was pleased to discover that Ann drove a classic 1950 Packard
straight-eight with a beautiful swan as a hood ornament.

The next year, 1963, Ann moved to Las Vegas to be near her folks.

When she was in Florida, she had a close encounter with a glowing flying
saucer and was actually taken on board. The haunting dreams and memories of
this incident bothered Ann. Tom introduced HER to "The Organization". After
a few visits, Ann became initiated into the group and started certain
assignments. She and Tom began to collect books, articles, and magazines
about UFOs. They would spend nights doing research.

Over the years, Tom became like a brother to Ann. His parents were killed
in a car accident so he adopted Ann's parents into his heart.

Tom stayed in high security photography for seven years, then left the Air
Force in 1971. He began working for RAND Corp. in California as a security
technician. Within a year, his clearance was upgraded to ULTRA-3.

Tom met Cathy in 1972 and got married. In November, 1974, Cathy gave birth
to Eric Scott Castello. They moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1977. Tom had
been transferred and his clearance upgraded to ULTRA-7. He found his new
position financially rewarding, but more stressful. He told Ann that he
worked in an underground facility that had incredible security, for the
photography department. His job touched on all aspects of photography from
large format cameras to mini cameras. It was his responsibility to check,
align, and calibrate all the security video cameras, from the doors to exit
tunnels. His position required that he be armed at all times. It was also
his job to escort visitors to certain areas of the base. This facility came
to be known as the Dulce Base. When Tom finally left his job, he had earned
the security rank of Major.

Tom and Cathy, and TAL and Mary LeVesque, all lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico
in 1979 when Ann went to visit them. Tom seemed more intense than usual. He
said that he wished that he could talk to Ann about his concerns, but his
high security clearance prevented him from saying much. The day Ann left
New Mexico, Tom pressed a folded piece of paper into her hand and whispered
quietly, "don't let anyone see this." She slipped it into her pocket. That
night, alone at a motel in Durango, she opened the paper. There were three
things on its yellow page: a sketch of an alien; an inverted triangle; and
the name Dulce. She stared at the mysterious drawing and tried to figure
out what it all meant. The alien in the drawing had a large head, big black
eyes, no nose and no hair. The triangle was shaded black. After looking at
it, she flushed the paper down the toilet. That night, she had nightmares
about aliens.

The next morning, over coffee, she was looking at a map for a route back to
Las Vegas when she noticed the name of a small town near the New Mexico
state line called 'Dulce.' Were there aliens in Dulce? What was Tom trying
to tell her? Then she remembered where she had seen the black triangle
before. The symbol was on a hat on Tom's coffee table. It was burnt orange
with a black inverted triangle with gold bands cutting it in three
sections.

(Note: It is interesting that this three-level triangle is inverted, when
we consider that some 'Nordic' groups use an UPRIGHT triangle with three
horizontal lines through it as their emblem. Some 'Christian' sources have
reported 'visions' of the 'New Jerusalem' city mentioned in the book of
Revelation, as being a vast city of LIGHT and of pyramidal shape and in
three levels. This 'city of light' has been reportedly observed -- using
super-powerful telescopes -- to be emerging from the 'nebula' far beyond
the Orion cluster, and it is said to be on a direct course to earth. This
is reportedly the supreme headquarters of the angelic forces and the Triune
Godhead under whom they serve, according to these Christian sources. This
description would coincide with the Nordic emblem of an upright three-level
triangle or pyramid, in that these humanoids would no doubt be aware of
this Divine center of angelic activity IF our elite scientists are, and the
fact that an INVERTED or upside-down three-level triangle is associated
with the Dulce base might denote a direct Luciferian connection. This is
especially interesting if the reports are true which state that the Dulce
base has its counterparts within the 4th and 5th densities or dimensions of
that particular point in time-space. - Branton)

She decided to drive through Dulce looking for something suspicious, but
found nothing. She went back to Durango and drove to Cortez. She fell in
love with it, and moved to Colorado.

Early in December of that year, Tom paid Ann a surprise visit. He told her
that he had walked out on his job some months ago after a major dispute
broke out between security workers and a military group. Tom said that the
security force used "flash guns," but the military group was armed with
machine guns (although an apparent human/alien security force may have
possessed flash guns and the military force machine guns -- this does not
necessarily mean that a weapons dispute was the SOLE 'trigger' of the
conflict - Branton). He said it was like a war with screaming and panic in
all the tunnels. A lot of people died in the conflict. He wondered what
story the government would use to cover-up the deaths. In February, 1980,
the media reported a prison riot near Los Alamos and that many prisoners
died. Was this the cover-up?

Tom admitted that he was in trouble. He went back to the base and took
photos, papers, and other items. He had entered and left through a
ventilation shaft inside an ICE CAVE. After leaving the cave, he returned
to a prepared box, put everything in the box, and buried it. He went back
to his car, but security was waiting for him. They questioned him about his
purpose for being there, but allowed him to leave. He was on his way to
Colorado Springs, and now he was "on the run." He asked Ann to have faith
in him and that he was still the same man she had always known as a friend.

The next day, after he had left, three men from O.S.I. showed up and
questioned Ann about Tom's where-abouts. On four other visits in December
other men questioned her and she told them she knew nothing about where he
had gone. In January, the CIA came to her door. They insisted that she was
withholding information.

Ann had been in a car accident in 1978 and had recurring headaches. In
January, 1980 she checked into a hospital in Farmington, New Mexico. She
went in for an angiogram, but woke up to find that she had had a stroke.
She had to re-learn everything again. At that time the OSI and CIA stopped
bothering her.

It was June of 1982 before she heard from Thomas again. He called from her
dad's house. They talked for hours. He had been running for his life and
had been in twenty states and four countries. He showed her medical papers
and scientific diagrams, but Ann could not make sense of it all. Tom told
her that the 'government' had a treaty with an alien nation and that aliens
had been on [under] this earth for countless centuries. He showed Ann pages
of alien written material and translated papers. It was horrifying. He told
her that Cathy and Eric had been KIDNAPPED and were being' held CAPTIVE in
a subterranean base. He needed a safe place to hide all the original papers
that he took from the Dulce Base and other things of a substantial nature
to prove the alien conspiracy. Tom and Ann buried the box of material on a
mountain. Years have changed the terrain, and Ann has not been able to
relocate the exact burial site.

Sound like a tall tale? Many think it is. Ann had photos of Thomas and
details of his life in her files. TAL met with him once. He is a real
person. He answered some of my questions by mail. He fully believes what he
says and has answered the questions when he knows the answers. Some of this
information has been published in hopes of eliciting further witness
testimony. So far, I only know of three others who claim they have been to
this underground facility. One man is known to a friend of mine and was
trained as a nuclear physicist.

The Dulce Facility is a seven-level underground research base, run by the
D.O.E. [Dept. Of Energy] (As is the Nevada Test Site - Branton) and
connected to the Los Alamos labs. Level I has garages, street maintenance
equipment, photo labs, hydroponic gardens to grow fresh vegetables, fruits,
legumes, etc., human housing, a mess hall, VIP housing, a kitchen, and a
security vehicles garage. Each of the levels has color-coded electric cars
that are used for short-distance transport. Level 6 houses the infamous
"Nightmare Hall"; a security arsenal; a military arsenal; military
security; and a generator/impulsor. The generator is 200 feet in diameter,
and has a two-level Electromagnetic impulse device that can create a
perfect clone [duplicate or replicate] of a person.

Science-Fiction? Abductees have described being taken to similar
facilities.

There is no proof unless someone can find the box. If it is there! (or
unless one succeeds in discovering one of the entrances to the base,
although there would no doubt be risks if one were to attempt entrance to
the base without full-scale military backup. - Branton).

However, these stories have prompted researchers, including myself, to find
