THE DULCE NETWORK -- NORTH SECTOR?





The following account was recieved by Bill Cooper from a 'friend', and
appeared under the title "Robert's Story". Compare this report with other
accounts concerning Dulce-base extensions in northeast Arizona, southeast
Utah and southwest Colorado [Four Corners Area] where "dissident
scientists" are reportedly being held captive:



Robert _____ ______, a young man in his early 20's came to work at my shop
as a temporary help during the 2nd week of October 1986. The first day at
work, he approached me asking about my interest in the UFO phenomenon. Then
he smiled, paused, and waited for my reaction. I told him that I was
interested, particularly in the crash/recovery of saucers and bodies of
occupants. That I was secondly interested in the rumors pertaining to an
'alien' and intelligence group alliance set up years ago.

He then told me he would reveal something to me pertaining to my second
interest as mentioned above. He told me the following [condensed by me]:

He was in the military headquartered with the 4th Engineering Group at Fort
Carson, Colorado. Just got out 2 months prior to the date of telling me
this.

He showed me a military I.D. card from Fort Carson and another with a
strange checker board design on it. He said he had a Super Top Secret
clearance and worked as a laboratory assistant in southwestern Colorado
associated with the Delta Group out of Fort Carson.

He witnessed cryogenic experimentation going on with human beings. This
experimentation was conducted by both 'aliens' and some Super Secret
intelligence group.

Some high ranking military and scientific personnel were taken down to
cryogenic temperatures through a process of draining their blood and
pumping a chemical mixture into the circulatory system to prevent cell
destruction during the freezing and thawing periods.

The 'aliens' were the only ones who knew the mixture formula and the
gradual thawing process. They at first refused to give the formula and
process to the scientific team, and threatened to leave the above mentioned
personnel in that cryogenic state forever unless the scientists cooperated
on some certain issues.

He also told me about some 'alien' technics concerning time travel,
Dimensional travel, related to unified field physics.

After revealing these seemingly fantastic things to me over a 3 week period
of time he quit the temporary job here. I finally found out that his father
Robert _________ Sr. [Robert used to be Robert _________ Jr. before his
father and mother divorced and he took the name of his mothers second
husband, ______.] worked with me in the metal finishing department. The
following was told to me by Robert _________ Sr. on Dec 16, 1986:

On the evening of Wednesday, Dec. 3, 1986, my son Robert ______ called me
via the telephone [he hadn't been home for over a week]. He sounded as if
he were scared to death. He said, "I have to go back to Colorado
immediately". I asked why. He said, "The bounty hunters found me and told
me that I had to go back with them to the base in Colorado because I know
to much." I asked if there were any way he could beat them and get out of
it? Robert stated, "They said there is no way out. In fact the chief bounty
hunter confronted me face to face."

Evidently Robert Jr. tried to beat the bounty hunters. His alleged body was
found in room #5 of the Walls Motel in Long Beach, California, with a gun
in his hand and a bullet hole through his head. Drugs were found in the
room, but not in his body [he was not the drug type].

The Long Beach Police Dept. investigated the case which ended very abruptly
with no explanation. When I asked them why the case was closed so quickly,
they snapped back, "Its none of your business". The final autopsy report
stated that the death was a drug related suicide.

I was not allowed to see the body for one solid week. I would call the
police, they would say the body was at the funeral parlor. The funeral
parlor would say we don't have the body. This went on back and forth for
that one solid week [Dec. 5th - Dec. 12th, 1986]. When I was finally
allowed to view the body, I immediately could tell it was not him!! This
body, alleged to be Robert ______, was about 20 Lbs heavier and about 3 to
4 inches shorter than my son. That was not Robert even tho the basic facial
feature's were his.

One very significant thing that Robert stated to me before his alleged
death was, "Dad, they are coming to take me away. I will give you a code
name ______________ [only Robert and his father know that code name]. If
you receive a letter, telephone call, or by messenger, sometime in the
future [with] this code name, you will know that I am alive. They need me
for my special DNA, that is why I have to go back."

Robert has special Occult Powers and has an interest in witch craft. He
says all of this UFO stuff is directly related to witch craft and the
occult. In February - April 1987 both Robert _________ Sr. and myself were
under surveillance by what we considered an agent from the cover-up group.
He went by the name of John Chunn. We finally confronted him face to face
concerning all of this. Needless to say he quit work that day and never
came back. Robert Sr. has been harassed several times by an individual who
wanted Robert Sr. to go to the 4 corners area with him. On April 16, 1987,
he said he would reunite him with his son. _________ backed out the last
minute.

Later Robert Sr. was picked up by the police for no reason at all and held
for one week. When he got back home he found out that his place had been
ransacked.

On Nov. 9, 1987, a person riding a motorcycle and dressed like a biker
approached _________, identifying himself as Lt. Leed or Reade and claimed
that he had a Top Secret clearance and had access to the files pertaining
to the projects that his son was still involved in. He said that he would
place _________ in touch with Robert ______ and said he was working in an
underground base. He said you cannot find this base on any maps or in any
military directories.

Robert ______ was in the following unit. -- HHC 4th STU BU., ABN., FBG
31905v Fort Carson, Colorado.
