Dear Steven:

It was nice talking to you last night. I have enclosed the Dulce papers
for your information. Also enclosed is a transcript of the McCampbell
conversation with Paul Bennewitz and project Beta. Also the Gary Stollman
statement. What follows is my current hypothesis formed after my 2 week
trip through Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona talking to various 
individuals, some Air Force, some Sandia and some others.

 MJ-12 representing the U.S. Government made a deal with the EBE's (extra-
terrestrial biological entities) or "Greys" around the period of 1969-
1970-1971. The "deal" was in exchange for technology that they would 
provide to us we would ignore the abductions that were going on. The EBE's
assured us that these abductions were merely ongoing monitoring of develop-
ing civilizations:  (in fact these abductions have been for at least 3
purposes: (1) insertion of a tiny probe about 3 millimeters in size into 
the brain for monitoring and programming purposes; (2) post hypnotic sugges-
tion concerning an important event that will occur in the next 2 to 5 years
and giving the subject someplace to go and something to perform at that
time; under our best hypnotic techniques we were unable to find out when
or where or what this event is, and (3) genetic crossbreeding between the
EBE's and humans. In many of the abductee hypnotic regressions of women
with unusual terminated pregnancies they have been shown these "cross-
breeds", usually frail tiny beings with comparatively large heads, thin
skin, very thin arms and legs. Since we weren't aware of these facts we
went along with the agreement but insisted on a list of the abductees to be
submitted periodically to the National Security Council and MJ-12.
 
The EBE's have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system is atro-
phied and not functional. Some speculate that they were involved in some
type of nuclear war or possibly on the back side of a genetic curve. In
order to sustain themselves they use an enzyme or hormonal secretion
obtained from the tongues and throats of cows or humans. (Note:  cows and
humans are genetically similar. In event of a national disaster cow blood
can be used by humans). This secretion is mixed with H2O2 (hydrogen perox-
ide) and another substance and is either spread on the skin, or the hands
are dipped in the solution. The body then absorbs the mixture and excretes     
the waste back through the skin.

The cattle mutilations that were prevalent throughout the period from 
1973 to 1983 and publicly noted through newspaper and magazine stories and
included a documentary produced by Linda Howe for the Denver CBS affiliate
were for the collection of these secretions and other items. The mutilations
included genitals taken, rectums cored out to the colon, eyes missing and
the tongue and throat cut with extreme surgical precision. The incisions
were made cutting between the cells, actually separating molecular 
structure. This is why no blood was found at all, yet there was no
vascular collapse. This has also been true in human mutilations,
one of the first ones of which was Sgt. Jonathan P. Louette at the
White Sands Missile Test Range in 1956, who was found three days after an
Air Force Major had witnessed the abduction of Sgt. Louette by a "disk
shaped" object about 0200 one morning. His genitals had been removed, 
rectum cored out in a surgically precise "plug" up to the colon, eyes re-
moved and no blood remaining, with no vascular collapse. From some of the
evidence it is apparent that this surgery is accomplished in most cases
while the victim, animal or human, is still alive. The various parts are
taken to various underground laboratories, one of which is known to be
2-1/2 miles northwest of the small New Mexico town of Dulce, 1 Km deep
inside the Archuletta Mesa. This jointly occupied (CIA-Alien) facility
has been described as enormous, with huge tiled halls that "go on for-
ever". Several ink drawings of photos taken inside the facility were
recently released as the "Dulce Papers". The photos show large vats with
pale meat being agitated in solution. An abductee in regression recalled
"large test tubes with humans in them. I saw a baby in another".

After the initial agreement between MJ-12 and the aliens, Groom Lake,
one of this nation's most secret test centers in Nevada was closed for a
period of 2 years (1972-1973) and a huge underground facility was con-
structed for and with the help of the EBE's. The bargained-for techno-
logy was set in place but could only be operated by the EBE's them-
selves. Needless to say, the advanced technology could not be used against
the EBE's in case of need.

During the period of 1979 through 1983 it became increasingly obvious to
MJ-12 that things were not going as planned. It became known that many
more people (in the thousands) were being abducted than were listed on
the official abduction list being supplied to the National Security Coun-
cil and MJ-12 and that the abductions included much more that the "simple
monitoring of an advancing civilization". In addition, it became obvious
that some, not all, but some of the nation's missing children had been 
used for secretions and other parts required by the aliens.

In 1979, there was an altercation of sorts at the Archuletta laboratory.
Delta Force was called in to try and free a number of people trapped in
the facility who had become aware of what was really going on. 66 of the
soldiers were killed in the effort and our people were not freed.

By 1984, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror of the mistake they had made
in dealing with the EBE's. They had subtly promoted "Close Encounters of
the Third Kind" and "E.T." to get the public used to "odd-looking" aliens
that were compassionate, benevolent, and very much our "space brothers".
They "sold" the EBE's to the public and were now faced with the fact that
quite the opposite was true. In addition, a plan started in 1968-1969
to make the public aware of the existance of aliens on Earth over the
next 20 years, to be culminated with several documentaries to be released
during the 1985-1987 period of time. These documentaries would explain the
history and intentions of the EBE's. The discovery of the "Grand Deception"
put the entire plans, hopes, wishes, and dreams of MJ-12 into complete
confusion and panic.

Meeting at the "Country Club", a remote lodge with private golf course and
lavish sleeping and working quarters built by and exclusively for the
members of MJ-12, it was a factional fight of what to do now. Part of 
MJ-12 wanted to confess the whole scheme and shambles it had become to the
public, beg their forgiveness, and ask for their support. The other half
of MJ-12 argued there was no way they could do that, that the situation
was untenable and there was no use in exciting the public with the "hor-
rible truth" and the best plan was to continue the development of a weapon
that could be used against the EBE's under the guise of "SDI", the Strate-
gic Defense Initiative, which had nothing whatever to do with a defense
from Russian nuclear missiles. As these words are being written, Dr. Teller
"father of the H-bomb", is in the test tunnels of the Nevada Test Site
driving his workers and associates in the words of one, "like a man
possessed". And well he should for Dr. Teller was a member of MJ-12, along
with Dr. Kissinger, Bobby Inman and possibly Admiral Poindexter, to name
a few of the current MJ-12.

Before the "Grand Deception" was discovered and according to the meticulous
plan of metered release of information to the public, several documentaries
and videotapes were made. William Moore, a Burbank, California-based UFO
researcher came into possession of a videotape through his contacts with
MJ-12 who had taken a great interest in Mr. Moore's book, "The Roswell
Incident", published in 1980. The book detailed the crash, recovery, and
subsequent coverup of a UFO with 4 alien bodies. They decided to use
Moore as one of several conduits to help in the gradual release of the
existance of aliens to the public. The video Mr. Moore had was an inter-
view by 2 well known newsmen of a military officer associated with MJ-12.
In the interview the military officer answers questions relating to the
history of MJ-12 and the coverup, the recovery of a number of flying
saucers, the existance of a live alien (one of three living aliens, desig-
nated or named EBE1, EBE2, and EBE3) being held in a facility designated
as YY-II at Los Alamos, New Mexico. The only other facility of this type
is at Edwards Air Force Base in Mojave, California. The officer named
names as previously mentioned plus a few others:  Harold Brown, Richard
Helms, Gen. Vernon Walters, and Von Karmon. The officer also relates the
fact that the EBE's claim to have created Christ. The EBE's have some sort
of recording device that has recorded all of the Earth's history and can
display it in the form of a hologram. This hologram can be filmed but
because of the way holograms work, it does not come out clearly. The
crucifixion of Christ on the Mount of Olives has allegedly been put on
film to show to the public. The EBE's claim to have created Christ in
view of the "Grand Deception" could be an effort to disrupt traditional
values for undetermined reasons.

Another videotape alleged to be in existence is an interview with an EBE.
Since EBE's communicate telepathically, an Air Force Colonel serves as an
interpreter. Just before the recent stock market crash, several newsmen
including Bill Moore had been invited to Los Alamos to personally film
and distribute to the public a similar type interview. Apparently, because
of the market crash, it was felt that the timing was not propitious.

Moore is also in possession of more Aquarius documents, the first few
pages of which leaked out several years ago and detailed a supersecret
NSA project which has been denied by them until just recently. The 
Aquarius Project was the communication with aliens, specifically the EBE's.
Within the Aquarius Project was Project Snowbird, a project to test fly
a recovered alien aircraft at Groom Lake, Nevada.

Moore feels that MJ-12 has been stringing him along, promising to go 
public with some of the information on the extraterrestrials for too long
a time. He has made the decision that if MJ-12 does not come forward with
the information and release it publicly by the end of 1987 then he, Moore,
will go with "what he's got", i.e. the videotapes, remainder of the
Aquarius documents, and additional matter.

Certain of Moore's statements leads one to believe that Moore himself is a
government agent working for MJ-12, not being strung along, but stringing
along ever hopeful ufologists that the truth is just around the corner.
Consider:

1.   Moore states emphatically that he is not a government agent, although
     when Les Graham (a Southern California-based ufologist) was investi-
     gated by the DIS for documents in his possession received from Moore,
     Moore himself was not.

2.   Moore states emphatically that the cattle mutilations were a hoax by
     Linda Howe to create publicity for herself. He cites the unobtainable
     book "Mute Evidence" as the bottom line on the hoax.

3.   Moore states that the U.S.A.F. Academy physics book "Introductory
     Space Science" Volumn II Chapter 13 titled Unidentified Flying Objects
     and describes four of the most commonly seen aliens (one of which was
     an EBE) was written by a Lt. Col. and Major who did not know what they
     were talking about and were merely citing "crackpots". He says the
     book was withdrawn to exise the chapter.

If the government felt they were being forced to acknowledge the  
existence of aliens on Earth because of overwhelming mounting evidence
and taking into consideration the "Grand Deception" and obvious hostile
intentions of the EBE's it might be expedient for MJ-12 to admit to EBE's 
but conceal information of the mutilations and abductions.
If MJ-12 and Moore were in some kind of agreement then it would be
benificial to toe the party line. For example "...here are some more
genuine documents but remember...don't discuss the mutilations or
abductions". If Moore was indeed working as an agent for MJ-12 he would
follow the party line anyway...pooh poohing the mutilations and abductions.

Time will tell. It is possible that Moore will go ahead and release the 
video interview with the military officer around the first of the new year.
From MJ-12's point of view the public would be exposed to the information
without really having to believe it because Moore is not as credible a
source as, say, the President of the United States. After a few months of
digestion and discussion a more credible source could emerge with a state-
ment that yes, in fact, the interview was essentially fact. This would
cushion somewhat the blow to the public.

If, however, Moore does not release the tape by, say, February 1, but comes
instead with a story similar to: "MJ-12 has informed me they are definitly
planning a total release of all information by October 1988. I have seen
the plan and have seen the guarantees that this will happen. So I have de-
cided to withhold the issuance of my videotape at this time as it may cause
problems", this would, in effect, buy more time for MJ-12, and time is what
they desperatly need.

The rest of us have to wonder what the big picture is anyway. Are the EBE's
having done a hundred thousand or more abductions and built an untold
number of underground bases (Groom Lake, Sunspot, Datil, Pietown,
Northern Nevada, Roswell, just to name a few alien underground bases)
getting ready to go back to where they came from? Or from the obvious
preparation are we to assume they are getting ready for some big move?
Or, the most sinister and most probable situation is that the invasion
is essentially complete and everything is over but the screaming.

A well-planned invasion of Earth for its resources and benefits would not
start with mass landings and a lot of rayguns. A properly planned and
executed invasion by a civilization thousands and probably hundreds
of thousands of years in advance of us would be complete before only a
handful, 12 for instance, would even know. No muss, no fuss.

Here is a list of some of the probable visitors to Earth from outer space.
The only known home of these visitors is that of the EBE's and which is
Zeta Reticuli 1 & 2, a binary star system visible from the Southern Hemi-
sphere approximatly 38 light years away with a spectral class of G2,
identical to our Sun.

Three Types of EBE's (Greys)

   Grey-1:      3-1/2 ft. tall, large head, large slanted eyes. Worship
                technology. Don't give a damn about mankind.

   Grey-2:      Same type, different finger arrangement, slightly differ-
                ent face. More sophistocated than Grey-1, use common sense,
                passive. May not need secretions.

   Grey-3:      Same basic type. Lips thinner, more subservient to other
                two greys.

Blonds, Swedes, Nordics

   Known by any of these monikers. Similar to Humans. Blond hair, blue
   eyes. Will not break universal law of "non-interference" to help us.
   They could only intervene if any Grey activity would have adverse 
   effect in another part of universe.

Interdimensional

   Entity that can assume various shapes. Peaceful nature.

Hairy Dwarfs

   4 ft. tall, 35 lbs. Extremely strong. Hairy, neutral. Don't try to
   hurt intelligent life.

Very Tall Race

   Look like humans but 7 or 8 ft. tall. Unit with Blonds.

Humans Appearing Similar to Blonds (seen with Greys)

   Drones created by Greys. Child-like mentality.

MIB's

   Men in black. Wear all black. Sunglasses. Very pale skin. Do not
   conform to normally accepted patterns. Extremely sensitive to light.
   May be a holographic image.

That's all I have for you now except to tell you that Moore has shown the
videotape to 5 well known persons to judge reactions. One of those persons 
was Paul Harvey, well known news commentator and personal friend. Paul says
he has seen the evidence but rejects the content. I talked with him briefly
over the telephone the other day to tell him that the video was essentially
true but there was some very important information that he should be aware
of known as the Grand Deception. I told him that one thing, the story that
the EBE's invented Christ, was probably not true. He said he didn't believe
that part anyway. I told him it was important that he know "the rest of the
story" and that I would be in Chicago in a few weeks to brief him. He said
that I was certainly welcome.

A word about channeling and channelors. Pure, unadulterated crap. The Greys
have created this "Space Brother" nonsense to appeal to a certain segment
of the population who might otherwise dig for real information.

Steve, I want to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and Happy New
Year and hope this letter finds everybody in good health.
