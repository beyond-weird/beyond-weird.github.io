SPEAKER : ...committee for coming out tonight.  For many years
there has been speculation that the US Government knows far more
about UFOs than it has told the public. In 1967 Robert Hastings
was personally involved in a UFO sighting at an Air Force missile
base which remains classified to this day. This incident prompted
Mr.Hastings to begin collecting evidence of an official
government coverup on UFOs. He is here this evening to report on
his research and the work of other UFO investigators. Please
welcome Mr. Hastings.

[clap clap]

HASTINGS: Thank you. In March, 1967.. I was present at the
[Maumstrom] Air Force base Montana air traffic control tower when
5 unidentified aerial targets, as they are called, suddenly began
to be tracked on multiple radar scopes. I was not in the Air
Force myself, rather, I was a 16 year old Air Force brat and
an acquaintance of several of the air traffic controllers.
     On the night in question it was immediately apparent to
these gentlemen that the objects they were tracking on radar were
neither conventional aircraft nor helicopters. For approximately
a 30 minute period these aerial objects were observed on radar at
times to hover, at other times they performed high speed aerial
maneuvers. At one point during the radar tracking, two jets were
launched from [Maumstrom] Air Force base to attempt an intercept
of these objects whereupon they were observed on what is called
height-finder radar to ascend in unison at an extreme rate of
speed. Further, it was later determined for the better part of
this incident, these objects were maneuvering near nuclear
missile silos located southeast of the base at a location called
[Judith] basin.
     Later in this program I will introduce documents obtained
from the United States Air Force that confirm that this type of
nuclear weapons related UFO incident was hardly unique, on the
contrary it has occurred on literally dozens of occasions over
the past three decades. This experience made a very deep
impression on me. By 1973 I began to actively interview former
and retired Air Force personnel regarding classified UFO
incidents. At approximately the same time I became aware of the
work of a group of researchers called NICAP; that is The National
Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon. This was a
civilian UFO research group primarily active from the mid 1950s
through the 1970s.
This organization had on its board of governors, over the years,
such persons as Admiral [Roscoe Hillencoter] who was the first
director of the CIA, Admiral [D.S. Farney] who was the Chief of
the Navy's first guided missile program and former U.S. Senator
Barry Goldwater; in short, not your average bunch of UFO kooks.
     Id like to read a very brief statement delivered at a 1962
NICAP press conference in Washington. The author of this
statement was Admiral [Roscoe Hillencoter] who, again, was the
first director of the CIA: Quote "I know that neither Russia nor
this country has anything even approaching such high speeds and
maneuvers. Behind the scenes high ranking officers are soberly
concerned about the UFOs, but through official secrecy and
ridicule many citizens are led to believe that the unknown flying
objects are nonsense." Endquote.
     By the mid 1970s NICAP and other researchers began to use
for the first time what is called the Freedom of Information Act
to obtain documents about UFOs from our government. Otherwise
known as F.O.I.A. or FOIA, the freedom of information act is a
federal law that allows Americans to petition most government
agencies for the release of classified materials on a variety of
subjects provided that the release of those documents to the
public domain does not jeopardize national security. In the past
two decades this legal approach has been used with mixed success.
As I speak there are now some 10,000 pages of previously
classified CIA, Air Force, FBI, and other intelligence agency
documents relating to UFOs finally in the public domain and
available to you. In a nutshell, what these documents indicate
beyond a reasonable doubt is that so-called flying saucers DO
INDEED EXIST, they are neither American nor Russian secret
weapons. And as you will see for yourself as the evening
progresses despite repeated denials to the public by the Pentagon
for the past 4 decades in effect denying the existence of UFOs;
in reality as the documents indicate, behind the scenes, the
highest levels of the U.S. military and intelligence community
not only fully accept their existence, they have in fact judged
UFOs to be a National Security matter for reasons that I think
will be obvious by the conclusion of this program.
     Now I would like to emphasize, I am not condemning any
government agency for it's participation in programs of secrecy
relating to the UFO phenomenon. Having said that however, my
honest and sincere opinion is that the public has a right and a
very definite need to know the facts. As such, this presentation
is designed to be a grass-roots public information program; it is
offered on a take it or leave it basis. I am not a missionary, I
am not seeking to convert skeptics to so-called believers, but
for those of you who find merit in the material I'll be
presenting, at the conclusion of the program I'll provide an
address to which any one of you can write, if you wish, and
secure up to 600 pages of these now declassified documents on
Ufos. In that way, you will first be able to judge to your
satisfaction that I have fairly and accurately portrayed their
contents; more to the point, you can educate yourself as to what
the U.S. governments true if covert response to UFOs has been for
the past 4 decades.
     The program begins with a 30 minute slide show that compares
and contrasts what we the public have been told by our government
on the subject, with what researchers can now demonstrate has
actually taken place in secrecy. It would not be an exaggeration
to say that the difference between the two is the difference
between day and night. In my slide show, there are numerous
depictions of flying saucers. I stress: unless the narrator notes
them to be photographs, they are on the other hand, for the most
part, simply drawings and illustrations designed to accompany the
narration. Also within my slide show I take a brief look at some
of the abduction experiences, that is, alleged abductions of
individuals by UFO occupants. This is perhaps the most
controversial aspect of an already controversial subject. I have
my own opinion about the better documented of these cases; my
opinion will be evident within the slide show. I will leave it,
however, for each of you to decide for yourself the nature, even
the reality, of these types of alleged experiences.
     Following the slide show I will speak approximately 1 hour
and show documents upon which this program is based. They are
quite dramatic. There are things I think you need to read with
your own eyes. And finally, there will be a question and answer
session.
     What you are about to see in here may seem like Science
Fiction or paranoid delusion or perhaps an elaborate practical
joke. I assure you its none of those things. I would only add
that the only ticket to admission here this evening is an open
mind.

SLIDE SHOW

NARRATOR:  On January 14, 1979 the New York Times reported that
the Central Intelligence Agency had been ordered by a federal
judge to release nearly a thousand pages of secret documents
about UFOs. This decision was the result of a freedom of
information lawsuit brought against the agency by Ground Saucer
Watch, a UFO research organization based in Phoenix, Arizona. In
an interview with the Times, the director of the group, William
Spalding, said that the documents revealed that "UFOs do exist.
They are real. The government has been totally untruthful and the
coverup is massive."
     Since the late 1940s, the American public has been told that
official interest in UFOs rested solely in the activities of
various Air Force investigations, such as the much publicized
Project Blue Book. When Blue Book formally ended in 1969 the
government claimed to have no further interest in the phenomenon.
However, the documents released by the CIA as well as those
obtained from other government agencies now reveal that
throughout the past and up to the present day; the entire U.S.
military and intelligence community has engaged in a high level
policy of secrecy regarding UFOs. And so, at long last, this
officially suppressed information can finally be brought to the
public's attention.
     Here then, is the Hidden History of the UFO phenomenon
presented in the context of events already known to the public.

[Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.]

     The first massive wave of UFO sightings in the United States
began in April, 1947. By early July, disc shaped flying saucers
have been reported in every state except Georgia and West
Virginia. According to eye witnesses, the objects travelled at
tremendous speeds, frequently stopped to hover, and at times
performed incredible maneuvers that would have destroyed any
conventional aircraft.
     In addition to widespread public sightings, many military
personnel observed the unknown objects flying near our most
secret research areas. Including experimental aircraft bases,
rocket test sights, and atomic weapons development centers. But
the facts surrounding all of these incidents remained highly
classified. And several years passed before NICAP investigators
learned of them through former military officers.
     To calm public concern in the wake of the many sightings
that had been reported, the Pentagon put out a press release
stating that the so-called flying saucers were only a combination
of:
     + Solar reflections on low hanging clouds
     + Small meteors that had broken up
and
     + flattened hailstones caused by icing conditions.

     However, shortly after these rather improbably explanations
were issued for public consumption, the then Army Air Force
secretly completed it's first and real analysis of the UFOs.
General Nathan F. [Twining], commander of the division
responsible for the investigation, summarized its findings in a
letter to the Pentagon which remained classified for over 20
years.
     Briefly, the letter reports that:
:The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or
fictitious. There are objects approximating the shape of a disc,
some of which appear flat on bottom and domed on top. These
objects are as large as a man-made aircraft. And have a metallic
or light-reflecting surface. Further they exhibit extreme rates
of climb and maneuverability with no associated sound and take
action which must be considered evasive when contacted by
aircraft and radar.:
     The summary also noted that several sightings have been made
of well-kept formation flights involving 3 to 9 objects. General
[Twining] concluded his letter by recommending that a full-scale
investigation of the UFOs be immediately undertaken. At the
Pentagon, Air Force Headquarters responded by initiating a secret
high priority study of the flying discs code-named Sign.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep]

     In February, 1948 Project Sign began an intensive 6 month
investigation of the UFOs. Initially it was suspected that the
Russians were developing captured German Jet Aircraft into new
highly superior secret weapons, but this was eventually ruled out
by our intelligence agents in Europe.
     On August 5, the project's officers sent their conclusions
about the unknown objects to Air force Headquarters in a report
known as :An Estimate of the Situation:. The situation was the
widespread sightings, the estimate was that the UFOs were
interplanetary space ships engaged in a systematic surveillance
of our world for some unknown purpose.

[Scary music]

This incredible conclusion has never been officially admitted by
The Air Force or any government agency, but the former chief of
Project Blue Book, Captain Edward [Rupelt] and two other officers
have confirmed Project Sign's findings to NICAP and other
researchers. According to Captain [Rupelt] the Air Force feared
that public disclosure of the interplanetary conclusion would
result in a massive national panic. Only 10 years before Orson
Wells' realistic radio play _War of the Worlds_ had caused
thousands of unsuspecting people to flee their homes in terror
believing that Martians had invaded and were destroying Earth
civilization.
     In view of this incident the Air Force felt that it had no
choice but to keep Project Sign's conclusions secret. A short
time later, headquarters issued a press release calling the UFOs
'hoaxes, hallucinations, and the mis-identification of known
objects.'

[Beep Beep Beep Beep]

     Another large wave of UFO sightings occurred in 1952. On
July 16 the United States Coast Guard officially released this
photograph taken by one of it's personnel of four luminous
objects which flew near a Salem, Massachusetts power plant. NICAP
has learned that the Air Force unsuccessfully attempted to halt
publication of this picture and was furious with the Coast Guard
Commander responsible for it's release. 3 days later on July, 19
several UFOs maneuvered above Washington, DC. and at one point
entered the highly restricted air space over the White House.
     F-94 interceptors were launched in pursuit, but were easily
outdistanced by the objects which according to radar reports
raced away at up to speeds of 7,000 miles per hour.
[Audience ohhhhs and ahhhhhs]
This widely publicized case and a nearly identical incident the
following week generated intense public curiosity and speculation
about the UFOs and this greatly worried the Air Force.
     On July 29 General John Sanford, head of intelligence, held
a press conference at the Pentagon and announced that the
Washington sightings were the result of an "atmospheric illusion
caused by a temperature inversion." But this attempt to explain
away the unexplainable did little to dampen public interest in
the phenomenon and a National fascination with flying saucers was
rapidly developing.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep]

     Alarmed by the developments of the previous year the Central
Intelligence secretly took charge of UFO policy in 1953. On
January 18 a CIA sponsored group of scientists known as The
Robertson Panel issued a classified recommendation calling for
the debunking of the flying saucers in order to reduce public
interest in them. This was to be accomplished by planting
articles in magazines and arranging media programming which would
attempt to convince Americans that UFOs were either mis-
identified man-made objects or natural phenomenon. This
recommendation was approved and the secret debunking campaign has
been in effect ever since.
     Some months after the Robertson Panel met, the Air Force
quietly issued regulation 200-2 which established formal
procedures for reporting UFO sightings made by it's personnel and
further forbade the release of such information to the press or
public.
     As the year ended the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a far
more comprehensive regulation on UFOs known as JANAP-146. This
secret order established a top priority communications channel
for all military pilots to use to report airborne UFO sightings.
Previous to this pilots had filed their reports once they had
landed. Now however, they were ordered to immediately transmit a
service report to the nearest Air Force Base which would allow
jets to be rapidly launched to intercept the objects. But JANAP-
146 did not apply to military pilots only. Because many
commercial pilots were also seeing UFOs a decision was made at
the Pentagon to impose the order on the airline companies. Some
years later that move was publicly protested by a group of
veteran pilots as noted in this news account wherein one called
the new policy "A lesson in lying, intrigue, and the Big Brother
attitude carried to the ultimate extreme." The airlines
themselves however agreed to comply with the order.
     Because JANAP-146 is covered by the espionage laws and
stipulates severe penalties for revealing UFO sightings, very few
pilots, military or commercial, have publicly reported their
airborne encounters.
     Collectively the policy decisions of 1953 established a
program of official censorship and covert manipulation of public
opinion regarding UFOs. Throughout the 1950s this program
reinforced the already skeptical attitudes of most Americans who
believed the idea of alien spaceships was utter nonsense. But
unknown to the public an extremely important event was about to
take place.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep]

     In the Fall of 1961 there occurred an incident involving
alleged contact with UFO occupants that would later gain
international recognition. Such stories had been heard before of
course. During the 1950s UFO cultists known as "Contactees"
openly claimed to be in communication with beings from other
worlds who are visiting Earth in their flying saucers. Not
surprisingly, nearly all of these claims proved to be hoaxes or
were made by mentally disturbed persons.
[Audience laughs.]
     But the Case of Betty and Barney Hill was different. Late
one September night the couple was driving a deserted stretch of
road in rural New Hampshire when they spotted a UFO approaching
their car. They then heard a beeping sound and immediately became
drowsy. [Beep Beep Beep Beep] Eventually they found themselves
several miles further down the road with no memory of having
driven there and had lost 2 hours they could not account for.
     Troubled by this strange experience the Hills finally
consulted a nationally known psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin [Si??]
and agreed to undergo time-regression hypnosis. This is a memory
retrieval technique regularly used by doctors for therapeutic
purposes and by law-enforcement agencies to reconstruct crimes.
Under hypnosis, Betty and Barney vividly recall the events of the
missing two hours and later drew pictures of what had happened.
Slowly, and with mounting fear each of them relived a frightening
encounter with alien beings who took them from their car and led
them aboard the now landed UFO. They were then separated and
given lengthy medical examinations. Afterwards, one of the aliens
approached Betty and began to communicate with her in broken
English, she responded by asking the location of the Alien's
planet. At this, the being led her to a large star map which he
indicated showed their home base as well as other solar systems
that they had visited either to trade with or explore.
[Astral moaning music]
Finally, Betty was told that she and Barney would not remember
their experience. They were then led back to their car where they
watched the UFO rapidly depart.
     As fantastic as this story seems, many researchers now
consider it to be a genuine case of contact with beings who are
alien to this planet. One final note about this incident: In 1969
a radar report was obtained from [Peas ?] Air Force base which
indicates that a UFO was indeed tracked on the night, at the
time, and in the area where the Hills claimed have had their
close encounter.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep]

     The largest wave of UFO sightings occurred in 1965. From
coast to coast strange low flying flying objects were reported
almost nightly by people of all ages and walks of life. These
sketches compiled by a NICAP researcher represent a small sample
of hundreds of investigated cases in which truly unknown objects
were judged to have been involved. As the year progressed the
number of reports rose dramatically. On the night of August 2
thousands of people in 4 midwestern states witnessed spectacular
aerial displays by large formations of UFOs. That same night a
multicolored disc was photographed in Tulsa Oklahoma while
several persons watched it perform low altitude maneuvers. This
picture was extensively analyzed, pronounced authentic, and later
published by Life magazine and many newspapers.
     But the year's most incredible development was yet to come.
On the evening of November 9 hundreds of UFO sightings were
reported throughout the northeast. In New York State luminous
objects were seen hovering over 3 very significant locations.

     + A Niagara Falls power plant
     + A [Syracuse] relay station
     + and the heart of New York City

Within moments of the [Syracuse] sighting 9 northeastern states
and parts of Canada experienced the largest power failure in
history. Media accounts including those by NBC news, The
Associated Press, and some local papers openly reported the UFO
sightings and in a few cases suggested that they be investigated
as a possible cause of the blackout. However, before this
speculation could gain much momentum the Federal Power Commission
announced that the problem had been caused by a broken relay in a
Canadian power plant. This answer was accepted by the press and
public and the UFO angle was quickly forgotten. But, the official
explanation was untrue. Major [Keyhoe ?] reports that a private
investigation by the utilities industry later concluded that the
relay had NOT broken, but had been tripped by a huge,
unexplainable surge of power. The only major paper which
attempted to follow up on a possible UFO connection with the
outage was the Boston Record America. But the paper's editors
told a NICAP investigator that shortly after publishing this
account of the Niagara Falls sighting they had been called by an
Air Force officer at the Pentagon and severely reprimanded for
printing the story.
     In any event, the public at large remained unaware of the
presence of UFOs during the great northeast blackout.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep]
[My friend in reference to the beeping whispers:
 "I'm getting sleepy."]

     In 1966 and 67 UFOs were repeatedly sighted and tracked on
radar as they maneuvered near our Nuclear Missile installations
in 3 western states. Although these incidents were highly
classified NICAP soon learned of them through it's contacts
within the military. Public sightings meanwhile were making
headlines. In March 1966 dramatic UFO reports in Michigan
captured national attention and thereby threatened to undermine
the official coverup. Responding to this crisis, the Air Force
ordered it's civilian consultant Dr. J. Allen Hynek to hold a
press conference and carefully explain the sightings. Dr. Hynek
began by cautiously suggesting that at least some of the objects
may have been luminous balls of marsh gas [local audience
snicker] since a few of the UFOs had been seen over a swamp.
Without waiting for him to finish indignant reporters broke for
the phones to tell their papers what they considered to be One
Official Debunking Answer Too Many. Apparently their editors
agreed, because general press reaction was openly hostile and
cartoonists had a field day. [Big laugh at a comic where caveman
observer sees UFO/abduction and remarks: Whoa, the swamp gas sure
is restless tonight.] [Diddly beeping]
     A short time later in the face of mounting criticism from
the press, public, and congress.. Secretary of the Air Force
Gerald Brown appeared on Capitol Hill and insisted that there was
no evidence that the UFOs were interplanetary space craft.
     But while this raging controversy held the public's eye,
behind the scenes, the mystery itself was continuing to unfold.
In 1967 a Nebraska policeman had an encounter which was similar
to that of Betty and Barney Hill which also resulted in a
subsequent loss of memory. Later under time-regression hypnosis
Patrolman Herbert [Schurmer] fearfully relived a confrontation
with 3 alien beings who had emerged from a landed UFO.
[Creepy Astral Sweeping]
     ::According to the hypnotic transcripts one of the beings
apparently communicated with the trooper both verbally and
telepathically telling him that they were intentionally showing
off their craft and occasionally contacting individuals to slowly
prepare the world when they would reveal themselves completely.
The alien also said that people should have no fear of them
because their intentions are not hostile.::

[Beep beep Beep beep]

     In addition to hundreds of sightings researchers note that
there were over 50 cases involving reliable people who reported
being abducted by UFO occupants. While nearly all of these
incidents went unmentioned in the press one of them managed to
gain international attention.
     On October 11 in [Pasagoula] Mississippi two shipyard
workers, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker told authorities that
an egg shaped UFO suddenly landed near them as they fished from a
pier. 3 silvery suited creatures then floated from the craft and
carried the terrified men aboard where they were given medical
examinations. After several minutes they were released and the
UFO rapidly departed.
     "You just cant make people believe", Hickson was later
quoted as saying. "But they better wake up and start believing.
We are not alone and that's all there is to it."
[Scary sound]

[Beep Beep]

In 1975 there occurred a second rash of sightings at our nuclear
related military facilities. Over a two week period UFOs
maneuvered near missile sights and bomber bases in Montana,
Michigan, and Maine. As with similar incidents in the mid 60s all
of these sightings were classified and the public and the press
remain, for the moment, unaware of their existence.

[Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep]

In the fall of 1978 a large international wave of sightings
suddenly erupted. The most dramatic of these occurred near New
Zealand and involved an airborne television crew who filmed a UFO
that flew alongside their plane for several minutes. This object
and 4 others were also tracked on radar. Then in December,
several UFO related Defense Department records were secured
through a freedom of information suit brought against the
government by various research groups. Among other things, the
records detailed the classified missile and bomber base sightings
which had occurred in 1975. According to the Washington Post the
documents described the UFOs as brightly lighted, fast-moving
vehicles that hovered over nuclear weapons storage areas and
evaded all pursuit efforts.

[Beep Beep Beep]

In 1982 the Supreme Court refused to hear a case in which a
research group called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy had sued the
National Security Agency in effort to obtain its classified UFO
documents. In a lower court The Agency admitted that it had over
150 UFO related files but refused to release them claiming it's
intelligence gathering methods and the National Security of the
United States would be jeopardized if the documents were made
public. The Federal Judge hearing the case ruled in the NSAs
favor. Eventually heavily censored copies of the documents were
released. Although these revealed virtually nothing this episode
nevertheless illustrated the US Governments repeated use of the
National Security laws to withhold information about UFOs from
the public.

In 1985 two former Air Force officers, Lieutenant Robert M.
Jacobs and Major Florenz L. [Mansmen], publicly disclosed their
involvement in a highly classified incident that had occurred
over 20 years earlier. Jacobs revealed that an Air Force missile
test launched on September 15 1964 from [Vandenburg] Air Force
base in California had a bizarre encounter with a UFO high over
the Pacific Ocean. The former lieutenant was in charge of a
photographic team that was filming the launch through a high
powered radar guided telescope. Both Jacobs and his superior,
Major [Mansmen], confirmed that when the film of the test was
examined it revealed that the missile dummy nuclear warhead had
been approached by a disc shaped object as it raced down the
range towards it's target. The former Major has stated that
analysis of the film demonstrated that the UFO was a classic
disc. The center seemed to be a raised bubble. The entire lower
saucer shape was glowing and rotating slowly. Said [Mansmen],
"The assumption was that it was extraterrestrial."
     Analyzing the film frame by frame an Air Force team was
amazed to find that the UFO began to pace the dummy warhead.
Abruptly, 4 beams of light flashed from the disc in rapid
succession. Seconds later, the warhead began to tumble and soon
fell into the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles short of it's
target. According to Major [Mansmen] the film of this UFO
incident was quickly confiscated by the CIA and everyone with
knowledge of it was sworn to secrecy.

[Beep Beep Beep]

     In 1990, the findings of an important UFO study were
published. Researchers Kevin Randall and Don [Schmidt] had spent
3 years investigating the so-called Roswell Incident. This case
involved the secret recovery of a large quantity of very strange
wreckage by the Army Air Force in July 1947 in a remote part of
New Mexico. At first, the military issued a press release stating
that a crashed flying disc had been recovered. Shortly
thereafter,  however, the chief of the 8th Air Force held a press
conference and claimed that the supposed flying saucer was only a
downed weather balloon. But that explanation contradicts the
testimony of former Colonel Jesse A. Marcel who was the first
military man to arrive at the crash site. Marcel stated that the
debris which was strewn over an area 3 quarters of a mile long
was metallic and extremely light weight, but could not be cut or
dented.. and when bent quickly returned to it's original shape.
     Researchers Randall and [Schmidt] tracked down other eye-
witnesses who stated that 50 to 60 uniformed men spent nearly 3
days combing the crash site trying to retrieve every last piece
of wreckage. It was also learned from retired military sources
that 7 secret Air Force flights took the debris and a large
mysterious crate to various destinations immediately after the
recovery operation. In all, over 200 persons have provided
testimony that contradict the official weather balloon
explanation. One of these, Retired Colonel Thomas [DuBoughes ??]
who was General [Reighmes ?] agitant in 1947 now flatly states
that the weather balloon announcement was a cover story designed
to deflate media interest in the crash.
     And so we must ask, Did a flying saucer crash in New Mexico
in 1947? The quest for the facts continues. Finally, it must be
noted that 6 witnesses connected with the Roswell incidents have
stated that they had seen the bodies of dead alien beings that
were recovered from the wreckage.

[Audience Bustling after the Slide Show]

HASTINGS: Ok, id like to begin this portion of the program not
with a document, but rather a news count. And..
U.S. News and World Report is considered by most people to be a
fairly conservative, relatively respectable news weekly. Every
issue contains a feature called 'Washington Whispers' in which a
variety of subjects are covered very briefly based on information
in the hand's of this magazine's reporters and yet at time of
publication have not received widespread attention.

Next slide please; its on the center one Paul.

In the spring of 1977 shortly after the Carter administration
came to office, U.S. News made the prediction that before the
year was out someone in the new administration, perhaps President
Carter himself, would release information on UFOs to the public.
Information this magazine chose to characterize as 'unsettling
disclosures'. Now this in fact never took place; there was no
official release of information on UFOs by the Carter regime.
However, at about the same time a number of documents began to
come forward, become available to the public, through the freedom
of information act. Those documents indicate that at least as
early as January of 1953 the group in our agent, uh, the group,
rather, in our government having overall responsibility for
coordinating UFO research is indeed the Central Intelligence
Agency. So in my opinion this prediction by U.S. News was dead-on
target.

Next Slide please.

As I indicated earlier. As I speak I would like to share with you
excerpts from some of the documents upon which this program is
based. I will be the first to admit that reading documents on a
screen is not terribly exciting, in and of itself, but ive made
some rather dramatic assertions in the course of the program and
I think its incumbent upon me to be able to document at least a
few of them in this program. Again, at the conclusion of the
program I will provide an address that will allow any one of you
to acquire up to 600 pages of these documents to read at your
leisure. I will state at this juncture that some of the
reproduction quality of the documents, in this case a CIA memo
from 1952, the legibility is rather marginal. Unfortunately, the
document appears exactly as it was released to researchers from
the agency and we cannot therefore improve upon the quality.
Most of what Im going to show you will be entirely legible. This
type of venue with a flat floor CD plan makes it difficult to
read type. If those of you who cant see clearly would like to
shift chairs thats fine by me.

In the next few minutes I will be presenting items relating to:
One(1), the takeover of the official policy of secrecy on UFOs by
        the CIA.
Two(2), documents relating to repeated UFO sightings decade after
        decade at nuclear weapons related facilities.
Three(3), a document from September of 1976 that, believe it or
          not, concerns nothing less than a blow by blow account
          of an aerial dogfight between a UFO and a F-4 Phantom
          Aircraft. Copies of this particular document were sent
          to everyone from the White House to the Secretary of
          State and the highest levels of the U.S. government.
And Finally(4), a document that was sent to FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover in March of 1950 that states in black and white that the
U.S. government has secretly recovered crashed flying saucers.

-------
This internal CIA memorandum is from December of 1952. It was
written by one Dr. Marshal Chadwell who was the assistant
director of a component of the CIA called the Office of
Scientific Intelligence. This memo we're about to read was
directed to the then director of CIA, General Walter B. Smith.

Next slide please.

Halfway down, this same page in paragraph 4.. We now know that
the then director was informed by Dr. Chadwell that during the
proceeding few months CIA had been apprised of, informed of,
numerous overflights by unknown aerial objects at some of this
nation's most sensitive research and development facilities,
specifically nuclear weapons related areas.

Picking up paragraph 4, third line down, quote:
:: At this time, the reports of incidents convince us
that must have immediate attention::

One sentence further along it states, quote:
:: Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and
travelling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense
installations are of such nature that they are not attributable
to natural phenomenon or known types of aerial vehicles::

Next slide please.

Consequently, this memo concludes with Dr. Chadwell recommending
that the Director of CIA approach the NSC, the National Security
Council with this matter.

Quote:
:: Attached hereto is a draft memorandum to the National Security
Council and a simple draft NSC directive establishing this matter
as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense
research and development community::

Next slide please.

The attached National Security Council directive itself invokes
at the top what is called the National Security Act of 1947 and
goes on to spell out how the CIA is to coordinate covert UFO
research with other agencies within the U.S. government. The
National Security Council by the way is made up of the President,
Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of CIA. There is no group
higher in the United States government in terms of national
security policy formulation.

[Transcriber's note: Please note the next paragraph
 is one big honking mongoloid of a sentence.]

Now, ...very... dry....stuff.. Very bureaucratic.. The point is:
this document lays bare for the first time, decades later, for
public inspection, the fact that while the Pentagon through
official press releases and other announcements were dismissing
UFOs as hoaxes, hallucinations, misidentified man-made or natural
phenomenon year in and year out, in reality, behind the scenes,
the U.S. government was fully aware of and highly alarmed by
sightings of unknown aerial objects that flew higher, faster,
were more maneuverable than anything we had flying, anything our
intelligence agents said the Russians were flying.. these objects
could come and go at will through American air space and if that
were not enough from a National Security standpoint, we did not
know the intent of the uh.. persons flying, or beings flying
these whoever the pilots were.. if that were not enough the
government knew that at least as early as 1948 these objects
seemed to have a distinct interest in our nuclear weapons
facilities.

Next slide please.

------
I'd like to show you now two FBI memoranda from this period that
describe UFO sightings from my home state of New Mexico in a
little greater detail.

This FBI memo is from January of 1949. It was directed to the
then director of CIA, er excuse me, FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. It was
authored by the special agent in charge of the San Antonio FBI
office. The subject of this memo is, quote:
:: PROTECTION OF VITAL INSTALLATIONS ::

I think the first paragraph is worth reading in its entirety,
quote:    [Hastings in parenthesis]
:: At recent weekly intelligence conferences of G2, :
(which was Army Intelligence) : ONI, : (that is, the office of
Naval Intelligence) : OSI, : (which is a counter intelligence
component of the Air Force to which my father belonged) : and FBI
in the 4th Army area, officers of G2 4th Army have discussed the
matter of unidentified aircraft or unidentified aerial
phenomenon; otherwise known as flying discs, flying saucers, and
balls of fire.: (the next sentence was underlined presumably for
emphasis) : This matter is considered top secret by intelligence
officers of both the Army and the Air Forces. ::

Next slide please.

At the bottom of this same page in the last fairly lengthy
paragraph we now know that the director of the FBI was informed
that during the preceding two months there had been numerous
sightings of unidentified flying objects near the Los Alamos
nuclear weapons laboratories where only some 4 years earlier our
government had secretly developed this planet's first nuclear
weapons which we used against Japan. If you choose to read this
memo, halfway down, para.. at the last fairly lengthy paragraph
you can see that persons at Los Alamos who were reporting the
UFOs to their security personnel included, quote:
:: special agents of the office of special investigation : (which
was Air Force counterintelligence) : airline pilots, military
pilots, and Los Alamos security inspectors ::

Next slide please.

A second FBI memorandum from approximately a year and a half
later indicates that the UFO sightings around Los Alamos and
other sensitive highly classified research facilities in New
Mexico had occurred with alarming frequency in the preceding 18
months or so.

In the next slide please, halfway down the same page there is a
brief one or two sentence description of what persons at Los
Alamos and elsewhere were reporting as having witnessed. They
included, One(1)
::Green fireballs, objects moving at high speed in shapes
resembling half-moons, circles, and discs emitting green light.::

We know from other documents that these green fireballs were
described as performing maneuvers, obviously were not meteors or
meteorites on a straight line trajectory but indeed were doing
all sorts of maneuvers suggesting they were either under
intelligent control or remote control. Also reported were two(2)
:: discs, round flat shaped objects or phenomenon moving at fast
velocity and emitting a [bright?] white light or reflected
light::

The memo goes on to say that some of the objects were meteor in
appearance, meteorlike in appearance, and were later in fact
judged to be so. But approximately 150 sightings of these objects
were observed by personnel near very sensitive facili..

[Buuuurrrpp..  my tape recorder flipped the tape. Sorry.]

...included that of these 150 or so sightings 75 or 50% were
judged to be of.. uh.. objects that were in fact not natural or
man made phenomenon. Now in addition to this document and in
addition to the sightings at Los Alamos many other documents from
this era, late 40s early 50s, um.. available to you, too numerous
for me to show you one after the other in this type of
presentation, indicate that in addition to Los Alamos other UFO
sightings were concentrated around the Oakridge National
Laboratories in Tennessee, a facility at that time second only to
Los Alamos in terms of its developm.., importance to the
development of nuclear weapons in this country. Other documents
deal with UFO sightings repeatedly occurring around the Hanford
military reservation in Washington State [my friend whispers
something about Twin Peaks] which was at that time the world's
largest nuclear weapons grade plutonium production facility.

To summarize, late 40s early 50s, the Pentagon began dismissing,
at least publicly, UFO sightings as nothing to be alarmed by,
nothing out of the ordinary, in reality, behind the scenes, the
highest levels, and I mean up to the National Security Council
were extremely concerned by these objects coming into American
air space and repeatedly maneuvering near our nuclear weapons
related facilities.

Next slide please.

-------
Moving on to the decade of the 1970s. In my slide show I note the
fact that during the fall of 1975 a number of strategic air
command bases in Maine, Michigan, and  Montana experienced a rash
of UFO sightings near nuclear weapons related installations.
Either what are called weapons storage areas, bunkers containing
nuclear bombs or missile warheads for storage, or at weapons
deployment sights such as missile silos. I would like to share
with you now parts of an officially released Air Force letter
detailing UFO sightings near nuclear missile silos outside of
[Maustrum] Air Force base, Great Falls,  Montana, in early
November 1975.

Next slide please.

There are far too many entries in this 4 page letter for me to
read them all. I would like to quote a few to give you a sense of
what security alert teams called SATs, these are heavily armed
military police who guard the missile silos were reporting to
command personnel at [Maumstrum] Air Force base in November of
1975. These excerpts are verbatim, that is word for word excerpts
from what are called commander's logs. In this instance commander
of [Maumstrum] Air Force base compiling data detailing summaries
of these incidents to be sent up the chain of command to
Washington. Picking up at the top.

:: 7, November 75. Received a call from the 341st Strategic Air
Command post saying that the following missile locations reported

seeing a large, red to orange to yellow object ::
It then lists the missile silos by their coded designations, M1
etc. The next entry,

[too difficult to discern Hastings commentary from quote
 simply by tone of voice so I chunked the following bit
 together]

: SAC, (in this case Strategic Air Command) advise that the
Launch Control Facility, LCF, (thats the blockhouse that has the
electronics that actually would launch nuclear missiles) at
[Harleton?] Montana observed an object which emitted a light
which illuminated the site driveway. :

 Later that same evening:

: SAC advise missile sight K1 says very bright object to their
east is now southeast of them and they are looking at it with
binoculars. Object seems to have lights, several on it, but no
distinct pattern. The orange-gold object overhead also has small
lights on it :

 And then the last entry from the same evening:

: Missile sight L1 reports that the object to their northeast
seems to be issuing a black object from it - tubular in shape. In
all this time surveillance : (meaning radar) : has not been able
to detect any sort of track except for known traffic. :

Shortly, we'll see that that in fact changed, and ultimately
radar contact was established with these objects in the air
simultaneous to the observations of them from the ground by the
security alert team members.

Next slide please.

A couple of entries from 8, November 75.. and if you could
[rack?] through focus on that for me, Paul..

:: A security camera team at missile sight k4 reported UFO with
white lights, one red light 50 yards behind white light.
Personnel at k1 seeing same object. ::

There are then some entries which you may read for yourself if
you wish indicating as I have said that ultimately radar contact
with the UFOs was in fact established at [Maumstrum] and other
radar facilities across the western United States. Once that
occurred and these object's positions were known, Jets were
launched from [Maumstrum] Air Force base to attempt an intercept
of them not the least because they were maneuvering in near air
space above nuclear missiles very sensitive strategic offensive
weapons sites.

In the second to the last entry we read, quote:
:: From SAC command post. From 4 different points : (meaning
missile locations) : observed objects and fighters. When fighters
arrived in the area the lights went out. When fighters departed
the lights came back on. : (and then it says, and this is
important..) : To NCLC. ::
Indicating that the commander of [Maumstrum] Air Force base was
so concerned about the incursion into sensitive air space near
these sights by unknown aerial objects, unknown origin, unknown
intent, that the commander flashed information via teletype to
what is called the NORAD combat operations center in Colorado
Springs to inform them of what was taking place. This is
precisely the action the commander would have taken if he had
some evidence or concern that hostile intent, sabotage perhaps,
was being directed against these missiles.

In the last entry, from the same evening,
:: From SAC command post. Missile sight L5 reported object
increased in speed, high velocity, raised in altitude, and now
cannot tell object from the stars ::

That is almost a word for word description to one provided me at
[Maumstrum] some 8 years earlier, except in the case when I was
there it was an air traffic control radar account, a height
finder radar tracking of 5 unknown targets performing a high
speed vertical ascent. In this instance apparently you have a
single object observed by one or more security guards at the
silos either by naked eye or through binoculars witnessing the
same object or type of object ascending and disappearing against
the background of stars very quickly.

Now the entry directly below the one that I just read I think is
perhaps the most revealing in this entire 4 page letter. In that
apparently the actual shape of the object could be discerned by
security personnel on the ground, it was not a bright light or
series of lights. Quote,

:: SAC command post reports UFO 20 miles southeast of Lewistown.
Orange white disc object. 24th NORAD region surveillance checking
area, surveillance unable to get height check. ::

Next slide please. Uh.. one more. Next slide please. There we go.


One last document relating to nuclear weapons cases. You'll note
that the appearance of this slide is markedly different than the
preceding slides. Thats because this is not a part of the
officially released Air Force letter that I have been excerpting
from. This in fact is a leaked document. Now I do not and never
have advocated the leaking of U.S. government documents on the
subject of UFOs or any other subject. But in 1977 someone within
the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA, released this teletype
message and two related documents to a number of news
organizations including the Washington Post. Indeed this
documentation provided enough leading information to researchers
to allow them to file freedom of information requests, that
generated the documents that I have been showing you previously.
This deals with cases similar to those that I have been
discussing, same time frame, November of 1975, except at other
locations. Picking up fourth line down, part 3.

:: [Mynot?] Air Force Base : (which is in North Dakota) : on 10
November reported that the site was buzzed by a bright object the
size of a car at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. There was no
noise emitted by the vehicle. ::

And finally, part 4.

:: This morning, 11 November 75, Canadian Forces Station Falcon
Bridge : (which is in Ontario) : reported search and height
finder radar pings on an object 25 to 30 nautical miles south of
the site. Ranging in altitude from 26,000 to 72,000 feet. : (For
point of reference commercial airliners fly at approximately
30,000 feet) : the site commander and other personnel say that
the object appeared as a bright star but much closer. With
binoculars the object appeared as a 100 foot diameter sphere and
appeared to have craters around the outside. ::

Now first let me emphasize that what I have presented here is a
very small part of the total documents relating to nuclear
weapons incidents involving UFOs. I think the obvious question is
'What is going on here?'  and in my opinion the honest answer is
that researchers simply do not have enough information, enough
pieces of the puzzle, to draw any final conclusions.

I will however bring to your attention the fact that over the
past two decades dozens, literally dozens, of former and retired
security alert team members or individuals who were assigned to
missile and maintenance squadrons have been interviewed by
researchers such as myself, I have interviewed nearly 20 of these
gentlemen, what they have told us is startling to say the least.
These individuals who provide us service records and other
documentation corroborating their prepense in the squadrons at
the bases they maintain they were in and at have stated that when
these disc shape objects were sighted and tracked on radar
hovering near our missiles, missiles lost all electrical power.
All electronics went off line. Depending case to case. In some
instances for simply a few minutes, in one case for which we have
multiple sources, individuals talking about this one particular
case, over 24 hours elapsed during which there was no power
available to these missile systems. They were in effect
unlaunchable. Our sources further state, if that were not enough,
that all efforts on the part of missile maintenance squadron
personnel, these are missile technical persons, as well as
civilian utility company personnel, power company personnel, to
attempt to reinstate power to these missiles, to get them back on
line, proved fruitless. Our sources state that nothing that was
done based on their expertise had any effect whatsoever to get
these missiles functioning once again and YET, without any
outside intervention, and our sources are adamant about this,
without any outside intervention, power suddenly reinstated
itself to these missile systems.

Now my opinion is that these individuals are truthful and
sincere. Indeed one document has become available corroborating
one of these power losses at [Mynot] Air Force base in August
1966 and I believe in time additional documents and sources will
become available to corroborate these individuals assertions.

For those of you who may have seen approximately 2 months ago the
ABC prime time program on Thursday evenings hosted by Sam
Donaldson umm.. there was a segment in which former Soviet KGB,
that is state security police, and former Soviet military
personnel, allowed themselves to be interviewed by western
journalists for the first time, discussing UFO sightings in the
former Soviet Union. One of the individuals interviewed on this
ABC news program indicated that the Soviets were having their
problems with UFOs at their nuclear silos. This one former
military person stated that at one point in the early 1980s the
entire electronics involving launch sequence at one facility
began to function on its own with no human intervention, began
going through what would have been a launch sequence, and
according to this man while the technicians were running around
terrified that this could be a launching of an actual missile
toward the United States, the system suddenly shut itself down.

Now this is something I predicted 10 years ago. I was confident
based on the testimony provided me and other researchers about
these types of incidents at our nuclear missile installations. Im
not psychic but Id seeme.. it seemed logical to me that if these
things were indeed occurring here I was willing to bet that the
Soviets were experiencing the same type of bizarre incidents. And
apparently if these former Soviet military and KGB persons are to
be believed, that indeed did take place.

Now my opinion is that perhaps one of the reasons our government
has chosen to keep its rather extensive knowledge of the UFO
phenomenon from public view year after year is perhaps its
uncertainty or apprehension as to what public response, what
reaction would be, if this type of information were widely and
openly disseminated. Thats simply a personal opinion.

Next slide please. Moving on to another area.

--------
In my slide show I mentioned that in July of 1952 literally
dozens of UFOs overflew this nation's capital on two successive
weekends. These objects were tracked on military and civilian
radar in the greater Washington D.C. area. Tracking data
indicated they were in essence at times hovering at other times
they performed speeds, performed maneuvers at speeds in the
neighborhood of 7,000 miles per hour. These incidents were highly
publicized. Uhh.. newspapers such as the Washington Post, the
Wall Street Journal, the New York Times carried detailed stories
about them. Shortly thereafter these same newspapers and in this
case the Associated press published articles suggesting that as a
result of these overflights of the nation's capitol by these
unknown aerial objects the Pentagon had implemented a shoot order
to intercept the pilots to in effect fire upon UFOs should the
opportunity present itself. [?]

Now I have heard and other researchers have heard hundreds and
hundreds of rumors. Stories largely unsubstantiated, stories
about alleged aerial intercept attempts of UFOs by military
interceptors. There is to my knowledge however only one document
currently in the public domain that describes one of these
intercept attempts in any kind of detail, it is intriguing to say
the least, and I would like to share it with you now.

Next slide please.

This is the top half of the first page of a 3 page teletype
message called a [Twix?]  This that we are about to read was sent
from the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran in September of 1976.
Copies of this teletype were directed to, this is the actual
routing of the message, beginning at the top the..
:: JCS : (Joint Cheifs of Staff who are the heads of the military
services received a copy. Reading one line at a time..) : Sec
State : (That is to say Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
received a copy) : CIA, National Security Council, White House,
Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Naval Operations, :
(Navy operations) : Chief of Staff of the Army : (further along)
: Sec Def : (which is to say, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown
received a copy) ::

In short, the creme of the creme of the intelligence community
and national security apparatus in this nation received a copies
of what we are about to read. Now, before we actually look at
this I have to give you a little background.  In September of
1976 when this memorandum or teletype message was sent from our
embassy in Iran to Washington, the Shaw was still in power, this
is prior to the embassy hostage crisis, and the Ayatollah
Khomeni's regime. At that time our government had what were
called MAGs.. military assistance and advisory groups in Iran
training the Shaw's military forces. This incident involved two
American trained Iranian Air Force pilots flying two American
built F-4 Phantom aircraft and describes what occurred when they
attempted to intercept an unidentified flying object north of the
nation's capitol of Tehran. Now, the actual transmission of this
teletype begins at the bottom of the first page, there were only
two lines on that first page so I did not devote a slide to it.
It indicates that persons at a place called [Cheroke?] Air Force
Base had received calls from citizens in the [Chemaron?] district
of Tehran reporting that they had seen strange objects in the
sky. Some reported a kind of bird like object while others
reported a helicopter with a light on. There were no helicopters
airborne at that time. The black gap in the next paragraph was a
reference to one of these Iranians at [Cheroke] Air Force base.
This individuals name was censored by the U.S. state department
when this document was released through the freedom of
information act. In any event this individual told the citizen it
was only stars and had talked to the [Miribad] air traffic
control tower. He decided to look for himself. He noticed an
object in the sky similar to a star but bigger and brighter. He
decided to scramble, that is launch an F-4 from [Cheroke] Air
Force base to investigate.

:: B) At 01:30 (hours) on the 19th the F-4 took off and preceded
to a point about 40 nautical miles north of Tehran. Due to it's
brilliance the object was clearly visible from 70 miles away. As
the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles he lost all
instrumentation and communications. He broke off the intercept
and headed back to [Cheroke]. When the F-4 turned away from the
object and apparently was no longer a threat to it the aircraft
regained all instrumentation and communications. ::
::    At 01:40 (hours) a second F-4 was launched. ::

There are then some lines devoted to navigational jargon.

Next slide please.

Picking up a paragraph C which is two lines below the top white
dot.

:: C) The size of the radar return was comparable to that of a
707 tanker. : (thats the military version of a Boeing 707
jetliner.. quite large) : the visual size of the object was
difficult to discern because of its intense brilliance. The light
that it gave off was that of flashing strobe lights arranged in a
rectangular pattern and alternating blue, green, red, and orange
in color. The sequence of the lights was so fast that all the
colors could be seen at once. ::

And now the action intensifies significantly...

:: The object and pursuing F-4 continued on a course to the south
of Tehran when another object brightly lighted object estimated
to be one half to one third the apparent size of the moon came
out of the original object. This second object headed straight
toward the F-4 at a very fast rate of speed. The pilot attempted
to fire an A9 (that is, air to air missile) at the object but at
that instant his weapons control panel went off and he lost all
communications. At this point the pilot initiated a turn and
negative G (or gravity dive) to get away. As he turned the object
fell in trail at what appeared to be about 3-4 nautical miles. As
he continued in his turn away from the primary object the second
object went to the inside of his turn and then returned to the
primary object for a perfect rejoin. ::

:: D) Shortly after the second object joined up with the primary
object another object appeared to come out of : (next slide
please) : the other side of the primary object going straight
down at a great rate of speed. The F-4 crew had regained
communications and the weapons control panel and watched the
object approach the ground anticipating a large explosion. This
object appeared to come to rest gently on the Earth and cast a
very bright light over an area of 2-3 kilometers. ::

There are then some lines devoted to the pilot returning to
[Cheroke] Air force base. Upon debriefing it was determined that
this pilot and indeed the pilot who had returned to base earlier
had to land their aircraft by instruments because their night
vision was severely impaired by the brilliance of the UFO. But
the aerial encounter wasnt over yet. Picking up 3 lines above the
lower white dot.

:: While the F-4 was on a long final approach the crew noticed
another cylinder shaped object about the size of a T-Bird at 10
meters : (A TBird is a small military jet training aircraft) :
with bright steady lights on each end and a flasher in the

Again, upon debriefing it was determined that this reference to a
T-Bird at 10 meters was based on the pilot and the backseater, as
hes called, radarman on this aircraft, stating to their
debriefers that as they were approaching the base for a final
touchdown this object, cylinder shaped object, in effect buzzed
their aircraft narrowly missing it at an estimated distance of 10
meters or some 30 feet.

And finally this teletype concludes with paragraph E which is
about 5 lines below the top white dot.

:: E) During daylight, the F-4 crew was taken out to the area in
a helicopter where the object apparently had landed. Nothing was
noticed at the spot where they thought the object landed : (a dry
lakebed) : but as they circled off to the west of the area they
picked up a very noticeable beeper signal. At the point where the
return was loudest was a small house with a garden. They landed
and asked the people within if they had noticed anything strange
last night the people talked about a loud noise and a very bright
light like lightning. The aircraft and area where the object is
believed to have landed are being checked for possible radiation.

And then finally, this last gap in the final paragraph is a
reference to the defense attache' at the U.S. embassy indicating
he will forward more information to Washington as it becomes
available. Again, the U.S. State department censored this
individual's identity at the time this was released.

Now, it has been determined that the defense intelligence
agencies, the military CIA, did conduct a exhaustive analysis of
this case. They have admitted that they did issue a report
relating to their investigation. They maintain however in
response to freedom of information requests by researchers that
information in this report is exempt from provisions of the
freedom of information act and to my knowledge have these many
years thus far refused to release this particular report to the
public. And so we as researchers and you the public cannot know
much more about this case then what I have presented here.

Interestingly, the FOX program Sightings which does UFO segments
actually had taped for the first time to my knowledge a number of
the military personnel at [Cheroke] Air Force Base including some
pilots who were involved in this incident. Theyve all fled Iran
and the Ayatollah regime. They now live in Western Europe or the
United States. And the individuals corroborated in this program
precisely the events that were presented here. And one of the
individuals were asked by the interviewer 'Could this have been a
spy plane?' and his response was "Perhaps a spy plane from outer
space."

One last document.

I noted earlier that the reproduction quality of some of the
documents in the public domain was rather poor. This one wins a
prize in that regard I think. But what it has to say is rather
interesting.

This FBI memo was sent to the then director J. Edgar Hoover on
March 22, 1950. It was written by one Guy [Ontel?] who was the
special agent in charge of the Washington FBI office. The subject
of this memo is quote:
::  Flying Saucers Information Concerning ::

The first sentence and other parts of the memo have been censored
by the FBI when this was released in 1976 through the freedom of
information act.

As much of it as we can read, as is, is as follows:

::  The following information was furnished especially for :
(whoever) : by : (whoever) :  An investigator for the Air Force
stated that that three so-called flying saucers had been
recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in
shape with raised centers. Approximately 50 feet in diameter.
Each one was occupied by 3 bodies of human shape but only 3 feet
tall. Dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body
was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by
speed flyers and test pilots. According to Mr. : (whoevers) :
informant the saucers were found in New Mexico due to the fact
that the government has a very high power radar setup in that
area and it is believed that the radar interferes with the
control mechanism of the saucers. No further evaluation was
attempted by special agent : (whoever) : concerning the above. ::

Now, at first glance this is very intriguing stuff. Some have
called this the smoking gun document, the document that proves
that the government has in its possession craft and bodies
confirming the extra-terrestrial nature of the UFOs. In my
opinion, however, it falls far short of that. In the first
instance the name of the original source of the information and
the FBI special agent to whom the information was given; those
individual's identities remain unknown. Assuming optimistically
that they are still alive 44 years after the writing of this
document, researchers cannot approach them to attempt to illicit
additional information that would either tend to confirm or
refute the statements made in this memorandum. Beyond that very
fundamental problem the document is very vaguely worded. It does
not for example identify the specific location of this radar
installation in New Mexico, it does not indicate clearly whether
these alleged crashes occurred simultaneously or over some period
of time, it does identify what component or components of the
military or the government were involved in the recovery of these
alleged craft, crashed craft, and it gives no hint whatsoever as
to what became of these craft and bodies if indeed they were
recovered.

So, if one is to be conservative all one can say is that in March
of 1950, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, was privately
informed that the government had secretly recovered crashed
flying saucers and if you read this I think the inference is that
we are dealing with craft piloted by beings whos origin is not of
this planet. Let me assure you this is absolutely authentic, any
one of you could write to the FBI tomorrow, direct your letter to
the freedom of information officer at the bureau, mention the
date of this memorandum, you can get a copy directly from
Washington if you wish.

This may or may not relate to the so-called Roswell incident
which occurred some 3 years earlier. Now Ive covered that briefly
in my slide show, this particular episode has gotten quite a bit
of national attention in recent years through programs such as
Unsolved Mysteries. I would only add at this juncture that two
researchers; one named Kevin Randall, the other Don Schmidt have
interviewed and gotten on record over 200 former and retired
military personnel including two retired Air Force generals
making statements finally for the first time as to what really
occurred in southeastern New Mexico in July of 1947. I mentioned
General Thomas [DuBoughes ?] who stated he knew for a fact that
the weather balloon story was a cover story designed to get media
attention and public attention away from the recovery operation
back in New Mexico. The second person worth mentioning I believe
is retired Air Force brigadier general Arthur Exxon. In 1990
researcher Kevin Randall got general Exxon to state in a recorded
interview that he, Exxon, was at Wright Field, later Wright
Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio, when according to
later General Exxon stated literally planeloads of debris from
this object arrived at the base for analysis. There are at that
base even to this day components of aeronautical engineering
teams which are engaged in various technology assessments of
foreign aircraft. According to general Exxon in the months that
he was at Wright field before being transferred elsewhere he was
told by persons involved in these attempts to analyze this
recovered debris, that no headway could be made, they could not
determine its origin or of method of manufacture; that it was
extraordinary to say the least and uny, uhh.. unlike anything
that either we or the then Soviet Union was known to have.

At one point during this taped interview with Kevin Randall,
general Exxon refers to the object recovered at Roswell as
quote:  :: A craft from space :: endquote.

For those of you who may have seen the Larry King UFO special
that aired this past October 1st, you may have seen a brief taped
segment with former U.S. senator Barry Goldwater. Goldwater, for
those of you too young to remember was the republican
presidential candidate in 1964 running against Lyndon Johnson. He
was in the senate for many many years, had very many high level
positions involved with the senate, oversight operations of the
intelligence community, this individual was also the [?] general
in the Air Force reserves for decades.

Goldwater for years has stated that he had heard from persons
within our government whom he considered reliable that at Wright
Patterson Air Force base there was a facility commonly known as
Hanger 18, Senator Goldwater refers to it as The Blue Room, in
which Goldwater sources told him was physical evidence confirming
the existence of alien spacecraft. General, or excuse me, Senator
Goldwater in this taped segment with Larry King uh.. acknowledged
on tape for the first time that indeed he had asked every chief
of staff of the Air Force for 20 some years to gain access to the
Blue Room in that he was U.S. senator, he was a general in the
Air Force reserve.. Goldwater states in this taped interview that
every chief of staff he asked rebuffed him and he quotes a man
named general Curtis [Lamey ? (sounds like La Mey) ] in the early
60s as saying "Hell no, you cant go, I cant go, and dont ask me
again."

When the interview concludes the interviewer asks Goldwater
'Do you think our government knows that UFOs are real and are
keeping this fact from the American public?'
His response was:  "Yes."


[Local: Ping, 'stop it', ping, 'stop it']
Now what I emphasize to my audience is even though finally we
have on the public record persons of the stature of Goldwater,
the two generals I mentioned, and literally dozens of other
former high ranking military people testifying as to what
actually occurred at Roswell, it sure wasnt a weather balloon, it
wasnt a spy balloon as is the Pentagons latest version of the
events, but something quite extraordinary. This is all still
circumstantial evidence, this is not physical proof that the
object recovered at Roswell was indeed a craft from space as
Exxon has stated.

But at the very least I think one has to ask onesself why persons
of these stature ..uh..  would now come forward and make what
seem to be, on their face, rather bizarre claims. My opinion
based on what I know about the Roswell case is that indeed it
will be found in time, at some point in the future, that our
government has had in its possession absolute proof, physical
evidence, that indeed UFOs are craft from another world.
[Local whisper: Steven Speilburg might do the movie. (laugh) No,
Im serious.]

-----------------

For those of you who would like to acquire up to 600 pages
of these now unclassified documents on UFOs..

[I talk overtop of him:
      Fund for UFO Research
      P.O. Box 277
      Mt. Reiner, Maryland 20712 ]

... The fund for UFO research is a registered non-profit research
organization in the state of Maryland. This group currently sells
sets of documents, 3 sets.. 200 pages each, the funds generated
by the sales of the documents go to fund various research
projects into the UFO phenomenon. If you wish to acquire these
documents simply write to the fund and ask for their list of
publications.

Now I am not affiliated with the fund, Ive not made a nickel off
the sales of these documents, but Ive publicized this because in
my estimate this is the most direct, efficient, way for the
average person to acquire these now declassified documents.

And now a very brief conclusion.

[Local babble: ..'very brief'..]

----------
At this point in time...

[I repeated the address at this point
 overtop of Mr. Hastings statements..]

... wealth of evidence proving the existence of an official, high
level, ongoing, policy of secrecy on UFOs on the part of the U.S.
military and intelligence community. Whether or not this
deception of the public was and is justifiable, I believe, is
open to debate. The fact that it has occurred now, however, is
irrefutable. In my opinion it is simply a question of time,
whether it be tomorrow or twenty years from now, before all of
this will be officially acknowledged. Probably not only in this
country, but all over the world. And in my estimate, the best
thing that we all can do in the meantime is to set aside our
prejudices, our preconceived notions, about UFOs, our tabloid
mentality concept of what they are and are not, and begin to
consult credible sources of information as to what the U.S.
government has had to confront, in secrecy, for the past 4
decades.

In short I think we are all in for a very rude awakening.

And finally Ill say this:
 On the subject of UFOs noone has all the answers, I sure dont.
But I guarantee what you have seen and heard here tonight is far
closer to the truth than anything the U.S. government has told
you about UFOs.
