          HOW THE UNITED STATES LOST THE SECOND WORLD WAR -- RFA37

"America didn't win the war. Adolph Hitler won world war II." -- Guatemalan
president Jose Arevalo, after being replaced by dictator Jocabo Arbenz in
1951

The following is a synopsis of an extensive investigative series by David
Emory revealing a working hypothesis that during the Cold War, German
fascism and the Third Reich did not disappear as is commonly believed but
rather survived underground and achieved a very real political and economic
victory over the Allies. In the aftermath of World War I, the German Nazis
learned that anti-communism could be used to achieve strategic leverage
over Germany's prospective enemies such as Great Britain and the United
States. The Third Reich utilized this stratagem to establish Fifth Column
movements in countries they had targeted for conquest. Those movements were
composed largely of sympathizers who viewed the Third Reich as a bulwark
against communism.

The Third Reich sought to escape the full consequences of military defeat
in World War II by playing the anti-Communist card again. When it became
clear that the armies of the Third Reich were going to be defeated, it
opened secret negotiations with representatives from the Western Allies.
Representatives on both sides belonged to the transatlantic FINANCIAL and
INDUSTRIAL fraternity that had actively supported fascism... Viewed by the
Nazis as a vehicle for surviving military defeat, [this collaboration]
involved a Hitler-less Reich joining with the [international financial
cults of] U.S., Britain, France and other European nations in a
transatlantic, pan-European anti-Soviet alliance (This has apparently led
to their European Economic Community -- later known as the European
Community or E.C. -- conquest of Europe via economic manipulation rather
than through force. - Branton). The de-Nazification of Germany was aborted.
Although a few of the more obvious and obnoxious elements of Nazism were
removed, Nazis were returned to power at virtually every level and in
almost every capacity in the Federal Republic of Germany. A Hilter-less
Reich then was incorporated into the anti-Soviet alliance the Third Reich's
leaders had envisioned - NATO.

One of the central elements in RFA37, the Reinhard Gehlen spy organization,
functioned as a Trojan Horse vis-a-vis the United States. By deliberately
exaggerating Soviet intentions and capabilities in order to alarm the
United States, the Gehlen organization greatly exacerbated cold-war
tensions and manipulated them to Germany's advantage.

Perhaps the most important effect of the Gehlen organization was to
introduce "rollback" or "liberation theory" into American strategic
thinking. Rollback was a political warfare and covert operation strategy
which had its genesis in the Third Reich Ostministerium headed by Alfred
Rosenberg. This strategy entailed enlisting the aid of dissident Soviet
ethnic minorities to overthrow the Soviet Union. In return, these
minorities and their respective republics were to be granted nominal
independence while serving as satellite states of "Greater Germany."

In its American incarnation, liberation theory called for "rolling back"
communism out of Eastern Europe and the break-up of the Soviet Union into
its constituent ethnic Republics. Lip-service was given to initiating
democracy in the 'liberated' countries. Liberation theory was projected
into mainstream American political consciousness through the Crusade for
Freedom. This enormous CIA domestic media campaign not only established
liberation theory as a dominant element in American strategic thinking but
also projected European fascists associated with the Gehlen milieu into
positions of prominence within the powerful ethnic voting blocks in
America.

The Gehlen imports combined with domestic reactionary elements to form a
powerful fascistic and ultimately triumphant political engine referred to
in RFA37, as the "rollback" or "liberation milieu."

RFA37 traces the evolution of this milieu and its influence on
international and domestic political affairs. The liberation milieu
cemented its triumph in American politics through the assassination of
President Kennedy. The program highlights the roles of Gehlen-related
elements and intelligence agents associated with the PETROLEUM industry (as
in the Rockefeller-connected EXXON, ZAPATA and ATLANTIC RICHFIELD or ARCO
oil companies - Branton) in the JFK assassination. Particular emphasis is
on George Bush's connections to this milieu as well as the milieu's
relationship to the defense industry, military intelligence and CORPORATE
America.

RFA37 analyzes the Reagan and Bush administrations as the realization of
the goals of liberation theory as well as the fulfillment of National
Security Counsel #68. NSC 68 was the blueprint for U.S. strategy during the
Cold War. Heavily influenced by the work of the Gehlen organization, NSC 68
called for the destabilization of the U.S.S.R. through a massive military
buildup by the U.S. The strategy sought to bankrupt the Soviet economy
through an arms race and to promote agitation among the dissident Soviet
ethnic groups by Gehlen-related intelligence elements. In addition, the
document called for an accompanying propaganda blitz in the United States
to convince the American people to support the military buildup as well as
the suppression of political dissidents.

The Reagan and Bush administrations instituted the principles of NSC 68 and
accomplished the aims of liberation theory. The realization of those goals
also did enormous damage to the United States. The cost of bankrupting the
Soviet Union, turned the United States into the world's biggest debtor
nation, severely damaged its infrastructure and crippled its competitive
economic advantage internationally. In addition, the United States badly
compromised its democratic institutions during the Cold War, possibly
beyond repair.

RFA37 hypothesizes that the realization of liberation theory primarily
benefited GERMANY rather than the United States. Indeed, the recovery of
Germany's "lost territories" was the goal of Gehlen's alliance with the
western powers and was the raison d'etre for the Vertviebene groups.
Founded by the SS and funded by the German government, the Vertriebene
groups were part of the liberation milieu described above. (Note: Is it any
coincidence then, that the true NERVE CENTER of the European Community or
E.C. aka the 'New World Order' is GERMANY? - Branton). Their activity has
increased dramatically since the end of the Cold War. The BND, the current
German government intelligence service and the final incarnation of the
Gehlen organization, has been extremely active in the newly 'liberated'
territories where it has worked hand in glove with major German
corporations and the various Nazi parties of Germany to realize Hitler's
goal of a "greater Germany."

A REAL-LIFE "ODESSA FILE"?: Confirmation of the above seems to have come
from an anonymous individual who has released the following information --
among other revelations -- throughout the newsgroups via an anonymous news
server... The following to me is reminiscent of the theme of the movie "THE
ODESSA FILE", starring John Voight and set in 1963 West Germany:
