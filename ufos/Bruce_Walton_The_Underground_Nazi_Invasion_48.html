Similarity (4): Medical Leadership.

Physicians -- not black-clad Schutzstaffel thugs -- developed the
philosophy and methodology of the Nazi Holocaust. Almost all of the leading
German, British, and American eugenicists admired by the leaders of the
Third Reich were doctors.

The American Holocaust was initiated by Neofeminists and oppor- tunistic
politicians, but physicians soon took over the pro-abortion movement's
leadership. Warren Hern, Bill Baird, Bernard Nathanson, Henry Morgentaler,
Willard Cates, Alan Guttmacher, and many other pro-abortion strategists and
leaders were physicians.

Figure 53-4 shows the similarities between the thinking of the German and
American doctors.

The attitude that is most striking is the bare, stark utilitarianism shown
by these so-called Nazi and pro-abortion 'physicians.' Placed in a position
where they could literally dictate life or death with impunity, they soon
reverted to relying upon their own instincts for guidance in- stead of a
truly caring, God-inspired set of immutable rules.

What we must remember is that the ANTI-LIFE mentality is purely
utilitarian. Anything (or anyone) that is inconvenient or useless must be
eliminated. This viewpoint originated in Hitler's Hegelian ethic, as
described in his work Mein Kampf ; "Everything must be examined from this
[utilitarian] point of view and used or rejected according to its
utility."[31]

Once again, situation ethics reign supreme in the United States, just as
they did in Nazi Germany a half-century ago.

Similarity (5): Dehumanization of the Victim.

"Those who use this [Holocaust] analogy maintain that the pro- ponents of
freedom of choice have dehumanized the unborn child, just as the Nazis
dehumanized the Jew. This is not true."

-- 'Rabbi' Charles D. Mintz, writing for the 'Religious' Coalition for
Abortion Rights (RCAR).[4]

It is so much easier to eliminate a class of people who have first been
carefully stripped of their human dignity. This has happened so many times
that we have lost count. Yet we still refuse to learn our lessons from
history.

The same Neofeminists who call the unborn "protoplasmic rubbish," "gobbets
of meat," "parasites," and "blobs" fume about how women were historically
oppressed and 'kept down' by men who viewed them as 'weaker vessels' with
no talents other than having and raising babies.

Black 'leaders' like Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King, who refer to the
unborn as "products of conception" or "contents of the uterus," snivel
about the injustices that White men heaped on Blacks more than a century
ago, robbing them of their humanity by calling them "brutes, obscene with
animal appetites, vicious, and illegitimate," and "ignorant, perverse,
wicked, the pest of White men, agents of Satan."[32]

According to the Nazis, Jews and others not of Aryan quality "... had to be
treated like tuberculosis bacilli, with which a healthy body may become
infested. This was not cruel, if one remembers that even innocent creatures
of nature, such as hares and deer, have to be killed, so that no harm is
caused by them."[23]

Adolf Hitler, in his book Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), variously referred to
Jews as "maggots in a rotting corpse;" "a plague worse than the Black
Death;" "mankind's eternal germ of disunion;" "drones in the human hive;"
"spiders sucking blood out of the people's pores;" "a pack of rats eating
one another;" "the eternal bloodsucker;" "the vampire of peoples;" and "a
harmful bacillus that spreads," among many other degrading terms.[31]

(Note: Bringing some theological reasoning into the picture, one might
wonder just WHY the Nazis were so intent on destroying the Jews? When we
looks at this intense hatred with an objective mind, one can see that the
Jews, although humans with their own faults and weak- nesses like all the
rest of us, certainly do not deserve the hatred that anti-Semites
continually throw at them. Why is this? I believe it is due more to
spiritual or metaphysical factors rather than physical or intellectual
ones. Let's Face it, the Jews have taken a central role in the historical
drama, and are considered by many to be the 'vessel' race through whom the
Almighty has chosen to speak with his creation here on earth. There are
many who cannot accept the idea that God has bestowed on the Israelites
this grave responsibility, much less accept the "message" of the Torah or
the Bible itself. If the Initiator of all things has spoken "through" the
Jews, then in the eyes of many the Israelites would be more "accountable"
to "practice what they preach" than would the gentile nations of the world
who are the ultimate reci- pients of the wisdom from above. So jealousy,
judgementality, unbelief and even irrational hatred would have played a
major role in the past atrocities against the Jews -- especially if there
exists a dark spiritual force which has been motivating the enemies of the
Jews down through history because of the role Israel plays in the Divine
Plan. Even if one is an atheist, they would have to be incredibly naive to
fail to recognize the spiritual aspects and significance of the
'Holocaust'. The Israelites worshipped and served JEHOVAH whereas the Inner
core of the Nazi elite were involved with satanic cult worship, and
worshipped the "Lord of Darkness" Luficer, although they professed that
Lucifer and not Jehovah was the "true god". This Nazi obsession with black
witchcraft and satanism is well documented. This worship of the dark lord
via witchcraft, sorcery and the occult had existed in Bavaria from the time
that the Germanic Hun tribes -- who formed the core of the military force
of the Roman Empire -- brought black majic back from Egypt following their
occupation of northern Africa. So even if an atheist does not be- lieve in
"God" or the "Devil", they would have to admit that the BELIEF in the same
played a major role in the German - Israeli conflict of World War II. -
Wol.) Figure 53-5 shows the striking sameness of the language of de-
humanization. Acts of genocide are invariably cloaked with words of
kindness and compassion; "empty," "removal," "evacuation," and "treatment,"
to name just a few. The perpetrators, instead of being truthfully portrayed
as the killers they really are, wear the thick and nearly impenetrable
cloak of respectability, and anyone who dares question it is ruthlessly
suppressed.

On Pro-Lifers and Nazis.

"The ill-conceived 'love of neighbor' has to disappear, especially in
relation to inferior or asocial creatures. It is the supreme duty of a
national state to grant life and livelihood only to the healthy ... in
order to secure the maintenance of a hereditarily sound and racially pure
folk for all eternity. The life of an individual has meaning only in the
light of that ultimate aim, that is, in the light of his meaning to his
family and to his national state."

-- Dr. Arthur Guett, Nazi Director of Public Health. [33]

Pro-Lifers = Nazis? Pro-abortion propagandists love to compare the pro-life
movement to the Nazi movement. They do this for two reasons;

(1) to imply that pro-lifers are 'right-wing fanatics' who attempt to
deprive others of their most fundamental rights (and the most well- known
recent example is the Nazis), and

(2) to attempt to compare themselves to the most pitiful and well-known
victims of recent times; the Jews, who were experimented upon and
slaughtered like cattle, and whose bodies were stacked like cordwood by the
Nazis.

(George Orwell called this "good is evil and evil is good" mentality DOUBLE
THINK. - Wol.)

The Specific Allegations. The pro-aborts say that the Nazis banned
abortion, just like the pro-lifers want to do. They say that "Hitler and
his Nazis were anti-choice, too."

This is a catchy slogan, but, unfortunately (for the pro-aborts), it is
entirely UNTRUE.

To begin with, the German Nazi Party bore all of the characteristics of a
left-wing organization. Consider the name of the party: Nazis, which meant
Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei , or National Socialist
German Worker's Party!

Fascism is and always has been a leftist ideology. It is almost identical
to National Socialism (Nazism), whereas international Socialism is
generally referred to as Marxism. Adolf Hitler himself said on October 7,
1933 that "It is thus necessary that the individual should finally come to
realize that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the
existence of his nation, that the position of the individual ego is
conditioned solely by the interests of the nation as a whole."[34] This is
a brilliantly concise summary of "collectivism" (the German term), or
'Socialism' as it is now known.

Compare this philosophy to our latter-day attitudes, spoken in almost the
same words by world-famous Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner; "Life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are basic rights. But they are the
rights of the individual and were listed at such a time when the
literatures of freedom and dignity were concerned with the aggrandizement
of the individual. They have only a minor bearing on the survival of a
culture."[35]

The ideologies of Mussolini's Fascists dovetailed very nicely with Nazism.
In both systems, power was centralized, collective labor was promoted and
urged, and unionization was considered one of the highest goods. Under
Hitler's regime, public expenditures ballooned, and social welfare programs
proliferated. One of the primary motivating factors in the early
(pre-invasion) stages of aggressive German foreign policy was the need for
more and more support for these programs. In fact, Hitler is still admired
today by some left-wingers for his extraordinarily lavish and expensive
social programs.

The Nazis progressively exerted a greater and greater degree of control
over the people, and eventually used the fledgling German film industry to
launch an extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign directed at the
people. The primary focus of this campaign: individual rights and autonomy,
the "right to privacy" and the "freedom of choice" ( Auswahlfreiheit )
while, at the same time, these rights were actually being eroded to an
unprecedented degree.

The History of the Nazi Abortion Program.

"Once in power, the Nazis made "motherhood" into an official honor and
abortion became a symbol of degeneracy."

-- Revolutionary Communist Party of the United States.[36]

Introduction. When pro-abortionists allege that the Nazis were "anti-
choice," they are mouthing a classic half-truth. Hitler and his eugenicist
physicians banned abortion only for pureblooded Aryan women (who were a
minority within German borders at the time).

Although the Nazis banned abortion for Aryan women, they enthu- siastically
peddled and promoted abortion for non-Aryans. In fact, the Nazis mandated
legalized abortion in several European countries for the first time. They
recognized that abortion could be an extremely effective population control
tool.

This is comparable to the current United States practice of "contra-
ceptive imperialism;" pro-abortionists push very hard for funding for the
United Nations Fund for Population Assistance, which in turn helps plan and
direct the Chinese forced-abortion program. We also fund the distribution
in other countries of abortifacients like Depo-Provera, which were banned
in this country until very recently. And many of the intra-uterine devices
that killed women in the United States and were subsequently pulled off the
domestic market are now being shipped overseas in great quantities.

It is also interesting to note that pro-abortion American doctors and
medical schools have recently either removed the prohibition against
abortion from the Hippocratic Oath or have disavowed the Oath altogether.
This action, of course, is part of the necessary program of preparation for
medical horrors yet unknown to the public, including mass euthanasia,
experimentation upon newborns, and genetic manipulation on a mass scale.

The Nazis had to jettison the Oath as well, as described by Dr. Georg
August Weltz, who was responsible for the hideous Nazi "cold experiments;"
"The Hippocratic Oath ... is an honorable historical document, which,
however, does not altogether fit present times. If it is to be applied
today, the wording has to be exchanged very exten- sively, and in these
reformulations a series of new oaths have been drawn up which have only a
vague relationship to the ancient Hippo- cratic Oath ... a [theory of]
medicine based on the principle of nil nocere [first, do no harm] is a very
impoverished medicine, and we are unfortunately not in a position to carry
on medicine on that simple principle today."[37]

In summary, pro-abortionists calling pro-lifers "Nazis" are engaging in
classic transference; they are labeling their opposition with the very
qualities that they detest in themselves. The mechanisms and mani-
festations of the transference tactic are described in Chapter 13 of Volume
I.

The following paragraphs trace the history of the German abortion program.

The Planning Begins. Nazi physicians, ethicists, and planners had been
greatly influenced by the thinking of American eugenicists, as described
previously in this chapter. The Hegelian (utilitarian) "ethic" held by the
eugenicists deemed that there was such a thing as human life not worth
living. Once this initial assumption had been made, of course, the
definition of "unworthy" inevitably expanded to suit the needs of those in
power at the time.

This type of thinking dovetailed nicely with Hitler's developing
philosophy. In his 1924 book Main Kampf , he wrote that the government had
seven chief responsibilities. One of these was "... to maintain the
practice of modern birth control. No dis- eased or weak person should be
allowed to have children."[31]

As early as the Summer of 1932, the leaders of the Nazi Party met in Munich
to discuss population policy as it would be applied to non-Aryan peoples.
Demographic and agricultural experts warned that the "tremendous biological
fertility" of the Eastern European regions must be dealt with by the
implementation of a rigidly-enforced depopulation policy (whose elements
remarkably resemble the current coercive Chinese population program
described in Chapter 50).

Hitler, who personally attended at this conference, warned that "What we
have discussed here must remain confidential."[38]

In 1933, the compulsory sterilization law for the mentally handi- capped
and crippled went into effect. On October 8, 1935, the

Erbgesundheitgesetz -- "hereditary health laws" -- were promulgated. One of
these laws legalized abortion for "just the hard cases" -- rape, incest,
and if either parent had a hereditary disease that might lead to
deformation of the fetus.[39]

Hitler's Personal Views On Abortion. Over and over again, pro- abortionists
tell us that Adolf Hitler enacted restrictive laws for "the protection of
motherhood." This is absolutely true -- but only for Aryan motherhood. Once
again, the pro-abortion liars are only telling a small portion of the
story.

Adolf Hitler, were he living today, would make a superb pro-abortion
propagandist. His views exactly paralleled those of the modern-day
abortionists, who have tried hard to exterminate the Black race ever since
Margaret Sanger's early birth control programs.

Hitler believed that rights only belong to those strong enough to defend
them -- just as American pro-abortionists do. He insisted in Mein Kampf
that the weak or small had "no inalienable right to life" ( Lebensrecht )
-- just as American pro- abortionists do.[31] Those physicians who dared
resist Hitler's program of abortion on demand for women of unfit race were
labeled "reactionary" and "enemies of women" (miso- gynists) while those
who supported the program were called "sensible" and "friends of women" --
the identical words used by American pro- abortionists today.[40]

Poland's Martyrdom. The German Blitzkrieg ("lightning war") swept into
Eastern European countries in 1939. The Nazi eugenicists and population
planners were not far behind the tanks.

After the 1939 invasion of Poland, the "Reich Commission for Strengthening
of Germandom" (RKFDV), an SS ( Schutzstaffel ) organization, issued the
following policy statement on Nov- ember 25; "All measures which have the
tendency to limit the births are to be tolerated or to be supported.
Abortion in the remaining area of Poland must be declared free from
punishment. The means for abortion and contraceptive means may be offered
publicly without police restriction. Homosexuality is always to be declared
legal. The institutions and persons involved professionally in abortion
practices are not to be interfered with by police."[41]

Until this time, abortion had been illegal in Poland. The Nazis introduced
"safe and legal abortion" for the first time -- for the specific purpose of
limiting the future Polish population. It is absolutely fasci- nating to
note that the key slogan of this program was "Freedom of Choice!" (
Auswahlfreiheit ).

The German Ministry of the Interior reviewed and approved of this program
in May 27, 1941, and, on October 19 of the same year, the Polish population
program was put into action. Hitler's July 23 decree, described below,
extended the identical policy of "contraceptives and abortion on demand" to
the other parts of Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe.[42]
