NEW JERSEY IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Mike Klein June 8, 1995 202/544-7636
SCOTCH PLAINS, NJ -- Calling Tuesday's stunning victory by write-in
Assembly Candidates Geri Samuel and John Salerno "a victory of con- science
and a repudiation of blind hatred", leaders of the National Jewish
Democratic Council hailed the defeat of self proclaimed Holocaust
revisionist John Kucek in yesterday's Democratic primary for the State
Assembly here. Unofficial returns, with 90 percent of precincts counted had
Samuel with 1853 votes, Salerno with 1803, and Kucek, the only candidate
whose name appeared on the Democratic ballot with 326. With their primary
victory Samuel and Salerno qualified to face incumbent Republicans Alan
Augustine and Bridget Bagger. "The magnitude of this win speaks volumes
about the Democratic voters of the 22nd Assembly District," said David
Steiner of Roseland, who is the NJDC's National Vice Chair. "It was a
victory over hatred, a triumph over indifference, and it sends a clear
message that Democratic voters will not tolerate a bigot running under our
party's standard." Members of the National Jewish Democratic Council took
an active role in the Samuel-Salerno campaign, mobilizing volunteers and
helping to secure adequate financial support. NJDC volunteers were
particularly active in staffing telephone banks that reminded voters of the
necessity of casting write-in ballots. Tuesday's result was the second
consecutive defeat for Kucek in his effort to secure a Democratic
nomination. In the 11th Congressional District pri- mary in 1994, former
State Senator Frank Herbert defeated Kucek by a two to one margin after
mounting a write-in campaign. In both cases, Kucek was the only candidate
to file in the Democratic primary. Kucek also ran for the U.S. Senate in
1990 under the banner of the Populist Party, which sponsored NEO-NAZI DAVID
DUKE'S presidential campaign in NEW JERSEY in 1988. Said Steiner, "we
certainly hope that the voters of the 22nd District have written John
Kucek's political obituary." * * * * * * *

Population control, Nazis, and the U.N!

by Anton Chaitkin
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ROCKFELLER AND MASS MURDER

The ROCKEFELLER Foundation is the PRIME SPONSER of public
relations for the UNITED NATION'S drastic depopulation program, which
the world is invited to accept at the UN's scheduled September conference
in Cairo, Egypt.

Evidence in the possession of a growing number of researchers in America,
England, and Germany demonstrates that the Foundation and its CORP-
ORATE, MEDICAL, and POLITICAL associates organized the racial MASS
MURDER program of NAZI GERMANY.

These globalists, who function as a conduit for British Empire geopolitics,
were NOT stopped after World War II.  The UNITED NATIONS alliance of
the old NAZI rightwing with the NEW AGE leftwing poses an even graver
danger to the world today than the same grouping did in 1941.

Oil monopolist John D.  Rockefeller created the family-run Rockefeller
Foundation in 1909.  By 1929 he had placed $300 million worth of the
family's controlling interest in the Standard Oil Company of NEW JERSEY
(later called ``EXXON') to the account of the Foundation.

The Foundation's money created the medical specialty known as PSY-
CHIATRIC GENETICS.  For the new experimental field, the Foundation
reorganized medical teaching in Germany, creating and thenceforth con-
tinuously directing the ``Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry'' and the
``Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity.''
The Rockefellers' chief executive of these institutions was the fascist Swiss
psychiatrist Ernst Rudin, assisted by his proteges Otmar Verschuer and
Franz J. Kallmann.

In 1932, the British-led ``Eugenics'' movement designated the Rockefellers'
Dr. Rudin as the president of the worldwide Eugenics Federation.  The
movement called for the killing or sterilization of people whose heredity
made them a public burden.

-- The Racial Laws --

A few months later, Hitler took over Germany and the Rockefeller-Rudin
apparatus became a section of the Nazi state.  The regime appointed
Rudin head of the Racial Hygiene Society.  Rudin and his staff, as part
of the Task Force of Heredity Experts chaired by SS chief Heinrich
Himmler, drew up the sterilization law.  Described as an American Model
law, it was adopted in July 1933 and proudly printed in the September
1933 Eugenical News (USA) with Hitler's signature.  The Rockefeller
group drew up other race laws, also based on existing Virginia statutes.
(Note: Virginia played a central role in the attempt to rally other states
to succeed from the Union during the Civil War, with a great deal of help
from the Knights of the Golden Circle -- a secret society with connections
to the Jesuits, the Bavarian Illuminati and the British Rothschild masons.
Researcher Dennis Passero, a Catholic and anti-Jesuit expositor of secret
society abuses, quoted several early authorities to the effect that the KGC
and their European sponsors wanted the Union split because our economic
independence had become a grave threat to the high financial powers of
Europe that wanted to keep the world, including all Americans, financially
subservient to them -- as the American Oil Companies who have ties to the
European Illuminists have succeeded in keeping Americans dependent on
them.  The Knights of the Golden Circle and their European backers financed
and planned the successionist movement, and even placed their symbol --
the "eye in the triangle" -- on the first version of the "Rebel" flag.  This does
not mean that Virginians or other state successionist collaborators were
anti-American per se.  The real traitors were the secret society represen-
tatives who had infiltrated the politics of the South, AS WELL AS the North.
Passero also quotes from Burke McCarty who exposed the KGC connec-
tions to John Wilkes Booth -- the man who assassinated President Abraham
Lincoln, and to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan.  We should never forget
that nearly a half a million Americans were killed during the course of the
Civil War. - Wol.)  Otmar Verschuer and his assistant Josef Mengele together
wrote reports for special courts which enforced Rudin's racial purity law against
cohabitation of Aryans and non-Aryans.

The ``T4'' unit of the Hitler Chancery, based on psychiatrists led by Rudin
and his staff, cooperated in creating propaganda films to sell mercy killing
(euthanasia) to German citizens. The public reacted antagonistically:  Hitler
had to withdraw a tear-jerker right-to-die film from the movie theaters.  The
proper groundwork had not yet been laid.

Under the Nazis, the German chemical company I.G.  FARBEN and
Rockefeller's STANDARD [EXXON] OIL of New Jersey were effectively a
SINGLE FIRM, merged in hundreds of cartel arrangements.  I.G. FARBEN
was led up until 1937 by the Warburg family, Rockefeller's partner in banking
and in the design of Nazi German eugenics.

Following the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Standard Oil pledged to
keep the merger with I.G. Farben going even if the U.S. entered the war.
This was exposed in 1942 by Sen. Harry Truman's investigating committee,
and President Roosevelt took hundreds of legal measures during the war
to stop the Standard - I.G. Farben cartel from supplying the enemy war
machine.

In 1940-41, I.G. Farben built a gigantic factory at Auschwitz in Poland,
to utilize the Standard Oil / I.G. Farben patents with concentration camp
slave labor to make gasoline from coal.  The SS was assigned to guard
the Jewish and other inmates and select for killing those who were unfit
for I.G. Farben slave labor.  Standard-Germany president Emil Helfferich
testified after the war that Standard Oil funds helped pay for SS guards
at Auschwitz.

In 1940, six months after the notorious Standard-I.G. meeting, European
Rockefeller Foundation official Daniel O'Brian wrote to the Foundation's
chief medical officer Alan Gregg that ``it would be unfortunate if it was
chosen to stop research which has no relation to war issues'' -- so the
Foundation continued financing Nazi ``psychiatric research'' (which
translates into "mind control" research. - Wol.) during the war.

In 1936, Rockefeller's Dr. Franz Kallmann interrupted his study of
hereditary degeneracy and emigrated to America because he was
half-Jewish.  Kallmann went to New York and established the Medical
Genetics Department of the New York State Psychiatric Institute.  The
SCOTTISH RITE of Freemasonry published Kallman's study of over
1,000 cases of schizophrenia, which tried to prove its hereditary basis.
In the book, Kallmann thanked his long-time boss and mentor Rudin.

Kallmann's book,  published  in  1938  in  the  USA  and  Nazi  Germany,
was used by the T4 unit as a rationalization to begin in 1939 the murder
of  mental patients and various ``defective'' people, perhaps most of them
CHILDREN.  Gas and lethal injections were used  to  kill  250,000  under
this program, in which the staffs for a BROADER murder program were de-
sensitized and trained.

- Dr. Mengele... -

In 1943, Otmar Verschuer's assistant Josef Mengele was made medical
commandant of Auschwitz.  As wartime director of Rockefeller's Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity in Berlin,
Verschuer secured funds for Mengele's experiments at Auschwitz from the
German Research Council. Verschuer wrote a progress report to the Council:
``My co-researcher in this research is my assistant the anthropologist and
physician Mengele.  He is serving as Hauptstuermfuehrer and camp doctor
in the concentration camp Auschwitz....  With the permission of the Reichs-
fuehrer SS Himmler, anthropological research is being undertaken on the
various racial groups in the concentration camps and blood samples will be
sent to my laboratory for investigation.''

Mengele prowled the railroad lines leading into Auschwitz, looking for twins
-- a favorite subject of psychiatric geneticists.  On arrival at Mengele's
experimental station, twins filled out ``a detailed questionnaire from the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.''  There were daily drawings of blood for Verschuer's
``specific protein'' research. Needles were injected into eyes for work on
eye color.  There were experimental blood transfusions and infections.
Organs and limbs were removed, sometimes without anesthetics.  Sex
changes were attempted. Females were sterilized, males were castrated.
Thousands were murdered and their organs, eyeballs, heads, and limbs
were sent to Verschuer and the Rockefeller group at the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute.

In 1946,  Verschuer  wrote  to the Bureau of Human Heredity in London,
asking for help in continuing his ``scientific research.''

- Facelift -

In 1947, the Bureau of Human Heredity moved from London to Copenhagen.
The new Danish building for this was built with Rockefeller money.  The
first International Congress in Human Genetics following World War II was
held at this Danish institute in 1956.  By that time, Verschuer was a member
of the American Eugenics Society, then indistingishable from Rockefeller's
Population Council.

Dr. Kallmann helped save Verschuer by testifying in his de-nazification
proceedings.  Dr. Kallmann created the American Society of Human Genetics,
which organized the ``Human Genome Project'' -- (based at Los Alamos Labs
and, some claim, also at their underground facility near Dulce, New Mexico
where advanced genetic engineering research has been underway for decades.
- Wol.) a current $3 billion physical multiculturalism effort.  Kallmann was a
director of the American Eugenics Society in 1952 and from 1954 to 1965.

In the 1950s, the Rockefellers reorganized the U.S.  eugenics movement
in their own family offices, with spinoff population-control and abortion groups
The Eugenics Society changed its name to the "Society for the Study of
Social Biology", its current name.

The Rockefeller Foundation  had  long  financed  the  eugenics  movement
in  England,  apparently repaying Britain for the fact that British capital and
an Englishman - partner  had  started  old  John  D.  Rockefeller out in his
Oil Trust.  In the 1960s,  the Eugenics Society of England adopted what
they called Crypto-eugenics, stating in their official reports that they would
do eugenics  through  means and  instruments not labeled as eugenics.

With support  from  the  Rockefellers,  the  Eugenics  Society  (England)
set up a  sub-committee  called  the  International  Planned  Parenthood
Federation,  which  for 12 years had no other address than the Eugenics
Society.

This, then,  is the private, international apparatus which has set the world
up for a global holocaust, under the UN flag.
