'COSMIC TOP SECRETS' AND THE DULCE BASE





The Sept. 10, 1990 issue of 'UFO UNIVERSE' related the following under the
title-heading, "WILLIAM F. HAMILTON III -- UFOLOGY'S 'MYSTERY MAN' TO
REVEAL 'COSMIC TOP SECRETS'":



"Until just recently, William F. Hamilton III managed to keep up a
relatively low profile so that he can continue his work in private and
without needless interruption from well-meaning, and never-the-less prying
eyes.

"Admittedly, his name is not known in every household, but the fact of the
matter is that 'Bill' is highly respected among his peers.

"Indeed, what he has to say is as important and vital as the words of
flying ace John Lear and former Navy intelligence officer William Cooper,
who have gone on record regarding the alien conspiracy.

"In fact, much of what Hamilton maintains is consistent with the theory
that there is a massive government cover-up on UFOs and alien visitations
that reaches right up to the president's private office door, and that the
U.S. military has made a secret pact with a group of aliens known as the
'Greys'. [They] are on earth... mutilating cattle, and abducting humans for
experimental purposes. Supposedly the Greys have TAKEN OVER several
Top-Secret underground military facilities, AND certain branches of the
government [who] are working hand-in-hand with these entities to bring
about total domination of the world, while a SECOND group of
extra-terrestrials is here trying to protect us...

"Of a highly controversial nature, many of Hamilton's statements may seem
overly 'radical' to even his closest associates, not to mention other
investigators who refuse to even seriously consider the documentation he is
able to present to bolster his case.

"...About ten years ago, a few scientists and engineers, who worked for
NASA and shared an interest in UFO abductions, came together to form a
group they called Project VISIT -- Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative
Team. They studied about 130 cases of UFO abductions with the goal of
constructing a model of UFOs, their operation, and the entities who crew
UFOs.

"They found:

"-- UFOs have bright interior lighting.

"-- Abductees undergo a medical-type examination with apparently highly
sophisticated equipment.

"-- Burns are suffered by many abductees.

"-- Time loss - from 20 minutes to 3 hours - is common. Project VISIT
member, Dr. Richard Niemtzow, described the crew members as four feet tall,
hairless, grey in color, with no nose, a small mouth and large slanted
eyes. The Grey humanoid is emotionless and communicates by telepathy.

"The Greys have earned a reputation quite different than the Nordic blondes
and other reported species. Most of the abductions are done by greys and
more than one variation of Grey. The Greys do most of the biological
intervening on abductees. Tans, Whites, and Blues (i.e. 'Greys' of other
skin colors, gray-tan, gray-white, gray-blue, etc. - Branton) have also
been reported by abductees. I have personally had some sort of encounter
with what I call the Whites. They are small with extremely white skin and
black, wrap-around eyes.

"EARTH MADE SAUCERS -- In April, 1984, Lt. General George Bone, Vice
Commander of the U.S. Air Force Systems Command was killed while test
flying a secret aircraft over the Groom Lake area, a top secret facility
located about 100 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility is
designated 'Area 51.' The Systems Command reputedly uses this facility to
test-fly spy planes, such as the SR-71 Blackbird or its successor, the
Aurora. According to the February, 1988 issue of GUNG-HO magazine which ran
a feature article on Area 51, some of the craft being flown out of that
test facility would make George Lucas drool!...

"In the early 1980s a radio technician working at Area 51 reported seeing a
saucer on the ground. It was some 20 or 30 feet in diameter, he said, and
when it flew, it moved silently through the air. The technician also viewed
a number of wooden shipping crates marked 'Project Redlight.' That project
may have been a forerunner of Snowbird. Presently, the Air Force is trying
to acquire 89.000 acres adjacent to the Groom Lake facility and to place
the nearby Groom Mountains off-limits to the public.

"Before and after the TV documentary 'UFO COVER-UP LIVE', there had been
talk of an underground alien base located in the vicinity of the Groom Lake
test site, known as 'Dreamland'... This adds a whole new dimension to the
idea of a secret space program and hints at fantastic secret programs that
take [us] more than one step beyond.

"A friend of mine once moved to Riverton, Wyoming to escape from terrifying
mysteries he encountered in NEW MEXICO. He said the locals at Riverton
asked him, 'Are you here to work on the secret space project out at the jet
airport?' Saucers were seen close to the ground in Riverton. One day my
friend's truck broke down and he had to hitch a ride to town. A black
Lincoln pulled up and a man dressed in black gave him a lift. The dashboard
looked like a computer console. The MIB knew exactly where he wanted to be
left off in front of the post office, but my friend had never told him.

"ALIEN IMPLANTS -- In 1980 when I lived in Glendale, Arizona, I received a
call from my friend Walter Baumgartner, who published a magazine of limited
circulation called ENERGY UNLIMITED. Walter was a natural technologist. He
said that he had started working for a physicist by the name of PAUL
BENNEWITZ at Thunder Scientific Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He then
proceeded to tell me the fantastic story that Mr. Bennewitz had succeeded
in communicating with aliens at an underground base situated near MT.
ARCHULETA in the town of DULCE that was close to the Colorado border and
situated on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation. (Note: Bennewitz
actually stated that he 'interrogated' the alien-collective via a
computer-radio-video link with an 'alien' computer terminal, by tapping-in
to the aliens' ship-to-base communications frequency and using a type of
hexedecimal mathematical code to break the alien encryption. He first
discovered the signals using specialized equipment he had developed, and
later concluded that these signals were also being used to influence
abductees who had been given electronic mind-control implants. - Branton).

"He told me that these little grey aliens were abducting and implanting
people with a device inserted at the base of the skull for the purpose of
monitoring and CONTROLLING humans. He said that the 'government' knew about
this and was involved with alien activities. He also stated that the aliens
feared our nuclear weapons and nuclear radiation. He told me that Paul was
working on a weapon that would be effective against these aliens.

(INTERJECTION BY BRANTON REGARDING 'MIND CONTROL' IMPLANTS: I know of a
person who went to have some implants removed by doctors. The implants were
removed, via the nasal cavity, from the nerve centers of the brain -- some
of her nerves being damaged in the process. This nerve damage resulted in a
near-death experience following which, when she had 'awakened', she felt
like a 'new person' or that some other 'identity' that had been operating
in her was now gone. Some mystics may refer to alien intelligence's that
possess human minds as 'walk-ins'. What many refer to as 'walk-ins' are
often artificial intelligence matrix implants which are attached to the
nerve centers of the human brain. These serve as 'nodes' for an alien
collective in a parasite-host capacity, allowing the aliens to physically
utilize the human subject after an altered state of consciousness has been
induced, and the human subject's individual consciousness is incapacitated.
This transfer to the 'alternate consciousness' often occurs at night. Also,
both malevolent and 'relatively' benevolent other-worldly cultures often
induce within human subjects one or more 'alternate' personalities which
are taught or programmed to work and operate in the 'other' realm. If the
individual is left-brain dominant and right-handed in their 'conscious'
life, in the 'alternate' life they may be right-brain dominant and
left-handed, as is the case with my own elusive alternate identity. Other
than saying that humans have one brain with two hemispheres, it would be
just as legitimate to say that we have two brains in one cranium. In many
cases where more 'benevolent' humanoids are concerned, the individual may
have 'flashes' of memories of a 'double' or 'alternate' existence where
they interact with exterran, subterran or even other-dimensional humanoid
societies, often in an 'intimate' capacity, and in some cases even serve as
starship crew members or pilots. In the case of the benevolent
'non-interventionists', such an alternate personality may be a means of
interacting with Terrans without violating the laws of non-intervention and
interfering with an earth-persons 'conscious' life, although I myself would
suggest that even this would be stretching 'non-interventionism' to the
limit. However in the case of the malevolents, such alternate 'identities'
are programmed through intense mind-control techniques with the intent of
producing unconscious mind-slaves for the alien collective. The 'secrecy'
and fear of the exposure of their interventionist agendas is in this case
the motive for maintaining secrecy. What is especially confusing however is
when one, as in my own personal case, has been infused with alternate
personalities or identities by BOTH benevolent AND malevolent other-worldly
cultures. In my personal case this involved being patched-in to an alien
collective-mind [Ashtar] via implants and 'used' by the dark side of that
collective -- or the interventionist elements within the Ashtar collective
such as the 'Orionite infiltrators' that some contactees have spoken of who
desire to use their positions to establish absolute control -- only to
later have this or another alternate personality matrix 're-programmed' by
a more benevolent faction of the 'alliance'. This more benevolent faction
would either be involved with a separate Federation, or it would be a
faction that is part of the 'collective' itself yet which is involved in an
ongoing conflict with its 'darker' side, a faction which is opposed to the
interventionist-control agendas if the 'infiltrators'. One cannot
comprehend the significance of the psychic battles that can rage through a
single human mind until one has been caught in the crossfire between two
OPPOSING 'alternate personalities' -- one of which is an individualist and
one of which is a collectivist -- that are slugging it out for dominance of
ones unconscious existence. The best one can do in such an event would be
to try and retrieve as many suppressed memories as they are able, sort the
whole mess out, and assimilate and take conscious control of those thought
patterns that will be most beneficial to them and eliminate the harmful
thought-patterns. I will not deceive you, such a process can be very
painful at times. After all, it is the ROOT "individual consciousness" of a
human being which has the final say as to just WHO that person is going to
be, based on the universal law of free agency. For those of you who are
reading this and who feel that they may have been 'programmed' with an
alternate 'alien' personality which is activated during alien encounters, I
will say for an absolute fact that according to universal law this
collectivist alternate personality MUST submit to the demands of your
conscious will. Anything else would be a direct violation of the
non-intervention laws. Even without the assistance of alien
psycho-technology, certain psychiatrists are fully aware of how easy it is
to hypnotically induce an alternate personality within a human being, IF
they had access to the suppressed mind-control techniques that have been
used by certain intelligence agencies and occult fraternities. - Branton)

"UNDERGROUND BASES -- On April 1 and 2, I spent 24 hours visiting with John
Lear at his home in Las Vegas. He took out a stack of papers and had me
peruse them at my leisure. His study room had walls covered with aircraft
photos and certificates. There was no doubt in my mind that John loved
flying. John is a soft spoken individual and frequently, while visiting
him, I have watched him putter in the garden. We discussed Area 51. John
had some long distance photos of the Groom Lake facility. The one thing
that stood out in one photo was the radio telescope pointing straight up in
the midst of a group of buildings. The scope was probably tracking any
overhead spy satellites. He showed me the reference in the February, 1988
issue of GUNG-HO magazine, that [insisted] that spacecraft were being
test-flown from this facility. John heard rumors that the Greys had a base
under the Groom Mountains. This is the one we believe is called DREAMLAND.
One of my sources [a leak] says DREAM is an acronym that stands for Data
Repository Establishment And Maintenance. John told me the story of Mr. K,
whose son Robert was trapped inside a joint human-alien underground base in
Utah. This Robert had apparently worked at DULCE BASE at one time. MR. K
felt like he was being given the run-around by the military in his attempts
to locate his son...

"I learned that there were a few technical people who worked at Sandia Labs
in Albuquerque who were interested in alien activity. One man I talked to,
C.R., knew a mysterious Colonel Ronald Blackburn, who was reputed to have
said that there were 600 aliens at the Groom Lake facility in Nevada. C.R.
had investigated a UFO crash near Gallup, N.M. in 1983. This one was also
investigated by Tommy Roy Blann. I heard of Colonel Edwards at Albuquerque
who knew the AFOSI agent Richard Doty (BOTH of whom worked with Paul
Bennewitz in his investigations of the alien activity taking place at the
Dulce Base. - Branton). Doty had talked to some investigators about the
government cover-up. Why? I don't know.

"WEIRD HAPPENINGS AT DULCE -- On April 19, 1988, my wife and I arrived at
Dulce, N.M. at about 4:30 p.m. Dulce was a beautiful little mountain town
sitting at an elevation exceeding 7,500 feet. There was still snow on the
ground by the Best Western Motel. I checked into the motel and called Gabe
Valdez. He came over to see me about 9:30 p.m. We talked about UFOs and the
cattle mutilations. He said that he had not seen any mutes since 1981-82.
[I] had him read a letter written by Richard Doty in which Doty denies all
involvement with UFO secrecy. He said Doty wasn't telling the truth. This
proved true, because Doty started talking again.

"He told me that Doty wrote a report that stated that Paul Bennewitz was
being investigated. Later Gabe offered us a ride around Dulce. He took us
in his patrol car and showed us some of the routes. He said he saw glowing
orange-lighted airships flying silently around the area frequently. He
never saw these airships in daylight. We took a look at the Gomez Ranch,
site of some of the mutes that took place in 1978. We asked about
Bennewitz's belief that there was a secret underground alien base in the
area. He said he believed about 80 percent of what Bennewitz said
concerning alien activities in the area... he definitely seemed to think
there was a base in the area, but his idea of where it is located was
different than Paul's. He thought that the base might be south of Dulce,
closer to the Gomez Ranch. He said he had not found any entries to the
base. He had found landing tracks and crawler marks near the site of the
mutes. He invited me to come back sometime and climb Mt. Archuleta. Someday
I would come back to Dulce, but I had no idea when...

"A lot started happening in October, 1988. I started investigating the case
of a couple who had gone up to a plateau on the south side of the Tehachapi
Mountains (outside of Edwards AFB. - Branton) not far from my house. At two
in the morning they witnessed a large flashing orb come up from the ground
and rise slowly into the sky. They experienced about two hours of missing
time. Under hypnosis performed by a local hypnotherapist who had taken an
interest in UFO abductees, we had found that the man recalled having been
taken to an underground facility. He kept mentioning 'the Colonel!'..."
