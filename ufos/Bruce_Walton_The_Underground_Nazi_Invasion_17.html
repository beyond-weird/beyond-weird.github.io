 [PART 17]

ADMIRAL BYRD AND OPERATION HIGHJUMP

...In 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 military troops from the U.S., 
Britain and Australia in an invasion of Antarctica (Operation Highjump and 
follow-up), but encountered heavy resistance from Nazi 'flying saucers' and 
had to call off the invasion. A Rear-Admiral who was in that invasion has 
retired in Texas, and said he was shocked when he read the *Fire From The 
Sky* material. He knew there were a lot of aircraft and rocket shoot-downs 
but did not realize the situation was so bad.

The invasion of ANTARCTICA consisted of three battle groups from Norfolk,
VA, on Dec. 2, 1946. They were led by Byrd's command ship, the ice-breaker
*Northwind,* and consisted of the catapult ship *Pine Island,* the destroyer 
*Brownsen,* the aircraft-carrier *Phillipines Sea,* the U.S. submarine *Sennet,*
two support vessels *Yankee* and *Merrick,* and two tankers *Canisted* and 
*Capacan,* the destroyer *Henderson* and a floatplane ship *Currituck.* A 
British-Norwegian force and a Russian force, and I believe some Australian 
and Canadian forces were also involved.

On March 5, 1947 the *El Mercurio* newspaper of Santiago, Chile, had a 
headline article "On Board the Mount Olympus on the High Seas" which 
quoted Byrd in an interview with Lee van Atta: "Adm. Byrd declared today 
that it was imperative for the United States to initiate immediate defence 
measures against hostile regions. The admiral further stated that he didn't 
want to frighten anyone unduly but that it was a bitter reality that in case of 
a new war the continental United States would be attacked by flying objects
which could fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds. (Earlier he had recom-
mended defence bases at the NORTH Pole.) Admiral Byrd repeated the above 
points of view, resulting from his personal knowledge gathered both at the 
north and south poles, before a news conference held for International News 
Service."

(Note: Just as there have been claims of "warm" land in Antarctica which
the Nazis may have taken advantage of, there have historically existed leg-
ends of other "lost lands" or valleys in the northern extremities.  For instance,
one legend is spoken of in the Apocryphal book of II Esdras, chapter 13.  This
is a book of non-canonical Jewish legends and such which were gathered
during the 400-year "period of silence" which existed between the closing of
the Old Testament [Torah] and the New Testament records.  This apocryphal
work, although not considered to contain "infallible and divinely inspired"
revelation, does give an interesting passage on the possible whereabouts 
of the 9 1/2 "lost" tribes of Israel.  In Israel, three-and-a-half tribes have been
documented: Judah, Benjamin, the black Dannite tribes of Ethiopia, and
half of the tribe of Levi.  No-one has been able as of this writing to document
any known culture as having direct decent from the other "lost" tribes [including
the two half-Josephite-tribes of Ephraim and Mannassah which are considered
to be distinct tribes of their own].  The II Esdras account tells of the lost tribes
being taken into Assyria and beyond.  However, not wishing to be tempted by
the practices of the pagan tribes who surrounded them, they chose to proceed
northward beyond the river Sambatyon -- which miraculously parted for them.
But there they were not content, and by divine leading they disappeared into
the far NORTH into a land called "Arzareth" where "never men dwelt", and from 
whence according to the legend they will one day return in power and glory.  
There are other accounts of strange geothermally-warmed lands beyond a "great 
ice barrier" in the far north situated in a polar concavity similar to that at the top
of an apple or an orange, yet hidden from human view by a perpetual cloud-
cover or mist created by the interaction of warm and cold air.  Whether these
legends are true or not, or in fact whether the Apocryphal legend is true or not,
one should realize that the polar areas HAVE always held a sense of fascina-
tion in the minds of many of the nations on earth... possibly because of the fact
that they still remained very much a 'mystery'.  The Nazi's sent out numerous
polar expeditions, which were justified largely by the Germanic legends of a 
lost polar country called "Ultima Thule" which was supposedly inhabited by 
an ancient Aryan super-race.  From these legends the very superstitious and
occult-oriented Nazi leaders established the "Thule" society and other inter-
connected cults which provided the major motivating force for the racist Nazi 
ideologies, and their tragic outgrowth. - Wol.)

When Byrd returned to the States, he was hospitalized and was not allowed
to hold any more press conferences. In March 1955, he was placed in charge
of Operation Deepfreeze which was part of the International Geophysical
Year (1957-1958) exploration of the Antarctic. He died, some have suggested
he was murdered, in 1957...

UFO researchers are also aware of strange sightings of 'flying saucers' with
swastikas or iron crosses on them, "aliens" speaking German, etc. An
example is the American Reinhold Schmidt -- whose father was born in Germ-
any -- who tells in his book *Incident At Kearney* (Nebraska) that he was taken 
on a 'flying saucer' on several occasions. He said the crew spoke German 
and acted like German soldiers. He said they took him to the Polar region (if
someone were making up a story, why would they claim to be taken, of all
places, to the pole?)

After returning he was subjected to persecution by the U.S. Government. His
description [of the aerial discs] matched pictures captured from the Germans. 
(Note: For video's detailing an in-depth historical analysis of the Nazi cults,
numerous details on the Nazi aerial disc projects, AS WELL AS actual photo-
footage retrieved from classified sources of these aerial discs in operation, and 
also investigations into the "New Berlin" base below Neu Schwabenland, Ant-
arctica -- contact: Vladimir Terziski, President, - American Academy of Dissident 
Sciences, 10970 Ashton Ave. #310, Los Angeles, CA  90024, phone and fax: 
USA-(310)-473-9717. - Wol.)  In 1959, three large newspapers in Chile reported 
front page articles about UFO encounters where the crew members appeared 
to be German soldiers. IN the 1960s there were reports in New York and NEW 
JERSEY of flying saucer "aliens" who spoke German, or English with a German 
accent.

In the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg atomic espionage trials, they spoke of
"warships of space." Since they had access to top secret information, about
what were they talking?


HITLER ESCAPED!

I remember hearing, in the 1950s, rumors that Hitler had escaped to a
secret Nazi base at the South Pole. In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower said:
"We have been unable to unearth one bit of tangible evidence of Hitler's
death. Many people believe that Hitler escaped from Berlin."

When President Truman asked Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam conference
in 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, "No." Stalin's
top army officer, Marshall Gregory Zhukov, whose troops were the ones to
occupy Berlin, flatly stated after a long thorough investigation in 1945: "We
have found no corpse that could be Hitler's."

(NOTE:  In regards to the USSR, few even realize that Stalin was responsible
for the murder of nearly 6 million Jews IN the Soviet Union during the course
of World War II.  Hitler killed nearly 10 million -- 6 million in the concentration
camps and 4 million outside of the camps or in battle.  So the total of dead
Israelis may have been more in the range of 16 million during the course of
World War II.  The exact number is still being disputed even today.  However,
an important thing to remember is that Vladimir Lenin, the Communist revo-
lutionary who led the Rockefeller-backed Bolshevik attack against Tzarist
Russia, WAS HIMSELF AN AGENT OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT 
who was sent into Russia from Germany via train to carry lead the Bavarian/
German backed Communist revolution.  So then, who REALLY works for 
whom? - Wol.)

The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremburg, Thomas J. Dodd, said:
"No one can say he is dead." Major General Floyd Parks, who was com-
manding general of the U.S. sector in Berlin, stated for publication that he
had been present when Marshall Zhukov described his entrance to Berlin,
and Zhukov stated he believed Hitler might have escaped. Lt. Gen. Bedell
Smith, Chief of Staff to Gen. Eisenhower in the European invasion and later
Director of the CIA, stated publicly on Oct. 12, 1945, "No human being can
say conclusively that Hitler is dead."

Col. W.J. Heimlich, former Chief, United States Intelligence, at Berlin,
stated for publication that he was in charge of determining what had hap-
pened to Hitler and after a thorough investigation his report was: "There
was no evidence beyond that of HEARSAY to support the THEORY of
Hitler's suicide." He also stated, "On the basis of present evidence, no
insurance company in America would pay a claim on Adolph Hitler."

Nuremburg judge Michael Mussmanno said in his book *Ten Days to Die,*
"Russia must accept much of the blame (to the extent that it still exists)
that Hitler did not die in May 1945." However, Mussmanno STATED that he
interviewed Hitler's personal waiter, his valet, his chauffeur, his two secret-
aries, pilots, top generals, etc., and they all 'agreed' perfectly that Hitler
committed suicide. He said they could not have gotten together afterward
and made up a story that agreed in perfect detail without one flaw any-
where, so they must be telling the truth and he was absolutely convinced
that Hitler committed suicide. The story at first sounds convincing, until
you realized that they could have memorized a story BEFOREHAND and
these were all people who almost WORSHIPPED Hitler. Do witnesses
EVER agree *perfectly* in detail in real life?

Former Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes in his book *Frankly Speaking*
(as quoted in the April 1948 *The Cross and The Flag*): "While in Pots-
dam at the Conference of the Big Four, Stalin left his chair, came over and
clinked his liquor glass with mine in a very friendly manner. I said to him:
'Marshal Stalin, what is your theory about the death of Hitler?' Stalin re-
plied: "He is not dead. He escaped either to Spain or Argentina.'"

I still have the September, 1948, issue of a magazine called *The Plain
Truth* with the headline article: "IS HITLER ALIVE, OR DEAD?," subtitled:
"Here is summarized the conclusions of an exhaustive three-year investi-
gation -- together with reasons for believing Hitler may be alive and secretly
planning the biggest hoax of all history."

Another article in November, 1949, says "The Nazis went underground,
May 16, 1943!" and details a meeting at the residence of Krupp von Bohlen-
Halbach, the head of I.G. FARBEN, etc., at which they planned "FOR
WORLD WAR III."

Another article in August, 1952, entitled "HITLER DID NOT DIE," subtitled
"Adolph Hitler's fake suicide in his Berlin Bunker now is exposed as
History's greatest hoax! Positive evidence comes to light that Hitler did
not die -- here's new evidence that Hitler is alive, directing [the] Nazi under-
ground, today!"

The June, 1952, issue of *The Plain Truth* is headlined: "HITLER *May Be
Alive!"* The article states: "Now, NEW FACTS, or purported facts, leak out.
It's reported now that in 1940 the Nazis started to amass tractors, planes,
sledges, gliders, and all sorts of machinery and materials IN THE SOUTH
POLAR REGIONS -- that for the next 4 years Nazi technicians built, on an
almost unknown CONTINENT, Antarctica, the Fuhrer's SHANGRILA -- a
new Berchtesgaden."

The report says they scooped out an entire mountain, built a new refuge
completely camouflaged -- a magic mountain hide-a-way. The recently
discovered continent is larger than Europe -- 5,600 miles from Africa, 1,900
miles from the southern tip of South America, 4,800 miles from Australia.

It is NOT a mere ice-covered surface, but a real continent, with plains,
valleys, mountain peaks up to 15,000 feet. The temperature in the interior
is around zero (?) in the summer, and never drops below 20 or 30 degrees
below in the winter. In other words, it is not as cold as in parts of North
Dakota or Canada." (especially underground, where the natural temperature
would be in the 50's, even below snow and ice. - Wol.)

*Bonjour* magazine, the *Police Gazette,* and the Paris newspaper *Le
Monde* all had articles about Hitler's South Pole hideaway. Admiral Doe-
nitz, in 1943, stated, "The German submarine fleet has even now estab-
lished an earthly paradise, an impregnable fortress, for the Fuhrer, in
whatever part of the world." Although he did not specify where the exact
location was, *Bonjour* pointed out that in 1940 Nazi engineers had begun
construction of buildings that were to withstand temperatures to 60 degrees
below zero.

There have been strong rumors, from the end of the War, that Hitler esca-
ped to the South Pole. Yet, most people simply REFUSE to believe the
evidence, the idea that Hitler survived the war is just unacceptable! It is 
too upsetting to too many people!

There is plenty of PROOF that the Americans and Russians LIED about
what happened to Hitler, and there are strong rumors that he escaped to
Antarctica. There is ample proof that a major group of Nazis escaped to
Argentina. What do YOU think? Why did Admiral Byrd lead an *invasion 
to Antarctica,* and why the extreme secrecy about the whole situation?

In 1981, Donald McKale wrote *Hitler: The Survival Myth* to try to lay to
rest the questions about what happened to Hitler. The flyleaf says: "In
this book a distinguished historian examines the postwar world's most
absorbing and persistent mystery, revealing why it has endured and where
the mystery leads" (emphasis mine). The back flyleaf says "Absolute
certainty about what happened still eludes us today."

Just recently on TV there are STILL programs telling "at last, the final,
once and for all, this is the real story" about what happened to Hitler,
yet they all do not really answer the question. A recent TV program, called
"What Really Happened to Adolph Hitler," after investigating numerous
stories, ends by saying that, in spite of Glasnost and the new freedom
of access to Russian files, the files on Hitler are still some of the most
highly classified items of the Soviets.

The *Diario Illustrado* of Santiago, Chile, January 18, 1948 issue, said:
"On 30th of April, 1945, Berlin was in dissolution but little of that dissolu-
tion was evident at Templehof Airfield. At 4:15 p.m. a JU52 landed and
S.S. troops directly from Rechlin for the defense of Berlin disembarked,
all of them young, not older than 18 years.

The gunner in the particular plane was an engineer by the name of B...
whom I had known for a number of years and for whom I had endeavored
to get exemption from military service. He sought to tank up and leave
Berlin as quickly as possible. During this re-fueling interval Mr. B... was
suddenly elbowed in the ribs by his radio operator with a nod to look in
a certain direction.

At about 100-120 meters he saw a sleek Messerschmitt Jet Model 332
[an editorial comment says this should be an ARADO 234]. Br. B.. and
the radio operator saw, and WITHOUT ANY DOUBT whatsoever, standing
in front of the jet, their Commander in Chief, Adolf Hitler, dressed in field-
grey uniform and gesticulating animatedly with some Party functionaries,
who were obviously seeing him off.

For about ten minutes whilst their plane was being refueled the two men
observed this scene and around 4:30 p.m. they took to the air again. They
were extremely astonished to hear during the midnight military news
bulletin, some seven and a half hours later, that Hitler had committed
suicide."

On a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program called *As It Happens,*
September 17th, 1974 at 7:15 p.m., a Prof. Dr. Ryder Saguenay, oral
surgeon from the Dental Faculty of the University of California at Los
Angeles, said that Hitler had ordered a special plane to leave from Berlin
with all medical and dental records, especially X-rays, of all top Nazis for
an unknown destination. He said that the dental records used to identify
Hitler's body were drawn from MEMORY by a dental assistant, WHO dis-
appeared and was never found.

An editorial in *Zig Zag,* Santiago, Chile, January 16, 1948, STATES that
on April 30th, 1945, Flight Captain Peter Baumgart took Adolf Hitler, his
wife Eva Braun, as well as a few loyal friends by plane from Tempelhof
Airport to Tondern in Denmark (still German controlled). From Tondern,
they took another plane to Kristiansund in Norway (also German controlled).
From there they joined a submarine convoy. (*U.F.O. Letzte Geheimwaffe
des III Reiches,* Mattern, pp. 50-51.)

The Jewish writer Michael Bar-Zohar in *The Avengers,* p. 99, said: "In
1943 Admiral Doenitz had declared: 'The German U-boat fleet is proud to
have made an earthly paradise, an impregnable fortress for the Fuhrer,
somewhere in the world.' He did not say in what part of the world it existed,
but fairly obviously it was in South America."

The German writer Mattern said that Admiral Doenitz told a graduating
class of naval cadets in Kiel in 1944: "The German Navy has still a great
role to play in the future. The German Navy knows all hiding places for the
Navy to take the Fuhrer to, should the need arise. There he can prepare his
last measures in complete quiet."
