If this case is authentically UFO-related - and at this time I have no
reason to believe it is not - then all of us are going to have to
reevaluate to one degree or another our tentative conclusions as to
the possible specific intentions, moral perspectives and general
agenda that some of our extraterrestrial visitors may have.

There have been rumors of homicidal, UFO-related, human mutilation
cases for some time now but hard evidence has been lacking. Until,
perhaps, now. Brazilian ufologist Encarnacion Zapata Garcia and Dr.
Rubens Goes have recently presented a series of sensational
photographs, obtained from police files which mimic the wounds of
countless UFO-related animal mutilation cases that have been reported
in Europe and North, Central and South America since the 1960s. On
first glance they would seem to be ufology's worst nightmare.

What is more disturbing is that Brazilian ufologists and police have
intimated that there may be at least a dozen or more cases similar to
the recently uncovered Guarapiranga reservoir case. If this is true,
it is somewhat doubtful that any of this potential new material will
ever see the light of day, given the official attitudes now prevailing
in Western power circles. But we can be grateful for fortuitous
disclosures, and the Guarapiranga case and it's accompanying
photographs seem to be just that. A great stroke of luck, albeit a
dismaying one. Obviously if the Guarapiranga data is legitimate, then
it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the position that all
visitors are demonstrating a relatively friendly attitude toward
humans, regardless of what their specific agenda(s) may be. The
Guarapiranga situation indicates that there is at least one group of
alien visitors to the planet who have a complete disdain for human
sensibilities, who, in fact, could care less about the value of human
life.

When I learned of the Guarapiranga case through Brazilian ufologist
A.J. Gevaerd, who first published the related photos in his magazine
UFO, my interest was stimulated and I quickly made plans for a trip to
Brazil. In Sao Paulo I met Encarnacion Garcia at the home of well
known ufologist Claudeir Covo and talked with her later at length.
Then I traveled to Campo Grande and questioned Gevaerd. He was kind
enough to supply me with second generation photographs (the best
available) of the Guarapiranga reservoir victim having himself become
thoroughly convinced that the evidence supporting the case was
authentic and that the case was UFO-related. I came to the same
conclusion because all other alternatives were neither supported by
facts nor good logic, whereas the similarities to numerous cattle
mutilations which I had studied in the United States were startling,
exactly paralleling what I have seen many times before.

The specifics of the case are as follows:

Encarnacion Garcia learned from her friend, Dr. Rubens Goes, that he
was in possession of some rather "odd" photos which had been given to
him by his cousin, police technician, Rubens Sergio. These were
official photos of a body that had been found near Guarapiranga
reservoir on the 29th of September, 1988, of an unnamed male who was,
however, later identified. The name of this man has been withheld from
all media investigators, including UFO investigators, at the request
of his relatives.

After studying the photos, Encarnacion Garcia was impressed with how
similar the wounds of the body were to those found on the carcasses of
so many UFO-related mutilated animals, knowledge which the original
investigating police officials and medical doctors involved with the
case did not possess. Surprisingly, Dr. Cuenca, head of the primary
investigation, offered his files on the case. This is the stroke of
luck which I previously mentioned and for which we can all be
thankful. These included the all-. important autopsy description to
which I will momentarily refer.

The initial police report, however, was not extraordinary in nature
except for the recognition that the body, although extremely
mutilated, had not met with unusual violence; that is, there were no
signs of struggle or the application of bondage of any kind.

It was the autopsy report itself which was most revealing, especially
when we compare the remarks made there with what we have learned from
animal mutilation cases elsewhere. It is imperative to remember, as I
have stated previously, that the individuals conducting the autopsy
had no knowledge of similar animal mutilation cases. This makes the
official remarks of the report all the more revealing in retrospect.

Encarnacion Garcia received copies of seven photos. I have included
the five most revealing ones here with a description and commentary.
The work of the perpetrators of this atrocity: the kinds of cuts made,
the precision of the cuts, the removal of whole internal organs
through small apertures, the lack of bleeding, the failure of the body
to smell or decompose rapidly - all these are hallmarks of UFO-related
animal mutilations. These peculiarities would seem to rule out
Satanists, revenge- seekers or casual mutilators and go beyond even
the capacities of a modern Jack the Ripper.

Photo #I: Face and upper torso photo. The body was in perfect
condition. Rigor mortis had not set in and it was estimated that the
victim had been killed approximately 48 to 72 hours previously. There
were no signs of animal predation or putrefaction which might be
expected. Strangely, there was no odor to the cadaver. Bleeding from
the wounds had been minimal. The black coloration found in the face
area and in other places within the photo is partly due to low light
exposure when this photo and others were taken. It is also partly due
to coagulated blood in the wound areas.

As can clearly be seen, flesh and lips have been excised around the
mandibles, as is common in cattle and other animal mutilations, the
autopsy report noted that "the eyes and ears were also removed and the
mouth cavity was emptied." Removal of these body parts, including the
tongue as here, is common enough in animal mutilation cases.

As Encarnacion Garcia rightly recognized, if a comparison of the
victim with animal mutilation cases is made, "You can see they are the
same - and that is also the conclusion of experienced doctors." The
doctors drew their conclusion only after they had been shown
photographs of similar animal mutilation cases, cases with which they
were not previously familiar.

The autopsy report states: "There has been a removal of extensive
tissue along many parts of the face, head and neck of the victim...
There has also been extraction of ocular tissue, eyes, auditive
internal and external organs (ears) and entire parts of the head. The
tongue and several muscles were also extracted."

The kinds of cuts on the cadaver are what we have come to expect in
UFO-related animal mutilation cases. Of primary interest is their
precision. The "surgery" (or butchery, if you will) was done with
agility and care and probably with speed. The lack of profuse bleeding
suggests the use of a laser-like instrument producing acute heat, thus
cauterizing almost immediately the edge of the wounds. This is a
speculation on my part, however, although there are numerous
precedents. Many of the cases studied by Dr. John Altshuler in the
United States exhibit this kind of high heat, rapid surgery. Whether
it would still be possible to test fragments of the flesh from the
victim's wound areas is doubtful. Suffice it to say the wounds appear
to be exact replicas of cases studied by Dr. Altshuler, Tom Adams, Bob
Pratt, Ted Oliphant, Linda Howe, Colman VonKeviczky and myself.

Photo #2: (Above) Face and upper torso with arms outstretched. Perhaps
it is best to begin here with several quotes from the autopsy report.
"The axillary regions on both sides showed soft spots where organs had
been removed. Incisions were made on the face, internal thorax,
abdomen, legs, arms, and chest." As Garcia observed, the doctors
stated that these wounds were quite uncommon. The report also
observes, "Shoulders and arms have perforations of 1 to 1.5 inches in
diameter where tissue and muscles were extracted. The edges of the
perforations were uniform and so was their size. The chest had shrunk
due to the removal of internal organs."

In other words, internal organs were removed or sucked somehow through
these small circular incisions. Why such a technique? Some doctors
today are using a similar method to remove diseased tissue and organs
from their human subjects - but this kind of procedure injures those
organs in the process. Did the "surgeons" who worked on this victim
care whether the organs were injured or not? What kind of specimens
were they looking for? What kind of research is this? Wouldn't it be
easier and more medically expedient to abduct a human specimen and
study it live, including its anatomy and physiology, in a properly
equipped laboratory? It would appear that the perpetrators of this act
did not care if the man's life was lost nor did they care if the body
were found. Here we have strong indication of a total disregard for
the specimen and, by extension, for human life in general. The body
was left as trash. What does this say about the perpetrators and their
attitudes?

The photo clearly shows the symmetrical holes in the man's arms. One
arm clearly shows the sunken area near the perforation clearly,
demonstrating where muscle has been extracted. The shrunken chest area
also indicates a similar process of internal extractions. It is
significant that the police and medical examiners were convinced the
holes found in the head, arms, stomach, anus and legs were not
produced by bullet wounds.

Photo #3: Close up of the left side of the victim's head. Here we see
that the ear is cleanly excised. As the report states, "auditive
internal and external" matter was removed The photo does not show the
small holes discovered in the cranium. These were detected, however,
by the medical examiners. How much, if any, of the brain tissue was
removed is not stated.

Photo #4: Close up of lower torso including thighs. The stretcher,
pants and cord that are visible belonged to the rescue team. The
autopsy report continues, "You also find the removal of the belly
button leaving a 1.5 inch hole in the abdomen and a depressed
abdominal cavity showing the removal of the intestines." Brazilian
doctors who later viewed the evidence were left nonplused by the hole
in the umbilical area where, it appeared, "a great amount of internal
organs were extracted. The edge of the hole was perfect and shows a
precision cut. Also, the abdominal area of the body was very shrunken
because of organ removal." The original autopsy report notes that "the
scrotum was also removed by a 3 x 1.5 cm. elliptical incision."
Strangely, the penis itself was left intact although it appeared to
have been stretched to about twice its normal length. Why excise the
scrotum without taking the penis? Human logic is defied by such
actions. We are aware, however, of the great similarity here with
other animal mutilation cases, particularly female cattle where it is
not unusual to see anus, teats, vagina and uterus extracted. But why
exactly this is done is as big a mystery as who the exact perpetrators
are, although there is enough strong circumstantial evidence to
implicate UFO involvement.

The hole in the left leg duplicates in size the umbilical hole and the
arm hole previously discussed. In the words of the autopsy report, "It
was an... elliptical incision of about 3 x 1. 5 cm...The penis was
stretched and had no signs of being cut. The testicles were extracted
with a precision cut." Rather startling is the lack of pubic hair, as
if the victim had been readied for surgery.

Early on in the investigation, Brazilian official investigators
considered the possibility that the castration of the victim was an
act of revenge. They soon rejected this theory, however, because it
could not account for the remaining wounds and the other peculiarities
related to the body. What is more, revenge seekers who castrate
usually excise the penis, not just the scrotum.

Photo #5: Victim lying on his stomach. The autopsy report specifies:
-"Removal of the anus and a hole between the second and third
toes...The anal orifice of the victim was extracted with a large
incision about 3 by 6 inches in diameter. The rectum and other
internal parts of the human discharge system were also removed. It is
probable that even some of the internal organs of the man could have
been removed through this incision."

What is most compelling about the anal incision and the extraction of
anal and digestive tract tissue is that it is a carbon copy of the
surgery we have seen in so many UFO-related animal mutilation cases.
Are we supposed to believe a revengeful human or a group of Satanists
are capable of such precise, difficult, surgical techniques/procedures
which leave even medical professionals perplexed as to how they could
have been done? I think not. Has the Brazilian and/or American
government staged a little demonstration at the Guarapiranga reservoir
to frighten UFO investigators and the general public into fearing all
extraterrestrial contact? In other words, are we faced with a
gruesome, carefully orchestrated display of misinformation? Possibly,
but probably not, and my reasons for believing this are several.

First, it would seem a fortuitous turn of events that ufologist
Encarnacion Zapata Garcia had the right friend(s) in the right places
at the right time. If our government, and presumably the Brazilian
government, has kept a lid on similarly sensational material in the
past - and I have no doubt there is more than ample evidence
supporting such a contention - here we have an accidental bubble that
has, against all odds, escaped the pot. It is our good fortune, you
might say.

The photos are definitely causing a stir; causing many people,
including some UFO investigators, to do some new thinking. But the
powers that control lids will be carefully double-checking in the near
future to make sure the pot is as secure as possible. Thus I would not
get my hopes up that additional homicidal, UFO-related human
mutilation cases and graphic photographs accompanying them will
surface in the near future.

If we discard the possibility of the Guarapiranga case as a piece of
misinformation, we are left with several intriguing alternatives. Is
this the infrequent act of a rogue extraterrestrial group which from
time to time enjoys indulging themselves in a pathological blood sport
at the expense of humans? Perhaps. More likely, I think, we are
indirect witnesses to an intentionally contemptuous act by a group or
species of extraterrestrial origin who would like to give other
visiting species a bad name and, as a bonus, harness mankind into a
greater fear-mentality than already binds it. But these are only
speculations and we will have to wait until a future time for a
greater truth when more thorough revelations, and evidence that
supports them, become available.

Do we have any precedents to the Guarapiranga case? Yes, we do. At
least one good example and the rumors of possibly another. The case of
Sgt. Jonathan P Louette, who was stationed at White Sands Missile Test
Range in 1956 and whose mutilated body was found on the Range three
days after an Air Force major had witnessed his abduction by a "disk
shaped" object, bares a striking resemblance to the Guarapiranga
situation. Louette's genitals had been removed, his rectum cored out
with surgical precision and his eyes excised in a manner quite similar
to the incisions made upon our Guarapiranga victim. And then there is
the rumor of the Texas mutilation case which occurred - and was
quickly hushed up - in the mid '60s. I have had verification ofthe
legitimacy of this by two intelligence agency personnel, one active
and one retired, but have not had time to investigate further.

At present, the rumors of human body parts found on at least one
crashed UFO in the 1940s, body parts found in a barn in the state of
Oregon several years ago or the rumor of a mutilated Vietnam War B-52
crew will have to remain just that - rumors, until the lid
accidentally, albeit infrequently, comes ajar again and we have some
solid evidence. But there is no denying that the Guarapiranga
reservoir case has taken us far beyond rumor. The evidence is
unmistakable and it is sobering. On the one hand, it points stunningly
in a UFO-related direction. On the other hand, I believe it would be
wise of us to draw a tentative conclusion if other less violent cases
have not already led us to do so. We should not, in most cases,
generalize about our extraterrestrial visitors; neither about their
motives , morals nor research agendas. And one addendum also seems
advisable: In an age when almost anything has come to seem possible,
if not probable, either cosmically or here on earth, the wisest course
might be to let our extraterrestrial visitors demonstrate their
friendliness before jumping to conclusions about their philanthropy
and opening the door too wide. After all, Little Red Riding Hood, nine
times out of ten, is no match for the wolf at the door.

We have seen in the past, especially in Brazil, many cases where Human
beings have been attacked by UFOs and their occupants. This is an
undeniable reality that many researchers do not want to face. The
Fenomeno Chupa-Chupa or "Suck-Suck" phenomenon which occurred in the
Amazon and northeastern part of the country in the '70s and '80s
produced hundreds of injured people and ultimately some fatalities.
These mostly impoverished people were usually attacked by small probes
(3-6 inches in diameter), probably unmanned, little UFOs which emitted
strong, burning beams of light. Many of the victims suffered not only
burns but a significant loss of blood (thus the "suck-suck"
appellation) during their encounters. Some, such as Luiz Fernandes
Barroso, suffered appreciable mental as well as physical
incapacitation. Barroso's mind was reduced to that of a two-year-old
long before his death.

In North America, reports of brutal manhandling by UFO occupants are
much rarer. If homicidal, UFO-related human mutilations have taken
place they have either gone unrecognized for what they really are or
have been adeptly covered up by official intervention. Whatever the
truth may be, the Guarapiranga reservoir case and the startling photos
which accompany it should give us pause for thought. I, like ufologist
editor A.J. Gevaerd, came to the conclusion after reviewing the
evidence that UFO-related mutilators were most probably the
perpetrators of the abominations revealed by the photographs of the
Guarapiranga reservoir victim. And I believe Gevaerd is probably right
when he says most extraterrestrial visitors seem neutral in their
attitudes towards Earth and earth humans, some are friendly and some
could care less. We had better learn, I think, to discern the
differences. It might in the long run save our world culture and our
very lives.
