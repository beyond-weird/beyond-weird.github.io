3MICHIGAN CASE:  A family of four began seeing a very large  3
3transparent bubble of ball of light (about 10 feet across)  3
3in early Augest.  Other witnesses began to see the object at3
3close range.                                                3

3None of the witnesses have felt threatened by the object but3
3they felt that they were being observed.                    3

3OREGON CASE:  August 15, 1992, 12:07 a.m.  Duration of the  3
3sighting was 15 seconds at close range, 2 hours total visual3

3A triangular-shaped object with lights, emitting no sound,  3
3was sighted slowly flying South East.  The object turned and3
3flew over Salem Airport in an easterly direction, to a spot 3
3over the Cascade Mountains, and remained there for one hour.3

3The object then flew north towards Mt. Hood.  After reaching3
3the mountain, it turned and flew back to the original       3
3position and remained there for another hour.               3

3April 1990.  Two Boy Scout Leaders were putting up a tent   3
3near a small lake after arriving at a campground near       3
3midnight.  A light moving above the treeline across the lake3
3was assumed to be an airplane until it crossed the lake and 3
3stopped less than 50 yards away.  It was reported to be the 3
3size of a fist at arm's length, it hovered for maybe a      3
3minute in complete silence before moving off rapidly down   3
3the shore of the lake.  The incident was immediately        3
3reported to the camp ranger who remembers them as being very3

3October 1992.  A college graduate in his mid-thirties was   3
3putting out the garbage around 8:30 p.m. when he noticed a  3
3strange white light an estimated 2 to 4 miles NE of his     3
3home, approximately over the Amite River.                   3

3The light appeared to be 400 to 500 feet high and about 100 3
3to 200 feet above it was a red light, both stationary.      3

3Realizing there was no tower in that area and that the      3
3lights did not resemble an aircraft or helicopter, he moved 3
3around the house for a better view.  During the             3
3approximate five minutes that he watched, the red light     3
3twice suddenly jumped to a position well to the left of it's3
3location over the white light, remained there a few seconds,3
3then jumped back to it's original position.  Shortly after  3
3it's second move, both lights suddenly disappeared.         3

3On Tuesday, August 25, 1992, a Durant resident called the   3
3Oklahoma MUFON State Director at 11:30 p.m. and stated that 3
3herself and a number of witnesses were watching a brightly  3
3lit object to their west and had been doing so since about  3
311:00 that night.  She described in detail what they were   3
3seeing.                                                     3
3                                                            3
3The first witness observed the object when he had gone to   3
3bed.  The time was 10:51 p.m.  He looked out the west window3
3of his home which was open with the shades up.              3
3                                                            3
3When he first saw the object, he thought it was a plane.    3
3But when it moved fast, from one position to another, behind3
3a tree to another opening between the trees, he then        3
3realized that it was not a conventional aircraft.  It moved 3
3too fast too quickly to be an airplane.                     3
3                                                            3
3The couple had company over, and the husband (first witness)3
3yelled for the others in the house to watch the object.  He 3
3said that it jumped to the right and stopped, swung like a  3
3pendulum back and forth, and then stopped motionless.       3
3                                                            3
3The others came to the bedroom to see the object, then      3
3proceeded to move outside.  Witness number 2 (wife) saw the 3
3object and described it to be about 1 1/8 inches across at  3
3arms length (a circular oval template was used to judge the 3
3size of the object).  She saw it when it was angled towards 3
3her and saw a portion of the bottom of the object, which was3
3described as darker.                                        3
3                                                            3
3According to her statement, the object was conical with     3
3light rays emitting down from the bottom edge.  It was      3
3shaped like the top of a bullet - pointed at the top, then  3
3extending down and outward to form an umbrella shape, but   3
3more of a pointed umbrella shape.  It was flat on the       3
3bottom.  No protrusions were noticed.  She said that she    3
3could see the shape when she looked to the side of the      3
3object.  She had glasses on and they are corrected for      3
3nearsightedness.                                            3
3                                                            3
3Witness number 3 entered the husband's bedroom as the       3
3husband stated" You ain't going to believe this, but this is3
3not a star.  That is something else."                       3
3                                                            3
3The light was moving in an erratic manner.  When the husband3
3went outside and regained sight of the object, it appeared  3
3as a definite conical shape.  Unlike the wife's report,     3
3which stated that the object was all white, the husband     3
3reported three colors - blue on top, yellow in the middle   3
3and white on the lower third.                               3
3                                                            3
3The husband's account and drawing indicated a more elongated3
3object with basically the same shaped top (more like an     3
3artillery shell).  His account indicates that at arms       3
3length, the object was about 3/4 inches wide and about 1 1/83
3inches tall.  It is possible that they were watching it     3
3change shape.                                               3
3                                                            3
3Each witness was interviewed separately.                    3
3                                                            3
3Witness number 2 described the light emitted by the craft   3
3resembled an inverted gas flame on a kitchen range.  The    3
3bottom was darker than the rest of the craft, but her report3
3indicates the object must have either been tilted slightly  3
3or was higher when she looked at it than when witness number3
33 saw the shape.  She stated it was a pendulum motion or    3
3possibly rotated.                                           3
3                                                            3
3Witness number 4 stated that she was not wearing            3
3prescription glasses at the time of the sighting, as she was3
3required to wear them normally, but she could see the light.3
3She corroborated what the others had said.                  3

3"force."  She glanced at her bedside clock and saw that it  3
3was 1:10 AM.  The next recollection of the witness is that  3
3she awakened with a jolt in her bed and that the time was   3
33:10 AM.                                                    3
