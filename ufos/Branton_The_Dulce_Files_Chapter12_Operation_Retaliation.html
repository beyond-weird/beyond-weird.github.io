OPERATION RETALIATION: PAUL BENNEWITZ -- ONE MAN AGAINST AN EMPIRE





Following are quotations from a document [actually a detailed report,
called PROJECT BETA] which was compiled by scientist Paul Bennewitz for
officials at Kirtland AFB who were working with Bennewitz in an operational
plan to bring down the 'alien' base at Dulce, New Mexico... that was until
'other interests' deep within the intelligence community got involved and
brought enormous pressures against Bennewitz and various Kirtland AFB
officials -- Col. Edwards, AFOSI agent Richard Doty, the Wing Commander and
others who were involved -- to CEASE the investigation. Although Paul has
apparently been 'silenced', the discoveries which he has made in regards to
the physical-technological aspects of activity taking place in and around
Dulce cannot be silenced. PROJECT BETA is apparently a proposed plan for a
physical military attack on one of the major or 'KEY' basing installations
of the Draconis-Orion-Reticuli forces, and may be useful in any future
attempts to re-take the base from alien or ALIEN-CONTROLLED elements, and
to set free the human captives who are apparently being held in cold
storage or in subterranean prisons deep below the surface of the American
Southwest [and beyond]. Before dealing with the report itself, we will
quote some correspondence between Bennewitz and others, beginning with
excerpts from Paul's March 1986 letter to Clifford Stone, now director of
UFO CONTACT INTERNATIONAL in Albuquerque:



"Dear Clifford;

"...There is so much in this and so much has happened upon a near daily
basis to me for seven years that I don't know where to start first.

"I think probably the best approach is to start out with some explanation
in the way of statements relative to alien cultures here on Earth, their
social structures, physical makeup, etc., all of which has been gleaned
from the direct communications by computer, visual observation,
psychological evaluation, and personal interaction.

"First, there are the Low, High and Very High cultural levels. In the Low
levels of the culture there are sharply defined levels, which extend from
slave level on up. There is no freedom there -- no one crosses these lines
within -- cross it and you are dead. Everything is watched with optical
equipment and monitored by computers and individuals called 'Keepers'.

"Spheres of many sizes float throughout their environment, monitoring
audio, visual and thought frequencies (these have also been observed by
workers in underground facilities reaching miles below Edwards Air Force
Base and the Tahachapi mountains of California. - Branton). These units,
which have a highly mirrored finish, can be talked to. They can cloak
themselves so that they are totally invisible. Their control signal can be
broken down into varying AM and FM components. There is no trust in this
type of society. Everything is watched and monitored.

"The command structure is near totally unbelievable.

"The ruling levels wear robes of appropriate colors. The alien government
involved with this group is totalitarian. They appear not to observe social
and moral principles. Their credo appears to be total control or kill.

"In the North -- at the river -- the 'Orange' Insignia -- or at the Diamond
as the alien calls the base. The method of rule is a monarchy. The 'king'
wears purple. The high colors of social level wear green, yellow, and
white. The lower levels wore brown.

"Their body metabolism is very high, estimated at 110 to 115 degrees.
Elimination is through osmosis. Skin color of the ruling echelon varies
from a jaundiced yellow to white. No hair of any kind. The arms are long --
near to knee level. They have very long hands and fingers. All of them look
underfed. They have big heads and eyes. The humanoid types are generally
light green. When in need of formula or dead they turn GREY. Many in this
culture walk with a limp or shuffle their feet...

"There is a council in the North called THE NINE. ALL of them seem to be
cut from the same pattern. All appear to be highly vindictive and
ego-oriented. Their 'god' is called 'TA'."



And in a letter to Clifford Stone dated 3/19/86, Bennewitz writes:

"It would appear that the Greys in the north are near frantic about my
communications and want to stop me from talking (elsewhere Bennewitz
implied it was more of an 'interrogation' - Branton) with Io via the
computer.

"This morning I have a dark red streak down the left side of my face about
2 3/4 inches long and 1/4 inch wide. Based on experience, I would guess it
was done by one of those [mirrored] spheres in the bedroom last night. This
is typical of their distorted sense of logic. They operate on FEAR, but
their problem is that I DON'T FEAR THEM. All they have achieved with me is
that I totally ignore them. It would appear that they are deathly afraid of
the beings called Io and Jo [see High Culture -- the humanoids].

"You will find, if you have not already, that constant interaction will
result in learning how to be aware of, and in turn use, alien logic. IT IS
BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN FEAR AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS OF
FRIENDSHIP AND TRUST THAT THEY OPERATE A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE AND
EVERYTHING IS WATCHED.

"Now, if you look at those in the north (Colorado? - Branton)
pragmatically, they have achieved the ideal in terms of war machines and
weapons. With their machines and weapons they are 'brave' -- in their minds
-- without them they are just a quivering mass of fear.

(Note: I can also confirm Bennewitz' observations here, however I would
also add that in addition to their technology -- especially their
mind-control technology, and this relates to the following -- once one
breaks through the complex matrix of LIES that the Reptilian-Grey
collective projects, then they are found out to be nothing more than
'quivering' worms beneath the 'shell' as Bennewitz implies. In fact the
ONLY power that these soulless vermin -- the 'hybrids' and non-collectivist
reptiloids not included in this 'flaming' -- have over us is their complex
DECEPTIONS and our reciprocating and capitulating FEARS. Why am I so
confident to 'judge' the Greys and their 'collective' in this manner?
Because I myself had fallen for their lies many times before I discovered
what they were REALLY all about. As an example, the collectivist
reptiloids-dinoids-greys would have us to believe that they genetically
'created' us and put us on planet earth. In response 'we' [especially those
pathetic human agents who collaborate with them] tend to cower in absolute
fear before our/their supposed 'creators' and try to appease them since,
after all, "Resistance Is Futile!" In 'appeasing' them, we GIVE OUR POWER
TO THEM! We in essence then CREATE a force which is superior to us. -
Branton)

"To further enhance their 'bravery', they seek full control with the
IMPLANT. [The relative effectiveness of some of these implants seems to be
inversely proportional to expanded memory and awareness level]. They also
know that they can control large masses of people with lower intelligence
without implants -- shotgun manipulation with the beams. With that beam
they can and do create mass unrest.

"The High Culture Aliens known as the Eoku:

"The High is apparently the culture of Io and Jo. They do exhibit kindness,
empathy, and extreme intelligence in transmissions through the computer
(then how, one might ask, can they operate such a
death-fear-control-oriented system which has committed untold atrocities
and violations against human abductees? Are the Eoku only feigning their
benevolence? - Branton). Io's group culture is the Homo Sapians [humanoid]
variety.

"Based upon the input from Jo, his hair is brown and the female Io has red
hair. [Red-haired individuals claiming to be Star Travelers have shown up
here in Albuquerque on the ground]. They did give indication that bodies of
their group are here in Albuquerque in cryogenic containers. The location
is tentatively the FAA complex north of Albuquerque. It is a fenced and
guarded highly secure area. They indicated through the computer that 8 of
the Eoku were shot [by the US Government] and 11 bodies were the result of
crashes. [Note: The Eoku are not what are normally known as Greys, or at
least the ones that directly interact in human abductions].

"There are more bodies in storage... I don't know where they all are. I
knew the bodies had been moved from Maryland and are presently under US
Navy jurisdiction. Yesterday, the computer indicated a total of 40 bodies
[had been moved]."

EDITOR NOTE: [At last count there were more than 135 bodies in Government
hands -- of various descriptions. Some humans, Greys, Reptilians, etc. -
Val Valerian]

"I was shown a color photograph by Richard Doty two years or more ago of a
purported alien lifeform held prisoner. Supposedly it was taken at Los
Alamos. He was alive -- a light green color -- big eyes -- standing
directly in front of the camera...

"So far I know very little about the High except for what I have
experienced. They are Homo Sapien, and I would guess that they are the same
that accidentally [?] zapped Travis Walton. If the numbers are correct out
of the computer they number over 5,000. The other group is, I believe,
equivalent in number. Indications seem to be that they are operating from a
star ship in far orbit around the Earth.

"The culture has apparent social values and emotionalism. They seem to
display kindness and concern for individuals (then again we must ask, WHY
are they considered the 'leaders' of aliens which show little if any
'concern' for individuals? - Branton). Their technology is superior to ours
and also to the Greys based in the north, who are trying to "play god" with
badly distorted logic.

"The 'Very High' are very few in number. Their entire structure of
knowledge and social interaction is so far advanced that it is near
impossible for me to relate to. Again, much of this is based on personal
experience of which I have never talked with anyone about. In fact, you are
the first.

"I would guess that these 'very high' are quite old -- 1000 years is not
apparently unrealistic. I would guess that there are a few of them on the
star ship used by the 'high', and that they are preserved and cared for by
those on the ship...

"For over 300 years, a conflict has been going on between the Greys, who
are basically warlike and aggressive, and the higher factions in the
infrastructure." (Bennewitz does not explain the apparent dichotomy of how
compassionate humanoids and malevolent reptiloids who are at war with each
other could be part of the same 'infrastructure'. Perhaps both the Grays
and the Humanoids utilize the same collective-mind-network and therefore
are intricatally tied-in with the other whether they like it or not. This
would make the "High" and "Very High" leaders in something equivalent to
the Ashtar collective. - Branton)





P R O J E C T B E T A

[WITH SUGGESTIONS AND GUIDELINES]



PROJECT BETA

Investigator -- Physicist -- Paul F. Bennewitz



The following are key mile posts established or discovered during the
continuing scientific study concerning Alien intervention and the result.
[Study limited soley to New Mexico]

1) Two years continuous recorded electronic surveillance and tracking with
D.F. 24 hr/day data of alien ships within sixty [60] miles radius of
Albuquerque plus 6000 feet motion picture of same -- daylight and night.

2) Detection and disassembly of alien communication and video channels --
both local, earth, and near space.

3) Constant reception of video from alien ship and underground base
viewscreen; Typical alien, humanoid and at times apparent Homo Sapiens.

4) A case history of an Encounter Victim in New Mexico which lead to the
communication link and discovery that apparently all encounter victims have
deliberate alien implants along with obvious accompanying scars. The
victim's implants were verified by x-ray and Cat Scan. Five other scar
cases were also verified.

5) Established constant direct communications with the Alien using a
computer and a form of Hex Decimal Code with Graphics and print-out. This
communication was instigated apparently after the US base was vacated
(following U.S. intelligence's apparent loss of the Dulce Wars? - Branton)

6) Through the alien communication loop, the true underground base location
was divulged by the alien and precisely pin-pointed.

7) Subsequent aerial and ground photographs revealed landing pylons, ships
on the ground -- entrances, beam weapons and apparent launch ports -- along
with aliens on the ground in electrostaticly supported vehicles; charging
beam weapons also apparently electrostatic.

8) Cross correlation and matching by triangulation, etc., to official NASA
CIR [color infrared] high resolution films confirmed base locations and
resulted in revealing US Military involvement yielding precise coordinates
and the US base layout.

9) Prior alien communication had indicated military involvement and the
fact [that] the USAF had a ship but due to studied alien psychology this
was ignored at the time.

10) Subsequently, the alien communicated following verification with the
CIR, that there was indeed a ship; actually more than one -- that two were
wrecked and left behind and another built -- this ship is atomic powered
and flying. The alien indicated its basing location.

11) Is was learned as stated that two women and a boy near Austin, Texas
were exposed to severe radiation at close range and the ship was last seen
going West with helicopters. In addition, the US Government was quietly
picking up the [medical] expenses.

12) Subsequent inspection of motion picture photographs taken during the
study revealed the US ship or one like it flying with the aliens. These
match the CIR where two can be seen on the ground and in the later
photographs taken on the ground after the base was abandoned.



"So in very brief form the prologue to learning within reasonable accuracy
what transpired prior to the end of 1979 or shortly thereafter.

"The computer communications and constant interaction with the alien in
this manner WITHOUT direct encounter has given a reasonably clear picture
of the alien psychology, their logic and logic methods and their prime
intent.

"It is important to note at the outset, the alien is DEVIOUS, employs
DECEPTION, has NO INTENT of any apparent peace making process and obviously
does NOT adhere to any prior arranged agreement.

"In truth they tend to LIE, however their memory for lying is not long and
direct comparative computer printout analysis reveals this fact. Therefore
much "drops through the crack" so to speak; and from this comes the
apparent truth.

"It is not the intent of this report to criticize or point fingers.
Obviously whoever made the initial agreement was operating upon our basis
of logic and not that of the alien and in so doing apparently walked
innocently, in time, into a trap.

"The alien indicated that the 'Greys', apparently the group initially
involved in the agreement, were still upset about the initial capture and
subsequent death of the first eight of their co-fellows.

"Another group, calling themselves in the Computer language, the 'Orange'
-- their base is on the west slope of Mt. Archuleta -- directly west of the
south end of the U.S. base and near NW of the apparent main landing area
they call, in the Computer language, "The Diamond". This, because from a
distance, it looks diamond shaped in the photographs when looking somewhat
south west past the observation tower toward the ridged peak SE of Mt.
Archuleta. This ridged peak has no name, I call it South Peak.

"The base extends north of this peak to the edge of the cliff down which
goes a road past a large alloy dome thirty-eight [38] foot across the
bottom and with a twenty [20] foot hole in the top.

"Based upon some of the aerial photographs during which the alien was
caught in the open and launching -- some launches appear to be coming from
the direction of the dome. I would guess it is an underground launch egress
facility. In the NASA CIR there is what appears to be a black limousine
alongside the dome on a ramp. Surprisingly it is precisely the size of my
79 Lincoln Town Car. Wheeled vehicles and what appear to be Snow Cats or
Catapillars can be seen throughout the CIR -- car and truck tracks, trucks
and jeeps. I don't believe aliens have wheels -- humans do.

"Numerous road blocks extend northward through the U.S. base along a well
maintained road thirty some-odd feet wide -- apparently gravel -- near all
weather -- numerous turn arounds and wheel tracks into launch preparation
areas with the ships; pads marked with twenty-six [26] foot Xs and
servicing facilities, tanks, etc. -- two domed polygon high voltage
buildings on north on the east side of the road, also an apparent
foundation for another or a helo pad -- test stands, human housing, water
tank [thirty-two foot across] -- and at one of the main road blocks, two
large vehicles parked across the road. Also at that point another apparent
black limousine with tracks leading to it [and] to the west of the road.
All tracks and vehicles have been dimensioned and match military vehicles.
IF I were to make a guess, I would estimate the likelihood that the
apparent black limousines are CIA.

"This is but a limited inventory of what was there on Sept. 8, 1978 --
included only as evidential matter for your perusal and confirmation. The
road, which incidentally the natives, the tribal chief, reservation police
and highway patrolman know nothing about, comes in off of a trail from the
north. Starting at the trail, line of sight to the large plateau area and
the alloy dome, the road, in the middle of nowhere on the Jiccarilla
Reservation, is precisely 12,888 ft. long airline distance. The total alien
basing area, which apparently contains SEVERAL cultures [now all under the
designation 'UNITY' in the Computer language] is approximately three (3) Km
wide by eight (8) Km long [multi-leveled]. A conservative guess based upon
the number of ships presently over this area and the number on the ground
in the CIR photographs, the total alien population at this point is AT
LEAST two thousand and most likely MORE. The alien indicates MORE are
coming or on the way.

"I won't attempt to speculate in this report as to how the initial U.S.
contact was made -- what transpired, nor how many were able to escape. The
alien has communicated his account, and if totally true, it certainly is
not palatable.

"Much detail has been omitted for future discussion if desired -- however
the import is this. Constant computer communication -- full on line in
February of this year -- manual prior to that -- conditions of morale and a
total insight into "what makes the alien run". This is VERY valuable data.

1) Most importantly, the alien will allow no one to go without an implant
AND after knowledge of it is wiped out. They simply will not allow it. All
indications are that communication or language cannot result without the
implant [with the exception of the Binary and the Computer]. This would
indicate a possible immediate threat or danger for anyone -- military, Air
Force, or otherwise that has been at the base. They WILL NOT remember the
implant in any case [the contactee here included].

"The reason for the implant is multiple for both language or communication
by thought [there is no apparent language barrier with thought] and also
COMPLETE ABSOLUTE CONTROL by the alien through program -- by their beam or
direct contact.

"I have tested this and found that during this programming the person then
has no memory of the act/conversation afterward. IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO
THE MILITARY, I NEED NOT ELABORATE AS THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES. The
victim's 'switch' can be pulled at any time and at the same time they are
"walking cameras and microphones" if the alien chooses to listen in with
the use of their beams.

"No classified area of any endeavor in the U.S. is inviolate under these
conditions. However -- realize -- the scars, barely visible -- CAN be seen
-- ALL are exactly located and ALL are accessible by x-ray.

"2) Also note that all of the aliens -- human, humanoid alike -- all must
have implants -- without them, no direct communication is apparently
possible. So one can most generally arbitrarily say that IF a person states
he/she communicated by thought with an alien -- he/she most likely has been
implanted. They may also claim to be overly psychic and be able to prove
this -- again through the link transplant, he/she is given the information
by the alien and does not realize.

"3) Most importantly, the alien, either through evolvement or because the
humanoid is 'made' -- will exhibit tendencies for bad logic [bad by earth
logic comparison] so they ARE NOT infallible -- in point of fact they
appear to have many more frailties and weaknesses than the normal Homo
Sapiens (which they attempt to compensate for through their technology -
Branton). To the alien, the mind is key and therein lies a great weakness
which will be discussed later.

"4) They ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. It is suspected if one was considered a
'friend' and if one were to call upon that 'friend' in time of dire
physical threat, the 'friend' would quickly side with the other side.

"The computer indicates in comparison, that no known earth protagonist,
Russian or otherwise, exhibit these tendencies to any major degree
indicating the DANGER involved in making any kind of agreement with these
aliens -- at least of this species.

"5) The alien does KILL with the beam generally. Results on a human will
exhibit a three to four cm purple circle. If done from the rear, on one or
both shoulders. The results on cattle are the same, essentially exhibiting
purple beneath the hide, with burned circles on the outside.

"6) Cattle mutilations are the other side of the coin and will not be
delved into here although they are a part of the overall. It appears the
humanoids are fed by a formula made from HUMAN OR CATTLE material or BOTH
and they are made from the same material by gene splicing and the use of
female encounter victim's ovum. The resultant embyros are referred to by
the alien as an 'organ'. Time of gestation to full use as a utility, ready
to work appears to be about one year. A year in alien time -- I do not
know.

"Solution: I doubt there is an immediate total 'cure' per se -- however,
they MUST BE STOPPED and we have to get off dead center before we find time
has run out. They are picking up and 'cutting' [as the alien calls it] many
people every night. Each implanted individual is apparently ready for the
pull of their 'switch'. Whether all implants are totally effective I cannot
predict, but CONSERVATIVELY I would estimate at least 300,000 or more in
the U.S. and as least 2,000,000 if not more worldwide.

"WEAPONRY AND INHERENT WEAKNESSES: Weaponry is one of the keys and in the
alien's present state we CAN prepare an effective offense.

"One tends at the outset [I did] to look at their machines and say -- there
is no defense or offense. One is overwhelmed by their speed, apparent
capability of invisibility and 'cloaking', and other covert capabilities
not discussed at this time. In particular -- the beam weapons are
themselves a direct threat and obviously one that must be seriously
considered but not overly so.

"Let us first look at just what this weapon is. It is an electro-static
weapon with plasma generating voltages -- and an internal storage device --
it is pulse powered. The beam, totally effective IN ATMOSPHERE can be
loaded with hydrogen or oxygen. Range? Average, ground weapons -- maximum
two (2) Km if it is dry, capable of sustaining just so many full power
discharges -- slow leakage occurs continuously, therefore, they must be
recharged periodically. If it is raining the weapon becomes ineffective and
is swamped, thus discharged (this should be considered in any future
potential offensive strike against the base - Branton). The range is near
totally lost at that point.

"On the disks and saucers, the weapon is generally on the left side or top
center and has a maximum range of two hundred [200] meters at which point
it will plow a trench in desert soil. When fired -- it fires both to the
front and to the back equally. Reason? Because of their mode and methods of
flight. If equilibrium is not maintained, the saucer will spin out.

"Hand weapons? Estimate based upon visible damage observed, not too much
velocity nor staying power but at short range -- deadly [less than a .45
cal automatic]. (Note: This may explain the late Phil Schneider's claim
that at close range the radiation-beam weapons of the aliens he encountered
beneath Dulce were deadly, however at long range less so... although at
long range the beam weapons are capable of inducing severe radiation damage
- Branton). At one meter range, estimate of beam temperature 1600 degrees F
or higher; it can vaporize metal. Apparently the disks and weapons operate
from a storage source. In time, without periodic recharge, this source is
depleted. The design they traded to us was at least thirty years old --
employing an atomic source. Possibly they may still have some -- it would
appear so -- their staying power is obviously much longer.

"AIRCRAFT HELICOPTER VULNERABILITY: ANY of our aircraft, helicopters,
missiles or any AIR FLIGHT vehicle can be taken down instantly with no use
of weaponry. The alien simply need do no more than make one invisible pass
and their bow wave or screen or both will take the air lift vehicle down.
The pilot obviously will not even know what hit him (Perhaps Stealth type
fighters equipt with electromagnetic force shields may be more effective in
this regard... also advanced infrared scanners may be used to detect
'cloaked' alien ships before they have a chance to attack. - Branton).

"For humans on the ground, the alien can use weaponry or bow wave. The
partial pressure envelope can hit with the power of a tornado -- shock rise
time and G force is instantaneous. However, they dare not hit the craft
physically because they ARE fragile and in fact, under slow flying
conditions within our atmosphere, hold a very tenuous position. Without
power, the balance or equilibrium, they lose it.

"IN BRIEF -- THESE ARE APPARENT CAPABILITIES OBSERVED AND GLEANED THROUGH
THE COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND OBSERVATION. YOU MAY KNOW THESE, HOWEVER,
THEY ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LAST AND FINAL PORTION OF THIS REPORT.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

"1) Because of the alien's apparent logic system [they appear to be logic
controlled] A KEY DECISION CANNOT BE MADE WITHOUT HIGHER CLEARANCE. ALL ARE
UNDER THE CONTROL OF WHAT THEY CALL 'THE KEEPER'; YET IT WOULD APPEAR THIS
IS NOT THE FINAL SAY. THEREFORE, DEPENDENT UPON URGENCY, DELAYS OF AS LONG
AS TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HOURS CAN OCCUR FOR A DECISION. HOW SHORT/LONG THIS
TIME FRAME UNDER BATTLE CONDITIONS MAY BE, I DO NOT KNOW.

"Because of this apparent control, INDIVIDUAL INSTANTANEOUS DECISION MAKING
BY THE ALIEN IS LIMITED. IF THE 'PLAN' GOES EVEN SLIGHTLY OUT OF BALANCE OR
CONTEXT, THEY BECOME CONFUSED. Faced with this, possibly, the humanoids
would be the first to break and run.

"The same applies to their Mission MASTER PLAN, if one can call it that. IF
PUSHED OUT OF CONTEXT, IT WILL COME APART -- THEY WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE
WORLD SO THEY WILL POSSIBLY RUN BEFORE THEY FIGHT IN THE OPEN. THEY
DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

"Psychologically, at present, their morale is down -- near disintegration.
There is pronounced dissension in the ranks; even with the humanoids.
Communication can encourage this [not a necessity to expound upon this
other than to say BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INTERNAL VULNERABILITY MIND-WISE TO
EACH OTHER, THEREIN LIES A PRIME WEAKNESS]. Inter-echelon or individual
'trust' appears to be totally lacking so suspicion of each other is
rampant. They are highly segregated as to levels -- a 'low' dare not
conflict with a 'medium' or 'high' or it literally means death. Death
being, to the humanoid, deprogramming or, in the end perhaps total physical
death.

"THEY APPEAR TO BE TOTALLY DEATH ORIENTED and because of this, absolutely
DEATH-FEAR oriented. THIS IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE. The computer also
gives indications of a real possibility of adverse or 'ground programming'.

"2) Consider their ships -- most if not all run on charge. The source
depletes and so dependent upon size, depletion can occur from some within a
week or less. Ships can replenish each other but only up to charge balance.
This is done with antennae-like extensions and the charge is distributed
observing conservation of energy laws. THEY CAN REPLENISH FROM POWER LINES
-- BUT AGAIN ONLY TO A POINT -- so time of flight is limited. Deprived of
their base recharge capability, it is indicated that all ships will come
down within six months to a year unless they can get transported out --
that is back to the prime launch ship.

"The disks and saucers in general cannot fly in space because of their mode
of flight (i.e. unless they are within an interplanetary or interstellar
'launch' or 'carrier' vessel - Branton). Therefore, deprived of home base,
it is not likely they can survive. THEIR CAPABILITY IN POWER SURVIVAL
OUTLASTS THEIR CAPABILITY IN FOOD OR FORMULA SURVIVAL. IF THEY DO NOT GET
THE FORMULA/FOOD WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME THEY WILL WEAKEN AND DIE.

"IN THE CASE OF MT. ARCHULETA AND SOUTH PEAK, THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE
NAVAJO RIVER FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WATER TO THEM IS TOTALLY LIFE. WITHOUT
WATER THEY HAVE NO POWER; WITHOUT POWER, NO OXYGEN OR HYDROGEN TO SERVICE
THE SHIPS AND WEAPONS. NO WATER TO SUSTAIN THE ORGANS AND FEEDING FORMULA
(Note: We should also take into account the possibility of subterranean
water sources. Also, if the base can be weakened by shutting off the
supply-line of water, the 'formula', and so-on, it might be wise for the
sake of the humanoid 'prisoners' below not to wait until the base is too
weak, otherwise this might endanger these humans captives. We suggest that
in addition to the strategies that Bennewitz gives in this document, an
all-out under 'ground' invasion force should also be considered -- similar
to the "Tunnel Rats" of the Viet Nam war -- a force that is prepared to
enter the base when it is at a specific 'weak' point, and make strategic or
surgical 'kills' of enemy forces while still considering the human and
hu-brid captives. A multi-leveled operation utilizing surprise, confusion
and intimidation to their fullest potential should be considered... and the
sooner the better considering the continuous infiltration and sabotage of
all levels of our society. - Branton).

"Simple? Not really. However, THERE IS A WATER INTAKE AND THERE IS A DAM
UPSTREAM THAT CAN BE TOTALLY CUT OFF AND THE WATER RE-ROUTED TO CHAMA, NEW
MEXICO. SHOULD THIS OCCUR, AT LEAST THREE OF THE INTERNAL BASES WILL GO
DOWN. They could possibly go atomic periodically but obviously problems
without cooling.

"Once the bases are pressed on a large scale, all disks and saucers will go
airborne immediately. TROOPS ON THE GROUND CAN GAIN TERRAIN COVER TO QUITE
A DEGREE -- IT IS ROUGH TERRAIN.

"3) OUR NEED IS FOR A WEAPON, workable and preferably NOT like the alien's.
I believe unless the alien is caught unawares [with their screen up their
weapons are equal so they are like children pillow boxing] there can be no
result; THE WEAPON MUST PENETRATE THEIR SCREEN AND IT MUST ALSO PENETRATE
THE GROUND. I BELIEVE I HAVE THAT WEAPON (Note: Was this suggestion of
Bennewitz' for a 'ground-penetrating device', the original inspiration for
the Los Alamos 'Excalibur' weapon -- a nuclear device which was designed to
rapidly drill a hole through the earth and destroy 'aliens' in their
underground bases? - Branton). Two small prototypes have been funded and
constructed by my Company. Tests conducted to date indicate they do work
and work rather well considering their small size. Because of this weapon's
present status and proprietary nature [a basic patent is in process], the
theory will not be explained here. However, the weapon appears to do two
things at very low power. 1) The disks within it's range begin to discharge
when exposed to the weapon beam. To counteract, they must apply more power
and in so doing consume power. Again conservation of energy laws strictly
apply. (Note: Wilhelm Reich, whose research has been suppressed by certain
'interests', gained some level of success with a beam-weapon of this type.
Reich was able to 'discharge' the energy of UFO craft that had appeared
over his research facility, alien craft that were apparently curious of his
work in regards to his 'Orgon' energy powered 'cloudbuster' experiments. -
Branton)

"This effect can be observed on the detection instruments as they back away
in response to slow discharge. DISCHARGE, AT LOW POWER IS SLOW BUT AT HIGH
POWER IN THE FINAL SOPHISTICATED WEAPON, THE RATE CAN BE INCREASED BY MANY
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. 2) MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS WEAPON CAN PENETRATE THE
SCREEN -- HULL ALLOY, EVERYTHING. They cannot shield it in any way. Lastly,
BECAUSE OF THE IMPLANTS, THE WEAPON'S BEAM GETS TO THEM MENTALLY; THEY LOSE
JUDGMENT AND INDICATE ALMOST IMMEDIATE CONFUSION, PARTICULARLY THE
HUMANOIDS. (that is, the electromagnetic crystalline 'implants' that link
the aliens together into a collective mind or group intelligence. -
Branton)

"It is believed at this early stage -- based upon present testing -- that
the weapon when full on and full size will kill and bring down disks at
substantial range. The alien weapons operate substantially the same as
their disks using a charge source and charge distribution. So, in the same
sense it is indicated that this weapon design will pull their charge
weapons down very rapidly.

"The range of my weapon exceeds that of their present weapons and in its
most sophisticated form can be readily computer controlled to allow
extremely rapid tracking and lock-on regardless of speed along with
electronic wobbulation of the beam. IT IS A BEAM WEAPON and even at this
early stage of miniature prototype testing and development, it indicates
EVENTUAL superiority to their weapons.

"4) Initial logistics would indicate a plan sequentially implemented as
follows: This plan DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATORY SAFETY
MEASURES TO BE EMPLOYED BY GROUND FORCES; HOWEVER, IF AIR FORCE
INTELLIGENCE DESIRES TO PURSUE THE APPROACHES SUGGESTED IN THIS REPORT,
EACH SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN DEPTH.

"AN ATTACK MUST BE DIRECTED NEAR ENTIRETY ON THE GROUND FOR OBVIOUS
REASONS. One would, if familiar with the alien capability, indicate that
vehicle ignition problems will be encountered. This is precisely true;
however, the reason for this is not mysterious but is based upon good solid
laws of physics and are known. [From] experience gained through my study,
it is now known how to prevent this from happening and will be discussed in
detail at some later date. All electrical and electronic equipment must be
'hardened' using these specific techniques prior to implementation. Because
of the known capability of the alien [by use of scanning beams to know in
advance details of planning] only the initial outline is presented in this
report.

"Again through the communicative interaction (computer-linked
'interrogation' - Branton) with the alien, testing has simultaneously been
done upon this facet, i.e. eavesdropping and ways to abort this capability
have been tested and proven.

"The program would be instigated in phases. The first phase -- planning and
logistics -- would include continued implementation and testing of the
final weapon prototype through the pre-production stage. Production of at
least fifty minimum quality should be planned. Additional backup spares
should also be included.

"On a full time shift basis, it is estimated that at least one year or less
would be required to arrive at the pre-production stage. A team would be
organized by THUNDER SCIENTIFIC to accomplish this. The key work is now and
would be done by an associated company, BENNEWITZ LABS., LTD.

"Specific attack phases would be incorporated:

"1) The first procedure would be TO CLOSE THE GATES OF THE DAM ABOVE THE
NAVAJO RIVER. THIS DAM WOULD BE HELD CLOSED FOR THE DURATION. INTERNAL TO
THE ONE CAVE, THERE IS A SMALL DAM FOR WATER STORAGE. It's capacity is
small. THERE IS ALSO A DISCHARGE OUTLET DOWNSTREAM THAT COULD BE CLOSED
CAUSING WASTE WATER TO BACK-UP INTO THE CAVES. THE WATER IS VACUUM PUMPED
APPARENTLY BY SOME ELECTROSTATIC MEANS FROM THE RIVER. At close range, the
weapon will take out this capability.

"2) Once deprived TOTALLY of water for a minimum period of four weeks,
conditions in the alien bases under discussion will have badly
deteriorated. PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE WITH THE ALIEN;
total advantage can be taken by instantaneous action or planned observable
deviation from the norm. AT LEAST THREE BASES WILL GO DOWN.

"3) If they follow their normal strategic pattern as when pressed
previously, they will launch most if not all ships.

"4) Prior to the implementation of water deprivation, the weapons should be
deployed at strategic hardened locations and activated in a certain
pre-planned manner determined by final weapon coordinate locations.

"5) This will put an immediate power drain upon those airborne and the
alien weapons ringing their bases.

"6) Because of the inherent psychological aspect of the alien (Bennewitz
probably refers to 'the alien' in a singular sense because of the
'collective hive mind' nature of the Reptilian Grays - Branton), much can
be done in the open with no attempt to preserve secrecy. Much of what is
done can be of a diversionary nature. UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WILL
ATTEMPT TO HARASS BUT WILL NOT OPENLY ATTACK.

(Note: From my own personal experience and research, the Grays and other
members of the 'draconian hive' are more dependent on mental or
psychological warfare than on material warfare, although they have used
physical weaponry in the past when pushed into a corner -- as in airborne
assaults between their craft and ours or ground assaults against their
underground strongholds, as the 'Dulce' and 'Groom' wars themselves have
established. Being 'logic-based' they would prefer to take control of a
target planet by way of psychological infiltration without risking the loss
of machinery and personnel that would result from an attempted overt or
physical Invasion. An alien race would have to be extraordinarily
over-confident of their own superiority to undertake an all-out attack like
that depicted in the motion picture INDEPENDENCE DAY. As has reportedly
been the case with other targeted planets, the Reptiloids/Greys hold back a
physical attack until they have succeeded in infiltrating the targeted
planetary culture via Trojan-horse type interactions with some of the more
self-serving elements of that planet's culture. In the case of planet earth
the Nazified CIA and NSA agencies were chosen. These collaborators -- and
in many or most cases alien infiltrators, clones, cyborgs or 'implantees'
working within these agencies -- in turn set the inhabitants of the
targeted planet against each other so as to bring about world depopulation,
to the point where resistance to the invasional attack would be minimal.
The aliens usually seek out those eco-political cult leaders who would be
willing to 'sell out' their own world to the alien agenda in exchange for
promises of alien assistance in implementing a so-called joint-operational
dictatorship, one in which their own respective power cult[s] would
supposedly be the favored power structure once the planet is assimilated
and annexed to the alien empire. However if we are to consider the
historical trends of the alien collectivists, they may only favor this cult
until it has served its purpose. Following the establishment of the alien
agenda these power cultists might at best be totally mind-controlled and at
worst be eliminated, in that the 'alien' has no sense of honor or loyalty
to those with whom they have establish agreements -- they only have their
agenda and they will justify ANY course of action that best serves to bring
about that agenda. The human cultists would become so preoccupied about
establishing their own planetary empire, that they would blind themselves
to the fact that the aliens are merely USING them until such a time as
their usefulness has been served. However until that time they will USE the
human cultists to foment internal planetary sabotage and to infiltrate and
dis-able the major freedom-fighter or resistance movements from within.
There are three major 'collaboration' elements on earth -- the Bavarian
Lodges, the CIA-NSA-Rockefeller agencies, and the 'Nazi' forces within the
"New Berlin - 211" base network beneath the mountains of Neu Schwabenland,
Antarctica. Agents of the Bavarian Lodges AND the German-immigrant
Rockefellers DO work together within the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency],
NSA [National Security Agency], UNO [United Nations Organization], and NWO
[New World Order] agendas. The establishment of the Antarctic bases may
have been the idea of the highest-ranking Nazi's rather than the
Rockefellers, although the Bavarian lodges [Illuminati, Thule, Vril, etc.]
WERE involved, however there are many indications suggesting that the
Antarctican, Bavarian, and Rockefeller agendas are increasingly merging
with each other, suggesting that all three are now working together, at
least to some extent and especially at the higher levels. There seems to be
a "serpent cult" at work at the very highest levels of these three
groupings composed of humanoids and reptiloids operating as part of a
marriage of convenience, in that the Reptiloids/Grays need the
political-economic-social[ist]-military-industrial connections of the
humanoids to gain footholds within human society and the humanoids need the
implant/spacecraft/mind control technology to implement their "New World
Order". The lower levels of the Bavarian-NSA-Antarctican factions may seem
to be in conflict with each other, however where this exists it may all
amount to a Hegalian-Machievellian type manipulation imposed by the higher
levels of the Draconian hierarchy in order to keep the lower levels
compartmentalized and therefore more easily controlled. Occasional 'purges'
have been carried out to root-out those who are not 100 devoted to the
cause. In America there are fifth-column 'saboteurs' within the
Patriot-Militia movements who are the supporters of "White Supremacy
Americanism". Whether knowingly or unknowingly these agents work for
something called "The Order" [of the Fourth Reich]. Part of their mission
is to divert attention from the Draconian-Orion-Ashtarian and
Bavarian-NSA-Antarctican "New World Order" agenda and to an over-emphasized
'Zionist' threat based on the forged 'revelations' within the PROTOCOLS--OF
ZION document, which was in fact created by the Russian Secret Police for
this very diversionary purpose. There are indications that the Bavarian
occult lodges, the CIA-NSA agencies, and even the Antarctican factions have
fed the Patriot network with RACIST and therefore anti-American ideologies
meant to fragment and discredit the Militias and make them out to be
neo-Nazi fanatics. In this manner several of the patriotism-based militia
groups have been 'corrupted' and have defeated their very purpose, that is
to defend a Constitutional republic wherein "all men are created equal". -
Branton)

"7) Throughout and prior to this, the open computer communications link
will be operational for continued PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERROGATION.

"8) At some point in time -- again resting upon battle status, THE
DEPLOYMENT OF OFFENSIVE FORCES WILL BEGIN. This deployment should be done
in a near instantaneous manner under certain special conditions that can be
discussed.

"9) The weapon system should be kept powered up throughout. In this manner,
the disks will be made to stay airborne. They cannot land in the interval
the system is powered.

"10) When the weapon is used in one specific power mode, in addition to
continuous discharge on the disks that are airborne and the ground based
weapons, THE MIND CONFUSION AND DISORIENTATION WILL BUILD IN THOSE
PERSONNEL AT THE BASE AND UNDERGROUND. At the end of four to five weeks or
less, all weapons should be totally discharged and power out on the bases.
Most personnel if not all, will be totally incapacitated. THE FEEDING
FORMULA WILL BE DOWN AND IT'S CRITICAL PROCESSING RUINED. ALL [alien]
EMBRYOS SHOULD BE DEAD AND ALL HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN CONSUMABLES DEPLETED.
(Note: This is of course speaking in 'conventional' warfare terms, however
one must balance this by taking into account the psychic-supernatural
aspects of this conflict scenario as well. In such an event the chaplain
may be of as much importance as a commanding general himself, especially in
regards to reinforcing within ground troops the mental-spiritual attitude
necessary to counter the 'fear' projected by alien sorcerer and psychic
warfare specialists via occult-technology. Maintaining a state of absolute
confidence and 'faith' in one's ability to establish a victory over the
aliens is essential in that if one's confidence is broken as a result of
psychic attack, then it would be very difficult to even make an attempt to
follow through to final victory... the battle is already lost. Other
possibilities should also be considered in a future assault on this major
Nexus of alien activity. For instance, if the extent of the base is much
deeper and wide-spread then previously believed -- via interconnected
caverns and shuttle terminals -- then these facts should be brought into
the scenario as well. For instance the 'aliens' might escape 'through the
tubes' to other installations. Even if this does occur this major basing
complex can be fully taken by human forces, and then used as a 'staging'
area to initiate attacks -- in alliance with other humanoid cultures
'below' or 'above' who are also at war with the 'Draconian Collectivist'
Reptiloids and Grays -- against their various strongholds which undoubtedly
exist throughout the 'inner realms'. - Branton)

"11) Based upon data gathered on the miniature prototype weapons, the full
power weapons should have no problem holding off the disks. In many cases
some will break within the first forty-eight hours without being directly
hit.

"12) At that point, standard weapon technology and logistics can come into
play and [be] used to the extent of destruction desired at the direction of
those in charge.

"13) The communications can be used throughout to determine status and near
the end to attempt to instigate surrender. If no response results, then
they should simply be closed in and waited out.

"SUMMARY -- It is important to note that the initial implementation of the
computer communications WAS NOT INSTIGATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF TALKING TO
THE ALIEN FOR THE 'FUN OF IT'; BUT WAS DELIBERATELY INSTIGATED TO USE AS A
TOOL TO STUDY, IN DEPTH -- LONG TERM WITHOUT PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION -- THE
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE ALIEN.

"The weapon theory and prototypes were built to capitalize upon and test
two KEY and prominent weaknesses discovered. This in-house funded program
has been expensive, in excess of $200,000; done ON BEHALF OF OUR NATION and
handled in the best representative manner humanly possible.

"1) The PRIME and weakest area discovered, probed and tested is exactly
what they have used thinking it is their key strength -- that being THE
MANIPULATION OF AND CONTROL OF THE MIND; NOT ONLY OF COMMAND BUT ALSO
HUMANOID. MANIPULATED IN REVERSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND BY THE LANGUAGE
[COMPUTER] AND DUE TO THE EXTREME OF MENTAL DISTORTION AND INCAPACITY
CAUSED BY THE WEAPON, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THIS FACET IS FOR THEM A
DISASTER AND A DIRECTLY VULNERABLE INTEGRATED WEAKNESS.

"2) Though their ships are magnificent, they are also weak -- solely
BECAUSE of their method and unique mode of flight. They do not have a
stable fighting platform (Note: The effectiveness of stable-flying
conventional jet aircraft ARMED with advanced beam weaponry has been
confirmed by the 'South African Incident' -- which was investigated by
QUEST INTERNATIONAL, a British UFO research organization made-up of former
police, security and military officials. The incident involved a UFO that
was reportedly intercepted using an experimental aircraft-mounted THOR-II
laser cannon. The weapon was fired and several blinding flashes were seen
by the attacking Mirage-jet pilot, and the disc crashed at high speed into
the desert sands of the Kalahari. The craft was brought to a South African
base and using hydraulic equipment the 'door' was opened and two blue-gray
aliens with reptilian features staggered out and were apprehended. When one
doctor attempted to take a blood sample from one of the creatures, the
being attacked him and its claw-like hands left deep scratches on his face
and chest. The aliens proved to be rather vicious and seemed to operate on
an individual-collective intelligence mode. Subsequent research suggested a
possible genetic connection 'similar' to that of the early bi-pedal saurian
species on earth according to one leaked document, and that the aliens were
highly adaptable or mutational. In the event of jet-mounted beam weapons
however, the PROBLEM would be our ability to determine whether these craft
are friends or foes! The QUEST INTERNATIONAL officials have revealed
sufficient evidence to prove that either the event DID happen OR that the
international intelligence community had collaborated in a massive and
expensive UFO hoax. Either way, the implications are provocative. -
Branton). Charge distribution CAN also be discharged. The weapon does this
-- even in it's present miniature prototype state.

"IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT TO IMPLY THAT THE OVERALL PROBLEM
WILL BE SOLVED WITH THE CAPTURE OF THESE BASES. Obviously IT WILL NOT, but
it is a firmly based beginning with a high degree of rated projected
success ratio. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY THE ALIEN WILL NOT FIGHT; THEY
MAY -- THOUGH THEIR INCLINATION IS GENERALLY THE OPPOSITE -- THIS BASING
AREA IS KEY! WITHOUT IT, THEIR MISSION IS IN VERY DEEP TROUBLE. It is noted
that these are not the only bases on earth. There ARE others. With a
conservative estimate using typical logistic support numbers, it is not
unrealistic to say there are 50,000 aliens (at the very least - Branton)
within the ecosphere of earth and near space.

(Note: Even IF this basing nexus is captured by U.S. Constitutional forces
and a large percentage of the underground 'joint-operational' agenda is
forced from the underground networks of the U.S.A., it is very likely that
they would NOT retreat to other planets, but would instead retreat to their
more ancient underground strongholds in other parts of the world. This
would not necessarily end the activities of the serpent cult [the
humanoid-reptiloid collaboration] on earth, but it would provide a BASE
from which future atrocities of the 'serpent cult' may be battled on,
below, and beyond planet earth. Such an action would no doubt provoke a
negative response from other human power-centers on planet earth that are
also being manipulated by and/or have been infiltrated by the aliens, for
instance the Bavarian cults and their "New World Order" forces. The
draconians might, as suggested in the 12th chapter of the book of
Revelation, attempt a military attack against the U.S.A. in order to
prevent the takeover of "their" underground fortresses here -- or an attack
after the fact in retaliation for such a take-over. The important thing to
remember however is that freedom NEVER comes without a price... HOWEVER THE
PRICE FOR MAINTAINING OUR FREEDOM IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PRICE WE WILL
HAVE TO PAY FOR LOSING IT!!! Remember, no matter WHAT trials America must
pass through in the future in her efforts to maintain freedom, liberty and
individuality from the forces of collectivist tyranny, WE MUST NEVER FORGET
THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS 'WAR' WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT NOT ONLY ON
THE FUTURE OF THIS PLANET BUT ALSO ON THE FUTURE OF ALL OF THE COLONIAL
WORLDS WITHIN THIS GALAXY WHO ARE INTENTLY LOOKING TOWARDS PLANET EARTH AND
ESPECIALLY AMERICA -- WHICH IS THE 'EPICENTER' OR STAGING-GROUND FOR THE
LATEST BATTLE BETWEEN THE HUMAN 'FEDERATION' AND THE REPTILOID 'EMPIRE' --
TO SEE JUST WHICH WAY THE BATTLE WILL TURN. According to several contactees
many Federation forces and personnel from the Andromeda and Pleiades
constellations, and also from Tau Ceti, Procyon and other star systems, are
so absolutely devoted to their belief in non-interventionism that they have
blockaded our Sol system from Draconian-Orionite interventionists who would
take advantage of this critical and unstable time in earth's history [the
close of the 20th century] to claim yet another treasure planet -- perhaps
the most strategic planet of all -- for their empire. This would have a
devastating impact on all of the Federation worlds, since this planet and
all its chemical-mineral-plant-animal-liquid-genetic-etc., resources could
be used as a staging world for Draconian attack against other Federation
worlds. As this is being written, Federation Personnel are fighting and
dying near the outskirts of our Sol system, according to Contactee Alex
Collier and others, in order to prevent this from happening and to prevent
continued 'intervention' in the affairs of planet earth by the various
galactic vermin, scum, parasites, and filth that have poisoned and
destroyed countless human colonial worlds throughout this galaxy and
possibly others. No matter what trials we as Americans must pass through in
the future in order to defend our nation and our planet from the draconians
and their ungodly human "New World Order" collaborators, NEVER forget that
we are not only fighting for our families, our communities, our states, and
our nation. We are also fighting for our planet, our star system, and for
OUR GALAXY! - Branton)

"Some of us will be lost in the endeavor that is obvious -- however, done
NOW the advantage is gained along with new additional technology to prepare
for the next stage.

"The key to overall success is -- they TOTALLY respect FORCE. And with
them, the most effective method is to stubbornly continue to pick and pull
at their defense WITH NO LETUP. Faced with the total loss of a base that
has taken YEARS to construct, it is believed that their mission WILL be
grossly weakened and badly slowed.

"As Americans, in this particular instance, we MUST realize that we in this
case cannot rely upon our inherent moral principles to provide the answer.
Negotiation IS OUT. This particular group can only be dealt with NO
DIFFERENTLY than one must deal with a mad dog. THAT method they understand.

(This has led some to suggest that the only way to deal with the Grays is
through direct force and threat of death. That is, to demand unconditional
surrender of their forces to ours and threaten their destruction if they do
not comply. It is possible, according to some contactees, that certain of
the reptilian life-forms can be tamed -- that is IF they are somehow
disconnected from the alien collective-hive mind. This would be especially
true with the genetic 'hybrids' and especially those hybrids who possess a
human soul-matrix. Even if they surrender, those aliens that are truly
non-human -- that is, no soul -- can NEVER be allowed to work and operate
on an equal basis with other humans, but must EVER remain subservient and I
would personally suggest prevented from reproducing after their kind, since
they do not possess the integral 'conscience' necessary, of their own
initiative, to overcome their base animal or predatory instincts or drives.
For those who may disagree, just look at the known history of the
Reptiloids/Greys in their dealings with human beings. One should not be
mislead by the apparent "superiority of intelligence" of the Greys, since
their intelligence is a direct result of the collective mind. Without the
'collective' hive and operating on their own they are mentally inferior to
human beings, at least on an individual basis. The Greys have told some
individuals that they are 'legally' here on earth and in America because of
the 'treaties'. Did they 'legally' implant numerous influential men and
women with mind control devices against their conscious will? Did they
'legally' and permanently abduct untold thousands of men, woman and
children to their underground bases? Are they 'legally' mutilating and
stealing our livestock? Did an elected Congress 'legally' agree to these
treaties -- or was it an Executive branch of government which has appointed
numerous UNELECTED personnel and agencies, in many cases hirlings of
unelected corporate-military agendas, who in turn have established
'treaties' with an alien force or forces? Just how 'legal' is the U.S.
presidency anyway, following the death of John F. Kennedy, IF Lyndon
Johnson was an accomplise in a fascist coup d'etat of the Executive branch
of the U.S. government in 1963? Were any of the Corporate-CFR-TLC
'presidential' hirelings who came into office following this Executive coup
d'etat 'legal'? Were their Executive Orders, for instance those connected
with FEMA which 'authorize' the destruction of the U.S. Constitution in the
event of a 'national emergency', 'legal'? Or could it be that such
Executive Orders are not worth the TOILET PAPER they are written on? The
fact is that the Greys, with the help of their mind-controlled human zombie
collaborators, HAVE INVADED OUR COUNTRY, OUR AIRSPACE, AND HAVE UNDERMINED
OUR LANDS, and they are freely VIOLATING the personal and mental integrity
of our people against their conscious consent. - Branton).

Therefore, in ELIMINATING this threat, we most certainly cannot be called
the 'aggressor', because we HAVE literally been invaded.

In final conclusion, A) They CANNOT under ANY circumstances be trusted. B)
They are totally deceptive and death oriented and have no moral respect for
human or human life. C) NO NEGOTIATION, AGREEMENT nor PEACEFUL COMPROMISE
can be settled upon in any way. D) NO agreement signed by both parties will
EVER be adhered to NOR recognized and respected by the alien, though they
might attempt to make us believe otherwise. E) ABSOLUTELY NO QUARTER can be
allowed under ANY circumstances. Once the offense is instigated, it cannot
be abandoned. If it is, reciprocal reprisal will immediately result. They
must be made to come down -- destruct themselves which is a standing order
if the ship is failing or leave earth immediately -- NO leeway of any kind
can be allowed or tolerated."



For those of you who would question the need to take the offensive against
the Reptiloid/Gray strongholds at Dulce and elsewhere, let me just remind
you of the kind of alien mentality we are dealing with here by relating the
following three incidents:



According to well-known Ufologist Brad Steiger, in the book THE RAINBOW
CONSPIRACY, co-authored with his wife Sherry Steiger, a terrifying incident
occurred in 1955. This was one of SEVERAL reports of UFO attacks against
civilians, civilian airlines and military planes and jets that were
documented in the book. In many cases many notorious airline crashes were
accompanied by UFO activity reported by witnesses just prior to the
disasters or disappearances. Usually there are few actual witnesses to
aircraft related 'disasters' or 'disappearances', however in this
particular case there was.

A civilian pilot and his friend were engaged in some prospecting projects
near the headwaters of the Agua River near the city of Prescott, Arizona.
The two men SWORE that they had observed two brightly lit UFOs attack a
military plane as it directed "some kind of strange beams" at the aircraft,
causing it to explode.

Worse yet, according to the civilian pilot and his friend, when both of the
airmen ejected from the doomed and burning aircraft and began floating down
to the ground in their parachutes, the UFOs swung back around and seared
the survivors with the same deadly rays, apparently killing them both.



In an article titled, 'INCREDIBLE UFO INCINERATION'S: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF
THE COMBUSTIBLE KIND', researcher Larry E. Arnold describes the following
terrifying encounters:

...Of the many episodes involving UFOs and the spontaneous combustion of
humans, quite probably the most disastrous event [if true] in MODERN times
occurred to the African village of Kirimukuya on Mt. Kenya.

For several nights in June 1954, young Laili Thindu and his shepherd
companions listened to the pounding of their neighbors' drums announcing a
wedding about to take place on the mountainside. They also watched STRANGE
LIGHTS soar around this 'sacred' peak in central Kenya. They naturally were
startled when bright beams flashed from these soaring lights, then
concerned that the drums were now silent.

The next morning Laili learned that 'all the dancers, all the children, all
the livestock, -- the entire population of the village -- had been seared
to death by terrible streams of light from glowing objects,' report Brad
Steiger and Joan Whritenour in their book , FLYING SAUCERS ARE HOSTILE. 'It
was not until Laili Thindu ventured into Nairobi that he was able to tell
his story to someone who recognized the tale for what it really was: the
annihilation of an African village by a UFO..."



In the Spring 1991 issue of UFO JOURNAL OF FACTS, Forest Crawford, a
researcher for the well-known MUFON aerial phenomena research organization,
related his personal encounters and conversations with a man he identified
only as 'Oscar', who was involved in UFO crash/retrieval projects in
earlier years. Oscar stated that on one occasion he and his team recieved
an assignment to investigate a disc that had crashed near Phoenix, Arizona
and was then transported to an underground base in North Dakota. The team
descended into the deeper levels of the COMTRAPAC submarine base in San
Diego where high-security OSS personnel directed them to a tube-like
shuttle. Entering the shuttle they prepared to "shoot the tubes", and
eventually emerged into the lower levels of the North Dakota base.

Once they arrived, they were told that they would not be allowed to visit
the surface of the base during their stay. 'Oscar' viewed the disc which
had originally held a crew of three human-like pilots. Two were found
outside the craft dead from radiation exposure and other injuries, whereas
another was found in an injured state within the secured conditions inside
the craft after the team had succeeded in opening it using a sonic
resonator. The operation was initially carried out under the direction of
Commander Charles Turner, a friendly man who Oscar got along with well.
However without warning another high-ranking officer who everyone feared
and who did not appear friendly at all came on the scene. He stated that he
was now in charge and began ordering all kinds of experiments and
exploratory surgeries on the humanoid -- who was still alive -- in spite of
the fact that the anethsesia had little or no affect on him. Some samples
of his organs were also removed for study.

The new man in charge was Frank Drake, who later became involved with the
OZMA and SETI radio-dish experiments, which had initially pointed their
dishes at Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani and began receiving intense signals
suggesting intelligent life. These initial reports were a mistake or
irrelevant according to Frank Drake and his colleagues, and nothing
remarkable resulted 'publicly' from the SETI project -- 'officially' that
is -- however this and similar projects continue to recieve a great deal of
funding supplied by the loyal American taxpayer. Drake named the
disc-recovery research project OSMA [with an 'S'], and continued to torment
the humanoid with various surgical procedures until he finally died. Oscar
had given the humanoid the nickname 'Hank', which was an Amerindian word
meaning 'troubled spirit'. According to Forest Crawford, before the
humanoid died, 'Oscar' had learned several interesting things from other
researchers on his team as well as from the humanoid himself, who had
projected images and messages to Oscar via some form of
telepathic-empathic-visual-encephalographic wave transfer. The 'man' was
approximately 5' 8" tall, of humanplike Meso-American or Mediterranean
appearance yet with a face and nose that was slightly 'broader' than the
average earth-person, muscular yet not fat -- however he was somewhat
heavier for his size than earth people, suggesting that his planet of
origin possessed gravity somewhat greater than earth's. Crawford stated:

...The pattern from the panel inside the ship was confirmed by 'Rapp' to
match stars of the constellation Eridanus as seen FROM EARTH. It was later
confirmed by Hank that the stars of origin of his people were Tau Ceti and
Epsilon Eridani. In later sessions Oscar discussed some reasons for the
presence of the aliens. He said THEY DO NOT LIKE THE SITUATION WITH SOME OF
THE SMALL GREY ALIENS... ('Hank' also stated that the particular group of
aliens that his people most often encountered were the gray-whites, which
are apparently a genetically engineered reptiloid-insectoid hybrid race. -
Branton). The Tau Cetians feel that the abductions being carried out by
some of the Greys ARE A GREAT INJUSTICE TO HUMANITY. 'THEY ARE A PARASITIC
RACE THAT HAS AND IS PREYING ON HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
UNIVERSE,' Oscar relayed. He added that our government's involvement with
the grays IS VERY DANGEROUS AND OUT OF CONTROL... Oscar is ADAMANT that
[they] are using HUMAN FLUIDS FOR SUSTENANCE. They feed by immersing their
arms in vats and/or rubbing the fluids on their bodies. HE CLAIMS THAT THEY
ARE ALSO KIDNAPPING CHILDREN. The Tau Cetians have been preyed upon by
these aliens before and they are working with other races and communities
that were also victims. ONE SUCH RACE THAT OSCAR CLAIMS WAS RUN OFF THEIR
HOME PLANET BY THE BUG PEOPLE [Hanks definition of these aliens, because of
their partly insectoid nature and parasitical character] WAS WHAT WE NOW
CALL THE NORDICS OR PLEIADIANS. He claims, because of his ongoing contacts,
he was made aware of the Billy Meier case in Switzerland and swears that is
a real contact...

(Note: Others claim that the Meier contacts and photos are faked, however
they may not have been aware of the fact that some of the very first
skeptical investigators who came to Meier attempted to see if they could
reproduce the photos by making their own models and taking pictures of
them. Several of these models and the photos were given to Meier -- the
exact motive for doing so is not known. However, later investigators saw
these 'models' in Meier's home and took some of the faked photos that the
initial investigators had left with Meier, found the hidden 'strings'
through photo analysis, and came to the 'logical' conclusion. Was Meier
"set up" or was it just one big misunderstanding? Other evidence tends to
confirm Meier's claims, including other eye-witnesses to unusual UFO
activity, photo's of UFO's passing behind trees, motion picture footage,
and so on. - Branton)

I find all these comments interesting especially when you consider one
investigative detail of this case. I have seen Oscar's house, his Mother's
house, his work shop and truck, and at no time were any books, magazines,
transcripts or movies about any subject, let alone recent UFO material,
found... Could he be an avid reader of the latest and most controversial
UFO documents and just be hiding them when we come over? This is highly
unlikely since, without a phone, our visits were always unannounced.

...[Oscar, who has since had subsequent contacts with Tau Cetians] wants
people to know that if they are contacted by the Tau Cetians [humans such
as he described] to not be afraid because they are here to help."
