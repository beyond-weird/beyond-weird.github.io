DULCE NEW MEXICO & THE DRACONIAN CONNECTION





The following is taken from an article by TAL LeVesque, titled 'THE COVERT
RETURN OF AN ALIEN SPECIES OF REPTILIAN HERITAGE -- THE DULCE BASE,' which
appeared in a mailer-newsletter distributed by researcher Patrick
O'Connell:



According to TAL, ages ago "...a CONFLICT with other beings, ELs [human
giants] destroyed most of the Reptoid civilization, which forced some into
deep caverns & others to leave earth -- to Alpha Draconis and/or Altair in
the constellation Aquila, which in ancient lore was associated with evil
reptilian creatures... The conflict is a Species War, between the Evadamic
Seed & the 'Serpent' [draconian] Seed.

(Note: Contactee Maurice Doreal claims to have learned from people he had
encountered who came from the subterranean 'Agharti' colonies below North
America and Asia, that these giants were closely allied with a race of
pre-Scandinavian Nordics who maintained a powerful and scientifically
developed civilization whose remains now lie beneath tons of sand in the
ancient Gobi desert region of Asia. Doreal was told how both the giants and
blond people had waged a prehistoric war against a race of Antarctic-based
reptiloids, which they succeeded in driving from the surface of the planet
during the ancient conflict. - Branton)

"Under cover of darkness, with bases hidden inside the earth, this
nocturnal invader has chosen to reclaim what was once theirs & use it, and
us, as a staging area in their ancient conflict with the 'ELs'.

(Note: That is, to reclaim that which these serpent races WANT US TO
BELIEVE was once theirs. The 'ELs' are the so-named EL-der race, a human
branch tied-in with the Evadamic heritage yet who had attained to or had
retained a very tall physical stature averaging from 9-12 ft. in height.
Others have referred to them as the 'Anakim' or the 'Nepheli'. - Branton)

"Humans with alien brain implants [the 'zombies'] have been programmed to
help overthrow Mankind in the NEAR FUTURE. The 'Reptoids' are even able TO
TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO BEINGS WITH HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS & FEATURES. The
planet Earth is being stressed so that human resistance will be minimal,
during the overt takeover & control of Mankind.

"It started as a 'joint interaction program.' An Alien Species wanted to
'share' parts of it's advanced technology with certain humans in KEY
POSITIONS OF POWER within government, military, corporations, 'secret
societies', etc... The population as a whole began to be manipulated into
the 'Alien Agenda'... they wanted TOTAL CONTROL of us!

"...[Former Dulce Base Security Officer Thomas Castello] had seen tall
Reptilian Humanoids at the base. This is interesting to me [TAL] because in
1979 I came face-to-face with the over 6 foot tall 'Other' Species
[REPTOIDS] which materialized in our home! They took blood from my wife
[who is an Rh-negative blood type]; & her daughter, who was 1500 miles
away.

"...We all came to know that the 'Visitors' were here to stay. We also
learned how the Reptilian Race was RETURNING to Earth & the 'Greys' [who
are mercenaries] WERE BEING USED to interface [with] & manipulate hu-mans.
Their DEMONIC AGENDA was to keep earth surface [man] CONFUSED & unaware of
their true nature & potential... ALSO THE KNOWLEDGE OF VAST & VARIED
CIVILIZATIONS LIVING WITHIN THE EARTH.

"The Fantastic Truth was made to seem a fantasy, a legend, a myth, an
illusion! The REPTOIDS are RETURNING to earth to use it as a staging area,
in their ANCIENT CONFLICT with the Elohim (the angelis

forces of the Almighty Creator, as well as the Nepheli who were not angels
as some believe but actual humans of tall stature who in ancient times were
undeservingly worshipped as 'gods'. - Branton) The ADAMIC Race has
underground bases within Mars -- they are a 'Warrior Cult' culture.

"...There is a vast network of Tube Shuttle connections, under the U.S.,
which extends into a GLOBAL SYSTEM OF TUNNELS & SUB-CITIES... Note: The
reptilians DO NOT consider them-selves 'Aliens'... they claim Terra [3rd
from the Sun] was their home before we humans 'arrived'.

"...As a species," TAL continues, "the reptilian heritage beings [the
Greys, Reptoids, Winged Draco with 2 horns -- the classic stereotype of the
'Devil']... are highly analytical & technologically oriented. They are
seriously into the sciences of automation [& computers] & bio-engineering
[& genetics]! However, their exploits in these areas has led to reckless
experimentation, WITH TOTAL DISREGARD FOR ETHICS [moral standards] AND
EMPATHY. This is also true of MANY OF THE HUMAN BEINGS WORKING WITH THEM!"

(Note: In reference to the "Winged Draco", which are considered to be near
the top of the alien hierarchy, above the tall "Lizard Men" and the short
'Grays', these have also gone by the following titles: the Mothmen,
Gargoyles, Winged Serpents, Pterodactoids, Ciakars or Birdmen. They seem to
be exclusively deep-subterranean dwellers yet have been known to appear
during massive UFO - Men In Black - Abduction waves such as that which
passed through the Point Pleasant area of West Virginia as recorded in John
Keel's book THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, which suggested a possible subterranean
connection near an old TNT storage area in the vicinity. The two other
areas where these winged reptilians have been most often reported are of
course below Dulce, New Mexica and also within the 8-levelled underground
system beneath Camp Hero near Montauk Point, Long Island where a joint Nazi
[American Corporate & European Militant Nazi's], Gray, and Reptiloid base
exists... one that reportedly connects to the ITT center in New Jersey. The
common denominator would be the German Krupp family who built munitions
plants for Adolph Hitler and not only maintains a large percentage of
control over ITT but also helped to finance the 'Montauk'
time-space-mind-control projects for the Bavarian Thule Society, which are
continuing within the M.A.L.T.A. or Montauk-Alsace-Lorraine-Time-Archives
facility within the Alsace-Lorraine Mts. near the French-German border. The
Alsace-Lorraine regions were taken from France in the Franco-Prussian war
of the previous century and later returned to France by the Allies
following the end of W.W.II. The MALTA base 'may' lie under the German
territory near the border, however if it happens to lie under French soil,
this may be because the base is located in one of the underground
facilities constructed by the Nazi's during, before or just following
W.W.II, a facility that the French did not discover following the return of
the region following the war. As for the ITT center in New Jersey, it also
reportedly has a connection to the national-international Sub-Global
network, according to Al Bielek. Very rarely are the "winged draco"
encountered on UFO's, and although at times they have been seen flying at
night or in the day through the air as in the Point Pleasant
manifestations, they seem to operate most often within the deepest
underground levels where the Grays and Reptiloids themselves have been
known to converge. - Branton)



TAL then describes something which might seem unbelievable if it were not
for the fact that dozens of other sources tend to confirm the same thing.
This discovery was reportedly one of the REAL REASONS for the initiation of
the 'Dulce Wars':



"...LEVEL #7 is the worst. Row after row of 1,000's of humans &
human-mixture remains in cold storage. Here too are embryos of humanoids in
various stages of development. Also, many human childrens' remains in
storage vats. Who are [were] these people?"



(Note: During a lecture given to THE PROPHECY CLUB, Japanese researcher of
the Area 51 and Dulce enigmas -- Norio Hayakowa -- quoted the following
statement that appeared in a 1992 issue of THE ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL: "...WHY
NEW MEXICO HAS SO MANY MORE MISSING CHILDREN THAN COMPARABLE STATES REMAINS
A MYSTERY." - Branton)



The sources for these incredibly disturbing allegations aside from Thomas
Castello himself, according to TAL, included:



"...people who worked in the labs, abductees taken to the base, people who
assisted in the construction, intelligence personnel [NSA, CIA, etc.], and
UFO-Inner Earth researchers."

This information, TAL states, "is meant for those who are seriously
interested in the Dulce base. FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION, be advised to 'USE
CAUTION' while investigating this complex."
