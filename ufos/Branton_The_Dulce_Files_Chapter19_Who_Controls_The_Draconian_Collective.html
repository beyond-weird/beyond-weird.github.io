WHO CONTROLS THE DRACONIAN COLLECTIVE?





The following chapter is based upon some thoughts and questions that had
been forming in my mind for some time, until many of these questions were
answered when I discovered an interesting volume titled COSMIC VOYAGE, by
Mr. Courtney M. Brown, Ph.D. This work deals with the authors' personal
experiments with remote viewing, along with his trainer Ed Dames, a former
remote-viewer for U.S. Military Intelligence who taught Courtney Brown the
secret military "R.V." or "Astral-Magnetic body" viewing techniques which
he himself had learned as a member of the military psi corps.

From my own perspective, remote viewing operates through the subspace body
of a human being who is able to tap-in to the universal psionic field.
Since the psionic field is the very foundation of all space-time-material
reality, the so-called "master program" of the universe which is made up of
a 'field' of psionic or thought-form energy, it is not necessarily bound by
the limits of space, time and matter. The psionic energy field seems to be
interwoven into the electromagnetic grid structure of all gravitational
bodies, with the electro-magneto-gravitic fields of those bodies serving as
psionic 'traps' for thought-forms which are essentially the psychic
'residue' of all thinking beings, and in turn the accumulated "memory
matrix" of those gravitational planetary bodies.

These psionic fields contain THOUGHT ENERGY. Now thoughts can either be
based on truth or on deception, so just because this "thought-form energy"
has accumulated within the gravitational grid structure of a planet -- FROM
the time that thinking entities begin interacting with a gravitational
sphere -- this does not mean that the information which has been
'programmed' into these psionic "thought-emotion energy" fields is always
true. Reality, imagination, truth, and deception based thought-forms are
all 'recorded' ir-regardless of their content within these
electro-magneto-gravitic energy grids, just as one might record information
within a multi-layered crystal via laser technology. Supposing one had the
appropriate sophisticated technology, they could 'bleed' a wall, a rock, or
any other object of its thought forms, sounds, or visual vibrations which
have accumulated within that object over the years. They could literally
'read' the past through these objects.

Like a bio-chemical radio transceiver, some individuals -- for better or
for worse -- seem to have the ability to 'tune-in' to and 'surf' the
'universal consciousness', the 'flowline', or the 'Akasha' memory matrix
which links all thinking entities together on the deepest levels of the
unconscious, allowing them to travel to specific places in space and time.
You could say that CONSCIOUS awareness is composed of neural "short waves"
which are localized with the individual, however UNCONSCIOUS awareness is
composed of neural "long-waves" that reach beyond the individual -- for
instance the neural states that are active during dreaming, thus explaining
why many have reported experiencing "shared dreams" with other people. You
could liken neuro-psionic activity to an ocean. On the 'surface' are
islands representing individual third-dimensional consciousness, however
the deeper one goes the more the thought-forms merge with each other, just
as the sunken earth beneath the islands eventually connects to other
islands at the deeper levels, representative of a collective unconscious
where the thought forms of thinking creatures merge into one 'reservoir'.

One of the 'targets' to which Mr. Brown's military RV trainer sent him was
the Grey aliens' collective mind, and more specifically he was instructed
to search out the ultimate command or control center of the collective.

Shortly after this particular experiment began [one of many], Brown found
himself in an area where several Greys were working, although he did not
know exactly where this was. He 'followed' the collective mind or
thought-flow and found it to be absolutely massive, giving him the feeling
of something unbounded, and almost universal in nature. However, he did
detect a center, a definite 'heartbeat' of this massive collective matrix,
into which and out from which a steady stream of information was flowing.

He noticed, at one point, an unusual 'subspace' being that seemed to be
directing the activities of the Greys he was observing, and discovered that
the bodies of the Greys themselves were incarnated by such 'subspace'
beings which apparently entered the Greys' embryonic bodies and used them
as vessels to manipulate physical reality.

Brown was then instructed to locate other of these beings who apparently
controlled the Grey collective from a subspace or astral level, and found
himself in an area where several of these subspace or paraphysical entities
were located. As he continued towards this 'center' the number of subspace
or non-corporeal beings increased until he came to a place of much
activity, something like a grand central station type of area, where these
beings were very active in various pursuits. He did not know exactly where
this was, but noticed that the closer he came to the control 'center' the
more he sensed an increasing rigid atmosphere of absolute military-like
control. He came to what he sensed was the central governing center of the
subspace beings' activity, and in the center of this there was another area
where a "council of 10" very high-level subspace or paraphysical entities
congregated. These were apparently the governing principalities who were
engaged in running the whole operation. The security here was absolutely
incredible.

Then he perceived the SUPREME LEADER of this council of 10 paraphysical
entities... and at about this point Courtney Brown was jerked back into his
body, so to speak. He sensed that this leader had detected the presence of
his own subspace, astral or magnetic body which he had projected, and had
followed this RV 'intruder' back to his physical source. Brown and his
trainer felt an oppressive, dark 'cloud' enter the room and it stayed there
for about half a minute scrutinizing the scene. It left, apparently seeing
the two RV'ers as "small frys" who were not worth wasting its time on.

Before Brown's expulsion from the command center however, he was able to
perceive for a brief moment what this being was really like. He or it was
an extremely powerful being, but one with a twisted personality that was
full of darkness. Apparently this being had come into conflict with another
Force which it saw as its enemy. Brown sensed within this being a severe
self-esteem problem, in spite of its incredible power, and because of this
it had a consuming desire to be worshipped by others. Brown was confused
when he sensed that these subspace beings, and in turn the
Reptilians/Greys, were actually COMMANDED by this leader to engage in
self-indulgent and destructive activities. This being apparently wanted his
servants to use self-indulgent rewards or fear of punishment to maintain
the absolute hierarchical command structure within its empire -- as well as
through the rest of the subspace hierarchy, and in turn throughout the
Reptilian Grey's collective 'hive' society that they completely infested.

Brown also got the impression that it was FEAR and PRIDE -- its perceived
NEED to be worshipped -- that kept this being from negotiating with its
ancient enemy, and that this being was utterly desperate to maintain its
very survival or existence [strange for a seemingly immortal subspace
being] and chose to resort to rebellion and terrorism in a desperate
attempt to take control of the situation. Brown recieved a strong
impression that this being was the ultimate universal terrorist!!!
Apparently because of its all-consuming ego this being would NEVER humble
itself before its 'enemy', and the same might be said for most of the upper
echelon of the hierarchy who depended on the praise of their fellow
collaborators to maintain their illusion of self-importance.

These beings, one might say, had long ago and of their own free-agency
'imploded' in upon themselves -- becoming 'spiritual black holes' with
all-consuming appetites, absolute astral vampirial-like parasites, having
extinguished all 'light' within themselves and therefore being unable to be
brought back "into the light". Incapable of giving out 'light', they have
become totally reprobate, devouring any and all life and innocence around
them that they can possibly consume. The leader of this subspace
'collective' had long ago drawn these other dark beings into itself, like a
large black star devouring other smaller ones around it. This irreversible
state MIGHT not apply entirely to ALL of these "subspace" beings, as we
will see later on.

Now if we go to the book of Revelation, chapter 12, we find that the
ultimate leader of the serpent race's collective or 'hive mind' is Lucifer,
also known as the "great red dragon", the "old serpent", "the Devil" or
"Satan" in the same chapter. Lucifer was one of the three original
archangels [aside from Michael and Gabriel] who each apparently had charge
over one-third of the light beings whom the Almighty had created...
possibly numbering in the billions or trillions.

Now if you're a hard-core evolutionist you may not want to suffer through
the rest of this chapter, as physical evolution cannot account for spirit
entities, nor for the human soul for that matter. As for myself, I have a
"creationist-evolutionist" concept of reality, or that life in this
universe was 'created' by an Infinite Intelligence and then allowed to
'evolve' from there in various directions guided by the Creator. A better
term might be 'change' rather than to 'evolve', in that the term
'evolution' is equated with 'Darwinism' in many minds. Remember it has
ALWAYS been the THEORY of evolution, not the LAW of evolution. If one is
honest with themselves, they must accept the fact that evolution flies in
the face of the Second Law of Thermo-Dynamics. Now that is a LAW, not a
theory -- so which one are we to believe? In addition to this, a vast
number of protein molecules would have had to exist for even the simplest
life-form to appear. Just how these molecules could have come together by
chance and resulted in an organized life-form with complex DNA programming
and all is beyond me. According to the laws of probability the life-span of
an entire galaxy would not be enough time for just ONE protein molecule to
come together BY CHANCE out of the dark chaos of lifeless matter, if at
all. Then again there is the question of where the original matter came
from which supposedly resulted from the 'Big Bang' [THEORY], if ever there
was such an event.

Lucifer, as most may know from theological and eschatological traditions,
reflected the infinite 'light' of the Creator with great brilliance, and
therefore was given the name Lucifer, meaning "light bearer" -- 'bearer'
being the operative word here. Lucifer reflected the light of the Almighty
like a diamond reflects the light of the Sun. However, Lucifer began taking
his attention off of the SOURCE of all Life and began giving HIMSELF credit
for the 'light' that he bore [I use the term 'he' for semantic reasons
only, although this being -- as well as the Eternal Godhead -- was/is not
necessarily a being of physical gender from my own understanding], and the
next step was inevitable -- Lucifer became jealous of the position which
the Almighty One held.

Now I realize that many of you have different concepts of 'God', however
let us just indulge in a thought experiment for a moment. If one accepts
the concept of a 'Trinity', then one cannot accuse God of vainglory, for
the Father is ever seeking to glorify the Son [the Logos or the Living
Word] and the Spirit [which the Father and the only begotten 'Son' of God
share]. The same holds true with the Son and the Spirit, both of them
selflessly seeking to give 'glory' to their other two counterparts of the
Godhead. How can God be three distinct personalities yet one single 'God'?
[the pleural 'Eloheim' God AND the singular 'Jehovah' God at the same
time?]. One might just as well ask, how can the universe be 'one' universe
yet consist of space, time and matter... three distinct aspects, yet take
one of them away and the singular universe ceases to be? We can also use
the 'trinities' of ultraviolet-visible-infrared [LIGHT - and imitating the
Father, Son and Spirit, ultraviolet light is invisible, mid-spectrum light
is visible, and infrared light felt]; or length-width-height [SPACE];
past-present-future [TIME]; energy-motional-phenomena [MATTER],
proton-neutron-electron [ATOMS], and other 'triune' manifestations in
nature such as in humans themselves: the physical-material body, the
soular-mental body, and the astral-spiritual body and the sublevels of each
of these three distinctions... we ourselves being three-in-one beings.

If I'm beginning to sound preachy, then please bear with me. I believe that
many of you will agree that the Grey phenomena has BOTH a physical and
supernatural nature, and that we cannot fully understand one without
accepting the other. One could equate this to the division within the UFO
research community in the 1950's and 1960's over whether UFO's were nuts
and bolts craft or ethereal supernatural manifestations. Well... why not
BOTH?

So then, Lucifer, in his jealousy, rallies his followers [one-third of the
angelic beings] together and convinces them that God is being unjust, that
He's holding out on them and that he [Lucifer] has as much a right to be
Almighty God as does God Almighty Himself. In addition to this, Lucifer
tells his followers that they too can be Almighty Gods, all they have to do
is follow him in the rebellion.

Now, promising them godhood is very strange, since the more 'gods' there
are the more the term 'God' loses its singular distinction. It's like a
potential president promising every U.S. voter that if he is elected then
he will simultaneously make all of those who voted for him Presidents of
the United States! Do you see the insanity? Perhaps not, but it seems to be
obvious to me. You see, from my perspective if we are all gods then there
is NO God. Pantheism must ultimately lead to Atheism. If that's the way you
wish to believe then you certainly have the free agency to do so... But I'm
only trying to make a point that according to traditional Judeo-Christian
eschatological beliefs, this is the deception that Lucifer used to gain his
recruits -- the promise of 'godhood' or self-deification being the original
'venom' of the serpent [Genesis chapter 3]. And this is the deception that
the serpent-inspired Bavarian Illuminati cults via the Scottish Rite have
used to gain their recruits for a Luciferian World Order on earth, first by
infiltrating Masonry and then in turn by infiltrating the major religious
denominations of the world. Now you can accept this or leave it as you
will, I'm not trying to force any beliefs upon anyone, just attempting to
provoke some thought on the possible nature of the supernatural forces
motivating the Greys' collective. Since 'theological' manipulation is a
major part of the Greys' agenda, the eschatological component is one that
must be dealt with in order to understand the rest.

So the rebellion began, and the heavens were torn in two as the standing
and fallen angelics warred with each other, resulting in the fallen angels
being cast from the realm of Eternity and into the physical inter-galactic
universe. Could the 'subspace' beings described by Courtney Brown be fallen
light beings or rebel angels?

Brown stated that this 'leader' in ancient times had his followers
incarnate the reptilian Grey society, and had ordered them to sabotage
their race. The fourth planet of Zeta II Reticuli was the Greys' "home
world" at the time, however Zeta II Reticuli is a star lacking in
sufficient carbon content to allow for the 'natural' development of
carbon-based life [this is for those who may still cling to the
'evolutionist' philosophy], so the Greys must have colonized that world
sometime in the distant past.

The subspace beings, according to Brown, animated themselves through the
Greys and turned them toward a mindset of self-indulgence, which in turn
led to the drive within the Greys for immediate gratification at the
expense of their future and their world's resources [sound familiar?]. Once
their world had become a polluted, radioactive ruin which was threatening
their very genetic survival, the subspace beings under the command of their
'leader' offered a solution -- all the Greys had to do to survive was to
give up all individual rights and emotions, and submit to a collective-mind
which would control every aspect of the Greys' culture -- for their own
'good' of course, they were told. Using the excuse that individuality was
the root of the problem, the subspace collectivists took things to the
opposite extreme and insisted that assimilation into an absolute
collective-mind was the answer.

In other RV experiments, Brown 'saw' humanoids living on Mars in some past
era. A large planetoid grazed the atmosphere with such violence -- barely
missing the surface -- that storm of enormous magnitude swept across the
planet and much of the atmosphere itself was blown out into space. The
Greys [who were observing this event and could have prevented the disaster]
arrived as the planet was in the midst of upheaval, and offered to 'rescue'
the Martians, but at a price -- namely that the Martian humanoids surrender
their society to the control of the Greys' collective and that others be
cryogenically preserved in order to 'preserve' the humanoid Martian race.
Actually according to Brown the main purpose of the cryogenic project was
to 'preserve' them as sources for genetic materials to upgrade the Greys'
race from time to time. It was doubtful that they would ever be awakened,
at least en masse. This occurred mostly after the Martian humans had
escaped underground and were desperate for survival -- every day being a
struggle for existence.

NOW, according to Brown, Mars is under the control of the Greys, although
some pockets of humans and 'hybrids' may remain in various places
underground. Other sources claim that in 1985 the joint-operational
"Alternative 3" facilities on Mars were sabotaged and taken over by the
Draconians, or reptiloids and greys serving the Luciferian collective. This
was apparently one of several 'purges' that the aliens have carried out in
order to ensure the absolute conformity of the human collaborators to their
agenda, that is by purging out those renegades who possess too-much [from
their perspective] individuality, which is the mortal enemy of their
collective.

There is reportedly an elite force of 2000 'original' Greys based in the
Martian moon Phobos. These Greys are reportedly the 'hosts' for several
million 'clones' that have been bred to serve the reptilian elite in this
system. As suggested the Alternative-3 -- or the so-called pure-bred Aryan
"super race" -- humans on Mars and Luna may have been 'purged' due to some
level of resistance against the Draconian-Orion-Reticuli collectivist
forces with whom they 'collaborated'. Apparently these humans saw that the
two-sided 'collaboration' was turning into a one-sided 'dictatorship'
controlled by the reptilian elite, and this 'purge' within the Martian and
Lunar Alternative-3 facilities eliminated the resistance factions and
ensured that only the most die-hard and devoted mind-controlled 'Aryan'
slaves remained. In other words, these Aryan 'elite' suffered the very same
fate that they had planned for us 'lower races' on planet earth.

One source has stated that these events on Mars and Luna were one of the
main themes of discussion at the notorious meeting which took place between
George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and the Eastern spiritual leader Maitreya
[...whom the secret government has reportedly been teleporting around the
world using Montauk-type technology in an attempt to provoke a worshipful
response from those to whom he appears. Maitreya is the New World Order's
"ace in the hole" and may or may not even turn out to be "the one"
mentioned in Revelation chapter 13]. This meeting took place on the Island
of Malta in the late 1980's, and resulted largely out of Bush and
Gorbachev's terror over the events on Mars and the Moon, as well as similar
threats that were being faced by the "Alternative-2" underground colonies
maintained by the Military-Industrial Establishment in 'joint-capacity'
with the Greys. However let's get back to the subject at hand.

What Brown sensed was that the Greys were desperate. They realized that
they not only needed to genetically upgrade their race, but also needed to
attain emotional individuality in order for their culture to survive [and
this may have something to do with the 'hybrid' projects]. However they are
trapped by the collective itself... there is presently a great sense of
panic within the collective combined with a bizarre sense of protection
which the combined psychic continuity of the collective provides. Although
they are desperate to attain emotional individuality which they are
attempting to do by interfacing with humans, assimilating human genetics,
and producing quasi-hybrid genetic offspring, they cannot fully make the
break from the collective without the help of those who already exist in an
individualized state, namely the humans. For those of you who are familiar
with the scenario of the 'BORG' collective in the "STAR TREK: NEXT
GENERATION" series, certain episodes depicted a Borg entity by the name of
'Hue' who had developed emotional individuality during his captivity aboard
the Enterprise that resulted from his association with human individuals.
He was later sent back into the collective and introduced the idea of
individuality, and in later episodes gathered quite a following of other
'Borg' who had also broken-free from the collective and had developed
emotional individuality. The Reptilians are not alone in this dilemma,
since many, many human cultures are 'trapped' in collectivism as well, such
as those who are part of the Ashtar or Astarte collective.

The problem with the collectivist Greys is that -- although they need the
humans -- the self-destructive instructions coming down through the
collective itself from the Luciferian hierarchy are SABOTAGING all attempts
to deal with humans on a reasonable basis. Once they establish an agreement
with a humanoid culture for whatever motive, the collective commences to
use the agreement for its own imperialistic agendas, and the human
collaborators are betrayed and sometimes destroyed [as in the case of some
of the Alternative 2 and 3 bases], and war and/or conquest inevitably
results.

The only answer to the problem that I can see would be to concentrate on
severing individual reptiloids and greys from the collective and attacking
the "control centers" of the collective itself. In this case mere technical
and psychological attacks will not be enough... supernatural warfare will
be the only answer since we are dealing with 'subspace' beings. We need the
help of the standing angels, yet at the same time we need to be careful
since the fallen angels are good at masquerading as standing angels, which
they have often done with those humans who have 'channeled' these entities
via occult means -- the 'Heavens Gate' cult leaders and others like them
for instance -- feeding these 'mediums' with information which has later
turned out to be false, manipulative, or even deadly propaganda.

We must realize that the ONLY being in the collective which is allowed to
exercise individual choice is their dark leader, and to a lesser extent the
inner council, and these beings do NOT want the Reptiloids and Greys to
attain emotional individualism. But what about other 'collectives' like the
Ashtar or Astarte collective? Just who is this 'Ashtar'? Why is the Ashtar
collective so involved with the Dulce base activity in joint capacity with
the Greys and Reptiloids? Is it, as contactee Israel Norkin claims, because
the "Unholy Six" star systems of Orion have infiltrated the Ashtar
collective to a massive extent? What about the bald 9-foot tall Reptilian
"from the Pleiades" who supposedly defected from the Draconian collective,
HATONN? Why hasn't Hatonn been warning about this infiltration of his own
collective? Is it because he is secretly working FOR the Draconian-Orion
empire? Certainly if he was truly converted from the Draconian collective
he could be a lot more zealous in exposing it... especially its
infiltration of the Ashtar collective itself.

If we are to believe reports of "Star Wars" taking place within Sirius-B
where the Ashtar collective has one of its major headquarters, then this
leaves open the possibility that the Ashtar collective-alliance is in the
process of splitting or has split down the middle between an
interventionist Draco-Orionite faction and a non-interventionist
Andro-Pleiadean faction...



Now for some further theological speculation...



In II Peter 2:4 we read that:

"...God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."



This verse is apparently speaking of the high-level leaders of the ancient
rebellion, who were so malignant and evil that they were bound in dark
prisons deep under the earth. However the Bible gives several accounts of
fallen angels or demons that are fully ACTIVE on the SURFACE of the earth,
so we must conclude that these were lower ranking angels like the
'elementals' who were merely following the "party line", since they are
allowed more-or-less to roam about the earth freely. If such angels were
'condemned' when the first war in heaven ran its course, then WHY are they
still allowed to more or less roam free? Is God possibly giving them TIME
to reconsider their ways? Does the above verse mean that ALL fallen angels
are irreparably doomed? Or, has the Creator in his infinite mercy given
SOME of the fallen angels -- those who still maintain a semblance of regret
for their part in the rebellion -- one last chance by allowing them
physical incarnation through the Reptiloids and Greys? Could this be why
the Greys are so absolutely desperate to attain emotional individuality in
spite of the restraints of an individuality-killing collective? Could their
very eternal destinies be at stake?

A few years ago I would have totally rejected the possibility that some of
the fallen angels could be included in the plan of redemption, yet now I
wonder...

Now before you begin labeling me a heretic, I would like to quote three
versus regarding the serpent race [Greys, Reptiloids, etc.]:



"Now the serpent was more subtil [intelligent/cunning] than any beast of
the field... And the Lord God said unto the serpent... I will put enmity
between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed." -- Genesis
6:1,14-15



In its full context these verses imply that the fallen archangel Lucifer
was the being that had incarnated this particular reptilian -- possibly
something akin to a veliciraptor or stenonychosaurus equallus or a similar
type of bi-ped saurian hominoid -- and in turn the entire serpent race,
promising them power over man and nature if they would allow the
Luciferians to re-incarnate through their race at will. Whether you take
this passage literally or symbolically, the message is essentially the
same. Lucifer used the serpent race to deceive the humans into sabotaging
their own connection with the God-Source and thereby sabotaging their
supernatural dominion over the lower life forms -- and from that point
onward these lower life forms began turning wild and untamed because the
downward 'flow' of LIFE and ORDER had been broken at the human level, as
DEATH and CHAOS began to reign. One of the races which reverted to their
base animal or predatory instincts was of course the serpent race, which
originally held a position somewhere between mankind and the beasts. Due to
mankind's 'fall' and the reptilians' alliance with the Luciferians, the
serpent races began taking the upper-hand over the human race -- or rather,
the fallen angels began taking the upper hand over the human race THROUGH
the serpent races.

Today one could say that we see basically the same thing happening, however
in this case the "Luciferians" are known as "subspace beings", and the
"Serpents" through which they have incarnated are known as the "Grey
Aliens", who are attempting to enslave humankind by offering them/us
Trojan-horse gifts or "forbidden fruit" in the form of occult-technology to
those intent on using this technology to establish "god-like" control and
domination over their fellow man. As King Solomon once said, "there is no
new thing under the sun". But the point I want to make is that according to
the verse given above, fallen angels have been re-incarnating through the
Grey and Reptiloid [serpentine] races for several thousands of years.



And another verse:

"In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish
leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he
shall slay the dragon that is in the sea." -- Isaiah 27:1



This verse, unless I'm mistaken, is speaking of the reptilian COLLECTIVE
itself, which could be considered as a "piercing serpent".



And then the following verse, which literally threw me for a loop:



"Praise ye him, ALL his angels: praise ye him, ALL his hosts... Praise the
Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and ALL deeps." -- Psalm 148:2,7



Now unless I'm grossly misinterpreting scripture, it would seem that here
God is saying that the [fallen-angel-incarnated] serpent races are told to
praise the Almighty -- who after all was their creator before they allowed
their own race to be corrupted. This MAY apply to both the
spiritual-angelic and physical-bestial natures of the serpent races. Other
verses that we might add to the one above include:



"Let EVERY THING that hath BREATH praise the Lord." -- Psalm 150:6



"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
EVERY CREATURE." -- Mark 16:15



"And EVERY CREATURE which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I
saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." --
Revelation 5:13



In order to make the choice to appropriate the redemptive work of the
Christ, the Reptiloids and Greys would have to develop emotional
individuality and somehow become dis-connected from the "Luciferian
collective". They already possess the first requirement, being creatures
possessing the "breath of life". In order for a created being which has
fallen from grace to be redeemed, they must possess both a spiritual and
physical nature. Part of their nature has to 'die' in order for the other
part to live, just as the outward 'worm' of a caterpillar must die so that
the inward 'butterfly' can live. Although in this case the symbolism is
spiritual, it is essentially the same. An entirely spiritual being like a
fallen angel in this case could not be redeemed unless it possessed a
physical body -- as they would not possess a physical counterpart of
themselves that could 'die' so that the spiritual counterpart could live.
This would not necessarily be a physical death of the body, but a death of
the 'corrupted' or 'fallen' nature resident therein.

This fallen nature must first be acknowledged just as any other 'disease'
must be acknowledged in order to be cured. The 'death' of the fallen nature
is a death by proxy resulting from a faith-connection to the mysterious
working at Calvary, wherein the second member of the Godhead became 'flesh'
to serve as the final 'Passover Lamb' in order to recieve the full
retribution for all of the imperfect acts that all created beings with the
"breath of life" have committed before an absolutely perfect Creator. The
KEY would be however to consciously APPROPRIATE this 'Work' by directly
asking the Almighty for the chance to become a part of this mysterious
working at Calvary, which in essence serves as the 'heart-beat' from where
the universe is to be regenerated from its fallen state.

If all PHYSICAL life in the galaxy or universe originally had its origin on
planet earth, then earth would have been the appropriate place for the
Almighty to manifest Himself in physical form, to shed His life-blood so
that the creation might be redeemed by this very Divine and absolutely
pure/pristine life-essence which the Creator had loosed into His creation,
as a Divine "blood transfusion" if you will. This Divine flow was loosed
into the physical universe through the uncorrupted AND incorruptible
LIFE-blood of the last "Passover Lamb", which was shed and poured out into
the "cradle" of life, planet earth.

More and more cultures out among the stars are beginning to realize,
through ancient records that are being uncovered, that planet earth is
indeed the "cradle" from whence their distant ancestors emerged, the
original "cosmic gene pool", and that in a sense they are connected by an
invisible umbilicus to the "mother" world, and as they begin arriving here
en masse to visit the "genesis world" we Terrans or Eartheans must realize
that in a sense they are also a part of this world. The challenge will be
to learn how to respect each others INDIVIDUALITY, and how to claim the
FREEDOM and LIBERTY that is the inherent right of all human beings, so long
as it is practiced without violating the personal space and sovereignty of
our neighbors -- whether they come from realms below, above, upon or even
parallel with this world... this emerald world... this garden planet...
this 'divine tear' known as planet earth.

So long as an 'alien' force with ancient documented ties to planet earth
'claims territory' adjacent to this planet which has NOT YET been claimed,
such as undeveloped underground areas, there should be NO problem from
those living on the surface. In the same way surface dwellers should
respect subterranean cultures TO THE EXTENT THAT those cultures respect
them. Being an individualist, I am a firm believer that every nation on/in
earth deserves to maintain its individuality and cultural distinction SO
LONG AS they do not violate the sovereignty of their neighbors. Each
country should have the right to determine its own economic, political and
spiritual destinies SO LONG AS they do not violate the same of other
countries.

It goes without saying that I am totally against a one world collectivist
government which cannot tolerate individuality or independence in any form.
However the loss of national sovereignties are often the result of human
greed, for instance international bankers loaning billions to smaller
countries fully knowing that the selfish leaders of those countries will
squander the wealth and fail to re-pay the loans, thus opening the way for
the 'banksters' to claim that countries' national reserves, mineral rights,
properties, and other national resources along with a loss of sovereignty.
I would hope that the respect for sovereignty on a national basis would
cascade down to the individual level also.

In addition to the above, unless their existence is being threatened by
radioactive dangers or some other threat, a sub-surface culture should not
interfere with the activities of surface cultures: they should not steal
resources, release radioactive poisons into surface environments, or
biological diseases, or mutilate animals, or abduct people against their
will, or use focused electronic beams to invade the privacy of those on the
surface, or interfere with the minds of surface dwellers in any way, or
engage in ANY FORM OF INVASION OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY OR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF ANY
OTHER NON-SURFACE COMMUNITY.

Many alien forces, especially the draconian-interventionist-collectivists
who DO NOT respect individual sovereignty, have VIOLATED this universal law
and as a result their territories MUST inevitably be INVADED by those
cultures whom they are abusing or violating in order to preserve their
national security. And it also goes without saying that the 'Dulce empire'
has EARNED the WRATH of Americans due to the UNSPEAKABLE atrocities being
carried out there against OUR OWN PEOPLE. I absolutely recommend that a
full-scale Congressionally-backed invasion and take-over of the Dulce base
and its peripheral facilities would be FULLY JUSTIFIED, and the SOONER THE
BETTER! After all, DIDN'T WE AS AMERICAN CITIZENS PAY FOR THE 'UNDERGROUND
EMPIRE' WITH OUR OWN TAX DOLLARS?

Once all resistance within the Dulce facility is SMASHED and its captives
are LIBERATED, and after all activities there are brought under FULL
Congressional oversight, those agents operating within this facility should
be tried and prosecuted by due process of law, be they human or alien, and
if not executed or imprisoned they should be banished from the planet until
they can PROVE that they are able to respect human individuality and
freedom. We ourselves must learn the same lesson, since it was in most
cases men who violated our trust and Constitutional sovereignty as U.S.
citizens -- and in fact as world citizens -- who have 'betrayed' us to
these alien parasites by opening up the door for them to come in, in many
cases in order to facilitate their own desires to DOMINATE their fellow
human beings.

When the Dulce base is conquered and subdued, we should commence to
liberate other oppressed areas within the underground network. Let us
remember however that, aside from assisting in their 'liberation', we as
Americans or world citizens should not [in our retaliatory actions against
invasive subterranean centers] violate the territories or sovereignty of
other interior dwellers who have NOT participated in the draconian-backed
abductions and attacks against the citizens of America and of the World.
