Fall 1994- ARCO, Eastlund and the Roots of HAARP

By Gar Smith

All atomic and electronic technologies -- from household appliances to
nuclear weapons -- radiate energetic particles. While the immediate impacts
of human-caused electromagnetic pollution are generally imperceptible, the
long-term consequences for the biosphere can be profound.

In 1988, OMNI magazine raised concerns about the environmental consequences
of a bizarre electromagnetic invention. According to OMNI, ARCO, the US oil
giant, found itself wondering what to do with the estimated 30 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas that it hoped to extract from Alaska's North
Slope. While this was enough energy to supply the US for a year, the gas
fields were too far from any potential customers. ARCO concluded that it
would be too expensive to liquefy the gas and ship it thousands of miles to
urban centers. What was needed was a client that wanted access to vast
amounts of energy on-site -- in the wilds of Alaska.

Bernard Eastland, an MIT and Columbia University physicist with eight years
experience with the Atomic Energy Commission, came to the rescue with an
extraordinary plan to use the energy "at the point of production."

Eastland, who soon became president of ARCO's Production Techno- logies
International Company in Houston, proposed burning the vast Alaskan gas
fields to power a huge electric generator. The resulting power would be
directed into a huge antenna complex, 40 miles on a side. The antennae
would be used to focus an intense beam of electro- magnetic energy into the
upper atmosphere where it would collide with the ionosphere to create a
phenomenon called the "mirror force." Eastland was granted a US Patent (#
4,686,605) for this invention on August 11, 1987.

"You can virtually lift part of the upper atmosphere," Eastland told OMNI,
"You can make it move, do things to it." One of the tricks Eastland
envisioned involved "surgically" distorting the ionosphere to disrupt
global communications. Pushing the upper atmosphere around might also
generate high-altitude "drag" that could heat and deflect enemy missiles or
surround them with "high-energy electrons" that might cause the missiles to
detonate in mid-trajectory.

The proposal appealed to the Pentagon, which invested several hundred
thousand dollars "evaluating" Eastland's work. Eastland maintained that
there were "peaceful" uses for his technology. In one scenario, he
explained how beams of electromagnetic power could lift portions of the
upper atmosphere and redirect the jetstream to alter global weather
patterns. Using "plumes of atmospheric particles to act as a lens or
focusing device," Eastland proposed redirecting sunlight and heat to
different parts of the Earth's surface, making it possible to manipulate
wind patterns, cause rainstorms in Ethiopia, drive hurricanes out of the
Caribbean, incinerate airborne industrial pollution and sew up the hole in
the Antarctic ozone layer.

"Because the upper atmosphere is extremely sensitive to small changes in
its composition," OMNI cautioned, "merely TESTING an East- land Device
could cause irreversible damage."

* * * * * * * [More on HAARP and the Atlantic Richfield Co. -- ARCO --
Connection. - Wol.] TITLE: DOOMSDAY DEATH RAY SUBTITLE Is the U.S.
Government Testing a Secret Mega-Weapon? AUTHOR: Agent X PUBLICATION: The
Nose Magazine DATE: Issue #26 (March 1995) RADIO WAVES AREN'T JUST for
beaming Kenny G to the masses or nuking frozen burritos anymore. If the
Pentagon's Strangelovian big-brains have their way, the earth's ionosphere
-- maybe our entire planet -- will never be the same. Tucked away in the
backwoods of Alaska, 11 miles outside the comatose hamlet of Gakona (200
miles east of Anchorage), the U.S. Air Force/Navy High Frequency Active
Auroral Research Project (HAARP) plans to "heat" the ionosphere, the
uppermost layer of the atmosphere that ranges 35 to 500 miles above the
surface of the earth. The ionosphere consists mainly of charged particles
-- ions and free electrons. HAARP will excite these particles by injecting
more than a gigawatt (one billion watts) of electromagnetic radiation into
earth's atmosphere, in the form of high-frequency radio waves. The goal of
this rarely mentioned project is to produce a system capable of weather
control, surveillance and wholesale destruction. Our government steadfastly
denies it. In marked contrast to other advanced weapons-related programs,
HAARP is not part of the officially denied "Blackworld" budget. Rather, the
military insists that HAARP is a strictly scientific program to study the
aurora borealis (or Northern Lights), when in fact it is a device intended
to seriously tweak the ionosphere for purposes that are less than benign.
In high-latitude Alaska, the site of the installation, the Earth's magnetic
force field is easier to access and manipulate. There are very few citizens
to get in the way or ask bothersome questions. When asked about the project
and whether the military had briefed them, a spokesman for Alaska governor
Tony Knowles responded, "We have no idea in hell what you're talking
about." Rising ominously above the black spruce forest, looking like a set
from a Star Wars movie, HAARP is located at a defunct over the- horizon
radar installation, itself a relic of the Cold War. The facility consists
of an enormous power generator and transmitter building and multiple
72-foot emitters spread over several acres, surrounded by barbed wire and
nasty security signs. The signal is aimed -- you guessed it -- straight up.
BUILT by ARCO Power Technologies, HAARP is due to begin initial testing as
this story goes to press. During 1996, a planned $75 million increase to
the already multi megabuck project will increase the output of the system
to over 1.7 gigawatts, making HAARP the most powerful emitter in the world.
Several smaller sites exist around the world, most notably in Russia.
Though these installations cannot match the ionosphere heating capabilities
of HAARP, some experts in the field who wish not to be quoted suggest that
some aberrant weather conditions MAY HAVE been caused by their operation.
The weapon-development whiz kids have been interested in this sort of gizmo
for quite some time. Just what in hell does the military want with the
world's largest weenie roaster? Here are some possible applications I've
discovered: EARTH-PENETRATING TOMOGRAPHY Sort of a CAT scan for the planet.
By heating the ionosphere to create a resonant mirror, electronic-beam
steering directs an energy stream to specific coordinates on the planet.
This energy penetrates the ground to a depth of a kilometer or more, and
the signal return is received by satellite or aircraft. After computer
processing, A RELATIVELY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT IS UNDERGROUND emerges. Damn
handy when trying to figure out where those wily North Koreans hide their
nukes -- or where YOU keep your stash. HARD-KILL WEAPON SYSTEM The output
of HAARP would have to be boosted a thousand-fold, but if that is
accomplished, a shell of high-speed electrons can be constructed that
encompasses the earth. Any ballistic missile or warhead passing through the
shell would explode. SOFT-KILL WEAPON SYSTEM By directing enormous amounts
of radio-frequency energy at a specific area, HAARP could overload
electrical power distribution grids, fry sensitive microelectronics,
detonate weapons that use electronic fuses, scramble missile guidance
systems and probably upset brain chemistry. WEATHER MODIFICATION Heating
the upper atmosphere over specific areas could change weather patterns,
creating torrential floods, destroying an enemy's infrastructure or denying
an enemy's harvest by drought... Weather as a weapon. IDENTIFICATION OF
SATELLITES By illuminating orbiting spacecraft with HAARP, the constituent
materials and the mission of a satellite can be assessed. COMMUNICATIONS
Possible uses include satellite jamming, satellite communications with
submarines and detection of stealth aircraft. Physicist Bernard Eastlund,
president of Production Technologies Company and former ARCO bigwig, was
granted three patents over the past seven years for a system that looks
suspiciously like HAARP_- though much larger. His plan, using a transmitter
encompassing 160 square miles and powered by massive amounts of electricity
generated using vast Alaskan natural gas reserves (to which ARCO has
access), was to shoot down missiles and alter the weather. ARCO initially
owned Eastlund's patents, but was soon paid a visit by Edward Teller (the
"father of the H-Bomb", MJ-12 member and Nevada Test Site coordinator for
the "Star Wars" or SDI defense program. - Wol.), and development grew
secretive. Eastlund declined further involvement, and the patents were
quietly sold in June 1994 to E-Systems, a high-tech corporation famous for
ultra-secret defense projects such as the president's custom- ized Boeing
747 doomsday plane. "HAARP is the perfect first step towards a plan like
mine," Eastlund says. "Advances in phased-array transmitter technology and
power generation can produce the field strength required. The government
will say it isn't so, but if it quacks like a duck and it looks like a
duck, there's a good chance it is duck." "Eastlund is nuts," says an Air
Force official speaking on condition of anonymity. "HAARP is much smaller
and less powerful than his instrument. We are not doing anything except
good science and pure research. "The real beauty of HAARP," he then adds
cryptically, "is that nothing you can see on the outside is sensitive. The
secret is the beam steering agility and pulsing of the transmissions...
When covert operations occur, the science team, the operating funds and the
mission will be black." Whatever is going on, Alaskans are mad as hell. The
federal government enjoys a long tradition of screwing over the inhabitants
of the Last Frontier. Generally speaking, the feds are as welcome as a case
of herpes. And studies done by the EPA, the Swedish government and others
indicate that HAARP could interfere with communications, navigation
systems, wildlife migration and possibly human health. "There has never
been a transmitter of this power in this frequency," Eastlund says. "It
would be wise to assess its impact." Though there are many questions, the
military insists that all is well and there is nothing to worry about. "We
are not doing anything to the ionosphere -- we are just looking at it,"
insists Air Force Phillips Laboratory spokesman Roy Heitman. Although an
ad-hoc grassroots organization called NO HAARP is trying to stop the
project, founder Clare Zickuhr admits, "It's all a whitewash, [HAARP] is
going to happen." An ARCO retiree, Zickuhr is convinced HAARP is a secret
weapons project. "It has all the appearances of a secret program. This is
not good science -- they have no idea what this thing could do to the
ionosphere. To put this in the hands of the military scares the hell out of
me." Me too. (Remember however that, although this particular ex-ARCO
employee -- Zickuhr -- is against the project, the HAARP facility in Alaska
was never-the-less CONSTRUCTED by ARCO POWER TECHNOLOGIES. - Wol.) ### * *
