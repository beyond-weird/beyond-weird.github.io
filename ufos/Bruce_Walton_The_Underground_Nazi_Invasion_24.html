Preliminary remark: When I wrote the first version of this

report, called "Mind Control - Memories of a Victim", I thought

that I had remembered and understood the essential elements 
of
f the mind control treatment I am suffering from. But meanwhile 

new insights made the revision of this paper necessary. So I 

would like to apologize to the readers of the earlier version 

of 
these memories that they now have to read the text again, if 

they are still interested in my case.

What is Mind Control?



Mind control is the misuse of the most advanced knowledge 
and

 techniques of the behavioral sciences, of psychiatry and

psychology, combined with the very old methods of torture 
and

 brainwashing, for the purposes of the military industrial

complex. The general objective of mind control is to transform 
a

 human being into an organism which is as intelligent and

competent as a human being -- but which has no free will, 
which

 could be programmed like a computer, which is not able 
to ponder

 upon the consequences of programmed actions and 
which is not

 capable to remember the process of programming 
and even the

 programmed actions after they were finished. Mind 
control is

 industrial production with people as raw material. In 
most cases

 it is arms production, but you can use mind control-
led people for other purposes, too. 



To seal up the source of radiation after an accident in a nuclear

power station, for example, could be a suicide squad. Skilled

mind controlled technicians were able to overcome these

difficulties -- calm, without signs of fear... ignorant of the

 deadly 
danger they are in. Secret services or the political

 police can 
benefit from mind control, too. To infiltrate certain

 terrorist groups 
could be so dangerous that nobody with free will

 would accept 
to do this, but a mind controlled zombie would have

 no choice. 
Young, good-looking women (and sometimes men) could be

abused as mind controlled sex slaves to satisfy the perverted

 
desires of powerful politicians -- being mere tools doomed to

 
forget the degrading experiences afterwards. And of course the

 
armed forces are interested in fearless, machine-like soldiers

 
impeccably fighting in situations with no hope to save their own

 lives.



Examples like this make clear that with mind control the

'democratic' (or fascio-cratic? - Wol.) state under the law can 
solve some of the intricate

 political problems concerning free 
will in complex hierarchical

 societies definitely. Of course this 
sentence sounds cynical -

- but you can't survive mind control 
without a good sense of black humor. Although mind control is 
administered secretly, some

 representatives of the 'democratic' 
state have to be informed...

 and so a convincing justification was 
CREATED and fostered by the

 Satanic Cult of National Security 
(SCNS). The essence of this

 justification is that in order to save 
democracy you have to

 ABANDON it gradually. It is not surprising 
that in many aspects

 the Satanic Cult of National Security (SCNS) 
resembles a FASCIST secret society... The 'democratic fascists'

CLAIM that behaving like fascists is forced on them by the enemies 
of the free world (communists, Moslems or other aliens) -

- they 
are reactive fascists. In contrast to the German Nazis

 (National-
sozialisten) they aren't guided by an elaborated

 ideology; their 
cognitive frame of reference is pure technology.

 They are techno-
fascists. This doesn't mean that they don't use

 ideologies, but 
they are not identified with a special ideology

 as the German 
Nazis with racism and nationalism.  (I would argue with this point,
in that the writer may NOT be aware of the direct links between 
the Nazi S.S. and the CIA-NSA "National Security" agencies. -
Wol.) Techno-fascism

 employs properly adjusted ideologies as 
refined tools in the

 process of mass communication and public 
relations. It is a

 defining feature of techno-fascism that the fascist 
interventions

 are hidden behind a democratic FACADE. Mind 
control is the modus

 operandi and vivendi of an innovative kind 
of fascism which is

 facade-democratic, so-called reactive, techno-
pragmatic and based

 on the advances of the behavioral sciences, 
especially

 psychology, psychiatry and the neuro-sciences. The 
ultimate goal

 of the SCNS is to subjugate the people to dictatorial 
control, to

 prevent them from recognizing this and to replace the 
real experience of slavery with the fictitious experience of being a

citizen of a democratic state under the law.  (Living under slavery
while being 'programmed' to believe that one is 'free', or at least
as free as they are capable of being. - Wol.) One of the methods

to achieve this goal is mind control, the most frequently used

technique is television.



The Basic Process



The process of producing a mind controlled individual usually

runs through three phases:



Phase 1: The goal of this phase is to prepare the mind and the

nervous system of the victim for programming. And so the victim

is placed into the condition of extreme helplessness,

 disorientation 
and fear, is confronted with massive physical and

 mental stressors. 
The victim's sense of self-preservation is

 undermined, his identity 
is weakened or destroyed, he is

 regressed to the emotional and 
cognitive state of an infant and his mind is dissociated.



Phase 2: The goal of this phase is to program the victim like a

robot or computer with new attitudes, plans of behavior and new

frames of reference, in which the attitudes and plans make sense.

At least TWO PERSONALITIES are constructed: A robot person-
ality

 that is consciously in contact with the controllers to receive

the programming; An artificial new personality that is

 unconscious 
of the fact of being programmed and that is

 unconsciously deter-
mined by the robot personality. The robot

 defines himself as a robot; 
the conscious artificial personality

 defines itself as a man. The robot 
is programmed with endlessly

 repeated indoctrinations and by means 
of conditioning

 (punishments and rewards). The robot is called a 
"slave". The

 slave is the interface between the controllers and the 
new artificial personality OR personalities.



Phase 3: The goal of phase 3 is to selectively erase the memory

of the victim. This is not really a erasure of memory in the

 sense 
that the contents of memory are destroyed. Instead the

 faculty to 
remember certain experiences is deleted. At least two

 domains are 
erased: All episodes directly or indirectly associated with the process 
of mind control, all biographical
 elements that doesn't fit for the logic 
of the new artificial

 personality.



(Note: I have experienced personally what appears to be a 'double
existance' consisting of a 'conscious' life and an 'unconscious' or
programmed personality.  In 1995 I had 'suspected' such, however
the details or evidence of my suspicions seemed to evade me.
That is until I began 'hearing voices' in my mind -- from some lost
or stolen memory? -- insisting that I was a "CIA agent".  I thought
I might have been going genuinely insane until I was told something
very interesting by a friend of mine who has apparently been a
victim of mind control since she was a young girl.  Her father worked
with the Manhattan and other top secret projects, so it would seem
that if anyone would become involved in such a scenario, she would.
Anyway, she told me that on at least two occasions yours truly had 
come by her place and had taken her to what apparently turned out 
to be an underground government [or NWO?] facility.  The memories
of these excursions were at first deleted from her mind and of course
I myself had no recollection of the events, save for some bizarre
'dreams' which I had passed off as merely the creation of my sub-
conscious mind.  On one of these occasions she claimed that I
told her that I worked for the "CIA".  She also stated that my actions
during these trips were robotic and that I was left-handed when in
my conscious life I am right-handed.  This really threw me for a loop
because I was aware of the fact that humans do not posses merely
one 'brain' but two brains in one -- the left and right hemispheres.
From what I had learned earlier, I knew that those who suffer from
alternate personalities are usually "consciously" active in one 
hemesphere whereas the "alternate" personality operates from the
other.  In my case I am consciously left-brained and therefore right
handed.  If I am left-handed in the "altered state" in which my friend
claimed she encountered me, then the "programmed" personality
would be right-brain dominant.  It would not be so much "erasing"
the memory each time as it would be "switching" from one brain-
lobe to another.  This may sound fantastic, that neuro-science 
might have developed to such Orwellian proportions, however I have 
no other explanation for the otherwise unexplained mental hell and
torment that I have suffered throughout my life [especially since I
began probing into this whole damned Nazi conspiracy] or for the 
unusual memories of my friend.  She stated that it was the residual 
EMOTIONS involved in the events which eventually brought back 
the MEMORIES.  Apparently these NAZI-CIA controllers can mani-
pulate the electro-chemical processes of the human mind, but the 
emotional state is somewhat more evasive and difficult to apprehend 
or control.  This is apparently one of the weaknesses of their plan.  
Thoughts are easily suppressed, emotions are a different story. 
- Wol.)

The overall goal of this process is to convince the victim that

 she 
or he is absolutely powerless and the mind controllers are

 almighty 
like god.



The Role of Torture



I am surprised that many authors writing about mind control

 believe 
that human robots (zombies, slaves) can be produced by

 means of 
hypnotism, drugs and electrical stimulation of the brain

 (ESB) alone 
-- eventually completed by some "mild" or symbolic

 forms of torture 
like psychic driving or sensory deprivation.

 (Walter H. Bowart has
corrected this error in the 2nd edition of

 his pioneering and breathtaking 
book "Operation Mind Control,

 Second Edition".) 



But drugs, ESB and especially hypnotism are not so powerful.

 There 
may be some wizards who can manage a lot with hypnotism.

 Never-
theless mind control is not vaudeville, but industrial

 production. I 
am convinced that only unrestricted physical

 torture in combination 
with the "soft" psychological and

 psycho-physiological methods can 
do the job. Today to torture

 somebody you don't need a rack from
the Middle Ages; this could

 be replaced nowadays with a device 
emitting the appropriate

 electromagnetic waveforms and frequencies. 
So with the term

 "physical torture" I mean torture of the NERVOUS
SYSTEM, too.



The functions of unrestricted physical torture are at least: to

 asso-
ciate the original personality of the victim with pain, panic

 and horror 
-- the desired personality is conditioned with pleasure

 afterwards; 
to function as aversion conditioning to establish new behavior 
patterns; to establish a panic-controlled mechanism of

 amnesia 
("If you remember, you will try to betray us, but we will

 be informed 
before you succeed in managing this, because we are

 everywhere, 
then you will be tortured again, so you will not

 remember!"); to produce 
an artificial, controlled Multiple Personality Disorder (which is under 
natural conditions a result

 of traumatization -- ill-treatment, sexual 
abuse in childhood --,

 too).



And by the way torture itself, even if not combined with mind

 control 
techniques, elicits amnestic disorders or memory blockades

 con-
cerning the process of torture in many cases. With heavy

 electro-
shocks the victim is regressed to a state of an infant.

 Then the torture 
resembles psychologically the ill-treatment in

 childhood. Rape is 
common, too, as an equivalent of sexual abuse

 in infancy. Being a 
human robot means to be mentally ill, means

 to be a person suffering 
from Multiple Personality Disorder

 (MPD). The difference between a 
"natural" MPD and a artificial,

 mind controlled MPD is, that the latter 
was consciously tailored

 by the controllers to whom the victim is tied 
by invisible

 unconscious chains. Many students in the field of psycho-
logy and

 psychiatry don't believe that mind control is possible... and

that is probably because they haven't understood the basic

 concept: 
MPD produced by a simulation of the natural conditions

 of its causes. 
This is very important: Only if the natural

 conditions of the causes 
of MPD are reproduced, a human robot

 will work reliably. And that 
is a "must" in all clandestine

 actions.



The Methods



As far as I can remember I was the victim of a program with the

aim to delete my personality -- literally to dissolute my

 personality 
and extract it from my nervous system. I am not sure

 whether I am 
able to put all the details I remember in the right

 chronological order. 
During a mind control treatment you lose your ability to localize your-
self in space and time as a

 consequence of being electroshocked, 
drugged, hypnotized and

 treated with electromagnetic fields. They 
told me that I was

 sentenced to death for spying and that they have 
found a method to execute me, but leave my body alive.



To achieve this aim they applied a least the following methods:



Depatterning treatment using electroshocks, prolonged sleep and

psychic driving (D.E.Cameron).



A method developed by H.C. Tien called ELT (Electrolytic
 Treatment). 
This uses electroshock and behavior modification with

 an aversion 
conditioning of the old and a reward conditioning of

 the desired 
personality. This is the most perverted method which

 ever has been 
developed in the frame of classical psychiatry.



Classical hypnosis, drugs and so on.



Electrical torture of my penis. They used a device which I call 
a

 "torture trouser". This is a sort of loin-cloth made of leather

and steel bonds by which an electrode is fastened to the penis 
of

 the victim. They probably insert an electrode in the urethra. So

they can induce maximal pain with minimal traces. Not leaving

visible marks of torture is essential, because these signs could

remind the victim of being brainwashed in spite of the fact that

his memory has been erased electronically afterwards. For

 electric 
supply they use a cable or a battery so that you can

 freely move 
and if the torturer wants to torture you he sends an

 electric signal 
to the battery using a transmitter. This is a

 very practical device 
for aversion "therapy". 



They suggested to me that they would torture me so long until I

gave up my life, until I accept to be dead, until I would be dead

with my body alive. And indeed, after some time the victim is

forced in[to] some sort of "feign death reflex" concerning his

original personality. This feign death reflex is frozen

 afterwards 
by dissolution of memory. They gave me a drug that

 induces near 
death experiences. When I was clinically dead a

 voice suggested 
to me that he was god and that he had decided

 that I have to be 
born again as a slave. Then I was reanimated.



They used electromagnetic fields to induce panic, fear,

 depression 
and pleasure. By this means they conditioned me very

 effectively. 
They used ESB, too, but it was not so effective.

 They even coagu-
lated parts of my nucleus amygdala to produce

 obedience. They 
detected the brain wave patterns associated with

 mental states 
and conditioned not only the mental states, but the

 associated 
neurophysiological states, too.



They obviously have found a wavelength with hypnotic effects so

that they could give me posthypnotic orders in deep trance

 states.



My memory was erased by electroshocks, radiation, drugs,

 post-
hypnotic orders and the described torture mechanism.



The Triangulation of the Mind



To triangulate the mind of the victim the following steps are

necessary:



The basic or original personality of the victim is compelled to a

"feign death reflex" by means of torture and frozen in this

 condition. 
The "feign death reflex" is associated with a modus of

 absent 
consciousness hard to describe, which is not synonymous

 with 
unconsciousness. It is the consciousness of a living dead

 person 
-- a human being who has been subjected to the fiction of

 being 
dead, who is actively producing this fiction. Living

 literally as if being 
dead is the irrationality of a victim who

 went through a hell nobody 
can imagine who hasn't experienced it.

 Generally the logic of the 
"as if" is one of the most important

 keys to understand the mech-
anisms of mind control.



An artificial robot personality is created that receives programs

consciously. This robot personality is subjected to the fiction

of being unable to have self-consciousness. It is programmed 
with a set of rules, (self-)definitions, attitudes, and views of life.

According to this heuristic behavior, tuning the robot will steer

the desired new personality out of the subconscious. But this is

a very special kind of subconscious. The robot is working as if 
it

 were subconscious, but it is fully aware of reality and of the

ongoing actions performed by the new personality. It is not able

to develop even a rudimentary form of self-consciousness. It is

executing its meta-program to program the new personality well

adapted to the inner preconditions and the outer circumstances.



The new personality "doesn't know" that it has been mind

 controlled, 
can't remember the treatment and is not aware of the

 robot unit in 
the background of its consciousness. The robot unit

 resides in the 
blind spot of the self-consciousness of the new personality. (In my
own experience the "automic" artificial personality or programming 
is supplemented by sophisticated electronic implants along the line 
of the "stimociever".  Several of these implants have been discov-
ered through X-Ray and MRI scans of people who have experienced 
"missing time" episodes during which they have no recollection of 
where they were.  Fewer of these have had the implants removed, 
and these have been studied under electron microscopes and found 
to contain sophisticated micro-electronic circuits.  Removal of the 
implants is a very dangerous procedure in that they are usually 
imbedded within or attached to the nervous system, which then 
commences to "grow around" the implant, making removal without 
inflicting nerve damage very difficult. - Wol.)  This is a very exhausting 
kind of double existence.

 It absorbs so much of [ones] emotional 
energy that it is in many cases
 relatively easy for the mind controllers 
to plant a suicide program.

(Note: Tie this in with the reports of "UFO abductees" who have 
reported "missing time" and reception of "alien implants".  Could this 
at least in part be the result of a massive operation carried out by the 
"Fourth Reich of Antarctica" to program human mind-slaves throughout
the world en masse using advanced antigravity and mind control tech-
nology, with possible collaboration with the CIA -- with the ultimate
goal of establishing a global fascist dictatorship via the secret societies 
of Bavaria, and their subsidiary branches which the Antarcticans appar-
ently and ultimately control? - Wol.)



To ensure that the robot unit is working reliably it is

 programmed with 
the following suggestions:



"You are our robot. If you are conscious you will be here with

us. If you are here with us you will be tortured. Your job is to

steer the new personalty which will replace the bad old

 person-
ality you once was and which is dead now. Your job is to

 keep 
this bad old personality dead. You have to steer the new

 per-
sonality according to our guidelines... from the subconscious.

Whenever you are conscious you will be here and then you will 
be

 tortured again. If you perform your task well you won't be

tortured so often and cruel. But even if you are a good robot we

will catch you from time to time to refresh your programming.

Then of course you will be tortured, too. 



"That's why you will have to get used to the torture. Being

tortured is your world. Even if you are working perfectly you

will be tortured from time to time -- until the end of your life.

Sometime we will kill you. But don't mind. You will not know 
when

 this will happen. The better you are functioning, the better 
you

 will be treated. That's your fate. You can't escape this hell. 
So it would be the best to learn to enjoy the torture. Pain is

pleasure, pleasure is pain. We have implanted a transmitter 
into

 your brain. We can detect whether you are conscious or 
not. You

 are kept under surveillance using satellites. Whenever 
you stop

 working reliably and whenever you become conscious, 
this will be

 detected and then you will be tortured with extreme 
cruelty. We

 are everywhere." 

It doesn't matter whether the mentioned

 surveillance technology 
really exists. What counts is that the

 robot BELIEVES in it.



Following theses three steps the psychodynamics of mind 
control is

 generated. This is the heart of human robotics. The 
survival

 instinct is associated with the new, artificial personality.

Sometimes mind control is employed without generating such a

sophisticated triangular structure. Then the victim is working on

the basis of algorithmic programs only -- for example:

 assassin-
ating a foreign politician and then committing suicide.

 This more 
behavioristic kind of programming is suitable for

 well-defined 
short-term tasks, but isn't flexible enough to

 exhaust the full 
potential of human robotics. For fine-tuning the

 robot behavior, 
the most advanced knowledge of cognitive

 psychology is 
exploited.



Who They Were?



Every detective starts his investigation with Cicero's old

 question: 
"Qui bono?" They "SAID" they were the Mossad (Israel's

 CIA) 
and the Shaback (Israel's FBI). As a GERMAN I would like to

make clear that I am not an anti-semitic or an enemy of the state

of Israel. Perhaps the controllers FALSELY told me [they were] 
Israelis

 because they knew that a German insisting to be tortured 
by Israelis will be suspected of being an anti-semitic liar. I was

kidnapped and brought to a interrogation camp in a desert for

several times. But I can't be sure that they really were the

 Mossad, 
the Shaback or the CIA. Some say I were a victim of an

 INTER-
NATIONAL secret service and psychiatry cooperation headed by

the Pentagon in the name of "national security". But I have no

proof, only memories. Because I don't know who they were I will

call them ironically SCNS in the following lines. This

 abbreviation 
stands for "Satanic Cult of National Security". The

 controllers told 
me that the Soviets had developed powerful mind

 control techniques 
so that they were urged to do the same. This is an old TRICK used 
again and again in history. I clearly object

 to the suspicion that 
the organization behind this assault on

 human rights comes from 
outer space or has something to do with

 "real" satanic cults (other 
than the SCNS), the Illuminati or

 another kind of conspiracy... but 
if aliens exist they are probably not so

 cruel as our human all-to-
human controllers. Sometimes the controllers lead their victims 
to believe they were aliens,

 "real", non-governmental satanists or 
something like that. But

 these are obviously cover stories. The 
SCNS is phenomenologically

 a cult, but essentially a governmental 
structure. We must stop

 them. What they are trying is mental 
holocaust, nothing [less].

 What I have experienced was some sort 
of instant concentration

 camp. It is my strong belief that the basic 
ideas of mind

 control and human robot production stem from Ger-
man KZs. KZ is the German abbreviation for "concentration camp"

(Konzentrationslager). I don't know who the Werner-von-Braun of

KZ-Psychiatry was who was hired by the US intelligence agencies

after the war, but the modus operandi of mind control makes me

believe that initially a potent NAZI brain was hidden behind it.


(Note: this writer apparently is not of the "Nazi" philosophy, how-
ever he is admittedly German.  Nazism was not or is not "entirely"
a German phenomena, as many German scientists did flee to
America from Germany as the Nazi's were manipulating their way 
into power.  Germany has played some beneficial role in history,
especially in regards to the Lutheran Reformation and the Gutten-
burg printing presses that helped to spark the age of Enlighten-
ment which pulled the world out of the sewers of the Dark Ages.
Unfortunately Luther and Guttenberg failed to give up the ancient 
cultural anti-Semitism which was rooted within the Germanic 
culture, and the Nazi's played this for all it was worth.  This cult-
ural anti-Semitism reaches at least as far back as the ancient 
alliance between the German military and the Roman government 
when both controlled Europe at the height of the Roman Empire
and later the so-called -- and I would say blasphemously named
-- "Holy Roman Empire", in spite of internal in-fighting and often 
violent disagreements.  The age of the Roman Empire was a time 
when both the Bavarians and the Romans had committed horren-
dous atrocities against the Jews, not the least of which was the 
destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the seige on Massada, and 
so on... - Wol.)


Freedom of Thought



It took me years to convince myself that I was a victim of mind

control and I hope that I am able to make people believing my

story a little bit faster. Being asked why I go through all these

horrors of mind control again by writing about it I can only say

that I have decided to fight against these methods because the

most precious value mankind possesses is at stake: the freedom 
of

 thought. Freedom of thought is the root of curiosity which is

the fertile soil of creativity, joy of discovery, progress and

 even 
love. Although I have heard about mind control projects

 concern-
ing the whole society, I would rather argue that at the

 moment 
only a small number of people are affected. But nonetheless

 even 
mind control projects on a minor scale are dangerous enough.

I hope that the responsible politicians who have been lulled by

mind control scientist with the seductive melody of fate control

of people will sooner or later recognize the true motive of these

psychiatrists and psychologists. Deep in their hearts of stone

they know that for the rulers of our world mind control does not

pay off, because it destroys the only productive capital they

have: the inventive human mind. But these scientists are

 con-
scious of the fact that in a legal frame no authority would

allow them to experiment with people in the way they are

permitted in clandestine operations. Above all mind control 
is a tragedy of science. 



If God exists he would probably [allow] mankind to do almost

everything -- wars, destruction of nature, torture -- because 
he

 vested his creatures with the gift of free will. But I'm not of

the opinion that God -- let us assume his existence -- gives

mankind the permission to compete with him in his own busi-
ness:

 the creation of souls. I'm not a believer, I'm a sceptic.

Sometimes I define myself as an atheist. But some of my

experiences during the process of mind control and later on 
made

 me inclined to believe that some kind of supernatural force 
tries

 to stop mind control in order to save the planet, because 
mind controlled human robots are a new species that will destroy 
the

 ecological balance on the earth if they become to numerous. 
Mind

 control is probably much more dangerous than nuclear or 
chemical

 weapons. But these are philosophical questions far 
beyond the scope

 of this report. This is not a general theory of 
mind control and

 not an autobiography. My aim is to convince 
the reader that mind

 control, that the production of human robots 
is not science

 fiction, because the methods necessary to 'mind 
control' people are available. The question is whether they are 
really employed.

 Before answering this question the reader should 
consider whether he believes his state [is] unscrupulous enough 
to do things like

 this secretly. Do any signs exist that the state is 
ready to

 violate the law in the name of national security? (I really
doubt that "national security" is their true motive, more often than
not "national security" seems to be a smokescreen term to justify
totalitarism fascism or socialism, or 'national socialism' -- as I 
really don't see much difference between the two other than in
the terms themselves. - Wol.) And vice versa --

 do any signs exist 
that the democratic powers are strong enough

 to exclude govern-
mental mind control? When I was mind controlled

 in a desert camp 
in 1974, a visitor FROM GERMANY came to me in

 order to give 
me the opportunity to talk for the last time with a

 fellow countryman 
shortly before my 'execution' (which of course was

 a mock execution). 
It was a good looking young man round about

 30. Afterwards he made 
an astonishing political career. Whenever

 I switch my TV on to watch 
the news the probability is very high

 to see his face. Whenever I see 
his face I am reminded who really rules my country [Germany]. Where 
mind control [is] concerned, the state acts like

 the Mafia or the Cosa 
Nostra.



The events I'm going to describe happened probably between the

 early 
50's and the early 80's. My story is exclusively based on

 my memories. 
There are three kinds of memories to consider:

 

True memories

 

False memories produced by myself.



False memories hypno-programmed by the SCNS.



It is not easy to tell these three types of memories apart. Trying
 this 
I obey the following rules:



If the memories refer to absolutely necessary elements of the

 mind 
control process, I treat them as true memories or false

 hypno-
programmed memories -- else I view them as self-deception.



If the memories are composed of elements extremely capable of

disorientating myself or others or if they are suitable to

 repress true 
memories, I believe them to be false and implanted

 by the SCNS. 



If the memories refer to concrete, vivid and clear courses of

 action 
necessary to make mind control work, then I accept them as

 true.



If I remembered mind control processes considered as true -- before

I read or heard about things like that, I assess the truth of

 these 
memories as subjectively verified. 



False memories can be implanted on top of extraordinarily severe

traumas. Embedded in our mind there is a very archaic structure

responsible for self-preservation that functions beyond rational

control. Everything connected with questions of self-preservation

will be checked by this highly emotional, primitive mental

 system. 
Because memories control behavior and behavior can lead

 to danger-
ous situations, the self-preservation system controls

 our memories, 
too. Whether a traumatic event will be forgotten or

 not depends on 
how this systems evaluates its significance for

 self-preservation.



Here are some examples:



If someone has been bitten by a dog he will not forget this
 event 
so easily because the system of self-preservation believes

 that 
remembering this will help him to avoid it in the future.
