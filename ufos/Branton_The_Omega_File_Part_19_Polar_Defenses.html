                              POLAR DEFENSES

One thing that Admiral Byrd stated in a press conference after his defeat
at Antarctica was that the Antarctic continent should be surrounded by a
"wall of defense installations since it represented the last line of
defense for America." Although the U.S. and Russia had been allies during
the war, suddenly the "Iron Curtain" was created and we and the Russians
became 'enemies'.

(Note: Some say that the animosity of the Cold War directly following WWII
was only an outward smokescreen to justify the expenditure on both sides
for massive nuclear armament buildups -- and more importantly for massive
black budget projects in space and underground -- and that in reality top
U.S. and U.S.S.R. officials met regularly via secret submarine meetings
that took place below the North Polar ice pack. This cooperation however
was not complete, as there were still many at the higher levels of U.S.
government who were against the military imperialist abuses of the
Communist system; and many at the highest levels of the U.S.S.R. who were
against the corporate imperialist abuses of the Capitalist system. 'Inner
Earth' researcher Dennis Crenshaw has written an interesting essay on the
Rockefeller influence behind Admiral Byrd's missions to the Antarctic,
stating that the Rockefeller's had funded many of Byrd's missions. Could we
imply from this that, following the war, the Rockefellers were able to
reign-in many of the lower-ranking Nazi's yet many of the higher-ranking
Nazi's slipped out of their control? The corporate elite who backed the
Nazi's apparently did not want the products of their 'investments' off
doing their own thing. Apparently the Antarctic bases, like the Russian
invasion, were NOT part of the Rockefeller's plan. However there are
suggestions that the Rockefeller-backed Nazi's in America have since made
contact with their comrades in Antarctica and have agreed to work together
-- along with the Greys -- in an effort to infiltrate America and pave the
way for it's fall and assimilation into a New World Order. As we will see
later, there are claims that some 1.5 million 'Nazis' are now operating in
various levels of American society. Just where did they come from...
Antarctica? Physicist Vladimir Terziski stated that the Nazi presence in
Antarctica has passed the 2 million mark, and therefore Antarctica might
conceivably be able to provide a large percentage of this infiltration
force. Also remember that the American, European and Antarctican 'Nazis' --
due to the very secret-society foundations of their movement -- would have
to maintain some level of contact with their occultist 'hosts' in Bavaria,
especially with the THULE and VRIL societies. - Branton)

Both the Soviets and the United States ringed the poles with defense and
detection bases, and in between was the barren no-man's-land of the poles
where absolutely nobody lived, or did they? Could it be that we pretended
we were protecting against the Russians and they pretended they were
protecting against us, while really we and they were both scared of what
was in between us -- the Nazi Last Battalion?...
