FIRE FROM THE SKY: Battle of Harvest Moon & True Story of Space Shuttles

by "One Who Knows"

PART 3:

On November 24, 1980, America's Manned Space Program suddenly started
showing signs of life after near death. It was the day when the Space
Shuttle *Columbia* was rolled out into public view at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida. It was the first public appearance by the Shuttle in
almost two years. The Shuttle arrived at Cape Canaveral two years prior, in
March of 1979.

From then until November of 1980 the Shuttle *Columbia* remained in hiding
in a very large metal cocoon called the "Orbiter Processing Facility," but
on November 24 suddenly the cocoon opened up and out popped the Space
Shuttle.

It was not a very long trip set for that day - about 300 yards to the
nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, where it disappeared once again as if by
magic. For the first time in nearly six years the United States was
committing itself in public to manned missions into space. The roll-out of
the *Columbia* took almost everyone by surprise.

America's Space Shuttle Program was a full three years behind schedule.
Since late in 1977 we heard about nothing but problems, delays, and more
problems with the Space Shuttle. In fact, just five days before, Dr. George
Low, former director of the *Apollo* Moon Program, summarized it all in
total disgust when he said, "Today I wonder whether we could start another
*Apollo,* much less accomplish it."

The *Apollo* moon landing program was another program filled with lies,
smoke and mirrors, but I will save that story for some other time. For now,
the centerfold of *Spotlight* newspaper for September 5, 1994, will give
you some hint of the lies involved.

POST-LUNAR "QUARANTINE" FARCE

Another recent source of information on this subject was an article called
"The Great Lunar Quarantine" in *Air & Space* magazine for February/March
1994. If you remember, when the moon-landing astronauts came back they had
to be quarantined for three weeks. Thinking minds questioned the reasons
for this.

On page 39, the article states: "The problem was that [the quarantine] was
all show," says Gerald Wasserburg, John D. MacArthur professor of geology
and geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, who is still
fuming 25 years later. "It really didn't prevent contamination. The people
from Fort Detrick [the Army's biological warfare facility], who really knew
how to contain pathogens, though it was ludicrous. It was all part of a
fraud, but it couldn't be stopped because it was coming from such a high
political level. Do you suppose there was some other reason for the
debriefing, er, quarantining?

SPACE SHUTTLE COUNTDOWN TO NUCLEAR WAR

After three years on hold, the countdown was under way. There was a total
air of urgency about it. Corners were being cut, safety precautions were
being overstepped, unheard of risks were being taken; and when reporters
asked why these things were being done, they received only double talk
instead of answers.

The Space Shuttle was the most complex American spacecraft built to that
point. There were more things to go wrong than ever before, and the entire
future of America's Manned Space Program depended on the shuttle. In fact,
we were told that within a few years the Shuttle would be launching
practically all American satellites.

As far as we were told, America had put all its eggs in one basket. The old
NASA would have proceeded step by step with the greatest of care. Every
manned spacecraft had made its first trip or two into space without
astronauts to insure no loss of life in case of problems.

INVISIBLE FACTIONS AT WAR

In 1981 things were done in a very strange manner indeed. The facts were,
our American Bolsheviks were getting ready for nuclear war, and a wartime
rush mentality dominated. They wanted to take out the Russians before they
got any stronger. It was a case of certain Russian and American forces at
war with other Russian and American forces! The very first Shuttle was to
be manned and was to go all the way into high orbit. There was no regard
for the safety of the astronauts; however, we did not know that they had
been training in the *Enterprise.* Remember the *Enterprise?* Whatever
happened to it, do you know? I was telling people at that time that
something fishy was going on.

For all intents and purposes, the new rocket engines of the Space Shuttle
were radically untested, as far as anyone was aware. There were three main
engines called SSMEs by NASA. Those engines had never flown into space
prior to that time; in fact, they had never so much as been fired all
together until just eight days prior to the flight.

On that day, the three engines were fired for only 20 seconds on the pad at
the Cape. NASA did not run the risk of running them longer even though
those engines were supposed to be reusable, launch after launch. Instead,
based on a mere twenty-second test, NASA would have two astronauts risk
their lives on the engines and, in the actual launch into space, the
engines would have to operate full-bore for a minimum of nine minutes.

NASA knowingly gambled that the three fresh engines on *Columbia* would
last long enough to get into orbit. The engines were only one example of
NASA's unexplained haste because if *Columbia* didn't reach orbit, the next
question was: Could it return? NASA didn't have the foggiest notion.

The recent launching of the Hubble telescope smacks of the same subterfuge
for the "duplicate" scope which was launched was truly another attempt to
fool the Russians and again the attempt was total disaster as only an evil
empire can create.

HUMPTY-DUMPTY TILES

In 1980 the new Thermo Protection Systems was radically new. All of the
previous spacecraft had "heat shields" which carried away heat by burning
away during re-entry, therefore they could be used only once. But the
Shuttle was supposed to be reusable over and over, so it required a
different kind of shield. They developed a lightweight ceramic, broken up
into more than 30,000 small pieces called "tiles." Strange thing, they said
a "few" fell off each time but not to worry, it was OK. How could it be OK?
The heat would have burned a hole where the tile was missing. I remember
they said they could not fly the *Enterprise* because they "forgot" to put
heat shields on it, then the *Enterprise* just sort of faded from the
picture. Then the *Columbia* flew with heat shields dropping off of it?
Remember? Did you notice? Did you smell a rat? I did!

For at least two years before the original launch we had been hearing tales
about problems with tiles. It began when the Shuttle *Columbia* arrived at
Cape Canaveral in March of 1979 on the back of a jumbo jet. Many tiles had
been lost or damaged during the flight and the *Columbia* looked like it
had smallpox - and that was just from riding piggyback in the atmosphere.

GROUNDED BY THE BEAR

The tile controversy made a perfect cover story to explain away the 3-year
grounding of the Space Shuttle. The real reason was that America had been
locked out of military space missions since late 1977. In August of 1977
the first pre-flight tests of the Space Shuttle took place. A Shuttle was
carried aloft aboard a jumbo jet and cut loose and guided to a landing by
the astronauts. It seemed that the age of the space shuttle was about to
dawn.

RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS IN SPACE

Russia's space program seemed completely silent. What we didn't know was
that Russia had been deploying her secret particle beam weapons in space,
and on September 17, 1977, Russia started smashing our spy satellites in
what was called the Battle of the Harvest Moon. They launched their
*Salyut-6* Space Station into orbit on September 29, 1977, and thus began a
steady stream of Russian cosmonauts back and forth into space. They even
took cosmonauts from at least seven other countries including Cuba and
Vietnam into space with them, while we just wrung our hands.

RUSSIAN BOLSHEVIKS FLOCK TO AMERICA

The Bolsheviks had been kicked out of power in Russia, and the American
Bolsheviks had been waiting long and watching for a moment of weakness
among their enemies - the secret new rulers of Russia. The Bolsheviks
wanted desperately to regain their former positions of power in Russia; but
for years, Russia's new rulers had been expelling the Bolsheviks, who then
flocked mostly to the United States.

The Bolsheviks had originally been put into power in Russia by the
Rockefeller Cartel in November 1917. They were called Communists but were
merely sadistic dictators and later had been kicked out of the Kremlin. By
the last half of 1980, they began to regain power in Russia so the decision
was made to go ahead with the space shuttle mission.

A top secret American spy satellite had been developed by the National
Reconnaissance Office, a secret project that Control Date worked on (I did
the paperwork for the people who programmed the satellite computer).

OVERT FIRST-STRIKE BY U.S. - ALMOST

Russia destroyed an American spy satellite on September 20, 1977, and a
week later put our secret Moon Base out of action. Seven months later,
Russia finished destroying all our spy and early warning satellites. Since
then, we have tried several times to deploy spy satellites to get targeting
information to launch a nuclear war, a war we have come very close to
starting several times. All we found out was the Russia had moved the
targets around and we dared not launch (although some wanted to anyway).

BOLSHEVIKS PLAN NUCLEAR FIRST STRIKE AGAINST RUSSIA

Yes, there was a full-blown plan for the U.S. to launch a first-strike
nuclear war against Russia. The nuclear first strike against Russia relied
heavily on missiles, including America's secret Minuteman TX mobile missile
(not the MX that the media talked about), but it could not succeed without
up-to-date information on the targets in Russia. The American Bolsheviks
were doing all they could to get us into a nuclear war, while they had
survival shelters for themselves (but not the rest of us!). Russia had and
has extensive survival shelters, working civil defense plans, and great
storage facilities full of wheat, corn, oats and other supplies we gave to
them (we "sold" the supplies to them, knowing they would not pay us back).

U.S. CITIZENRY TOTALLY EXPENDABLE

In the book *Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security* General
George Keegan tells of the Russian civil defense shelters. He found that
every factory in Russia had a shelter. The city of Moscow had 75
underground command post/shelters, each one the size of the Pentagon. Yes,
that's what he said. They were each covered with 100 feet of reinforced
concrete and four hundred feet of dirt. He said they were each 2 or 3 times
as strong as Hoover Dam.

Every military city in Russia and most other cities had them. Keegan said
that it would take five hundred billion dollars to build just one. I typed
that right, billion with a "B," read it again. He said they were *plush,*
they even had railroad trains going into them. They have shelters along the
road from the airport into downtown Moscow.

Russia is fully committed if necessary to fighting a nuclear war and
surviving. The United States, however, has no civil defense system at all -
except for a very exclusive system for the Elite. Our program was
officially called MAD, "Mutually Assured Destruction." However, we would
have been the only ones destroyed. If you had 20 minutes warning that
hydrogen bombs were about to be dropped all across America, WHAT WOULD YOU
DO?

I know what many of you will say. "I don't worry about it, whatever is
God's will, will be." That type of brainwashing has gotten us into this
mess. God's will, is for us to have free will. If you want to step in front
of a railroad train, God will let you. He will not stop you! And if you do
nothing about the mess you/we are in, God will let you die! If the Russians
want to attack this country, or if we want to attack them, God will allow
it - He allows free will to all sides!

The American Bolsheviks were doing all they could to get set for nuclear
war, so they were desperate for new, up-to-date reconnaissance data from
Russia. Russia knew this, that is why they finished perfecting a survival
plan. We, however, were totally expendable, then and now. We filled their
silos with survival supplies and emptied ours.

The elite Bolsheviks had, by this time, developed a satellite which they
believed could survive in orbit for a while if they launched it in secret
and took devious routes of flight.
