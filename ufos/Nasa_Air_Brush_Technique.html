                              A NASA Cover-Up





          A former employee of the National Aeronautics and Space
          Administration reveals how NASA covers up and erases
          UFOs from satelite photos. But first a little bit about
          this former employee: DONNA TIETZE HARE



          Formerly of NASA, female slide technician, the
          recipient of numerous space awards including 1969
          Apollo Achievement award from the National Aeronautics
          & Space Administration, 1973 Skylab award, a medallion
          for success on the Skylab-Suez Test project, numerous
          other awards for her skill as a technical Artist,
          honors, awards and a 1994 reccomdation by Texas
          Governor Ann Richards to the Advisory Committee of
          Psychology Associates. Donna Tietze has spent most of
          her professional life involved in the Space Program as
          a technical illustrator. She drew lunar maps, landing
          slides, she worked in the photo lab, Precision Slide
          Lab, reducing art work to one inch by one inch
          drawings. She drew launch sites, landing sites and was
          employed as a sub-contractor to NASA for over 15 years.
          She worked on flight manuals for astronauts & has the
          wonderful ability to put words into images but
          uniquely, learn to do everything backwards, including
          mathematical computations, the writing of words, to put
          it simply, this woman has seen just about all the
          different kinds of images one could see that are used
          in Space Programs.



             Donna Tietze interviewed on Washington D.C. Radio
                                  Station



          The following is a partial transcript of a radio talk
          show that occurred 5/6/95 on WOL-AM in Washington D.C.
          which is simulcast on WOLB-AM in Baltimore Maryland.
          The show is broadcast every Saturday night at 12:00am.
          The show is called "UFOs Saturday Night". The guests on
          that date were Stanley McDaniels, author of the
          McDaniel Report, Erol Toron, a cartographer and who
          provided valuable information for Richard Hoagland in
          preparing his book, "The Monuments Of Mars". Also on
          the program was keith Morgan, Dan Drazon and Donna
          Tietze, a former employee of NASA in Houston, Texas.
          The transcript was transcribed by Donald Ratsch,
          "Operation Right To Know" (ORTK) from an audio
          recording of the show. Elaine Douglass (ORTK) host of
          the show:



          Elaine Douglass: This is Elaine Douglass, WOL News-Talk
          Network, our show is UFOs Saturday night and here in
          the studio with Keith Morgan and our topic is the Face
          On Mars. We have a new guest on the air with us, Donna
          Tietze. Donna, you are also with three scientists who
          are on the air with us and that would be Stan McDaniels
          from California, Erol Toron from the east coast and Dan
          Drason whose in Colorado. The reason that I asked Donna
          to come on the show, Donna is in Houston, Texas and
          kind enough to join us tonight to tell us some very
          interesting things she observed while working at NASA.
          Donna is an educator and she is working on her Masters
          in Education. In the past Donna, as I understand it you
          held a position for 15 years with a contractor at the
          NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. You were a photo
          technician?

          Donna Tietze: Correct!



          E.D.: Donna welcome to UFOs Saturday Night. Tell me and
          tell everyone the incident that you recall as they say
          in the law court, did there come a time when you walked
          in a photo lab and someone told you something quite
          astounding? What happened that day?



          D.T.: Yes Elaine, thats true. During the Apollo mission
          I worked at NASA throughout those Apollo missions and I
          did leave NASA at the time the space shuttles began. I
          worked in building eight in the photo lab. I had a
          secret clearance so I thought I could go anywhere in
          the building. And I did go into one area that was a
          restricted area. In this area they developed pictures
          taken from satelites and also all of the missions, the
          Apollo missions, flight missions. I went in and I was
          talking to one of the photographers and developers and
          he was putting together a mosaic which is a lot of
          photos, smaller photos into a larger photo pattern. And
          while I was in there I was trying to learn new methods
          and new things about the whole organization and I was
          looking at the pictures and he directed my attention to
          one area, he said, Look at that. I looked and there was
          a round oval shaped, well it was very white circular
          shape of a dot and I, it was black & white photography,
          so I asked him if that was a spot on the emulsion and
          he said, well I can't tell you but spots on the
          emulsion do not leave round circles of shadows.



          E.D.: So there was a shadow on the ground?



          D.T.: Right, a round shadow! And I noticed that there
          were pine trees, now I don't know where this area was
          or what, you, pretty close to the ground what I saw but
          I didn't see outline of the continent. But I did notice
          that thre was shadow under this white dot and I also
          noticed that the trees were casting the shadows in the
          same direction as this shadow of the circle of this
          aerial phenomena because it was higher than the trees
          but not too much higher than the trees but it was close
          to the ground and it was spherical but slightly
          elongated, not very much but slightly. I then said, is
          it a UFO? And he said, Well I can't tell you. And then
          I asked him, what are you going to do with this piece
          of information? And he said, well we have to airbrush
          these things out before we sell these photographs to
          the public. So I realized at that point that there is a
          procedure setup to take care of this type of
          information from the public.



          E.D.: Isn't that remarkable gentlemen?



          Stan McDaniels: Elaine, I was unable to really hear
          very much of that.



          E.D.: Oh really?



          SmcD: I did catch air brush it out.



          E.D.: Alright, Stan can you hear this station break
          coming up?



          SmcD: Uh, sure.



          E.D.: So alright, we are going into that, we'll be back
          in just a couple of minutes



          BREAK



          E.D.: Erol Toron, you are here?



          E.T.: I'm still here



          E.D.: Alright fine, Stan you said you could not hear
          the account that Donna gave?



          SmcD: Not very well.



          E.D.: Alright, Keith would you like to recapitulate
          what Donna said?



          Keith Morgan: Stan, what she said was that she was in
          the photo lab at NASA and that she was looking at some
          photos and one showed an elliptical object, white
          object that was casting a shadow on the ground above
          some trees and the technician in there, she asked him
          if it was a UFO? He said I can't tell you. She said
          what are you going to do with this kind of information?
          He said well that is the kind of stuff that we airbrush
          out.



          SmcD: Oh I see, thanks for that!



          E.D. So Donna thats approximately, essentially correct
          what you said, right?



          D.T. Right!



          E.D.: Yes well I, Stan I think thats quite startling,
          don't you?



          SmcD: Its speaks for itself.



          E.D.: Yes it certainly does, Now Donna there is another
          matter that you learned about when you were there at
          NASA. I believe this was through a third party, a
          person that you were spending some time with who was a
          fellow NASA employee?



          D.T.: Right, in fact after we talked, I thought about
          another incident with a guard that I would like to
          convey too thats very important. This man that I had
          dated was in quarantine with the astronauts when they
          had come back from the moon and I had talked to him
          about seeing this saucer (satellite photos) and asked
          him if he had heard anything about that and he told me
          that every astronaut, every moon trip had been followed
          by craft, by saucers, that every one of them, every
          astronaut that went to the moon, now I don't know about
          other sites but they all had seen it and all had been
          told to keep quite about it and they were threatened
          with jail and their whole retirement, everything taken
          away from them. They were also, this told me that if I
          ever told that he said it, that he would deny it, that
          he would never admit that he told me all of that.



          E.D.: Did you hear that Stan?



          SmcD: No



          E.D.: Alright, ah, go ahead Keith, recapitulate.



          (Keith repeats everything of that part that Donna
          Tietze stated, to McDaniel)



          SmcD: Oh yes I see



          E.D.: Yes and I believe that Donna you related to me,
          you friend came to believe that the UFOs were
          instrumental in geting Apollo 13 that was, ah, our
          disable mission to the moon, was it 13?



          D.T.: Right, well he said that it shouldn't have come
          back, I mean, there was no, ah, they had help. And
          thats was all he would say.



          E.D.: All he would say?



          D.T.: He said it was impossible for that craft to have
          gotten back home



          E.D.: Donna you said that there was another matter that
          you wanted to relate to us.



          D.T.: Yes, something that I didn't talk to you about
          earlier. When I had quite work, I had an office, I was
          doing ilustration work at another office, in another
          part of town. And a man that had been a guard at NASA
          during the time came into my office and he had a large
          gash scar on his forehead and he told me that he was a
          guard at NASA and that he was burning a lot of
          photographs of UFOs. That was his job.



          E.D.: Really (surprised)



          D.T.: And he said he stopped to look at one too long
          and one of the other, I gathered it was some type of
          military man, hit him in the head with a gun butt and
          knocked him out.



          E.D.: What? (shocked)



          D.T.: Because he had looked at one of the photographs
          too long, he did describe the photograph to me which I
          tend to believe was an accurate photograph.



          E.D: Oh, my god!



          D.T.: He explained that it was a craft on the ground
          and it looked like, it was like a regular saucer with
          like little bumps all over and he said it was like it
          was burnt. He said cows in the field all had their
          tails stuck straight up. At the time he said he didn't
          know when cattle were frightened, that their tails
          would stick staight up. And he described this to me and
          since then, I did describe it to someone that I thought
          might have looked at some of these photos, possibly and
          they did look kind of frightened that I shouldn't know
          about that one.



          (the next several minutes later the conversation is
          more about UFOs following Apollo crafts to the moon)



          E.D.: The second part of her account had to do with the
          stalking of our space mission by UFOs of our space
          missions to the moon and so on. She even said that they
          apparently helped in one case by bringing the Apollo 13
          back, that was the impression that she got and..



          D.T.: yes but they (aliens) also didn't want that craft
          to investigate

          the part of the moon that they was going to, so they
          may have caused

          some of it too, but it was supposed, we were told not
          to go but we

          ignored it. Now thats what I've heard, that some of the
          stuff he was

          telling me.



          E.D. Did he say that, your direct contact?



          D.T.: Yes!



          E.D.: That the United States was told not to go to the
          moon?



          D.T.: To that certain place on the back side of the
          moon.



          E.D.: And did he know why we weren't supposed to go
          there?



          D.T.: I guess they didn't want us to see something back
          there, I don't know, I don't know that part.



          (interview winds down a few minutes later and the show
          is out of time)
