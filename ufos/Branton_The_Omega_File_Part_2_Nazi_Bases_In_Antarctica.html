                          NAZI BASES IN ANTARCTICA

We will now examine the various claims of Nazi bases in Antarctica, which
as we have said, may very well have been the point-of-origin of the
'Nazi-Grey' craft that Barney and Betty Hill encountered during their
abduction experience.

The historical facts are evident. Beginning in 1838, long before the end of
the Second World War, the Nazi's commenced to send out numerous exploratory
missions to the Queen Maud region of Antarctica. A steady stream of
expeditions were reportedly sent out from [at the time] white supremacist
South Africa. Over 230,000 square miles of the frozen continent were mapped
from the air, and the Germans discovered vast regions that were
surprisingly free of ice, as well as warm water lakes and cave inlets. One
vast ice cave within the glacier was reportedly found to extend 30 miles to
a large hot-water geothermal lake deep below. Various scientific teams were
moved in to the area, including hunters, trappers, collectors and
zoologists, botanists, agriculturists, plant specialists, mycologists,
parasitologists, marine biologists, ornithologists, and many others.
Numerous divisions of the German government were involved in the top secret
project.

This is where the mainstream historians leave off, as only revisionist
historians will dare consider the implications of the rest of the story...

After all the data was gathered, deep underground construction teams came
pouring into the renamed "Neu-Schwabenland". They came on cargo ships,
military transport ships, and submarines. The cargo ships coming from South
Africa were protected by a host of killer-submarines and military ships.
This might explain the intense Nazi war efforts in North and South Africa.
Any ship that even came close to the shipping routes from South Africa to
Antarctica were destroyed by German U-boats to protect the secret. After
all the goods were brought, the VIPs and scientists started to show up with
a compliment of ULTRA, a highly specialized Nazi SS team like our MJ-12.
ULTRA has always been in control of Antarctica. ULTRA is the name of a
secret alien interface agency in the NSA. Remember that the NSA has
connections to both the Nazi S.S. and the Dulce base. According to
contactee Alex Collier, the upper level members of the NSA-ULTRA group are
cloned replicates or have been so heavily implanted, virtual cyborgs, that
they could be considered as being barely human -- automatons who are
remotely controlled by the Greys' group ego or group mind. It is also
noteworthy that ULTRA is also the NAME OF the Above Top Secret
CIA-NSA-Alien base under the Archuleta plateau and peak northeast of DULCE,
New Mexico. This might also explain Valdamar Valerian's insistence that
early newspaper clippings just prior to the outbreak of World War II imply
that "the Germans" were "all over" New Mexico exploring caves and mines,
buying up property, and engaging in all sorts of mysterious activities.
Could Antarctica be the real power behind the New World Order? If the Nazi
bases still exist in Antarctica then they would no doubt still have secret
contact with the Bavarian cults which sponsored and were an integral part
of the Nazi party, like the Bavarian THULE society for instance.

It is interesting that the re-united East and West Germany is paving the
way for the 'unification' of Europe. For instance, all economic bar-codes
must be processed through Germany, Germany is trying to impose enforced
nepotistic career restrictions where one's career is determined by the
family one is born into, a British news agency spoke of investigations of
the Bavarian secret service who were reportedly smuggling weapons grade
plutonium into Germany from a nuclear black market operation they had
established in the former Soviet States, the Illuminati has its base in
Germany [Bavaria], and Germany has been the most active country in the
international drive for Internet censorship and control. In other words,
Democracy seems to be dying a painful death in Germany, IF it ever really
existed there in the first place. As for Neu Schwabenland, the construction
and secret projects in Antarctica continued throughout the entire course of
the war.

Just before the end of the WWII, two German provision U-boats, U-530 and
U-977, were launched from a port on the Baltic Sea. Reportedly they took
with them members of the antigravity-disk research and development teams
[ULTRA], and the LAST of the most vital disc components [much of this
technology and hardware had been transported to the base during the course
of the war]. This included the notes and drawings for the latest saucer or
aerial disk designs, and designs for the gigantic underground complexes and
living accommodations based on the remarkable underground factories of
Nordhausen in the Harz Mountains. The two U-boats duly reached the new land
of Neu-Schwabenland where they unloaded everything. When they arrived in
Argentina several months later, their crews were captured. It seems as if
they were either counting on the formerly German-friendly Argentineans to
allow them access, or it could have been that they intentionally allowed
themselves to be discovered for misinformation purposes, i.e. -- "yes... we
are the last two renegade German subs. We've been trying to hold out
but...oops, you caught us... the war's finally over!"

The crews of these U-Boats were of course interrogated by U.S. Intelligence
agents who had suspected the existence of the Antarctic base. Whatever the
Nazi soldiers tried to tell them, apparently the Americans were not
convinced... especially considering the subsequent and ill-fated U.S. Navy
backed military actions against the Nazi's "Last Battalion" in Antarctica
in later years under Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who arrived at Antarctica
with an entire military armada and provisions to last 6 month. However the
the entire expedition lasted only 8 weeks, with only approximately three
weeks of actual full-scale Antarctic operations.

The Antarcticans were desperate following the war, and knew that a
confrontation was imminent. Much effort was put into developing secret
weapons projects to defend their new underground Empire, which no doubt was
constructed with the 'help' of a large number of expendable slave laborers
transported from the concentration camps of Europe.

The major base-city of Antarctica became known as the NEW BERLIN, or by the
code-named "Base-211".

The actual beginnings of German interest in the polar regions may date back
BEFORE the earliest U.S. Navy polar expeditions. For instance one segment
of NOVA related that the remains of Capt. Charles Hall of the ill-fated
POLARIS expedition, one of the first American ventures to the North Pole,
were discovered in an ice grave by a subsequent polar expedition. It seemed
that when the body was examined it was found to contain poison. It was also
discovered by searching the records that the cook [who would be in the
perfect position to administer poison] and the first mate on the Polaris
expedition were German Occultist spies! Remember that the German secret
societies of Bavaria, which had helped to precipitate the first and second
world wars, date back to ancient times when -- following the occupation of
Egypt -- the [un]'Holy Roman Empire' military forces based in Germany, the
seat of government for the HO.R.E, brought back from Egypt the black
gnostic "serpent cults" which later gave rise to the Bavarian Illuminati,
the Bavarian Thule Society and a host of other lesser known satanic racist
cults which gravitated around these. Could the occultist spies who
sabotaged the POLARIS expedition have been attempting to protect a secret
hidden deep within the polar regions? Could this secret have had something
to do with an ancient collaboration between Bavarian satanic cults and
reptilian-based aliens?

A German Polar researcher who we will identify only as 'Stefan' reveals
that the 'historical' beginnings of German interest and research into the
Antarctic or South Polar region itself began in 1873 when Sir Eduard
Dallman on behalf of the newly founded German Society of Polar Research
discovered new Antarctic routes with his ship 'GRONLAND'.

"...Dallman discovered the "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Inseln" at the western entrance
of the Biskmarkstrasse along the Biscoue Islands. Exploring the polar
regions, the Germans were already at this time quite innovative, for the
'GRONLAND' was the first steamship to see the Antarctic ice at all.

"Within the next 60 years 2 further expeditional thrusts took place, and
two complete expeditions were fulfilled, namely 1910 under Wilhem Filchner
with his ship 'DEUTSCHLAND'; and 1925 with the special designed polar
expedition ship, the 'METEOR' under the command of Dr. Albert Merz.

"During the recent years before WWII the Germans claimed to hegemony about
parts of Antarctica and the wish to possess [their] own base grew stronger.
At this time the Antarctic was not safe due to international treaties like
today and a pragmatic proof of Germany's claim by a single strike to the
south pole on the eve of the war seemed to be the best option. Hitler
himself was anxious for a foothold in the Antarctic and such a claim could
be used pretty well for the Nationalsocialistic propaganda and a further
demonstration of the uprising "Superpower Germany". On the other side a new
provocation of the Allies had still to be avoided for some time. Germany
was -- at this time -- not completely prepared for the coming war.

"As a matter of fact, the idea of a semi-civilian expedition in cooperation
with the German national airline company, the 'LUFTHANSA' grew up. A
civilian covered expedition with truly military and strategical background,
a highly political charged balancing act. The command on this strike was
given to the polar-experienced Captain Alfred Ritscher, who had already led
some expeditions to the North Pole and proved courage and skillness in
critical situations. The selected ship was the 'MS SCHWABENLAND, a German
aircraft carrier used since 1934 for transatlantic mail delivery by special
flightboats, the famous 'Dornier Wale'. These 'Wales' were mounted on steam
catapults on the deck of the ship and could be started and refueled this
way easily. This circumstance should proof very well during the expedition.

"The 'SCHWABENLAND' was prepared for the expedition on Hamburg's shipyards,
which cost the huge amount of 1 Million Reichsmark, nearly a third of the
complete expedition budget.

"Meanwhile, the crew was prepared and scheduled by the German Society of
Polar Research precisely. This society also made the sensational step to
invite Richard E. Byrd, the most famous American Antarctic researcher. On
the mid of November 1938 he arrived in Hamburg and showed the crew and a
clearly selected publicity of 84 persons his new Antarctic dokumentation
movie in the Urania of Hamburg. Byrd, who had flown across the south pole
as the first human in 1929, was already at this time a living legend, a
national hero to the Americans and most of the polar researchers. In 1938
he still was civilian. This invitation to the Germans could have been a
typical irony of history, for nearly ten years later exactly this Richard
E. Byrd -- then in the rank as US NAVY admiral -- got the instruction to
destroy the secret German Antarctic base 211. To do this, he was given the
command of the biggest military force on the Antarctic ice ever seen, 13
ships and nearly 4000 men staff. That mysterious operation which is said to
have ended in a catastrophical failure.

"The 'NEUSCHWABENLAND' left the port of Hamburg on December 17th 1938
heading to the Antarctic on a precisely planned and determined route and
reached the ice on January 19th 1939 at 4&#176; 15&#180; W and 69&#176;
10&#180;S. The following weeks on 15 flights the 'PASSAT' and the 'BOREAS'
flew across some 600.000 square kilometers and made with their special
designed German "Zeiss Reihenmessbildkameras RMK 38" more than 11.000
pictures of the area. The old Norwegian maps from 1931 on these areas were
renewed, for they proved to be fake. [Could not be different, because the
Norwegian expeditions before did never go so deep into the ice from the
used Northern landing point]. Nearly one fifth of the whole Antarctic area
was scanned this way, thus documented for the first time and simultaneous
claimed to be German territory. To stress this claim on the outside too,
the two planes dismissed several thousands of drop-flags, special metal
poles with expedition's insignia on them, the 'swastika'. The whole
territory now got the still valid name: 'NEUSCHWABENLAND', referring to a
south German region [which is actually not far from me here].

"Interestingly, the Expedition seemed to have discovered ice-free areas
with even lakes and small signs of vegetation in the mid of the Antarctic.
The geologists said that this phenomenon was due hot sources in the ground.
Concurrent, the landings points where marked with "prick-flags".

"Notes: Some newer historians reduce the discovered area to an amount of
325.000 square kilometers. Do not trust these numbers, I have copies of the
original flight maps here, revealing the number 600.000 in ancient letters.
What could be the reason to reduce this number?

"Most parts of 'NEUSCHWABENLAND' were renamed according to the Antarctic
treaty in 1957. Look out for "QUEEN MAUD LAND"., "PRINCESS MARTHA COAST",
"PRINCESS ASTRID COAST". On the older maps you will still find the original
names. Yet, until today still many of the mountains in the northern
Antarctic area carry German names like: "M_HLIG-HOFFMAN-MOUNTAINS",
"WOHLTAT-MOUNTAINS", etc. These names were given according to leading
Berlin bureaucrats who enabled with their policy the expedition's targets.

"In the mid of February, the 'SCHWABENLAND' again left the Antarctic. It
took two months back to Hamburg and Ritscher carefully used this time to
organize the results, maps and photos. Captain Ritscher surprised by the
results of the flights, immediately planned after the arrival a second,
fully civilian, expedition in use of lighter airplanes with skids. Facing
the beginning of WWII, these civilian (!) plans were said to be given up
somewhere on October 1939.

"Yet, what about the military and strategic option achieved by this strike?
Was it wasted resources so far? Today, all historians agree in the fact
that WWII was not accidentally started but pretty well planned from the
early 30's and even before. At least since 1933 (incidentally the same year
when one of the first 'official' treaties between the Greys and Bavarian
Intelligence was initiated -- no doubt with more than a little help from
the secret societies operating there - Branton) the whole German
dictatorship tried to gain war fitness within a decade or earlier. In all
-- and I really mean all -- aspects of life: military, 'civilian',
economic, social, private, resourcing, engineering, foreign policy, and so
on, in all aspects the Germans were put straight on their way to war more
or less obviously. Pointing to this only aim, the Nationalsocialists abused
the typical kind of German correctness and missing sense for rebellious
scrutinizing. Nothing was left to chance! And this same method was used in
the Antarctic issue, which in my eyes NEVER ended with Ritscher's return
[in] 1938 but went on during the WWII.

"Unfortunately, at this point all valid information has vanished. What is
left is a scattered puzzle of hints, testimonies and reports which go up to
the fifties and which we partially can not verify anymore. So IF the
Germans WERE able to build up an Antarctic [underground] base on the
results of Ritscher's expedition, this would be one of the really best
covered secrets in German history. No question, German engineers HAD the
knowledge to construct something like that as the huge underground
establishments of the Nordhausen complex in the Harz as well as Kahla
complex at Thuumlringen and many more prove. Does this remind you Americans
of something??? The pattern somehow is the same: A lying government /
dictatorship and a frightened, blind-held folks willing to obey and believe
in what they are fed up with...[see Roswell].

"So, what we did in Part II ... was the attempt to restructure chronically
those parts of the puzzle we could gather within some months of research on
this topic. Nobody can say that the following really happened, so you might
see it as speculation first. Yet, we HAVE tremendous parallels on several
sources from which we can only say this one thing 100%ly: THEY COULD NOT
HAVE KNOWN OF EACH OTHER!

"What follows now is the attempt of a chronological collection of the
events and their conclusions as far as they are known to us today. They all
lead to the establishing of the Antarctic base 211 at the end of war by
means of German submarines and flying saucers and to the [failed ?] attempt
to destroy it by the US Navy in 1947.

(Note: The following are brief descriptions or synopsis' of information and
documentation which 'Stefan' has in his possession, yet which we will not
quote in their entirety here. - Branton):

"-- Evaluation of the anti-gravity propulsion of a nearly 100% functional
flying saucer going down in the 'Schwarzwald' in the summer 1936.
"-- Alternative hypothesis: Self-developing this propulsion by experiments
of German scientists basing on Viktor Schauberger's anti-gravity
experiments.
"-- First unmanned flights with the new [re-]built propulsion. A very
special section of the "Reichsluftfahrtbehoumlrde" gets the project under
its control with the aim to build up anti-gravital fighters and
troop-carriers. The project's name is 'HANEBBU' [some sources also call it
the 'VRIL' project]. The prototypes are numbered in ascending order. The
project has many setbacks in the first years due to the massive
electro-magnetic disturbances and their interaction with conventional
electric components. Although the propulsion can be handled and used
principally, it seems to be nearly impossible to "drive or fly" these
prototypes in sharper angels than 90¦, thus not usable as fighters.
Additionally normal navigation systems referring somehow to magnetic fields
were completely useless and special magnetic independent navigation
instrumentation designed, the celestial guidance system: "Meisterkompass"
and "Peiltochterkompass".
"-- Further secret German expeditions to 'NEUSCHWABENLAND'. As landing
points, there could have been used two of the three marked landing bays
north-west of the "HLIG-HOFFMAN MOUNTAINS" close to 3&#176; W and 70&#176;
S. Those were already documented as 'landing bays' by Ritscher. "--
Starting the assemblage of the Antarctic base 211. Simultaneously a second
secret base is build up on a high plateau in the South American Andes.
[Argentina ?]
"-- Necessary items for the erection of the bases are continuously
transported on submarines. Note: German submarine commanders are highly
experienced in the Arctic waters due to the need of delivery of material
and people to Germany's northern Arctic bases and civilian research
stations. In fact at least 20 well documented operations have taken place
along the Arctic until 1945 by means of these submarines. Some of these
operations, especially the later ones, had to be carried out under extreme
conditions and with the permanent threat of contact with the enemy.
Besides, on their way to the south pole, researchers discovered somewhat
like a straight deep submarine trench fitting pretty well for the necessary
transportation's.
"-- The 'HANNEBU' series has left the stadium of prototypes and brought up
to 19-25 ships in 2 [or even 3] sizes. "HANEBU I" is a small vessel,
"HANNEBU II" a more sophisticated, larger one. Some reports even hint at
"HANNEBU III", which was designed as a mothership. If this third type has
become reality, there existed only one single ship. So, the overall
transport capacities are still very limited, due to a quite small diameter
of the disks. Additionally production of ships gets more and more
difficult, because the Allies managed to cut of Germany's raw materials
more and more. Yet 'HANNEBUs' managed to disturb some allied bomber raids
over Germany. Note: Every allied bomber pilot in the [latter] years of the
war knew the mysterious threat of the so called "foe-fighters" appearing
and vanishing with incredible speed and causing bright-orange light
phenomenon's and paroxysmal instrumentation failures on all electric and
magnetic parts of the bombers. In no source a direct attack by these
"foe-fighters" is mentioned, they seem to play a completely defensive role
on the late air war over Germany.
(Note: see the movie, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, which correctly implies that
the Germans were on the verge of developing a whole range of incredible new
aerial weapons, and needed to prolong the war for a few more months in
order to get their new jets, etc., into production, and the Battle of the
Bulge was a part of this plan. However just as these new weapons were about
to go into mass production the German military failed to fully succeed in
their battle plans to buy more time and prolong the war for a few more
months, and the Allied invasion of Germany began. That particular victory
may have been closer than most of us would dare to believe. If the
'Nazis/Antarcticans' are planning for another planetary takeover, then this
time they may have an alien force working with them. Could the abductions
and implantation's by 'aliens' be a joint CIA-Nazi-Alien project to
implement electronic mind control programming on millions of people
throughout the nations in preparation for the attempted implimentation of
an electronically-controlled New World Order dictatorship? - Branton)
"-- The enormous pressure of the Allies force the Germans to give up the
big secret underground facilities in Eastern Germany. The Allies themselves
seem to be pretty well informed on these facilities and overall eager to
capture them. The Germans flee and leave back much material of the
'HANNEBU' project. Their attempt to rebuild the construction zones in the
middle of Germany fails. The war is nearly over. "Quotations: "... I have
seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they
[the Germans] had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would
have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in
air warfare.
" -- Sir Roy Feddon, chief of the technical mission to Germany for the
Ministry for Aircraft Production in 1945. "When WWII ended, the Germans had
several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development.
The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only
known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported to
UFO observers...
" -- Captain Edward J. Ruppelt Chief of the US Air Force Project 'Bluebook'
on 1956. "Notes:
"-- A last convoy of submarine vessels leaves German Harbors with direction
to Antarctica and Andes. It is the overall successful attempt to escape the
Allies' clutches. Among this last convoy there are the U 530 [Captain Otte
Wehrmut] and the U977m [Captain Heinz Schaumlffer].
"-- The last visual contact with U977 was on April 26th at Christiansund.
Schaumlffer's crew did not reveal anything about the submarine's
destination or load. The vessel vanishes now for nearly 4 months, before
the crew delivers a completely empty vessel to Argentinian Officials.
"-- In the same way, leading NS-Officials and technicals are evacuated from
Berlin/Potsdam with the HANEBU fleet heading to the meanwhile COMPLETED (?)
base 211. The overall transport capacities are quite limited.
"-- The submarine convoy achieves in the southern Atlantic Sea a sea
victory over an Allied unit trying to stop it. This event is under wraps
until today.
"-- Germany's capitulation [to the Allies] 17 August 1945.
"-- Some submarine crews who are not willing to live in the base or who
perhaps can't be admitted to the base travel to Argentine and hand over
their completely empty submarines.
"-- Among those are the documented cases of U530 and U977. High US NAVY
officials immediately traveled down to Argentine and started severe
interrogations on the crew. Scgaumlffer repeatedly denied to have brought
anyone or anything to anywhere. Although most of the crew are unwilling to
tell what really happened, it is possible that these interrogations deliver
important information about the location of the base. (Note: One source has
claimed that the information the interrogators recieved involved the escape
of Adolph Hitler, Martin Boorman, Eva Braun and a major segment of the Nazi
leadership -- not including those who were 'sacrificed' to the Nuremberg
trials after the war -- to the South Polar base. This source claimed that
these interrogations ultimately LED to the military action against the
entrenched Nazi forces in Antarctica under the command of Navy Admiral
Richard E. Byrd. - Branton). Yet for us, it remains very mysterious what
the crew really did after the official capitulation on May 1945, for they
confessed to have heard it soon on their own radio. When Schaumlffer came
free, he immediately traveled back to Argentina to stay there with some
fellows for the rest of his life.

(Note: Others claim that a large number of 'Antarcticans' have infiltrated
South America via Argentina, and in turn North America -- where the Nazi
"UFO" forces have reportedly established several underground bases. They
are reportedly working with "Paperclip" Nazis, members of various Bavarian
fraternal cults, and Anglo-American corporate fascicts above, in a plan to
bring down America by creating a fascist revolution in the United States,
like the one that brought the Nazi's to power in Germany. The concentration
camps, thousands of train cars equipped with shackles, and executive orders
for the implementation of martial law are already in place. - Branton)

"-- Until today more than 100 submarines of the German fleet are missing.
Among those are many of the highly technological XXII class equipped with
the so-called 'Walterschnorchel', a special designed and coated schnorkel
enabling submarines in combination with their new developed engines to dive
for many thousand miles. A 'trip' to the base without recognition becomes
pretty possible with this technology.
"-- The US Navy tries to destroy the German base which did not surrender at
the end of war. The operation is a disaster. The base remains functional,
at least in parts.
"-- More than one year after the surrendering of U977 the US NAVY launches
the biggest military operation in the Antarctic ice under the command of
Admiral Richard E. Byrd. This is the operation 'HIGHJUMP', including 13
ships, 1 aircraft carrier, 2 seaplane tenders, 6 two-engined R4D transports
and 4000 men. The only official statement on the purpose of such a task
force is the need for testing "new material under the extreme Antarctic
conditions." The force starts up at the established US bases in the "ROSS
SEA", then it moves up the western Antarctic coast heading toward the
Northern Antarctic coast, 'NEUSCHWABENLAND' and building up a bridgehead on
January 27th 1947 somewhere west of it. Officially the expedition is a big
success because it delivers many new facts of the use of military equipment
under extreme conditions. "-- What is the need of such a big task force in
this area? IF the expedition was such a success, WHY did Byrd already
return to the US in February 1947? The operation was planned and equipped
for a full 6-8 month duration. Did this expedition carry atomic warheads as
some sources say?

(Note: although the entire expedition lasted some 8 weeks as suggested
earlier, some sources claim that the actual battle -- once Byrd's forces
had been divided into three main battle groups on the continent of
Antarctica -- lasted only 3 weeks. - Branton)

"-- Byrd flew in 1947 at least one time in a right-twisted circle across
the whole territory 'NEUSCHWABENLAND' heading from southwest over the
'RITSCHER HOCHLAND' and the eastern areas to the Pole. On his return to the
US, Byrd reveals in an [often quoted but nowhere validated] interview with
a reporter that it was "necessary for the USA to take defensive actions
against enemy air fighters which come from the polar regions" and that in
case of a new war, the USA would be attacked by fighters that are able to
fly from one pole to the next with incredible speed". (Actually this quote
HAS been validated, as will be seen later on in this document - Branton).
Byrd has to face a secret cross-examination by US authorities. The US
withdraws from the Antarctic for almost a decade. (Note: Another claim
which has been made by certain investigators, although the original source
is difficult to track down, was that upon returning to the States Admiral
Byrd went into a rage before the President and Joint Chiefs of Staff and in
an almost demanding tone, strongly 'suggested' that Antarctica be turned
into a thermonuclear test range. - Branton)
"-- World wide mass sightings of UFOs. In the late 70's it becomes more and
more obvious that many of these sightings are identical in some technical
details with the 'HANEBU' series. This can be stated especially for the so
called 'ADAMSKI' UFOs in the early fifties which somehow look very
terrestrial, nearly in "fashion style" of this decade and somehow very
different from the rest of flat-bottomed crafts.
"-- The International Antarctic year with large civilian research projects
starts. The result is the Antarctic treaty in which all participants agree
to avoid any military operations this region in future times. This treaty
