Unfortunately I don't have access to anonymous FTP.  If you want to

|MUSTANG - Owners said no cause can be found for the two     |
|mutilated black cattle, which were found dead in fields     |
|about 60 miles apart, followins a full moon.                |
|The cattle, in Canadian and Blaine counties, had their      |
|sex organs removed.                                         |
|Mustang Police Chief Ron Lewis said his office              |
|recently investigated the mutilation of a 1,100- pound      |
|Angus cow. Blaine County Undersheriff Kent Sexton said      |
|his office was called to the ranch of Galen Slagell near    |
|Hydro the same morning to investigate the mutilation of     |
|a 70-pound Angus steer. Although Lewis said he is not       |
|versed on cults, he thinks some type of cult                |
|celebration that coincides with Passover might be           |
|responsible for the mutilations.  Lewis and Sexton          |
|said their investigations turned up some similarities. No   |
|blood was found at the scene of either mutilation, and      |
|Lewis and Sexton said both cattle appeared to be "drained   |
|of blood." The interior and exterior sex organs, tongues    |
|and one eye from each animal had been removed. The cow      |
|found in Canadian County was missing her left ear and       |
|a patch of hide over her ribs on the right side.  The       |
|cow's owner, who asked not to be identified, said he        |
|wonders what "idiots" would mutilate an animal, and he      |
|would like to have the cow's death solved. He said he       |
|checked his cattle the evening before the mutilation. "I    |
|had just worked them and I knew I didn't have any sick      |
|ones. When I went to check them, I saw her and I knew she   |
|was dead by the way she was laying." He said he was         |
|angry at first because he thought someobe had shot her      |
|and left her for the coyotes. A closer look showed him      |
|the mutilation was not the work of coyotes. There were      |
|some droPs of blood on the ground, but no blood came from   |
|any of the wounds. He said this was odd because when        |
|someone shoots a cow, a death struggle occurs and there     |
|is a lot of blood. He also said the cow was in an           |
|area of dirt and there were no tracks, neither human or     |
|animal around her.                                          |
|"When I walked up, I left tracks," he said.                 |
|He said he checked the animal carefully and could not       |
|find a cause of death. The cow's death will continue to     |
|be a problem. Her 4-month-old calf, which would not         |
|normally be weaned for another two months, now will not     |
|grow as rapidly, and the cow had been bred and was about    |
|two months pregnant. Undersheriff Sexton said it had        |
|rained before the steer was found near Hydro and the        |
|ground was soft. "There were no prints,'i Sexton said. He   |
|said he has been around cattle all his life, and "this      |
|wasn't coyotes." Ranch owner Slagell agreed: "I don't       |
|know of any coyotes that carry knives." Sexton said         |
|veterinarian Tim Lowry also couldn't find a bullet hole.    |
|"We're baffled." he said. Although Lowry said, "There       |
|definitely was a human hand involved," Slagell said he      |
|was still not ruling out the possibility that the           |
|mutilation could have been done by vultures. : But Blaine   |
|County Assistant District attorney George Burnett said      |
|the steer "obviously was surgically cut ... If someone      |
|saw something, it may help us solve the case."              |
