 [PART 37]
 
The following article comes from the 'TC TECHNICAL CONSULTANT', 
Nov.-Dec., 1991 issue:

     "The DEATH of a journalist in West Virginia, plus the jailing of
an alleged CIA computer consultant in Washington State may be 
elements of a much wider scandal that could have serious impli-
cations for the Bush White House in 1992.
     "What started out as an investigation of an apparent case of
pirated software has grown to be a project involving hundreds of
journalists all over the world.
     "The dead journalist, Joseph Daniel 'Danny' Casolaro was
found dead August 10th in a motel room in West Virginia.  His
wrists were slashed SEVEN times on EACH wrist and a suicide 
note was found nearby.  The only manuscript of his book, with 
accompanying notes, WAS MISSING.
     "The book, provisionally titled 'The Octopus', was meant to 
be an explosive expose of misdeeds by the Justice Department 
under the Reagan administration.  Time Magazine also reported
that Casolaro's research centered on gambling and attempted 
arms deals at the CABAZON reservation near Indio (California -
Wol.).
     "Indeed, the scope of Casolaro's investigation was so large 
that any one of a large number of areas of research could have
been the trigger for a possible hit.
     "While authorities declared his death a suicide, his relatives 
definitely stated that Casolaro's mental state was sound, indeed
upbeat, after the completion of his book.
     "Casolaro started his work nearly two years before, investi-
gating the bankrupting of a small computer software company 
called Inslaw, allegedly by the U.S. Justice Department.  INSLAW, 
a company headed by Bill and Nancy Hamilton of Washington
D.C., had developed a package known as PROMIS -- short for
Prosecutor's Management Information System -- to act as a case
management tool for the Justice Department's unwieldy work load.
     "Inslaw President Bill Hamilton [NOT the well-known Ufologist -
Wol.] has claimed that Ed Meese associate EARL BRIAN was given 
control of pirated versions of the PROMIS software by Meese to sell 
back to different U.S. government agencies for great profit.  Two courts 
have so far agreed with Hamilton awarding an 8 million dollar judgment, 
but a higher court of appeal has quashed the award and the verdict, 
declaring that it was not the jurisdiction of the lower courts [Note: But
of course the 'higher courts' are run by -- you guessed it -- the Justice
{sic} Department. - Wol.].  As of October 9, the case has moved into 
the realm of the Supreme Court.
     "EARL BRIAN OWNS UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL (UPI) 
and FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK (FNN).  
     "According to a Washington man, who claims to have modified
the cobol-based software FOR THE CIA and other intelligence agen-
cies, the software was a reward for Earl Brian's role in arranging 
the so-called 'October Surprise' gambit, the alleged conspiracy to 
withhold the American hostages in Iran until after the 1980 elect-
ion which saw Carter removed from power.  The 'October Surprise'
scandal has taken some time to emerge.
     "In a Paris meeting, President Bush is alleged to have met 
with Ali Akabar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Iranian
Parliament, Mohammed Ali Rajai, the future President of Iran and
Manucher Ghorbanifar, an Iranian arms dealer with connections 
to Mossad, according to Navy Captain Gunther Russbacher who 
claims to have flown Bush, William Casey -- the CIA chief -- and 
Donald Gregg, a CIA operative to that location.  Russbacher, who 
made these allegations in May is now in jail on Terminal Island,
convicted (falsely, many claim. - Wol.) on the charge of imperson-
ating a U.S. Attorney.
     "The Washington man is MICHAEL RICONOSCIUTO who is 
now waiting for a trial in a Washington jail on conspiracy to sell
drugs charges, charges which Riconosciuto claims are MANUFAC-
TURED.  Indeed, the charge made against Riconosciuto were made 
ONE WEEK AFTER Riconosciuto authored and signed an affidavit
describing his role in modifying the pirated software.
     "The affidavit also claimed that he had been contacted by 
phone and threatened by PETER VIDENIEKS [a 'Justice' Depart-
ment employee and Customs official who, Riconosciuto alleged, 
had intelligence ties] as to the possible consequences of his 
going public with certain information.
     "According to Riconosciuto, Videnieks was a frequent visitor 
to the Cabazon Indian reservation near Palm Springs and visited
with tribal manager, John P. Nichols.  Nichols was in essence
Riconosciuto's boss in a number of enterprises conducted on
reservation land and the PROMIS modification was just one of
these projects.  According to Riconosciuto, in an interview with
T.C. conducted from jail, the PROMIS software was modified 
to install a backdoor access for use by American intelligence
services.  The software was then sold to 88 different countries 
as a sort of 'trojan horse' package enabling 'us' to access their
intelligence systems.  According to Riconosciuto these countries
included Iraq and Libya.
     "Correspondence between Nichols and other companies, if
authentic, indicates that Riconosciuto's claims of his expertise
in the area of electronics and armaments appear to be true. 
Marshall Riconoscuito, Michael's father is a reputed former
business partner of Richard Nixon.
     "According to Riconosciuto, the fuzzy status of reservation
land as 'sovereign' allowed elements of the CIA and organized
crime to conduct business uniquely.
     "Among the projects worked on during this time were joint
projects with WACKENHUT, a company loaded with former CIA 
and NSA personnel and business ventures with the Saudi Arabian
royal family and other unusual projects.
     "A joint venture with Southern California Edison will soon be 
generating power for bio-mass drawn from local waste outlets. 
Biological warfare projects were investigated with Stormont labor-
atories looking into the creation of 'pathogenic viruses' and en-
hanced fuel-air explosive weapons were created and tested in 
league with Meridian Arms at the NEVADA TESTING RANGE 
which MATCHED the explosive power of nuclear devices.
     "These enhanced weapons gained their power from polarizing
the molecules in the gas cloud by modification of the electric field, 
a technology developed from exploring Thomas Townsend Brown's
suppressed work, a knowledge which Riconosciuto claims he
gained from working at LEAR (Corp.) in Reno, Nevada.
     "Riconosciuto is said to have worked on the enhanced fuel-air 
explosive weapons with Gerald Bull of Space Research Corpora-
tion.  Bull, now deceased, later became an arms advisor to Saddam 
Hussein.  It is said that HUSSEIN POSSESSES THE FAE TECHNO-
LOGY.
     "In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times of  London 
was shot and KILLED in Guatemala.  He had reportedly been trying 
to interview an American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time 
director of security for the Cabazon Indian Reservation secret projects.
     "In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was found 
DEAD, killed by a single bullet in his chest.  According to a former 
federal official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was found dead 
in the parking lot where he had been due to meet with a woman who 
had crucial evidence to share substantiating Riconosciuto's claims.
     "Both Eisman's and Ng's deaths were declared 'suicides' by
authorities.
     "Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader who was in vocal oppo-
sition to the developments on the reservation, was found SHOT TO
DEATH WITH TWO FRIENDS in 1981.  Their murder remains un-
solved.
     "The leader of the House, Thomas Foley, announced last month 
that a formal inquiry will be initiated into the Inslaw case.  FOLEY 
appointed Senator Terry Sanford as co-chairman of the joint congress-
ional panel.  Prior to his election, Senator Sanford was the attorney 
REPRESENTING EARL BRIAN in his 1985 takeover bid for United 
Press International and was instrumental in appointing Earl Brian, a 
medical doctor, to the board of Duke Medical School, of which Sanford 
is President.  (Putting an Earl Brian supporter in charge of a Congres-
sional investigation into Justice Department crimes is an act of STUPID-
ITY similar to the assigning of John F. Kennedy assassination collab-
orators and fascists to the 'Warren Commission'.  WAKE UP PEOPLE!  
Can't you see that these NAZIS are playing BOTH SIDES of the game?  
They may be evil, but they're not stupid... although those who allow 
them to get away with this mockery of justice ARE... - Wol.)
      "However, despite repeated requests from journalists to produce 
photographs showing Riconosciuto together with Brian, and requests 
to produce his passport showing his alleged trip to Iran, he has not 
yet done so.  Also Riconosciuto failed to be able to describe Peter 
Videnieks to CNN's Moneyline program, claiming a medical condition 
prevented him from remembering clearly.
     "This led one former intelligence operative to speculate that we 
may be witnessing a very sophisticated intelligence operation being 
played out in public.
     "Former F.B.I. Special Agent, Ted Gunderson, speaks for Ricono-
sciuto's credibility.  Gunderson, who lives in Manhattan Beach, has 
worked with Riconosciuto for many years in his capacity as private 
investigator.
     "Together, according to Gunderson, they were responsible for
thwarting a terrorist operation during the Los Angeles Olympics. 
According to Gunderson, Riconosciuto was well known in certain
circles as a genius in almost all sciences.
     "The so-called drug operation broken up in Washington State
was an electrohydrodynamic mining operation claimed Gunderson,
using Townsend Brown technology.  A videotape viewed by this
journalist revealed metallic powders and apparent processes un-
related to drug manufacture.  Indeed, a government analysis of soil 
samples revealed the absence of drug contamination, but a high 
concentration of barium.  Barium is often found in high voltage 
related work.
     "Unsubstantiated information from an intelligence source
claims that the current situation (with the scenario being carried
out around former Wackenhut/Nevada Test Site worker Michael 
Riconosciuto and others? - Wol.) is the visible effect OF A WAR 
CURRENTLY GOING ON IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
between a group centered in the CIA called AQUARIUS (around 
a powerful center KNOWN AS MJ-12) and a group known as COM-
12 (the "Committee of 12") centered around Naval Intelligence.  
COM-12 is reputedly trying to sustain a rear-guard action to sustain 
and preserve constitutional government and is deliberately LEAKING 
INFORMATION damaging to the former group."  

     In the same publication, same issue, there appeared a small
article just following the one quoted above.  Written by Thomas
Zed, the article, titled "WACKENHUT'S CONNECTION WITH THE 
BLACK PROJECT WORLD", stated:

     "The Wackenhut company has a very close connection to the
world of BLACK BUDGET PROJECTS.  Besides being connected 
with the Cabazon venture mentioned in this issue it is also respon-
sible, according to jailed computer consultant Michael Ricono-
sciuto, FOR THE SECRET PROJECTS BEING UNDERTAKEN IN
DULCE, NEW MEXICO where the JICARILLA INDIAN RESER-
VATION IS BEING SIMILARLY USED. (Note: The Underground 
Labs near Dulce are apparently run as a joint effort of the Department 
of Energy, Rand Corp, Los Alamos Labs, MJ-12, the CIA and other 
'secret government' controlled military-industrial organizations.  In
light of this fact, could the Cabazon reservation also hold an under-
ground base?  The 'secret government' according to many sources
is NOT the Constitutional government as we know it, and there has
been a great deal of internal conflict between the two 'governments',
not only in regards to COM-12 vs. MJ-12, but also as seen during
the internal conflicts which led up to the John F. Kennedy and Bobby
Kennedy assassinations.  JFK in early 1963, for instance, warned
MJ-12 member and CIA associate Gordon Gray that if 'they' did not 
clean up their CIA, cease their international drug operations, etc., 
he would "dismember" the agancy.  According to the motion picture 
"JFK", Kennedy DID in fact give an executive order that for all intents 
and purposes would have disbanded the Central Intelligence Agency, 
however the order was resisted and later that year -- Nov. 22, 1963 -- 
Kennedy was killed in Dallas, Texas.  Also, in regards to the under-
around bases, the AQUARIUS - CIA/NSA - MJ12 network are not the
only ones with access to underground facilities.  NAVY INTEL - COM-
12 and other "pro-Constitutional" Intelligence agencies who support
them are establishing their own underground bases, and Navy Intelli-
gence has developed its own sophisticated antigravity fleet to challenge 
who or whatever might attempt to resist the expression of 'Truth, Justice 
and the American Way' as envisioned by the founding fathers of the
American Constitution. - Wol.)
     "After sending two of my colleagues there recently AND RECEIV-
ING CONFIRMATION THAT THERE WAS A TOP SECRET MILITARY 
TYPE INSTALLATION I decided to call the newspaper office and make 
an educated bluff.
     "I identified myself as a freelance reporter from Los Angeles -- and 
told the newspaper that I was doing a story on the Cabazon reservation 
biological warfare projects that had been undertaken there on behalf 
of the CIA.  I told her that I had heard that there were similar things 
being done in Dulce and would like to know what was going on.
     "The official I spoke to BECAME FRIGHTENED and said, 'I can't 
talk to you about that!  It would be very unprofessional of me to talk to 
you about that.  You'll have to speak to the President of the tribe.'  She 
then hung up.
     "I have yet to call back and ask the President of the tribe, but will 
report on that in the next issue.
     "WACKENHUT is also responsible for security of a lot of UNDER-
GROUND FACILITIES in California and Nevada, including the notorious 
S-4 or Area 51 in Nevada where Townsend Brown flying disk technology 
(written about in a T.C. recent issue) has been flying and developing for 
decades.
     "A recent helicopter crash at the area, where two pilots and three 
security guards from Wackenhut flying in a Messerschmit BO-105 
helicopter were killed was not at all accidental claimed Riconosciuto, 
who said that the individuals aboard the helicopter were traveling with 
sensitive documents.
     "Groups are now investigating Riconosciuto's claims."

[MORE NOTES ON DULCE:
	During the mid-1980's, physicist and founder of THUNDER
SCIENTIFIC LABS {along with his three sons}, Paul Bennewitz began
testing sensitive electronic equipment in and around the desert mesas
surrounding Dulce, NM.  During the course of his research he began
detecting unusual activity taking place atop the barran Archuleta mesa 
NW of Dulce.  Some of this activity included evidence of antigravity 
[reputedly atomic powered] type aircraft; unusual government lab-vans; 
black automobiles; armed military personnel; military helicopters; and 
unusual digital transmissions.  Bennewitz succeeded in interpreting 
some of the transmissions and came to the conclusion that a top 
secret military-type base existed under the mesa.
	Although the CIA seemed to be involved, the activity at the
base had little to do with the constitutional government as we know it.
The reason for this was that within the base, according to Bennewitz,
intense Frankensteinian genetic engineering projects were underway, 
unregulated projects that would turn the stomach of the most liberal 
AMA regulator {although they probably would not twinge the non-
existent consciences of the 'mad doctors' who worked in Nazi concen-
tration camps, like those who LATER FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE 
CIA}, projects which required human subjects from various nationalities 
who would be abducted for the purpose.  Why not?  It happened before 
{in Nazi Germany}.  It is notable that the greatest concentration of the 
mysterious 'cattle mutilation' phonomena of the 1970's - 1980's had its 
EPICENTER on the 'Gomez' ranch just 13 miles from Dulce.  The Gomez 
family had lost over $100,000 worth of livestock to the nocturnal mutilators.
	Bennewitz took his findings to Kirtland Air Force Base officials,
and the Wing Commander himself became involved and arranged intelli-
gence briefings between Bennewitz and Air Force O.S.I. officials.  Kirtland 
AFB then contacted the White House to determine what course of action 
should be taken.  The White House staff, apparently having no 'direct' 
knowledge of the base, recommended an immediate investiation.  How-
ever, shortly after this something strange took place.  Intense pressure 
from 'somewhere' in the intelligence community began coming against 
Kirtland AFB to stop the investigation, and against Bennewitz himself.  
One individual who was used to bring pressure against Bennewitz was 
"Ufologist" William Moore, who is well known among Ufologists for his 
constant attempts to discredit reports of underground bases, cattle muti-
lations, and 'abductions'.  Moore actually admitted to some researchers 
that he was working for a secret CIA organization called the "Aviary", 
which operated as an extention of "MJ-12", and that they "may" have 
been using him to spread disinformation.  Through the interference of 
Moore and his "associates", Paul Bennewitz was discredited and forcibly
"committed" to a mental facility in Albuquerque and given "electroshock
therapy".  When he was release, Bennewitz stated that he had "no more
desire" to pursue his former course of investigation, and he became a
recluse... - Wol.]
