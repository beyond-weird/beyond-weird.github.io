     "One possible scenario is that John Lear found out about this Top
     Secret project -- perhaps while eavesdropping -- and this is his
     way of 'spilling the beans' without implicating his father or
     anyone else as the source."

In 1990, researcher Val Valerian released a peculiar document which was
sent to him by another researcher. The document is actually a list of
several military personnel. However, the strange thing about this document
was the title-heading.

Some researchers believe that within the deepest levels of the government
is an on-going 'covert space program' utilizing some very remarkable
aerospace and propulsion technologies. However, the very nature of this
program, the clandestine (and possibly illegal) means by which it is
funded, as well as the possible means by which they came across this
'technology', has apparently led the 'Secret' Government into keeping these
activities one of the world's top secrets, and apparently they have
enforced this cover-up, as John Lear says, with 'deadly force'. Perhaps one
of the most important reasons for the secrecy, according to some, is that
SOME groups within the secret government have allegedly -- in the face of
'superior alien technology' -- 'surrendered' to a malevolent alien race and
have become their 'agents' on earth.

Is it also possible -- as many researchers and prominent military,
government and industrial personnel are actually confirming -- that the
'secret government' is utilizing this advanced super-technology (which they
have hidden from the public) to carry out a clandestine space program
involving not only manned FLIGHTS to the moon, but also manned BASES on the
moon and, some claim, even Mars as well? There appears to be enough
mounting evidence to cause the public to at least consider the possibility
of these claims. Actually, if one carefully examines all of the various
claims and how they merge together in synchronicity, and if one studies the
various theories and arguments concerning Einstein's 'unified field' theory
and the apparent underlying connection between electromagnetism, gravity
waves, and other 'unified field' forces, such a scenario involving a fleet
of top secret government antigravity craft would not be outside the realm
of possibility.

The document referred to above contains in the title heading both the terms
'Starfleet International' and 'United Federated Planets'. Why would such a
statement appear on a MILITARY document? Could it be that, although perhaps
somewhat presumptuously, a secret group of 'astronauts' constantly travel
back and forth from ultra-secret bases on or below the earth, the moon, and
mars; and have in anticipation of an ever-growing interplanetary network
named this organization 'Starfleet International' and/or the 'United
Federated Planets'?

Val Valerian gives the following 'introduction' and story behind the
document:

"...Researcher George Andrews forwarded this puzzle to us. From the
introduction, it might seem that this thing was complete bunk. There it
might have stayed, except that WE TRACED 11 PEOPLE ON THE LIST TO ACTUALLY
BEING IN THE MILITARY. What does it mean?"

The following introduction is given by George Andrews:

     "A friend who wishes to remain anonymous, who lives in a large
     city, recently woke about 3 A.M. with a strong but apparently
     irrational impulse to get dressed and to go to an all- night
     photostat place. As she was entering, she noticed a man dressed
     in a Navy officers uniform who was just leaving, who threw some
     papers into the trash barrel near the door. She made her copies
     and was about to leave and had another impulse to retrieve what
     the Navy officer had thrown away. She came up with these pages.
     Under normal circumstances, the news that the United States Navy
     has a flying disk named the U.S.S. Excalibur (and U.S.S. Concord?
     - Branton), operated by a crew of four, would be cause for
     celebration... however (unless) this achievement is the result of
     the collaboration of the 'Greys'..."

Andrews goes on to suggest that they might, because of their collaboration
with the 'Greys', be forced to take part in offensive attacks against the
'Blonds', who have allegedly had ancient conflicts with the Greys.

The introduction goes on to state that those names which appear with an
(x), are people who have actually been traced to the military. Take special
note of names like Ferguson, Caskey, Taylor, Burrall, Stevens, and Miller
-- which are repeated more than once throughout the list. Possible signs of
Nepotism?

George Andrews suspects that 'Starfleet International' consists of
human-military personnel only, while the 'United Federated Planets' may
somehow tie-in with the non-human entities' such as the 'Serpent Race' or
the 'Greys'. However, Andrews' theory that THIS particular Governmental
establishment has collaborated with the Grays is yet to be confirmed.

There is a possibility that the UFP involves interaction with the
'Federated' human cultures in this small corner of the galaxy. Let us hope
that this is the case, IF the following information is true. There is
evidence in fact that certain 'Constituted Government' officials (who are
loyal to the American- Constitutional 'Republic') -- as confirmed by Guy
Kirkwood and others -- have secret 'alliances' with the 'Nordics'; wheres
the 'Secret Government' collaborators (who are loyal to the Bavarian- Roman
'Empire') tend to collaborate with the saurian Grays, etc. Below is a

PEA Research (105 Serra Way., Ste. 176., Milpitas, CA. 95035) made the
following comments in one of their 'Files' (which consist of collections of
large amounts of documents and research related to UFO's):

"...Ramifications of MJ-12.

"If the U.S.A.F. test-flew a disk and was successful, what's to prevent
them from using the same saucer to transport men and materials to the moon
and mars? They would also be in a position to exploit the archeological
artifacts of the pyramids and sphinx in the valley of Illysium on Mars.
Also they could recover artifacts of previous races on the surface of the
moon. With the aid of NASA satellites they could map and mine the rare
earth (Moon, Mars) minerals at the expense of the tax payers while at the
same time claim that we have nothing better in our technology than space
shuttles (rocket power).

"If the Canadian Geomagnetic project was successful with their free-energy
geomagnetic motor, then why haven't we seen free-energy engines for the
home and auto instead of hearing about oil shortages?

"If the President of the USA is allowed only certain appointed staff by the
Constitution and Congress - are the members of MJ-12 outside of the limits
of the Constitution or did Congress give the President the power to set up
a Secret Government (non-elected) without the public right to vote on this
choice of the governing of the various military and non-military branches
of the united states?

"When the MJ-12 use non-appropriated funds for their Secret operations are
they using money from the Black Budget? If so, when did we cast a vote
stating that ANY branch of the Government can use the taxpayers money
without giving an account or being held accountable for it?

"When MJ-12 refuse to grant FOIA requests because of National Security
reasons, is it because the USA won't be secure against foreign earthly
powers, alien powers or against the wrath of a misled and deceived United
States public (the Voters)?

"Can laws be passed to Guarantee that various branches of the Government
will be held accountable for (the) shredding of classified documents? How
about passing laws to guarantee stiff jail sentences for underlings
(secretaries, lower rank personnel) that carry out the command to shred
confidential files?

"If the top of the mountain is corrupt, what about the foundation that was
later raised under it. If a Secret Government is illegal, what about all of
the secret projects it started and maintains control of? It's one thing to
classify advances in technology as SECRET, but it's quite different to
classify non-elected government as SECRET. When that non-accountable
Government (non- accountable by reason of being SECRET) passes military
laws that affect all branches of Government (military and non-military) are
the laws legal or non Constitutional?

"If the JMP (Justice for Military Personnel) letter is true, are the
actions of the CIA legal as used AGAINST citizens of the USA? Isn't the
purpose of the CIA to protect citizens AGAINST foreign threats?

"If the MIBS exist according to the documents, what has happened to the
Conscience of the Military Personnel that carry out false ID missions
against private citizens? Why are Military Personnel carrying out higher up
orders to impersonate branches of Government they neither represent or have
Rank in? Is this patriotism or blindness?"

In the April, 1963 issue of SEARCH Magazine, Will Carson and Jeannie Joy,
in their regular column 'PRYING INTO THE UNKNOWN', related the following
incredible story, which involved an apparent encounter with an unknown race
below the MOJAVE Desert region:

"It has always been a mystery to us in the first place how Mr. and Mrs.
P.E. can find and afford the time to do the sort of things most of us only
dream of doing. After knowing them for more than fifteen years, it is
inconceivable to suspect their integrity or sanity - and yet they impose
the following excise upon our credulity...

"While exploring for petroglyphs in the Casa Diablo vicinity of BISHOP,
CALIFORNIA, Mr. & Mrs. P.E. came upon a circular hole in the ground, about
nine feet in diameter, which exuded a sulfurous steam and seemed recently
to have been filled with hot water. A few feet from the surface the shaft
took a tangent course which looked easily accessible and, upon an impulse
with which we cannot sympathize, the dauntless E.'s, armed only with a
flashlight, forthwith crawled down into that hole.

"At a depth we've failed to record the oblique tunnel opened into a
horizontal corridor whose dripping walls, now encrusted with minerals,
(and) could only have been carved by human hands, countless ages ago - of
this the E.'s felt certain. The end of the short passage was blocked by
what seemed to be a huge doorway of solid rock which, however, wouldn't
yield. The light of their flash was turned to a corner where water dripped
from a protuberance - which proved to be a delicately carved face,
distorted now by the crystallized minerals, and from whose gaping mouth
water issued.

"As Mr. and Mrs. E. stood there in silent awe - wondering what lay behind
that immovable door - the strangest thing of all happened...but our
chronology will not be incorrect if we wait till they return to the surface
before revealing this, for now the water began gushing from the carved
mouth and from other unseen ducts elsewhere in that cave and rising at an
alarming rate!

"They hurried to the surface, and in less than half an hour there was only
a quite ordinary appearing pool of warm mineral water on the desert floor.

"'Do you know,' Mrs. E. said to her husband, 'while I stood down there I
heard music - the strangest, most weird music I'd ever heard. But it seemed
to come from everywhere at once, or inside my own head. I guess it was just
my imagination.'

"Mr. E. turned pale. 'My God,' he said; 'I thought it was MY imagination,
but I heard it, too - like music from some other world!'

"Why do they call that rock formation near where the E's had their strange
experience Casa Diablo - the Devil's house? And why did the Indians name
that area Inyo - dwelling place of the great spirit?"

The following is a quote from Matt Spetalnick's article "IS ANYBODY OUT
THERE? NASA LOOKS FOR REAL ET'S", in REUTERS Magazine, Oct. 5, 1992:

"At least 70 times scientists have picked up radio waves that bore the
marks of communication by beings from other worlds, but they were never
verified, [Frank] Drake said."

Through proposed projects such as SETI [Search For Extraterrestrial
Intelligence], which involves large arrays of Radio Dish receiving
mechanisms to 'tune in' to cosmic radio waves, Drake and others hoped to
contact outside intelligences. However, if the incidents related by Forest
Crawford earlier in this File are correct, this has already occurred. If
our tax dollars are going toward other SETI type 'experiments', chances are
that the public will NOT and NEVER be officially told of the outcome, if
they [once again] receive signals from other nearby stars. Such a
disclosure might threaten the psychological "control" which the (secret)
government has imposed on the nations. THE SECRET GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WISH
TO ALLOW PLANET EARTH TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A BENEVOLENT FEDERATION OF
HUMAN WORLDS, as the Federation policies would certainly condemn the
horrendous power-games which the Illuminati has used for centuries to keep
mankind in its stranglehold of slavery. The Illuminati will only ally
themselves with aliens (such as the REPTILIAN/GRAYS and some branches of
the ASHTAR/ASTARTE network which has collaborated with the ILLUMINATI,
NAZIS and GRAYS in the past) that share their desire to wield absolute god-
like empirical control of the planet. It is very likely that Frank Drake
was somehow sold-out to the Bavarian-Roman-Gray (Illuminati "Serpent Cult")
Combine, when we consider his complicity with the Inter-national UFO
coverup.

Incidentally, another possible use of radar-dish antennas has been
suggested by K.S. of Salt Lake City, Utah, who allegedly talked to a man
who was involved in setting up top secret underwater radio dishes for
secret government projects. He claimed that many of these dishes were used
to communicate with "our" bases on the moon and mars. If this is the case
could the SETI program be, to some extent, an extension of this?

Death Valley, California and the Mojave Desert region, as we have indicated
earlier, has been the sight of numerous UFO sightings in the past. Some
regard it as no less that a doorway into another world.

The Paihute Indians as we have also related, tell of a race of Grecian or
Egyptian-like people with white robes, sandals, and long dark hair held
back with a band, who thousands of years ago arrived in North America in
large rowing-sailing vessels. The Paiutes say that when Death Valley was
still part of an inland sea connected to the Pacific ocean through the Gulf
of California, these "Havmu-suvs" discovered an underground cavern system
within the Panamint mountains adjacent to the west edge of Death Valley,
and within these vast caverns they built their civilization. To briefly
review the Paihute account:

The legend says that these ancient people landed their ships near or just
below large 'quays' or 'doors' high up the eastern slope of the Panamints.
However after centuries the lake eventually dried up and disappeared, and
as a result of this they developed new methods of reaching the world
beyond. This, the Paiutes say, was when they began to experiment with the
construction of silvery 'flying canoes'. Whether there is any connection
with the following account is uncertain, but in 1905 an 'airship flap' was
observed throughout southern California. On August 2, 1905, J. A. Jackson,
"a well-known resident of Silshee," was out at 1:30 in the morning when a
bright light appeared in the sky and headed for him. According to an
account published in the Brawley, California, NEWS on Aug. 4, 1905:

     "He watched it closely until behind the light there appeared the
     form of an airship, apparently about 70 feet in length, with a
     searchlight in front and several other lights aboard. The
     mysterious machine appeared to be propelled by wings alone and
     rose and fell as the wings flapped like a gigantic bird.
     Apparently there was no balloon attachment as is usually the case
     with airships.

     "Mr. Jackson, being close to the home of W.E. Wilsie, woke him up
     in time to see the lights of the machine before it
     disappeared.... The same night, H. E. Allatt, postmaster at
     Imperial, was awakened from sleep by a bright light shining into
     his room. There was no moon, the light was thought to be fire,
     and Mr. Allatt rose to investigate, but no fire was found.
     Looking at his watch, the time was discovered to be 1:30 o'clock
     (a.m.), and it is believed that the brilliant light was caused by
     the searchlight from this mysterious airship."

A craft of almost identical description was reported only 4 years later in
the Dec. 15, 1909 issue of the Arkansas GAZETTE:

     "A. W. Norris of Mabelvale, road overseer of District No. 8, is
     of the opinion that an airship passed over his residence at about
     10 o'clock Monday night (December 12). Mr. Norris states that he
     was standing in his doorway when a strange light appeared,
     apparently about 300 feet above him, traveling south at a rapid
     rate of speed and disappeared a moment or two later in the
     darkness. He said that the light had the appearance of a
     searchlight similar to those used on automobiles, and IT ROSE AND
     FELL like a bird in flight. The night was cloudy, which precludes
     the possibility of the light having been a star or any
     atmospheric phenomena."

Air ships of this description were apparently common following the turn of
the century, but few if any of this particular type of craft have been
reported after the period just described (1900-1910, etc.). Just because an
'airship' appears over California or Arkansas does not necessarily indicate
that the airship was native to either one of those areas. However, there
are nonetheless many evidences, as indicated elsewhere in this File, that
the Mojave Desert--Panamint Mountains -- Death Valley areas were apparently
(in ancient times) a 'cradle', possibly one of many, for an early
civilization which later developed an advanced form of technology; and
having done so in relative secrecy, they were unhindered by the
'uncivilized' tribes outside of their domain who continued in their
relatively ignorant lifestyles.

Perhaps the most remarkable confirmation of this appears in Bourke Lee's
biography 'DEATH VALLEY MEN' [MacMillan Co., New York. 1932], which also
dealt with alleged caverns WITHIN the Panamint Mts. region. If indeed the
Panamint mountains are an ancient 'doorway' to an advanced and hidden HUMAN
civilization, then one must recognize that it--as well as any of it's
'NATIONAL TREASURES'--should be (as should be ANY NATIONAL BORDER ON THE
FACE OF THE EARTH) considered the legal territory of those who have
possessed it since ancient times. "Borders" need not be entirely
horizontal, but they can be vertical as well. Un- welcome intrusions into
such an 'undiscovered country' might be dealt with as in ANY OTHER nation
on earth, and one should approach such territories with caution. UNLIKE
other areas where subterraneous and malevolent anti-human or 'reptilian'
activity is alleged to exist, the independence and national sovereignty of
those subsurface regions where hidden HUMAN colonies reside should be
honored as one would honor ANY national border on the face of the earth.

Even if an archeological discovery is found which belonged to the ancestors
of an ancient culture which STILL EXISTS, that discovery should be the
property of that culture alone. One of the arguments FOR making public
sensitive information on various exterran and subterran cultures would be
to protect those HUMAN cultures from the secret governments machinations,
by bringing international public support in favor of that hidden culture
and its right to maintain their sovereignty and independence (if the secret
government knowingly violates another "countries" rights, every other
independent country in the world would feel threatened as well). And in the
case of the various hidden underground centers utilized by the reptilian
grays, the public knowledge of this would be necessary to maintain the
"national security" of each independent nation which might otherwise be
"infiltrated" via implantation, or other forms of mind control (which
inevitably leads to other forms of control -- political, spiritual,
educational, economical, etc.). Even IF various subsurface human cultures
were driven out of their underground homes by non-human malevolents, AND if
those territories are somehow regained in a possible future
counter-invasion against the reptilian incursions, then those territories
should STILL rightfully and legally belong to or returned to the human
cultures who formerly possessed them.

Supposing there IS a counter-invasion in the future, there would no doubt
still be much territory left over once the reptilians are driven out and/or
destroyed, territory which might NOT be 'claimed' by a cave-dwelling tribe,
colony or culture. Such underground systems could then be claimed by an
outside government if they felt the need to expand their own 'territory'.
According to some accounts, the U.S. government does know about many such
underground systems and having found many of them unoccupied in past
explorations, have claimed them for their own.

Unfortunately, even in the case of smaller underground repositories of
ancient artifacts, there are indications that many ancient treasures have
been 'melted down' by prospectors, tomb robbers, etc., in order to gain the
metal value of the gold, silver and other precious metals, out of which the
ancient artifacts were formed, in order to PREVENT the state from taking
'their find' away. In doing so, such plunderers have destroyed the immense
historical and archaeological value of such treasures in exchange for the
'relatively' pitiful metallic value. Many of the ancient Egyptian treasures
fell prey to such vandals and 'grave robbers' in ancient times. Even if one
does not agree with the religious symbolism's behind such artifacts, their
historical and archeo- logical value makes them nevertheless worthy of
preservation. The only reason that 'King Tut's' treasures have made such an
impact (even though he was a minor 'king'), is that these treasures were
among the VERY FEW which were not discovered by grave robbers and melted
down for their metal content.

There is no telling how much HISTORICAL INFORMATION about ancient cultures
has been forever lost by such careless actions. Hopefully humankind has
reached the point of maturity where the discovery of such treasures in the
future will result in a cooperative scientific study of the ancient
artifacts for the benefit of all, rather than the violence, death and
betrayal which has often resulted in the past through the mistakes of
selfish treasure hunters fighting each other for the 'booty'. According to
some accounts many of these ancient sites still await discovery, finds
which may make King Tut's Tomb look insignificant by comparison.

As we have implied, just as one should honor the ancient archaeological
SITES of existing cultures, in the same way one should honor the national
sovereignty of another human CULTURE itself. To fail to do so would be in
essence to THROW AWAY any 'legal' argument a nation might have FOR the
protection of their own national sovereignty (CASE IN POINT: the reptilian
or 'Draconian' Empire with it's major earth-center in the "Bhoga-vita"
complex below India, and the human 'Illuminati' empires on and beyond earth
-- which apparently have a secret alliance with each other -- have so
interfered in the sovereignty of nearly EVERY nation on earth, and have
done so to the point that they can no longer legally claim any rational
defense against ANY nation which would decide to abuse THEIR 'sovereignty'.
The Reptilian empire is of course a problem in itself, having been at war
(via overt attacks or covert manipulation - against the majority of
humanity in, on, and above earth) since ancient times and apparently, from
the accounts given throughout this and other files, does not even
acknowledge humankind's right to this planet, nor even their 'right' to
exist).

Paihute Indian legends say that the 'People of the Panamints' long ago left
their ancient city within the mountains of California and moved most of
their civilization into still deeper cavern levels, AND (according to still
other accounts) to colonies beyond the confines of planet earth itself.
Although these 'Havmusuvs' may be 'benevolent' in comparison to some
cultures inhabiting the surface of the planet, they nevertheless --
according to the documentation in this and other databases -- have the
ability and technology to defend their 'borders' and their loved ones from
any potential enemy..

In his chapter 'OLD GOLD' the author of 'DEATH VALLEY MEN', Bourke Lee,
relates the allegedly-true account of two prospectors who claimed to have
discovered this ancient, abandoned 'city' within huge caverns inside the
heart of the Panamint mountains. Take special note of the INCREDIBLE
similarity between this account and the one given to the Navajo Oga-Make by
an old Paihute sage, as recorded in the article 'TRIBAL MEMORIES OF THE
FLYING SAUCERS'. We will take up the story where two Death Valley residents
by the name of Bill and Jack are having a conversation with two
prospectors, 'Thomason' and 'White', from whom the author 'apparently'
learned the details of the following discussion, if not present at the
discussion himself:

...Thomason looked from Jack to Bill and asked, 'How long have you men been
in this country?'

Jack spoke before Bill had a chance. 'Not very long,' said Jack quietly.
Bill glanced curiously at Jack but said nothing. If Jack thought that 30
years was not very long, that was all right with Bill.

Thomason said, 'I've been in and out of the Death Valley country for 20
years. So has my partner. We know where there is lost treasure. We've known
about it for several years, and we're the only men in the world [?] who do
know about it. We're going to let you two fellows in on it. You've been
good to us. You're both fine fellows. You haven't asked us any questions
about ourselves, and we like you. We think you can keep a secret, so we'll
tell you ours."

Jack blew smoke and asked, "A lost mine?"

"No, not a mine," said Thomason. "A lost treasure house. A lost city of
gold. It's bigger than any mine that ever was found, or ever will be."

"It's bigger than the United States Mint," said White, with his voice and
body shaking with excitement. "It's a city thousands of years old and worth
billions of dollars! Billions of Dollars! Billions! Not Millions.
Billions!"

Thomason and White spoke rapidly and tensely, interrupting each other in
eager speech.

Thomason said, "We've been trying to get the treasure out of this golden
city for years. We had to have help, and we haven't been able to get it."

"Everybody tries to rob us," put in White. "They all want too big a share.
I offered the whole city to the Smithsonian Institution for five million
dollars -- only a small part of what it's worth. They tried to rob us, too!
They said they'd give me a million and a half for a discovery that's worth
a billion dollars!" he sneered. "I had nothing more to do with them."

Jack got up and found his plug of tobacco. He threw away his cigarette and
savagely bit off an enormous chew. He sat down and crossed his legs and
glowered at White as he worked his chew into his jaw.

Bill's voice was meek as he asked, "And this place is in Death Valley?"

"Right in the Panamint Mountains!" said Thomason. "My partner found it by
accident. He was prospecting down on the lower edge of the range near
Wingate Pass. He was working in the bottom of an old abandoned shaft when
the bottom fell out and landed him in a tunnel. We've explored the tunnel
since. It's a natural tunnel like a big cave. It's over 20 miles long. It
leads all through a great underground city; through the treasure vaults,
the royal palace and the council chambers; and it connects to a series of
beautiful galleries with stone arches in the east slope of the Panamint
Mountains. Those arches are like great big windows in the side of the
mountain and they look down on Death Valley. They're high above the valley
now, but we believe that those entrances in the mountain side were used by
the ancient people that built the city. They used to land their boats
there."

"Boats!" demanded the astonished Bill, "boats in Death Valley?"

Jack choked and said, "Sure, boats. There used to be a lake in Death
Valley. I hear the fishing was fine."

"You know about the lake," Thomason pointed his blue chin at Jack. "Your
geology would tell you about the lake. It was a long time ago... The
ancient people who built the city in the caverns under the mountain lived
on in their treasure houses long after the lake in the valley dried up. How
long, we don't know. But the people we found in the caverns have been dead
for thousands of years. Why! Those mummies alone are worth a million
dollars!"

White, his eyes blazing, his body trembling, filled the little house with a
vibrant voice on the edge of hysteria. "Gold!" he cried. "Gold spears! Gold
shields! Gold statues! Jewelry! Thick gold bands on their arms! I found
them! I fell into the underground city. There was an enormous room; big as
this canyon. A hundred men were in it. Some were sitting around a polished
table that was inlaid with gold and precious stones. Men stood around the
walls of the room carrying shields and spears of solid gold. All the men --
more than a hundred -- had on leather aprons, the finest kind of leather,
soft and full of gold ornaments and jewels. They sat there and stood there
with all that wealth around them. They are still there. They are all dead!
And the gold, all that gold, and all those gems and jewels are all around
them. All that gold and jewelry! Billions!" White's voice was ascending to
a shriek when Thomason put a hand on his arm and White fell silent, his
eyes darting about to the faces of those who sat around the table.

Thomason explained quietly, "These ancient people must have been having a
meeting of their rulers in the council chamber when they were killed very
suddenly. We haven't examined them closely because it was the treasure that
interested us, but the people all seem to be perfect mummies."

Bill squinted at White and asked, "Ain't it dark in this tunnel?"

"Black dark," said White, who had his voice under control again. His
outburst had quieted him. "When I first went into that council room I had
just some candles. I fumbled around. I didn't discover everything all at
once like I'm telling you. I fell around over these men, and I was pretty
near almost scared out of my head. But I got over that and everything was
all right and I could see everything after I hit the lights."

"Lights? There were lights?" It was Bill asking.

"Oh, yes," said White. "These old people had a natural gas they used for
lighting and cooking. I found it by accident. I was bumping around in the
dark. Everything was hard and cold and I kept thinking I was seeing people
and I was pretty scared. I stumbled over something on the floor and fell
down. Before I could get up there was a little explosion and gas flames all
around the room lighted up. What I fell over was a rock lever that turned
on the gas, and my candle set the gas off. That was when I saw all the men,
and the polished table, and the big statue. I thought I was dreaming. The
statue was solid gold. It's face looked like the man sitting at the head of
the table, only, of course, the statue's face was much bigger than the
man's, because the statue was all in perfect size, only bigger. The statue
was solid gold, and it is 89 feet, six inches tall!"

"Did you measure it," asked Jack, silkily, "or just guess at it?"

"I measured it. Now you'll get an idea of how big that one room -- the
council room -- is. That statue only takes up a small part of it!"

Steady and evenly, Jack asked, "Did you weigh the statue?"

"No," said White. "You couldn't weigh it."

Bill was puzzled. "Would you mind telling me how you measured it?" asked
Bill.

"With a sextant," said White. "I always carry a sextant when I'm on the
desert. Then if I get lost, I can use my sextant on the sun or moon or
stars to find myself on the map. I took a sextant angle of the height of
the statue and figured it out later."

"A sextant," said Bill, frowning heavily.

Jack said, "It's a part of the church, Bill. Never mind that.... Tell us
some more about this place. It's very interesting."

Fred Thomason said, "Tell them about the treasure rooms."

"I found them later." White polished his shining pate with a grimy
handkerchief. "After I got the lights going I could see all the walls of
this big room and I saw some doors cut in the solid rock of the walls. The
doors are big as slabs of rock hung on hinges you can't see. A big rock bar
lets down across them. I tried to lift up the bars and couldn't move them.
I fooled around trying to get the doors open. I must have been an hour
before I took ahold of a little latch like on the short end of the bar and
the great bar swung up. Those people know about counter-weights and all
those great big doors with their barlocks -- they must weigh hundreds of
tons -- are all balanced so that you can move them with your little finger,
if you find the right place."

Thomason again said, "Tell them about the treasure."

"It's gold bars and precious stones. The treasure rooms are inside these
big rock doors. The gold is stacked in small bars piled against the walls
like bricks. The jewels are in bins cut out of rock. There's so much gold
and jewelry in that place that the people there had stone wheelbarrows to
move the treasure around."

Jack sat up in sudden interest. "Wheelbarrows?" he asked...

"We don't know how old they are," said Thomason, "but the stone
wheelbarrows are there."

"Stone wheelbarrows," marveled Jack. "Those dead men must have been very
powerful men. Only very strong men could push around a stone wheelbarrow
loaded with gold bars. The wheelbarrows must have weighed a tone without a
load in them."

"Yes," said Thomason, slowly, "the wheelbarrows are stone and of course
they are very heavy--"

"But they're very easy to push around even with a load in them," White
explained. "They're scientific wheelbarrows."

"No," objected Jack in a low tone of anguish.

"Yes," insisted White, pleasantly sure of himself. A small boy could fill
one of those stone wheelbarrows full of gold bars and wheel it around. The
wheelbarrows are balanced just like the doors. Instead of having the wheel
out in front so that a man has to pick up all the weight with his back,
these wise people put the wheel almost in the middle and arranged the
leverage of the shafts so that a child could put in a balanced load and
wheel the barrow around."

Jack's heart was breaking. He left the table and threw his chew out the
door. He went over to the stove with his cup. "Anybody want more coffee?"
he asked. No one did.

Bill studied Thomason and White for several minutes. Then he asked, "How
many times have you been in this tunnel?"

"I've been there three times," said White. "That's counting the first time
I fell in. Fred's been in twice; and my wife went part way in the last time
we was in."

Mrs. White stroked her blond hair and said, "I thought my husband was
romancing when he came home and told me what he found in the mountains. He
always was a romancer. I was sure he was just romancing about this city he
said he found. I didn't believe it until they took me into it. It is a
little hard to believe, don't you think?"

Bill said, "It sure is." Jack stirred sugar into his coffee and sat down at
the table again. Bill asked, "Did you ever bring anything out of the cave?"

"Twice," said Fred Thomason. "Both times we went in we filled out pockets
with gems, and carried out a gold bar apiece. The first time we left the
stuff with a friend of ours and we went to try and interest someone in what
we'd found. We thought the scientists would be interested or the
government. One government man said he'd like to see the stuff and we went
back to our friend to get the gold and jewels and he told us he'd never
seen them; and dared us to try to get them back. You see, he double crossed
us. We were in a little trouble at the time and the loss of that stuff just
put us in deeper. We couldn't get a stake because we were having hard work
making anyone believe us. So we made another trip out here for more proof.
That time we brought out more treasure and buried it close to the shaft
entrance to the underground city before we went back to the Coast. I
persuaded some university officials and some experts from the Southwest
Museum to come out here with me. We got up on the Panamints and I could not
find the shaft. A cloud-burst had changed all the country around the shaft.
We were out of luck. The scientists became unreasonably angry with us.
They've done everything they can to discredit us ever since."

Jack watched Thomason and White across the rim of his coffee cup. Bill
said, "And now you can't get into your treasure tunnel. It's lost again.
That's sure too bad."

Thomason and White smiled. "We can get in all right," said Thomason in a
genial voice his cold eyes did not support. Mrs. White smiled confidently
and her husband bobbed his head. Thomason went on: "You've forgotten about
the old boat landings on the Death Valley side of the Panamint Mountains.
All we have to do is climb the mountain to the openings where the galleries
come out of the city on the old lake shore. Do you know the mountains along
the west side of Death Valley?"

"I've been down there," said Bill.

Thomason turned to White: "How high do you think those galleries are above
the bottom of Death Valley?"

White said, "Somewhere around forty-five hundred or five thousand feet. You
looked out of them; what do you think?"

"That's about right," agreed Thomason. "The openings are right across from
Furnace Creek Ranch. We could see the green of the ranch right below us and
Furnace Creek Wash across the valley. We'll find those windows in the
mountains, all right."

"You goin down there now?" asked Bill.

"That's it," said White. "We're through with the scientists. We tried to
make a present of our discovery to science because we thought they would be
interested. But they tried to rob us, and then they laughed at us and
abused us..."

Saying thanks and farewell the treasure hunters left, promising to return,
and drove in their car down to Emigrant Canyon towards Death Valley. Later
that same afternoon Bourke Lee, the author of DEATH VALLEY MEN, allegedly
met the three of them on the floor of the valley. Their car was parked
beside the road between Furnace Creek Ranch and the Salt Beds. The men were
patching a tube. They did not need any help, so he wished them well and
said goodbye and went on towards the southern part of the barren valley. He
never saw Fred Thomason, Mr. White nor his wife again, and ten days later
when he again visited Bill Cocoran and Jack Stewart they told him that they
hadn't seen them since either. When another week went by and the
proprietors of the 'lost city' did not appear, the author and Bill made a
trip down into Death Valley in their car and took along a pair of field
glasses, hoping to see some sign of the explorers or of the 'windows' or
'quays' allegedly hid among the shadows of the eastern slope of the sun-
blistered Panamints. They failed to find any sign of either.

As we have indicated, there are many who suggest that Nevada rather than
New Mexico may be the 'center' of subsurface 'alien' activity in America.
This may be true in the sense that the major 'conflict' or 'interaction'
zone between Evadamic (Govt.- Nordic) and Draconian (Gray-Reptilian) forces
seems to exist below the Great Western Deserts of southern California,
Nevada and western Utah. The military installations in this region are
also, according to many sources, heavily involved in the alien scenario,
for either good or evil.

Whereas the 'front lines' so-to-speak may exist below the 'test' ranges of
Nevada and adjacent states, the 'center' of reptilian activity itself seems
to be Mt. Archuleta, N.M. and the 'Four Corners' region.

The American Center of the various subsurface human cultures seems to be
the Cascade-Sierra Nevada ranges (especially between Mt. Shasta and the
Panamints) even though some suggest that, at least in the past -- as in the
case of the U.S. Govt. itself -- 'some' of the human groups below the
California region made the tragic mistake of opting for a policy of
'appeasement' rather than 'retribution' in dealing with the serpent race.
This does not necessarily mean that this policy continues widespread today,
although the Mt. Lassen region is reportedly a strong center of current
'collaboration' between exterran/subterran reptilian grays AND above
ground/subterranean branches of the human Illuminati.

The following account which appeared in the Winter '92 issue of 'FAR OUT'
Magazine, in an article by H. Leo O'Neal titled 'THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH
VALLEY MUMMIES', was apparently an attempt to classify the following tale
as 'fantasy' even though the author of the article does admit that SEVERAL
people (witnesses) have reportedly been in these ancient chambers below the
Mojave, mentioned in the story.

These (more) recent events surrounding the Death Valley catacombs,
mentioned in the article, are as follows. We ask the readers simply to make
their own determination as to the authenticity of the account based on
other similar reports which we have related earlier.

In 1946, Dr. F. Bruce Russell, a retired Beverly Hills physician, struck of
a conversation with a Mr. Howard E. Hill in the city of Los Angeles.
Russell informed Hill that in 1931, while sinking a shaft in a claimsite of
his in Death Valley, he broke through to an underground cavern. After
finding some lights he entered and found himself in a cavern with two
passages, one heading 'left' and the other 'right'. Exploring the left-hand
passage he came to a cave-in, some 25 yards from the entrance shaft. The
right-hand path however continued at a steep angle downward for about a
quarter of a mile. Although some of the passages seemed natural, others
appeared to have been expanded by artificial means, but all of these went
off in several directions. One tunnel eventually led to a large room, and
this room also had branch tunnels leading off in all directions. Laid out
in this chamber were 3 'mummies' and several strange artifacts, some of
which appeared 'Egyptian' while others were more 'American Indian' like in
construction. The strange and shocking thing about the mummies however,
according to Russell, was that many of them were nearly 8 foot long or
tall! He described the underground system as a kind of 'underground city'.

The inhabitants must have been very advanced, Russell concluded from what
he observed, and he was certain that the find was much more important than
the famous King Tut's Tomb itself. Following the passages he eventually
discovered other openings to the surface, but most of these were in obscure
places, yet all that he explored were within 7 miles of the 'shaft' through
which he had first entered the underground complex.

Eventually, Russell discovered 32 caves in all throughout the area.
Although he could not prove it, since many of them had collapsed, he
supposed that many of them might have at one time connected with the
underground system. These 32 caves were all within 180 SQUARE miles of each
other, and were located in Death Valley and the extreme southwest region of
Nevada.

He also stumbled across a large chamber which he referred to as the 'ritual
hall', and which contained strange markings and symbols. Another tunnel,
according to Russell, went from this room to another underground hall where
well-preserved bones of dinosaurs, sabre-toothed tigers, mastodons and
other extinct animals were displayed in hollowed areas along the walls.

In 1946, after years of private investigation and secrecy, Russell decided
to exploit the find. After gathering a group of potential investors he held
a meeting in which he displayed some of the artifacts which he had taken
out of the underground system. Mr. Hill was invited to the meeting provided
that he could help out as an investor. He accepted the invitation and
attended the meeting. The company was called 'Amazing Explorations', and
the 'Investors' meeting took place at a suite in Beverly Hills, although
all of the investors were sworn to absolute secrecy. Hill and the rest of
the investors were taken, after this meeting concluded, to the underground
complex itself, to where Russell returned the artifacts which he had
displayed to the investors as he was convinced that the protected
atmosphere of the caves would preserve them. The group was taken into the
cavern in which the 'bones' and the 'temple' were located. According to
witnesses, it was "chock full of bizarre artifacts of all kinds." Russell
told them that they could look but not touch, as he realized the necessity
of preserving such a find in its original condition, both for
archaeological as well as monetary reasons.

On August 4, 1947, Howard Hill, acting as spokesman for 'Amazing
Explorations', issued a brief statement to the press announcing the
discovery. The story received minimal coverage, to his surprise, and only
appeared in a few newspapers in which the story was 'balanced' with very
derogatory and skeptical statements from the 'scientific' community.

After this, a live press conference was planned, in which Russell planned
to display a skeleton and/or several artifacts which would "convince even
the most skeptical reporter." And from that they could discover for
themselves the reliability of the find. For this, Russell had to return
once again to the caves to retrieve the necessary artifacts. He also
planned before leaving or shortly after his return to open a bank account
at Barstow bank to deposit investment capital. Russell left for Death
Valley but was never seen again. His CAR was later discovered with a busted
radiator in a seldom travelled part of Death Valley. Although some suspect
that he left with the money of the investors, this is unlikely since the
investors' money which he possessed at the time was not nearly enough to
warrent his disappearance, or the discontinuance of plans to commercialize
the site as one of the wonders of the world, and the potential wealth that
this might bring.

The investors attempted to re-locate the underground chambers that Russell
had shown them, but claimed that they could not remember the exact route
since they did not pay much attention to landmarks on the first trip, and
besides this, the shifting sunlight and shadows and the uniformity of the
vast landscape made that difficult. So ended the brief but interesting
events surrounding what might have turned out to be one of the most popular
wonders of the world, a 'potential' Federally-protected museum invaluable
to archeologist, anthropologist and historian alike, as well as millions of
potential tourists. In spite of the corroborating "circumstantial" evidence
for the existence of these ancient ruins, this "world" (or perhaps its
present for former inhabitants?) seems to continually resist all efforts of
us "outsiders" to probe its secrets in any dramatic way, at least (perhaps)
until its "protectors" feel that we are ready to discover these historical
treasures. Perhaps the "greed" that such treasures often arouse in human
hearts is in itself the very force that prevents their acquisition. Perhaps
when we set our hearts to search for Truth -- not for our own personal
greed or profit, but for the benefit of all humanity -- perhaps only then
will the TRUTH make itself available to those who are "ready" to recieve
it.

The following letter was sent to researcher Tim Beckley, and confirms much
of the information which has been 'surfacing' in recent years:

     "...I enjoy your magazine very much. Thank you for such a fine
     publication. I have seen UFOs, and it seems after you have seen
     one you're never the same. I separated from the U.S. Air Force in
     December of 1987. In the Air Force I was a 'Security Specialist.'
     It was my duty to safeguard Top Secret aircraft, weapons and
     equipment. I also guarded nuclear warheads. I was stationed at
     David-Monthan A.F.B. in Tucson, Arizona. In January of 1987 I was
     training in the desert for a Desert Survival Course. This area is
     between Indian Springs, Nevada and Las Vegas, Nevada. It is known
     as Silver Flag Alpha. There is a huge mountain range and on the
     other side of this range lies the 'Area 52', also known as
     'Dreamland.'

     "I asked an instructor what would happen if somebody went over
     the ridge. he said, 'No one can make it over that ridge,' and
     then gave me a foxish grin. One night about 0300 hours I was
     sitting in my foxhole gazing at the stars when a white light rose
     over the ridge. It performed two vertical loops then shot up into
     the sky at a speed you would not believe. Also it didn't make any
     noise.

     "After separating from the Air Force I stayed in Tucson for 19
     months. During this time my best Air Force buddy received orders
     for 'Area 52.' I told him to stay in touch. He called one day and
     told me he DIDN'T LIKE the assignment. I asked him about 'Area
     52' and he said he wasn't at liberty to discuss it. He did say he
     was stationed at Nellis A.F.B. Nevada and forced to live off
     base. He said an Air Force vehicle would pick him up and transfer
     him to 'Area 52' where he would spend 48 hours in an underground
     complex. After 48 hours he was then returned to his apartment for
     48 hours off time. I asked him what kind of things he had seen.
     He only said don't be surprised if one day we are living in
     space. After this we talked about normal guy stuff. I never have
     heard from him since, which is PECULIAR. I wonder if the Air
     Force had his apartment phone tapped? - Steve Blankenship -

The January, 1957 issue of FATE magazine, p. 10, carried an account of the
following strange discovery:

     "Dear Douglas, Ga., in Coffee County, workmen of the Head Well
     and Pump Company were drilling a 145-foot deep hole on the
     property of Mr. and Mrs. Earl Meeks, seven miles from Douglas.
     They stopped drilling when an unusual noise began to come out of
     the hole.

     "It was a roaring sound, SOMETHING LIKE AN UNDER- GROUND RAILWAY.
     As soon as they heard it, the drillers stopped. Driller Scott
     Dinking said he never heard anything like it before -- not in 27
     years in the business.

     "Joe Sports of the Associated Press went out to look at the hole.
     He found it was making so much noise that the Meeks had covered
     it partially by a plank because it kept them awake as night.

     "Sports noticed that AIR WAS BEING PULLED INTO THE HOLE BY A KIND
     OF SUCTION. He lighted a match atop the hole -- the smoke was
     drown downward. Sports borrowed a mirror and reflected light so
     he could see the bottom. He saw water down there. It all 'looked'
     quite and peaceful."

The following passages are quoted from the Greek philosopher Seneca's
classic ten-volume NATURALES QUAESTIONES (QUESTIONS OF NATURE), Vol. II,
pp. 99-105, 151-157 (English translation by Thomas H. Cocoran, PH.D.,
Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., & William Heinmann Ltd.,
London. 1972). Seneca begins by postulating that:

     "...rivers are no less existent under the earth merely because
     they are not seen. You must understand that down there rivers as
     large as our own glide along, some flowing gently, others
     resounding in their tumbling over the broken ground. What then?
     Will you not equally allow that there are some lakes underground
     and some waters stagnating there without exit?

     "...Throughout the entire earth, one of them says, runs many
     different kinds of water. In some places there are perpetual
     rivers large enough to be navigable, even without the help of
     rains.

     "...Moving air in the lower region inside the earth bursts the
     atmosphere, which is thick and complete with clouds, with the
     same force that clouds in our part of the world are usually
     broken open.

     "...Now permit me to tell you a story. Asclepiodotus is my
     authority that many men were sent down by Philip (i.e. Philip II
     of Macedon, 382-336 B.C., the father of Alexander the Great who
     according to Diodorus opened several new mines - ed) into an old
     mine, long since abandoned, to find out what riches it might
     have, what its condition was, whether ancient avarice had left
     anything for future generations. They descended with a large
     supply of torches, enough to last many days. After a while, when
     they were exhausted by the long journey, they (after breaking
     into vast cavities - ed) saw a sight that made them shudder: huge
     rivers and vast reservoirs of motionless water, equal to ours
     above ground and yet not pressed down by the earth stretching
     above, but with a vast free space overhead.

     "I read this story with great enjoyment. For I realized that our
     age suffers not from new vices but from vices that have been
     handed down all the way from antiquity, and it is not our age
     that avarice first pried into the veins of earth and rock
     searching for treasure poorly hidden in the darkness.

     "...Even before King Philip of Macedon there were men who
     followed after money down into the deepest hiding-places and, of
     upright and freeborn spirit as they were, let themselves down
     into those caverns where no difference between night and day
     reaches.

     "...What powerful necessity bent men down, man ordinarily erect
     to the stars, and buried him to the bottom of the innermost earth
     so that he might dig out gold, no less dangerous to search for
     than it is to possess? On account of this he dug shafts and
     crawled around the mud-smeared, uncertain booty, forgetful of
     day, forgetful of the better nature of things from which he had
     turned himself away.

     "...They dared to descend to a place where they found a strange
     order of things, layers of earth hanging overhead, dead winds in
     the darkness, dreadful springs of water flowing for no man, and a
     night other than our own, and perpetual. Then, after doing these
     things, they fear the Underworld!"

The following appears on p. 169 of Daniel Cohen's book 'THE ANCIENT
VISITORS' (Doubleday & Co., N.Y. 1976):

     "...For centuries hell was a very real and tangible place found
     somewhere underground. The 'entrance to hell' has been located
     countless times. Usually it was found in the country of one's
     enemy.

     "There were serious and scholarly speculations about huge
     underground caves. One seventeenth-century scholar said that
     dragons lived in underground caves, and that is why we saw so few
     of them. Siberian tribesmen who found the frozen remains of
     woolly mammoths, assumed that they were the remains of creatures
     that lived in a subterranean world. The Siberians could not
     conceive of extinct animals that had lived thousands of years
     ago, but vast underground worlds came quite naturally to them.
     According to legend, dwarfs lived in underground caves, and most
     accounts placed the realm of fairies under the earth as well."

In reference to the 'caverns of hell' or 'hades', this belief pre- dates
Christianity itself and can be traced back to ancient Greece. The Greeks
spoke of 'Hades' as a vast series of deep caverns, some containing frozen
conditions while others filled with smoking flames. The real tormentors of
hades however were the fallen angels of ancient tradition, who are said to
torment all souls that enter here. Also traditionally, over the entrance to
Hades can be read the words "ABANDON ALL HOPE, ALL YE WHO ENTER HERE".
Hades is said to be the center of the Satanic Kingdom established by the
fallen archangel Lucifer after his failed coup de'etat against the throne
of the Creator. It is said to contain vast fortresses created by his
infernal followers over the eons, possibly created of insubstantial or
etheric 'matter'.

As one descends through the caverns of Hades, according to Greek tradition,
things only become worse, until at last one reaches the realm of 'Tartarus'
itself. Tartarus, according to the Greeks, is "as far below Hades as Hades
is beneath the earth". It is a great "chasm" in the extreme depths that is
diffused throughout the entire earth. The Christian Bible refers to
Tartarus as the 'Bottomless Pit'. 'Bottomless' might indicate an absence of
gravity and a sense of eternal 'falling' for those unfortunate enough to
enter therein. Apparently physical life could not possibly exist there
because of the suffocating heat and darkness, and the lack of oxygen which
must instantly be consumed by the volcanic flames of terrifying realm. The
Bible also adds that there is a third level to 'Hell' called Gehenna, or a
'lake' of boiling magma or fire... a place almost too horrifying to
imagine.

This certainly does not conflict with present geological theory concerning
the interior of the earth, which is said to increase in temperature as one
passes the crust, the moho, the upper and lower mantle and finally the
outer and inner molten core. However there is another 'theory' as to the
configuration of the center of the earth, one which is steadily growing in
popularity. This theory states that the earth is more like a gigantic
"geode" with a hollow interior. In this case the "hollow" would not
coincide with the "bottomless" pit simply because the "inner surface"
pushes out- ward as opposed to the inward gravitational push of the outer
surface. However, if one were standing on the inner surface they would not
drift off to the center of the planet because they are attached or drawn to
the inner surface, not gravitationally but through centrifugal force (the
same force that one can see at work in a washing machine as the "spin"
cycle pushes everything against the inner surface, leaving a "hollow"
center). Several people in the past have proposed this theory, among them
Edmund Halley after whom "Halley's" comet is named; Capt. John Cleves
Symmes whose writings actually inspired a government expedition to the
North Pole -- as the theory states that the entrances to the inner hollow
exist somewhere near the north and south poles; and Cotton Mathers who was
a central figure in the "Salem Witch Trials". Also, countless science and
fantasy fiction writers have used this theme in their writings, some of the
more well-known authors being Edgar Rice Burroughs and Edgar Allen Poe.

If such a concavity exists, then how would the traditions of Hades,
Tartarus and Gehenna fit in to this new cosmography of a "Geoditic" planet?
One possibility is given by Dr. Hank Krastman, who claims that he was shown
an underground city below the Grand Canyon area by a blond-haired,
blue-eyed "Hopi" Indian. This city was connected to its counterpart on the
inner surface of the earth's (alleged) concavity, a city of Grecian-like
architecture called PALATKWAPI. In 1994 researcher B. Alan Walton sent
Krastman a letter in which he posed the following questions:

"...Have your Hopi sources mentioned anything about the nature of the earth
BETWEEN the outer and inner (hollow) crusts? I am particularly interested
in learning of conditions within the terminal zone where gravitational
"pull" and centrifugal "push" cancel each other out. My "theory" is that
there would be no gravity, and thus vast cavernous spaces. I would guess
that this would also include a chaotic environment similar to the Greek
tradition of Tartarus or the "Bottomless" (non-gravitational) Pit where
earth-material, magma, various chemicals and gases are being slammed
together in weightlessness by the rotational movement of the earth itself,
causing an inferno-like region where physical life could not exist, as it
(apparently) does on the inner and outer crusts of this giant "geode" known
as earth."

Hank Krastman's response, dated 11-27-94, was as follows:

"...The nature of the Earth between the outer and inner Earth is molten
Lava type rock... When I walked on the inside of the Earth it was the same
gravity pull, no difference, however the Air machines powered by the
eternal Sun, the sky is blue without any clouds 24 hours a day (Note: the
logistics of an internal "sun" at the center point, as suggested by several
earlier theorists, would seem to violate the laws of physics when com-
pared to the mass necessary for a "sun" or "star" to gain nuclear fusion
ability -- or whatever process is at work. Perhaps the "sun" that is
described is actually a "focal point" of the electro- magnetic currents
passing through the earth, similar to the pinpoint of light that can
sometimes be seen in the center of a spherical crystal. - Branton).

"The INFERNO region does exist in cavities between the two worlds. If you
saw the Movie STARGATE it is similar going through the gate to the inner
world."

Elsewhere Krastman stated that when he was transported to the interior
surface from the underground city below Arizona it was at the "speed of
light", suggesting that instantaneous travel was and is accomplished
between the two worlds via time-space windows, or teleportation rather then
via tunnels that pass through the "infernal" zones. Depending on the
source, the distance between the outer and inner surfaces may be anywhere
from 500 to 1500 miles!

In the Book of Revelation as well as other sections of Judeo- Christian
scripture there is a prophetic event described which some refer to as the
'rapture' (the word doesn't exist in the Bible although the 'concept'
does). This event is said to coincide with the disappearance of deceased
Christian believers from their graves. Since certain (non-human) alien
species have been known to 'counterfeit' divine or 'Biblical' events
through the application of high occult-technology, is it possible that this
prophetical event of the 'rapture' may also be 'counterfeited' for some
psychological or manipulative purpose?

The following incident was reported in the Oct. 1964 issue of SEARCH
magazine, by Will Carson in his column 'PRYING INTO THE UNKNOWN':

"A GRAVE MATTER -- J.E. was born in Spain, to which country her late
parents originally had immigrated from what was then called Bohemia. Their
native village has long since been submerged by the waters of a
hydro-electric project -- all of which pretty well obliterates our chances
of pinpointing the exact time and date. But as J.E. recalls her parents
relating many times, one day all the graves in the cemetery behind the now
vanished village were found to be empty, but there were no mounds of dirt
beside each grave. Upon further investigation the excavations proved to be
apparently bottomless!

"Authorities were never able to solve the mystery, and finally (since it
was impossible to refill the graves) they were boarded over and sealed with
mortar and a high stone fence built around the area."

The following is from an add describing a book written by 'Michael X' (no
relation to 'Commander X'), titled 'WE WANT YOU -- HITLER ALIVE', published
by UFO Review., Box 753., New Brunswick, NJ 08903:

     "DID HITLER CAPTURE ALIEN CREW & BUILD HIS OWN FLYING SAUCER?
     Here is proof Hitler escaped death, and tried to reorganize his
     mighty forces at the South Pole in underground bases...

     "Here also are clear--close up--photos of Hitler's own secret
     flying disks which he hoped would someday enable him to rule the
     world.

     "Discussed for the first time is the mysterious 'Mr. Michalek'
     who had toured Europe telling of his contacts with aliens and the
     establishment of the majestic government of the 'World Republic
     of Earth,' and how both Moscow and Washington would be 'wiped
     out' if they did not 'give in' to other worldly advice. Was he
     speaking on behalf of the Fuhrer?"

In reference to any possible International counter-offensive against the
'Grays', some have suggested that the 'threat' will be used by the
Illuminati as an excuse to unite the world together in a one-world
government. If in fact the Korean and Vietnam wars were 'orchestrated' by
the Serpent Cults as some have suggested, is it not likely that a United
Nations-backed counteroffensive against the grays will result in the same
type of no-win war with an eventual loss on our side? Especially if the
'One Worlders' are collaborating with the Grays and Reptons?

Perhaps it would be best for each individual nation to deal with the
reptilian infestation or undermining of their own countries in their own
way, without the help of a 'World Militia', or keep the battle at a 'grass
roots' level? Global COOPERATION on an ECONOMIC level might be tolerated by
freedom loving peoples, but Global CONTROL on a POLITICAL level definitely
will not be! A world 'Federation' may be maintained without surrendering
all national sovereignties to a one-world political force (namely, the NEW
WORLD ORDER). Those extraterrestrials who profess the need for a One World
Government on earth as a prerequisite to join their Alliances or
Federations should realize that the cultural diversity on Earth is unique
in the universe, and therefore a 'unique' answer to the problem should be
suggested, namely that they attempt to align themselves with the
governments of individual sovereign nations, and offer them memberships
within their Confederations, rather than wait for the world to turn into a
global police state.

The one-world Republic that 'they' so desperately seek could just as easily
become a one-world dictatorship that would be controlled by despotes,
allied to the Grays for instance, who might bear animosity to the
Federation(s). On the other hand if an individual nation were to become a
member of such a Fed- eration, they could enjoy the benefits of such
cooperation. Such a plan must include the promise of the Federation(s) to
come to the aid of that nation in a DEFENSIVE manner if it is being
threatened by another nation, especially one backed by an opposing
interstellar group. But such an agreement must absolutely prohibit any type
of OFFENSIVE attack on the part of the host nation across its borders and a
strict compliance with an inter- national non-interference policy. It goes
without saying that, for instance, such a nation would have the right to
root-out any subsurface "base" utilized by parasitical groups such as the
grays that are being used as centers of abduction, mutilation, implant-
ation and other such activities AGAINST the inhabitants of that nation. The
Federation is fully justified in admitting individual nations into its
fold, and this should not be misconstrued as a violation of their "Prime
Directive", ESPECIALLY since the reptilian grays have already established
their own destructive alliances with various national governments
throughout the world. In light of this such a plan is the ONLY way that the
Federations, Alliances, etc., can salvage their own interests for the
future of planet earth.

Now to continue with the subject of how individual nations are responding
to the reality of alien contact, the Oct-Nov. issue of NEXUS Magazine
related the following information in an article titled 'UK RADIO PROGRAMME
ON UFO COVERUP':

"...The following is an example of what one can pick up off the computer
networks. The network in this case is called EarthNet, run by Pegasus
Networks based in Byron Bay (P.O. Box 201., Byron Bay NSW 2481).

** Topic: Aliens from outer space... **

** Written 12:14 am, Aug. 5, 1991 by huw in peg:sci.astro **

"'I recently heard a Radio One program in the UK that contained an
interview with a leading proponent of the popular 'US Government has aliens
locked up and is experimenting with their space planes' conspiracy theory.
However this particular individual sounded very reasonable, did not make
any outrageous claims, and further had some interesting facts to disclose.
In particular he mentioned several verifiable facts which I would like some
follow up on:

"'Rockwell International and NASA were planning a *massive* joint
exhibition of space exploration this year (1991) but it was delayed
inexplicably until 1992. In the *official* prospectus for this exhibition,
one of the exhibits was clearly stated to be 'an extraterrestrial
spacecraft'. When asked about this by various individuals, all enquiries
were referred by NASA to the US DoD. An unnamed Pentagon spokesman speaking
off the record is meant to have indicated that they 'had a number of such
space vehicles to choose from...'

"'The Pentagon also held a press conference to deal with press inquiries on
this matter -- and refused to answer any questions. In fact reporters later
said that the Pentagon had asked most of the questions, and they all
pertained to 'what would be the public reaction if...'.

"'The guy on the radio program referred extensively to two NASA consultant
engineers who claimed to have worked on alien spacecraft studying
propulsion systems for NASA -- both had high level security clearances in
the States...'"

Tim Beckley's UFO REVIEW [issue #37] carried the following article by the
editor titled 'ET SAUCERS VS. EARTH MADE UFOS'. We quote excerpts here
beginning with a reference to researcher William Cooper:

"...(William Cooper) will, he says, 'prove once and for all that the Secret
Societies, NOT our [Constitutional] government, murdered President Kennedy
as a sacrifice to the ancient god Baal in an outdoor temple.' Cooper will
also [in future lectures] 'explain the true meaning of the movie 2001 as a
message of the secret societies to their followers, and will show a
first-generation color copy of the Zapruder film with all the previously
missing frames...'

"THE 'ANTI-GRAVITY' WORLD OF VLADIMIR TERZISKI:

"...According to Terziski, the Nazi's were building flying saucers that
took them to other planets even before the start of World War II. Being a
Slav, Vladimir says he cannot but have the 'utmost revulsion towards
everything Hitler's racial and political philosophies stood for,' and it is
because of his revulsion he decided to look into various 'black
technologies' developed by THE NAZIS, whom he now believes were secretly
backed by the sinister Illuminati operating way behind the scenes (Note: As
can be seen elsewhere in this File the 'link' between the Illuminati and
the Nazi's seems to have been the gnostic Jesuit and Thule Societies -
Branton).

"In his vast collection of photos and other documents, Terziski has many
pictures and drawings of the various disk-shaped craft constructed by the
Nazi scientists that were powered by Schauberger turbines and Kohler
TACHYON magneto-gravitic drives (all based upon free energy or anti-gravity
principles). Actually, Vladimir says that we've known all about
anti-gravity for a long time and that THE BRITISH (Marconi Group) MAY
ACTUALLY HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON A CENTURY AGO, AND EVEN THE VATICAN HAS A
GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WHO ROCKET OFF INTO SPACE FROM SOUTH AMERICAN BASES
FROM TIME TO TIME.

"Meanwhile, deep underground at Area 51's 'Dream Lab' in the Nevada desert,
a renegade branch of the CIA -- protected by a private security SS-like
police force that the Illuminati supplies -- is constructing their own
fleet of 'flying saucers' utilizing Hitler's forbidden technology..."

Elsewhere in this File we have written of the alleged 'Federation' which
loosely ties together such human colonies as those in TAU CETI, EPSILON
ERIDANI, the TAYGETA and other systems of the PLEIADES, VEGA in LYRA,
various colonies in the HYADES, the alleged SOLARIAN Tribunal on the moons
of SATURN, ALPHA CENTAURI, various cultures from the ANDROMEDA
constellation, the KOLDASIAN and other systems from the DAL or antimatter
universe, and the 'UMMITES' in WOLF 424 [all of which have been repeatedly
described by numerous and apparently separate 'contactees]'. One additional
allegation is that the 'UMMITES', a 'Scandinavian' appearing race who live
on a planet with a magnetic field much more intense than that of earth,
have apparently made contact with scientists associated with the French and
Spanish governments. It is interesting that M.K. Jessup's annotated version
of the 'CASE FOR THE UFO' contains comments by alleged members of an
ancient terran race who have access to inter- planetary craft technology.

These have stated that France, for instance, has been the subject of much
interest among certain ex-terran cultures because of it's unique social
atmosphere. The UMMITES allegedly come from the star system we know of as
Wolf 424, a star which they themselves refer to as IUMMA. Their 'insignia'
resembles an 'H' with an extra vertical 'bar' in the middle and the four
corners of the 'H' tapered into an outward curve. This symbol has been
PHOTOGRAPHED on the underside of some UFO's which have been encountered in
the 20th century. Also the UMMITES speak of themselves as belonging to a
large 'Federation' of planets, possibly consisting more or less of the
interstellar regions described above. They seem to have a particularly
strong alliance with the Oriental-like Vegans, who are a remnant of the
ancient Lyran civilization that gave rise to the present human cultures in
the Pleiades.

The following are several abbreviated excerpts taken from 'THE OMEGA
PROJECT', by Kenneth Ring, PH.D. (William Morrow & Co., N.Y. 1972). The
following points were brought out in the book:

---- Most abductions (possibly between 60%-80%? - Branton) are conducted by
the 'greys' of traditional description.

---- Many state that their experiences are often 'dreamlike' yet with
evidence suggesting real events.

---- The 'greys' (and in some cases black creatures in 'capes' that act as
'guards' during the painful and terrifying 'medical operations') have a way
of 'blurring' their faces in the minds of the abductees, so that the
abductee cannot later recall what the aliens' 'face' looked like.

---- Many abductees experience sleeping problems (not to mention severe
social-relational-sexual problems) after being abducted by the saurian or
reptilian grays, and these problems often last for years afterwards.

---- Some abductees who resist are 'shocked' repeatedly with an 'electric
gadget' which may induce paralysis and/or unconsciousness.

---- A majority of the 'greys' seem to be of the grey-white variety, some
with opaque 'black' eyes and some with vertically slit (snake or
lizard-like) pupils.

---- Some of the greys are described as 'sinister', and one abductee stated
that when she was taken "one alien was by my head and attempted to frighten
me with his large eyes," as three other creatures mechanically performed
painful operations, unheeding of her terrified cries to make them stop. She
(Clair Chambers) stated that "In my many encounters where I have always
been kidnapped from my home, the aliens have shown no compassion. I have
several times felt them exhibit FEAR when I have hit them as they do feel
FEAR... their reaction behavior patterns do NOT indicate an intelligence as
high as I would expect from their technology (Due to their "collective-
consciousness" nature? - Branton)... these experiences have been dreadful,
terrifying, and I would like them to stop!" (Note: Four separate doctors
have confirmed various wounds and injuries in Clair Chambers which she
insists resulted from the abductions).

---- Some 'greyish' aliens, with 3-digit fingers, have been described as
being 7 ft. tall (Reptons? - Branton). One woman who was abducted by them
felt as if the creatures wanted her to have the IMPRESSION that they were
'friendly', but after being returned to her car from which she was abducted
"I then broke to pieces as my whole body shook uncontrollably. I cried 'OH
GOD, WHY ME?' I couldn't calm myself as I cried like a baby..."

---- A woman with an M.S.W. [degree?] (who was at the time of this
revelation 51 years old), stated:

     "...The first experience was when I was a child of about 5. For
     years I had a RECURRING 'dream' of standing beside a field WHEN A
     HOLE OPENS UP IN THE GROUND in front of me. The dream ends with
     me looking into the hole. I was just standing there looking at
     the hole. Under hypnosis I [recall that I] stepped into the hole
     and walked down a short tunnel. The tunnel widened into a small
     waiting area where there was a bench just at the right height for
     a 5 year old. I sat down and waited. A tall black 'featureless'
     being came through a doorway, walked to me and held out his hand.
     I took his hand and went back through the doorway with him. He
     placed me on a table that appeared to be about 3 to 4 feet high.
     He laid me on my back and took one big hand and held my upper
     body flat on the table. The other beings were behind him looking
     at instruments on the wall. I was held this way for several
     minutes. When the being turned to look at the other two, it was
     as if he lost CONTROL over me and I jerked out from under his
     hand, fell off the end of the table and ran for the door. When I
     got to the door, I knew I wasn't 'supposed' to go any further. I
     stopped and turned around. The being who had been holding me came
     to me, took hold of my left arm and looked into my eyes. I was
     looking at where the eyes should be on a HUMAN, BUT I don't
     REMEMBER actually SEEING eyes. I feel something was communicated,
     but I don't know what."

---- The author states that some of the large opaque-black 'eyes' seen by
many abductees, after being taken by the greys, seemed to have been
'coverings' for real 'eyes' which they felt might have been hidden behind
or inside of what might have been artificial opaque-black visual coverings.
At least this was the 'impression' that some abductees had.

The following article, 'THE INCREDIBLE REVELATIONS OF DR. KUEPPERS', by
Helga Morrow, also appeared in UFO REVIEW - issue #37, with the following
heading: "He Escaped From Nazi Germany At The Height Of World War II And
Came To America To Work For The U.S. Military On Top Secret Projects
Involving Invisibility, Time [Manipulation], Anti-Gravity Research And
Teleportation:

     "Editors Note: The following is a highly-abbreviated account of
     Helga Morrow's recollections of her late father, Dr. Fred A.
     Kueppers, a German-born engineer who defected to the U.S. during
     World War II...

     "[Helga's Story] 'I have learned from various sources that my
     father was one of the scientists who worked on the Philadelphia
     Experiment; had invented the timing device for the A-bomb; had
     been chosen by the bomb scientists to represent them to Harry
     Truman, asking him NOT to drop the bomb; had invented the
     mathematical formula that brought the astronauts back; had
     designed the miniaturized electrical system of Sputnik, the first
     space launching; had worked on Project Blue Book/Black Book,
     UFOs; had initiated the use of aluminum wiring to replace the
     heavier wiring in World War II planes; had worked with mind
     warfare, using psychics to communicate with astronauts in case
     communication systems failed; and had trained extraterrestrials
     to fit into human society.

     "'My head spun; in it wheels were turning, and a thousand things
     began to make sense. Suddenly the things my father had told me in
     my childhood and youth snapped into place. It was as if nineteen
     years after I attended my father's funeral, I began to know him
     for the first time as only a few others knew him -- a man who,
     for obvious reasons, could never be mentioned in public records,
     but who had clearly deserved such recognition for the valuable
     service he had given the nation. My mind began to go back to my
     earliest remembrances...

     "'When I was in the second or third grade, I watched him hang up
     an award from RCA in his room. I asked, 'Why did you get this
     award?' He told me it was too lengthy to go into. I said, 'Try
     me!' and he did. He said it was an award for an experiment in
     time, and then proceeded to put two ashtrays on his bed, and
     through simple gestures and explanations, show how two objects
     could transpose in time and return the same way. Then he took me
     into the cellar, where he put some steel shavings in a cigar box
     with a large U-shaped magnet taped underneath. He gently tapped
     the steel shavings, and to my amazement, two distinct series of
     concentric circles gradually appeared! He then simplified this by
     saying that if one could transpose these circles, one could
     transpose time [or 'bend' time such as to speed it up or slow it
     down, or even stop it altogether? - Branton]. He said that alien
     spacecraft were partly moved by 'reverse magnetism.' He showed me
     how to get this effect by holding two opposite magnets.

     "'I never forgot this lesson. And this was BEFORE anyone really
     talked about flying saucers. I was Daddy's confidant. I never
     discussed this information with anyone; he had sworn me to
     secrecy.

     "'My father was not home much -- only several times a year. He
     was completely focused on his work, so normal family life was
     difficult for him...

     "'Daddy was a popular innovator in many fields of science and
     technology. All his patents became the property of either the
     company that employed him or the U.S. Government [Such patents,
     which have been established by various scientists working in
     anti-gravity research, allegedly exist in the patent offices for
     all to see, IF they only knew how and where to find them -
     Branton].

     . "'The third winter of 1961 before he died (February 12, 1962,
     Lincoln's birthday), my father confided many things to me. He
     told me that what he was about to tell me was bizarre,
     unbelievable and might sound absolutely crazy. I was 27 at the
     time, and thought he had gone off the deep-end (my mother had
     always thought so). Daddy assured me that by the time I reached
     55 or so, all these bizarre statements that he was about to make,
     as well as everything he had ever explained to me when I was a
     child, would come back to me and make sense.

     "'He told me that he had three months to live. 'They' had given
     him three months to conclude his personal affairs, he said. I
     asked, 'Who are they?' He said I wouldn't understand. So I
     realized that I was taking my last walk with him through
     Guilford. He turned around to see if he was being followed, as
     always, aware of intrusion. He confided that he had not only been
     on the moon but INSIDE it, and that he had both spoken to and
     trained extraterrestrials who looked like us to blend into human
     society. He had been in spaceships and had traveled in space.

     "'He told me of the riots where we would kill or be killed in a
     period of racial intolerance that would occur around 1966 --
     which is now history. He told me that red-baiting propaganda was
     a lie to keep humanity occupied with worry over 'fighting
     communism.' And that in reality the two nations were great
     friends; Russian scientists got along well with their American
     counterparts and worked amiably together. The Russian 'threat'
     was nothing but B.S. and a distraction for the public.

     "'In the meantime, there were alien bases all over the world and
     on the moon. He said that whoever controls the moon can target
     anyplace on Earth; no place would be safe. Therefore, Russians
     and Americans must remain friends or eliminate each other. He
     told me he had worked with Tesla, Einstein, Von Broun, Von
     Neumann and many others.

     "'My father broke down and cried when I visited him that
     Christmas. He said, 'If you only knew the real truth!' But as
     long as I didn't I was safe, he said. He seemed a frightened man
     alone with his thoughts, afraid to speak out, trusting no one. He
     rarely spoke on the phone (our phone had always been tapped) and
     always thought he was being followed.

     "'My father died in the hospital in the arms of a nun, we were
     told. When my mother wanted to send flowers and candy to this
     unknown nun, she was told that there had been no nun in his room
     (though we had seen her) at the time of his fatal 'heart attack'.
     She couldn't be traced. At his funeral, I saw two Secret Service
     men at his coffin (wearing the obvious trench coats)...

     "'There was something strange about the body in the coffin. I
     always remember my father's hairy arms and hands. But there was
     NO HAIR ON THOSE HANDS! His face felt like cold stone, and it had
     so much makeup that it looked like wax. Was it really my father
     in the coffin? If so, why had his grave 'disappeared' when I
     looked for it in the family plot in 1985 -- a plot that dated
     back hundreds of years? There was no trace that it had ever
     existed; there were no grave records!

     "'And then on May 30, 1962, several months later, he materialized
     before me and told me he was not dead but only in 'another
     dimension IN TIME!' I felt his suit, smelled his Molle shaving
     cream -- and his weight pushed down the mattress on my daybed. He
     was wearing his usual conservative grey suit; I even felt the
     material as I touched his knee. He told me to continue his work,
     but not call on him unless absolutely necessary, as appearing to
     me was painful. He said that he would make himself known to me
     'at the crossroads of my life' to help me (and he has kept his
     promise).'"

Based on other accounts, "another dimension in time" would probably
indicate that the dimension into which he had been "phased" was and is a
dimensional 'branch' off from the main- stream multi-dimensional reality
that is visible to us. Since time, space and matter are all integral parts
of the unified field, it has been theorized that another dimension "in
time" -- for instance a dimension in which the time-flow is accelerated
(one of 'their' days may equal one of 'our' hours, for instance) -- would
also include a spacial and molecular shift as well. This could be perceived
either as 'entering' another dimension or simply as a 'phasing' of an
individual to the point that he or she begins to 'perceive' and become part
of a dimension that was always there yet one which they could not
comprehend or interact with until they were 'tuned in' to it on the
molecular level. This dimension would be invisible to most of those within
the 'mainstream' of reality, and we would be invisible to them to some
extent (possibly an extent which is determined by the depth of the
molecular-time-space phasing).

Returning to the subject of alien activity, in particular the 'Grays',
there are those who believe that such activity has some apocalyptic and
theological significance. Could such activity have been prophesied in
ancient spiritual texts?

Leviticus 26:22 (in the TORAH or OLD TESTEMENT) relates a strange warning,
possibly directed against those nations who tend to ignore the command of
the Almighty or the Creator to live together in brotherly love... Could
this be a prophecy of a coming invasion of alien 'beasts' such as the
Grays? The Torah describes the serpent race as 'beasts' in Genesis chapter
3, although it also makes it clear that these reptilians were by far the
most superior, "subtil" and intelligent members of the entire 'animal'
kingdoms. We quote this passage as follows (see also: Amos 9:2-3):

     "I WILL ALSO SEND WILD BEASTS AMONG YOU, WHICH SHALL ROB YOU OF
     YOUR CHILDREN, AND DESTROY YOUR CATTLE, AND MAKE YOU FEW IN
     NUMBER, AND YOUR [HIGH] WAYS SHALL BE DESOLATE."
