             Conspiracy for the Day -- July 23, 1993

 
"A strange series of incidents in the University of Colorado 
Unidentified Flying Objects study has led to a near-mutiny by 
several of the staff scientists, the dismissal of two Ph.D's on 
the staff and the resignation of the project's administrative 
assistant."
 
"The study, announced as a totally objective scientific 
investigation of one of the most puzzling phenomena of modern 
times, has already cost the taxpayer over half a million dollars. 
The committee is scheduled to release its report by the end of 
the year."
 
"The announcement by the Secretary of Defense in October, 1966, 
that the Air Force had selected Dr. Edward U. Condon and the 
University of Colorado for the UFO research contract was welcomed 
both by skeptical observers and those convinced of the existence 
of flying saucers."
 
"Maj. Donald Keyhoe and his National Investigations Committee on 
Aerial Phenomena [NICAP], who were among the severest critics of 
the Air Force's study, publicly announced cautious support and 
offered NICAP's nation-wide UFO reporting system to the new 
research group."
 
"The project staff received a minor jolt early in October of 
1966, when the Denver *Post* published a story: CU [Colorado 
University] AIDE SLAPS UFO STUDY. [Robert J.] Low was quoted as 
saying that the UFO project 'comes pretty close to the criteria 
of nonacceptability' as a university function."
 
This embarrassment did not delay the project, however. Dr. 
McDonald was called on to give an address to members of the 
Condon committee.
 
"McDonald had carried out an extensive investigation on his own. 
After examining the hundreds of well-documented reports of 
sightings by military and airline pilots, radar operators, 
police, technical observers, and articulate, rational laymen, 
McDonald rejected as highly unlikely such conventional 
explanations for UFO's as ball lightning (plasma), 
hallucinations, hoaxes and misinterpretations of natural 
phenomena. He concluded that 'only abysmally limited scientific 
competence has been brought to the study of UFOs within Air Force 
circles in the past 15 years. Unfortunately, during all this 
time, the scientific community and the public were repeatedly 
assured that substantial scientific talent was being used...'"
 
"The first major turbulence in the new project [occurred] in 
February, 1967... [On January 25, Dr. Condon] spoke before a 
chapter of Sigma Xi, the honorary scientific fraternity. The 
Elmira, N.Y., *Star-Gazette* reported:"
 
    Unidentified flying objects "are not the business 
    of the Air Force,"... Dr. Edward U. Condon said 
    here Wednesday night... Dr. Condon left no doubt as 
    to his personal sentiments on the matter: "It is my 
    inclination right now to recommend that the 
    Government get out of this business. My attitude 
    right now is that there's nothing to it." With a 
    smile, he added, "but I'm not supposed to reach a 
    conclusion for another year..."
 
 
Major Keyhoe's reaction? "He bristled. He knew that Condon had 
not yet investigated any field cases personally, nor had any 
members of the staff completed any meaningful research. The 
project was only three months old. 'I have to admit,' Keyhoe told 
David Saunders, a key staff member, 'that I'm shocked by these 
statements. Is this a scientific investigation or isn't it?'"
 
Then, a staff member searching through project files (under the 
heading "Air Force Contract and Background") to obtain material 
for a speech came across a startling memorandum. "The staff 
member found most of the material... rather dull going, but one 
memo, written by [Robert J.] Low to university officials on 
August 9, 1966, contained [the following:]"
 
               -+- The Low Memorandum -+-
 
    ...Our study would be conducted almost exclusively by 
    non-believers who, although they couldn't possibly 
    *prove* a negative result, could and probably would add 
    an impressive body of evidence that there is no reality 
    to the observations. The trick would be, I think, to 
    describe the project so that, to the public, it would 
    appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific 
    community, would present the image of a group of 
    nonbelievers trying their best to be objective, but 
    having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer. 
    One way to do this would be to stress investigation, not 
    of the physical phenomena, but rather of the people who 
    do the observing -- the psychology and sociology of 
    persons and groups who report seeing UFOs. If the 
    emphasis were put here, rather than on examination of 
    the old question of the physical reality of the saucer, 
    I think the scientific community would quickly get the 
    message... I'm inclined to feel at this early stage 
    that, if we set up the thing right and take pains to get 
    the proper people involved and have success in 
    presenting the image we want to present to the 
    scientific community, we could carry the job off to our 
    benefit...
 
 
On September 18, 1967, "Condon, Low and Saunders met for the 
first time in many weeks. As a result of reading the [Low] memo, 
Saunders was deeply concerned... [At the meeting] Saunders was 
led to believe that if by chance the Extra Terrestrial 
Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis was substantiated, the announcement 
would be sent by Condon directly to the Air Force and the 
President, and never be allowed to go to the public."
 
Around this same time, word got out that Dr. Condon had made 
another embarrassing speech. "A report of the new Condon speech 
had already reached Dr. McDonald in a letter from a colleague at 
the University of Arizona, William S. Bickel, assistant professor 
of physics on the campus. '...Dr. Condon's speech was funny and 
entertaining,' Bickel wrote. 'But to me, it was also 
disappointing and surprising. Dr. Condon emphasized mostly funny 
things. He told of an offer made to him by a contactee, who, for 
a sizable sum deposited in the right bank, would introduce him to 
a UFO crew... He told how he tracked the case down and concluded 
that it was very likely a hoax... My feelings about UFOs are 
similar to those of many people -- I don't know what they are, I 
believe people are seeing real things, and I believe a scientific 
attack on the problem will solve the mystery -- whatever they 
are... The net effect of Dr. Condon's talk was zero, if not 
negative...'"
 
"In reply to Bickel, McDonald wrote, '...The crackpots are so 
immediately recognizable that one need not waste any time at all 
on them... I fail to understand why a scientific group should be 
given an address by any member of the Colorado team on the topic 
of the crackpot fringe...'"
 
"On September 27, the *Rocky Mountain News* (Denver, Colo.) 
published this headline: UFO RESEARCH CHIEF AT CU DISENCHANTED. 
Condon was quoted as saying: 'I'm almost inclined to think such 
studies ought to be discontinued unless someone comes up with a 
new idea on how to approach the problem... The 21st century may 
die laughing when it looks back on many things we have done. This 
[the UFO study] may be one."
 
"The majority of the staff began exploring several proposals, 
including the possibility of the entire staff resigning en masse 
or issuing a press release or a minority report. Another proposal 
was the establishment of an independent scientific group to 
explore the rational sighting reports and eliminate the crackpot- 
fringe static. There was general agreement that an objective 
study of the UFO problem should be made and that accurate and 
unbiased findings should reach the National Academy of Sciences, 
the public and the Air Force... Several members of the staff told 
of their concern that the content and form of the final report 
would reflect what they now felt was Condon's and Low's prejudice 
and would be unjustifiably negative."
 
In a January, 1968 telephone conversation with Low, McDonald 
indicated to Low his alarm that "negative findings were already 
being clearly expressed by both Low and Condon." When Low hung up 
in anger, McDonald wrote him a long letter in which he reviewed 
his [McDonald's] complaints. Low did not get around to reading 
the letter until February 6, 1968.
 
"On Wednesday, February 7, Saunders was summoned to Condon's 
office. Low and Condon were present. The questioning focussed on 
the [Low] memo. Did Saunders know of it and know where it was 
kept? Saunders said that the memo was only part of the whole 
problem... The broader issues of scientific integrity were at 
stake. Condon, furious that he had not immediately been informed 
that McDonald knew of the [Low] memo, told Saunders, 'For an act 
like that, you ought to be ruined professionally.'"
 
"Saunders countered by saying that Condon and Low seemed to be 
treating the symptoms rather than the disease. He reminded them 
of the efforts of the entire staff to get Low and Condon to 
modify their intractable stance. He reviewed the long sequence of 
events and reminded Low that he had blocked the investigation of 
one particularly startling UFO case."
 
"Dr. Levine was summoned while Saunders was still in Condon's 
office. Saunders offered to stay. Low rose from his chair and 
physically ushered him out the door. Levine was unnerved by the 
forcible ejection of Saunders. Again, the questioning went 
straight to the [Low] memo... Condon asked why Levine had not 
brought the [Low] memo to him, and Levine said that Condon's 
public and private statements had indicated that there was little 
likelihood of effective communication. He told Condon that Low 
had slammed the door in his face when he brought up the handling 
by Low of an Edwards Air Force Base case."
 
Mrs. Armstrong, Low's administrative assistant, "had joined the 
project at its inception with no convictions whatever about UFOs. 
By February, 1967, she was convinced that the study was being 
gravely misdirected."
 
"She talked to Condon on February 22, 1968, at his office. She 
told him frankly that there appeared to be an almost unanimous 
lack of confidence in the project coordinator and his scientific 
direction of the project... She said that her long, close 
association with Low gave strong evidence that he was trying very 
hard to say as little as possible in the final report, and to say 
that in the most negative way possible."
 
"The others who left the project also felt they had an obligation 
to speak out, and when Condon failed to respond positively to his 
outspoken letter of criticism, McDonald brought the matter before 
the executive officers of the National Academy of Sciences in a 
vigorous written protest."
 
"The hope that the establishment of the Colorado study brought 
with it has dimmed. All that seems to be left is the $500,000 
[pricetag]."

The following is excerpted from a British journal (now defunct) 
of the time, the *Flying Saucer Review* {2} [See notes below]. 
The author, Charles Gibbs-Smith, was "one of the world's foremost 
aviation historians and [wrote] many books for the London Science 
Museum. [Mr. Gibbs-Smith] holds the degree of M.A. from his 
family university of Harvard (U.S.A.)."
 
               -+- A Question of Integrity -+-
 
"For the purposes of this article, I am not concerned whether 
UFOs are vehicles from outer space, hamburgers tossed from 
balloons, or spots in front of the eyes of neurotic tabby cats. I 
am concerned with the status and standing of a scientific report, 
the Condon Report 'of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying 
Objects,' completed in 1968 and released to the Press in January 
1969."
 
[...]
 
[Gibbs-Smith quotes from the Low memorandum, already quoted 
above.] "This memorandum was accidentally discovered by a 
researcher late in 1967, and was revealed to the public in *Look* 
magazine in May of 1968."
 
[...]
 
"*The Low memorandum can only be viewed as a deliberate act 
calculated to deceive; to deceive first the scientific community, 
and, through them, the public at large*. I know of no modern 
parallel to such a cynical act of duplicity on the part of a 
university official dedicated, presumably, to the pursuit of 
truth. By the writing of such a document, the integrity of the 
entire project was shattered in advance. Mr. Low's words disclose 
that everything in the report -- unbeknown to the reader, be he 
scientist or layman -- would ultimately play its part in 
presenting the angled case whereby the 'scientific community 
would quickly get the message.' This, in plain language, means 
that a deliberate perversion of the truth was planned *before* 
the contract with the Air Force was signed; which, in turn, 
points to an *agreement* with someone, or some body, as to what 
that 'message' should be."
 
[...]
 
"The Low memorandum also conveys an implied contempt for the 
subject of the UFOs which the University was being handsomely 
paid to investigate; and contempt is not compatible with 
scientific investigation... What underlines the dishonesty which 
surrounds the whole project is the fact that *at no time has the 
Low memorandum been repudiated, or even deplored by any of the 
parties to the deal; nor -- to its shame -- by the American 
Academy of Sciences*. Neither the University of Colorado nor the 
Air Force has had a word of explanation to offer for behaviour 
which cuts at the very roots of scientific integrity."
