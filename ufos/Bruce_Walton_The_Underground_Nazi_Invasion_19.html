 [PART 19]

GERMAN SUBMARINES IN SOUTH ATLANTIC

The newspaper *France Soir* had the following account: "Almost 1-1/2 years
AFTER cessation of hostilities in Europe, the Islandic Whaler, "Juliana" was
stopped by a large German U-boat. The Juliana was in the ANTARCTIC region
around Malvinas [now Falkland] Islands when a German submarine surfaced
and raised the German official naval Flag of Mourning -- red with a black edge.

The submarine commander sent out a boarding party, which approached the
Juliana in a rubber dinghy, and having boarded the whaler demanded of Capt.
Hekla part of his fresh food stocks. The request was made in the definite
tone of an order to which resistance would have been unwise. The German
officer spoke a correct English and paid for his provisions in U.S. dollars, giving
the Captain a bonus of $10 for each member of the Juliana crew. Whilst the
food stuffs were being transferred to the submarine, the submarine commander
informed Capt. Hekla of the exact location of a large school of whales. Later
the Juliana found the school of whales where designated."

The French *Agence France Press* on 25 September 1946, said: "The contin-
uous rumours about German U-boat activity in the region of Tierra del Fuego
(Feuerland, in German), between the southernmost tip OF LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CONTINENT OF ANTARCTICA are based on true happenings."

There have been stories and books written about Germans counterfeiting U.S.
currency and otherwise obtaining American money printing plates, which may
account for the German use of American money.

The Guinness Book of World Records says that the "greatest unsolved robbery"
was the disappearance of the entire German treasury at the end of the war.


RAND CORPORATION

In January 1946 industrialist Donald Douglas approached the Army Air Force
with a plan for government and industry to work together on long range strategic
planning. This was called Project RAND, a name coined by Arthur Raymond
from Research ANd Development. Much of their first government money went
to the von Braun team. (McDougall, Walter al. ...*the Heavens and the Earth,
A Political History of the Space Age,* Basic Books, New York, 1985, p. 89.)


LESLIE R. GROVES

Groves is known as the General in charge of the Manhattan Project which
built the Atomic Bomb. He was chosen because he is the one who supervised
the building of the Pentagon (It is said that high Masons supervised the con-
struction of most of the governmental buildings in Washington D.C.  No doubt
Groves was a high-ranking Scottish Rite Mason, which in turn would make
him a member of the Bavarian Illuminati.  A study of a street map of down-
town D.C. will reveal a pentagram-like street layout at the tip of which lies the
Scottish Rite headquarters for America, the "House of the Temple".  13 blocks
from this is the White House itself, the Washington Monument, the Pentagon
and other structures which are encompased by the "pentagram". - Wol.), and
by 1942 [Groves] was in charge of all U.S. military construction everywhere.
After the war he went to work for Remington RAND Corporation.


BORIS PASH

"The stakes in the search for the scientific expertise of Germany were high.
The single most important American strike force, for example, was the Alsos
raiding team, which targeted Axis atomic research, uranium stockpiles, and
nuclear scientists, as well as Nazi chemical and biological warfare research.
The commander of this assignment was U.S. Army Colonel Boris Pash, who
had previously been security chief of the Manhattan Project -- the United States'
atomic bomb development program -- and who later played an important role
in  highly secret U.S. covert action programs.

Pash succeeded brilliantly in his mission, seizing top German scientists and
more than 70,000 tons of Axis uranium ore and radium products. The uranium
taken during these raids was eventually shipped to the United States and in-
corporated in U.S. atomic weapons." (Simpson, Christopher, *Blowback,*
Collier Books, New York, 1988, p. 26.)

"...Another notable Bloodstone veteran is Boris Pash, a career intelligence
officer identified in the Final Report of the U.S. Senate's 1975-1976 investigation
into U.S. intelligence activities as the retired director of the CIA unit responsible
for planning assassinations" (*Blowback,* p. 108).

*Blowback,* p. 152-153 says: "The records of Operation Bloodstone add an
important new piece of information to one of the most explosive public issues
of today: the role of the U.S. government -- specifically the CIA -- in assassi-
nations and attempted assassinations of foreign officials. According to a 1976
Senate investigation, a key official of Operation Bloodstone is the OPC officer
who was specifically delegated responsibility for planning the agency's assas-
sinations, kidnappings, and similar 'wet work.'

"Colonel Boris Pash, one of the most extraordinary and least known characters
in American intelligence history... his work for U.S. intelligence agencies places
him in the critical office given the responsibility for planning postwar assassi-
nation operations... Colonel Pash is one of the few remaining originals of U.S.
intelligence, and his experience in 'fighting the communists' goes back to the
1917 Russian Revolution.

He was in Moscow and Eastern Europe in those days with his father, a mis-
sionary of Russian extraction, and the young Pash spent much of the Soviet
civil war working on the side of the White armies, then with Czarist refugees
who had fled their country. In the 1920s Pash signed on as a reserve officer
with the U.S. military intelligence service... he... played a role in the internment
of Japanese civilians in California, and was soon assigned as chief counterintel-
ligence officer on the Manhattan Project, the supersecret U.S. effort to develop
the atomic bomb. (More than a decade later it was Colonel Pash's testimony
that helped seal the fate of scientist Robert Oppenheimer in the well-known
1954 security case.)

Before the war was out, it will be recalled, Colonel Pash led the series of
celebrated special operations known as the Alsos Mission that were designed
to capture the best atomic and chemical warfare experts that the Nazis had
to offer.

"After the war Colonel Pash served as the army's representative on Bloodstone
in the spring of 1948, when the tasks of that project, including recruiting defect-
ors, smuggling refugees out from behind the Iron Curtain, and assassinations,
were established. Bloodstone's 'special operations,' as defined by the Pentagon,
could 'include clandestine warfare, subversion, sabotage and... assassination,'
according to the 1948 Joint Chiefs of Staff records. In March 1949, Pash was
assigned by the army to the OPC division of the CIA... His five-man CIA unit,
known as PB/7, was given a written charter that read in part that 'PB/7 will be
responsible for assassinations, kidnapping, and such other functions as from
time to time may be given it... by higher authority.'"

From *Dulles* by Leonard Mosley (A Biography of Eleanor, Allen and John
Foster. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1978.), we find, p. 459: "But now he
[Allen Dulles] was interested in the more sinister Agency experiments in
mind-bending drugs, portable phials of lethal viruses, and esoteric poisons
that killed without trace. Allen's sense of humor was touched when he learned
that the unit working on these noxious enterprises was called the *Health
Alteration Committee* (directed by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and Boris Pash)...
Richard Bissell... had now succeeded Frank Wisner as deputy director of
Plans..."

To learn more about the mind-control and torture experiments of Pash and
Gottlieb, read *Journey Into Madness: The True Story of Secret CIA Mind
Control and Medical Abuse* by Gordon Thomas (Bantam Books, New York,
1989).

One of the people they killed was Frank Olson (a CIA germ warfare doctor
whose specialty was anthrax), while they were working on Subproject-68,
also known as MK-ULTRA. MK-ULTRA started as *Project Bluebird,* set up
on April 20, 1950, by CIA Director Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (who later
was a member of NICAP), and on July 20, 1950, they began using sodium
amytal, Benzedrine and other drugs to "brainwash" prisoners. (Note: Accord-
ing to one source Admiral Hillenkoetter was part of MJ-12, with the designation
'MJ-1'. - Wol.)

In September 1950, the *Miami News* published an article under the headline
BRAIN WASHING TACTICS which was considered the first formal use of the
term. One of Gottlieb's partners was Dr. Harold Wolff, who appears to be a
PAPERCLIP doctor. He worked with Parke-Davis and "...remained closely
connected with the M-K ULTRA brainwashing project" (p. 191). He helped
set up an apartment and introduce LSD to the hippies in San Francisco, and
worked on Project Mindbender (a Manchurian-Candidate type operation) with
WILLIAM BUCKLEY.

Isn't it interesting that so many of the participants in the most secret of secrets
of World War II are still very involved in the Kennedy assassination and other
more current affairs. Many books and articles have been written about the CIA
being involved in the JFK assassination, and now you know that the man in
charge of CIA assassinations was Boris Pash, formerly chief of security for
the Manhattan Project. He was also head of the group trying to capture Hitler's
advanced technology, including "flying saucers" and other secrets.

The book *ZR Rifle -- The Plot To Kill Kennedy And Castro* by Claudia Furiati,
p. 36, says that a man named William Harvey had been in charge of the CIA
post in West Berlin until 1960, then was placed in charge of CIA assassina-
tions by Richard Bissell in 1961. The plans to assassinate political leaders
was code-named *ZR-RIFLE,* headed by Harvey. Bo Gritz said on p. 525 of
his book: "The Kennedy assassination was code-named 'ZR-RIFLE'." It seems
apparent to me that Harvey and Pash were wearing the same pair of pants.

In 1941, Ian Fleming, the future creator of the "James Bond" stories, and at
that time a high ranking officer of British Intelligence, suggested to William
Donovan that he set up a specially trained and selected assassination unit.
PB/7 (Pash Boris Seven) was the original of the "Agent 007" concept. If my
memory is correct, I believe Nixon stated that William Harvey was the real
007.

I assume Pash was Agent 001, or perhaps he had seven agents working for
him (originally five). If you want to understand more of how these various
factions such as CIA, KGB, Nazis, Communists, FBI, etc., can be fighting
each other AND working together at the same time, you need to understand
who was ABOVE them, CONTROLLING them. To understand that, look to
British Intelligence! You will find British Intelligence to be an operation of
British and European Royalty and "Aristocracy"! (And according to former
British Intelligence agent John Coleman, British Intelligence is interlinked
with the Rothschild's Wicca-Masonic world network -- ONE of the THREE
world manipulating forces which operate under the Bavarian Empire or the
Bavarian Thule/Vril/Illuminati/Skull & Bones/Rosicrucian/OTO/BMS<Babylon-
ian Mystery Society>etc. serpent cults which trace back to ancient Egypt
and Babylon; the other two 'world manipulating forces' being the Black Nobility
and the Maltese Jesuits. - Wol.)

E. Howard Hunt, while in prison in December, 1975, in an interview with the
*New York Times,* said that the head of the CIA assassination unit was Boris
Pash. Pash was assigned to Angleton at this time (see *Final Judgment,*
p. 207). Angleton was head of the Israel desk of the CIA... He was also closely
involved with Meyer Lansky.

In *Cold Warrior,* the biography of James Jesus Angleton by Tom Mangold,
he says on page 362: "I would like to place on the record, however, that Angle-
ton's closest professional friends overseas, then and subsequently, came
from the Mossad -- the Israeli intelligence-gathering service (and which, by the
way, has a strong CIA controlling-influence within.  Can you imagine Mossad
being influenced by an agency created by Nazi double-agents?  This is pos-
sible because the facsicts who control the CIA have intentionally compart-
mentalized the agency to the point that each 'cell' has only a small picture
of what is really going on.  Part of the CIA's involement with Mossad may
involve their desire to incite warfare between the Arabs and Jews as part of
a plan to initiate a Third World War that will result in the obliteration of the
old international order, which they intend to replace with their "New World
Order". - Wol.) and that he [Angleton] was held in immense esteem by his
Israeli colleagues and by the state of Israel, which was to award him profound
honors after his death." His place was taken after his death by William Colby.
When Kissinger wanted to "get LaRouche," he turned to Angleton for help.
Angleton's tombstone is in Hebrew.

On page 97 of *Final Judgment,* Piper says that "The ZR/Rifle Team, in fact,
was one of Angleton's pet in-house CIA projects, which he ran in conjunction
with his CIA colleague, William Harvey."

According to Claudia Furiati, Joseph Schreider was in charge of the CIA
laboratories and of developing poisons for assassinations, and says that
Harvey was in charge of political assassinations, working out of the Miami
office run by [Paperclip operative] Shackley, and was working with Schreider
to try to poison Castro. Above we have Boris Pash and Sidney Gottlieb work-
ing together in the same manner. We have Pash and Harvey in the same
locations, doing the same jobs, in charge of the same projects -- talk about
featherbedding. I believe that Harvey was actually at headquarters in Langley,
over Shackley in Miami.

*Blowback,* p. 153, says that Pash "...served as the Army's representative
on Bloodstone in the spring of 1948, when the tasks of that project, including
recruiting defectors, smuggling refugees out from behind the Iron Curtain, and
assassinations, were established. In March 1949, Pash was assigned by the
Army to the OPC division of the CIA."

Harvey died June 6, 1976, according to Dick Russell, and Pash was in his
80s in 1988 according to Simpson.
