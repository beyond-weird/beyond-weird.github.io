MYSTERY-MAVERICK JIM MCCAMPBELL TAKES ON THE DULCE-BENNEWITZ ENIGMA





The following document [among others] originated from a U.S. Intelligence
worker who has been missing for quite some time. Concerned family members
discovered this document in a locker in which the missing Intelligence
officer apparently kept some of his papers. This document as well as others
in his possession may have had some connection with his disappearance,
although exactly what connection this might be, is uncertain.

Copies of this and other documents eventually ended up in the hands of
several researchers as a result of one investigator who was approached by
the family of the missing agent and given the documents. This source stated
that this family was extremely disturbed not only about the disappearance
but also about the nature of the documents themselves and the role they may
have played in connection with the disappearance.

In the copy of the document which is quoted here, some annotations were
made. These seem to have been 'corrections' on various points related in
the ms. made by Paul Bennewitz himself. These corrections will be indicated
by an [*]:



"SUMMARY OF NOTES TAKEN BY JIM MCCAMPBELL CONCERNING... TELEPHONE
INTERVIEWS WITH DR. PAUL F. BENNEWITZ:

"This is Jim McCampbell making a recording of a remarkable episode on July
13, 1984. It has to do with a UFO base, cattle mutilations, advanced
weaponry, contact with aliens, etc.

"The episode began about a week ago when I received a little semi-annual
periodical titled STIGMATA. It is number 21, the First Half of 1984. This
little bulletin is prepared by Thomas Adams at P.O. Box 1994, Paris, TX
75460... (Tom Adams is the ex-husband of Christa Tilton, by the way. -
Branton)

"He has a rather lengthy article. One finds point of interest on page 9 and
I suppose the only way to pursue this is to read what he has here as it is
fundamental to the entire story.

"Quoting: 'In May of 1980 a most interesting event occurred in northern New
Mexico. An event similar in many respects to the Doraty Case. A mother and
her young son were driving on a rural highway near Cimarron, New Mexico.
They observed two or more craft and as Judy Doraty did, they observed a
calf being abducted. Both observers were themselves abducted and taken on
separate craft to what was apparently an underground installation, where
the woman witnessed the mutilation of the calf. [* Woman witnessed
mutilation in the field - dead animal taken with them.] It has been alleged
that she also observed a vat containing unidentified [* cattle] body parts
floating in a liquid, AND ANOTHER VAT CONTAINING THE BODY OF A MALE HUMAN.
The woman was subjected to an examination and it has been further alleged
that small metallic objects were implanted into her body as well as into
her son's body. More than one source has informed us that CAT-scans have
confirmed the presence of these implants.

"'Paul Bennewitz, President of his own scientific company in Albuquerque
and an investigator with the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, has
been the principal investigator of the case. Interviewed in his office in
April 1983, Bennewitz reports that through regressive hypnosis of the
mother and child and his own follow-up investigation [including
communications received via his computer terminal which ostensibly is from
a UFO-related source], he was able to determine the location of the
underground facility, a kilometer underground beneath the Jicarilla Apache
Indian Reservation near Dulce, New Mexico. [Since 1976, one of the areas
hardest-hit by mutilations coincidentally or whatever].

"'...The mother and son, by the way, were returned back to their car that
night. Since the incident, they have suffered repeated trauma and
difficulties as they attempt to recover from the episode. We pass this
along because the account is, of course, most crucial if true; but we are
not in a position to confirm the alleged findings. Hopefully, more
information regarding this incident will be aired in the near future. We
can only consider such reports while continuing to seek the evidence to
refute or confirm.'

"That's the end of this remarkable quotation from STIGMATA.

"...I got in touch with Dr. Bennewitz by telephone and indicated that I had
seen this reference to him and his work and I wanted to find out whether he
was being misrepresented or whatever... It is rather mind boggling and here
is the substance of that telephone conversation.

"He is a physicist and he started four years ago to determine in his own
mind whether UFOs exist or do not and he has gotten much more deeply
involved than he ever intended. IT HAS CAUSED HIM A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
FROM THE GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE GROUPS. He has pictures from the location.
He went with a Highway Patrol Officer and they saw a UFO take off from the
mesa at the location. He obtained photographs and what he calls launch
ships were 330 ft. long and 130 ft. across. The cattle rancher named Gomez
and he went back to this location which is a mesa and saw a surveillance
vehicle which was about 5 ft. by 10 ft., like a satellite, he said. He had
been using a Polaroid camera and then got a Hausel-Bladd to produce much
better pictures. He set up a monitoring station and observed that UFOs are
all over the area... He has been dealing heavily with a Major Edwards
[somebody] [* Security Commander] who was with Manzano Security and two [*
My wife & I] of them saw four objects outside of a [nuclear] warhead
storage area at a range of about 2500 feet and obtained movies of them. He
now has about 6000 feet of movie footage, of which 5000 ft. is in Super
Eight. THE OBJECTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO 'CLOAK,' that's the word, spells
CLOAK like cloak and dagger, like cover up and he says that they can cause
themselves to go invisible by a field that caused the light waves to bend
around the object and that one sees the sky behind them.

"He confirmed the fact that the woman was picked up when she accidentally
observed the calf being abducted. He has paid for a pathology work and
medical doctor work. The pathologist is a former head of the microbiology
department of New Mexico University. They have done CATscans to show that
the woman and her son did in fact have implants in their bodies. [* We
confirmed the woman - not her son] She has a vaginal disease like
streptococci-bulbie[?] and tried many antibodies to destroy the bacteria.
That it has survived off the antibodies themselves. THE ALIENS KEEP
HASSLING HER. [* Still true to date].

"Paul kept the woman and her mother at his house and the UFOs were flying
overhead constantly. THERE IS NO ESP INVOLVED, BUT IT IS JUST PLAIN
PHYSICS.

"They beam down [* They send a beam down - not 'beam down']. They can
communicate THROUGH THIS BEAM. She picked up their transmissions. He
devised a means of communication based upon her alfbic [?] code; one is
equal to 'no' and two being 'yes.' Through this code he has been able to
talk to the aliens. He then computerized a system that would reject
extraneous inputs. HE SAID THAT THEY CAN BE VERY THREATENING AND
MALEVOLENT...

"He then told the O.S.I. OF THE AIR FORCE and he has been requested to give
[* Did give] several presentations to HIGH LEVEL Air Force people in
briefings on the subject, WING LEVEL Command and many others including this
fellow Edwards. And he took a helicopter to the site [* No - Twice to site
- 1st by OSI agent, 2nd by a Col. Carpenter]. It turned out that the WING
COMMANDER, after a presentation that this fellow made, then took a
helicopter to the site and made photographs.

"He says that you can see saucers on the ground. He says there is a kind of
cone - a large cone and the larger vehicles come and land on top of the
cone with the top of the cone fitting into a hole in the bottom. There is
an elevator inside of the cone and that goes down into the mountain or
ground about one kilometer. You can see the aliens running around the base
getting into the vehicles and stuff. They use small vehicles to get around
that have no wheels. They are rectangular in shape and they levitate. They
do not show up in color BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY REFLECTIVE, but in B & W
they are visible. He says that there are beam weapons that are floating in
strategic locations and there is a road into the base. He obtained
infra-red photos of the area from an altitude of 14,000 Ft. There is a
level highway going into the area that is 36 ft. wide. IT IS A GOVERNMENT
ROAD (i.e. part of the off-limits road that goes through Colorado's Ute
Reservation and then south across the border? - Branton). One can see
telemetry trailers and buildings that are five sided buildings with a dome.
It is standard military procedure. There are many guard points and 'stakes'
and there are launch domes that one can see. Next to the launch dome HE SAW
A BLACK LIMOUSINE AND ANOTHER AT SOME DISTANCE OFF [* Apparently]. The
careful measurements showed that the limousine was the same length of his
Lincoln Town car. IT IS A C.I.A. VEHICLE. ALSO THERE WAS A BLUE VAN. He has
been cautioned about these limousines as they will run you off the road if
you try to get into the area and in fact somebody has been killed in that
manner. To the north is a launch site. THERE ARE TWO WRECKED SHIPS THERE:
they are 36 feet with wings, and one can see oxygen and hydrogen tanks.
There are four cylindrical objects Socorro type -- two carrying something
while flying. The whole operation is based upon a government agreement and
a technology trade. We get out of it atomic ships that are operated by
plutonium. The Cash-Landrum case was one of them. The doors jammed open and
neutron radiation came out. They are based at Kirtland AFB and Holloman AFB
[* No - only know of one based at HAFB] and some place in Texas [possibly
Ft. Hood, Texas - a guess only]. He said the government is paying the
hospital bills for the Cash-Landrum victims [* OSI Input - found out later
unless someone covering - not true]. Refueling of the plutonium is
accomplished at Los Alamos. He had... pictures of this base back to 1948
and it has been there starting in 1948. Pictures in 1962, you can see many
saucers and the base and truck... The road was 'passed off' to the local
inhabitants as a lumber contract. He has photographs [* I believe] of the
firing of a beam weapon that [fires?] in two directions. [That would be
necessary on a flying saucer. The reaction forces would impede the vehicle]
He has computed the speeds of [the] flying saucers at 15,000 mph and
indicates that THE PILOTS [* of ours] ARE FROM N.S.A., THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY. The aliens have had atomic propulsion system for 48 years
(or rather one particular 'alien' group, probably native subterranean? -
Branton) and the saucers themselves operate on an electric charge basis
having to do with crystal semiconductor and [* Maybe] a super lattice. I
think he said 'as you increase the voltage, the current goes down.'... At
present there are six to eight vehicles, maybe up to ten over the area and
sometimes up to 100. THEY CAN BE SEEN IN THE CLOUDS. They go into cumulus
clouds and produce nitrogen nitride. [* I assume or speculate it is this]
YOU WILL SEE BLACK SPOTS IN THE CLOUD. They eat holes in the cloud. If you
can see black spots in a cloud, then you can tell that a vehicle is in
there.

"He says that they come from six different cultures and in his
communications (via accessing the information system of the underground
base by tapping-in to their ship-to-base communications frequency using a
radio-computer-video setup he developed. - Branton) [he learned that] SOME
come from a binary system, possibly Zeta Reticuli and from distances up to
and larger than 32 light years away. They also [* appear to] have one to
three [carrier?] ships in earth orbit at 50,000 KM altitude [* Based upon
data]. He had to form the words to try to communicate and he produced a
vocabulary of 627 words in a matrix form and used a computer. The Flying
Saucers [* we see] are limited to operation in the atmosphere.

"Now with regard to the cattle problem, the aliens are using the DNA FROM
CATTLE AND ARE MAKING HUMANOIDS. He got pictures of their video screen.
SOME OF THE CREATURES ARE ANIMAL LIKE, some are near human and some are
human and short with large head (Hu-brids? It would seem that if this is
the case, not all of the so-called 'hybrids' are infused with reptilian
DNA, but rather cattle DNA or a wide variety of other DNA sources available
in the 'Nightmare Hall' level of the base. - Branton). They grow the
embryos. After the embryos become active by a year of training presumably
that is required for them to become operational. When they die, they go
back into the tank. Their parts are recovered.

"In 1979 something happened and the base was closed. There was an argument
over weapons and our people were chased out, more than 100 people involved.
[Someplace later he indicates further details on this point] ... (this
'may' be where the 66 -- 44 figures come from, that is 100 special forces
who were sent in and forced to face literally THOUSANDS of Grays, 66 of
whom fought to their deaths while 44 out of the hundred managed to escape
back to the surface. - Branton)

"The base is 4000 ft. long and our helicopters are going in there all the
time. When it became known that he was familiar with all this, the
mutilations stopped. [* True] They are taking humanoid embryos out of this
base to somewhere else. I asked if it was Albuquerque or Los Alamos, but he
said he didn't know. [Note: 1/8/86 - looks like it is Albuquerque]

(Subterranean bases below Albuquerque? Thomas E. Castello also stated that
much of the Dulce activity was being extended into a MAJOR 'Gray' basing
area below the Los Alamos region. One team of scientists who were
investigating some newly-found ancient pictographs that depicted
'alien-like' scenes in or around the Santa Fe National Forest, insisted
that they had seen in the early morning hours while camping in the area
several dozen discs in the skies over the mountains, and shortly afterwarda
a very large caravan of 'cattle trucks' -- which entered the area and
seemed to leave hours later, after unloading their cargo. This whole
situation seems to 'imply' that the secret government may be 'feeding' the
Grays at Los Alamos, which is apparently the largest 'nest' in North
America outside of other known 'nests' near Madigan - Fort Lewis, WA;
Lakeport-Hopland, Mt. Lassen & Deep Springs, CA; Area 51, NV; Dugway, UT
and the Major NEXUS below DULCE, New Mexico. This may all be part of an
elaborate operation to 'appease' the aliens. The scientists stated that
black helicopters, apparently having spotted their vehicles some distance
away, flew over the area for some time in an effort to locate them, but
apparently could not do so. They said that an almost identical scenario was
repeated the following night and early in the morning. - Branton)

"He said there are still quite a few helicopters in operation. They fly at
night. [* all unmarked] HE WENT UP THERE HIMSELF IN A HELICOPTER AND THE
O.S.I. BRIEFED THE COPTER PILOT AND HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE COPTER PILOT
HIMSELF WAS AN UNDERCOVER MAN. They saw helicopter pads up there - Viet Nam
type, with bearing markers and trees pushed off away from the location. It
is such a wild area he said. He agreed to send me the coordinates of this
base.

"Regarding abductions of people, they pick out medium to low IQ personnel.

(They have also -- according to my information -- attempted to abduct
people with higher-than-normal IQ's, with photographic memory, etc., in
order to either utilize them on an unconscious basis or neutralize their
intellectual capabilities if they appear to be a potential threat. -
Branton)

"They are able to scope out each one [so we can do the same thing with
electro-magnetic spectrum analyzers]. [* I don't know this part - word
mix-up - drop]. They pick up these people and then put implants into them
and then take tissue samples, including ovum from the women, sperm from the
men and DNA.

"THEY CAN PROGRAM THESE PEOPLE AS SLAVES TO DO WHATEVER THEY WISH AND THEY
WILL HAVE NO MEMORY OF IT. THEY [The Hard Core type] STAUNCHLY REFUSE TO BE
X-RAYED OR HYPNOTICALLY REGRESSED. YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR
EYES. HE SAYS 'PECULIAR LOOK IN THE EYES AND A FUNNY SMILE.' [* An
expression] Hynek (that is the late J. Allen Hynek, who worked for the Air
Force's Project Blue Book in the early years and later became a civilian
'Ufologist'. - Branton) knows about all of this and has been in contact
with Coral [Lorenzen]. He regards Hynek as a threat. [* Not really - I just
think he is still a Gov. cover] At his house, he showed Hynek films and out
in the back yard a flying saucer. He asked Hynek about his view with regard
to abductions as to how many people might have been abducted. HYNEK,
UNHESITATINGLY SAID ABOUT ONE

OUT OF FORTY. (Other sources claim that more recent figures indicate this
to be one out of twenty or even one out of ten Americans, since more
abductees are being taken and implanted as time goes on -- most of whom are
consciously unaware of the process because of hypno-electro-chemical memory
suppression! - Branton)

"He said that many people come to his door to see him, just 'out of the
blue' and he sees SCARS on the back of their necks. That previous old scars
are easy to detect and that new ones are hard to detect. HE FEELS THAT THIS
IS A SICKENING SITUATION.

"THE ALIENS HAVE GONE WILD AND USE HYPODERMICS [and notes a 'parallel four
times.'] [McCampbell: I don't know what that means] [* I don't know
either]. He has been paralyzed four times and has been hit 250 times by
hypodermics. He says they knock you cold and they do whatever they want to
do and the above points have been verified medically.

"A man came to see him with a top secret document that was dated in the
50's, indicating if anybody found out about all of this they would kill
them. He was asked 'doesn't that bother you?' He said 'no it didn't.'

"He said he had sent some film to Kodak and there were seven rolls. They
were Ectachrome G which could not be processed locally, so they had to go
to Kodak. He does all of the film work commercially so that nobody could
claim that he had 'monkeyed' with the film. His films came back, but one of
them -- one was plain Ectachrome, but [* Was missing for 2 months - when
received] nine feet was missing and this was close-ups of UFOs that he had
taken. The missing pictures of the nine feet [* The 9 ft. didn't - others
known only to me did] IN A TOP SECRET DOCUMENT THAT HE STUDIED AND THE CODE
NAME IS AQUARIUS AND IT IS A PROJECT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY [* I
was told NASA]. They are the ones that kept his film and copied it with
deletions on Ectrochrome and sent it back [* I suspect].

"THERE HAVE BEEN INDIRECT THREATS BY THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE AGAINST
HIM.

"THE LOCATION OF THE BASE IS 2 1/2 MILES NORTH-WEST OF DULCE AND ALMOST
OVERLOOKS THE TOWN. IT IS UP ON THE MESA. We discussed the similarity
between everything we have been talking about here and the movie 'CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND'. He said he speculated that seemed to be a
plan of disclosure, that is the movie. The coordinates of the location are
not far off and the mountain where the actual base is looks much like the
mountain in the movie.

"The next thing was -- Discussing the trade off -- all right. Here is what
we got in the trade off. We got atomic technology, the atomic flying ships.
Several of them, the first one wrecked on the ground and it can be seen and
photographed from the air. A second one wrecked. A third one was wrecked.
Apparently this last one was repaired and was the one that was in Houston
-- near Houston in the Cash-Landrum case. The second items that we get out
of it, are the beam weapons, the beam technology and third [* I speculate]
is the thought [psionic] beam. That is the means by which communication is
accomplished. It is electrostatic in character with a magnetic component [*
artifact] and it is the only way of communicating with people. They have to
have the implants in order to use it. The crash occurred at the base WHEN
THERE WAS A DISTURBANCE OF SOME SORT, THE ALIENS KILLED 66 OF OUR PEOPLE
AND 44 GOT AWAY. [* Alien computer input - True? I do not know.]. Over an
argument -- they turned on us.

"...He was familiar with what the aliens called MPS, which means
manipulations per second -- no, manipulations per sequence. [An]
electrostatic field that can be manipulated into many configurations and
the craft can stall. In order to prevent this, the field is adjusted once
every forty milliseconds. He studied the trails from UFOs and they seem to
break down into a pulse rate of 62 per second. Based upon the color movie
pictures, there seems to be a blast of light and spectral components and
composition in there, with a Bow-Wave in front of the UFO with nitrogen
showing green and oxygen showing blue, but with the saucer being invisible.
They can run into a car or airplane and this Bow-Wave will destroy them.
Rockets can hit this Bow-Wave and be destroyed. They can't penetrate it. At
White Sands he was shown pictures of an F-15 shooting rockets with a
missile at a target and the saucers came in behind the missile, 30 ft.
behind, and then flew through the explosion. He didn't know what the
purpose of the demonstration was, but suspected it might be just to show
how invulnerable they are. But sometimes the saucers get into trouble and
they are all consumed in some kind of way.

"When he went up to Dulce in a helicopter, they landed and left some
equipment there, but then when they came back the pilot was extremely
nervous. Paul wanted to land on the base, but the pilot wouldn't do that.
They came back to Dulce and landed at a small strip there, where they found
two large Huey helicopters. The Indian [* Highway Patrolman] in charge
there named Valdez went aboard one of the choppers AND THEY FOUND THEM TO
BE FULL OF COMMANDOS. THEY ESTIMATED A TOTAL OF 75 COMMANDOS, fully armed
with M-1 rifles [* No - M16's] and rockets [* & launchers].

"They did not have any indication of rank [* Valdez says no - not true - my
mistake - I did not get that all]. They only HAD shoulder patches on and
the helicopters had no identification other than numbers. The helicopters
were part of a project called BLUE LIGHT and they were from Ft. Carson,
Colorado [* OSI Input]. When they left they were escorted by these two
large Huey helicopters. As they were flying along, in the background they
saw rise up one of the advanced space technology vehicles that looked like
a manta ray with a negative dihedral and projections coming down. It flew
vertically past [the] two accompanying helicopters. PAUL FEELS THAT IT IS
IMPERATIVE THAT THIS INFORMATION BE RELEASED BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT IT IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
THAT INVADES THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS BY THE IMPLANTATION'S. HE SAID
THAT 'ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH BY THE ALIENS, THEY ARE NEVER THE
SAME.' [I suppose one can easily believe that.] [Jim McCampbell comments]
So it appears that, for the privilege of collecting the biological
materials in the mutilation of cattle and the abductions and the operations
on board the craft, the government has allowed this to go on and even to
assist for the privilege of getting the nuclear flight technology, plus
also the embryos which are flown out of the base. [A rather fantastic
story] [Jim McCampbell comment] Paul strikes me as being an extremely
conservative, extremely knowledgeable and reliable scientist, who was
intimately familiar with sophisticated laboratory equipment. His is
thoroughly scientific and reliable. [Jim McCampbell evaluation]

"...I inquired about the other bases that were referred to in the
'STIGMATA' report or article. He said all that he knew [was] that one was
to the south, one to the west and one to the east and he doesn't want to
know anything more about it. (That is, in addition to the base north of
town, there were other connected facilities west, south and east of town.
In fact some sources have claimed that level 1 of the Dulce base reaches
under the town of Dulce itself at a depth of some 200 to 300 feet. -
Branton)

"I discussed the prospect of using the paper in the MUFON Proceedings to
try to find the center of gravity for the mutilation cases from those maps
that run from about 1972 to 1982 or 1983. The word gravity triggered in his
mind another connection having to do with the Dept. of Interior that has a
gravity dept. and they do in fact survey the United States and publish maps
indicating the gravity contours. THERE IS A VERY WEAK GRAVITY at the site
near Dulce. (Also another very weak gravity reading exists around Creede,
Colorado, which is reportedly a northern extension from the Dulce facility.
There are also southeast extensions as far away as Roswell and Carlsbad,
New Mexico and an apparent southwest extension that seems to reach as far
as the Superstition Mts. east of Phoenix, Arizona. These 'extensions' are
not necessarily all base-complexes, but tunnels that have been excavated by
aliens, secret government OR ancient cultures -- or all of the above -- via
nuclear drills which eliminate waste matter by melting and cracking the
rock, and pushing the molten rock as the machine moves forward into the
peripheral cracks of the tunnel, where the incandescent rock cools into a
super-hard glazed and water-tight lining. - Branton) He said that the craft
are very sensitive to the gravity levels and SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THE
OTHER SITES MIGHT ALSO BE LOCATED RELATIVE TO WEAK GRAVITY.

"He indicated that the objects fly in a wobbly way. His pictures have shown
that. He says 'like the rocking of a boat.' He has measured many right
angle turns and also full 180 degree turns in a 20th of a second with the
objects still inside the bow-wave. He has also observed and photographed
the object or lights moving in a triangular pattern and square patterns. HE
SAYS HIGH POWERED RADAR CAN INTERFERE WITH THEM. I reported on the meeting
that we had on Sunday afternoon and raised some of the questions that came
out of that meeting. One of them was why not remove the implant? He said
that this had been discussed and the lady witness finds that acceptable if
she can be assured that there can be no nerve damage. He then went into
great detail, which exceeds my knowledge of anatomy, in describing the
location of the implants. ONE APPEARS TO BE ADJACENT TO AND EXTERNAL TO THE
CORTEX, WHICH I THINK HE INDICATED WAS AT THE BASE OF THE BRAIN. The image
of the CATscan is of a very small helix, like it was joining two major
nerves near the spinal column. Then on the lateral right side from the
back, there is an implant of perhaps like the one above. Another is on the
left side. Two others are on the forward part of the skull, which appear to
be small 2 millimeter electrodes AGAINST THE RADIAL NERVE. There is a shape
to these things which he indicated is like a baby bottle nipple upside down
[* This shape is not the implants which **ILLEGIBLE** the skull], not the
cap part, but just the nipple itself. [I raised the question of the
U.S.S.R. satellites seeing this Base] He acknowledged that and also that
ours can certainly see it. He had a discussion with some photo analyst [*
OSI photo analyst] who indicated that he had seen tracks up a hill and a
launch location that was definitely not a rock but some kind of artificial
construction. On the hazard of entering [the] area, I asked about that. He
said that there is a risk if we went in on foot, but if a person tried to
do that likely that the people would 'wack them.' [* I said 'zap'. The odds
are one might be accosted] But he thinks that a helicopter would be safe.
But what he wants to do is to do additional aerial surveillance. Then go in
with a group, the larger number of people the better. A Highway Patrolman,
a friend of his, is ready to go in at any time. He says one can't act on
impulse. You have to plan out a program. He said four times he had near
encounters and one was with this Major Edwards. He had received a mental
communication [* No - not received - I asked them mentally - they were
apparently scanning me - I don't 'receive' anything mentally.] while
watching some UFOs...

"He is president of Thunder Scientific Corporation, a well known operation
there, with their specialty being temperature and humidity devices. THEIR
EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ON THE SHUTTLE AND MOST OF THEIR BUSINESS IS WITH THE
TOP

500 CORPORATIONS.

"His company is by Sandia on 1/2 acres and [he is] now building an
additional 3500 sq. ft. building. There is another organization called
Bennewitz Laboratory which is the research arm of Thunder Scientific
Corporation owned 90% by the latter and operated by his three sons. They
have invented a hearing device that has no moving parts that makes totally
deaf people able to hear and in addition, expanding the frequency range
plus 100 HZ on the high side and down to less than 10 HZ on the low
frequency end.

"He said that he got involved in all this merely as a hobby and it became
an obsession. He simply wanted to know what was going on and to develop
instrumentation to measure data, etc. Since THE SIGNALS FROM THE UFOS ARE
VERY LOW FREQUENCY, DOWN AROUND 200 [?] HZ and with an analyzer you just
think you are looking at some noise. But I believe he said IT WAS A MEMORY
SCOPE THAT WAS ABLE TO FILTER OUT THE SIGNALS INVOLVED THERE WHEREAS
ORDINARY FILTERS DO NOT. They trigger signals in an on and off fashion,
instead of O and 1 volt representing that type of communication or signal,
a distinction is made between a narrow pulse and wide pulse. Each
communication is preceded by four or five pulses. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN
TOUCH WITH THE O.S.I. which has been verified by [the book] 'CLEAR INTENT.'
But NOW HE SAYS THAT WHEN HE CALLS THEM, THEY WON'T SPEAK TO HIM SO HE IS
IN A 'SHUT OUT' SITUATION. I pointed out that there were two O.S.I.'s
[Office of Special Investigation] and the other is C.I.A. [Office of
Scientific Investigation]. He assured me that is was not the C.I.A. group.
He said the actual title of the group that he was dealing with was the
'Office of Secret Investigation' [or 'Intelligence']. He says there is also
a new pattern or [ILLEGIBLE] called Human Intelligence, that is they
investigate the humans, that is, the government. I mentioned to him that in
'CLEAR INTENT' that it said he was under surveillance. That happens to be
in error. That information comes from SOMEWHERE ELSE. But he quickly said
'I know that I am under surveillance.' They set up a site across the street
from his house with computers and recorders. A girl rented the house. He
had a detective look into this and found that she was operating under an
assumed name and SHE HAD NO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. HE HAS PHOTOGRAPHS OF
PEOPLE COMING AND GOING WITH 'NORAD' LICENSE PLATES, AIR FORCE, A.F.
WEAPONS LAB. HE THINKS N.S.A. IS ORCHESTRATING THIS. For an entirely
separate subject, he thinks [* I was told that it was by a Washington
source] this whole operation, THE UFO BASE DETAIL IS CLASSIFIED HIGHER THAN
THE PRESIDENT. THAT IS, HE THINKS THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS
[Not in total depth] [* True].

"He is also concerned that there are two levels of security involved. (1)
Project AQUARIUS which is TOP SECRET and another (2) higher than that;
where people in charge of the higher level information HAVING THESE NEW
VEHICLES COULD SIMPLY TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT. He called the Air Force
intelligence headquarters in [Washington] [* Yes - true - AF Intel.] [He
didn't say Washington, but that was the idea] The Commanding Officer was
not present but he talked to a Captain who was the adjutant or executive
and started talking. He said 'I know all of these facts, and this and that
and what do you think about that?' The Captain said 'JUST WRITE US A REPORT
AND TELL US WHAT WE SHOULD DO.' [* About it] So he prepared a 20 page
report and Edwards saw it. He forwarded it by Federal Express and also a
copy to the White House in a double envelope, indicating that sensitive
material was in the inner envelope. Edwards got a call from Colonel Smith
[* Not Smith - Col. Don ____? Have to check files.] who was the White House
Liaison to inquire who this Bennewitz fellow was. Edwards gave a positive
report. The White House was extremely interested and issued orders 'TO GET
ON WITH IT; TO DO SOMETHING, ASSURING EDWARDS THAT BENNEWITZ WOULD RECEIVE
A LETTER WITHIN TWO WEEKS.'

(Note: This tends to confirm that TWO groups, both elected and unelected,
are working simultaneously within 'government', and that each seems to have
different agendas in regards to how 'government' should be run, how the
alien problem should be dealt with, and how other issues should be handled.
Only a small percentage of the White House executive branch and probably
even a smaller percent of the Senate, House of Representatives and Congress
know what is going on in regards to the 'joint-interaction' projects. The
Executive branch apparently knows more than the other governmental branches
because of its close ties with the Military-Intelligence-Industrial complex
and because of the large number of 'appointed' rather than 'elected'
officials operating within... that is, within the 'Executive' secret
agencies that have been created to operate outside of presidential
awareness for purposes of "plausible deniability" and which have come under
the control of the Industrial elite rather than the elected Congress. One
of the reasons why the Congress and the electorate government has lost so
much control over the country to the Industrial elite is because they have
capitulated this authority over to the President and executive branch of
government, when the President according to the U.S. Constitution should
serve merely as the spokesman for the Congress, Senate, and House of
Representatives. We have unconstitutionally allowed the President to have
the power to appoint his own UNELECTED staff, establish Executive Orders
without the consent of Congress, and create agencies that are free from
Congressional oversight. For instance Congressional overseers and
investigators have been allowed to hold only a TOP SECRET security
clearance, whereas many of these secret agencies like MJ12 that were
created by the executive branch are classified ABOVE TOP SECRET or higher,
in other words they are unelected "secret governments" operating like
tape-worms within the elected government, with the potential of corrupting
it from within as exemplified by the numerous black projects taking place
within the Dulce base, and elsewhere. The activities being carried out
within the Dulce base have gone "out of control", and all manner of
unregulated atrocities are being carried out there simply because THERE IS
NO CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THOSE ACTIVITIES. Now that the cloning of
large animals such as lambs and monkeys is a PUBLICLY KNOWN FACT, we cannot
ignore the many claims of sophisticated and unregulated cybernetic and
biogenetic atrocities that have reportedly been taking place within these
bases for decades. I should know, since I myself am the product of such
cybernetic-biogenetic tampering -- although you might say a 'renegade'
product of such black budget projects, and one who they "lost control of"
along with whatever sensitive data/secrets my unconscious mind may have
harbored at the time of my "defection". In regards to the problems
threatening our Constitutional government, giving a U.S. President the
power to create agencies which can operate with impunity far from the
prying eyes of Congress and the citizens of the U.S.A. is dangerous in the
extreme. This is especially true when we consider the risk that a potential
President may be the hireling of powerful corporate interests with strong
media ties, and therefore able to bend public opinion in favor of the
candidate of their choice while discrediting the opposition. History has
shown that powerful corporate entities are more interested in making a
profit -- even if it means selling out the rest of us -- than in
maintaining liberty and equality. Many of the corporate 'empires' involved
with the secret government hold to the Constitution only to the degree that
it serves their own self-interest. This has led America dangerously close
to the edge that separates a Congressionally run DEMOCRACY from what we
might refer to as a Corporate run MONARCHY, one that is ultimately
controlled by unelected corporate interests rather than by elected members
of Congress, the Senate, and House of Representatives. - Branton)

"Such a letter was never received. Finally, Col. Smith from the Air Force
Secretary sent him a letter eventually just pursuing the 'old party line.'
That said 'he should not be troubling the headquarters of the Air Force and
the Executive offices of the White House with all of his stuff.'

(As a result of this and other 'pressure' which came from elsewhere in the
Intelligence community, nothing immediately came about, and certainly no
'Congressional Investigation' into the activities near Dulce, which was
definitely warranted. The 'pressure' may have come from the
NSA-CIA-AQUARIUS-MAJI agencies. It seems as if the alleged intelligence
agent "Ufologist" William Moore played a major role in the efforts to
sabotage the Dulce investigations and destroy Paul Bennewitz' reputation.
Moore was working on behalf of the 'AVIARY' -- a schizophrenic 'Alien
Intelligence' Agency operating deep within the murky labyrinthine levels of
the 'governmental-military-industrial' complex, an agency which is
apparently carrying out the policies and agendas of the likewise
schizophrenic MJ12 organization, or the policies of MJ12's superior agency
MAJI -- the 'Majestic Agency for Joint Intelligence'. Depending on which
'faction' has gained the upper hand in MJ12, in the CIA, and in the AVIARY
-- that is the NAVY's pro American CABAL and COM-12 agencies OR the NAZI's
[er, I mean the NSA's] pro New World Order MAJI and AQUARIUS agencies --
the policies of these agencies have in the past been subject to immediate
change if not absolute reversal. As a case in point, Cattle Mutilation
researcher Linda Moulton Howe was invited to Kirtland AFB in April of 1983
to visit with AFOSI agent Richard Doty. During the visit Doty showed Howe
some extremely sensitive documents PROVING the existence of aliens and
alien hardware now in government hands. Doty detailed a complex plan for
metered public release of the entire UFO secret, and was interested in
using Ms. Howe's contract with HBO -- to do a UFO / Cattle Mutilation
documentary -- as a springboard for the release of such information.
Elaborate plans were made and many promises were given, however as a result
of a power-struggle deep within the Intelligence community the plans for
public information release were shelved and Linda Howe was left out in the
cold scratching her head and wondering just what the hell the whole thing
was all about. And Linda Howe has NOT been the only one to experience this
bizarre type of schizophrenic activity within the Intelligence community,
especially in regards to projects and plans for the 'government' to come
clean on the alien agenda. Apparently there are those patriots within
government who want ALL of the facts about alien malevolence and
infiltration of planet earth made public; those corporate interests who
want NONE of the facts made public as they maintain their power through the
suppression of truth; and those agents of the aliens themselves who want
information made public SO LONG as the alien Greys are presented as
benevolent 'space brothers'... I would guess the latter would involve some
type of propoganda meant to entice the massess themselves to accept and
capitulate their will over to the Draconian Reptiloid/Grey collectivists,
who have infiltrated and control certain levels of the
military-intelligence-industrial complex. - Branton)

"Bennewitz showed this letter to Edwards WHO BLEW UP AND CALLED SMITH [*
Col. Don. ____]. They got an answer from the Air Force that they were not
interested and knew nothing about it. On another point: referencing the
'STIGMATA' article where the farmer thought that the two humanoids may have
been naked. In the case with which he was dealing with -- the woman and the
son, the boy upon being questioned laughed, and said 'they had no fronts or
behinds.' I asked no sexual organs?, and he said yes, no organs at all. He
has received information concerning a high metabolism rate of the
creatures, even birdlike. One of the witnesses, I think the woman who was
being taken by the hand, said the hand of the creature was 'red hot.' And
he guesses that it must have been 115 degrees F. The creatures cannot stand
uncontrolled environment. THEY WEAR SUITS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST EXCESSIVE
HEAT. They are fed by a formula and if they are short of that intake, they
will turn green. [* Turn Grey - They are a light yellow green when healthy]
The heart is on the right side and they have one lung. Elimination is
through the skin. The creatures are very strong...

"He says that the UFOs can be detected by radar detectors and they also
trigger highway patrol radar or Police radar guns. His friend Valdez, at
his suggestion, was looking for water intake to the site and within about 1
1/2 miles he came upon a flying saucer at a distance of about 300 ft. THE
INDIANS OWN THE AREA -- ARE QUITE SCARED AND VERY SUPERSTITIOUS AND 90% OF
THEM HAVE MOVED INTO TOWN. The Chief of Police told him about an experience
he had. A tribal chief had gone deer hunting on a mesa south of Dulce. Two
days went by. When he didn't return, a search party was sent out. In the
daylight on the mesa, a ship 'hopped up' from down below and came above the
mesa. The guys [human] kicked the tribal chief to the ground. Then they got
into the ship and disappeared. He had been hunting and had 'fell'. He had a
broken leg and he was picked up by these people in the craft. They were
blacks... [* No - No - the SHIP was black... black uniforms] He discussed
something about some devices called sphericals that are optical in sound [*
They have a sound when they move abruptly.] and apparently remotely
controlled little vehicles... Spheres from 1 1/2" to 12" in diameter.
(These hovering spheres have also been seen in underground bases that reach
as deeply as 2 miles below Edwards Air Force Base in California. Some have
referred to them as 'spybees' - Branton). We discussed weapons used by
aliens and whether or not they are used to paralyze people. Yes, they
consist of a cube about 2" on a side -- called a lens hung around the neck
that emits a beam. Another on the ship produces a BLUE light that he has
seen. It comes from a device about 4" high and 14" long with grid black
lines on it (Note: Is Bennewitz an abductee also? - Branton). The color
produced is very light blue which is like ionized oxygen. He has not sought
publicity on any of this. He is only interested in getting the facts...

"I continue to get reassurance that the guy is continually on the level and
what he has to say should be taken seriously... [Jim McCampbell comment.]"



Ufologist Penny Harper, in the January 1990 issue of 'WHOLE LIFE TIMES',
adds an unusual postscript to the Bennewitz affair in an article in which
she revealed the following:



"Paul Bennewitz -- whereabouts unknown. Paul was a scientist investigating
an abduction case. A woman and her son drove down a road in the southwest,
the woman witnessed aliens mutilating a calf. The aliens captured both
mother and son, taking them into an underground installation."

The woman observed many frightening things, apparently much of it similar
to what abductee Christa Tilton and others have witnessed, yet they -
mother and son - also saw:

"...human body parts floating in a vat of amber liquid. After a horrifying
ordeal, the woman and her son were taken back to their car. Bennewitz was
able to determine that there is a secret 'alien' base beneath Dulce, New
Mexico. He wrote 'The Dulce Report' and sent it to the civilian UFO group
called APRO [i.e. Aerial Phenomena Research Organization]. Bennewitz was
then committed to the New Mexico State Hospital for the mentally ill where
he was given electro-shock 'therapy.' When he was discharged, he publicly
stated that he would not have anything to do with UFOs. He is a recluse
today, but still alive, last I heard."
