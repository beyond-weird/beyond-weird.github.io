 [PART 13]

Bush and Draper

Twenty years before he was U.S. President, George Bush brought two
"race-science" professors in front of the Republican Task Force on
Earth Resources and Population. As chairman of the Task Force,
then-Congressman Bush invited Professors William Shockley and Arthur
Jensen to explain to the committee how allegedly runaway birth-rates
for African-Americans were "down-breeding" the American population.

Afterwards, Bush personally summed up for the Congress the testimony
his black-inferiority advocates had given to the Task Force. Note #2. 
George Bush held his hearings on the threat posed by black babies 
on August 5, 1969, while much of the world was in a better frame of mind 
-- celebrating mankind's progress from the first moon landing 16 days 
earlier. Bush's obsessive thinking on this subject was guided by his 
family's friend, Gen. William H. Draper, Jr., the founder and chairman 
of the Population Crisis Committee, and vice chairman of the PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD FEDERATION. Draper had long been steering U.S. 
public discussion about the so-called "population bomb" in the non-
white areas of the world. [Nothing was said about 'over-population' by
the 'white' races.  Obviously 'they' consider the 'Caucasian', 'Anglo' or
'Aryan' races to be far superior to the darker races. - Wol.]

If Congressman Bush had explained to his colleagues "how his family
had come to know General Draper," they would perhaps have felt
some alarm, or even panic, and paid more healthy attention to Bush's
presentation. Unfortunately, the Draper-Bush population doctrine is
now official U.S. foreign policy.

William H. Draper, Jr. had joined the Bush team in 1927, when he was
hired by Dillon Read & Co., New York investment bankers. Draper was
put into a new job slot at the firm: handling the Thyssen account.

We recall that in 1924, Fritz Thyssen set up his Union Banking
Corporation in George Herbert Walker's bank at 39 Broadway, Manhattan.
DILLON READ & CO.'s boss, Clarence Dillon, had begun working with
Fritz Thyssen some time after Averell Harriman first met with Thyssen
-- at about the time Thyssen began financing Adolf Hitler's political
career.

In January 1926, Dillon Read created the "German Credit and Invest-
ment Corporation" in NEWARK, New Jersey and BERLIN, Germany, as 
Thyssen's short-term banker. That same year, Dillon Read created the 
"Vereinigte Stahlwerke" (German Steel Trust), incorporating the Thyssen 
family interests under the direction of New York and London finance. 
Note #2. Note #3

William H. Draper, Jr. was made director, vice president, and
assistant treasurer of the German Credit and Investment Corp. His
business was short-term loans and financial management tricks for
Thyssen and the German Steel Trust. Draper's clients sponsored
Hitler's terroristic takeover; his clients led the buildup of the Nazi
war industry; his clients made war against the United States. The
Nazis were Draper's direct partners in BERLIN and NEW JERSEY:
Alexander Kreuter, residing in Berlin, was president; Frederic Brandi,
whose father was a top coal executive in the German Steel Trust,
moved to the United States in 1926 and served as Draper's co-
director in NEWARK.

Draper's role was crucial for Dillon Read & Co., for whom Draper
was a partner and eventually vice president. The GERMAN CREDIT
AND INVESTMENT CORP. (GCI) was a "front" for Dillon Read: It had 
the same New Jersey address as U.S. & INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES
CORP. (USIS), and the same man served as treasurer of both firms. 
Note #2. Note #4

Clarence Dillon and his son C. Douglas Dillon were directors of USIS,
which was spotlighted when Clarence Dillon was hauled before the
Senate Banking Committee's famous "Pecora" hearings in 1933. USIS
was shown to be one of the great speculative pyramid schemes which
had swindled stockholders of hundreds of millions of dollars. These
investment policies had rotted the U.S. economy to the core, and LED
to the Great Depression of the 1930s.

But William H. Draper, Jr.'s GCI "front" was not "apparently" affiliated
with the USIS "front" or with Dillon, and the GCI escaped the congress-
men's limited scrutiny. This oversight was to prove most unfortunate,
particularly to the 50 MILLION people who subsequently died in World
War II.

Dillon Read hired public relations man Ivy Lee to prepare their
executives for their testimony and to confuse and further baffle the
congressmen. Note #2. Note #5. Lee apparently took enough time out
from his duties as image-maker for William S. Farish and the Nazi
I.G. Farben Co.; he managed the congressional thinking so that the
congressmen did not disturb the Draper operation in Germany -- and
did not meddle with Thyssen, or interfere with Hitler's U.S. moneymen.

Thus, in 1932, Willam H. Draper, Jr. was free to finance the International
Eugenics Congress as a "Supporting Member." Note #2. Note #6. Was
he using his own income as a Thyssen trust banker? Or did the funds
come from Dillon Read corporate accounts, perhaps to be written
off income tax as "expenses for German project: race purification"?
Draper helped select Ernst Rudin as chief of the world eugenics
movement, who used his office to promote what he called Adolf Hitler's
"holy, national and international racial hygienic mission." Note #2.
Note #7

W.S. Farish was publicly exposed in 1942, humiliated and destroyed.
Just before Farish died, Prescott Bush's Nazi banking office was
quietly seized and shut down. But Prescott's close friend and partner
in the Thyssen-Hitler business, William H. Draper, Jr., "neither died
nor moved out of German affairs." Draper listed himself as a director
of the German Credit and Investment Corp. through 1942, and the firm
was not liquidated until November 1943. Note #2. Note #8. But a war
was on. Draper, a colonel from previous military service, went off to 
the Pacific theater and became a general.

General Draper apparently had a hobby: magic -- illusions, sleight of
hand, etc. -- and he was a member of the Society of American Magi-
cians. This is not irrelevant to his subsequent career.

The Nazi regime 'surrendered' in May 1945. In July 1945, General
Draper was called to Europe by the American military government
authorities in Germany. Draper was appointed head of the Economics
Division of the U.S. Control Commission. He was assigned to take
apart the Nazi corporate cartels. There is an astonishing but perfectly
logical rationale to this -- Draper knew a lot about the subject! General
Draper, who had spent about 15 years financing and managing the
dirtiest of the Nazi enterprises, was now authorized to decide "who
was exposed, who lost and who kept his business, and in practical
effect, who was prosecuted for war crimes." Note #2. Note #9.

(Draper was not unique within the postwar occupation government.
Consider the case of John J. McCloy, U.S. Military Governor and High
Commissioner of Germany, 1949-1952. Under instructions from his
Wall Street law firm, McCloy had lived for a year in Italy, serving as
an adviser to the fascist government of Benito Mussolini. An intimate
collaborator of the Harriman/Bush bank, McCloy had sat in Adolf
Hitler's box at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, at the invitation of
Nazi chieftains Rudolf Hess and Hermann Goering.) Note #3 Note #0

William H. Draper, Jr., as a "conservative," was paired with the
"liberal" U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau in a vicious game.
Morgenthau demanded that Germany be utterly DESTROYED as a 
nation, that its industry be dismantled and it be reduced to a purely 
rural country. As the economic boss in 1945 and 1946, Draper "PRO-
TECTED" Germany from the Morgenthau Plan ... but at a price.

Draper and his colleagues demanded that Germany and the world
accept the "collective guilt of the German people" as "the "explanation
for the rise of Hitler's New Order, and the Nazi war crimes. This, of
course, was rather convenient for General Draper himself, as it was
for the Bush family. It is still convenient decades later, allowing
Prescott's son, President Bush, to lecture Germany on the danger 
of Hitlerism. Germans are too slow, it seems, to accept his New 
World Order.

After several years of government service (often working directly
for Averell Harriman in the North Atlantic Alliance), Draper was
appointed in 1958 chairman of a committee which was to advise
President Dwight Eisenhower on the proper course for U.S. military
to other countries. At that time, Prescott Bush was a U.S. senator
from Connecticut, a confidential friend and golf partner with National
Security Director Gordon Gray, and an important golf partner with
Dwight Eisenhower as well. Prescott's old lawyer from the Nazi days,
John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State, and his brother Allen
Dulles, formerly of the Schroder bank, was head of the CIA.

This friendly environment emboldened our General Draper to pull off a
stunt with his military aid advisery committee. He changed the subject
under study. The following year, the Draper committee recommended
that the U.S. government react to the supposed threat of the "population
explosion" by formulating plans to depopulate the poorer countries.  
[Diverting attention from Nazi atrocities and to the "need" for government
to implement Nazi-like racist "de-population" measures is ironic in the 
extreme. - Wol.] The growth of the world's non-white population, he 
proposed, should be regarded as dangerous to the national security of 
the United States! Note #3. Note #1.

President Eisenhower rejected the recommendation. But in the next
decade, General Draper founded the "Population Crisis Committee"
and the "Draper Fund," joining with the ROCKEFELLER and DUPONT 
families to promote eugenics as "population control." The administration 
of President Lyndon Johnson [who took over after the murder of John F.
Kennedy. - Wol.], advised by Draper on the subject, began FINANCING 
birth control in the tropical countries through the Agency for International 
Development.

General William Draper was George Bush's guru on the population
question. Note #3. Note #2. But there was also Draper's money -- 
from that uniquely horrible source -- and Draper's connections on Wall
Street and abroad. Draper's son and heir, William H. Draper III, was
co-chairman for finance (chief of fundraising) of the Bush-for-President
national campaign organization in 1980. With George Bush in the
White House, the younger Draper heads up the depopulation activities
of the UNITED NATIONS throughout the world.

Draper was vice president of Dillon Read until 1953. During the 1950s
and 1960s, the chief executive there was Frederic Brandi, the German
who was Draper's co-director for the Nazi investments and his personal
contact man with the Nazi Steel Trust. Nicholas Brady was Brandi's
partner from 1954, and replaced him as the firm's chief executive in
1971. Nicholas Brady, who knows where all the bodies are buried, was
chairman of his friend George Bush's 1980 election campaign in New
Jersey, and has been United States Treasury Secretary throughout
Bush's presidency. Note #3. Note #3.

Bush and Grey

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) says that
surgical sterilization is the Bush administration's "first choice"
method of population reduction in the Third World. Note #3. Note #4.

The United Nations Population Fund claims that 37 percent of
contraception users in Ibero-America and the Caribbean have already
been surgically sterilized. In a 1991 report, William H. Draper III's
U.N. agency asserts that 254 million couples will be surgically
sterilized over the course of the 1990s; and that if present trends
continue, 80 percent of the women in Puerto Rico and Panama will
be surgically sterilized. Note #3. Note #5.

The U.S. government pays directly for these sterilizations.

Mexico is first among targeted nations, on a list which was drawn 
up in July 1991, at a USAID strategy session. India and Brazil are
second and third priorities, respectively.

On contract with the Bush administration, U.S. personnel are working
from bases in Mexico to perform surgery on millions of Mexican men
and women. The acknowledged strategy in this program is to sterilize
those young adults who have not already completed their families...

George Bush has a rather deep-seated personal feeling about this
project, in particular as it pits him against Pope John Paul II in
Catholic countries such as Mexico...

The spending for birth control in the non-white countries is one of
the few items that is headed upwards in the Bush administration
budget. As its 1992 budget was being set, USAID said its Population
Account would receive $300 million, a 20 percent increase over the
previous year. Within this project, a significant sum is spent on
political and psychological manipulations of target nations, and
rather blatant subversion of their religions and governments. Note #3.
Note #6.

These activities might be expected to cause serious objections from
the victimized nationalities, or from U.S. taxpayers, especially if
the program is somehow given widespread publicity.

Quite aside from moral considerations, "legal" questions would
naturally arise, which could be summed up: "How does George Bush
think he can get away with this?"

In this matter the President has expert advice. Mr. (Clayland) Boyden
Gray has been counsel to George Bush since the 1980 election. As chief
legal officer in the White House, Boyden Gray can walk the President
through the dangers and complexities of waging such unusual warfare
against Third World populations. Gray knows how these things are done.

When Boyden Gray was four and five years old, his father organized the
pilot project for the present worldwide sterilization program, from the
Gray family household in North Carolina.

It started in 1946. The eugenics movement was looking for a way to
begin again in America.

Nazi death camps such as Auschwitz had just then seared the con-
science of the world. The Sterilization League of America, which had
changed its name during the war to "Birthright, Inc.," wanted to start
up again. First they had to overcome public nervousness about crack-
pots proposing to eliminate "inferior" and "defective" people [which is
exactly what "Planned Parenthood", etc., wanted to do.  There is a
world of difference between generalized 'birth control' and the elimina-
tion of "undesirable" races, especially through genocide. - Wol.]. The
League tried to surface in Iowa, but had to back off because of negative
publicity: a little boy had recently been sterilized there and had died
from the operation.

They decided on North Carolina, where the Gray family could play
the perfect host. Note #3. Note #7. Through British imperial contacts,
Boyden Gray's grandfather Bowman Gray had become principal owner
of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Boyden's father, Gordon Gray, had
recently founded the Bowman Gray (memorial) Medical School in
Winston-Salem, using his inherited cigarette stock shares. The medical
school was already a eugenics center.

As the experiment began, Gordon Gray's great aunt, Alice Shelton Gray,
who had raised him from childhood, was living in his household. Aunt
Alice had founded the "Human Betterment League," the North Carolina
branch of the national eugenical sterilization movement.

Aunt Alice was the official supervisor of the 1946-47 experiment.
Working under Miss Gray was Dr. Claude Nash Herndon, whom Gordon
Gray had made assistant professor of "medical genetics" at Bowman
Gray medical school.

Dr. Clarence GAMBLE, heir to the PROCTOR AND GAMBLE soap 
fortune, was the sterilizers' national field operations chief.

The experiment worked as follows. "All children enrolled in the school
district of Winston-Salem, N.C., were given a special "intelligence
test." Those children who scored below a certain arbitrary low mark
were then cut open and "surgically sterilized." [against their will]

We quote now from the official story of the project: "In Winston-Salem
and in [nearby] Orange County, North Carolina, the [Sterilization
League's] field committee had participated in testing projects to identify
school age children who should be considered for sterilization. The
project in Orange County was conducted by the University of North
Carolina and was financed by a 'Mr. Hanes,' a friend of Clarence Gamble
and supporter of the field work project in North Carolina. The Winston-
Salem project was also financed by Hanes. ["HANES" was underwear
mogul James Gordon Hanes, a trustee of Bowman Gray Medical
School and treasurer of Alice Gray's group]....

"The medical school had a long history of interest in eugenics and had
compiled extensive histories of families carrying inheritable disease.
In 1946, Dr. C. Nash Herndon ... made a statement to the press on 
the use of sterilization to prevent the spread of inheritable diseases....

"The first step after giving the mental tests to grade school children
was to interpret and make public the results. In Orange County the
results indicated that three percent of the school age children were
either insane or feebleminded.... [Then] the field committee hired a
social worker to review each case ... and to present any cases in
which sterilization was indicated to the State Eugenics Board, which
under North Carolina law had the authority to ORDER sterilization...."

Race science experimenter Dr. Claude Nash Herndon provided more
details in an interview in 1990: Note #3. Note #8.

"Alice Gray was the general supervisor of the project. She and Hanes
sent out letters promoting the program to the commissioners of all 100
counties in North Carolina.... What did I do? Nothing besides riding
herd on the whole thing! The social workers operated out of my office.
I was at the time also director of outpatient services at North Carolina
Baptist Hospital. We would see the [targeted] parents and children
there.... I.Q. tests were run on all the children in the Winston-Salem
public school system. Only the ones who scored really low [were
targeted for sterilization], the real bottom of the barrel, like below 70.

"Did we do sterilizations on young children? Yes. This was a
relatively minor operation.... It was usually not until the child was
eight or ten years old. For the boys, you just make an incision and
tie the tube.... We more often performed the operation on girls than
with boys. Of course, you have to cut open the abdomen, but again,
it is relatively minor."

Dr. Herndon remarked coolly that "we had a very good relationship
with the press" for the project. This is not surprising, since Gordon
Gray OWNED the "Winston-Salem Journal," the "Twin City Sentinel,"
AND radio station WSJS.

In 1950 and 1951, John Foster Dulles, then chairman of the ROCKE-
FELLER FOUNDATION, led John D. Rockefeller III on a series of 
world tours, focusing on the need to stop the expansion of the NON-
WHITE populations. In November 1952, Dulles and Rockefeller set 
up the Population Council, with tens of millions of dollars from the
Rockefeller family.

At that point, the American Eugenics Society, still cautious from
the recent bad publicity vis-a-vis Hitler, left its old headquarters at
Yale University. The Society moved its headquarters into the office
of the Population Council, and the two groups melded together. The
long-time secretary of the Eugenics Society, Frederick Osborne,
became the first president of the Population Council. The Gray
family's child-sterilizer, Dr. C. Nash Herndon, became president of
the American Eugenics Society in 1953, as its work expanded under
Rockefeller patronage.

Meanwhile, the International Planned Parenthood Federation was
founded in London, in the offices of the British Eugenics Society.

The undead enemy from World War II, renamed "Population Control,"
had now been revived.

George Bush was U.S. ambassador to the UNITED NATIONS in 1972,
when with prodding from Bush and his friends, the United States Agency
for International Development first made an official contract with the old
Sterilization League of America. The league had changed its name twice
again, and was now called the "Association for Voluntary Surgical
Contraception." The U.S. government began paying the old fascist 
group to sterilize non-whites in foreign countries.

The Gray family experiment had succeeded.
 
In 1988, the U.S. Agency for International Development signed its
latest contract with the old Sterilization League (a.k.a. "Association
for Voluntary Sterilization"), committing the U.S. government to spend
$80 million over five years.

Having gotten away with sterilizing several hundred North Carolina
school children, "not usually less than eight to ten years old," the
identical group is now authorized by President Bush to do it to 58
countries in Asia, Africa, and Ibero-America. The group modestly
claims it has directly sterilized only 2 million people, with 87
percent of the bill paid by U.S. taxpayers.

Meanwhile, Dr. Clarence Gamble, Boyden Gray's favorite soap
manufacturer, formed his own "Pathfinder Fund" as a split-off from
the Sterlization League. Gamble's Pathfinder Fund, with additional
millions from USAID, concentrates on penetration of local social
groups in the non-white countries, to break down psychological
resistance to the surgical sterilization teams.
