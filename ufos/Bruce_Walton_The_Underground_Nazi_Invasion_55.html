FEMA - The Secret Government

Some people have referred to it as the "secret government" of the United
States. It is not an elected body, it does not involve itself in public
disclosures, and it even has a quasi-secret budget in the billions of
dollars. This government organization has more power than the President of
the United States or the Congress, it has the power to suspend laws, move
entire populations, arrest and detain citizens without a warrant and hold
them without trial, it can seize property, food supplies, transportation
systems, and can suspend the Consti- tution.

Not only is it the most powerful entity in the United States, but it was
not even created under Constitutional law by the Congress. It was a product
of a Presidential Executive Order. No, it is not the U.S. military nor the
Central Intelligence Agency, they are subject to Congress [In regards to
the CIA, the "subject to Congress" part may be applicable to the "visible"
CIA, however there is an "invisible" CIA which IS NOT subject to Congress,
one that has succeeded in by-passing Congressional restrictions in regards
to underground facilities and black projects, non-regulated biogenetic and
mind control experi- ments, international drug trafficking, secret
technology research, assassinations and coups in third world nations not to
mention our own, and other activities not authorized by Congress or the
U.S. Constitution. The CIA is a 'double- agency' which outwardly appears as
a defender of U.S. Interests, however inwardly serves Bavarian Intelligence
and its plans for the implementation of a New World Order -- which is what
FEMA is all about. - Wol]. The organization is called FEMA, which stands
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Originally conceived in the
Richard Nixon Administration, it was refined by President Jimmy Carter and
given teeth in the Ronald Reagan and George [CIA] Bush Administrations.

FEMA had one original concept when it was created, to assure the
survivability of the United States government in the event of a nuclear
attack on this nation. It was also provided with the task of being a
federal coordinating body during times of domestic disasters, such as
earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Its awesome powers grow under the
tutelage of people like Lt. Col. Oliver North and General Richard Secord,
the architects on the Iran-Contra scandal and the LOOTING of America's
savings and loan institutions. FEMA has even been given control of the
State Defense Forces, a rag-tag, often con- sidered neo-Nazi, civilian army
that will substitute for the National Guard, if the Guard is called to duty
overseas.

THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Though it may be the most powerful organization in the United States, few
people know it even exists. But it has crept into our private lives. Even
mortgage papers contain FEMA's name in small print if the property in
question is near a flood plain. FEMA was deeply involved in the Los Angeles
riots and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Some of the BLACK HELICOPTER traffic reported throughout the United States,
but mainly in the West, California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas
and Colorado, are flown by FEMA personnel. FEMA has been given
responsibility for many new disasters including urban forest fires, home
heating emergencies, refugee situations, urban riots, and emergency
planning for nuclear and toxic incidents. In the West, it works in
conjunction with the Sixth Army.

FEMA was created in a series of Executive Orders. A Presidential Executive
Order, whether Constitutional OR NOT, becomes law simply by its publication
in the Federal Registry. Congress is BY-PASSED. Executive Order Number
12148 created the Federal Emergency Management Agency that is to interface
with the Department of Defense for civil defense planning and funding. An
"emergency czar" was appointed. FEMA has ONLY spent about 6 percent of its
budget on national emergencies, the bulk of their funding has been used for
the construction of SECRET UNDERGROUND FACILITIES to assure continuity of
government in case of a major emergency, foreign or domestic. Executive
Order Number 12656 appointed the National Security Council as the principal
body that should consider emergency powers. This allows the government to
INCREASE domestic intelligence and surveillance of U.S. citizens and would
RESTRICT the freedom of movement within the United States and grant the
government the right to isolate large groups of civilians. The National
Guard could be federalized to seal all borders and take control of U.S. air
space and all ports of entry.

Here are just a few Executive Orders associated with FEMA that would
SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTION AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS. These Executive Orders
have been on record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the stroke
of a Presidential pen:

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of
     transportation and control of highways and seaports.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the
     communication media.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all
     electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food
     resources and farms.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into
     work brigades under government supervision.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health,
     education and welfare functions.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a
     national registration of all persons.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports
     and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to
     relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate
     areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads,
     inland waterways and public storage facilities.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of
     Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders
     into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic
     or financial crisis.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to
     enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial
     support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all
     aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise
     and assist the President.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to
     federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive
     Orders issued over a fifteen year period.

   * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Prepared- ness
     Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of
     production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries,
     credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institutions in any
     undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of
     emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the
     action for six months.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has broad powers in every aspect of
the nation. General Frank Salzedo, chief of FEMA's Civil Security Division
stated in a 1983 conference that he saw FEMA's role as a "new frontier in
the protection of individual and governmental leaders from assassination,
and of civil and military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as
well as prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion,
or a global audience in times of crisis."

FEMA's powers were consolidated by President Carter to incorporate:

   * the National Security Act of 1947, which allows for the strategic re-
     location of industries, services, government and other essential
     economic activities, and to rationalize the requirements for manpower,
     resources and production facilities;

   * the 1950 Defense Production Act, which gives the President sweeping
     powers over all aspects of the economy;

   * the Act of August 29, 1916, which authorizes the Secretary of the
     Army, in time of war, to take possession of any transportation system
     for transporting troops, material, or any other purpose related to the
     emergency; and

   * the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which enables the
     President to seize the property of a foreign country or national.

These powers were transferred to FEMA in a sweeping consolidation in 1979.

HURRICANE ANDREW FOCUSED ATTENTION ON FEMA

FEMA's deceptive role really did not come to light with much of the public
until Hurricane Andrew smashed into the U.S. mainland. As Russell R. Dynes,
director of the Disaster Research Center of the University of Delaware,
wrote in The World and I, "...The eye of the political storm hovered over
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA became a convenient target
for criticism." Because FEMA was accused of dropping the ball in Florida,
the media and Congress commenced to study this agency. What came out of the
critical look was that FEMA was spending 12 times more for "black
operations" than for disaster relief. It spent $1.3 billion building secret
bunkers throughout the United States in anticipation of government
disruption by foreign or domestic upheaval. Yet fewer than 20 members of
Congress, only members with top security clearance, know of the $1.3
billion expenditure by FEMA for non-natural disaster situations. These few
Congres- sional leaders state that FEMA has a "black curtain" around its
operations. FEMA has worked on National Security programs since 1979, and
its pre- decessor, the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency, has secretly
spent millions of dollars before being merged into FEMA by President Carter
in 1979.

FEMA has developed 300 sophisticated mobile units that are capable of
sustaining themselves for a month. The vehicles are located in five areas
of the United States. They have tremendous communication systems and each
contains a generator that would provide power to 120 homes each, but have
never been used for disaster relief.

FEMA's enormous powers can be triggered easily. In any form of domestic or
foreign problem, perceived and not always actual, emergency powers can be
enacted. The President of the United States now has broader powers to
declare martial law, which activates FEMA's extraordinary powers. Martial
law can be declared during time of increased tension overseas, eco- nomic
problems within the United States, such as a depression, civil unrest, such
as demonstrations or scenes like the Los Angeles riots, and in a drug
crisis. These Presidential powers have increased with successive Crime
Bills, particularly the 1991 and 1993 Crime Bills, which INCREASE THE POWER
TO SUSPEND THE RIGHTS GUARENTEED UNDER THE CONSTI- TUTION and to seize
property of those suspected of being drug dealers, to individuals who
participate in a public protest or demonstration. [Note: FEMA and the
Secret Government have the advantage all the way around -- IF the executive
orders are put into effect. If there is little resistance, then their Nazi
dictatorship will become a reality. However it is more likely that anarchy
and civil conflict will be the result. This could be used as an excuse to
bring in a UNITED NATIONS "peace-keeping" force to occupy the United
States. You know, those guys who explode the skulls of little children with
machine gun fire in South Africa and elsewhere and then joke about it among
themselves later. If the U.N. forces fail, they may pressure member nations
to commit their armies to a full-scale United Nations - New World Order
multi-national military invasion and attack upon the American militias who
will undoubtedly band together as a massive resistance force, if worst
comes to worse. - Wol.] Under emergency plans already in existence, the
power exists to SUSPEND THE CONSTITUTION and turn over the reigns of
government to FEMA and [to] appoint military commanders to run state and
local governments. FEMA then would have the right to order the detention of
anyone whom there is reasonable ground to believe...will engage in, or
'probably' conspire with others to engage in acts of espionage or sabotage.
The plan also authorized the establishment of CONCENTRATION CAMPS for
detaining the accused [that is, basically anyone who they may consider to
be a 'probable' threat, or rather all of those who choose not to live under
a national socialist dictator- ship. - Wol.], but no trial.

THREE TIMES since 1984, FEMA stood on the threshold of taking control of
the nation. ONCE under President Reagan in 1984, and TWICE UNDER PRESIDENT
BUSH in 1990 and 1992. But under those three scen- arios, there was not a
sufficient crisis to warrant risking martial law. Most experts on the
subject of FEMA and Martial Law insisted that a crisis has to appear
dangerous enough for the people of the United States before they would
tolerate or accept complete government takeover. The typical crisis needed
would be threat of imminent nuclear war, rioting in several U.S. cites
simultaneously, a series of national disasters that affect widespread
danger to the populous, massive terrorist attacks, a depression in which
tens of millions are unemployed and without financial resources, or a major
environ- mental disaster.

THREE TIMES FEMA STOOD BY READY FOR EMERGENCY

In April 1984, President Reagan signed Presidential Director Number 54 that
allowed FEMA to engage in a secret national "readiness exercise" under the
code name of REX 84. The exercise was to test FEMA's readiness to assume
military authority in the event of a "State of Domestic National Emergency"
concurrent with the launching of a direct United States military operation
in Central America. The plan called for the deputation of U.S. military and
National Guard units so that they could 'legally' be used for domestic law
enforcement. These units would be assigned to conduct sweeps and take into
custody an estimated 400,000 undocumented Central American immi- grants in
the United States. The immigrants would be interned at 10 detention centers
to be set up at military bases throughout the country.

REX 84 was so highly guarded that special metal security doors were placed
on the fifth floor of the FEMA building in Washington, D.C. Even long-
standing employees of the Civil Defense of the Federal Executive Department
possessing the highest possible security clearances were not being allowed
through the newly installed metal security doors. Only personnel wearing a
special red Christian cross or crucifix lapel pin [apparently hiding behind
a 'Christian' symbol so as not to divert suspicion to their satanic plans,
kind of like the 'Society of Jesus' or 'Jesuits' who appear outwardly
Christian yet in- wardly believe and practice gnostic-paganism. - Wol.]
were allowed into the premises. Lt. Col. North was responsible for drawing
up the emergency plan, which U.S. Attorney General William French Smith
opposed vehemently. The plan called for the suspension of the Constitution,
turning control of the government over to FEMA, appointment of military
commanders to run state and local governments and the declaration of
Martial Law. The Presidential Executive Orders to support such a plan were
already in place. The plan also advocated the rounding up and transfer to
"assembly centers or relocation camps" of a least 21 MILLION American
Negroes in the event of massive rioting or disorder, NOT UNLIKE the
rounding up of the Jews in Nazi Germ- any in the 1930s.

The second known time that FEMA stood by was in 1990 when Desert Storm was
enacted. Prior to President Bush's invasion of Iraq, FEMA began to draft
new legislation to increase its already formidable powers. One of the
elements incorporated into the plan was to set up operations within any
state or locality WITHOUT the prior permission of local or state
authorities. Such prior permission has always been required in the past.
Much of the mechanism being set into place was in anticipation of the
economic collapse of the Western World. The war with Iraq may have been
conceived as a ploy to boost the bankrupt economy, but it only pushed the
West into deeper re- cession.

The third scenario for FEMA came with the Los Angeles riots after the
Rodney King brutality verdict. Had the rioting spread to other cities, FEMA
would have been empowered to step in. As it was, major rioting only
occurred in the Los Angeles area, thus preventing a pretext for a FEMA
response.

On July 5, 1987, the Miami Herald published reports on FEMA's new goals.
The goal was to suspend the Constitution in the event of a national crisis,
such as nuclear war, violent and widespread internal dissent, or national
opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad. Lt. Col. North was the
architect. National Security Directive Number 52 issued in August 1982,
pertains to the "Use of National Guard Troops to Quell Disturbances."

[National Guard troops WERE called-in to quell the Los Angeles roits,
however the fascist para- sites in our government were unable to carry
their plans through to the desired conclusion of nation-wide martial law
and suspension of the Constitution. No doubt they WILL try again. - Wol.]
The crux of the problem is that FEMA has the power to turn the United
States into a police state in time of a real crisis or a manufactured
crisis. Lt. Col. North virtually established the apparatus for
dictatorship. Only the criticism of the Attorney General prevented the
plans from being adopted. But intelligence reports indicate that FEMA has a
folder with 22 Executive Orders for the Presi- dent to sign in case of an
emergency. It is believed those Executive Orders contain the framework of
North's concepts, delayed by criticism but never truly abandoned.

[Note: If we are to play by their rules... then why not declare ALL
EXECUTIVE ORDERS which have been implemented from the time of the CIA's
take-over of the White House in 1963 -- as a result of its partial coup
d'etat resulting in the murder of President John F. Kennedy who enacted
executive orders to DISBAND the CIA -- to be NULL AND VOID? And why not
charge those subsequent administrations, who have knowingly or unknowingly
collabor- ated with the fascist "parasite government" as being assessories
to murder, conspiracy, and treason? - Wol.] The crisis, as the government
now sees it, is civil unrest. For generations, the government was concerned
with nuclear war, but the violent and disruptive demonstrations that
surrounded the Vietnam War era prompted President NIXON to change the
direction of emergency powers from war time to times of domestic unrest.
Diana Raynolds, program director of the Edward R. Murrow Center, summed up
the dangers of FEMA today and the public reaction to Martial Law in a drug
crisis: "It was James Madison's worst nightmare that a [federal] faction
would someday be strong enough to sweep away the Constitutional restraints
designed by the framers to prevent the tyranny of centralized power,
excessive privilege, an arbitrary governmental authority over the
individual. These restraints, the balancing and checking of powers among
branches and layers of government, and the civil guarantees, would be the
first casualties in a drug-induced national security state with Reagan's
Civil Emergency Preparedness unleashed. Nevertheless, there would be those
who would welcome NSC (National Security Council) into the drug fray,
believing that increasing state police powers to emergency levels is the
only way left to fight American's enemy within. (Hopefully the CIA will
carry their 'drug war' to its ultimate conclusion by implicating the worst
international drug traffickers of all -- namely, THEMSELVES! - Wol.) In the
short run, a national security state would probably be a relief to those
whose personal security and quality of life has been diminished by drugs or
drug related crime. And, as the general public watches the progression of
institutional chaos and social decay, they too may be willing to pay the
ultimate price, one drug free America for 200 years of democracy."

The first targets in any FEMA emergency would be Hispanics and Blacks, the
FEMA orders call for them to be rounded up and detained. Tax protesters,
demonstrators against government military intervention outside U.S.
borders, and people who maintain weapons in their homes are also targets.
Operation Trojan Horse is a program designed to learn the identity of
potential opponents to martial law. The program lures potential protesters
into public forums, conducted by a "hero" of the people who advocates
survival training. The list of names gathered at such meetings and rallies
are computerized and then targeted in case of an emergency.

The most shining example of America to the world has been its peaceful
transition of government from one administration to another. Despite crises
of great magnitude, the United States has maintained its freedom and
liberty. This nation now stands on the threshold of rule by NOM-ELECTED
people asserting NON- CONSTITUTIONAL powers. Even Congress 'cannot' review
a Martial Law action until six months after it has been declared. For the
first time in American history, the reigns of government would not be
transferred from one elected element to another, but the Constitution,
itself, can be suspended.

The scenarios established to trigger FEMA into action are generally found
in the society today, economic collapse, civil unrest, drug problems,
terrorist attacks, and protests against American intervention in a foreign
country. All these premises exist, it could only be a matter of time in
which one of these triggers the entire emergency necessary to bring FEMA
into action, and then it may be too late, because under the FEMA plan,
there is no contingency by which Consti- tutional power is restored. (I
would suggest that even the Congress would not be 'allowed' to review the
martial law status after six months, in that the Consti- tutional workings
of Congress could inevitably be disabled as well. If such a scenario became
a reality it would be an all-out MILITARY battle for control... between the
pro Independence Militias or the REAL Americans; and the pro New World
Order infiltrators or the CIA/Corporate fascists and their European
collabor- ators. - Wol.)
