FIRE FROM THE SKY: Battle of Harvest Moon & True Story of Space Shuttles

by "One Who Knows"

PART 1:

As I begin writing this report, the news is telling about a strange USAIR
airplane crash in Pennsylvania. Next day a plane crashed in Moscow. CNN
told about a fireball that was reported from Bakersfield, California, to
Medford, Oregon. They said it occurred about 6 or 6:15 in the morning on
Saturday, September 10 (1994) and was so bright that the light shining
through windows woke up some people. They showed a house in San Rafael with
a hole in the roof from a piece of something falling from the sky.

An Ariane rocket was launched from French Guyana and was lost, a day
before. Several earthquakes have occurred in California, including one that
CNN showed on a map, southwest of Lake Tahoe. About 15 minutes later, CNN
began telling about the Space Shuttle firing lasers at Earth and showed a
view of Earth, with Lake Tahoe in the upper right corner of the screen. If
you put the two together, then you see that the Columbia Space Shuttle is
firing laser beams at Earth "for environmental purposes," precisely where
the earthquakes are occurring. The President went to Camp David, then when
the President returned (?), a plane crashed into the White House. Later he
gave a speech in a room of the White House, then just after he left a fire
broke out in the room. Rosh Hashanah is recently passed (September 6-7,
1994), and Yom Kippur is coming up (September 15, 1994). The President has
ordered 8,300 Navy, 1,800 Marine and 4,000 Army personnel along with 15 or
20 warships to [prepare to] invade Haiti.

SECRET WARS BETWEEN POWERS THAT BE

If what you are about to read does not scare the pants off you, then you
must not be wearing any. Pay attention and this information may save your
life. The purpose of this article is to inform you briefly about some of
the secret wars that are going on between the Powers-That-Be that are
struggling for control of the world.

In 1978, I was head of a Mensa special interest group called the Doomsday
Club News and Intelligence Report. I wrote a newsletter for the Club. In
the May, 1978, issue I said:

"WAR is an ever-present danger, much closer than most people realize. Now
Russia is testing 'killer satellites' and laser and particle beam weapons,
while the U.S. is undertaking a major program to develop counterbeam
weapons - a real Star Wars battle is taking shape. War in space is now
possible and the likelihood of it grows. A program is now under way to
determine the feasibility of using the Space Shuttle for defense purposes."
What I did not know at that time, was the fact that the space war had
already started. This manuscript will provide more details.

In the same newsletter, I mentioned that Richard Helms of the CIA had been
fired by President Carter, and recommended that the reader contact the
Security & Intelligence Fund (at address included) for more information. I
listed the staff members a s James Angleton, Elbridge Durbrow, Brig Gen.
Robert Richardson, Former Secy. of Navy and Treasury Robert Anderson,
former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral G. W. Anderson, and other names
that become important later in this story.

SHIFTING DEFENSE STRATEGIES

On page 10, I said: "The U.S. is shifting its defense to sub-launched
ballistics missiles and air-launched cruise missiles, as silo-based ICBMs
become vulnerable to a pre-emptive first strike by the Soviet Union." The
B-52, F-14, F-15, and F-16 will be equipped with cruise missiles over the
next five years, in the Pacific Region. This posture indicates admission
that nothing standing still in the U.S. can be protected - only aircraft
and submarines have a chance of surviving a first strike.

"Independent congressional studies already have been completed that show
that by 1980 the Russians could conduct a first strike against the
Minuteman force with a strong probability of being able to destroy the
majority of U.S. ICBMs, and that by as early as 1981 the U.S. will no
longer have a sufficient deterrent to preclude a Soviet first strike." I
continued with a quote from Aviation Week & Space Technology, (p. 14, Apr.
3, 1978), about the numbers of missiles that we and Russia had. Later on
the page I mentioned about Defense Secretary Harold Brown proposing a sharp
increase in civil defense spending, including funding a study to plan
faster evacuation of cities during threat of a nuclear attack. What was
going on? Why was the U.S. shifting its defense strategy, and suddenly
emphasizing the importance of civil defense?

In my July issue of the DCN&IR newsletter, I quoted General George S.
Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said: "What the Soviets
are doing is unsettling, principally because none of us know why." I said:
"General Alexander Haig, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, warned
Washington in March of the fundamental change in the Warsaw Pact Air Arm to
"an offensive character." I continued by saying that I felt that Russia was
preparing to defend itself from the threat of a rearmed Germany. I
mentioned that most of the U.S. nuclear force was on German soil. On page 7
I said that "Japan, for the first time since World War II, has ordered its
armed forces to prepare defense plans to protect itself from foreign
attack."

On page 10, I quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn as saying, "No weapons, no
matter how powerful, can help the West until it overcomes its loss of
willpower. To defend oneself, one must be ready to die."

PARTICLE BEAM TECHNOLOGY RIDICULED

Th cover headline article of my October 1978 issue was NUCLEAR WEAPONS -
SOON OBSOLETE! The following is what that article said:

General George Keegan - grad of Harvard, flew 56 combat missions in WWII,
earned Distinguished Service Cross in Vietnam, Executive VP of U.S.
Strategic Institute, Chief of U.S. Air Force Intelligence. About two years
ago he retired from the Air Force, because he saw some critical dangers to
the U.S. that he was not allowed to reveal to the public. He tried to warn
the Powers in the White House but they laughed at him. So about 19 months
ago he made the first public references to secret Russian research on
*charged-particle beam weapons.* Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine
followed up on his information and determined that he was essentially
correct. However, President Carter and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, both
badly briefed by the CIA, ridiculed Keegan.

U.S. scientists at Lawrence Livermore Lab (bicycle riding distance from me)
undertook Project See-Saw to determine if the U.S. could build particle
beam weapons. The decision was that it was presently impossible to build
such a weapon and since we are so far ahead of the Soviets technologically,
it was ridiculous to think they were building one. Keegan revealed his
findings on Soviet particle beam developments to CIA head William Colby in
1975. Colby convened the Nuclear Intelligence Panel which determined that,
since the US could not build such a weapon, it was impossible that the
Soviets were doing it. Colby never passed the information from the Air
Force intelligence on to the President or Secretary of Defense.

Keegan retired and started making the information public, through the
American Security Council (of which I am a member of the National Advisory
Board) and other groups. His story was greeted with high-level official
sneering, the most acrimonious sneers coming from the self-styled "nuclear
engineer" President Jimmy Carter and Defense Secretary Harold Brown
(formerly from Lawrence Livermore Lab). "But despite the official denials,
the Soviets continued their work, carrying at least eight electron-beam
experiments into space on board Cosmos, Soyuz and Salyut spacecraft..." (AW
& ST) and conducting tests at Semipalatinsk and Sarova. "At the same time,
younger U.S. physicists, uninhibited by the ego problems of their elders,
also were making progress on the key techniques required for beam weapons
development.

Now the tide has turned. A full-scale U.S. effort to tackle the technology
required to determine the feasibility of beam weapons development is being
organized at the highest level in the Pentagon. Even the most stubborn
skeptics now acknowledge that leaving this field uncontested to the Soviets
is a risk the U.S. cannot afford to take. Because of the extreme public
embarrassment this series [of articles] will bring to... President Jimmy
Carter, and Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who saw his contemporaries try
and fail in Project See-Saw, there is still an attempt to shroud the
program in official secrecy" (Aviation Week & Space Technology, Oct. 2,
1978).

The article states, "Experts on Capitol Hill, who have surveyed all the
evidence including secret data not available to us, have concluded that
Gen. Keegan's assessment was essentially correct..." Edward Teller has
informed key senators that Gen. Keegan's analysis was right on the core of
the matter."

The Soviets have already successfully tested particle beam weapons (as has
France!). "U.S. particle beam weapons experts who have access to U.S.
intelligence information and personal contacts with Russian physicists
involved in magnetic and plasma physics programs believe the Soviets will
field a ground-based proton beam weapon between 1980-1983."

SIPAPU PROJECT

The Pentagon has initiated a program called "Chair Heritage" to field our
own system by about 1982. It formerly was mostly a Navy program at the
Naval Post-graduate facility in Monterey, CA, but is now being combined
with the Army SIPAPU project (space beams, as opposed to beams carried on
Navy vessels) and others - it seems that now everybody who is anybody is
getting involved (Lawrence Livermore Lab, Sandia Corp., Defense Nuclear
Agency, CIA, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, University of Texas, Austin
Research Associates, etc.).

If you remember, Russia beat us into space with Sputnik, then we went into
a crash program to get ahead of them. Vannevar Bush once said that it was
impossible to build a ballistics missile capable of going 3000 miles, but
within 10 years Russia had them and we were just beginning a crash program
to catch up.

Now we are once again in a race for strategic superiority, but this time
Russia may field their system in 2 years while it appears that we require
at least 5 years - but then things can change quickly.

A problem we now have is the top leadership - the President and Secretary
of Defense - may hold back progress because they do not like to admit their
mistake. In the past, there were several intelligence services, all in
competition with each other trying to be the most accurate and when one
service goofed, the other pointed it out. Now, Carter has unified the
intelligence services under Stansfield Turner and all intelligence reports
must be through Turner before they get to the Defense Secretary or
President from men such as Gen. Keegan, Gen. Singlaub, etc. It also creates
the chance that the President can be considerably misinformed or
uninformed. This, in the long run, could be an even greater danger to the
U.S. than the particle beam weapon!

PARTICLE BEAM CAPABILITIES

So what is a particle beam weapon? It is similar to a laser, but it is not
a laser. Lasers shoot a beam of electromagnetic radiation (light), while
particle beam weapons shoot a beam of sub-atomic particles (electrons,
protons, ions, etc.). What this means is that NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAY SOON
BECOME OBSOLETE.

Whoever puts satellites with particle beam weapons into orbit first
(property controlled by complex sensors and computers) can control the
world. ANY GUIDED MISSILE OR AIRCRAFT CAN THEN BE ZAPPED OUT OF EXISTENCE
IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND AFTER LAUNCH.

Under those conditions, we will still have nuclear bombs, but it would be
impossible to deliver them against an enemy who is protected by particle
beams.

An editorial in AW & ST said, "For beam weapons offer the promise of
reducing strategic nuclear weapons to a negligible factor in the future. If
successfully deployed, beam weapons can end the long reign of nuclear
terror introduced by the ballistic missile and its thermonuclear warhead.
If the Soviets achieve this capability first, it will give them enormous
crucial leverage in imposing their political will on the rest of the world.
If the U.S. achieves it first, there will be no need for flimsy SALT
agreements, and in a dead heat, the citizens of this planet can look
forward to a shifting of international tensions from the strategic nuclear
area to more conventional and less devastating weapons."

If you want to know what particle beam weapons are like, just watch "Star
Wars" or Battlestar Galactica."

This is the end of the quote from my 1978 newsletter. And now, as Paul
Harvey would say, for the rest of the story!

Russia launched the Intercosmos 17 octagon space vehicle on September 26,
1977. The *Encyclopedia Brittanica* says its purpose was for "international
scientific research in charged particles and micrometeorites." What, a
charged particle satellite? Already in space? What did we just read above?
"If the Soviets achieve this capability FIRST, it will give them enormous
crucial leverage in imposing their political will on the rest of the
world."

WAR IN SPACE

The Battle of the Harvest Moon began on September 17, 1977. Russia began
destroying our spy satellites using "killer satellites." On September 27,
Russia destroyed our SECRET MOON BASE. On September 29, 1977, Russia
launched the Salyut 6 manned space station into orbit.

First, let's explore a little background. The book *War In Space* by James
Canan, 1982, Harper & Row, p. 153 says: "High-energy weapons, their perils
and their promise, began penetrating the congressional consciousness in the
late seventies, and it was Major General George J. Keegan USAF - 'crazy
George' to his critic, 'brilliant George' to his admirers - who started it
all. Keegan undoubtedly harbored one of the very highest IQs ever to grace
the military establishment, which is, stereotypes to the contrary, saying
quite a lot.

Keegan was in Air Force intelligence for many years, and in charge of it,
starting in 1972, for five... By the mid-seventies, Keegan's Air Force
intelligence empire, as his critics dubbed it, had a population of about
50,000 and was spending nearly $3 billion a year. Keegan had access to
HUMINT sources inside Russia and elsewhere, to all the albums of the
photorecce satellites and all the tapes of the ELINT satellites."

P. 155: "In 1972, a young civilian scientist in the employ of Air Force
intelligence had come to Keegan with 'evidence of a Soviet effort to
develop one of the greatest strategic weapons of all time - a beam weapon
of great, high energy that would be used to destroy ballistic missiles in
flight for the ultimate defense of the Soviet Union.'

Having spent three years studying nuclear physics at the graduate level,
Keegan took it upon himself to team up with that young scientist in the
examination of evidence gleaned from unclassified Soviet scientific papers.
He concluded that the young man was onto something, and he put his troops
to work. With Keegan in direct control, an Air Force intelligence team
sifted and collated reports from inside Russia and from satellite
photographs and communications intercepts concerning a sprawling complex of
buildings, pipes, and what-not at Semipalatinsk in south-central Soviet
Asia.

What the Soviets had built there - starting with their underground
positioning of two huge spheres in the early 1970s - was a facility for the
testing of charged-particle beams... a sizable segment of the U.S.
scientific community jumped all over Keegan, accusing him of trafficking in
paranoia."

P. 157: "In 1974, two years after General Keegan began sounding off in
top-secret circles about the Russian work at Semipalatinsk, particle beams
came back into vogue at the Pentagon. A Defense Department document
described what happened: the Navy initiated its "Chair Heritage' program
involving electron beam development [for] 'application to defense of ships
against all forms of attack by aircraft and missiles... The Army also began
a separate program to demonstrate the production of high-current ion
beams.'

The first Army program, called 'SIPAPU' (an American Indian word for sacred
fire) is controlled by the Ballistic Missile Defense Command at Redstone
Arsenal, Alabama, and centered at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.
Chair Heritage, transferred to DARPA control in 1980, is being conducted by
the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Livermore..." I trust that some of my
readers will take note of that word "Sipapu."

SECRET PROJECTS

Until mid-1979, I worked for Control Data Corporation in Sunnyvale,
California, in the "skunk works" division. One of the projects on which I
worked was Chair Heritage.

For confirmation for researchers, I will provide the following information:
My boss was Phil Myers. Program Managers were JM Moore (TIGS, IOS
projects), Jack Crawford, JL Smith, CR Shuler, LH Woodward, WA Osborne, and
others.

Some of the projects were code named STC, RFREDA, BRONCO, MARE ISLAND, A4,
LATFAC, DALFAC, RKYDSO, etc. It would do you no good to know what these
names stood for - TIGS stood for Terminal Integrated Graphics, IOS was
Integrated Operating Systems, DALFAC was Dallas Facility, etc.

Just suffice to say that we had the world's most powerful computers (Star
100 which was a Cray computer, etc.) and we were involved in the U.S.'s
most secret projects. Our customers included the weather facility at
Monterey, CA, (weather satellites do more than observe the weather),
Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency), NASA, and, oh yes, THE IRS. One of my friends spent all his free
time away from the job studying anti-gravity, so it was not too hard to
guess what his job concerned.

General Keegan and Carter's Secretary of Defense Harold Brown did not see
eye to eye - could the fact that Brown's father was a Russian Jew (I forget
his real name) have had anything to do with it? As a military officer,
Keegan was forbidden to say anything to the public, so in January 1977
Keegan resigned and set up the civilian American Security Council and began
traveling over the country giving speeches to try to awaken everybody. He
failed.

Keegan died in March, 1993. His obituary in the *New York Times* said, "He
asserted that the Soviet Union was building a civil-defense system that
would ensure a reasonable rate of survival from nuclear exchange. He also
believed that the Russians were close to deploying futuristic charged
particle-beam weapons." The book *Deep Black: Space Espionage and National
Security* by William E. Burrows, Random House, a history of spy satellites,
has more information on Keegan.

SKYLAB MISSIONS

Have you ever REALLY wondered why the U.S. never went to the moon again? Do
you remember *Skylab?* The official story is *Skylab* was launched May 14,
1973. It was to be America's manned space station. On 5/25/73 a Saturn
rocket carried the first crew (Conrad, Kerwin & Weitz) to *Skylab,* a
mission that lasted nearly a month.

The second crew (Alan Bean, Owen Garriott, and Jack Lousma) was launched
7/28/73, a mission that lasted nearly two months. Both missions were
plagued by failures, leaks and other problems.

The third manned *Skylab* mission began November 14 with Gerald Carr,
William Pogue and Edward Gibson. It was said that the mission was delayed
six days because of cracks in the Saturn rocket's tail fins.

Russia had launched a space station on April 3, but on April 14 it blew up,
what was described as a "catastrophic malfunction."

"BAD LUCK" AT NASA

After the amazing successes of the Apollo missions, for some reason NASA
started having all kinds of bad luck. "In the U.S. the success of the first
flight of the Space Shuttle orbiter was clouded by two catastrophic
failures of previously reliable rocket launch vehicles.

After preliminary taxi test on the runway and flights mated to its Boeing
747 jet carrier plane, the Shuttle orbiter Enterprise was pronounced ready
for release from its mother plane. On August 12, at Edwards Air Force Base
in California, astronauts Fred W. Haise, Jr., and C. Gordon Fullerton
guided the Enterprise to a 'superslick' landing on the floor of Rogers Dry
Lake 5 minutes and 23 seconds after being released from the 747.

A second flight, with astronauts Joe H. Engle and Richard H. Truly, on
September 13 was equally successful. Haise and Fullerton put the Enterprise
through yet another landing ten days later. An ill omen appeared at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida in mid-May, when a small, strap-on
solid-propellant booster rocket fell from its bracket on the first stage of
a Delta vehicle and damaged it. The booster was being prepared to launch
the Orbital Test Satellite for ESA.

The satellite was destroyed on September 13 when its Delta launch vehicle
exploded one minute after lift-off, apparently because one of its
solid-propellant strap-on rockets detonated. Only 16 days later, a Centaur
booster with an Intellsat 4A communications satellite on board also went up
in flames only one minute after launch" (*Encyclopedia Brittanica Book of
the Year,* 1978, p. 638.

Friends, it's time you learned the real story. In October, 1977, a newly
operational Russian Cosmos Interceptor shot down *Skylab. Skylab,* along
with its crew of five American astronauts secretly aboard, died in a giant
fireball over the United States. NASA immediately initiated a prolonged
cover-up of what had happened. How do I know? Suffice it to say, I have a
very high-up source of information.
