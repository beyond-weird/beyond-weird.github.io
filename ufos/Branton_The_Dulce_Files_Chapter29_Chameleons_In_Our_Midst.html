"THEY LIVE": CHAMELEONS IN OUR MIDST!?





John A. Keel, in his book 'OUR HAUNTED PLANET', gives an interesting
introduction to the reality of an alien race that has taken careful
measures to remain hidden from the mass consciousness of those dwelling on
the surface of planet earth -- or those ignorant 'human cattle' whom they
are intent on manipulating and exploiting from their secret hiding places
above, below and even amongst the inhabitants of planet earth:

"...The parahuman Serpent People of the past are still among us. They were
probably worshipped by the builders of Stonehenge and the forgotten
ridge-making cultures of South America.

"...In some parts of the world the Serpent People successfully posed as
gods and imitated the techniques of the super-intelligence [God]. This led
to the formation of pagan religions centered around human sacrifices. The
conflict, so far as man himself was concerned, became one of religions and
races. Whole civilizations based upon the worship of these false gods rose
and fell in Asia, Africa, and South America. The battleground had been
chosen, and the mode of conflict had been decided upon.

"The human race would supply the pawns. The mode of control was complicated
as usual. Human beings were largely free of direct control. Each individual
HAD TO CONSCIOUSLY COMMIT HIMSELF TO ONE OF THE OPPOSING FORCES...

"The main battle was for what was to become known as the human soul.

"Once an individual had committed himself, he opened a door so that an
indefinable something could actually enter his body and exercise some
control over his subconscious mind.

"...the Serpent People or OMEGA Group, attacked man in various ways, trying
to rid the planet of him. But the super-intelligence was still able to look
over man... God worked out new ways of communication and control, always in
conflict with the Serpent People."

In relation to these 'Serpent People' -- who some claim are now living
among us and have been doing so for a very long time -- the anonymous
Intelligence officer and planetary patriot 'Commander X' released details
of an incident which may well have come right out of a John Carpenter
movie, if not for the fact that the Commander himself, from his own
high-security position within the Intelligence Community, is convinced of
its potential reality:



"...Another story comes from a private stationed on the surface at Dulce.
He soon realized something mighty 'odd' was going on around there, but it
took a while to put his finger on it.

"'One morning last September, I was working on a routine job when another
of the young enlistees, a mechanic, came in with a small rush job he wanted
welded at once. He had the print and proceeded to show me exactly what he
wanted. We are both bending over the bench in front of the welder when I
happened to look directly into his face. It seemed to suddenly become
covered with a semi-transparent film or cloud. His features faded and in
their place appeared a 'thing' with bulging eyes, no hair and SCALES for
skin. I stood and looked at it for about 20 seconds. WHATEVER IT WAS stood
and looked at me without moving. Then the strange face seemed to fade away,
and at the same time recede into the ordinary face of the young man
underneath. The dissipation of the imposed face lasted or took about five
seconds before it was completely gone and I was standing there weak, my
mouth open and staring at the young man who had come in with the rush
order. The young 'man' did not seem to be conscious of the elapsed time
when I had observed all this but went right on talking about the job as if
nothing had happened.

"'This is hard to take but I assure you it was still harder for me. No one
can realize a jolt you could get from seeing anything like this until they
have experienced it for themselves. It was several days before I had myself
convinced that maybe after all what I had seen was real and that I was not
suffering from illusions and the beginning of insanity. Days passed before
I saw this particular phenomena again. The next time was later at night at
the guard house near the front gate, on the way to work. I had purchased
some small items and on arriving I went around to the guard house with my
slip to retrieve my package. There was only one guard on duty. I handed him
the check and he began to look at the package, taking his time. I waited a
minute, then happened to look directly at him again. His face began to
change. Again a face of a strange creature was imposed. You could see
through the imposed face for a few seconds and then it became the only one
visible [solidified is the word] and again about 20 seconds duration. Again
five seconds for dissipation and the guard started to move normally again,
found my package and gravely handed it to me and I walked out without a
word being said.'"

Since coming across this report from the 'Commander', I made an effort to
see if there were any other similar accounts that might confirm the
existence of 'Chameleons' or alien 'infiltrators' working on the surface of
planet earth in an apparent attempt to pass themselves off as human beings
and blend-in with our society, for whatever nefarious agenda they might be
serving. Some of the reports of quasi-human infiltrators spoke of the "Men
In Black" who have terrorized UFO witnesses. Although many of the 'M.I.B.'
who have been reported were obviously humans working for some obscure
surface, other-planetary or subterranean intelligence agency AS WELL AS
others that appeared to be either cyborgs, clones or even paraphysical
manifestations, there was a branch of the so-called MIB which betrayed
definite reptilian characteristics. These in essence were reptilian
humanoids with a full-blown -- although at times not-too-convincing --
'reconstructive surgery' job, apparently intended to allow them to operate
in human society undetected. Some of the early 'infiltrators' betrayed
themselves with their 'plastic' or artificial appearance, whereas in more
recent years the 'disguise' has become far more

sophisticated with the advent of molecular shape-shifting
occult-technology, techno-hypnotic transmitters, and portable
laser-hologram technology [according to one source], and therefore harder
to detect. However there ARE ways...



Researcher George Andrews, in his book EXTRATERRESTRIAL FRIENDS AND FOES
[ILLUMINET PRESS., P.O. Box 2808., Lilburn, GA 30226] quotes a statement
made by Valdamar Valerian, director of LEADING EDGE RESEARCH:

"...A friend of mine and four of his friends experimented with crystalline
structures a year or two ago (mid-1980's - Branton), and they figured out
how to cut them along certain planes so they could actually see the aura or
energy field around people. That's when they discovered that all people
aren't 'people', or the people they thought they were. It appears that some
E.T. humanoids have a dark blue ovoid aura. (Note: Aura cameras developed
by Chuck Shramek -- yes, the same Chuck Shramek of the 'Hale-Bopp
Companion' controversy -- and others clearly show the 7 multi-colored
'chakra' points of the human soul/spirit matrix. Presumably since
reptilians have NO soul, they would have NO multicolored auric field. -
Branton). It so happens that all the people they checked that met this
criteria also wore dark glasses and made every attempt to act like they
really wanted nothing to do with people in general.

"They followed one of these people out into the desert where he evidently
had a trailer. After waiting until dusk, they made a pretense of needing
help and knocked on the door. After a short while, the light went on and
the man came to the door. He looked normal, EXCEPT THAT HIS PUPILS WERE
VERTICAL SLITS INSTEAD OF CIRCLES. It works. The only trouble is that it
costs $2,000 to put a pair of those glasses together..."



Several areas across the Western U.S. where surface and/or underground
military installations exist have reportedly produced similar 'Chameleon'
sightings. There seems to be a trend which involves the infiltration of the
NSA-CIA and the subsequent 'replacement' of agency personnel, and in turn
Military-Industrial personnel, by alien life forms not loyal to planet
earth nor to the human race in general. These reports are very similar to
other reports that made the rounds within 'fringe' research groups during
the early 1980's concerning the reported 'assimilation' of high-ranking
Communist officials and scientists by serpent-like humanoids, reptilian
beings that were reputedly revived out of suspended animation from a frozen
city that was discovered under the northern Siberian ice fields. The was
referred to as the "Siberian Affair". Are their really 'tares' living among
the 'wheat' as all these reports suggest?



Aside from Dulce, New Mexico and the Nevada Test Site, other areas where
these "chameleon" sightings have taken place include Deep Springs, CA where
these alien "impostors" have allegedly been sighted; and Dugway, Utah where
one woman by the name of Barbara who worked as a hair stylist claimed she
saw one of the HIGH RANKING MILITARY OFFICIALS transform temporarily into
an entity with 'reptilian' features. Another source at Dugway who worked in
an auto shop claimed that he saw a similar phenomena while changing the
tires on the car of one Dugway military official. Remember that Dugway
works closely with Area 51, which is just to the west and across the state
border. It is interesting that there are claims that the joint CIA-alien
activity within the 'Dreamland' underground complexes of Nevada have and
are being extended to the underground facilities below the St. George and
Dugway areas of Utah, among other sites.

Another 'sighting' of these impostors occurred just south of the mid-point
of an old toll road that ran between Hopland and Lakeport, California. The
sighting involved large black automobiles that would leave and enter a
dead-end road in the area. When investigated, the tire tracks ran right up
and under a large boulder at the base of a cliff and seemingly disappeared
beneath it, and since the road was fenced on one side and a steep hill
existed on the other, it is unlikely that the large automobiles were able
to turn around. This same area, especially one particular mountain there,
is known as a very unusual place. 'Bottomless' caves with stone stairwells
have been reported. Government vehicles and personnel have 'disappeared'
without a trace on the road. An 'atmosphere of fear' is said to exist in an
area approximately 30 miles in diameter. Also there have been a lot of
unexplained deaths among the settlers in the area. Apparently this area is
the site of a large underground center of 'alien' activity. This activity
was taking place back in the 1930's, long before the so-called ALIEN "Men
In Black" started getting any major attention from Ufologists in America.

The Dulce enigma [and the "chameleons"] have not only infiltrated Utah,
Nevada and California, but seems to have stretched its tentacles all the
way up to the Pacific northwest. One area of particular interest is the
Madigan Military Hospital south of Seattle, Washington near FORT LEWIS...
which has been investigated by Val Valerian. In June of 1992 Valerian
released the following article, titled "ALIEN INFILTRATION OF THE MILITARY
MEDICAL SYSTEM: MADIGAN HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON", in his LEADING EDGE
newsletter:

"About a year ago, we ran into SEVERAL PEOPLE who stated that they 'had
heard' that 'REPTILIAN HUMANOIDS WERE WORKING AT A U.S. ARMY HOSPITAL' NEAR
FORT LEWIS, WASHINGTON. At that point, these statements were simply filed
away in 'rumor' status, pending the arrival of something more substantial.
Descriptions of the nature of and appearance of alien humanoid forms that
could be termed 'REPTILIAN' vary widely. REPTILIAN HUMANOIDS HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED IN ITALY AS LOOKING VERY LIZARD-LIKE, EVEN WITH TAILS. Pictures
showing some of these entities were published in an ITALIAN magazine and
eventually ended up in the United States in 'The Leading Edge'. Logic would
seem to tell us that if alien humanoids were in fact in 'collusion' with
military medical personnel at a hospital, they would not in fact have the
appearance of anything other than humans, or be close enough to humans to
blend in. About a month ago, the nature of synchronicity brought me to an
espresso bar, where I chanced to engage a lady in her early 50's in some
small conversation about an entirely unrelated matter. She had been a nurse
for some twenty years, and sixteen of those twenty years had been spent
working for the U.S. Army. She retired from the service and was now job
hunting in the local area. She was very professional, and seemed to know a
lot about the nursing field.

Gradually, her conversation got around to a 'very unusual place', Madigan
Military Hospital, which is located on Route 5 south of Seattle. She had
applied for work at the hospital and noticed that it was indeed a hospital
unlike any she had ever seen before. Madigan is a brand new $150 million
dollar facility, built about a year or so ago. From her description, there
are small R2D2-type robots that shuttle prescriptions between floors, all
the equipment is prototype 'one-of-a-kind', like laser x-rays and a lot of
equipment that was extremely high tech. It was not this alone which peaked
my interest, but a comment she made later. She made the statement that when
she entered a specific lab in the hospital, she noticed that all the
personnel were extremely absorbed in their work -- nothing too uncommon
about that. But then she stated that she had the thought that some of the
equipment looked quite 'alien', AND TWO MEN WHO LOOKED EXACTLY ALIKE TURNED
AND LOOKED AT HER IN RESPONSE TO HER THOUGHT. She said that THE EYES OF
THESE TWO MEN WERE QUITE PENETRATING AND THAT THEY BOTH MOVED IN UNISON.
That got my interest. She then stated that during the tour of the facility,
the individual who was escorting her said that the top floor of the
hospital AND TWO OF THE SUB-BASEMENT FLOORS were Top Secret R&D areas and
were off limits to BOTH military and civilian personnel. That really got my
attention.

"Subsequently, I ran into a cable repairman who was installing cable TV in
a nearby town, and decided on a hunch to mention to him about the strange
nature of Madigan. The hunch paid off. He said he had been involved in the
installation of fiber optic networks between the floors of the hospital
when it was in its construction stage, and that there was a three foot
space in between the floors where the optics ran.

"Since these observations were the result of her [the nurse's] preliminary
interview, I talked to her about the idea of getting more information,
since she would be going back at least one more time. She agreed to make
some tapes of her observations. The transcript of these tapes is as
follows:

"'VISIT TO MADIGAN HOSPITAL -- The entrance to Madigan hospital is off of
Interstate 5 past Olympia, Washington. The exit is marked as 'Madigan
Hospital, Camp Murray Exit'. As you enter the area the hospital sits to the
right -- a massive white structure. As you enter the parking lot, there is
a pond and sunken area that runs through a bridge which connects the
'medical mall' area to a three story building that serves as the main core
of the hospital, where the services like x-ray, nuclear medicine and other
services are performed.

"'The three story complex is connected to an eight-story tower dubbed 'the
nursing tower.' The tower has a floor that is closed off, and I could find
no access to it.

"'I entered the front of the hospital, and the lobby was very typical, but
not typical of a hospital of this size. I then went to the information desk
and was greeted by an 'oriental' Specialist 4th Class, who was seated. He
seemed very low key and laid back. I was directed to Human Resources.

"'As I walked through the corridors, I noticed how beautiful and calm I was
beginning to feel. The colors are very soft and conducive to feeling mellow
(a 'tranquil-ized' atmosphere designed to negate any apprehensions? -
Branton).

"'The military personnel WERE VERY SLOW-MOVING [which has NOT been my
experience in the past, having served five years as an Army nurse], and LOW
KEY. I went to the Human Resources and asked about an application, and was
directed to a Master Sergeant -- director of personnel.

"'Having been a medical technologist for the better part of 25 years, the
equipment I saw at the hospital was far beyond anything I have ever seen. I
was shown an area where there was a long room with computer banks on both
sides where both civilian and military personnel were working. Before
entering the room, I was asked to stand in front of the door, where I was
scanned by some beam-like light. I was told that my thermal pattern was
being recorded in order to permit my entry to the room.

"'Off this room was another room where procedures were conducted on
patients, and I noticed that a patient walked over and climbed on an exam
table. The procedure they were doing always requires that the patient must
be sedated, HOWEVER I NOTICED THAT THE PHYSICIAN LEANED OVER THE PATIENT
AND TOUCHED THE PATIENT IN THE CENTER OF THE FOREHEAD WITH 'HIS' INDEX AND
MIDDLE FINGER OF ONE HAND. IMMEDIATELY, THE PATIENT FELL INTO A STATE OF
SEDATION AND THE PROCEDURE WAS STARTED. What kind of doctor can touch a
patient in that way and sedate him?

"'I looked around at the other personnel in the room at this time. There
were two, a Private First Class and a Specialist 4th Class at opposite ends
of the room from where I was standing. BOTH OF THESE MEN WERE THE SAME
SIZE, HAD THE SAME SKIN COLOR, AND MOVED IN A VERY DELIBERATE MANNER. I was
talking with the Sergeant and happened to say something to myself very
softly while having the thought how strange these people seemed. BOTH OTHER
MEN TURNED AND LOOKED AT ME ALMOST AS IF TO STARE AT ME. I GOT THIS STRANGE
FEELING. I had heard before from a friend whose brother had made the
uncharacteristic comment that 'ALIENS WORKED AT MADIGAN'. 'ALL' THE PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM AND THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IN GENERAL THAT I HAD SEEN IN THE
HOSPITAL SEEMED TO MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY, ALMOST IN SLOW MOTION. I left the
area and went back to the Sergeant's office.

"'A month later, I returned to Madigan with a friend to see, without
telling her anything of my experience, if she saw and felt the same things
I did. She is very sensitive to variations in electromagnetic fields, and
eventually had a headache and became nauseated. There are many other things
about this place. Between the floors there are spaces where small robots
move to deliver supplies to all the wards and other areas in the hospital,
according to the Sergeant. I was told that there is no reason for personnel
to go into these areas -- that the robots do all that. I did see one of the
robot devices. It looked like the R2D2 character on 'star wars'.

"'My friend and I entered through what is known as the clinic mall. This
area houses the outpatient clinic. THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE THERE FOR
SUCH A LARGE CLINIC. We were told that THERE ARE THREE FLOORS BENEATH THE
HOSPITAL and one floor above that are off limits to ALL PERSONNEL, MILITARY
AND CIVILIAN, and that these areas were classified Top Secret and were
research and development [R&D] areas. THERE ARE VERY UNUSUAL ANTENNAS ON
TOP OF THE HOSPITAL. The three-story main service area has a complex on top
of it THAT APPEARS TO HAVE NO ENTRANCE AND NO WINDOWS. Judging from the way
the hospital is built, there are a lot of 'DEAD AREAS' that comprise spaces
THAT CANNOT BE ACCESSED FROM THE MAIN SERVICE AREA.

"'The personal feeling we both got being in the hospital WAS THAT WE
STARTED TO FEEL VERY DRAINED, AND WE BOTH EXPERIENCED GETTING A DULL
HEADACHE. It wasn't until we had driven SEVERAL MILES from the facility
that we started to feel better.'"



I came across yet another report suggesting that reptiloid entities were
infiltrating our military-industrial complex, however the exact source of
this particular story was not confirmed and therefore should be taken as
is. The report stated that sometime during the 1980's a Secretary working
in the Pentagon noticed a high-ranking Pentagon 'official' who had
apparently lost a contact lens. The eye from where the lens fell out was
NOT human, but instead contained a vertically-slit pupil. No one working at
the Pentagon seemed to know where the official worked although they had
apparently assumed that he was supposed to be there in some capacity or
another. The Secretary however informed her superiors of the strange
incident, and immediately Security Personnel approached the 'officer' who
apparently was not aware of his missing contact lens. The 'man' did not
make any major attempts to resist. When the apartment of this 'official'
was searched, copies of several sensitive documents on the "Star Wars" or
"Strategic Defense Initiative" program were discovered. Apparently the
entity had been stealing the documents and transmitting their contents to
some point beyond the planet. Rumor had it that the entity was physically
examined and it was discovered that its internal organs were NOT human.

In reference to the Draconian interest in our planetary defense net, I pass
on the following information from British UFOlogist Timothy Good, who
described the unfortunate fate of several experts who assisted in the
development of the STAR WARS defense system. Apparently, they were either
eliminated by those they worked for so that they would not reveal what they
knew, or someone or something 'else' that was not pleased with the ultimate
products of their efforts was responsible for their tragic deaths.
Certainly, all of these scientists dying at once cannot be explained in
coincidental terms, whatever the case:

"...Reports of suspicious deaths, darkly and deeply linked to UFO's,
persist, however, and continue to cause speculation. Word comes from Gordon
Creighton, editor of the informative FLYING SAUCER REVIEW, who notes a
possible deathly tie-in with the U.S. 'Star Wars' program. He wrote to me
in Nov. 1988 as follows:

"'...here in Britain 22 scientists have reportedly either taken their own
lives or died in very strange or mysterious circumstances. And it seems
that most... were engaged in British work on behalf of, or related to the
U.S. 'Star Wars' program. The British government, it seems, was trying to
hush it up. But press statements here say that the U.S. government had put
our government on the spot and demanded a full inquiry. So, quite clearly,
it is either the Russians or THEM...'

"As many researchers have surmised, 'Star Wars', ostensibly conceived as a
defensive system against Russian missile attack, may have had from it's
beginning a 'defensive' UFO connection. Whatever the case, a 'mock test' in
September, 1988, of an earth-shattering warhead -- much like 'Star Wars' in
reverse -- was conducted at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. Announced as
a proposed super-weapon designed to destroy 'Russian' underground command
centers dug in solid rock down to 1,000 [feet], some UFO analysts believe
that the real target is not Russian but another adversary deep down in
cavernous installations IN NEVADA AND NEW MEXICO. (Hopefully this weapon
will only be used only against those underground bases where no human
captive presence exists. In those bases where humans captives ARE present,
which is probably the reality in the greater majority of the bases, a
full-scale 'ground assault' should be considered instead. - Branton)

"According to the Pentagon, the proposed earth-penetrating warhead is
'urgently needed'. According to rumor-mills, an alien race -- the 'grays'
-- in their fortified underground laboratories, are genetically
experimenting with the human race. Even more ominous, rumors say that their
intransigence today may lead to new perils tomorrow."



In reference to the "Chameleons" and CERTAIN elements of the so-called "Men
In Black" phenomena, I cannot help but include the following account from
Brazil which apparently puts everything in perspective. The following
excerpts were taken from a report by Brazilian researcher Antonio Huneeus,
titled: "THE 'CHUPAS' -- UFO HORROR STORIES FROM BRAZIL". Mr. Huneeus
describes the following incident that was investigated by APEX [Association
of Extraterrestrial Investigations] in Sao Paulo, one of the best known UFO
groups in Brazil, founded by Dr. Max Berezowsky:

"...The affair began near Vitoria, the capitol of [the] state of Espiritu
Santo north of Rio state, where there are beaches rich in mineral contents.
It happened either in late 1979 or early 1980, [Osni] Schwarz wasn't sure,
when he told the story in 1986...

"A youngster called Aeromar sold beverages at the beach, where one day he
encountered three men dressed with suits and tie -- highly unusual clothing
for the beach, especially in Brazil -- who approached him and said they
wanted to talk to him. Aeromar became scared, thinking they were perhaps
policemen who wanted to implicate him in a drug case, so he avoided the
beach for a few days. As he returned home after dropping off his girlfriend
one night, he saw a car with the same three men inside. He ran to the
house, but suddenly he couldn't hear well. His mother took him to the
hospital where he was not cured, although about a month later he suddenly
could hear well again.

"Aeromar moved to Rio, finding work at a bakery in a shift between 4 and 11
PM. One night, as he was crossing one of the many TUNNELS that link the Rio
bays, he saw two of the MIB's walking in his direction. The youngster ran
in the opposite direction, only to find the third MIB waiting at a bus
stop. He escaped and went back to the bakery, where he told his boss that
the Vitoria police were chasing him. The boss accompanied him to the
nearest police station to make a complaint, which he did, but he was not
believed. The boss then convinced him that he should perhaps move to Sao
Paulo, a bigger city where it may be easier to go unnoticed.

"So Aeromar moved to Sao Paulo, finding work in an electrical company and
sharing a room with another man. He also became friends with a vendor of
beverages from Vitoria who had a stand near a movie theater. While hanging
out there one night, a car stopped right in front of the stand and the door
opened.

"Even through he didn't want to go, Aeromar LOST HIS WILL and entered the
car. The door closed and he found inside -- not surprisingly -- the three
same men whom he had been dodging for months. They drove for a while,
leaving the city and entering a wooded area.

"The car stopped and they all walked up to a big UFO surrounded by some
sort of luminous ring and hovering above the ground. The men walked
underneath the craft, which emitted a ray of light and they suddenly were
inside. Still drained of any willpower, Aeromar walked to a chair and sat
down. From the arms of the chair appeared handles that secured his wrists.
An iron bar then pressed his forehead backwards while another gadget
fastened his neck. Up to here the men were always dressed with suits, but
at this point an incredible transformation took place: the MIB'S HEAD
RIPPED OPENED INTO A HEART SHAPE AND THE SKIN BECAME GREEN AND SCALED LIKE
A REPTILIAN. Take into account that while the popular image of the MIB was
well known 14 years ago, the idea of reptilian abductors was then not in
vogue as nowadays.

"Be that as it may, the UFOnauts proceeded to interrogate and tell him
things that were going to happen both to him and the earth. To make the
story even more 'Hollywoodesque', a door in the room opened at one point
and Aeromar was able to peek at HUMAN CORPSES HANGING BY THEIR FEET FROM
HOOKS. The man naturally became traumatized, remembering only that his
straps were loosened. Everything went blank after that...

"Aeromar's conscious recollection places him next back at the theater, but
several hours later since there was no traffic in the streets. He returned
to his room in panic and began to tell the story to his roommate. A strange
force PUSHED HIS BODY, however, throwing it AGAINST THE WALL in front of
him, as he remembered the aliens had told him that he shouldn't speak about
the experience or he would suffer. Aeromar cried for a while, not knowing
what to do. A few days later, his friend contacted the Globo TV network,
which was working on a UFO documentary. Globo, in turn, passed the tip to
Dr. Max Berezowsky. Aeromar and his roommate went to APEX on a very busy
day when the office was full of people. They told the whole story to Dr.
Berezowsky and a few assistants, Osni Schwarz among them.

"Berezowsky attempted to do hypnotic regression with the witness, but there
was too much interference in the office and Aeromar was in total panic. He
was saying that 'they' were going to take him on the next Thursday and that
a UFO was going to land in a Sao Paulo neighborhood on Tuesday night. A
crowd of people, in fact, went that night to the supposed landing site but
nothing happened. Although Dr. Berezowsky was in touch with Aeromar, HE
VANISHED A FEW DAYS LATER AND NOBODY EVER SAW HIM AGAIN. I wrote down at
the end of my notes on this affair, 'the whole case is like a UFO horror
movie.'"
