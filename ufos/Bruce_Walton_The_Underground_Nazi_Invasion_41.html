 [PART 41]

On Oct. 20, 1991, California researcher Michael Lindemann,
founder of 'The 20/20 Group', gave a lecture before a large crowd
of interested investigators.  During the course of the lengthy 
address, Lindemann revealed the following information:

     "...In our conversation today I use [the term] 'government'.  We 
speak of the government as if it is a single thing.  It is hardly that.  
It is actually a hodge-podge [of] power-struggling people, but I would 
like to break it up into two main categories, and that is: 1) The govern-
ment that we consider to be our duly constituted, our elected and 
appointed representatives who attempt as best they can to run a 
semblance of order or federal government which follows the dictates 
of the constitution of the United States.  The constitution is, after all, 
a darn good piece of paper, it is one of the best ever written... If only 
our government were capable of behaving in even [a] resemblance of 
what is intended in the constitution, probably few of us would have a 
great deal to gripe about...
     "Now that they've failed to do that is not only because they are 
fallible humans, but also because they are undermined by another 
'government'.  There is indeed another government operating and that 
government has immense power and operates primarily behind the 
scenes.  And some other researchers have called it the 'secret 
government', some have called it the 'high cabal'.  And it is a group 
of people, a very elite group, non-elected, self-appointed people who 
guide the evolution of (government) policy from behind the scenes.  
These are people who transcend partisan politics, indeed who trans-
cend the rule of law, and have n thought whatsoever toward the dictates 
of the constitution.
     "These are people who regard themselves as the only true guardians 
or crafters of geo-political reality.  And they regard us, indeed they regard 
elected officials as 'mere mortals'.  These people are the self-appointed 
'OLYMPIANS'.  They have done many things in the name of an agenda 
which is their own, that we would consider appalling and reprehensible.  
Indeed things that are criminal, but they're more than criminal because 
they have sapped and usurped the rights and privileges and the possibi-
lities of our future.  These people are running a king of 'end game' right 
now.  They are trying to determine how 'they' will survive the end time.  
Whether that end time comes as a kind of biblical apocalypse or... as 
the catastrophic collapse of the environment... the (so-called) 'population 
bomb' and all the other things.. whether it comes as a collapse of the 
banking-system which looks to be only days away, or the collapse of 
the rest of the world's economy -- there are many things that could
get us.
     "And these people in effect are building their own version of 'Noah's 
Ark'.  And that 'Noah's Ark' they're building is underground.  Underground 
bases, indeed all over the world, but particularly here in the United States.  
Huge underground bases that have actually festooned the underground 
geography of our continent in a way that would probably stun and shock 
you.  But they even have an underground government, because you see 
when the government topside is no longer functional because a nuclear
bomb lands on Capital Hill, or whether it comes simply because the 
chaos has reached a point where they must abandon ship, there is 
preparation as there has been for decades for continuity of government, 
all the computers, all the personnel are currently in place and operating 
around the clock.  Yes, they are there friends, we have another govern-
ment in waiting, a government that you never authorized, that you never 
said we would pay for, that has cost a CALLOSAL FORTUNE, but it's 
there underground, ready to take over.  And indeed, here in our area, I 
have focused on the Lancaster (CA) area as an example of one of the 
many... but even in Lancaster in particular, we know for certain are 
huge underground bases.  These are not only places where incredible
research is underway but also places where people will go to live when 
the 'bleep hits the blades' as they say.  And, these are places that are 
capable of supporting on an ongoing basis some tens of thousands of 
people.  And so across the country it may be possible to 'save' an 'elect' 
remnant of some hundreds of thousands of people who will be the 'cream' 
of the civilization that is meant to survive the apocalypse or the downfall... 
or whatever it is that's out there getting us.  'Mere mortals' will have to 
fend for themselves.  The expectation is, part of the end game is, (that 
those on the surface) will eventually fight each other into a draw or will 
die of exhaustion or starvation or brutality.  And that eventually the 'mere 
mortals' will (destroy) themselves and rid the world of excess population, 
so that the 'cream', the 'remnant' will come forward and claim their 'right-
ful' place... I must say that there is an immense amount of evidence 
which does support this exact scenario.
     "...There is this government that has [been] playing an 'end game'.  
A government that has an agenda of concealment and control, that is 
operated by terror.  In Lancaster, that agenda of concealment and control 
is what I call the 'Lancaster Syndrome'.  It produces strange distortions 
in many peoples lives...
     "First let me tell you about a man who sits today in Pierce County 
jail outside of Tacoma, Washington.  This man's name is Michael Rico-
nosciuto."
     Lindemann states that Riconosciuto formerly worked for a corpora-
tion called Wackenhut which provides special security protection for 
high-security areas such as the Nevada Test Site.  Michael Riconosciuto 
claims that the real reason he was sent to jail was because he swore 
out an affidavit against the Dept. of Justice.  In that affidavit he explained 
that the U.S. Dept of Justice had 'swindled' the private company INSLAW 
out of a proprietary software called PROMIS.  This software was a data-
base designed to track special groups of people according to various
characteristics.  It was a very powerful, very capable database.  INSLAW 
developed this in the early 1980's and took it to the Dept. of Justice think-
ing it would be a good law enforcement software.  The Dept. of Justice 
would be most useful in helping to track terrorists and other trouble-
makers.  They realized that if they could get control of the software, 
according to Michael Riconosciuto, they could sell it to other countries 
and make huge profits.
     "So the Dept. of Justice allegedly made a deal with the INSLAW 
Corp. for an exclusive on the PROMIS software, and then they drove 
INSLAW into bankruptcy by refusing to pay.  Lindemann continues:
     "The amazing thing is that they were caught.  And in 1988 BARONS 
magazine [the] April 4th (1991) issue... contained this fairly astonishing 
piece of news: 'Presiding judge in the bankruptcy hearing was judge 
George Basing.'  According to BARONS, Judge Basing had found that 
the justice dept. had personally propelled INSLAW into bankruptcy in 
an effort to steal it's PROMIS software through 'Trickery, deceit and fraud.'  
On Feb. 2, 1988, Basing ordered the justice dept. to pay INSLAW about 
6.8 million dollars (no doubt a fee that would ultimately be picked up by 
the friendly American taxpayer. - Wol.).  He postponed at that time a 
decision on punitive damages which could run as high as $25,000,000.  
And as it happens, all of that is all in appeal.  The justice dept. was not 
at all pleased with that ruling.  It does state that justice is in a sorry 
state in America.  If you didn't know that already, I hope this helps you 
to understand."
     Michael was responsible for doing the modifications on the PROMIS 
software before selling that software to the Canadian government after it 
was 'stolen' from INSLAW, and so he had an inside track on this infor-
mation.
     "He explained," Lindemann continues, "that the Dept. of Justice, 
among other things, prevailed on him in Feb. of this year (1991) not to 
offer his information in the ongoing lawsuit.  One Dept. of Justice official 
by the name of Peter Videnicks stated that if he would cooperate with 
this request they could promise him certain benefits..." including an 
assurance given by a Dept. of Justice employee of a favorable outcome 
in a prolonged custody battle between Michael Riconosciuto and his 
ex-wife.  According to Michael Riconosciuto the Dept., of Justice 
"'...also outlined specific punishments that I could expect to receive... 
if I did cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee!'
     "Now this is just an indicator," Lindemann states, "that the Dept. 
of Justice definitely has it's own idea of the meaning of 'justice'."
     Michael Riconosciuto went ahead and swore out an affidavit
against the Justice Dept. alleging grand larceny against the INSLAW 
Corp.  Lindemann stated that none of the threatened punishments ever 
came about as they found an easier way to frame him, "that is, they 
busted (framed) him for drugs, and now he sits facing a possible life 
sentence in the Pierce Co. Jail.  But because of that he's very, very 
scared because he knows now that these guys will take-him-out when-
ever they darn well feel like it.  And so he's talking, he's talking in every 
way he can... In particular we wanted to ask Michael Riconosciuto 
something about some of the things going on at the underground bases.  
I'd like to read you just a little bit of what Michael Riconosciuto told 
us recently about that.  I asked him, what did he know about the under-
ground bases in the Lancaster area.  I'm going to quote now our conver-
sation:
     "He said, 'Well, there's extensive stuff in... I call it the 'Edwards 
position', and then at Nellis over in Nevada, and at the Nevada Test Site.'  
Then he went on to say, 'Last summer I had a group of guys bagging a 
whole bunch of files and records, and some equipment out of Wackenhut 
and they had a helicopter loaded to the nuts and they got shot down 
before they could get out of there.'
     "I don't know how many of you noticed,' Lindemann continues, "but 
there was an article in the LOS ANGELES TIMES, the 24th of July of 
this year -- FATAL COPTER CRASH AT THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE
PROBED.  This was the most serious accident which had ever occurred 
in the history of the Test Site.  Five people were killed when this helicopter 
went down, and the FAA and the DOE and the National Transportation 
and safety board all converged on the Nuclear Test Site to figure out what 
brought this copter down.  But you may be ASSURED that they will never 
tell you because it was SHOT down by Wackenhut, and it contained 
two pilots and 3 Wackenhut personnel according to the article in the
L.A. TIMES.
     "I said, 'I heard about that.  Are you saying that that was a group of, 
let's say, renegades from the inside who were trying to bolt for the blue 
and WACKENHUT shot them down?  Is that your allegation?'  And he 
said,
     "'Yep!'
     "And I said, 'Is there anything more that you can say about this?'  
He said:
     "'Not on the phone.'
     "I said, 'Were you aware of that before it happened?'
     "He said, 'Yes.  I told a handful of people that we were hoping to get 
a big stash of stuff out of there.'
     "I said, 'Were they trying to get out of Nellis?'
     "He said, 'No, not Nellis, off the Nuclear Test Site.'
     "And the information they were trying to get out, what did it pertain to?'
     "And he said, 'Guess!  I don't even want to talk about it.  The worst!'
     "And I said, 'The very worst. hugh?'
     "And he said, 'yep'.
     "Now I don't know of the 'very worst,' do you?  I mean I'm not really 
sure, but it seemed to me, judging from other things that we had talked 
with Mike about and some of the other things that we've heard from 
witnesses in the underground bases... the 'very worst' could be one of 
two main possibilities in my book... The very worst #1) -- Really nasty, 
scary alien stuff (real aliens, biogenetic creations, or both? - Wol.).  The 
very worst #2) -- Really nasty, scary bio-tech... bio-engineering stuff.  
There's all kinds of genetic engineering, some of which has to do with 
the 'creation' of biological warfare agents, some of which has to do with 
the 'creation' of strange bacteria, and perhaps new strains of chimpanzees 
and (perhaps) people.  There are very, very weird experiments going on, 
and I thought, 'O.K., fine, maybe one or the other of those things.'
     "But our conversation continued and it leaned in one direction so let's 
just see what he had to say next.
     "I said, 'One of your associates seemed to indicate that there was 
technology operating that would have the appearance of flying saucers, 
but be absolutely terrestrial.  Can you comment on that?'
     "And he said, 'Sure, we had some propulsion devices that were, let's 
say, rather astounding.'
     "I said, 'Is this stuff operational?'  And he said 'Oh, yes, it's opera-
tional.'
     "I said, 'O.K., so there are vehicles.  Would you say that they belonged 
in the arsenal, or are they part of a sort of gee-whiz lunatic fringe of science?'
     "And he said, 'Oh no, they're part of the arsenal.  It's not lunatic fringe 
stuff, it's all well-funded, it's all very real.  I've worked on portions of it, I've 
worked on teams that have worked on this stuff, and I've seen with my own 
eyes...  
    "And I said to him, '...I get the impression that you assume that there 
are extraterrestrials ['aliens'] around.'
     "And he said, 'I have no direct knowledge of that, O.K.?  That's all.  
There's alot of strange technology, there's alot of extra-heavy security, O.K.?  
Anybody who breeches a certain point of security is instantly dead or dis-
appears.
     "I said, 'Are you saying that given all the other indiscretions you've shown 
over the years, that this one would be worst?'
     "And he said, 'Yes, I would say so.'
     "I said, 'really?'
     "He said.  'Yes, Yes!  It's like those people who were leaving the Nuclear 
Test Site, they were summarily blown out of the sky.'
     "Now, Michael knew (he was talking on a prison telephone -- his phone 
was tapped) indeed, that people who talk too loud, in too much detail about 
the actual 'alien' situation [again, whether the aliens are real, or a result of 
the biogenetic experiments, or both. - Wol.] are liable to run into severe 
problems.  Being that he's already in prison and a sitting duck, he's obviously 
very careful with his words.  But we have talked with some other people who 
have been more forthright about what they have actually seen in the under-
ground bases...
    "Now you see, the underground installations are built just like a building 
is built.  You know, you've got to do electrical conduit, you've got to paint 
the walls!
     "...There's a facility called Haystack Butte, it's on the Edwards (AFB) 
reservation... (Note: At this point Lindemann shows the audience a map of 
the area encompassing Edwards AFB, the city of Lancaster and Palmdale 
to the south -- which is the sight of 542 where the B-2 bomber is assembled 
and alot of other secret aircraft.  All of the major aircraft and aerospace 
companies are located in this area, among other places.  It also showed 
the Tahachapi facility west of Lancaster, nicknamed the 'Ant Hill', which is 
administered by Northrup and which is rumored by some to house under-
ground hangers for wingless aircraft built by the Secret-Government-Military-
Industrial establishment.  In the southeast corner of Lindemann's map the 
Tejon ranch was visible, which is a large cattle ranch that goes up into the 
Tahachapi range to the southeast of Bakersfield, California.  He also pointed 
out an extensive underground facility maintained by MacDonnell Douglas, 
and the Helendale Facility administered by Lockheed.  In this same general 
area is Haystack Butte which is 'jointly' administered, with North American 
Rockwell involved as well. - Wol.).
     "So what we have here is a situation where you've got our major aero-
space companies heavily implicated.  I mean this is what is meant by the 
Military-Industrial Complex.  These companies are HEAVILY implicated 
in super, super secret projects, and at the very top they're all cooperating 
together.  All the 'bidding wars' and every thing that you see are like mid-
level smoke and mirrors.  But at the very top we're talking about projects 
that are conducted by all these different people pooling their resources, 
pooling their information, and indeed pooling their money, which comes in 
incredible profusion from the Black Budget.
     "How many of you have seen the book 'BLANK CHECK'?... I strongly 
recommend that you read the book 'BLANK CHECK' so that you can under-
stand something about how these projects are funded without your sayso, 
indeed without the sayso of Congress.  Most citizens don't know for example 
that the National Security Act of 1947 made it illegal to ever say how much 
money is spent on the CIA.  Indeed all of our tremendous alphabet soup 
collection of Intelligence Agencies.  Whether your talking about the CIA, or 
the NRO, or the NSA or the DIA, etc., all of them are in the same category.
     "You cannot say how much these things cost.  All you can do if you 
want to find out is add-up the numbers on the Budget that aren't assigned 
to anything that actually means anything.  There are these huge categories 
that have tens of billions of dollars in them that say nothing but 'Special
Projects...'  And every year the Congress dutifully passes this bloated 
budget that has some $300,000,000,000 or more with HUGE chunks of 
cash labeled like that: 'Special Projects,' 'Unusual Stuff.' -- Ten billion dollars.  
O.K., well where does the 'unusual stuff' money go?  Well, it DOES go to 
'unusual stuff', that's for sure, and one of the places it goes is that it goes
into the underground bases.  Indeed TIM said recently since the publication 
of his book (BLANK CHECK)... MORE BLACK BUDGET MONEY goes into 
underground bases than ANY OTHER kind of work. 
     "Now I don't believe that 35 billion, which is the approximate size of the 
black budget money that you can find by 'analyzing' the budget, I don't think 
that comes CLOSE to the real figure because there is absolutely unequivocal 
evidence that a great deal of additional money was generated in other ways, 
such as the surreptitious running of guns and drugs.  And one wonderful 
example of that is coming to light with the B.C.C.I. scandal which I hope 
you've heard of... a number of very high-ranking American officials are caught 
in the undertow of the BCCI tidal wave... Even though these guys are tying to 
pull 'fast ones' on an immense scale they are getting caught.  These things
don't always work.  Indeed they are very, very vulnerable.
     Indeed this whole 'end game' is very vulnerable and that's why they feel 
it requires such secrecy.  The American people wouldn't stand for this stuff 
if they had the information, and that's the reason why we have to get the 
information out and take it seriously because it really is a matter of our 
money and our future that's being mortgaged here.
     "[...A] friend who worked in the underground bases, who was doing 
sheetrock was down on, he thinks, approximately the 30th level underground 
[implied that] these bases are perhaps 30-35 stories deep.  As I say they 
are not just mine shafts, these are huge, giant facilities... many city blocks 
in circumference, able to house tens of thousands of people.  One of them, 
the YANO Facility (we're told... by the county fire dept. director, the county 
fire dept. chief who had to go in there to look at a minor fire infraction) there's 
a 400-car parking lot on the 1st level of the YANO Facility, but cars never 
come in and out, those are the cars that they use INSIDE.  (A related item
surfaced in the initial few hours following the explosion at the Federal Build-
ing in Oklahoma City.  Local reporters were told by Firefighters of "huge 
tunnels" that had been blasted open by the blast(s?), which were filled with 
tanks, weapons, missiles and other military equipment.  Initial reports spoke 
of an underground facility below the building that was/is 18 levels deep, with 
the top five levels alone being reserved for parking.  These reports never made
it to the national news, and even the few local news outlets that reported it
said nothing more after the initial shock had run its course.  All of this is 
interesting when we consider that several reports have revealed that FEMA 
utilizes several deep underground bases throughout the country, with head-
quarters within the underground Mt. Weather facility near Blumont, VA.  
Oklahoma City is supposed to be one of the central FEMA 'processing 
centers' for 'dissidents' if and when National Emergency measures are 
implemented and Martial Law is enforced. - Wol.)
     "...There's a disturbing pattern of people dying however when they see 
things they're not supposed to... Michael Riconosciuto makes it very clear 
in his statement to us that if you go past a certain point your dead or dis-
appear, just like that.  We've heard that time and time again.  Indeed there 
are a great many people on the 'inside' who are making it clear that they 
would love to flee, people like these people that apparently were blown out 
of the sky, the Wackenhut garbage.  These are trained (mercenaries) who 
have seen things they cannot stand, things that turn their stomach, things 
that make them want to grab evidence and flee for their lives.  And they were 
blown out of the sky, probably by something equivalent to a stinger missile 
or something like that.  And there are lots of people who want to get out.
     "Just an example of the way these people talk, one of them said to us, 
'I would trade my $100,000.00 a year salary for a job at McDonald's if I 
could get out alive.  There's a certain despair there, a certain feeling of 
entrapment.  You see there are the people who know what's going on and 
who have created this agenda and have 'bought-into' it entirely, they are 
enrolled in it, and they believe that they are indeed the 'Olympians'.  They
have to employ lots of normal humans like us to do the sheetrocking, to do 
the grubwork, and those people are in a very bizarre catch-22, because they 
are given the promise of a salary that they never believed possible.  You 
know... they're going to paint walls all day and they're going to take down a 
hundred grand a year, this is unusual.  That's the up-side of the deal.  The 
down side of the deal is (you know, and they make it very clear)... all these 
people who get these high security clearances are subjected to INCREDIBLY 
intimidating indoctrination and intimidation processes... they really do subject 
these people to tremendous pressure, tremendous intimidation, indeed they 
do inflict great violence on people (on whom) they 'need' to.  They make 
'examples' of people..."
