 Earth Island Journal, Fall 94: ARCO, Eastlund and the Roots of HAARP -- by
                                Gary Smith:

(Note: Following is an interesting by-product of ARCO [the Atlantic
Richfield Co.,] which has been getting a good deal of attention throughout
Internet discussion groups. Could such a powerful project be used 'against'
American citizens by ARCO or other proponents of the 'New World Order'? -
Branton)

All atomic and electronic technologies -- from household appliances to
nuclear weapons -- radiate energetic particles. While the immediate impacts
of human-caused electromagnetic pollution are generally imperceptible, the
long-term consequences for the biosphere can be profound.

In 1988, OMNI magazine raised concerns about the environmental consequences
of a bizarre electromagnetic invention. According to OMNI, ARCO, the US oil
giant, found itself wondering what to do with the estimated 30 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas that it hoped to extract from Alaska's North
Slope. While this was enough energy to supply the US for a year, the gas
fields were too far from any potential customers. ARCO concluded that it
would be too expensive to liquefy the gas and ship it thousands of miles to
urban centers. What was needed was a client that wanted access to vast
amounts of energy on-site -- in the wilds of Alaska.

Bernard Eastland, an MIT and Columbia University physicist with eight years
experience with the Atomic Energy Commission, came to the rescue with an
extraordinary plan to use the energy "at the point of production."

Eastland, who soon became president of ARCO's Production Technologies
International Company in Houston, proposed burning the vast Alaskan gas
fields to power a huge electric generator. The resulting power would be
directed into a huge antenna complex, 40 miles on a side. The antennae
would be used to focus an intense beam of electromagnetic energy into the
upper atmosphere where it would collide with the ionosphere to create a
phenomenon called the "mirror force." Eastland was granted a US Patent (#
4,686,605) for this invention on August 11, 1987.

"You can virtually lift part of the upper atmosphere," Eastland told OMNI,
"You can make it move, do things to it." One of the tricks Eastland
envisioned involved 'surgically' distorting the ionosphere to disrupt
global communications. Pushing the upper atmosphere around might also
generate high-altitude 'drag' that could heat and deflect enemy missiles or
surround them with "high-energy electrons" that might cause the missiles to
detonate in mid-trajectory.

The proposal appealed to the Pentagon, which invested several hundred
thousand dollars 'evaluating' Eastland's work. Eastland maintained that
there were 'peaceful' uses for his technology. In one scenario, he
explained how beams of electromagnetic power could lift portions of the
upper atmosphere and redirect the jetstream to alter global weather
patterns. Using "plumes of atmospheric particles to act as a lens or
focusing device," Eastland proposed redirecting sunlight and heat to
different parts of the Earth's surface, making it possible to manipulate
wind patterns, cause rainstorms in Ethiopia, drive hurricanes out of the
Caribbean, incinerate airborne industrial pollution and sew up the hole in
the Antarctic ozone layer.

"Because the upper atmosphere is extremely sensitive to small changes in
its composition," OMNI cautioned, "merely TESTING an Eastland Device could
cause irreversible damage."

And also we have the following article, titled "DOOMSDAY DEATH RAY".
Subtitle: "Is the U.S. Government Testing a Secret Mega-Weapon?" -- by
"Agent X"., The Nose Magazine, issue #26 [March 1995]. We have to ask
ourselves, just WHO will have control of this 'weapon', especially if ARCO
is deeply involved with the HAARP project? Beginning some ways into the
article:

In marked contrast to other advanced weapons-related programs, HAARP is not
part of the officially denied 'Blackworld' budget. Rather, the military
insists that HAARP is a strictly scientific program to study the aurora
borealis [or Northern Lights], when in fact it is a device intended to
seriously tweak the ionosphere for purposes that are less than benign.
...BUILT by ARCO Power Technologies, HAARP is due to begin initial testing
as this story goes to press. During 1996, a planned $75 million increase to
the already multi megabuck project will increase the output of the system
to over 1.7 gigawatts, making HAARP the most powerful emitter in the world.
Several smaller sites exist around the world, most notably in Russia.
Though these installations cannot match the ionosphere heating capabilities
of HAARP, some experts in the field who wish not to be quoted suggest that
some aberrant weather conditions MAY HAVE been caused by their operation.
The weapon-development whiz kids have been interested in this sort of gizmo
for quite some time. Just what in hell does the military want with the
world's largest weenie roaster? Here are some possible applications I've
discovered:

EARTH-PENETRATING TOPOGRAPHY: Sort of a CAT scan for the planet. By heating
the ionosphere to create a resonant mirror, electronic-beam steering
directs an energy stream to specific coordinates on the planet. This energy
penetrates the ground to a depth of a kilometer or more, and the signal
return is received by satellite or aircraft. After computer processing, A
RELATIVELY CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT IS UNDERGROUND emerges. Damn handy when
trying to figure out where those wily North Koreans hide their nukes -- or
where YOU keep your stash.

HARD-KILL WEAPON SYSTEM: The output of HAARP would have to be boosted a
thousand-fold, but if that is accomplished, a shell of high-speed electrons
can be constructed that encompasses the earth. Any ballistic missile or
warhead passing through the shell would explode.

SOFT-KILL WEAPON SYSTEM: By directing enormous amounts of radio-frequency
energy at a specific area, HAARP could overload electrical power
distribution grids, fry sensitive microelectronics, detonate weapons that
use electronic fuses, scramble missile guidance systems and probably upset
brain chemistry.

WEATHER MODIFICATION: Heating the upper atmosphere over specific areas
could change weather patterns, creating torrential floods, destroying an
enemy's infrastructure or denying an enemy's harvest by drought... Weather
as a weapon.
IDENTIFICATION OF SATELLITES: By illuminating orbiting spacecraft with
HAARP, the constituent materials and the mission of a satellite can be
assessed.

COMMUNICATIONS: Possible uses include satellite jamming, satellite
communications with submarines and detection of stealth aircraft.

Physicist Bernard Eastlund, president of Production Technologies Company
AND FORMER 'ARCO' BIGWIG, was granted three patents over the past seven
years for a system that looks suspiciously like HAARP - though much larger.
His plan, using a transmitter encompassing 160 square miles and powered by
massive amounts of electricity generated using vast Alaskan natural gas
reserves [to which ARCO has access], was to shoot down missiles and alter
the weather. ARCO initially owned Eastlund's patents, but was soon paid a
visit by Edward Teller (the "father of the H-Bomb", Nevada Test Site
coordinator for the "Star Wars" or SDI defense program, and major MJ-12
member. - Branton.), and development grew secretive. Eastlund declined
further involvement, and the patents were quietly sold in June 1994 to
E-Systems, a high-tech corporation famous for ultra-secret defense projects
such as the president's customized Boeing 747 doomsday plane.

"HAARP is the perfect first step towards a plan like mine," Eastlund says.
"Advances in phased-array transmitter technology and power generation can
produce the field strength required. The government will say it isn't so,
but if it quacks like a duck and it looks like a duck, there's a good
chance it is duck."

"Eastlund is nuts," says an Air Force official speaking on condition of
anonymity. "HAARP is much smaller and less powerful than his instrument. We
are not doing anything except good science and pure research.

"The real beauty of HAARP," he then adds cryptically, "is that nothing you
can see on the outside is sensitive. The secret is the beam steering
agility and pulsing of the transmissions... When covert operations occur,
the science team, the operating funds and the mission will be black."

Whatever is going on, Alaskans are mad as hell. The federal government
enjoys a long tradition of screwing over the inhabitants of the Last
Frontier. Generally speaking, the feds are as welcome as a case of herpes.
And studies done by the EPA, the Swedish government and others indicate
that HAARP could interfere with communications, navigation systems,
wildlife migration and possibly human health.

"There has never been a transmitter of this power in this frequency,"
Eastlund says. "It would be wise to assess its impact."
Though there are many questions, the military insists that all is well and
there is nothing to worry about.

"We are not doing anything to the ionosphere -- we are just looking at it,"
insists Air Force Phillips Laboratory spokesman Roy Heitman.

Although an ad-hoc grassroots organization called NO HAARP is trying to
stop the project, founder Clare Zickuhr admits, "It's all a whitewash,
[HAARP] is going to happen." An ARCO retiree, Zickuhr is convinced HAARP is
a secret weapons project. "It has all the appearances of a secret program.
This is not good science -- they have no idea what this thing could do to
the ionosphere. To put this in the hands of the military scares the hell
out of me."

(Remember however that, although this particular ex-ARCO employee - Zickuhr
-- is against the project, the HAARP facility in Alaska was never-the-less
CONSTRUCTED by ARCO POWER TECHNOLOGIES. So Zickuhr's views apparently do
not reflect the views of ARCO in general in regards to the project. -

And if you're not yet convinced that ARCO -- The ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY
-- is a front for the fascist "Nazifeller" New World Order infiltration of,
if not invasion of, North America, then try this one on for size:

ARCO-ALYESKA, WACKINHUT, ILLEGAL SPYING, ORGANIZED CRIME... ("Oh what a
tangled web we weave..."):

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE GEORGE MILLER CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTERIOR AND
INSULAR AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON ALYESKA COVERT OPERATIONS
NOVEMBER 4, 1991

(A few excerpts from this lengthy hearing appear below - Branton):

"This is the first of two days of hearings before the House Interior
Committee on the subject of covert surveillance authorized by the Alyeska
Pipeline Service Company and conducted by The WACKENHUT Corporation. "On
August 7 of this year, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs filed
a written request for documents from Wackenhut and Alyeska in connection
with allegations that the Wackenhut Corporation conducted undercover
surveillance of Charles Hamel on behalf of Alyeska and its OWNER companies.
In letters to both Wackenhut and Alyeska, I expressed concern that the
surveillance of Mr. Hamel was for the purpose of obtaining information on
and/or interfering with Mr. Hamel's communications with this Committee.
"Charles Hamel has been a source of information for Congress, state and
federal regulatory agencies, and the media, concerning environmental,
health and safety VIOLATIONS by Alyeska and its oil company owners (that
is, ARCO or Atlantic Richfield. - Branton). Mr. Hamel has served as a
conduit for whistleblowers, including Alyeska employees, to make public
information on oil industry practices. At the same time, Mr. Hamel has at
least two significant business disputes with ALYESKA and EXXON... "In the
next two days, we will explore the issue of whether Alyeska's use of a
'bogus' environmental group formed by Wackenhut spies was an effort to
disrupt and compromise a source of information for this Committee's
continuing investigation of oil industry practices in Alaska... "In my
view, it is important to find out why some of the largest and most powerful
corporations in this country would resort to such elaborate 'sting' tactics
to INVADE and DESTROY the privacy of Mr. Hamel, federal and state
officials, environmentalists and ordinary citizens... "We believe that the
testimony and the evidence presented in these hearings during the next two
days will show that the covert surveillance operation involved the much
more sinister and disturbing motives of SILENCING environmental critics and
intimidating whistleblowers..."
