don't flame me for "violating national security!!!" It discusses the "Aurora"
spy plane, military "black" budgets, and even includes neutron beam weapons!!


This is a follow-up to previous messages I had posted on the subject of
the "Aurora" hypersonic spy plane and the Dept. of Defense's "black" budget.
In an earlier posting I mentioned that Item #15 in the Defense Critical
Technologies Plan was for "pulsed power". This was based on a one-page summary
in Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine, p. 57, May 20, 1991. I had
assumed that "pulsed power" referred to the pulsating engines of "Aurora"
I tried to get the document in question, for 1992, as mentioned in the article.
I guess the local document depository has a limited budget, because they didn't
have it. However, I did read the Defense Critical Technologies Plan for fiscal
year '91 (DOD document # AD-A219 300). Item #15 (Pulsed Power) describes
high-energy weapons including rail guns (electromagnetic launchers in DOD
terminology) and neutral particle beams (which I had thought were impossible).
But back to "Aurora" - Item #14 in the Defense Critical Technologies Plan
describes air-breathing propulsion systems and includes this remark on page
A-154 : "Hypersonic aircraft have the potential to enhance military capability
to make high-speed intercepts and timely reconnaissance. Hypersonic
air-breathing technology is the second highest priority effort in this area."

To get more of a feel for how "black" programs operate, I read several reports
prepared by the House Armed Services Committee about defense procurement, the
Navy's cancelled A-12 Stealth fighter (the drawing of it looks like a two-man
flying pizza slice), and the B-2 Stealth fighter (which indicated that key
members of Congress knew a good deal and appear to have supported it because
subcontracts were given in 46 states and affected 383 Congressional districts).
Unfortunately a lot of the testimony had phrases like "we can't discuss that
in open session, we'll have to talk about it in the vault at the top of the
Capitol" particularly when discussing how the B-2 wasn't as stealthy as it was
supposed to be. Reading the budget documents shows me that the aerospace press
may be mistaken in identifying "Aurora" as "Senior Citizen". According to the
'93 budget, "Senior Citizen" is listed as a tactical aircraft (presumably the
TR-3A) while another project (under intelligence funding) describes "Senior
Year" operations. So, "Aurora" may actually be "Senior Year"

Without further adieu, here's a list of really secret Defense research &
development programs taken from the National Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 1993 (House of Representatives Report 102-527). I bet you could
have all sorts of fun asking military types what these things are at a cocktail
party... Note: code names such as "Senior Citizen" are given in quotes.

Now that I have budget info, I will try and work backwards through the budget
to get a ballpark cost for these programs. As can be seen above, the Air Force
is the worst offender for hiding their programs, with the Navy only hiding
the cost of programs that need to be really secret. Now, I have some material
to put together a FOIA request as a taxpayer!!
