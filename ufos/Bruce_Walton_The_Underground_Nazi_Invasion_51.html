                   The making and unmaking of a Neo-Nazi

Fuhrer-Ex: Memoirs of a former Neo-Nazi
By Ingo Hasselbach with Tom Reiss
Random House, 388 pages, $24

Some would relegate neo-Nazis to a loathsome, but relatively small and
ineffectualfar-right fringe group. They might urge: worry about the real
terrorist groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) [Irish ROMAN Army?
- Wol.] or the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas who continue to wreak deadly
havoc around the world.
Overlooked is the fact that German neo-Nazis have menaced and killed
refugeeson their soil, and the intriguing possibility of a neo-Nazi link in
the devastating 1995 Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing. Defendant
Timothy McVeigh's lawyer has traveled to London to investigate whether
British neo-Nazis contributed bomb components. [The Jewish Review. March
15, 1996]
Even if no such international conspiracy is uncovered in this case, it is
known that much German neo-Nazi support-in the form of hate and Holo- caust
denial propaganda and explosives manuals (some of U.S. military issue) --
is forthcoming from U.S. white power groups. The author cites NEBRASKA as
the WORLD HEADQUARTERS of the successor of the original German Socialist
German Workers (aka: NAZI) Party (Could there be any connection between
this fact and the reported encounters with "German speaking" aerial disk
pilots in NEBRASKA, which have been documented by at least two witnesses? -
Wol). Ironically, the German post-Reich ban on such materials in
conjunction with American First Amendment free speech provisions foster
this situation. A more subtle reason for concern over the ascendancy of
such extremist groups is the current highest postwar unemployment rate in
Germany. [The Oregonian. March 10, 1996]
The famous Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal is more cognizant than most of this
genuine ongoing threat, and has praised this courageous first-ever insider
account of the international neo-Nazi network. Known as the " Führerof the
East," Ingo Hasselbach came of age as a rebel against the East German
Communist state (represented by his Communist journalist father who he did
not know as his real father until adolescence). While being watched since
age 14 by the Stasi (GDR secret police) as a "potential disturber of the
socialist peace...," he courted every protest group regardless of politics:
hippies, punks, skinheads. Getting a prison education from a former Gestapo
officer about the alleged Jewish conspiracy against the Fatherland, he
"graduated" to form the German Democratic Republic's first neo-Nazi party
in 1988 and served for five years as the leader of the movement's
recruiting and violent activities.
While not excusing Hasselbach's behavior, his fractured family background
in a totalitarian state surely served as fertile ground for a career as a
sub- versive. Early memories humanize what might have been a mere diatribe
against his former peers: e.g., his grandmother telling him, ironically,of
being taken to a concentration camp for looking Jewish and then being
released (one of many ironies in the book); and being impressed by the
rebelliousness, rather than the ideology, of a school classmate who gave
the Nazi salute to an authoritarian teacher.
Hasselbach now lives in fear of his life from former Kamrades, for his
public dialog devoted to dissuading German youth from his fanatical path.
How then did his re-education and renunciation in 1993 evolve? His
conscience was finally penetrated by the fatal 1992 firebombing of a
Turkish family, though he claims that his group was not responsible for
that incident; the final severing resulted from the attempted bombing of
his mother's Berlin apartment in response to the earliest inkling of his
turncoat leanings. Coinci- dentally in the U.S. for the first time just two
days prior to the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing, he described in
non-excusing words his reaction to such horrific events: "Morally, I was a
bomb-thrower and just as responsible as anyone who planted a fuse or drove
a truck with explosives. ""The first step for me in rejoining the civilized
world was in realizing that." "And the first step in fighting them was to
tell the story of what made me one of them, of how I pulled others in, and
of how a sewer of the Third Reich waste water flows beneath the clean
streets of modern Germany."
Hasselbach provides chilling insight into the psychology of hatred and
alien- ation:"...I had walked as if sealed inside an ideological space
suit, treat- ing my enemies as if they were deadly viruses. The suit kept
the virus from infecting me and killing the hate. To take the suit off and
approach my enemy, without my ideology on, was to risk discovering him as a
person."
Perhaps even more important than insights into the neo-Nazi psyche and
organization, this book confronts us with the dilemma of how to inoculate
against such inhumane ideas and actions in a democratic society.

======================================= by Jacob G. Hornberger Before the
end of World War II, in 1944, Friedrich A. Hayek, who was later to win the
Nobel memorial prize in economic science, startled the Western world with a
book entitled The Road to Serfdom. Hayek argued that despite the war
against Nazi Germany, the eco- nomic philosophy of the Nazis and communists
was becoming the guiding light for American and British policymakers. In
his forward to the 1972 edition of the book, Hayek wrote: But after war
broke out I felt that this widespread misunderstanding of the political
systems of our enemies, and soon also of our new ally, Russia, constituted
a serious danger which had to be met by a more systematic effort. Also, it
was already fairly obvious that England herself was likely to experiment
after the war with the same kind of policies which I was convinced had
contributed so much to destroy liberty elsewhere. . . . Opinion moves fast
in the United States, and even now it is difficult to remember how
comparatively short a time it was before 'The Road to Serfdom' appeared
that the most extreme kind of economic planning had been seriously
advocated and the model of Russia held up for imitation by men who were
soon to play an impor- tant role in public affairs. . . . Be it enough to
mention that in 1934 the newly established National Planning Board devoted
a good deal of attention to the example of planning provided by these four
countries: Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan. As the 50th anniversary of
the end of World War II approaches, Americans must ask themselves a
troubling question: Did Hayek's concerns become reality, have Americans, in
fact, traveled the road to serfdom the past fifty years? Or, put another
way, did the Nazis lose the military battles but win the war for the hearts
and minds of the American people? (or rather, one might suggest, the hearts
and minds of the political and economic leaders? - Wol.)... And if there is
any doubt whether the Nazi economic philosophy did, in fact, win the hearts
and minds of the American people, consider the following description of the
Nazi economic system by Leonard Peikoff in his book The Ominous Parallels:
Contrary to the Marxists, the Nazis did not advocate public owner- ship of
the means of production. They did demand that the government oversee and
run the nation's economy. The issue of legal ownership, they explained, is
secondary; what counts is the issue of control. Private citizens,
therefore, may continue to hold titles to property, so long as the state
reserves to itself the unqualified right to REGULATE the use of their
property... The truth is that Hayek's warning was ignored. Having defeated
the Nazis in battle, Americans became ardent supporters and advocates of
Nazi economic policies. Why? Part of the answer lies in another feature
that was central to the Nazi way of life: public schooling. "Oh, no! You
have gone too far this time," the average American will exclaim. "Public
schooling is a distinctively American institution, as American as apple pie
and free enterprise." The truth? As Sheldon Richman documents so well in
his new book, Separating School & State, 20th-century Americans adopted the
idea of a state-schooling system in the latter part of the 19th century
from, you guessed it, Prussia! (or Germany, as it was previously known. -
Wol.) And as Mr. Richman points out, public schooling has proven as
successful in the United States as it did in Germany. Why? Because it has
succeeded in its goal of producing a nation of "good, little citizens",
people who pay their taxes on time, follow the rules, obey orders, condemn
and turn in the rule-breakers, and see themselves as essential cogs in the
national wheel. Consider the words of Richard Ebeling, in his introduction
to Separating School & State: In the hands of the state, compulsory public
education becomes a tool for political control and manipulation, a prime
instrument for the thought police of the society. And precisely because
every child passes through the same indoctrination process, learning the
same ''official history," the same "civic virtues," the same lessons of
obedience and loyalty to the state, it becomes extremely difficult for the
independent soul to free himself from the straightjacket of the ideology
and values the political authorities wish to imprint upon the population
under its jurisdiction. For the communists, it was the class struggle and
obedience to the Party and Comrade Stalin; for the fascists, it was worship
of the nation-state and obedience to the Duce; for the Nazis, it was race
purity and obedience to the Fuhrer. The content has varied, but the form
has remained the same. Through the institution of compulsory state
education, the child is to be molded like wax into the shape desired by the
state and its educational elite. We should not believe that because ours is
a freer, more democratic society, the same imprinting procedure has not
occurred even here, in America. Every generation of school-age children has
imprinted upon it a 'politically correct' ideology concerning America's
past and the sanctity of the role of the state in society. Practically
every child in the public school system learns that the "robber barons" of
the 19th century exploited the common working man; that unregulated
capitalism needed to be harnessed by enlightened government regulation
beginning in the Progressive era at the turn-of-the-century; that wild Wall
Street speculation was a primary cause of the Great Depression; that only
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal saved America from catastrophe; and that
American intervention in foreign wars has been necessary and inevitable,
with the United States government required to be a global leader and an
occasional world policeman. This brings us to the heart of the problem, the
core of the Nazi mind-set: that the interests of the individual must be
subordinated to the interests of the nation. This is the principle that
controls the minds of the American people, just as it controlled the minds
of the German people sixty years ago. Each person is viewed like a bee in a
hive; his primary role in life is to serve the hive and the ruler of the
hive, and to be sacrificed when the hive and its ruler consider it
necessary. This is why Americans of our time, unlike their ancestors, favor
such things as income taxation, Social Security, socialized medicine, and
drug laws; they believe, as did Germans in the 1930s, that their bodies,
lives, income, and property, in the final analysis, are subordinate to the
interests of the nation. As you read the following words of Adolf Hitler,
ask yourself which American politician, which American bureaucrat, which
American schoolteacher, which American citizen would disagree with the
principles to which Hitler subscribed: "It is thus necessary that the
individual should finally come to realize that his own ego is of no
importance in comparison with the existence of his nation; that the
position of the individual ego is conditioned solely by the interests of
the nation as a whole; that pride and conceitedness, the feeling that the
individual . . . is superior, so far from being merely laughable, involve
great dangers for the existence of the community that is a nation; that
above all the unity of a nation's spirit and will are worth far more than
the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual; and that the higher
interests involved in the life of the whole must here set the limits and
lay down the duties of the interests of the individual. (I think what
Adolph Hitler was actually saying on behalf of himself and the Nazi elite
who ruled World War II Germany was: "You're job is to serve your masters,
and give up your individuality for the sake of the interests and egos of
your leaders, no matter what sacrifice that might require." - Wol.) Even
though the average American [is conditioned to] enthusiastically support
the Nazi economic philosophy, he recoils at having his beliefs labeled as
"Nazi." Why? Because, he argues, the Nazi government, unlike the U.S.
government, killed six million people in concentration camps, and this mass
murder of millions of people, rather than eco- nomic philosophy, captures
the true essence of the Nazi label. What Americans fail (or refuse) to
recognize is that the concentration camps were simply the logical extension
of the Nazi mind-set! It does not matter whether there were six million
killed, or six hundred, or six, or even one. The evil, the terrible, black
evil, is the belief that a govern- ment should have the power to sacrifice
even one individual for the good of the nation. Once this basic
philosophical premise and political power are conceded, innocent people,
beginning with a few and inevitably ending in multitudes, will be killed,
because "the good of the nation" always ends up requiring it. Mr.
Hornberger is founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation.
