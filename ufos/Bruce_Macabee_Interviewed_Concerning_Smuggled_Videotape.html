 R 13 : *SYSTEM*             | Switching to Science & UFO CO
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Hi, JB!
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Hi,  bear with me, just getting the hang of 
                            | this...
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | <<arrives to thunderous applause!!>>
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Welcome to UFO, then!
                            | Hi, COTMD!
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | <<kiss>> Hiya Deb : )
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Mark?
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | Hi JB!
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Saw the notice and thought I'd check it out
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | At your service.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | I'm glad, JB!
                            | Thought so.
                            | <kiss> back!
                            | So - anything happening tonight?
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | You CO?
       JB (not the Scotch)  | With regard to WHAT ??
       Cult Of The Mad Dog  | Your even.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Sorta, Mark.
                            | Just wondered...
                            | if the two of you had any particular topic.
                            | Hi, Admiral!
       Mark                 | Ummmm.....gimme a sec, I had something on a 
                            | bit of paper.
        Admiral Smith       | HI, Debbie
                            | Sorry, a bit slow tonight
       Mark                 | Hi Ryan! :)
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | What's that, Mark?
       Mark                 | It was something I read today......
        Admiral Smith       | Cult of the mad dog, huh?
       Mark                 | about an asteroid........
        Admiral Smith       | Variation of cult of the mad cow?
       Mark                 | that came VERY near to hitting us.......
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | When, Mark?
       Mark                 | but suddenly changed course!!.......
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Very near in galactic terms???
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | No way!
       Mark                 | it was a few months back.
       JB (not the Scotch)  | as in a few million miles
       Mark                 | JB : Yup, like a few miles.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Mark, I'm skeptical.
       Mark                 | Yes, Way <G>........
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Can you give us a date?
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Would an event of that proximity wreak havoc 
                            | on the 
                            | tides, etc...???
       Mark                 | seriously I took the info down on a piece of 
                            | paper rather than 
                            | buy the whole magazine <s>.......
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | It would depend on how big and how close, JB.
                            | HI, Frank!
       Frank Stanley        | Hi Debbie and All
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Yeah and mass too, I'm sure (less mass 
                            | probably 
                            | like a gnat on you at the beach...)
       Mark                 | And now I cant find were I've put it <<sigh>>
       Frank Stanley        | What's the topic?
        Admiral Smith       | If it was the size of the thing in ID4, it 
                            | would kill a 
                            | few tides
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Mark read about an asteroid that almost hit 
                            | the 
                            | earth.
                            | I STILL haven't seen ID4.
                            | <sigh>
       Mark                 | Me neither, not out here till Aug 9th. : (
       JB (not the Scotch)  | You must be tho only one...
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Probably!
       Frank Stanley        | When did this happen?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | That's what we're trying to find out, Frank.
       Mark                 | A few months back Frank.
       JB (not the Scotch)  | I hear ID4 (pt. 2) ins already on the board...
       Frank Stanley        | Where did you learn about this Mark?
       Mark                 | In "Focus" magazine.
                            | This months issue.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Hi, Susanne!
       Frank Stanley        | Im sorry what is Focus?
                            | Hi Sus
       §usanne              | Hi! :)
                            | Debbie, you can call me Sus... its easier<g>.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Hi, Daniel!
        Admiral Smith       | Hi Dan
       Mark                 | Its a UK magazine, kind of like a "Whats New 
                            | In The World 
                            | Of Technology" magazine.
       Daniel Roberts       | Hello to all--is this a formal conference?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | No it isn't, Daniel.
       Daniel Roberts       | TNX
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Mark, is it available over here?
                            | Do you have any ideas?
                            | Oh, and Frank....
                            | I have a question for you.
       Mark                 | Im not sure Deb, would have to check.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | I'll look for it.
       JB (not the Scotch)  | So mark, have you found the article yet...or 
                            | should I 
                            | drop off and surf the net for it...
       Mark                 | JB : I didnt buy the mag, I just noted down a 
                            | few details on a 
                            | piece of paper which I cant find at the 
                            | moment.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Well, keep looking, Mark.
                            | Frank....
                            | are you keeping up with the work of Dr. Roger 
                            | Leir?
                            | Hi, Sarak!
       Frank Stanley        | I know about it but do not regularly keep up 
                            | with it. 
                            | What is going on Debbie?
        Admiral Smith       | Hi Sarak
       Sarak                | Hello
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | That's what I hoped you knew!
       Sarak                | Please don't let me interupt, continue
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | he was waiting for some test results.
        Admiral Smith       | What's Sarak?
       Frank Stanley        | Is he the son of the Lear jet magnet?
       Sarak                | Spokes father
                            | Spocks father
       Frank Stanley        | That's Spock
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | That's what I thought.
       Frank Stanley        | GMTA
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Whew!
       §usanne              | <g>
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | So - no one has heard anything about the 
                            | analysis?
       §usanne              | Nope... sorry.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Well, rats.
       Daniel Roberts       | Analysis of what?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | I was hoping someone had.
        Admiral Smith       | Sorry Sarak, you're wrong
                            | Spock's father was named Sarek
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Daniel, Dr. Leir is the one overseeing the 
                            | removal 
                            | of implants...
        Admiral Smith       | Sorry
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | from several abductees.
        Admiral Smith       | I'm very slow tonight
       Frank Stanley        | Oh that Dr. Leir
       Daniel Roberts       | OIC!
       Frank Stanley        | He is not the guy who carries them around in 
                            | a case is 
                            | he?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Yes.
                            | No, that's Darryl Sims.
       Mark                 | <<smirks>>
       Daniel Roberts       | Deb (may I call you that?) What are the 
                            | implants for??
       Sarak                | Thank you, I just took the name for those of 
                            | you who 
                            | I have spoken to, you know me as Mark M.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Sure, Daniel.
                            | Hi, Tom!
       §usanne              | Hi Tom!!! :)
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Daniel, the people involved just knew they 
                            | were 
                            | there.
       Tom G                | Evening, all!
       Sarek                | Hello Tom
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | And he took two of 'em outta someone's big 
                            | toe..
                            | he's a podiatrist...
                            | and is supervising taking them outta some 
                            | other 
                            | people.
       Daniel Roberts       | Howdy, Tom! Deb: But what do they do? 
                            | Tracking devices or what? Mind control??
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Daniel, they don't know.
                            | Tom - keeping up with the implant removal?
       Tom G                | Damn silly place to put an implant, though. 
                            | Think about it - the big toe is used for all 
                            | kinds of sensory input.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | no kidding!
                            | So why there?
                            | It's not like they wanted them there!
       Mark                 | Last place you would look?
       Tom G                | Debbie - not really.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | The people, I mean, Tom.
                            | They wanted them out.
                            | What's your take on all this, then?
       Daniel Roberts       | Big toe is necessary feedback sensor for 
                            | equilibrium--direct tap to the 
                            | brain/cerebellum?
       Tom G                | I think a certain podiatrist has discovered a 
                            | new way to make some money. :-)
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Tom, I talked to him.
       Daniel Roberts       | People who lose theri big toe through 
                            | accidenty have a lot of difficulty with 
                            | balance, gait, and spatial relations.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | I don't feel that way at all.
       Tom G                | I mean - look. If I needed to put a tracker 
                            | in somebody, I'd pick one of the large and 
                            | not-terribly enervated
                            | muscles - the thigh or the bicep.
        Raven/SL16          | Evenin' ya'll!
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Tom, fair enough.
                            | Hi, Rave!
       Daniel Roberts       | Deb: Wherre else have these implants beeen 
                            | found?
       Tom G                | Raven, Sugah!
        Raven/SL16          | Hey Deb!
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | But I saw the video of the implant removal.
       Daniel Roberts       | Hello Raven!
        Raven/SL16          | Tom Tom Sugah!
       Frank Stanley        | Hi Rave
        Raven/SL16          | Hen Daniel!
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | These things were deep.
        Raven/SL16          | Hiya Frank!
                            | Hey too. <G>
       Sarek                | If you belive as I that Aliens are the 
                            | missing link and 
                            | the orientals are closest in features and 
                            | mind 
                            | capacity in their beliefs, you must refer to 
                            | the 
                            | concept of accupunture. The big toe is 
                            | considered 
                            | the window to the body, so it would make 
                            | sense that 
                            | is where they would implant a monitoring 
                            | device
       §usanne              | Hi Raven! :)
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | And, according to Dr. Leir...
        Raven/SL16          | Hi Sus!
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | there were no external scars where the 
                            | implants 
                            | could have been put in.
                            | Sarek....
                            | I didn't realize that.
                            | Okay, Tom....
       Sarek                | To lift a nail and put it back would not show 
                            | any 
                            | evidence of probing
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | have you read anything about the metallic 
                            | analysis?
       Mark                 | Nope, sorry, can't find that bit of paper,  
                            | when I do I'll post 
                            | in this section.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Thanks, Mark!
       Tom G                | Yeah - that's bogus as well. At least the one 
                            | I read was. It's all biologically active 
                            | material..
       Frank Stanley        | Debbie is there any new leaks out of NASA 
                            | regarding 
                            | astronauts experiences with UFOs

                            | No way!
       Tom G                | *not* what you would make an implant out of. 
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Won't happen.
                            | Is there any possibility that the material is 
                            | a 
                            | superconductor?
                            | The bismuth layering is odd.

                            | revealing.
       Frank Stanley        | What does he say?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Tom, have you read anything about the 
                            | preliminary 
                            | findings of the analysis of the implants?
                            | Yes, Daniel, what?
       Tom G                | Some time ago, Deb. I'll have to dig 'em out

       Tom G                | Are they in a reviewed publication? <eg>

       Sarek                | Involuntarily beamed out but I'm back
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | <g>
       Bruce Maccabee       | they started off with a videot ape smuggled 
                            | from the Air Force to a reporter
                            | for Nightline  (t he producer, actually)
       JB (not the Scotch)  | Not in honor of, but to suck off of (like a 
                            | remora...)
       Bruce Maccabee       |  This was to be their piece de resistance...
                            | but it turned out to be mre of a resistance 
                            | than a piece....
       Daniel Roberts       | My oh My! Another smuggled videotape!
       Bruce Maccabee       | They called me up a week in advance to tell 
                            | me about it
                            | and ask if I would analyze it while being 
                            | videoed...
                            | but, sorry, you can't see it first!
                            | So I had to come up with an answer.... cold.
       John W. Ratcliff     | What's your answer hot?
       Bruce Maccabee       | They had already showed i.t to Bob Nathan 
                            | formerly of JPL
                            | who immediately sad  "why, its a meteor."
       Tom G                | Yep. And if you read the messages that Bruce 
                            | and I have been exchanging, you'll see...
       Bruce Maccabee       | The ABC correspondent, Guillen, expected me 
                            | to either endorrse that or 
                            | ssay it was a UFO.
       Tom G                | the difficulities involved in actually 
                            | *doing* anything with this bit of tape. 
       Bruce Maccabee       | ABC had already ruled out the AF explanation 
                            | - airplane - because you 
                            | could see some stars pass "between" the 
                            | assumed wing l/ights and the 
                            | main body light... 
                            | i.n other words, did not appear to be a solid 
                            | structure connecting the main 
                            | three lights. 
       John W. Ratcliff     | Nah, it was meteor's in formation.
       Bruce Maccabee       | So, the first thing I told >Guillen was "This 
                            | is the worst investigation I have 
                            | ever done." 
       Daniel Roberts       | Meteors "in formation"??????
       Bruce Maccabee       | They told me a field of view T HEY THO>UGHT 
                            | (5 degrees) and we 
                            | determine the time and date from info on the 
                            | unclassified tape. 
                            | Did not know which of several telescope on 
                            | Mrt Haleakala i.n Maui took 
                            | the video
       Daniel Roberts       | Arent meteors random??
       Bruce Maccabee       | Did not know ANYTHING about which direction 
                            | the telescope was 
                            | pointed....
       Sarek                | That's what I thought
       Bruce Maccabee       | So I was shooting in the dark... and 
                            | convinced Michael Guillen that 
                            | A BIG QUESTION MARK was the appropriuate 
                            | answer. 
       Mulderwanabe         | uh oh, what'd I do.  Where am I?
       Sus/Busy             | bye everyone :)
       Bruce Maccabee       | Aparently my approach impressed them enough 
                            | so that Tec Koppel 
                            | admitted that they could not identify this... 
                            | thing or things...shown on the 
                            | video.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Hi, MWB.
       Daniel Roberts       | CYA Sus!
       Bruce Maccabee       | I am still trying to get more info....   Will 
                            | l/et you know what it turns out to 
                            | be.. if we can fi.nd out.
                            | ga
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | No luck on getting a copy of the video, Bruce?
       Daniel Roberts       | BRuce: Why were they asking you all this?
       Mulderwanabe         | I just joined this forum 5 seconds ago and I 
                            | think I ran into a 
                            | private meating of some kind.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | No, not at all, MWB.
                            | It's an open conference.
                            | Just chime in.
       Mulderwanabe         | cool
        Admiral Smith       | chime
       Tom G                | Even a copy of the video isn't going to be 
                            | much help without a *lot* of background data.
       Daniel Roberts       | Chimes of freedom, clashing
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Tom, the video itself could help rule out a 
                            | lot of 
                            | things.
       Mulderwanabe         | what do you do here? 
       JB (not the Scotch)  | How's that Deb ?
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | We're currently talking about the Nightline 
                            | Special 
                            | on UFOs last week, JB.
                            | Science and UFOs, MWB.
       Tom G                | Debbie - nope. Not without a *lot* of 
                            | additional data - like the integration time 
                            | and imaging band of the FPA.
       JB (not the Scotch)  | I know, i've been listening, how could the 
                            | tape 
                            | help rule thing out ?
       Bruce Maccabee       | I have not yet received t he promised copy of 
                            | the video.
       Mulderwanabe         | Well, as long as I'm not butting in.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | JB - like Bruce said...
                            | No, not at all, MWB!
       Sarek                | You won't Bruce
       Bruce Maccabee       | T he i.mages are NOT what I  would expect of 
                            | either a meteor group or a 
                            | satelliate group.  T hey are much bigger 
                            | (longer) the point images.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | he can rule out that it's planes or meteors.
                            | Bruce, have you heard *anything* since the 
                            | airing?
       Mulderwanabe         | Well, I missed the show so I can't really say 
                            | much.
       Bruce Maccabee       | I can't absolutely rule out anything until I 
                            | k`now the angle of elevation...
       Daniel Roberts       | Anyone else recently purchase a copy of the 
                            | *Santilli Video* from the Roswell encounter?
       JB (not the Scotch)  | By just the tape, and no reference data ???
       Bruce Maccabee       | however the least probable is airplane 
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | No, why, Daniel?
                            | JB, you can rule things out.
                            | Not prove anything, though.
        Admiral Smith       | Nah, the least probable is a flying moose
       Tom G                | Bruce - exactly. And I agree with that 
                            | statement. <g>
       Bruce Maccabee       | A flying moose....   By George, I think he's 
                            | got it!!!
       Daniel Roberts       | *Santilli Video* seeems somewhat bogus, after 
                            | viewing it--about 2.5 hrs.
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Must get moose and squirrel.
       Bruce Maccabee       | T he metoer hypothesis is also flawed:   
                            | these three main bright lights 
                            | were all about equal in image brightness and 
                            | size
       Tom G                | Hmmmmm - Have Rocky and Bullwinkle been 
                            | hanging around Tonopoh?
       Bruce Maccabee       | all three traveled at the same rate wit the 
                            | middle one a bit ahead of the 
                            | ones above and below
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | But, Bruce - is that not possible?
       Bruce Maccabee       | You don't get meteors traveling "in echelon" 
                            | through space...
                            | T herefore it woul have to be a large 
                            | meteor/fireball  that broke up
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Is that a definite, or an improbable?
       Bruce Maccabee       |  but different sized chunks travel at 
                            | different rates through the atmosphere
        Debbie H/SL13&21    | Ah.
       Bruce Maccabee       |  so in this case we would have to have a rare 
                            | breaku p of a meteor into 
        Admiral Smith       | Maybe a meteor that hit something and broke 
                            | up, 
                            | and the peices stayed at about the same

                            | you have analyzed so far of UFOs?
       Bruce Maccabee       | three equal parts....  plus a cuple of tiny 
                            | ones on either side of t he central

       Tom G                | *Plus* they'd have to keep station purty

       Sarek                | I believe the only time we'll know the true

                            | another 
                            | agency knows he's about to die from a disease 
                            | and is not afraid of any repercussions and 
                            | then tells all he know's. Un til the they'll

       Bruce Maccabee       | If meteors are different sizes the smaller

                            | expect a sizeable different in position 
                            | rather than having them all at about

       Daniel Roberts       | Bruce: what is your background in

       Tom G                | I'd also expect a different video signature.

       Bruce Maccabee       | T here has also been a suggestion of a group

                            | rose  upward to the UFO for a minute or so
