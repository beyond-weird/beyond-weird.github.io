                  GERMAN SUBMARINES IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC

The newspaper "France Soir" had the following account: "Almost 1-1/2 years
AFTER cessation of hostilities in Europe, the Islandic [Icelandic?] Whaler,
'Juliana' was stopped by a large German U-boat. The Juliana was in the
ANTARCTIC region around Malvinas [now Falkland] Islands when a German
submarine surfaced and raised the German official naval Flag of Mourning --
red with a black edge.

The submarine commander sent out a boarding party, which approached the
Juliana in a rubber dinghy, and having boarded the whaler demanded of Capt.
Hekla part of his fresh food stocks. The request was made in the definite
tone of an order to which resistance would have been unwise. The German
officer spoke a correct English and paid for his provisions in U.S.
dollars, giving the Captain a bonus of $10 for each member of the Juliana
crew. Whilst the food stuffs were being transferred to the submarine, the
submarine commander informed Capt. Hekla of the exact location of a large
school of whales. Later the Juliana found the school of whales where
designated."

The French "Agence France Press" on 25 September 1946, said: "The
continuous rumors about German U-boat activity in the region of Tierra del
Fuego [Feuerland, in German], between the southernmost tip OF LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CONTINENT OF ANTARCTICA are based on true happenings."

There have been stories and books written about Germans counterfeiting U.S.
currency and otherwise obtaining American money printing plates, which may
account for the German use of American money.

The Guinness Book of World Records says that the "greatest unsolved
robbery" was the disappearance of the entire German treasury at the end of
the war.
