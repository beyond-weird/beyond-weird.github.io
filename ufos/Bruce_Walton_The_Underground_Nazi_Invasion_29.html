UFO's
and the Occult Reich by TAL From: Nevada Aerial Research Newsletter P.O.
Box 1701 Rock Springs Drive Las Vegas, Nevada 89128 (The above address is
now obsolete. - Wol) In 1867, Wentworth Little founded the English
Rosicrucian Society. He was in contact with the German Rosicrucians. Little
recruited his followers, up to 144 people, from the ranks of the
higher-ranking "Freemasons". (There are two sides to the masonic coin
according to former British Intelligence agent Dr. John Colman and others.
First we have the traditional "guild" Masonry as is practiced by the pro
Judeo- Christian YORK RITE; Second we have the speculative "occult" Mason-
ry movement which was integrated within the SCOTTISH RITE. The Scottish
Rite came out of the "Rite of Perfection", a creation of Jesuit-
Illuminists working within the Jesuit college of Clermont in Paris, France,
according to the Masonic authority Rebold. The Scottish Rite was in- deed
revolutionary in that it called for the absolute destruction of all
national boundaries, all family structures, and all religions which do not
acknowledge the supreme authority of Rome, which has strong ties with the
highest levels of Masonry via the Jesuit Order. A good example of this
connection would be that of Guisseppi Mazzini, a Jesuit who served as the
"deputy" under the Masonic Universal Grand Master Albert Pike. Pike and
Mazzini had created 22 "Palladium" Masonic lodges to facili- tate global
Bavarian Illuminati [Jesuit-Masonic] revolution, which involved a
deliberate plan to incite three "World Wars" to be followed by the
implementation of a "New World Order". It is interesting that the first two
World Wars were initiated with more than a little help from "secret cult"
infested region of Bavaria-Germany. One of the lodges of the "Palladium",
according to ex-O.T.O. Grand Master Dennis Brunnel, happened to contain
within itself an inner lodge called the "Oblonica", which gave rise to the
Italian Mafiosi in America. The Oblonica-Mafiosi was implemented by
Mazzini, who was himself Italian. We must realize that these two MAJOR
Masonic factions with their own differing agendas -- the YORK and SCOTTISH
Rites -- have been competing for supremacy for over two centuries as to
which of them would dominate world masonry. - Wol.) One of his [Wentworth
Little's] disciples was Bulwer Lytton, who was a learned man celebrated
throughout the world for his novel "The Last Days of Pompeii". He also
wrote "The Coming Race" (Zanoni) which featured a mystical pre-Nazi group
in Germany. This Berlin group called itself the "Luminous Lodge", or "Vril
Society"... The book describes a race of men physically far in advance of
surface humans. They have acuired powers over themselves and over all
material objects. They lived in caves and would emerge to reign over the
surface world. The most prominent member of the Vril Society was Karl
Haushofer, a close confidant of Hitler, Hess and Rosenburg, who all
belonged to the Thule Society (Thule Gesellschaft) that was founded in
Munich in 1918. Thule was a neo-Gnostic racist group, which became a
rallying front for the societal roots of Nazi thought. The chief architect
of the Page 1 Thule group was Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff (Rudolf
Glauer) who had direct contact with the Dervish Orders and knew a great
deal about Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism in all its aspects. He
also had contact with Herman Pohl, leader of the German Order Walvater of
the Holy Grail. Nazi occultism was a mixture of influences and a host of
interrelated secret societies, including the Bavarian Illuminati, the
Knights Templar, the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Vehm, the Golden Dawn, the
Rosy-Cross, the Vril Society, the German Order and its offshoot, the Thule
Society. Thule is known as the capital of Hyperborea, in the polar regions.
Also known as "Ultima Thule", it was the gateway to 'other worlds'... The
Grand Lodge of Vril was seeking to re-unite the ancient Aryan traditions
and to make contact with the original super-human "luminous race" (whom
they believed once lived in the ancient land of "Ultima Thule" or
"Hyperborea". The Germanics were/are a very superstitious/occult based
culture, and their occult traditions play a large part in their warped
ideologies of racial supremacy or inferiority -- whether or not such occult
traditions have any truth to them what- so-ever. - Wol) and to make an
alliance with beings who have secret sanctuaries hidden inside the planet.
The book "UFOs - NAZI SECRET WEAPON?" by Mattern-Friedrich brings out some
interesting information, It seems that Victor Schau- berger (1885-1958)
invented a number of "flying disks" for the Nazis between 1938 and 1945.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Vangard Notes... We have seen a copy of a letter from Schauberger to a
friend which states that he worked at Matthausen concentration camp
directing technically oriented prisoners and other German scientists in the
successful construction of a saucer. In this letter written by Schauberger,
he gives further information from his direct experience with the German
military : Page 2 "The "flying saucer" which was flight-tested on the 19th
February 1945 near Prague and which attained a height of 15,000 metres in 3
minutes and a horizontal speed of 2,200 km/hours, was constructed according
to a Model 1 built at Mauthausen concentration camp in collaboration with
the first-class engineers and stress-analysts ASSIGNED TO ME from the
prisoners there. It was only after the end of the war that I came to hear,
through one of the workers UNDER MY DIRECTION, a Czech, THAT FURTHER
INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT WAS IN PROGRESS: however, there was no answer to my
enquiry. From what I understand, just before the end of the war, the
machine is SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DESTROYED on Keitel's orders. That's the
last I heard of it. In this affair, several armament specialists were also
involved who appeared at the works in Prague, shortly before my return to
Vienna, and asked that I DEMONSTRATE the fundamental basis of it: The
CREATION OF AN ATOMIC LOW-PRESSURE ZONE, which DEVELOPS IN SECONDS when
either AIR or WATER IS CAUSED TO MOVE RADIALLY AND AXIALLY under conditions
of a FALLING TEMPERATURE GRADIENT."
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Schauberger and his son lived in the United States for a short time after
the war, where he was reported to be working on a top secret UFO project in
Texas for the US Government. Reports of Aryan looking saucer pilots are
many. Long haired blond folks that speak German. It is interesting to note
that the so- called "venusian" saucer design of contactees all look like
German saucer designs. The Thule Society is still alive in the minds of
neo-Nazi (Fourth Reich) occulists... Ivan Boyes [a Canadian Ufologist]
claims that "after the war, the allies discovered that over 2,000
scientists from Germany AND Italy had vanished along with almost a MILLION
people to the Land beyond the pole [that is, to Antarctica. - Wol.]. This
is apparently what Admiral Byrd's expedition was all about. To hunt them
down. The domain of the 'Arianni'. The "Flugelrads" (wingwheels) were noted
in the secret log [of Admiral Richard E. Byrd]. These were the model T's of
the German saucer design... Admiral Byrd goes back and tells the Pentagon
and the President what he has seen. They order him to be silent. (This
would suggest that prior to OPERATION HIGHJUMP, the Admiral and his crew
may have sighted German disk activity over the polar regions... - Wol.)

* * * * Arktos The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival by
Joscelyn Godwin -------------------------------------- [BOOK REVIEW] ARKTOS
is the first book ever written on the archetype of the Poles: celestial and
terrestrial, North and South. It is a hair-raising voyage through
cosmology, spiritual philosophy, mystical experience, and the beliefs of
the lunatic fringe which leads to startling revelations about the secrets
of the Poles and the ice-bound lands. Many occult systems speak of a Golden
Age, associated with an ancient race that lived in the Arctic regions. Much
embraced by ethnologists and Theosophists, this "Aryan Race" entered the
mythology of Nazi Germany with dreadful consequences. In a responsible and
scholarly fashion, the author explores the origins of modern neo-Nazi
ideology, its "polar" inspiration, and links with other occult myths
including the survival of Hitler, German bases in Antarctica, UFOs, the
Hollow Earth, and the hidden [subterranean] king- doms of Agartha and
Shambhala [Ref. to Trevor Ravenscroft's book THE SPEAR OF DESTINY - Wol.]
Arktos is an important book which touches on the deepest mysteries of human
and cosmic destiny -- and the eternal problem of good and evil.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reviews and Comments "Arktos explores the tangled web of myths, scientific
notions, and religious beliefs surrounding the poles. Given the fantastic
and occult nature of his subject, Professor Godwin has given us a
masterpiece of clarity and economy." -- Dr. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke,
Author, THE OCCULT ROOTS OF NAZISM. "Protected by his firm-rooted sanity
and scholarship, Joscelyn Godwin enters deep and perilous waters and
returns with astonishing news from the underworld. The creatures he
encounters are not just imaginary phantoms, but border constantly upon
reality and, in times of change, threaten to rise up and overwhelm the
minds of a generation." -- John Mitchell, author of many books including,
THE VIEW OVER ATLANTIS ". . . A fascinating work of occult history which
manages to be as intriguing as The Morning of the Magicians, but which
holds to a much higher standard of scholarship." -- Jay Kinney. Publisher,
Gnosis Maga- zine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
About the Author Born in England, Joscelyn Godwin teaches at Colgate
University in New York state. He is the author of Robert Fludd, The Mystery
of the Seven Vowels, Harmony of the Spheres, and many other books and
translations related to the Western esoteric traditions.

GIVING THE DEVIL HIS DUE: HOLOCAUST REVISIONISM AS A TEST CASE FOR FREE
SPEECH AND THE SKEPTICAL ETHIC

By Frank Miele

...

Ernst Zündel: Playing With Fire

A Canadian resident but German citizen, Ernst Zündel is the most outspoken
and visible advocate of Holocaust revisionism. He is, interestingly
(especially for skeptics) also the author of UFO's: Nazi Secret Weapons?,
which has sold out seven underground printings. The book argued that what
are usually described as flying saucers from outer space are actually Nazi
secret weapons, still being launched from a hole in the ice in
Antarctica...

While some Holocaust revisionists operate quietly and seek outlets in
academic or academic-like journals, Zündel unleashes an avalanche of
newsletters, audio cassettes, stickers, radio and TV broadcasts. The sheer
volume of his output would be the envy of any political campaign manager or
television evangelist. His tone, however, in person, phone conversations,
audio cassettes (which open with a trumpet fanfare that sounds like a 40's
Movietone newsreel) is almost always calm and didactic.

During a recent visit to German-American friends in the San Fran- cisco Bay
Area, Zündel surprised me with a phone call and invited me over for a
lengthy and wide ranging discussion and interview. The word "Zündel," I
found out, comes from the same root as "zü ndeln" -- to play with fire. The
word, he explained, can have the connota- tion of either a spark plug (that
which ignites something for a desired purpose) or someone running
irresponsibly through the haystacks...

Zündel will dangle a reference to UFO's or the wisdom of the ancient
Atlanteans. If it has no effect, he just moves on. If it elicits
skepticism, he blows it off with a jovial "for whatever it's worth." Given
our early conversation on the UFO book, I'm still not sure whether Zündel
really believes any of this esoteric stuff or whether he's just learned how
effective pushing hot buttons is in grabbing the media spotlight and
perhaps bringing in donations.

                    Ernst Zündel's Flying Saucers Index

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ernst Zündel has done extensive research into the theory that UFOs are
really Nazi airships flying reconaissance missions from a secret base at or
near the South Pole.

We are not making this up.

The following web pages detail this research. Samisdat is the name of
Zündel's publishing company.

...

     Transcription of a pamphlet from Zündel concerning an expedition to
     find secret UFO bases.

What's New at Samisdat?

     Three transcriptions and large images of pages of a pamphlet. Page one
     features many photographs of 'German UFO prototypes.' Page two has an
     interesting picture of a 'German scientist at work,' looking at a
     penguin. Page three has order forms.

UFO Investigator Pass

     An official UFO Investigator Pass, complete with UFO spotting chart
     and questions to ask the UFO occupants when they land.

Spotting Chart

     Detail of another UFO spotting chart, with directions about what sorts
     of notes to take upon sighting a UFO.

This page has seen many visitors since late January, especially since pages
like Rich Graves' Zündelsite mirror (now defunct) added a link here. So
perhaps a bit more background about the flying saucers would be in order.

Zündel's real beliefs about UFOs are not clear. Frank Miele summarized it
well in his article " Giving the Devil His Due," concerning Zündel's book
UFOs: Nazi Secret Weapons?:

     The book argued that what are usually described as flying saucers
     from outer space are actually Nazi secret weapons, still being
     launched from a hole in the ice in Antarctica... "With a picture
     of the Führer on the cover and flying saucers coming out of
     Antarctica it was a chance to get on radio and TV talk shows. For
     about 15 minutes of an hour program I'd talk about that esoteric
     stuff. Then I would start talking about all those Jewish
     scientists in concentration camps, working on these secret
     weapons. And that was my chance to talk about what I wanted to
     talk about."

     "In that case," I asked him, "do you still stand by what you
     wrote in the UFO book?" "Look," he replied, "it has a question
     mark at the end of the title."

     [...]

     It should be pointed out that one of Zündel's most popular books,
     "Did Six Million Really Die?," also has the terminal question
     mark.

     Michael Hoffmandescribed the flying saucer material in his book
     on Zündel thusly:

          Zundel the advertising man and media manager went into
          high gear, developing his controversial "Flying Saucer"
          line of publications. Less imaginative potential allies
          did not understand the tactic. They felt he should
          simply try and try and try again to pursue more
          traditional paths to public recognition. Some of them
          are still trying.

          Hitler's Secret Antarctic Bases, Nazi Super-Weapons and
          the mystic secrets of the Aryan Hindu prophetress
          Savitri Devi were themes the public -- and even their
          commissars -- simply could not ignore. The 1970's
          witnessed a tidal wave of renewed interest in all
          things spiritual and Zundel was riding the wave for all
          it was worth. In countless radio talk shows, he held
          forth on spaceships, spacecraft, "free energies,"
          electromagnetism, emergent technologies and the
          occasionally positive contributions those otherwise
          condemned Germans produced under the Third Reich in
          these fields.

          Periodicals accepted ads for flying saucer books that
          would have obstinately refused similar space for The
          Auschwitz Lie. "When one door is closed, another will
          open." By this means, Zundel established a mail order
          business combining several book titles from revisionist
          andFortean fields appealing to a broad base of free
          thinkers and truth seekers.

          The Great Holocaust Trial, Hoffman, Michael A.,
          Institute for Historical Review, Torrance, California,
          1985, p. 18.

     ...Zündel is wrong regardless of his opinions about flying
     saucers. Nizkor has much documentation of the errors of Zündel
     and other Holocaust-deniers; a good place to start is the QAR.
