to his 1890s buyout of the giant Union Pacific Railroad.

Max Warburg had long worked with Lord Milner and others of the
racialist British Round Table concerning joint projects in Africa and
Eastern Europe. He was an advisor to Hjalmar Schacht for several
decades and was a top executive of Hitler's Reichsbank. The reader
may consult David Farrer, "The Warburgs: The Story of A Family"
(New York: Stein and Day, 1975).
