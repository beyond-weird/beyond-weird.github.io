right those which most often succeed."

THE OCTOPUS, BLACK PROJECTS AND THE DULCE FACILITY





The following article comes from the 'TC TECHNICAL CONSULTANT', Nov.-Dec.,
1991 issue:



"The death of a journalist in West Virginia, plus the jailing of an alleged
CIA computer consultant in Washington State may be elements of a much wider
scandal that could have serious implications...

"What started out as an investigation of an apparent case of pirated
software has grown to be a project involving hundreds of journalists all
over the world.

"The dead journalist, Joseph Daniel 'Danny' Casolaro was found dead August
10th in a motel room in West Virginia. His wrists were slashed seven times
on each wrist and a suicide note was found nearby. The only manuscript of
his book, with accompanying notes, WAS MISSING.

"The book, provisionally titled 'The Octopus', was meant to be an explosive
expose of misdeeds by the Justice Department under the Reagan
administration. Time Magazine also reported that Casolaro's research
centered on gambling and attempted arms deals at the Cabazon reservation
near Indio [California].

"Indeed, the scope of Casolaro's investigation was so large that any one of
a large number of areas of research could have been the trigger for a
possible hit.

"While authorities declared his death a suicide, his relatives definitely
stated that Casolaro's mental state was sound, indeed upbeat, after the
completion of his book.

"Casolaro started his work nearly two years before, investigating the
bankrupting of a small computer software company called Inslaw, allegedly
by the U.S. Justice Department. INSLAW, a company headed by Bill and Nancy
Hamilton of Washington D.C., (no connection to researcher Bill Hamilton,
whose writings on the Dulce enigma appear later in this volume. - Branton)
had developed a package known as PROMIS -- short for Prosecutor's
Management Information System -- to act as a case management tool for the
Justice Department's unwieldy work load.

"Inslaw President Bill Hamilton has claimed that Ed Meese associate EARL
BRIAN was given control of pirated versions of the PROMIS software by Meese
to sell back to different U.S. government agencies for great profit. Two
courts have so far agreed with Hamilton, awarding an 8 million dollar
judgment, but a higher ('Justice Dept.'? - Branton) court of appeal has
quashed the award and the verdict, declaring that it was not the
jurisdiction of the lower courts. As of October 9, the case has moved into
the realm of the Supreme Court.

"EARL BRIAN OWNS UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL [UPI] and FINANCIAL NEWS
NETWORK [FNN].

"According to a Washington man, who claims to have modified the cobol-based
software for the CIA and other intelligence agencies, the software was a
reward for Earl Brian's role in arranging the so-called 'October Surprise'
gambit, the alleged conspiracy to withhold the American hostages in Iran
until after the 1980 election which saw Carter removed from power. The
'October Surprise' scandal has taken some time to emerge.

"In a Paris meeting, President Bush is alleged to have met with Ali Akabar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mohammed Ali
Rajai, the future President of Iran and Manucher Ghorbanifar, an Iranian
arms dealer with connections to Mossad, according to Navy Captain Gunther
Russbacher who claims to have flown Bush, William Casey -- the CIA chief --
and Donald Gregg, a CIA operative to that location. Russbacher, who made
these allegations in May is now in jail on Terminal Island, convicted on
the charge of impersonating a U.S. Attorney. (Note: Russbacher 'defected'
from the CIA with 12 Navy Seals under his command, and was on at least two
occasions the target of attempted CIA hits. The would-be assassins
attempted to drive Gunther and his wife off of roads and down the
side-cliffs to their deaths, however according to Russbacher his SEAL-team
agents who were watching over him unbeknownst to the intended assassins,
moved up quickly from behind and sent the CIA "hit men" to THEIR deaths
instead. - Branton)

"The Washington man is MICHAEL RICONOSCIUTO who is now waiting for a trial
in a Washington jail on conspiracy to sell drugs charges, charges which
Riconosciuto claims are manufactured. Indeed, the charge made against
Riconosciuto were made one week after Riconosciuto authored and signed an
affidavit describing his role in modifying the pirated software.

(Note: It is interesting what connections we can find here. Michael
Riconosciuto was a Wackenhut-CIA employee who told researcher Michael
Lindemann that he had attempted to get a whole helicopter full of documents
and evidence detailing illegal biogenetic activities and
non-Congressionally sanctioned projects involving 'illegal aliens' out of
the Nevada Test Site. The chopper was blown out of the sky, killing all
five personnel on board. Michael's father happened to be Marshall
Riconosciuto, a fascist and a supporter of Adolph Hitler who was a very
close friend of Fred L. Crisman. Crisman was involved in the Maurey Island
'UFO' sighting incident in 1947 near Tacoma, Washington, which researcher
Anthony Kimory believes involved the test-flight of hybrid CIA - PROJECT
PAPERCLIP - NAZI aerial disks. There are several sources which claim that
by the early 1940's the Nazi's had succeeded in test-flying wingless
lenticular craft powered by rotary devices, rocket power, and DONUT
CONFIGURATION jet turbine engines -- rather than cylindrical -- with the
cabin stabilized by gyro, the compressors rotating in one direction and the
expansion chambers and vectored exhausts rotating in the opposite
direction. In fact the movie "THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE" correctly implies
that this, one of the largest military battles during World War II between
American and German forces, was an attempt by the Germans to buy time and
prolong the war just a little while longer, for within a few more months
the Germans would have been mass-producing jet fighters, bombers and other
super-weapons that would have been invincible to the turbo-prop fleets of
the Allies. With the Allied invasion of Germany just before mass-production
began, many of the prototypes and plans of the Nazi military machine were
captured. However most of the most sophisticated prototypes, plans and even
scientists mysteriously turned up missing following the war. We will
reserve further discussion on this subject until later in this volume.
After the war had ended several of the Nazi scientists who WERE captured --
and who had helped to develop the revolutionary aircraft -- were recruited
by the CIA as a result of a secret deal that had been made between Allen
Dulles, a member of the Bavarian Illuminati; and Nazi S.S. General Reinhard
Gehlen, a member of the Bavarian Thule Society. The deep connections
between the Bavarian Illuminati which sponsored the CIA and the Bavarian
Thule society which sponsored the Nazi's allowed for the upper covert-ops
levels of the CIA to be manned by nothing less than the core of the Nazi
S.S. itself, with the help of fascist sympathizers and fifth column
double-agents working within American intelligence, although some leading
Nazi's were 'sacrificed' to the Nuremberg trials to appease the Allies and
establish the illusion that Europe had been de-Nazified. Fred L. Crisman
incidentally was a 'witness' to the Maurey Island event and had helped two
Army G-2 agents acquire 'slag samples' which fell from one of the six
DONUT-SHAPED ships observed. On their way to deliver the samples to
Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, their plane crashed and both G-2 agents were
killed. Some people at the time insisted that the plane had been sabotaged.
Two of the reporters who investigated the incident lost their lives, and
Kenneth Arnold who investigated the incident after being commissioned by
AMAZING STORIES editor Ray Palmer, claimed that his conversations with a
high Air Force official concerning the subject were electronically
monitored. Also, strange government agents in dark suits were seen in the
area. Shortly after his investigation Kenneth Arnold, during an air-search
for a crashed plane over Mt. Rainier, saw 9 crescent-shaped discs which he
called 'flying saucers'. The news media publicized the incident and the
term stuck and became a media catch word ever since. Also around this same
time -- 1947 -- Arnold escaped a near-fatal crash when his airplane
mysteriously lost power. The connections do not end here. Fred L. Crisman
was a close friend to Clay Shaw, whom Louisiana District Attorney James
Garrison -- see the movie 'JFK' -- accused of being the CIA-Mafia
go-between in the John F. Kennedy murder. Garrison arrested Shaw in an
effort to charge him and the CIA with the JFK assassination, however only a
few days before the hearing Garrison's star witness David Ferry was killed,
and Garrison's remaining evidence was not enough to bring about a
conviction. Fred Crisman was the first man Clay Shaw called when he heard
that Garrison intended to implicate him. Garrison also believed that Clay
Shaw himself was involved with PROJECT PAPERCLIP, the secret operation to
bring Nazi war criminals into the United States by the hundreds -- some say
thousands -- and give them immunity and new identities in such institutions
as U.S. Intelligence, the Military-Industrial complex, the Space agencies,
and the various Rockefeller-connected oil cartels such as ARCO, STANDARD
[EXXON], ZAPATA, etc., corporations that were supported by the
Bavarian-based secret-society lodges, corporations that had actually sold
oil to the Nazi's during World War II and helped keep the Nazi "war
machine" operating. According to Garrison, Crisman worked as a middle-man
between the fascist policy makers and the lower echelons of the
Military-Industrial Complex. "Oh what a tangled web..." These American
mega-bankers and traitors to freedom had supported the Nazi's in an effort
to initiate a Bavarian-backed "New World Order", under the cover of the
"Third Reich". Read the book NONE DARE CALL IT CONSPIRACY, by the late Gary
Allen for more on the Rockefeller connection, and also the various works by
Dr. Antony Sutton. - Branton)

"The affidavit also claimed that he [Michael Riconosciuto], had been
contacted by phone and threatened by PETER VIDENIEKS -- a Justice
Department employee and Customs official who Riconosciuto alleged had
intelligence ties -- as to the possible consequences of his going public
with certain information.

"According to Riconosciuto, Videnieks was a frequent visitor to the Cabazon
Indian reservation near Palm Springs and visited with tribal manager, John
P. Nichols. Nichols was in essence Riconosciuto's boss in a number of
enterprises conducted on reservation land and the PROMIS modification was
just one of these projects. According to Riconosciuto, in an interview with
T.C. conducted from jail, the PROMIS software was modified to install a
backdoor access for use by American intelligence services. The software was
then sold to 88 different countries as a sort of 'Trojan horse' package
enabling us to access their intelligence systems. According to Riconosciuto
these countries included Iraq and Libya.

"Correspondence between Nichols and other companies, if authentic,
indicates that Riconosciuto's claims of his expertise in the area of
electronics and armaments appear to be true. Marshall Riconoscuito,
Michael's father, is a reputed former business partner of Richard Nixon.

"According to Riconosciuto, the fuzzy status of reservation land as
'sovereign' allowed elements of the CIA and organized crime to conduct
business uniquely.

"Among the projects worked on during this time were joint projects with
WACKENHUT, a company loaded with former CIA and NSA personnel and business
ventures with the Saudi Arabian royal family and other unusual projects.

"A joint venture with Southern California Edison will soon be generating
power for bio-mass drawn from local waste outlets. Biological warfare
projects were investigated with Stormont laboratories looking into the
creation of 'pathogenic viruses' and enhanced fuel-air explosive weapons
were created and tested in league with Meridian Arms at the NEVADA TESTING
RANGE which matched the explosive power of nuclear devices.

"These enhanced weapons gained their power from polarizing the molecules in
the gas cloud by modification of the electric field, a technology developed
from exploring Thomas Townsend Brown's suppressed work, a knowledge which
Riconosciuto claims he gained from working at LEAR in Reno, Nevada.

"Riconosciuto is said to have worked on the enhanced fuel-air explosive
weapons with Gerald Bull of Space Research Corporation. Bull, now deceased,
later became an arms advisor to Saddam Hussein. It is said that HUSSEIN
POSSESSES THE FAE TECHNOLOGY.

"In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times of London was shot
and killed in Guatemala. He had reportedly been trying to interview an
American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time director of security for the
Cabazon Indian Reservation secret projects.

"In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was found dead,
killed by a single bullet in his chest. According to a former federal
official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was found dead in the parking
lot where he had been due to meet with a woman who had crucial evidence to
share substantiating Riconosciuto's claims.

"Both Eisman's and Ng's deaths were declared suicides by authorities.

"Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader who was in vocal opposition to the
developments on the reservation, was found shot to death WITH two friends
in 1981. Their murder remains unsolved.

"The leader of the House, Thomas Foley, announced last month that a formal
inquiry will be initiated into the Inslaw case. Foley appointed Senator
Terry Sanford as co-chairman of the joint congressional panel. Prior to his
election, Senator Sanford was the attorney REPRESENTING Earl Brian in his
1985 takeover bid for United Press International and was instrumental in
appointing Earl Brian, a medical doctor, to the board of Duke Medical
School, of which Sanford is President.

"However, despite repeated requests from journalists to produce photographs
showing Riconosciuto together with Brian, and requests to produce his
passport showing his alleged trip to Iran, he has not yet done so. Also
Riconosciuto failed to be able to describe Peter Videnieks to CNN's
Moneyline program, claiming a medical condition prevented him from
remembering clearly.

"This led one former intelligence operative to speculate that we may be
witnessing a very sophisticated intelligence operation being played out in
public.

"Former F.B.I. Special Agent, Ted Gunderson, speaks FOR Riconosciuto's
credibility. Gunderson, who lives in Manhattan Beach, has worked with
Riconosciuto for many years in his capacity as private investigator.

"Together, according to Gunderson, they were responsible for thwarting a
terrorist operation during the Los Angeles Olympics. According to
Gunderson, Riconosciuto was well known in certain circles as a genius in
almost all sciences.

"The so-called drug operation broken up in Washington State was an
electrohydrodynamic mining operation claimed Gunderson, using Townsend
Brown technology. A videotape viewed by this journalist revealed metallic
powders and apparent processes unrelated to drug manufacture. Indeed, a
government analysis of soil samples revealed the absence of drug
contamination, but a high concentration of barium. Barium is often found in
high voltage related work.

"Unsubstantiated information from an intelligence source claims that the
current situation is THE VISIBLE EFFECT OF A WAR CURRENTLY GOING ON IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY between a group centered in the CIA called AQUARIUS
[around a powerful center known as MJ-12] and a group known as COM-12
centered around Naval Intelligence. COM-12 is reputedly trying to sustain a
rearguard action to sustain and preserve constitutional government and is
deliberately LEAKING INFORMATION damaging to the former group."



In the same publication, same issue, there appeared a follow-up article
just following the one given above. Written by Thomas Zed, the article,
titled "WACKENHUT'S CONNECTION WITH THE BLACK PROJECT WORLD" stated:

"The Wackenhut company has a very close connection to the world of BLACK
BUDGET PROJECTS. Besides being connected with the Cabazon venture mentioned
in this issue it is also responsible, according to jailed computer
consultant Michael Riconosciuto, FOR THE SECRET PROJECTS BEING UNDERTAKEN
IN DULCE, NEW MEXICO where the JICARILLA INDIAN RESERVATION IS BEING
SIMILARLY USED.

"After sending two of my colleagues there recently AND RECEIVING
CONFIRMATION THAT THERE WAS A TOP SECRET MILITARY TYPE INSTALLATION, I
decided to call the newspaper office and make an educated bluff.

"I identified myself as a freelance reporter from Los Angeles -- and told
the newspaper that I was doing a story on the Cabazon reservation
biological warfare projects that had been undertaken there on behalf of the
CIA. I told her that I had heard that there were similar things being done
in Dulce and would like to know what was going on.

"The official I spoke to BECAME FRIGHTENED and said, 'I can't talk to you
about that! It would be very unprofessional of me to talk to you about
that. You'll have to speak to the President of the tribe.' She then hung
up.

"I have yet to call back and ask the President of the tribe, but will
report on that in the next issue.

"Wackenhut is also responsible for security of a lot of UNDERGROUND
FACILITIES in California and Nevada, including the notorious S-4 or AREA 51
in Nevada where Townsend Brown flying disk technology [written about in a
T.C. recent issue] has been flying and developing for decades.

"A recent helicopter crash at the area, where two pilots and three security
guards from Wackenhut flying in a Messerschmit BO-105 helicopter were
killed was not at all accidental claimed Riconosciuto, who said that the
individuals aboard the helicopter were traveling with sensitive documents.

"Groups are now investigating Riconosciuto's claims..."
