                  THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

The following information comes from a research source which has
investigated actual UNITED NATIONS preparations, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES,
to deal with any resistance to a 'New World Order' takeover. Take note that
FEMA is a major New World Order front with SEVERAL extensive operational
underground bases which, like underground Trojan horses, exist beneath
strategic locations throughout the United States:

"UNITED NATIONS BATTLE GROUPS ENTRANCE TO UNITED STATES PASSED UNDER
PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS SIGNED 11 NOVEMBER 1990

(Note: There are those who are convinced that WITH the Assassination of
President John F. Kennedy a 'coup d'etat' took place within the Executive
branch of the America government via Internationalist groups who are
determined to destroy the U.S. Constitution, and that the 'presidents' who
were manipulated into office since that time -- mostly C.F.R. and T.L.C.
members -- have signed numerous un-constitutional 'executive orders'
designed to pave the way for America's assimilation into a global
dictatorship. If this is the case, then American's have the CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT to resist this FOREIGN U.N. - N.W.O. government, a right which is
also laid down in the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. As for the Kennedy
assassination itself and those behind it, Louisiana District Attorney James
Garrison in an interview with Playboy magazine made the following statement
in regards to Lee Harvey Oswald: "...Our office has positively identified a
number of his associates as neo-Nazis. Oswald would have been more at home
with Mein Kampf than Das Kapital." Ironically, the Mafia agent who was
assigned to kill the 'patsy' Oswald, Jack Ruby, was one of these
"neo-Nazis" according to Garrison. - Branton)

processing point for detainees and can handle up to 100,000 people at a
time.
"D) The Eastern processing center is not yet identified at this time.

"DETENTION FACILITIES -- 23 FEMA Authorized and stationed; 20 DOD
[Department of Defense] Budget authorized and stationed -- 43 TOTAL.

Note: In Red China an untold number of people are suffering in Communist
'Laogai' camps as slave laborers; in Soviet Russia it was the 'Gulag'
camps. In Nazi Germany the 'Concentration' camps were not only used as
slave camps, but also as extermination camps to carry out the genocidel
plans of American CORPORATE and European MILITANT 'Nazis'. I have only one
thing to say concerning these plans for confinement camps here in America,
and I'm sure that many of our Jewish-American citizens who share this
country with us -- that is with ALL of us of all national backgrounds whose
ancestors came from all parts of the world in order to be free from tyranny
-- will agree with me whole-heartedly when I repeat their battle-cry:
"NEVER AGAIN!!!"
