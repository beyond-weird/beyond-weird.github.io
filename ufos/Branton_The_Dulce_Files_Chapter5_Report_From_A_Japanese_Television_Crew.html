REPORT FROM A JAPANESE TELEVISION CREW





Norio Hayakawa is the head of the 'CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK' [P.O. Box
599., Gardena, CA 80248]. Mr. Hayakawa was one of several individuals,
including a Japanese film crew from the NIPPON Television Network in Japan,
who witnessed and video-taped "a flight maneuver of a brightly lit
orange-yellowish light making extremely unorthodox flight patterns,
including sudden acceleration, descension and ascension -- possibly
exerting a force of multiple g's under extremely limited space and time --
and even zig-zag type movements, while on a field trip to an area just
outside of 'Area 51' in Nevada on Wednesday, February 21, 1990" [there were
approximately 25 to 28 individuals in the group who also witnessed the
display]. His brother-in-law Itsuro Isokawa also photographed the object as
it was in flight.

With over 30 years of in-depth UFO investigative experience, Norio was
instrumental in the subsequent production of a two-hour documentary program
televised throughout Japan on March 24, 1990. The entire program dealt with
Area 51 and also the crew's pursuit of an alleged biogenetics laboratory in
New Mexico, that is, the DULCE facility. It is his contention that what
could only be described as "...highly intelligent and deceptive
'ultradimensional entities' materializing in disguise as 'aliens', are
collaborating with a secret 'world government' that is preparing (barring
unexpected circumstances - Branton) to ingeniously 'stage' a
contact-landing...to bring about a 'New World Order'."

(Note: This Alien-Bavarian collaboration is apparently feigning animosity
with one another by pushing for global government so that the world can
join together to "fight the aliens". As in Vietnam and Korea where the
Socialist leaders of the United Nations Organization were playing both
sides of the chessboard, any war waged by the "New World Order" against the
Grays will no doubt be a no-win conflict that will only serve to reduce the
population of the planet, which is after all part and parcel of the overall
Draconian-Bavarian global agenda. Another possibility that has been
suggested is that the Grays will be made out to be the good guys who need
'our' help to break free from the tall Reptiloids and their empire, which
had conquered them in the past, or visa versa. Actually the collaboration
between the Reptiloids and Grays has been undertaken with the full consent
of both sides, and behind the scenes the collectivist Reptiloids, the
Insectoids, the Grays and the Bavarian secret society lodges are all
working together. Many scenarios are possible... however the important
thing to remember is that ANY war waged against the Reptilian Grays which
threatens the American Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution
and the Bill of Rights is merely playing into the hands of the aliens
either way you look at it. International 'cooperation' in a common defense
against an alien threat should be considered SO LONG AS the national
sovereignty of individual nations are not violated in the process. All
nations should learn to be self-supporting and not be tempted to succumb to
a global economic system -- and therefore a global political system, in
that money and politics are more or less synonymous... at least in this
world where those who control the money CONTROL the governments. Also
independent economies will prevent all nations from falling like dominoes
if an economic collapse does occur. The target of any future attacks
against an outside 'threat' to a nation's security should not be excluded
ONLY to the aliens NOR exclusively against human conspirators or tyrants,
but the target of any future conflict with one or the other -- in regards
to planetary or national defense -- should be directed specifically at
those 'areas' where collaboration and interaction between the alien
infiltrators AND the human collaborators are taking place... for instance
areas such as the underground 'joint-interaction' bases of Neu
Schwabenland, Antarctica; Pine Gap, Australia; Alsace-Lorraine Mts. area of
France-Germany; and of course and probably by far the worst of all, the
underground mega-complex below DULCE, NEW MEXICO where the worst life-forms
this universe has to offer seemingly congregate, conceive and carry out
their atrocities against their victims -- or those who have been taken or
abducted to the base permanantly -- as well as against their
implanted-programmed victims beyond the confines of the base who are
never-the-less forced to exist in 'psychological' concentration camps
imposed on them against their will by the 'collaboration'. - Branton)

Furthermore, Norio Hayakawa contends that the 'GRAND DECEPTION "...will
immediately follow a rapid series of shocking, incredible events in
succession, beginning with a Russia-backed Arab Confederacy's attempt to
invade Israel, simultaneous worldwide earthquakes, worldwide stock market
crash and a sudden, mysterious 'evacuation' of a segment of the planets
population, all of which will culminate in a quick official formation of a
New World Order [based in Europe] that will last for seven years upon its
inception."

(Note: It is interesting that George Washington's famous 'vision' at Valley
Forge accurately predicted the Revolutionary and Civil wars and their
outcome, and also a 'third trial' through which America must pass... an
air, ground and sea invasion of the America's by a World Order which will
have conquered all of Asia, Africa and Europe. Depending on how one
interprets the prophecies of Revelation, this siege will last for either 3
1/2 or 7 years, and will end with an American victory aided by Divine
Intervention. I personally believe that America is the 'wilderness' spoken
of in the 12th chapter of the book of Revelation. Since the world empire
will last no longer than 7 years according to the books of DANIEL and
REVELATION, the invasion/siege of America must also not exceed 7 years,
although I suspect that it will be closer to 3 1/2 years. Also Washington's
vision combined with other prophetic sources seem to imply that those who
are living west of the Mississippi river at this time will be far better
off then those in the 'occupied' zone east of the Mississippi. If General
Washington's vision was accurate, then the ultimate outcome of the battle
is not the question. The real question is HOW MANY Americans --
North-Central-South Americans -- will survive through to the final victory?
- Branton)

Norio also explains that the 'Grand Deception' and the shocking series of
events will "...put millions and millions of people worldwide in an
absolute stupor for months during which time a special, extremely
effective, multi-leveled 'mind control' program will be activated to calm
down the stunned populace..."

Hayakawa has himself appeared on Japanese television, has lectured
considerably, has appeared on a radio station in Phoenix, Arizona, and has
been the subject of an article in the ARIZONA REPUBLIC, has published
articles in 'U.S. Japanese Business News' [March, 1990], was the guest on a
Japanese talk show in March and April of 1990, and also appeared on the
Billy Goodman 'Happening' on KVEG of Las Vegas several times in early 1990,
and in 1995 made dramatic appearances on Art Bell's DREAMLAND broadcast. He
was also interviewed on the Anthony J. Hilder Show on "Radio Free America"
aired in Anchorage, Alaska, during all of which he spoke extensively about
his interesting beliefs concerning the origin and nature of UFO's.



In a letter dated January 28, 1991, Norio added the following comments
concerning the 'Dulce' facility and it's possible connection with the
'Mystery of Iniquity' of Bible prophecy:



"...I've been to Dulce with the Nippon Television Network crew and
interviewed many, many people over there and came back with the firm
conviction that something was happening around 10 to 15 years ago over
there, including nightly sightings of strange lights and appearances of
military jeeps and trucks. And I am convinced that the four corners area is
a highly occult area. The only stretch of highway, namely Highway 666, runs
through the four corners area from southeast Arizona to North-western New
Mexico and up [and into SW Colorado and SE Utah]. I have also heard that
this Highway 666 came into existence around 1947 or 1948, fairly close to
the time of 1947, the modern-day beginning of OVERT UFO APPEARANCE, i.e.
the Kenneth Arnold incident, and coincidentally or not, the establishment
of Israel in 1948."

(Norio believes that the establishment of the nation of Israel in 1948
began the 'countdown' to the final apocalypse -- see Revelation chapter 12,
for instance. - Branton)



The following is a transcript of parts of a speech presented by Mr.
Hayakawa at the 11th 'LOS ANGELES WHOLE LIFE EXPO' held at The Los Angeles
Airport Hilton Convention Center on November 16 and 17, 1991. The
transcript from which we will quote is a revised and expanded version of
the address or lecture written on June of 1992 and titled: 'UFO'S, THE
GRAND DECEPTION AND THE COMING NEW WORLD ORDER':



"...AREA 51 is located in the northeastern corner of a vast, desolate
stretch of land known as the Nevada Test Site [a large portion of which
includes the Nellis Air Force Test Range] but has practically nothing to do
with underground nuclear testing. It is located approximately 125 miles
north-northwest of Las Vegas and consists of Groom Lake and the Papoose
Lake Complexes. The presently expanding eastern portion of the latter
complexes is known as the S-4 site.

"This entire area is under the strictest control of Airspace R-4808N [with
unlimited 'ceiling'], prohibiting any entry therein of air traffic,
civilian or military, unless special clearance for such entry is secured
well in advance. By land, the area is meticulously patrolled 24-hours a day
by several tiers of external security even though it is conveniently
'covered' by the... Jumbled Hills [...which cover north of the Papoose Lake
area], making it virtually impossible for anyone to see the facilities
without first climbing atop the hills of the rugged mountain range which
became off-limits to the public since 1985.

"The main external perimeter security is now being handled by Wackenhut
Special Securities Division, part of the operations of Wackenhut
Corporation, a worldwide semi-private security firm based in Coral Gables,
Florida which has an exclusive contract with the U.S. Department of Energy
and handles not only the perimeter security at the Nevada Test Site but
also at many other secret facilities and sensitive installations
through-out the U.S. and U.S. interests worldwide, including ground-level
perimeters for several large underground facilities in and around Edwards
Air Force Base in Southern California.

"It is also important to mention that dozens of unmanned, miniature-sized
remote-controlled automatic security vehicles constantly patrol the
immediate perimeters of the S-4 Site, located around [and presently
expanding particularly towards the eastern portion of] Papoose Lake. These
automatic, miniature sized four-wheel vehicles have been produced by Sandia
Laboratories of Albuquerque, New Mexico exclusively for the Department of
Energy.

"The outer northeastern perimeters of this area located in the Tickaboo
Valley come under the geographical jurisdiction of Lincoln County and are
relegated to the Bureau of Land Management [B.L.M.]. Yet it is considered
highly inadvisable for anyone to even enter the main country dirt road,
known as the Groom Road, which begins its southwestern extension towards
Groom Lake from a point midway between mile marker 34 and 33 on Highway
375, and leads to the guard shack located two and a half miles northeast of
the Groom Lake complexes.

"The first line of exterior security forces [dressed in military-type
camouflage uniforms but with no insignia of any kind whatsoever] consists
of the GP patrols [the 'Groom Proper' patrols, in Bronco-type four-wheel
drive vehicles] who sometimes drive around at night with their lights off
on various country dirt roads adjacent to the outer demilitarized zone,
intimidating any civilian vehicle that tries to enter those access roads
[off of Highway 375] located on public land. The GP patrols themselves
[part of Wackenhut Special Securities Division], however, are strictly
ordered to avoid any direct contact with civilians. They are only
instructed to radio the Lincoln County Sheriff immediately should anyone be
spotted driving on any of those dirt roads. The most common radio frequency
used between Security Control and Lincoln County Sheriff's patrols is
138.306 MHZ.

"...The only area 'allowed' by the Sheriff for such curiosity seekers to
'congregate' is an open area near a black mailbox located at the south side
of Highway 375 between mile marker 29 and 30. Even then, the Sheriff patrol
will routinely stop by during the evening to check on the cars parked at
the mailbox area.

"Moreover, it is our understanding, based on information provided by a
highly reliable source connected to a special U.S. Navy SEAL operations
center, that the mailbox area is constantly being monitored by
high-powered, state-of-the-art, infra-red telescopes set up at a facility
known as Security Control high atop Bald Mountain [10 miles west of the
area], the highest peak in the Groom Mountain Range.

"...It was precisely at 4:45 a.m. on the morning of Thursday, April 16,
1992, that an NBC news crew, dispatched to the area to report on the
landing of an alleged super spy-plane known as Aurora on Groom Lake,
accidentally succeeded in video-taping the first flight [which we have been
calling the 'Old Faithful'] of [a] mysterious object while standing at the
mailbox area and looking due south toward Jumbled Hills. The footage, taken
with a night-scope vision camera, was broadcast nationally on NBC Nightly
News with Tom Brokaw on April 20, 1992. The NBC News reported that it had
video-taped a test flight of a new U.S. aerial craft that had definitely
defied the laws of physics, and that the news team may thus have taken the
first glimpse of the other 'deep black' projects [aside from the Aurora
project] being conducted within the confines of the top-secret facility.

"Also in regards to the ongoing program, it is to be noted that usually a
day or two prior to significant test flights [i.e., only if the test flight
is a significant one, by whatever measure known only to the installation] a
vehicle-traffic counter is laid on Highway 93, at approximately a mile and
a half north of Ash Springs, right before the juncture of Highway 375. The
other counter is set up about a half mile or so west upon entering Highway
375. The obvious question is: in such desolate, less-traveled areas of
Nevada, why should there be such traffic counters installed on undivided,
lonely highways? It is now my belief that the number of cars being
registered that head out west on Highway 375 at such times [particularly in
'clusters', such as caravans] is relayed to several of the security posts
at AREA 51, including the main observation post high atop the previously
mentioned Bald Mountain. However, it is very possible that they may now
have more sophisticated devices for registering the number of vehicles
going through the area.

"The February 21, 1990 expedition was instrumental in the subsequent
production of a two-hour documentary program entitled 'Saturday Super
Special' televised throughout Japan on March 24, 1990 which was seen by
more than 28 million viewers on prime time. The entire program dealt with
AREA 51 and also the crew's pursuit of an alleged biogenetics laboratory
thought to be located just outside of DULCE, a tiny town in northwestern
New Mexico, about 95 miles northwest of Los Alamos.

"...The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory...seems to have a Parapsychology
Research Unit that coordinates its research activities with DARPA [the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]. It is my understanding that
some of their activities conducted under the auspices of the Office of
Naval Intelligence are being held at locations such as AREA 51.

"ELF [extremely low frequency] wave-emitting devices, scalar machines,
electromagnetic beam weapons and highly-defined hologramic projections are
just a few examples of the many new types of mind-control 'weaponry' that
the government seems to have developed in the past three decades or so.
Newest researches on special types of hallucinatory and memory-tampering
drugs are part of a growing 'arsenal' that the U.S. Naval Intelligence
boasts to have developed in its own Parapsychology - Mind Control Unit.

"According to recent information provided to me by a highly reliable
informant within a special operations group of the Department of the Navy
[D.O.N.], two of the most widely used devices will be R.H.I.C. [Radio
Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control] and E.D.O.M. [Electronic Dissolution of
Memory]. The first of the two, Radio Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control, calls
for the implantation of a very small, electronic, micro-radio receiver. It
acts as a Stimulator which will stimulate a muscle or electronic brain
response. This, in turn, can set off a 'Hypno-programmed' cue in the victim
or subject, which would illicit a pre-conditioned behavior. The second one,
Electronic Dissolution of Memory, calls for remotely-controlled production
within the brain of Acetyl-Choline which blocks transmission of nerve
impulses in the brain which results in a sort of Selective Amnesia.
According to this source, in the hands of certain units within the
intelligence community both of these methods are ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
USED!

"An amazing article appeared in the Los Angeles Times on May 12, 1992
announcing that Caltech scientists have recently discovered and confirmed
the presence of 'tiny magnetic particles in the brains of humans, similar
to those that have heretofore been found in other animals.' [L.A. TIMES,
Section A, page 3]. According to the Caltech researchers, it is now an
undeniable fact that every human brain contains a tiny natural magnetite
particle, even from the time of conception. Could the government,
particularly the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, have known this fact for a
long time? The answer definitely seems to be in the affirmative!

"It is interesting also to note that as of this writing, many strange,
turquoise-colored antenna-towers with triangular configurations on top, are
beginning to be constructed along key areas near the freeway systems of
many U.S. cities, particularly proliferating the Los Angeles and Orange
County areas of California. According to several reports, these
antenna-towers are presently being used as relay towers for the increasing
networks of cellular telephone systems and are being operated by such firms
as Pacific Bell and Telesis.

"Yet the most interesting aspect of the constructions of these strange
antenna-towers is that there are increasing reports that the Department of
Defense is somehow involved in this operation. The frequency waves being
utilized in the cellular telephone communications are, according to several
researchers, strikingly close to the range of frequency waves used in
several ELF emission and microwave experiments of the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory as well as D.A.R.P.A., the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency. Will these towers be utilized throughout the nation?

"...In the meantime, government-sponsored genetics researchers and
bio-technology experts at New Mexico's Los Alamos National Laboratory are
said to be conducting in-depth studies not only on the total effects of
mind-control upon human behavioral patterns but also on its possible
applications relative to such areas as genetics engineering and exploration
of the human genome.

(This may be of special interest considering the news in early 1997 out of
Edinburgh, Scotland of the successful cloning of an adult Ewe lamb. There
are some who contend that certain technological breakthroughs are allowed
to leak out into the public domain only after that technology has been
harnessed and used for years by the secret scientific fraternities who
serve the agendas of the military-industrial 'elite'. It is interesting
that following the announcement of this discovery a Jesuit priest made the
rounds on the talk shows defending this 'new' science and advocating the
various 'benefits' that it could provide. It is interesting that Adam
Weishaupt who founded the Bavarian Illuminati was a Jesuit; and it is also
interesting that the Scottish Rite of Masonry originally had its origin
within the Jesuit college of Clermont in France. - Branton)

"A large underground genetics laboratory is thought to be located just
outside of DULCE, a tiny town in the midst of the Jicarilla-Apache Indian
Reservation located about 95 miles northwest of Los Alamos and 100 miles
east of [the] sinister-sounding Highway 666, the only stretch of highway in
the U.S. with that designation and the only highway that links the four
states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.

"Perhaps it may just be a pure 'coincidence' that this highway --
befittingly named Highway 666, which originated in southeast Arizona and
goes up north -- cuts into northwestern New Mexico, right near the Four
Corners area, an area that happens to have one of the most consistently
concentrated UFO sighting reports in the country since around 1947. This
entire Four Corners area, especially northwestern New Mexico and
southwestern Colorado [even extending, for that matter, to the entire
southern tip of the state] also has had some of the most concentrated
reports of unexplained cattle mutilations in the nation during the late
seventies and early eighties. Was something covertly taking place in those
areas?

"Even though we could not locate the alleged underground genetics
laboratory in Dulce when the Nippon Television crew and I visited the area
in late February of 1990, I had several opportunities to interview scores
of local residents there that admitted that nightly appearances of
mysterious lights -- [occasionally accompanied by unmarked black
helicopters] darting over, into and out of nearby Archuleta Mesa and
Archuleta Mountains -- were quite common during the late seventies and
early eighties.

"Many of them even claim to have spotted, on many occasions, military-type
trucks and jeeps as well as government vans passing through Dulce and
loitering around nearby mesas. Occasionally even black limousines carrying
what appeared to be 'CIA' agent-types were claimed to have been sighted
'loitering' around the foothills of other nearby mesas.

"We must bear in mind that the Dulce area is only 95 miles northwest of Los
Alamos. Los Alamos National Laboratory is one of the top U.S. research
laboratories specializing in the study of the human genome. Also it is a
vital center of the government's SDI research and development programs.
Just about a hundred miles southeast of Los Alamos is Albuquerque, New
Mexico's largest city, and more significantly, a city where Kirtland Air
Force Base is located right next to the sensitive Manzano Storage Facility,
a top-secret underground military facility [where nuclear warheads are
stored]. Sandia Corporation, one of the nations top-secret government
contractors specializing in top military-industrial projects, is also
located in Albuquerque.

"As far as advanced bio-technology is concerned, I have no doubt that a
micro-chip implantation technology is being perfected in which tiny
micro-chips could be implanted in our circulatory systems, vital organs and
tissues if need be for whatever purpose the future may 'require'. It is my
conclusion that a large-scale research has been completed by the government
[with possible assistance from 'outside' sources] within the last 20 years
or so utilizing tens of thousands of cattle in the Southwest to conduct
this covert experiment. Only recently has science proven that cow
hemoglobin could be substituted [by utilizing a special purification
system] with human blood in situations of 'unforeseen national
emergencies.'"
