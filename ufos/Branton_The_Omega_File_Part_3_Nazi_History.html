                                NAZI HISTORY

Following is a chronology based on research by Val Valerian of LEADING EDGE
RESEARCH, regarding the secret 'Nazi' history pre and post World War II. In
each code the first two numbers denote the year, the middle two the month,
and the last two numbers the day of the month:
140000 - Adolph Hitler 'dreams' of Germany's greatness in the world.
240000 - American [Bavarian Illuminati backed] bankers form I.G. Farben
chemical cartel in Germany.
280000 - T. Townsend Brown discovers electrogravitic capacitance effect.
291000 - U.S. undergoes economic collapse, planned by the Bavarian
Illuminati.
300000 - Dr. Henry Coanda begins work on Lenticular Aeroform designs.
330000 - Adolf Hitler Takes power. All outstanding German scientists forced
to work in Nazi laboratories.
340000 - Germans producing pilotless aircraft.
350000 - German research program on aerial warfare advances by spectacular
leaps.
350100 - German experimental rocket research at Reinickendorf and
Kummersdorf West.
350600 - American named Wilson [whose non-traditional theories on
aerodynamics are rejected by the American government and established
scientific organizations as unrealistic] comes to aid German aerial
research programs. 350622 - Research at Reinickendorf and Kummersdorf West
in Germany moved to Thuringia.
360000 - Standard Oil Company [which later becomes EXXON] builds refinery
in Germany.
370000 - Germans recover crashed disk. Work begins on German disk program
based on recovered 'alien' technology. 380000 - Standard [EXXON] Oil sends
I.G. Farben 500 tons of lead additive for gasoline.
390000 - Germans working on mini-television for bomb / rocket guidance.
390802 - Germany and Soviets sign PACT against Poland. (Note: The Communist
dictator Vladimir Lenin was originally an agent of the German government
who was smuggled into Russia from Germany by train to incite the Bolshevik
Revolution. Lenin, no doubt speaking for his Bavarian masters, stated that
: "First WE will TAKE Russia, next we will CAPTURE the nations of eastern
Europe, then we will TAKE the masses of Asia. Finally, we will surround the
United States and that last bastion of freedom will fall into our hands
like over-ripe fruit." In spite of this treaty, Hitler invaded Russia to
the absolute devastation of Stalin. It may have been that the Jesuit
advisors who worked within the Nazi S.S. according to Edmund Paris, put
pressure on Hitler to invade Russia because the Roman church considered the
Greek Orthodox church of Russia to be its enemy, after having broken away
from Rome in earlier times and declaring itself an independent force. -
Branton)
390901 - Germany invades Poland.
390901 - Soviets invade Poland.

430000 - CIA's Allen Dulles [Bavarian Illuminati] cuts a deal with Nazi SS
intelligence. This would eventually lead to a massive infiltration of the
CIA by Nazi S.S. agents, who would in turn begin a global program of
toppling third world governments and replacing them with their own fascist
puppet dictatorships.Germans complete research on alloy of magnesium and
aluminum.

Kugelblitz, minus engines, blown up by SS personnel to prevent the design
from falling into the hands of the Allies.
450225 - Workers at Kahla complex brought to Buchenwald and gassed so as
not to reveal secret of Nazi disk projects. Kahla closed. Slavian
slave-laborers from various underground facilities also taken to Karshagan
and other camps and killed.
450400 - General Hans Kammler disappears from Germany.

investigation [six UFOs, and men-in-black, sighted] following which a
reporter, and two Army G-2 agents carrying 'slag' samples to
Wright-Patterson AFB, die mysteriously. Some of the same names connected to
Maurey Island, Fred. L. Crisman in particular, mysteriously turn up years
later in connection with the J. F. Kennedy assassination. Maurey Island
later considered possible experimental test of Nazi - Project Paperclip -
CIA antigravity craft, and the JFK assassination an apparent attempt to
implement a fascist coup d'etat within the Executive branch of the U.S.
Government.
470923 - Secret briefing to Gen. Schulgen from Lt. Gen. Twining says disks

510410 - Truman relieves General MacArthur of his command and replaces him
with Gen. Ridgeway, a CFR member. MacArthur earlier disobeys U.N.
directives by initiating a secret attack on the Communist stronghold at
Inchon [leading to a quick end of the war], after he and other military
leaders suspected the pro-Socialist U.N. officials of betraying their
battle plans to the North Koreans. Truman goes into hiding at Camp David
for two weeks following MacArthur's return, fearing that the
highest-ranking military general in the United States would arrest him for
treason. After Truman fires MacArthur for his unauthorized military action,
he recieves much condemnation from confused and angered patriotic Americans
who criticize Truman for his decision.
52-'55 - Rise in 'contactee' encounters. Many of the contactees such as
George Adamski, William Dudley Pelley, George Hunt Williamson and others
found to have pro-fascist ties with American Nazi movements [see:
MESSENGERS OF DECEPTION, by Jacques Vallee], similar to the fascist ties
and leanings of some of the 1990's 'Ashtar' UFO cults. Contactee Reinholt
Schmidt and other Nebraskans claim encounters with disk pilots who speak
and act like German soldiers. Schmidt claims 'they' take him to secret
chambers below the Great Pyramids of Gizeh, where there are incidentally --
according to some sources -- tunnels leading down to ancient underground
facilities maintained by an 'Ashtar' group called Kamogol-II or the 'Gizeh
People', who have maintained collaboration with Orionite reptilian life
forms for thousands of years. The Germans had an established alliance with
these renegade 'Gizeh' Pleiadeans [Aldebarans] and Orions long before they
were approached by the Greys in 1933. Since the Gizeh forces also
maintained a collaboration with the Greys, the Bavarian cults were
more-or-less in collaboration with them by proxy via their alliance with
the Kamogol-II Ashtar Group. According to John Lear, these renegade
Pleiadeans intentionally 'crashed' a disk in Germany that was packed full
of technology, so that the technology could be used for the German war
efforts to bring about planetary 'de-population' and restore the dominance
of the 'Aryan' race, which this group of Pleiadeans believed themselves to
be a part of. It was the Aryan races who brought Hinduism to India during
the ancient Aryan invasion of the Indian sub-continent from the north. The
Egyptian connection may have resulted from the claims made by certain
ancient Egyptian scholars that the first Egyptians [and Mayas] were
originally navigators from India. 520929 - NATO Exercise 'Operation
Mainbrace' interrupted by [Nazi?] UFOs.
521104 - NSA: Presidential Executive Orders exempts NSA from all laws.
National Security Agency imputed with even more power and influence than

Rockefeller to group on Govt. reorganization. It was Rockefeller, in
collaboration with 'Nazi' agents, who assisted in the establishment of
MJ-12, the NSA and CIA as fronts for Bavarian Intelligence, a 'secret
government' within the Constitutional government. Many who have gotten
close to the CIA's ultimate secret -- that is the Nazi S.S. controlling
factor -- are murdered by CIA assassins. Allan Dulles, CIA Director,
approves mind control project MKDELTA. Entire German-disk-duplication
project goes underground. Thomas Townsend Brown gives Air Force demo of his
electrogravity effect. NSA James Moseley comes up with 'Earth-made devices'
theory. First government disk duplication projects succeed. Work with
Canadian government on aerial disks continues.

involved there to some degree as well as CIA-NSA involvement and a
multi-leveled base where antigrav, biogenetic, psi-warfare, and
mind-control research is being carried out to the extreme.
630000 - Kennedy issues ultimatum to MJ-12 member Gordon Gray, says he's
going to spill the beans on the whole mess [CIA disk projects,
international drug trafficking, mind control, collusion with Grey aliens,
etc.] and inform the public. Kennedy, having had to learn these facts from
the RUSSIANS, discovers that the scenario is true and threatens to
'dismember' the CIA if they don't come clean and surrender to Congressional
supervison.
