     What do the following names all have in common: Dennis
Brunnell, Stan Deyo, William Cooper, Bill Hamilton, Val Valerian,
'Commander X' and Robert Lazar?  They all allege that the
following scenario is a reality... Ever since the so-called "end"
of the NASA moon shots the U.S. "secret" government has been
involved in cover manned space exploration of this solar system
utilizing super-advanced technologies which are so revolutionary
that the secret government has chosen to tell the public little
or nothing about it.  Some of these sources even claim that an
inner core of this "secret government" have in the past worked
hand-in-claw with a race of hominoid-sauroid reptilian beings who
have given these human "elite" technology and power (over their
fellow man) in exchange for certain powers and influences which
this secret government or "serpent cult" gave these alien beings
over the masses of humanity.  There are allegedly other human
groups, native to earth and much more ancient, who left this
planet in ancient times after obtaining similar technologies. 
Some of these ancient and modern groups "sold out" to this alien
race in exchange for technology (as in the case of the so-called
MIB's or Men In Black), while others developed such technologies
of their own initiative (as in the case of many of the human
"alien" races who are often referred to as the "Nordics").
     As for the covert space operations that are being carried
out by various top-secret organizations within the U.S.
government, they are based on a combination of "alien" technology
recovered from numerous crash-retrievals of aerial disks, while
other aspects are based on prototype and state-of-the-art
Military-Industrial technologies developed by well-known U.S.
companies.  These advanced technologies include anti-gravity
generators and electromagnetic propulsion systems and massive
top-secret space efforts which have largely been financed through
deception and through hundreds of billions of dollars which have
generously (although unknowingly) been provided via 'Black'
budgets by hard-working American taxpayers. 
     Dennis Brunnell, a 33rd degree Mason and a Grandmaster
in the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) had become "dis-
illusioned" by the Illuminati's present activities.  Originally
believing that the Illuminati was a mystic lodge designed to
illuminate one into mystical heights of ascended awareness, he
eventually learned that such metaphysical talk was just so much
hot air designed to gain the willing assistance of lower-ranking
"lodge" members, who were unknowingly being manipulated into
serving the hypocritical, self-seeking and self-serving
imperialistic goals of a relatively small inner core of
"illumined" members.
     Some years ago a man by the name of John Todd, a member of a
family who were high-level and generational members of a druidic
witchcraft cult, alleged that through his occult contacts he was
chosen to be initiated into a deep-level Illuminati lodge.  He
claimed that in doing so he had to "unlearn" much of the wiccan
philosophies which he was taught at a young age.  These occult
teachings were merely a means, he soon found out, of this inner
core of initiates to control the lower ranks of the lodge.  This
inner core, which consisted of 13 individuals, were (he claims)
THE LEADERS of all the large wiccan/witchcraft organizations AS
WELL AS the leaders of World Freemasonry.  These men controlled
BOTH movements from their lofty positions, along with much of the
world's drug trafficking, and had powerful influence in world
economic and political movements.  Mr. Todd soon learned that
this inner core were continually fearful that the lower-ranking
members of the occult societies would turn against "them" if the
lower members ever found out that this inner council were merely
using these "lower pawns" to increase their own wealth and their
god-like power and authority over the rest of humanity.  The
Rothschilds of London, he also learned, were at the very heart of
this conspiracy, along with the Jesuits in Rome.  The Rothschilds
were considered to be "human gods" by many occultists and,
according to Mr. Todd, were in constant communication with
"Lucifer", who they themselves considered to be god.  There are
also indications, as we will give later in these texts, that they
were/are also in contact with the serpent race as well, which
would make them an integral part of the "serpent cult".
     Dennis Brunnell, John Todd and in fact millions of former
Communists, realized that there was an incredible contradiction
between what these world socialists were telling their
"followers" and what these inner elite were actually practicing. 
The connection we make between Illuminism and Communism (which is
still very strong in mainland China) is no coincidence, as both
are socialist movements.  Also, according to well-known geo-
political analysts such as Dr. John Coleman, Karl Marx himself
had known ties with 33rd degree Masonry and the Jesuit Order.  As
for John Todd, he later "defected" from this secret lodge after
he "suggested" to the other members that in light of recent
events the prophecies of the Bible should be studied.  Their
answer to this, he claims, was a murderous stare from most if not
all of the other members of this council of 13.  He believes he
was lucky he got out of there alive.  These men, apparently, did
not even want to consider the possibility that the Holy Bible
could be true, for they knew well enough that it was against
every imperialistic and deceitful practice that they were
involved in.  John Todd later became a Christian and spoke to
various audiences around the country until, according to some
sources, he was later assassinated.
     Brunnell alleged that some within the Illuminati were so
heartless as to believe that their socialist "World Order" must
be brought about even if the orchestrating of wars, etc., had to
be accomplished in order to create the conditions necessary for
establishing it... or, in other words, that the end justified the
means.  These lost souls were and are apparently convinced that
they have the divine right to decide the fate of nations, and
that the masses of humanity exist for no other reason than to
serve their cause.  They consider themselves "gods" and the rest
of humanity as "mere mortals".  So much for the end-result of the
false promise that was given to man by the serpent race as
revealed in Genesis chapter 3, which was that men could be as
gods, and that the creature could be independent from or equal to
the Creator.  The serpent race knew full well that the dis-
connection of man from their trust and reliance in the Godhead
would result in lost power and dominion over the earth and the
beasts, including the serpent race, and as a result the
reptilians could take control of that which mankind forfeited,
including man himself!  Since that ancient time the saurians have
been able to find those among humanity who would be willing to
believe their false promises in exchange for temporary physical
gains.
     One of Dennis Brunnell's "Gemstone" research papers (which
also described the Mafia-CIA-oil company connection to the John
F. Kennedy assassination, confirming the original "Gemstone"
reports of Bruce Roberts) included a scenario developed by
Kissinger and other Illuminists in the early 1980's or before. 
This scenario showed one such proposed plan as to how war could
be used to bring the United States - the last obstacle standing
in the way of absolute Illuminati rule of the world - into
subjection to the one-world Socialist state.  This scenario,
possibly one of many developed, was in the form of a speech given
by a U.S. president.  George Bush was sited as a very possible
candidate to this "speech" (This was years before Bush became
vice president, which suggests that Brunnell was in fact
tapped-into some very sensitive information).  It was basically
written as a possible emergency address to the nation which would
supposedly take place after years of American involvement in an -
Illuminati orchestrated? - war in the Middle East.  The scenario
continued as "the President" informs the nation that, due to the
long drawn-out (Korea/Vietnam like no-win) war which has depleted
our national resources, a certain Executive Order was to be
issued for the "good" of the nation which would result in
practically ALL PRIVATE AGENCIES coming under the absolute
control of the Federal Government.  In short, according to this
scenario, if such a plan was carried out then the entire nation
could be brought under absolute socialist control in one night.
     Such a scenario may not be too far-fetched when we realize
the following: 1) George Bush was, during his years at Yale
University, initiated into the "Skull & Bones" society, also
known as the "Brotherhood of Death".  According to prominent
political and financial analysts such as Antony Sutten, there is
much documentation to suggest that Skull & Bones is nothing less
than a Western branch of the Bavarian Illuminati, designed to
recruit highly-educated individuals into serving it's cause; 2)
George Bush served as THE DIRECTOR of the CIA for several years,
which, according to various sources, is actually serving the one-
world movement; 3) Bush has very close ties with one-world
organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations or C.F.R.,
Federal Reserve, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, Alpine
Institute, etc.; 4) Before Ronald Reagan "chose" a running mate,
according to the late Gary Allen, he was approached at a
political convention by the duo of Walter Cronkite and Henry
Kissinger, both alleged Illuminists, and "strongly encouraged" to
choose George Bush as his running mate as Bush was well-favored
by the International Banking Establishment of Wallstreet; 5) The
Bush family is very rich and are heavily involved in high-profit,
offshore oil drilling companies.
     6) Also, when news of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait - where
the Bush family's oil business had some vested interests -
reached America, George Bush was at the one-world "Aspen"
Institute of Colorado visiting with Margaret Thatcher.  Bush's
decision to rally the nations together by sending our young men
and women to fight and die for the "New World Order", was based
on "advice" he received from officials at the one-world Aspen
Institute.  Although "Operation Desert Storm" was a well-planned
and well master-minded attack, the fact nevertheless remains that
we were fighting to defend the "New World Order" and the oil
interests (whereas we only get a very small percentage of our oil
from Kuwait) and not to defend the constitutional United States. 
This war was a two-sided event.  Even though the motive may have
been other than in harmony with America's best interests in that
(like Korea and Vietnam) it was fought FOR the Socialist-oriented
United Nations; some good nevertheless came out of it, in
essence, that America was able to defend ISRAEL from an
aggressive enemy, something which Almighty God most likely
honored.  However the target, Saddam Hussain, escaped free while
tens of thousands of his subjects, so many pawns in a huge game
of chess, had to pay the price with their lives.  As the Word of
God says, "evil shall slay the wicked" (Psalm 34:21).  This may
in part apply to Iraq, the land of ancient Babylon (the ancient
city where the one-world movement and all occult movements had
their genesis) which in a strange twist of fate was "judged" by
the very oppressive movement which it created.  Notice also
Bush's constant references to the "New World Order" - a concept
which is a mockery of the Declaration of INDEPENDENCE which our
forefathers shed their blood to defend.  True, we must as a
nation not ignore the rest of the world, yet at the same time we
should not surrender ourselves to the rest of the world either,
but preserve the American Republic as a bastion of Freedom to
which the oppressed of ALL NATIONS can take refuge.
     The reason we are so critical of this particular presidency
is because we believe that the secret government - utilizing it's
influence in mass-media control, MANIPULATED Bush into office in
a direct perversion of the electorial process.  In other words,
through the fantastic media power which they wielded, the one-
worlders snuffed out the competition.  We realize that it is
Biblical to honor the governing officials, yet this is only to
the EXTENT that the governing powers submit to the Almighty
governing power of the Universe, God Himself.  Elijah criticized
the ancient King Ahab for this very reason, because he was
leading the nation of Israel astray into Baal worship. 
Unfortunately, King Ahab and George Bush may have had a lot in
common.  We would rather hope that the opposite were true, but
facts are facts.  However, we must not fall into the trap of
pointing the finger at any one person, as Bush happens to be only
one link in a very large and very powerful "secret government"
chain which, as we have seen, has sold out much of this planet to
"The Beast".  Bush, like many misled "insiders", was no doubt
largely a product of his environment, as well as a member of a
generational "Establishment" family, and more-or-less a puppet or
voicebox of secret government policy.  This fact should be taken
into account, as well as the fact that the major "enemy" is the
draconian influence as it exists in and behind the secret
government establishment.  There were, nevertheless, less-than-
honorable motives on the part of the United States in it's
decision to fight in the Gulf War (see: YOUTH ACTION NEWS - Oct.
1990., Box 312., Alexandria, VA  22313 - this source gives much
evidence that Bush and Company more-or-less "encouraged" the
Kuwaiti invasion and, when faced with irrefutable proof that such
an invasion was coming, did absolutely nothing to warn the
Kuwaitis or the Iraqis against such an invasion.  Was Bush and
Company willing to risk the lives of thousands of people just so
his One World Government could be established and a "trial run"
of the global U.N. Police Force could be initiated?).
     According to Dr. John Coleman (World Intelligence Review.,
Box 426., Metairie, LA  70004), the ancient Babylonian Serpent
Cult, or what is known today as the "Illuminati" (33rd degree
Freemasonry) is under the direct control of some very nefarious
forces.  Coleman in fact provides much evidence that 33rd degree
Masonry has been used not only to infiltrate and take over many
political, economic and religious institutions, but has also been
used to "create" such institutions as well, organizations to
which people will flock and submit their power and energies to
unknowingly serve an agenda that they know nothing about.  This
was and is carried out through the 22 "Palladium" Lodges which,
according to various sources, can be traced back to the Grand
Masonic Lodge in England.  According to Coleman and many others,
the Grandmasters of Masonry AND of Jesuitism (ie. the Illuminati)
are working together in this conspiracy.  In many cases the
individuals involved are both Jesuits AND Masonic initiates. 
Such was the case of Guisseppi Mazzini, who was a Jesuit-Mason,
and a satanist-witch to boot, and was second-in-command to the
Masonic "Pontiff" Albert Pike - whose rotting remains now lie
beneath the "House of the Temple" in Washington D.C. (see Dr.
Coleman's tapes: CONSPIRACY CULTS AND THE ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT,
and FREEMASONRY AND THE ONE WORLD CONSPIRACY).
     Other works that may be very revealing along this line, as
we indicated earlier, are the writings of former 33rd degree
Mason and former Past Master of all Scottish-Rite Masonic bodies,
the Rev. Jim Shaw.  This is especially true with his book THE
DEADLY DECEPTION (P.O. Box 884., Silver Springs, FL  32688).  In
this work Mr. Shaw exposes the blatant SERPENT worship secretly
taking place within the Masonic HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE in Washington
D.C.  Mix this with the accounts of "Masonic" street-outlays
built into Washington D.C. itself and accounts of tunnels beneath
the city which connect many of the important Federal buildings
and which allegedly extend to extreme depths and distances, then
you have a recipe for something very strange and sinister which
is undermining our nations capitol.  No wonder the Christian-
Patriots within the American Republic have had to fight "the
enemy within" for so long with so little apparent results from
their efforts.
     Concerning Bush's one-world policies, we will quote here
from a few letters to the editor which appeared in various issues
of the UTAH COUNTY JOURNAL, as confirmation of some of the
statements which we have previously made.  One letter, appearing
in the April 30, 1991 issue of the U.C.J., stated:
     "Editor:  The April-May '91 issue of COMMON CAUSE reports
that the first successful exploration for oil in Kuwait was done
by the Zapata Oil Co., of which current President George Bush was
a founder and director.  The President's son, George W. Bush, is
now the third largest insider stockholder in another off-shore
oil drilling company located in Bahrain, 15 miles from Saudi
Arabia.  This is Harken Energy Corp., with its home base in
Bedford, Texas.
     "Does this information explain the Rambo-like "hurry up" war
in Kuwait?  Does it explain marked shifts in acceptance or
castigation of Saddam Hussein?  Does it offer an explanation for
the terrible destruction of the Kuwait oil fields and Persian
Gulf waters?  Do these two leaders really have the welfare of
their respective peoples at heart?  I would give anything to read
one of the history books on this war written 25-50 years hence. -
Eugene J. Faux; Provo."
     And in the Feb. 26, 1991 issue of the same publication:
     "Editor:  In the Feb. 12 issue of the JOURNAL an obviously
well-intentioned lady suggested that we pray for President Bush
because he has 'awesome responsibilities.'  
     "He has, indeed, many awesome responsibilities: a
responsibility to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution; a
responsibility to weed out those in our government who, by intent
or neglect, work to undermine the Republican form of government
given to us by our founding fathers; a responsibility to tell the
American people the TRUTH about the incredible, rapidly
escalating national debt and what the debt will mean to our
children and our children's children 'unto the seventh
generation' and beyond.  He also has a responsibility to expose
the hypocrisy of those who are working diligently to bring about
a new constitutional convention, supposedly to propose one or two
new amendments, while they already have entire new constitutions
written and waiting. - Albert V. Burns; Spanish Fork."
     Another letter which appeared in the UTAH COUNTY JOURNAL
during the Bush-Iraq controversy, Mar. 5 1991 issue, stated:
     "Editor:  Mrs. (Colleen D.) brought up a very good point
about my criticism of George Bush and his New World Order agenda.
Rightfully, as a leader of a nation, he might be considered
exempt from censure for any mistakes that he might make through
oversight or a lack of proper information.  Unfortunately, this
is far from the case with Bush.
     "Sadly, the president is very cognizant of his actions and
exactly where these actions are speedily leading us - to a world
government ruled by elitist insiders.  History can conclude
nothing less than this result.  For a complete analysis of Bush,
his political history, and his leadership of the Council on
Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, I
enthusiastically recommend the new book on George Bush - THE
ESTABLISHMENT MAN, available through The John Birch Society. 
Well documented, this book will put to rest any remaining praises
for our chief executive.
     "In fact, my critique of the executive is founded upon my
patriotism, not turning against it.  President Teddy Roosevelt
stated: "Patriotism means to stand by the country.  IT DOES NOT
MEAN TO STAND BY THE PRESIDENT OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIAL SAVE
EXACTLY TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF STANDS BY THE COUNTRY. 
It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves
the country.  It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact
extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to
stand by the country."  As Bush has repeatedly violated his oath
to defend the Constitution, I will continue to patriotically
reproach his intentions.
     "As for being in the White House when Bush sent National
Security Adviser Brant Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing immediately and secretly after
the Tienamen Square massacre, no, I was not present when he made
that call.  That's why we have the press.  The White House
announced that such was the case on Dec. 18, 1989, to anyone
listening.  Such betrayal of freedom-fighters is par for the
course when we look at Bush's policy toward other people seeking
liberty, but receiving only his true objective: World despotism
in his New World Order. - Bruce J. Martin."
     In relation to the above concern of whether we should
unquestioningly trust our elected (?) heads of state, it is
interesting that of all the presidents which have been in the
White House since the assassination of John F. Kennedy (which
many allege was actually an Illuminati-inspired coup), EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF THEM have been supportive of the one-world
government movement as it is incarnate in the Council of Foreign
relations and allied global organizations.  Coincidence?
     Finally, we have this letter from the September 18, 1990
issue of the same publication:
     "Editor:  In his September address to the nation, President
Bush stated his five objectives for the massive deployment of
U.S. troops.  The fifth is the fundamental reason for this
operation.  As Mr. Bush stated himself, "The crisis in the
Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity
to move toward a historic period of cooperation.  Out of these
troubled times, our fifth objective - a new world order - can
emerge... We are now in sight of a United Nations that performs
as envisioned by its founders."
     "The U.N. 'founders' included U.S. communist traitor, Alger
Hiss, who was the acting secretary general of the conference in
San Francisco in 1945.  Hiss was accompanied by a contingent of
U.S. communists and a swarm of Council on Foreign Relations
members.  The communists wanted world government by revolution
and the others wanted it by way of socialism.  In either case,
these individuals did not want national sovereignty of the kind
fought for by our founding fathers.
     "The fundamental difference between a "new world order"
under the United Nations and an independent United States are
nowhere clearly indicated than in our DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
affirmation that "men are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights."  The UN's total exclusion of God means that
rights do not come from God, (but) that they proceed from
government, and government can and will take them away.
     "Our country has suffered in the past from U.N. decisions
and action.  U.N. advocates gave away all the gains our fighting
men bled and died for in Europe and Asia after World War II.  We
fought Korea and Vietnam under U.N. sanction and command with
victory denied even though over 100,000 men lost their lives and
hundreds of thousands were wounded (in addition to this, several
sources allege that communist nationals working within the U.N.
constantly betrayed U.S. positions and strategies to their allies
in North Korea, and repeated this betrayal during the Vietnam
conflict as well.  It is a fact that the MAJORITY of the "United"
Nations Secretary Generals have also been communist nationals -
Branton).  Nixon and Kissinger operating under "new world order"
dictates gave South Vietnam to the communist enemy after our
military fought so valiantly even with the treasonous
restrictions imposed on them.
     "Now, George Bush wants the men and women of our armed
forces to die... for the new world order... George Bush's drive
for a "new world order" is not worth ONE DROP of American blood. 
But blood we shall have until we once again elect
constitutionalists to office instead of one-worlders. - Mike
Thomas; Pleasant Grove."
     The January 26, 1990 issue of THE NEW FEDERALIST revealed
even more about the Bush - one world connection.  In his article,
BUSH'S CHINA POLICY: SKULL AND BONES, Joseph Brewda writes:
     "Jan 19 (EIRNS)--An obscure secret society known as "Skull
and Bones" may have more to do with George Bush's obsessive
support of Beijing's mass murderers than one may think.
     "Skull and Bones is a secret fraternity at Yale University
which is restricted to a mere fifteen student members per year. 
The society was formed in 1832 by General William Russell, whose
shipping firm later dominated the U.S. side of the China opium
trade.  Yale University was founded by Eli Yale, who made his
fortune working for the opium smuggling British East India
Company.
     "Skull and Bones became the recruiting grounds and preserve
of the most important New England-centered families--families who
also made their money in the opium trade.  These families, whose
sons regularly join Skull and Bones, include the little known,
but powerful, Coffins, Sloanes, Tafts, Bundys, Paynes, Whitneys. 
They are a dominant element of the U.S. 'Eastern Establishment'
to this day.  The Bush family is one of a cluster of lower-level
Establishment families controlled by these interests.
     "What has this to do with Bush policy towards China--or for
that matter, Bush's "War on Drugs"? (Note: the last television
news reporter to ask Bush a critical question concerning the many
narcotics agents who are complaining about how bad the "drug war"
was going, was promptly fired from his job shortly after the
press conference - Branton)    
     "George Bush, the first U.S. diplomatic representative to
the People's Republic of China back in 1973, was a member of
Skull and Bones.  So were his father, brother, son, uncle,
nephew, and several cousins.  Winston Lord, the Reagan-Bush
administration Ambassador to China was a member; so were his
father and several other relatives.  James Lilley, the current
Ambassador to China, was a member of Skull and Bones, as was his
brother.  Except during the Carter administration, every U.S.
Ambassador to Beijing since Kissinger's deal with Mao Zedong was
a member of the same tiny Yale cult.  A mere coincidence?
     "MAO WAS A YALIE - Back in 1903, Yale Divinity School
established a number of schools and hospitals throughout China
that were collectively known as 'Yale in China.'  It has since
been shown that 'Yale in China' was an intelligence network whose
purpose was to destroy the republican movement of Sun Yat-sen on
behalf of the Anglo-American Establishment.  The Anglo-American
"Establishment" hated Sun, because he wanted to develop China. 
On the other hand, they loved the Chinese communists because they
intended to keep China backward, and were committed to growing
dope.  One of 'Yale in China's' most important students was Mao
Zedong.
     "During World War II, 'Yale in China' was a primary
instrument used by the U.S. Establishment and its Office of
Strategic Services (OSS) to install the Maoists into power. 
'Yale in China' was run by OSS operative Reuben Holden, the
husband of Bush's cousin, and also a member of Skull and Bones.
     "The Maoists made China into the world's largest opium
producer.
     "'Yale in China' was also closely associated with the New
York-based Union Theological Seminary, which has been a center
for U.S. subversion of Asia (literal wolves in sheeps clothing -
Branton).  Every prominent radical leader operating in Korea
today, for example, was trained at Union Theological.  Union
Theological was dominated for twenty years by Henry Sloane
Coffin, a U.S. intelligence executive from the Sloane and Coffin
families.  He was a Skull and Bones member as were a dozen of his
relatives.
     "Nor should it be forgotten that Averell Harriman, the
former Ambassador to Moscow who did so much to build up the
Soviet Union, was a member of Skull and Bones.  Harriman was also
a business partner of Prescott Bush, Sr., the father of Maoist
enthusiast George Bush."
     Note: This Skull and Bones - Communist connection is also
confirmed by geopolitical and economics researchers such as Dr.
Antony Sutton (Sutton's books may be obtained through THE PATRIOT
REVIEW., 33836 SE Kelso Rd. #6., P.O. Box 596., Boring, OR 
97099; OR via THE MIDNIGHT MESSENGER., P.O. Box 472., Altadens,
CA  91001).  Not only did the Skull and Bones (Western
Illuminati) help to build up the Communist movement in China, but
they gave considerable financial aid to the Soviet Union
communists as well.  According to Sutton, this power cult has for
centuries been playing a "two ends against the middle" type of
game, attempting to control America (the thesis) and Russia (the
anti-thesis) and other countries or movements, carefully pitting
them against each other at the lower levels in order to keep the
populations of the world in a state of confusion and despair, to
the point that they will - hopefully - resign themselves into
accepting the New World Order "synthesis" as the only alternative
to solve the very "problems" which THEY, the New World Order
initiators, created in the first place!  One startling, though
documented, claim which Mr. Sutton makes is that the Nazi
Movement was largely financed by the Skull and Bones - Illuminati
as well.  This connection was recently described in a mailer
describing Val Valerian's book MATRIX III (c/o Leading Edge
Research., P.O. Box 481-MU58., Yelm, WASH  98597).  Part of this
mailer states:
     "Interspaced with the material comes a host of data,
supplementary material, interviews, and revealing information. 
The 'Final Scenario' is discussed relative to the New World Order
and the plans for total economic control, a one-world religion,
and the electronic mind control objectives, schools of thought,
and research.  MATRIX III brings out in detail how various
families in the United States and Europe are also involved in a
scenario which has as its main tenet the suppression and
elimination of human beings on many levels - a scenario which
includes worldwide traffic of drugs, vast laundering of drug
money by national banks of several countries, and assassination
and murder.  These are the people who arranged and supported all
the wars.  There is discussion of the Bush family, and how
Prescott Bush assisted the finance and management of the Nazi
empire - the so-called Hitler project..." 
     Much of Valerian's writings are very well-documented and can
be followed-up, yet the only criticism of his work which we have
deals with the fact that, we believe, he has placed too much
confidence in so-called "channeled" revelations as sources of
information.  We believe, based on past experience and research,
that much of the information received through so-called "trance
channels" should be discarded for several reasons: 1) Such
information is often self-contradictory. 2) Channeled revelations
often contradict "revelations" received through other "channels".
3) There are supernatural beings inhabiting the aerial realm
whose very purpose and "assignment" is to counterfeit "divine"
revelation in order to spread propaganda, confusion or mislead
the seeker from the truth.  This is often, we have found,
accomplished by offering the seeker a substantial amount of
"truth" in order to uphold one strategic lie. 4) Channeled
information in most cases cannot be followed up by physical
documentation or evidence. 5) There are many indications that
non-human beings, both supernatural and reptilian, are utilizing
occult channels in order to carry out propaganda warfare against
those who possess the truth.  As we will see in later writings
there is also much evidence that these alien beings have utilized
witchcraft and occult movements (ie. the serpent cults) since the
earliest times in order to further their reptilian cause.
