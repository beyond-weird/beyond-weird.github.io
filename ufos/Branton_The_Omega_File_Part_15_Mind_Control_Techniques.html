           MY ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF THE GROUP IN THE MID-1980s
                          MIND CONTROL TECHNIQUES
I encountered the Group as a result of a personal investigation into a very
strange series of deaths and bizarre behavior changes I observed among my
acquaintances in a chemical factory that produced raw materials for
plastics manufacture. All I knew at the start was that about 50 [now 100]
employees had died of leukemia, aplastic anemia, various forms of cancer,
and other illnesses that fit with only two possible causes: long-term
exposure to benzene or to low-level radiation. The pattern included a
series of sudden, unexpected heart attacks among spouses of dead or dying
workers who asked questions about the cause of their husbands' deaths.
Since the plant supposedly had no radioactive materials, I litigated a
large-scale case on the assumption that the only possible cause was
benzene. About 3 years after the case was over [I won it.], a series of
employees there began exhibiting bizarre behavior changes. One of them
privately confided in me, and her confidences caused me to open a very
private, personal investigation. I determined that this woman and a second
female employee had been subjected to some form of trauma under hypnosis by
several men connected with the plant's MEDICAL staff. Both men had
participated in what seemed a NAZI group called [the] ORDER OF THE FOURTH
REICH. Both of the women were interrogated under hypnosis by the experts
referred to earlier, under my direction. During the first 18 months of
interrogations we learned that a form of "mind control" was used on the
women and MANY other plant employees, as well as on my main [male]
informant to conceal the covert manufacture of an illicit product at that
factory. The Group's agents used a "mind control" method that concealed
their observations and memories of its production from THEMSELVES. Here is
how it worked: Employees' trust was gained by the Group's agents in the
plant medical department. When the employees were called in for medical
exams or given 'medication' by the plant physician and some of his staff,
the employees were instructed in methods they were to use to forget events
they had observed at the plant. The employees were taught to "remember to
forget" incidents that the Group's agents did not want them to recall. In
some cases these instructions were accompanied by physical torture under
drugged hypnosis until the employee complied with the instructions. The
subject is highly technical, but the end result was the concealment of a
witness's memory from the witness's own consciousness, except in a hypnotic
state.

TRAINING OF UNCONSCIOUS ASSASSINS ALSO KNOWN AS 'U-BOATS,' INCLUDING
OSWALD, SIRHAN, possibly RAY, & MANY OTHERS LIKE THEM: The subject cannot
possibly [be] treated in the short space I have left. Bare bones: Victims
are drugged into regression to early childhood. They are subjected to
incredible pain, many expiring in the process. The natural response to the
levels of pain DR. MENGELE had perfected was dissociation of the conscious
mind. In that state they were given new, GERMAN names and trained as one
would train a killer guard dog. They kill on command. THEY ARE
ARTIFICIALLY-PRODUCED 'MULTIPLE' PERSONALITIES. One of the top people in
their development appears to have been Sirhan Sirhan's psychiatrist, DR.
DIAMOND. There were other prominent psyche folks in on it. They have no
memory of the kill, except when prompted by the proper stimuli. Mengele
told my informant THAT HE personally did the training on Oswald. Location
unknown, but we suspect Mexico City in Summer, 1963. [The] CIA gave John
Marks [Search for Manchurian Candidate] what appears to be a real hokey,
perhaps forged or fabricated, "field report" for the initial field test of
an unconscious assassin in Mexico City in July, 1963 [see Marks' book, p.
190]. I suspect that if someone can get that file and bust a few balls,
they'll find the memo given to Marks in his FOIA litigation was a
substitute for one that named Oswald and depicted a successful
'experiment.' The likely control of the project we suspect to have been
GEHLEN, but the CIA Director mentioned above may have also played a major
role. Oswald was trained as a 'patsy' only. He fired no shots. Sirhan was
given the full course. His back-up was a man posing as a guard. Ray [who
killed Martin Luther King] had the Oswald-type training...

(Note: According to several sources, the United Nations Organization or UNO
is deeply involved in this fascist global conspiracy. Just note the
controversy surrounding former U.N. Secretary General and Austrian Kurt
Waldheim concerning his Nazi past and allegations that he is a war
criminal, although he adamantly denies this. An interesting personal
connection came from an individual whom I was in contact with some years
ago, by the name of Tawani Shoush. Shoush claimed to be a full-fledged Nazi
who served on a German U-Boat during World War II. In fact he served -- if
we are to believe his story -- on one of two German U-Boats which turned up
in Argentina several months after the war, and from there he moved to North
the United States. He claims to maintain contact with a secret Nazi
S.S.-connected Society which reputedly has retrieved the "Spear of Destiny"
which so fascinated Adolph Hitler, after it had been hidden in an ice cave
in Antarctica following the end of the war. Shoush claims to have seen the
spear for himself, and claims that this secret S.S.-connected Society has
been using it as the center-piece of occult rituals which are being carried
out in an effort to loosen the spiritual forces that will lead to the
establishment of a European Alliance, with Germany at the center, and
especially as a means to summon a "great leader" who will rise out of
Europe and finish the work that Adolph Hitler began. He called this group
"The Order". Incidentally he has also written and published information in
the form of a "Lost Diary" of Admiral Richard E. Byrd telling of Byrd's
supposed visit with a friendly race of 'Aryans' called the 'Aryanni' --
whom Shoush also claims to be in contact with -- at the North Pole. Some
people, for instance Harley Byrd, claim that Shoush is a Nazi agent who is
trying to conceal the existence of hostile Nazi and Alien forces at the
SOUTH Pole by diverting attention to supposedly friendly 'Aryanni' UFOnauts
at the NORTH Pole. It is strange that this 'Diary', which is most likely a
hoax, has the 'benevolent' Aryanni telling Admiral Byrd of the evils of
nuclear weapons and how we should disarm our nuclear arsenal to avoid a
global holocaust. At the same time, according to this 'Diary', these
supposedly benevolent people bid the Admiral farewell in GERMAN. In
addition, in the 'diary' the Aryanni referred to their craft as
'FLUGELRADS', which is the German word for 'Wing-Wheel'. Harley Byrd claims
that the Admiral did NOT meet with aliens at the North Pole... it was the
SOUTH pole where he encountered what Harley insists was a collaboration of
Nazi's, Greys, Draco, rebel Pleiadeans and a few collaborating 'Sasquatch'
people as well. However in order not to divert from the flow, the United
Nations Connection's of the Nazi's -- via Kurt Waldheim and others -- are
historical fact. One source other than Shoush even reported that at one
point Kurt Waldheim himself was in possession of the 'Spear', suggesting
that this former U.N. Secretary General wasn't a small fry but a MAJOR
player in the Nazi conspiracy. This might explain the following article
which suggests that the "National Socialists" have already begun the early
stages of their attempted takeover of North America. - Branton)
