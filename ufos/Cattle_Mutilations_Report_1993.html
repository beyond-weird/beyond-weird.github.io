                          INTRODUCTION

Beginning in November of 1992, the Fyffe Police Department has been conducting
an investigation into unexplained cattle mutilations in cooperation with
neighboring police and law enforcement agencies. These reported incidents began
on October 20, 1992 and have continued through the last week in Marshall and
DeKalb counties.

To date over thirty (30) animals have been discovered dead in pastures with
various internal and external organs missing. The incisions examined on there
animals exhibit a precise surgical cutting. In many of the cases there has been
evidence of extremely high heat at the tissue excisions. The absence of
physical evidence adds to the mystery at the majority of mutilation sites.
Though many animals have been found in soft pasture land, and in many cases
mud, there have been no footprints, tracks, or marks found anywhere near the
mutilated animals.


To date no police agency has established a suspect or motive for these
incidents of phantom surgery perpetrated on area livestock. Neither has an
eyewitness or informant come forward to offer any credible insight or
testimony.

The first documented incident of cattle mutilation was reported on October 20,
1992 by Albertville cattle farmer John Strawn. The animal was discovered in a
wooded area of Mr. Strawn's pasture by a neighbor who found the animal dead,
lying on its side. The animal's entire milk sac was missing with no evidence of
blood on the animal, nor on the ground where it lay. The neighbor said the
neat, oval incision where the udder had been removed appeared to be charred.

Other farmers in the Albertville area soon started reporting similar cases over
the next two months. The same organs were reported missing, though what was
taken varied from animal to animal. In many cases the rectum had been cored out
neatly, with no evidence of blood or body fluid present. On female livestock
the sex organs had been removed in an identical fashion with clean, bloodless
incisions. On male livestock, the sex organs had also been removed, again in
oval, bloodless incisions. In early January Albertville Police Department's
Chief of Detectives, Tommy Cole, reported that his ranch, too, had fallen
victim to the mutilators when a Black Angus steer fell prey to the phantom
surgeons. It was at that point that the Fyffe Police Department began working
closely with the Albertville Police Department to further investigate the
continuing incidents of mutilations.


A week after Chief Detective Cole reported his steer, the mutilations struck
again in Albertville. The next week mutilated cattle were reported near Fyffe
in Grove Oak A week later, in Dawson, just outside of Fyffe. During the first
week in February, 1993, more than nine (9) cases of mutilations were
discovered and reported in Marshall and DeKalb counties.

Throughout all the cases, cattle farmers and their neighbors reported seeing
or hearing helicopters in the vicinity either before or shortly after
mutilated cattle were discovered.

Comparison to other cattle mutilations documented by law enforcement in
forty-eight (48) other states since 1963 shows that the cases recently
documented here in northeast Alabama are part of a national problem.


In over ten thousand (10,000) reported cases of livestock mutilations reported
since 1967, the organs and tissue taken are always the same. Sex organs
removed, tongue cut deep into the throat and removed. Individual eyes and cars
or sometimes both have been excised. The jaw stripped to the bone in a large
oval cut and all tissue cut clean. Rectums are cored out, almost like a
stovepipe had been inserted and all the tissue and muscle has been pulled out.

All of this has been accomplished on these thousands of animals with no
evidence of blood present at the incision in some cases the entire blood supply
of the animal had been drained, yet without cardio-vascular collapse.

Throughout the documented history of these cattle mutilations, no one has ever
been charged or prosecuted with the crime. No one has ever been caught.

Recently many area residents and public officials have offered multiple causes
and suspects they believe may be responsible for these animals wounds. Some say
it's predator animals like coyotes or buzzards. Many people believe it's the
work of a satanic cult or of college students. Never evidence collected and
analyzed by Ph.D. scientists of material collected from local animals and
pastures clearly rules out both groups.

                          TWO SIGNIFICANT CASES

On January 31, 1993, a rancher in the Dawson Community led investigators to the
carcass of a Black Angus cow. The animal's genitals and rectum had been cored
out in one large incision that left a hole the size of coffee can. The animal's
jaw had been completely stripped in an oval incision that encompassed The
entire right side of the animal's face. The tongue was completely gone, cut
deep down into the throat. There was no blood present on the animal itself, nor
on the ground surrounding it.

Further examination revealed a flaky white material on the animal's right rib
cage and on the ground five (5) feet from the carcass. The material was placed
in the empty wrapper of a cigarette pack and transported to the Fyffe Police
Department where it was transferred to a glass jar. While removing the flaky
particles from the cigarette wrapper, the material came in contact with the
brass tip of a ball-point pen.  Within one second of contact with the brass,
the material melted into an almost clear liquid. To reduce the risk of this
happening to the remaining material, the rest was shaken out into a jar where
it remained unaffected. This white, flaky material was then air expressed to a
molecular biologist at a leading eastern University for analysis.

After two tests, the scientist determined that the substance was composed of
aluminum, titanium, oxygen and silicon in significant amounts. He stated that
the amount of titanium was larger than he would ever expect to see in any
substance and that there was no way this combination of elements could ever
occur in nature. This material has now been sent to another scientist for a
second opinion. When this second analysis is completed we will release his name
and the major eastern university responsible for the analyses.Included in
your press package is the preliminary analysis, a photograph of the substance
and the technical read out on its composition.

The second significant case in these incidents of livestock mutilations
occurred on February 7,1993. This time in Crossville, Alabama. Cattle farmer
David McClendon noticed during his morning head count that he was missing a
three-week-old calf. He went searching for and found the animal in a wooded
area dead with a large portion of its right hind quarter missing. Examining the
animal, Mr. McClendon found that all the calf's internal organs were missing
and all that he could see was the clean, empty chest cavity. There was no sign
of blood on or near the animal. There were no teeth marks on the tissue nor on
the exposed leg bones. David McClendon called local and county law enforcement.
Shortly after they arrived the county deputy stated that the animal had been
killed by predators and left. Mr. McClendon wasn't satisfied that this was what
happened to his animal and later that day he brought the calf to the Fyffe
Police Department for a second opinion. A first look at the calf gave the
impression that the animal had been eaten on by wild animals, but a closer look
revealed something else, according to Oliphant.

The entire edge of the animals wounds were straight and even, There was no
evidence of tearing, ripping, or chewing anywhere. Below the right leg joint
the hide had been cut in a square, with two (2) right angle incisions. Close
examination (videotaped) showed that the actual incision appeared to be
serrated, almost like steps with notches at each base. During the initial
examination of the calf, six (6) tissue samples were taken from the animal and
preserved in Mason jars. These tissue samples were sent to Dr.John Altschuler,
formerly of the University of Colorado, who now runs his own state of the art
pathology and hematology laboratory. Dr. Altschuler states that all six (6)
tissue samples he examined from

David McClendon's calf had been exposed to high heat, the tissue had been
cooked. Dr. Altschuler said the temperature required to do this would have to
be in "the hundreds of degrees and possibly higher" to burn the tissue in this
manner. As for the 'stepped and notched' incisions, Dr. Altschuler stated that
since he examined the first mutilated animal back in 1967, he has seen this
type of cut over and over again.



                                 CONCLUSION

With these two lab reports of two different samples in two separate cases, we
are forced to conclude that the predator animals cannot be blamed for the
majority of the mutilation cases documented.

Dr. Jim Armstrong, Auburn professor of zoology and wildlife science concurs. He
states, "It would be obvious if a coyote have been tearing through. The wounds
would not be similar to a smooth cut. Coyotes bite through and pull to tear
away the flesh. It would have a 'chewed on look'. There are other scavenger
animals such as vultures that will eat at the softer regions of a cow, but
there's not going to be these clean, surgical-type cuts. There is no way a
coyote or other predator inflicted those wounds." In the past week Dr.
Armstrong has examined dozens of photographs of mutilated cows taken by the
Fyffe Police Department. He states, "I went over the pictures with a USDA
expert along with several wildlife biologists. With the exception of one
individual, we all agreed that many of the cases were not typical predatory
damage. The caution here is that we're dealing with photos, that there is no
other physical evidence for us to look at. "But the USDA agent and most other
agreed with my conclusion that many of the pictures were not coyote or other
predator damage."


DeKalb County Auburn Extension Agent Curtis O'Daniel also discounts the
likelihood of predator animals removing circles of cowhide. "Predators are not
bad about eating hide, they'll eat up the rest of it first. Along with the
bons, the hide will be one of the last things to go."

These statements made by expert professionals agree with the statements made
earlier this year by the Fyffe Police Department, that predators are not
responsible for the mutilations. The conclusion, however, indicates a greater
mystery: Who is doing this and why is there a lack (for the most part) of
physical evidence at the scene?

Police Chief Junior Garmany and Mayor Boyd Graben, themselves involved in
farming, believe the results of our investigation require further attention It
is incumbent on all of us Military, state andfederal government to assists
farmers to find out who the phantom surgeons are. It seems basic to help the
man who is responsible for ensuring there is food available for our dinner
tables. The farmer is not interested in politically correct official
explanations. He wants to know what has happened to his livestock It should be
the responsibility of all law-enforcement to join together to find an answer to
this problem that is adversely affecting the cattle farmer, here in Alabama.
