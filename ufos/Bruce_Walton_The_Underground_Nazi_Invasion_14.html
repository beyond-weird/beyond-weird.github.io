The term "eugenics" is taken from the Greek to signify "good birth" or
"well-born," as in aristocrat. Its basic assumption is that those who
are not "well-born" should not exist.

International Congress of Eugenics, Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., N.Y.:

January 21, 1932

Dear Dr. Davenport:

I will be only too glad to put you in touch with the Hamburg-American
Line .. they may be able to co-operate in making suggestions which
will keep the expenses to a minimum. I have referred your letter to
Mr. Emil Lederer [of the Hamburg-Amerika executive board in New 
York] with the request that he communicate with you.

Davenport to Mr. W.A. Harriman, 59 Wall Street, New York, N.Y.

January 23, 1932

Dear Mr. Harriman:

Thank you very much for your kind letter of January 21st and the
action you took which has resulted at once in a letter from Mr. Emil
Lederer. This letter will serve as a starting point for correspondence,
which I hope will enable more of our German colleagues to come 
to America on the occasion of the congresses of eugenics and
genetics, than otherwise.

The battle cry of the New Order was sounded in 1935 with the
publication of "Man the Unknown," by Dr. Alexis Carrel of the
Rockefeller Institute in New York. This Nobel Prize-winner said
"enormous sums are now required to maintain prisons and insane
asylums.... Why do we preserve these useless and harmful beings?
This fact must be squarely faced. Why should society not dispose
of the criminals and the insane in a more economical manner? ...
The community must be protected against troublesome and dan-
gerous elements.... Perhaps prisons should be abolished.... The
conditioning of the petty criminal with the whip, or some more
scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would
probably suffice to insure order. [Criminals, including those] who
have ... misled the public on important matters, should be humanely
and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions sup-
plied with proper gases. A similar treatment could be advantageously 
applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts."

Carrel claimed to have transplanted the head of a dog to another 
dog and kept it alive for quite some time.

CHAPTER 4: "THE CENTER OF POWER IS IN WASHINGTON"

During his political career, George Bush has claimed many different
"home" states, including Texas, Maine, Massachusetts, and Con-
necticut. It has not been expedient for him to claim Florida, though
that state has a vital link to his role in the world, as we shall see.
And George Bush's home base in Florida, throughout his adult life,
has been Jupiter Island.

The unique, bizarre setup on Jupiter Island began in 1931, following
the merger of W.A. Harriman and Co. with the British-American firm
Brown Brothers.

The reader will recall Mr. Samuel Pryor, the "Merchant of Death." A
partner with the Harrimans, Prescott Bush, George Walker, and Nazi
boss Fritz Thyssen in banking and shipping enterprises, Sam Pryor
remained executive committee chairman of Remington Arms. In this
period, the Nazi private armies (SA and SS) were supplied with
American arms -- most likely by Pryor and his company -- as they
moved to overthrow the German republic. Such gun-running as an
instrument of national policy would later become notorious in the
"Iran-Contra" affair.

 / Note #b|"Walter S. Carpenter, Jr." had been chairman of the finance
committee of the DU PONT Corporation (1930-40). In 1933, Carpenter
oversaw DU PONT's purchase of Remington Arms from Sam Pryor and
the Rockefellers, and led DU PONT into partnership with the Nazi I.G.
FARBEN company for the manufacture of EXPLOSIVES. Carpenter 
became DU PONT's president in 1940. His cartel with the Nazis was 
broken up by the U.S. government. Nevertheless, Carpenter remained 
DU PONT's president, as the company's technicians participated mass-
ively in the Manhattan Project to produce the first atomic bomb. [Any 
connection to the 'Order of the Fourth Reich's' alleged use of a well-known 
'chemical' company -- such as DU PONT or ARCO? -- to built plastique 
'nuclear' neutron bombs, as detailed in an earlier file? - Wol.] He was 
chair-man of DU PONT from 1948 to 1962, retaining high-level access 
to U.S. strategic activities.

 / Note #b|"C. Douglas Dillon" was the boss of William H. Draper, Jr.
in the Draper-Prescott Bush-Fritz Thyssen Nazi banking scheme of
the 1930s and 40s. His father, Clarence Dillon, created the Vereinigte
Stahlwerke (Thyssen's German Steel Trust) in 1926. C. Douglas Dillon
made "Nicholas Brady" the chairman of the Dillon Read firm in 1971 and
himself continued as chairman of the Executive Committee. C. Douglas
Dillon would be a vital ally of his neighbor Prescott Bush during the
Eisenhower administration...

Prescott Bush was Dwight Eisenhower's favorite golf partner. Prescott
could reassure Ike about his counselors, allay his concerns, and
monitor his moods. Ike was very grateful to Prescott, who never re-
vealed the President's scores.

The public image of his relationship to the President may be gleaned
from a 1956 newspaper profile of Prescott Bush's role in the party.
The "New York Times," which 11 years before had consciously PROTEC-
TED him from public exposure as a Nazi banker, fawned over him in an
article entitled, "His Platform: Eisenhower": "A tall, lean, well-dressed
man who looks exactly like what he is -- a wealthy product of the Ivy
League -- is chairman of the Republican Convention's platform committee.
As such, Prescott Bush, Connecticut's senior United States Senator,
has a difficult task: he has to take one word and expand it to about
5,000...

George Bush left Greenwich Country Day School in 1936. He joined his
older brother at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, 20 miles
north of Boston. "Poppy" was 12 years old, handsome, and rich. Though
the U.S. economy took a savage turn for the worse the following year,
George's father was piling up a fortune, arranging bond swindles for
the Nazis with John Foster Dulles...

The hierarchical top banana of the AUV secret society in George's
1942 Andover class was Godfrey Anderson ("Rocky") ROCKEFELLER.
In the yearbook just above the AUV roster is a photograph of "Rocky
Rockefeller" and "Lem [Lehman F.] Beardsley"; Rockefeller stands
imperiously without a shirt, Beardsley scowls from behind sunglasses.
Certainly the real monarch of George Bush's Andover secret society,
and George's sponsor, was this "Rocky'|"s father, "Godfrey S. Rocke-
feller."

The latter gentleman had been on the staff of the Yale University
establishment in China in 1921-22. Yale and the Rockefellers were
breeding a grotesque communist insurgency with British Empire
ideology; another Yale staffer there was Mao Zedong, later the
communist dictator and mass murderer. While he was over in China,
Papa Godfrey's cousin Isabel had been the bridesmaid at the wedding
of George Bush's parents. His Uncle Percy had co-founded the Harriman
bank with George Walker, and backed George Bush's father in several
Nazi German enterprises. His grandfather had been the founding
treasurer of the Standard Oil Company, and had made the Harrimans
(and thus ultimately George Bush) rich...

Bush's open public advocacy of government measures tending towards
zero population growth was a radical departure from the policies built
into the federal bureaucracy up until that time. The climate of opinion
just a few years earlier, in December 1959, is illustrated by the com-
ments of President Eisenhower, who had said, "birth control is not our
business. I cannot imagine anything more emphatically a subject that
is not a proper political or governmental activity . .. or responsibility."

As a congressman, Bush played an absolutely pivotal role in this
shift. Shortly after arriving in Washington, he teamed up with fellow
Republican Herman Schneebeli to offer a series of amendments to the
Social Security Act to place priority emphasis on what was euphemis-
tically called "family planning services." The avowed goal was to reduce
the number of children born to women on welfare.

Bush's and Schneebeli's amendments reflected the Malthusian-
GENOCIDALIST views of Dr. Alan Guttmacher, then president of PLAN-
NED PARENTHOODP, and a protege of its founder, MARGARET
SANDER [Note: Rush Limbaugh's description of Sanger and her class
as "feminazis" might be taken more literally then was originally intended. 
- Wol].  In the years before the grisly outcome of the Nazi cult of race 
science and eugenics had inhibited public calls for defense of the "gene 
pool," Sanger had demanded the weeding out of the "unfit" and the "inferior
races," and had campaigned vigorously for sterilization, infanticide and 
abortion, in the name of "race betterment." [Sanger is also behind the
false idea that the right of a human being to be born is outweighed by
a females "Constitutional Rights to Choose".  They do have a "right" 
to choose -- to use contraception to keep themselves from becoming
pregnant!  However when a woman does become pregnant she has
committed to a responsibility to care for her child.  When a human 
being's heart stops beating they are legally 'dead', so in the same way
should not life begin when a human heart STARTS beating?  Why is 
it that a person can get a life sentence if he beats a new-born child to 
death; yet if that same child is only partially born and it is dismembered 
while it's head is still in the vaginal passage -- it is merely 'partial birth
abortion' and the doctor who performs the 'operation' is hailed as a
hero by Faminazis like Sanger who scream raging curses at PRO-
LIFERS because they are against women's 'rights' while at the same
time being VERY CAREFUL not to expose their TRUE reasons for 
advocating abortion -- the EXTERMINATION of all "unworthy" non-white 
races such as Hispanics, Blacks, Jews... etc. - Wol."]

Although Planned Parenthood was forced, during the fascist era and
immediately thereafter, to tone down Sanger's RACIST rhetoric from
"race betterment" to "family planning" for the benefit of the poor and
blacks, the organization's basic goal of curbing the population growth
rate among "undesirables" NEVER really changed. Bush publicly 
asserted that he AGREEDD "1,000 percent" with Planned Parenthood.

During hearings on the Social Security amendments, Bush and witness
Alan Guttmacher had the following colloquy:

"Bush": Is there any [opposition to Planned Parenthood] from any other
organizations or groups, civil rights groups?

"Guttmacher": We do have problems. We are in a sensitive area in
regard particularly to the Negro. There are some elements in the Negro
group that feel we are trying to keep down the numbers. We are very
sensitive to this. We have a community relations department headed
by a most capable Negro social worker to try to handle that part of 
the problem. This does, of course, cause us a good bit of concern.

"Bush": I appreciate that. For the record, I would like to say I am
1,000 percent in accord with the goals of your organization. I think
perhaps more than any other type of organization you can do more
in the field of poverty and mental health and everything else than any
other group that I can think of. I commend you.

Like his father before him, Bush supported Planned Parenthood at
every opportunity. Time after time, he rose on the floor of the House to
praise Planned Parenthood's work. In 1967, Bush called for "having the
government agencies work even more closely with going private agencies
such as Planned Parenthood." A year later, he urged those interested
in "advancing the cause of family planning," to "call your local Planned
Parenthood Center" to offer "help and support."

...As we have seen, George Bush inherited his obsession with popula-
tion control and racial "down-breeding" from his father, Prescott, who
staunchly supported Planned Parenthood dating back at least to the
1940s. In fact, Prescott's affiliation with Margaret Sanger's organization
cost him the Senate race in 1950...

Prescott's 1950 defeat still rankled, as shown by Bush's extraordinary
gesture in evoking it during testimony he gave on Capitol Hill before
Senator Gruening's subcommittee of the Senate Government Operations
Committee on November 2, 1967. Bush's vengeful tirade is worth quoting
at length:

"I get the feeling that it is a little less unfashionable to be in favor of
birth control and planned parenthood today than it used to be. If you
will excuse one personal reference here: My father, when he ran for
the U.S. Senate in 1950, was defeated by 600 or 700 votes. On the
steps of several Catholic Churches in Connecticut, the Sunday before
the election, people stood there passing out pamphlets saying,
'Listen to what this commentator has to say tonight. Listen to what
this commentator has to say.' That night on the radio, the commen-
tator came on and said, 'Of interest to voters in Connecticut, Prescott
Bush is head of the Planned Parenthood Birth Control League,' or
something like this. Well, he lost by about 600 votes and there are
some of us who feel that this had something to do with it. I do not
think that anybody can get away with that type of thing any more."

Bush and Draper

As we saw in Chapter 3, Gen. William H. Draper, Jr. had been director
and vice president of the German Credit and Investment Corp., serving
short-term credit to the Nazi Party's financiers from offices in the
U.S.A and Berlin. Draper became one of the most influential crusaders
for radical population control measures. He campaigned endlessly for
zero population growth, and praised the Chinese COMMUNISTS for their
"innovative" methods of achieving that goal. Draper's most influential
outlet was the Population Crisis Committee (PCC)-Draper Fund, which
he founded in the 1960s...

In 1901, the discovery of large oil deposits in Texas offered great
promise for the future economic development of the state, but also
attracted the Anglo-American oil cartel. The [James A.] Baker family
law firm in Texas, like the Bush and Dulles families in New York, was
aligned with the HARRIMAN-ROCKEFELLER cartel.

The Bakers were prominent in supporting eugenics and utopian-feudalist
social engineering. Captain James A. Baker, so the story goes, the
grandfather of the current boss of Foggy Bottom, solved the murder of
his client William Marsh Rice and took control of Rice's huge estate.
Baker used the money to start Rice University and became the chairman
of the school's board of trustees. Baker sought to create a center for
diffusion of racist eugenics, and for this purpose brought in Julian Huxley
of the infamous British oligarchical family to found the biology program
at Rice starting in 1912. / Note #2 Huxley was the vice president of the
British Eugenics Society and actually helped to organize "race science"
programs for the Nazi Interior Ministry, before becoming the founding
director general of UNESCO in 1946-48.

James A. Baker III was born April 28, 1930, in the fourth generation
of his family's wealth. Baker holdings have included EXXON, MOBIL,
ATLANTIC RICHFIELD, STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA, STANDARD
OIL OF INDIANA, KERR-MCGEE, MERCK and FREEPORT MINERALS. 
Baker also held stock in some large New York BANKS during the time 
that he was negotiating the Latin American debt crisis in his capacity 
as secretary of the treasury...
