                The Federal Emergency Management Agency


Although an excellent article, the January 1995 edition of Monitoring
Times magazine published only a tiny portion of what FEMA has
been tasked by Executive Order to perform.  FEMA was brought into
existance by E.O.  All the frequencies I have for FEMA follow my
comments here:

Federal Emergency Management Agency (F.E.M.A.) (and other
emergency agencies):

F.E.M.A. (Federal Emergency Management Agency) has been authorized
for the past 15 years by Presidential Executive Orders to confiscate ALL
PROPERTY from the American People, separate families in the current 
43 internment camps (already built and operational by the way, 5 of which
are located in Georgia.  The largest can confine somewhere on the order
of 100,000 American citizens), called relocation camps by the 'government',
for assignment to work camps; declares martial law and TOTALLY OVER-
RIDES the U.S. Constitution.  Presidential Executive Orders that are related 
or control this are given at the end of this.  Two of the state prisons here in
Georgia are currently empty, although manned by a minimul number of staff, 
have been setup and intentionally unpopulated by prisoners just to support 
this political policy.

Concentration (internment) Camps.  An Executive Order signed by then
President BUSH in 1989 authorized the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (F.E.M.A.) to build 43 primary camps (having a capacity of 35,000
to 45,000 prisoners EACH) and also authorized hundreds of secondary
facilities.  It is interesting to note that several of these facilities can accom-
modate 100,000 prisoners.  These facilities have been completed and many 
are already manned but as yet contain no prisoners. (Remember all the 
TALK of over-crowded prisons that exist...).  In south Georgia there are 
several state prisons that except for a few guards, are completly devoid
of prisoners.

Under F.E.M.A., the Executive Orders which are already written and is
the current law of the land, calls for the COMPLETE suspension of the
United States Constitution, all rights and liberties, as they are currently
known.  The following executive orders, which are in the Federal Register
located in Washington DC for anyone to request copies of, call for the
suspension of all civil rights and liberties and for extraordinary measures
to be taken in, as most of the orders state, "any national security emer-
gency situation that might confront the government."  When F.E.M.A. is
implemented, the following executive orders will be immediately enforced:

E.O. 12148 - FEMA national security emergency, such as: national
disaster, social unrest, insurrection, or national financial crisis.

E.O. 10995 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL communications media
in the United States."

E.O. 10997 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL electric power, petrol-
eum, gas, fuels and minerals, both public and private."

E.O. 10998 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL food supplies and
resources, public and private, and ALL farms, lands, and equipment."

E.O. 10999 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL means of transportation,
including PERSONAL cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and TOTAL
CONTROL over all highways, seaports, and waterways."

E.O. 11000 - "... provides for the SEISURE OF ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE
for work forces under federal supervision, including SPLITTING UP OF
FAMILIES if the government has to."

E.O. 11001 - "... provides for government seizure of ALL health, education
and welfare functions."

E.O. 11002 - "... designates the postmaster general to operate a national
REGISTRATION of all persons."  (Under this order, you would report to
your local post office to be separated and assigned to a new area.  Here
is where families would be separated).

E.O. 11003 - "... provides for the government to take over ALL airports
and aircraft, commercial, public and PRIVATE."

E.O. 11004 - "... provides for the Housing and Finance Authority to
relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned and establish
new locations for populations."

E.O. 11005 - "... provides for the government to TAKE OVER railroads,
inland waterways, and public storage facilities."

E.O. 11051 - "... the office of Emergency Planning (has) complete
authorization to put the above orders into effect in time of increased
international tension or economic or financial crisis."

All of the above executive orders were combined by President NIXON
into Executive Order 11490, which allows all of this to take place if a
national emergency is declared by the President.  The burning and
insurrection in Los Angeles in the case of Rodney King could have
executed (and partially did execute) these Executive Orders.

Executive Order 12919:  "National Defense Industrial Resources Pre-
paredness" signed by CLINTON June 3, 1994, delegates authorities,
responsibilities and allocations of F.E.M.A.'s Executive Orders (last
entry) for the confiscation of ALL PROPERTY from the American people,
and their re-location and assignment to "labor" camps.  The Executive
Order also supersedes or revokes eleven (11) previous Executive Orders
(from 1939 through 1991) and amends Executive Order 10789 and 
11790. This executive order is A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE by the [Secret] Government of the United 
States in concert with the UNITED NATIONS.

Operation Dragnet.  Janet Reno can implement this operation upon re-
ceiving one call from the President.  Arrest warrants will be issued via
computer to round-up over 1 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS who may
'resist' the NEW WORLD ORDER.  Americans who are not 'politically
correct.'  Specifically mentioned are CHRISTIANS or those who read the
Bible.  Concentration/internment camps have already been built to accom-
modate these American prisoners.  See above paragraph as these intern-
ment camps have been setup and are run by F.E.M.A.

Operation Rolling Thunder.  Reno and Benson have mentioned this opera-
tion which comprises county-wide sweeps of house to house, dynamic
entry, search and seizures for all guns and food stockpiles by B.A.T.F.,
state national guard, activity duty soldiers, as well as local police.  This
function is also run and coordinated through F.E.M.A.

Public Law 100-690 banned almost ALL RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS [not
yet enforced..]. (Note: When and if this is enforced, this will be a blatant
defacation upon the BILL OF RIGHTS, and in this event every true American
is allowed -- and in fact it will be his and her Patriotic DUTY -- to implement
the clause within the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE to OVERTHROW
such an alien or FOREIGN tyranny-structure which has infested the govern-
ing body of America. - Wol.); grants no-knock search and seizures with a
search warrant; expands the drug laws to include EVERY American.  This
will generally be the prelude, or in addition to, a F.E.M.A. operation and 
contingency plan emplimentation.

The Omnibus Crime Bill of 1990.  Ensures confiscation of all private property
via money laundering, environmental violations of the Clean Water and Air
Act, and extends as far as child abuse.  This act also coordinates activities
through F.E.M.A. and the Department of the Army, Commanding General,
U.S. Forces Command, Fort McPherson, GA which is the executive and
implementing agency upon initiation of many of these acts.  The responsible
agency within U.S. Army Forces Command was what used to be known as
the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans Division (DCSOPS, Plans),
which was changed several years ago to J-3 after the Headquarters became
a joint headquarters.  They keep on file copies of all F.E.M.A. Emergency
Management Operation Plans, including those plans developed by the Army
to support the F.E.M.A. plan to eliminate the U.S. Constitution upon imple-
mentation.  According to current plans, the Constitution will be 'temporarily'
discontinued and shelved until the real or perceived and declaired 'threat'
has been neutralized (ask yourself -- who or what is the REAL threat that
need to be neutralized? - Wol.).  But once 'shelved,' as with almost every 
other action of the Government, it STAYS shelved.

The Crime Bill of 1994.  Banning of all military weapons which are neces-
sary to the formation of a militia (when needed), denies other military
equipment to the people's militia units [that OK... the average American
gun owner can legally aquire this 'equipment' from off the DEAD BODIES 
of FEMA-backed gestapo forces when they break-in to our homes to steal 
our personal property or try to take us and our families prisoner without 
due process of law. - Wol], prelude to confiscating ALL guns in the hands 
of private citizens, DESTROYS the 1st Amendment, and makes virtually 
every American an outlaw.  See above comments concerning the house-
to-house search.  The agency responsible for the actual implementation 
and search is the Department of the Army in concert with local and state 
police, including F.E.M.A., FBI, BATF, and other Federal Agencies.

SECRET UNDERGROUND BASES.  There have been documented over 
60 secret, VIRTUAL CITIES, UNDERGROUND, build by the government, 
Federal Reserve Bank Owners [such as the "Rockefellers", etc. - Wol], 
and high ranking members of the Committee of 300 (some of these under-
ground areas can be seen in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, 
Kansas).  In additional, there exist underground Satellite Tracking Facilities 
which have the ability to punch your 911 address into the computer and 
a satellite can within seconds bring a camera to bear on your property to 
the point that those monitoring can read a license number on an automobile 
in your driveway.  These facilities have as of Oct 1, 1994, been turned over 
to the [foreign power of the] UNITED NATIONS.

Captain John Pinedo of the Pasadena Fire Department graciously 
led a presentation and tour... of the non-military communications 
facilities brought in to the Rosemont Pavillion for the World Cup. 
These included the State of California Office of Emergency Services 
Ku-band VSAT trailer-mounted telephone terminal and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency Multi Radio Vehicle.  The Multi 
Radio Vehicle was particularly interesting  as it contains:

Redundant 25 KVA diesel alternators

An environmental control system good for -25 C to +60 C

Three Harris RF 350K 500 W auto-tune 1.6 MHz to 29.999 MHz 
transceivers

A Motorola MCX-1000 VHF repeater with PL, DPL (digital PL), DES 
(Data Encryption Standard), and DVP (Digital Voice Protection)

A Motorola SPECTRA UHF repeater with PL, DPL, DES, and DVP

A Motorola SPECTRA 800 MHz/900 MHz repeater with PL, DPL, 
DES, and DVP capable of both conventional and trunked operation

Four Magnavox VRC-83 HF/VHF/UHF multi-mode military aircraft radios

=================================================
So, the next time you run something on FEMA, use some or all of 
the material mentioned above.  This agency is probably one of the 
MOST DANGEROUS in the Federal government in terms of violating 
the Constitution as well all American's Constitutional Rights.

As indicated above, this agency's main purpose is to TOTALLY 
RESTRAIN Americans making the internment of a few thousand 
Japanese during WWII look like a playground exercise.
