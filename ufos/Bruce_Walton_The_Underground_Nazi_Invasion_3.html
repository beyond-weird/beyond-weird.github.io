The following letter was written by an anonymous source in Germany, and
addressed to conspiracy researcher K. Van Hoof of Wisconsin:

"...[a] South African 'insider' recently wrote, that the big crash is
expected either in 1995 or in 1996... If the crash does come, it might
[this time] well end up in a worldwide economical disaster with tens of
thousands of companies going bankrupt. "...The Insider also tells about
Clinton possibly planning a war against Iran, which America of course would
fight for Israel. Again, if that really should come about, that might be
the war which, according to prophecy, will come BEFORE World War III (in
the oil region, it was announced) and which the USA will loose, because the
enemy will have Russian support. "And finally, the Insider also said that
your American patriots are beginning to worry the One Worlders. Have you
found out anything about what happened in Oklahoma? A Brazilian magazine
wrote about the 'empty stare' of the fellow who did it... I wonder if they
hypnotized or drugged him and then made him do this, in order to be able to
dis- perse the group [to disperse the militia to which he 'apparently' had
connections], or worse. If you read the papers, no matter where from, these
people are all 'Lunatics, paranoids, neonazis.' The methods used are the
same! "To conclude, the Insider tells about an escalation of the war in
Yugoslavia, which might very well end up in WWIII. Remember, WWII also
started in that country. Serbia, always has been and is England's
'darling', whereas Croatia was and is considered a protege of Germany. This
dates back to the times of the Holy Roman Empire. [Note: The last official
'emperor' of the Roman Empire and the first 'pontiff' of the so-called
'holy' Roman Empire was Constantine, who also served as the Supreme Pontiff
or PONTIFEX MAXIMUS of the Babylon Mystery Society, as was the tradition of
most Roman Emporors. The Pontifex Maximus is supposed to be an unbroken
line of Babylon Mystery Cult leaders who trace their line all the way back
to Nimrod's Babylon. The present-day Pontifex Maximus positions are
concealed from the general public for obvious reasons - Wol.] Croatia has
always been faithful to the Catholic emperors and its soldiers always
fought in a row with the imperial armies, f.i. in the 30 years war against
the Protestants. This, and their being Catholics, they are obviously not
forgiven by certain people. Besides, they always were and in a way still
are the bulwark of Catholicism against the East, first against the Turks,
but also against the Greek Orthodox enemies of Catholicism. Serbia, being
Orthodox, always had the support of Russia. The religion question plays an
im- portant part in the troubles of that region... "So, the war against
Croatia indirectly also is directed against the Germans, which means both
Germany AND Austria in the historical context. "I thought, this might
interest you, as you generally don't hear much about these things in the
media. Besides, you have to know history, if you want to understand what's
going on, and in the US you probably don't study European history that
much."

GEORGE WASHINGTON'S VISION OF THE FUTURE:

The Xeroxed page from which the following information is taken gave credit
to the following book as being the source-reference for the article:
"George Washington's Vision & Prophecy For America" -- THE MICHAEL BENN
SPECIAL REPORT., P.O. Box 671054., Dallas, TX 75367:

(quote) ...Various accounts of George Washington's vision and pro- phecy
all agree in content. There have been only minor variations in some details
as the story was repeated over the years by those to whom it was related by
General Washington. The place is Valley Forge, in the cold and bitter
winter of 1777. Washington's army had suffered several reverses and the
situation was desperate. Food was scarce. The Continental Congress was not
sending supplies or money. Some of the troops did not even have shoes to
wear in the snow. Many soldiers were sick and dying from disease and
exposure. Morale was at an all-time low and there was great agitation in
the Colonies against continued effort to secure our freedom from England.
Never-the- less, General Washington was determined to see the struggle
through. These are the words of a first-hand observer Anthony Sherman, who
was there and describes the situation: "You doubtless heard the story of
Washington's going to the thicket to pray. Well, it is not only true, but
he went often to pray in secret for aid and comfort from God, the
interposi- tion of whose Divine Providence brought us safely through the
darkest days of tribulation. "One day, I remember it well, when the chilly
winds whistled through the leafless trees, though the sky was cloudless and
the sun shown brightly, he remained in his quarters nearly all the
afternoon alone. When he came out, I noticed that his face was a shade
paler than usual. There seemed to be something on his mind of more than
ordinary importance. Returning just after dusk, he dispatched an orderly to
the quarters of the officer I mentioned, who was presently in attendance.
After a preliminary conversation of about a half hour, Washington, gazing
upon his companion with that strange look of dignity which he alone
commanded, related the event that occurred that day." WASHINGTON'S OWN
WORDS...

"This afternoon, as I was sitting at this table engaged in preparing a
dispatch, something seemed to disturb me. Looking up, I beheld stand- ing
opposite me a singularly beautiful female. So astonished was I, for I had
given strict orders not to be disturbed, that it was some moments before I
found language to inquire the cause of her presence. A second, and third
and even a fourth time did I repeat my question, but recieved no answer
from my mysterious visitor except a slight raising of her eyes. "By this
time, I felt strange sensations spreading through me. I would have risen
but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered volition impossible. I
assayed once more to address her, but my tongue had be- come useless, as
though it had become paralyzed. "A new influence, mysterious, potent,
irresistible, took possession of me. All I could do was to gaze steadily,
vacantly at my unknown visitor. Gradually the surrounding atmosphere seemed
as if it had become filled with sensation, and luminous... "[The] visitor
herself became more airy and yet more distinct to my sight than before. I
now began to feel as one dying, or rather to experience the sensations
which I sometimes imagined accompanying dissolution. I did not think, I did
not reason, I did not move; all were alike impossible. I was only conscious
of gazing fixedly, vacantly at my companion. "Presently I heard a voice
saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn.' while at the same time my
visitor extended her arm eastwardly. I now beheld a heavy white vapor at
some distance riding fold upon fold. This gradually dissipated, and I
looked upon a strange scene. Before me lay spread out in one vast plain all
the countries of the world -- Europe, Asia, Africa and America. I saw
rolling and tossing between Europe and America the billows of the Atlantic,
and between Asia and America lay the Pacific. "'Son of the Republic,' said
the same mysterious voice as before, 'look and learn.' At that moment I
beheld a dark, shadowy being, like an angel, standing, or rather floating
in mid-air, between Europe and America -- dipping water out of the ocean in
the hollow of each hand, while with his left hand he cast some on Europe.
Immediately a cloud raised from these countries, and joined in mid-ocean.
For a while it remained stationary, and then moved slowly westward, until
it enveloped America in its murky folds. Sharp flashes of lightning gleamed
through it at intervals, and I heard the smothered groans and cries of the
American people. "A second time the angel dipped water from the ocean, and
sprinkled it out as before. The dark cloud was then drawn back to the
ocean, in whose heaving billows it sank from view. A third time I heard the
mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic, look and learn.' I cast my
eyes upon America and beheld villages and towns and cities springing up one
after another until the whole land from the Atlantic to the Pacific was
dotted with them.

"Again, I heard the mysterious voice say, 'Son of the Republic, the end of
the century cometh, look and learn.' At this the dark shadowy angel turned
his face southward, and from Africa I saw an ill-omened spectre approach
our land. It flitted slowly over every town and city of the latter. The
inhabitants presently set themselves in battle array against each other. As
I continued looking I saw a bright angel, on whose brow rested a crown of
light, on which was traced the word 'Union', bearing the American flag
which he placed between the divided nation, and said, 'Remember ye are
brethren.' Instantly, the inhabitants, casting from them their weapons be-
came friends once more, and united around the National Standard. "[General
Washington hears the voice once again] saying, 'Son of the Republic, look
and learn.' At this the dark, shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth,
and blew three distinct blasts; and taking water from the ocean, he
sprinkled it upon Europe, Asia and Africa. Then my eyes beheld a fearful
scene; from each of these countries arose thick, black clouds that were
soon JOINED INTO ONE. Throughout this mass there gleamed a dark RED LIGHT
by which I saw hordes of armed men, who moving with the clouds, marched by
land and sailed by sea to America. Our country was enveloped in this volume
of cloud, and I saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn
the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up. As my ears
listened to the thundering of cannon, clashing of swords and cries of
millions in mortal combat, I heard again the mysterious voice saying, 'Son
of the Republic, look and learn.' When the voice had ceased, the dark
shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long
and fearful blast. "Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from
above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark clouds which
enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone
the word Union, and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in
the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits.
These immediately joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were
well nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up
their broken ranks and renewed the battle. "Again, amid the fearful noise
of the conflict, I heard the mysterious voice saying, 'Son of the Republic,
look and learn.' As the voice ceased, the shadowy angel for the last time
dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon America. Instantly the
dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving
the inhabitants of the land victorious! "Then once more I beheld the
villages, towns and cities springing up where I had seen them before, while
the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst
of them, cried with a loud voice; 'While the stars remain, and the heavens
send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.' And taking
from his brow the crown on which blazoned the word 'Union', he place it
upon the Standard while the people, kneeling down, said, 'Amen.' "The scene
instantly began to fade and dissolve, and I at last saw nothing but the
rising, curling vapor I at first beheld. This also disappearing, I found
myself once more gazing upon the mysterious visitor, who, in the same voice
I had heard before, said, 'Son of the Republic, what you have seen is thus
interpreted: Three great perils will come upon the Republic. The most
fearful is the third, but in this greatest conflict THE WHOLE WORLD UNITED
shall not prevail against her. Let every child of the Republic learn to
live for his GOD, his Land and the Union.' With these words the vision
vanished, and I started from my seat and felt that I had seen a vision
where- in had been shown to me the birth, progress, and destiny of the
United States."

Thus ended General George Washington's prophetical vision for the United
States of America as told in his own words. COMMENTARY: [the following
afterthoughts accompanied the text from which the above information was
taken] ...George Washington's vision had been published from time to time
and is recorded in the Library of Congress. What I have related regarding
this prophecy, as well as the ex- planations and remarks setting the
historical background of this profound event, are not original thoughts or
even initially reported facts. It has simply been my duty to set them down
in order to increase your understanding and motivation for the struggle
ahead. We are now moving rapidly into the third and greatest peril of Wash-
ington's revelation. The signs of its fulfillment are readily evident to
all who are not blinded by apathy, over-indulgence, or self-delusion.
Nations on every continent, under the political forces of Communism, are
now hostile to the United States. America has few friends left in the world
and even fewer still who will have the strength or will to stand beside her
in any future struggles. Lenin foretold the series of events: "First we
will TAKE Russia, next we will CAPTURE the nations of eastern Europe, then
we will TAKE the mas- ses of Asia. (Lenin did enter Russia on behalf of the
German government and precipitated the Bolshevik Revolution, many of the
Eastern European countries are now reverting back to Socialism even though
the barriers between East and West have fallen, and Red China has in fact
fallen to a form of Communism far more heinous than that practiced by
Russia -- where Communism itself is trying to make a come-back. So in
essence, these three agendas stated by this German agent of global
subversion have come to pass! - Wol.) Finally, we will surround the United
States and that last bastion of freedom will fall into our hands like
over-ripe fruit." In Washington's vision, he saw America attacked and
invaded by vast military forces from Europe, Asia and Africa. He saw that
[within] those forces there "gleamed a dark, red light" -- the color and
symbol of Communism. He saw our cities aflame (as a result of nuclear
attack, burned by the invading forces, or perhaps set afire by mobs
fomenting anarchy and revolution?); the whole nation devastated, and
millions dying in mortal combat. Then at the point of fiercest and final
battle, the great angel, the guardian of this nation, descended from the
heavens with legions of white spirits who joined forces with the Americans
and destroyed the invading armies... [The following quote appeared at the
conclusion of the article, although the source of the quote was unreadable
due to fading. If I recall correctly from other sources who have given this
quote, it was penned by one of the 'founding fathers' of the U.S.
Constitution. - Wol.]: "Firearms stand next in important to the
Constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and
keystone under independence. To secure peace, security and happiness, the
rifle and the pistol are equally indispensable. The very atmosphere of
firearms everywhere restrains evil interference..." (unquote)

[Note: The reference to a World Order to which the entire continents of
Europe, Asia and Africa are subject is noteworthy, especially when we
consider that Communist Socialism has infested Asia, just as Fascism
Socialism has infested Europe. Also Africa is a major stronghold for the
political Islamic movement. So then, what do Communism, Fascism and Islamic
militarism have in common? In addition to the fact that they are anti
Judeo-Christian movements and they believe in or have in the past practiced
"inquisitional" methods to expand their power, all three of them have
connections to ROME. In fact Revelation chapter 17 states that Rome, the
7-hilled city, is the Mother of all Abominations. The blasphem- ously named
'holy' Roman Empire which spanned Germany-Austria-Italy is still intent on
ruling the world. Communism was largely the creation of Guisseppe Mazzini,
a High Mason and deputy to the "Pontiff" of Uni- versal Freemasonry Albert
Pike. Mazzini was also a Jesuit Priest and a member of the Bavarian
Illuminati which was established by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, who was also a
Jesuit. The Jesuits were founded by Ignatius Loyola, who had formerly been
arrested in Spain for sub- versive activities as a gnostic -- gnosticism
itself being a neo Babylon- ian/Egyptian cult that had taken root in the
Bavaria region of Germany. Being a 'serpent cult', gnosticism has close
ties with the ancient "Cult of the Serpent" or "Babylonian Mystery
Society", which revered the Ser- pent because they considered the original
serpent to be a type of mes- siah in that it had supposedly given man the
first knowledge. Actually the Hebrew word for the tree of "knowledge" is
"Dah-ath" which literally means "cunning". The "cult of the serpent" and
the "Church of the Lamb" have been at odds since the dawn of time, which is
why the Serpent Cults are so against Protestant Christianity, especially in
America, and it is their full intention to annihilate all Christians along
with Patriots when and if their final National Socialist coup d'etat is a
success. The Scottish Rite of Masonry was itself created at the Jesuit
college of Clermont in France as a means for the 'wholey' Roman Empire to
infiltrate all of the religious, political, fraternal, economic, military,
media and educational establishments of the world and turn them in support
of the New World Order. Mazzini created the "International Working Man's
League" which was determined to consolidate all of the occult secret
societies of Europe under central control. Two of the most ardent
supporters of Mazzini and his "International" were Marx and Lenin. Lenin
was sent into Russia by the German government to stir up revolution. As for
Fascism, Edmond Paris in his SECRET HISTORY OF THE JESUITS reveals that
Adolph Hitler's S.S. organization was created by Nazi-Jesuits who made up
the inner core of Nazi Intelligence. As for the Islamic movement, former
Jesuit Alberto Rivera has revealed that he took part in secret Jesuit
briefings which described how Mohammed was 'groomed' by his Roman Catholic
wife and her Jesuit relatives and associates to be the leader of a new
religion. It is interesting that it is the Islamic Muslims, the Fascist
Croatians and the Communist United Nations which had targeted the Serbians
in the Balkans wars. What is not generally known is that during World War
II the Catholic Croatians joined with the "Ustachi", a Nazi-Jesuit killer
force, to exterminate hundreds of thousands of Yugosla- vian Serbian Greek
Orthodox AND Jewish men, woman and children in the most brutal manner one
can imagine. In other words, the Serbians feel that unless they in turn
exterminate the Croatians -- then the Croats may attempt to finish their
"ethnic cleansing" of the Serbians. The Croa- tians therefore "created" the
Serbian monster that in the mid '90's came back to haunt them with their
own version of "ethnic cleansing". The United States should stay out of the
picture entirely. The Croatians created the problem, so let them deal with
it. Could it be that the Com- munist UN - Islamic Muslim - Fascist Croation
alliance in Eastern Europe and their exterior allies will form the core of
the tri-continental "New World Order" that is apparently destined to bind
Asia, Africa and Europe together in an unholy alliance that will one day
invade the United States of America, according to George Washington's
vision? It is an interesting prospect to consider.]

CURRENCY CHANGE...GUN CONFISCATION:

A U.N. "observer" at a gun show in Florence, S.C., admitted that "...the
U.N. has been training with the CIA, FBI, ATF, and other law enforcement
agencies to confiscate guns in 1996 after the currency change." There
already have been announcements concerning the coming currency change.

Many witnesses have alleged that 'Black Helicopters' have been observed in
connection with Underground Base / New World Order activities as well as
other unusual occurrences. According to some investigators the same
NEO-FASCIST [Bavarian-Illuminati] Global Dictators who financed Adolph
Hitler are at it again, except this time the 'Third Reich' is being
replaced by the 'New World Order', complete with it's own United Nations -
backed Gestapo, Concentration Camps, S.S. type Police Forces, etc. If it
happened before in Europe, then could it happen again in America? If 'we'
as Americans don't cease from our preocupation with self-serving pursuits
and from our tendencies to mortgage our children's future for immediate and
fleeting physical gains, and if we don't begin to take the steps necessary
to preserve what little freedoms we do have, then perhaps we will deserve
what may come as a result. Did you know that Socialist elements within the
United Nations continually betrayed our military plans to Communist enemy
forces in the Korea and Vietnam conflicts? Do you wonder why those 'wars'
ended in stalemate or victory for the Communists? Did you know that
America's military forces and equipment are continually being surren- dered
to U.N. control? Did you know that the U.N. is training foreign military
troops on AMERICAN soil under the cover of joint military training, and
that one of the largest foreign forces who are training here with the
blessing of our blind and treasonous leaders are the Germans? Have you
heard the reports of military equipment with U.N. insignias being shuffled
around the States on trains or in convoys as if something big were in the
works, or of the mysterious reports of rail cars fitted with literally
MILLIONS of shackles which are being commissioned and built and paid for by
some mysterious source? Have you heard the reports of military personnel in
U.N. vans who have stopped people on lonely stretches of road on AMERICAN
soil, threatened them, con- ducted search and seizures, and confiscated
personal property in some cases?

are those who are con- vinced that WITH the Assassination of President John
F. Kennedy a partial 'coup d'etat' took place in America via
Internationalist groups who are determined to destroy the U.S.
Constitution, and that the 'presidents' who were manipulated into office
since that time -- mostly C.F.R. and T.L.C. members -- have signed numerous
un-constitutional 'executive orders' designed to pave the way for world
dictatorship. If this is the case, then Americans have the CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT to resist this FOREIGN U.N. - N.W.O. government, a right which is
also laid down in the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. As for the Kennedy
assassination itself and those behind it, Louisiana District Attorney James
Garrison in an interview with Playboy maga- zine made the following
statement in regards to Lee Harvey Oswald: "...Our office has positively
identified a number of his associates as neo-Nazis. Oswald would have been
more at home with Mein Kampf than Das Kapital." Ironically, the Mafia agent
who was assigned to kill the "patsy" Oswald, Jack Ruby, was one of these
neo-Nazis. - Wol.)

and can handle up to 100,000 people at a time (Ironically the Oklahoma City
bombing which was reportedly carried out by a secret CIA "committee of ten"
using two bombs -- the fertilizer bomb being more of a diver- sion -- had
inadvertently [?] broken through to a massive under- ground base or 'ground
scraper' under the Oklahoma City Federal Building. This facility is
reportedly 18 levels deep with the top five used as parking for base
workers. Immediately following the bombing a fire officer reported to a
local station that the blast had broken through to huge tunnels filled with
tanks, missiles, and all kinds of military equipment. Could this be one of
the over 120 underground "New World Order" bases which reportedly serve as
Trojan horses beneath America [including several Federal build- ings in
that they probably serve as defense shelters as well?], facilities which
will apparently be utilized once the UN - NWO takeover plan begins? It is
uncertain just 'who' the conspirators behind the bombing were working for,
as the tragedy had a cancel- ing-out effect. ALL 17+ ATF agents and most of
the CIA agents had failed to show up for work that day, and the tragedy was
immediately used to justify attacks against Constitutional militia
movements. On the other hand however the tragedy exposed THAT particular
site as being a possible NWO underground military com- mand center - Wol.)
"D) The Eastern processing center is not yet identified at this time.
