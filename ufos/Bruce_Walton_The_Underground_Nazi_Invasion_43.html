 [PART 43]

A Lecture By Phil Schneider: May 1995 =====================================

Phil Schneider, a very brave man, recently lost his life due to what
appeared to be a military-style execution in January 1996. He was found
dead in his apartment with piano wire still wrapped around his neck.
According to some sources, he had been brutally tortured repeated before
being killed. Phil Schneider was an ex-government engineer who was involved
in building underground bases, the government silenced him?!...

In May 1995, Phil Schneider did a lecture on what he had discovered. Seven
months later he was tortured and killed by those for whom he had previously
worked. This man's final acts should not go unnoticed.

"It is because of the horrendous structure of the federal government that I
feel directly imperiled *not* to tell anybody about this material. How long
I will be able to do this is anybody's guess. However, I would like to
mention that this talk is going to be broken up into four main topics. Each
of these topics will have some bearing on what you people are involved in,
whether you are patriots or not.

"I want you to know that these United States are a beautiful place. I have
gone to more than 70 countries, and I cannot remember any country that has
the beauty, as well as the magnificence of its people, like these United
States.

"To give you an overview of basically what I am, I started off and went
through engineering school. Half of my school was in that field, and I
built up a reputation for being a geological engineer, as well as a
structural engineer with both military and aerospace applications. I have
helped build two main bases in the United States that have some
significance as far as what is called the New World Order. The first base
is the one at Dulce, New Mexico. I was involved in 1979 in a firefight with
alien humanoids, and I was one of the survivors. I'm probably the only
talking survivor you will ever hear. Two other survivors are under close
guard. I am the only one left that knows the detailed files of the entire
operation. Sixty-six Secret Service agents, FBI, Black Berets and the like,
died in that firefight. I was there.

"Number one, part of what I am going to tell you is going to be very
shocking. Part of what I am going to tell you is probably going to be very
unbelievable, though, instead of putting your glasses on, I'm going to ask
you to put your "scepticals" on. But please, feel free to do your own
homework. I know the Freedom of Information Act isn't much to go on, but
it's the best we've got. The local law library is a good place to look for
Congressional Records. So, if one continues to do their homework, then one
can be standing vigilant in regard to their country.

::: Deep Underground Military Bases and the Black Budget :::

"I love the country I am living in more than I love my life, but I would
not be standing before you now, risking my life, if I did not believe it
was so. The first part of this talk is going to concern deep underground
military bases and the black budget. The Black Budget is a secretive budget
that garners 25% of the gross national product of the United States. The
Black Budget currently consumes $1.25 trillion per [every two] years. At
least this amount is used in black programs, like those concerned with deep
underground military bases. Pre- sently, there are 129 deep underground
military bases in the United States.

"They have been building these 129 bases day and night, unceasingly, since
the early 1940's. Some of them were built even earlier than that. These
bases are basically large cities underground connected by high-speed
magneto-leviton trains that have speeds up to Mach 2. Several books have
been written about this activity. Al Bielek has my only copy of one of
them. Richard Souder, a Ph.D architect, has risked his life by talking
about this. He worked with a number of government agencies on deep
underground military bases. In around where you live, in Idaho, there are
11 of them. (Note: There have been allegations claiming that, due to the
vast publicity that the 'Groom Lake' facility in Nevada has been recieving,
much of the antigravity, biogenetic and other 'Above Top Secret'
'underground projects' of the secret government have been transferred to
the underground facilities of Idaho, of Utah [Dougway, etc.] and some
'island' bases that the CIA has been using, mostly in the Pacific I would
guess. - Wol.)

"The average depth of these bases is over a mile, and they again are
basically whole cities underground. They all are between 2.66 and 4.25
cubic miles in size. They have laser drilling mach- ines that can drill a
tunnel seven miles long in one day. The Black Projects sidestep the
authority of Congress, which as we know is illegal. Right now, the New
World Order is depending on these bases. If I had known at the time I was
working on them that the NWO was involved, I would not have done it. I was
lied to rather extensively.

::: Development of Military Technology, Implied GERMAN Interest in
Hyperspacial Technology, and More :::

"Basically, as far as technology is concerned, for every calendar year that
transpires, military technology increases about 44.5 years. This is why it
is easy to understand that back in 1943 they were able to create, through
the use of vaccum tube tech- nology, a ship that could literally disappear
from one place and appear in another place. (Note: This was the Navy's
'Philadelphia Project' which was originally initiated to develop radar
invisibility to hide Navy ships from German Subs, using Einsteinian Unified
Field Physics applications and under the direction of Nikola Tesla. The
experiments, beginning in 1943, also reportedly produced visual
invisibility by creating an electromagnetic field around the boat which
'bent' the light rays around it, producing invisibility effects in that
visibility effects are the result of light bouncing off of a physical
object. The experiment also reportedly and inadver- tently[?] produced a
'warp' in time-space -- apparently not as difficult to produce as the 'Star
Trek' series would imply -- which transported the U.S.S. Eldridge to
another destination as a result of some type of EM teleportation effect...
this last claim being the most controversial aspect of the 'experiment'.
The Philadelphia technology was [according to various sources] carried on
in secret by the Navy and reportedly con- tinues to this day -- with much
of the top-secret technology having been incorporated into the STEALTH air
fleet. During the following 40 years or so from 1943 and onward, fascist
collaborators and later the CIA became involved in stealing the
'Philadelphia' technology and delivering it to 'Nazi' interests, who
developed their own 'Phoenix Project' which was in full-swing by 1983, with
several underground project bases involved, all of these being coordinated
by the major underground facility below the old Air Base at Montauk Point,
Long Island. The activity there reportedly continues to this day. The
Phoenix Projects were directed by Dr. John Von Neumann and were financed
via several million dollars in [stolen] Nazi gold and later by the German
Krupp family who built munitions plants for the Nazis and who have major
controlling interests in International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. --
I.T.T., the huge conglomerate which has been devouring other com- panies
for decades. A major I.T.T. headquarters in New Jersey, according to Al
Bielek who was involved with both the Philadelphia and Phoenix Projects,
connects to a major tunnel terminal below, one which leads to the New World
Order underground bases, or the 'Alternative 002' network. In collaboration
with the New Jersey based Brookhaven National Laboratories, the Phoenix
Project is alleged to have used several thousand young people as
'experimentees'. Many of these were homeless kids recruited off the strees
of major cities, and due to the CIA-NAZI influence behind the project these
were mostly blue-eyed and blond -- the 'Aryan' ideal. The Phoenix
Experiment combined sophisticated microwave mind-control experimentation
with electromagnetic 'warp tunnel' experiments, similar to the EM 'warp
field' that was created around the U.S.S. Eldridge in 1943. Several of the
young people were 'programmed' with mind-control indoctrination in order to
perform certain missions for the 'Nazis', and re-integrated back into
society. The controversial part of the Phoenix Projects however is that
others of these were sacrificed in 'warp tunnel' experi- ments, whatever
that might have entailed. According to Al Bielek, parts of the Phoenix
Projects were originally funded by allocated "National Defense" funds via
the CIA [the "double agency"], and when some Congressmen learned that mind
control research was involved, the Congressmen withdrew the funding --
although the projects continued through funding provided by Nazi gold, the
Krupp family and other illicit sources. There is apparently an ongoing
conflict between what we might consider the NAVY-backed 'Philadelphians'
who are intent on defending the Constitutional American national
government; and the NAZI-backed 'Phoenicians' who are intent on enforcing a
"New World Order" Bavarian world government. This conflict would be along
the same lines as the present 'Intelligence War' between the NAVY/COM12 and
NAZI/MJ12 [AQUARIUS] Intelligence agencies. - Wol.) "My father, Otto Oscar
Schneider, fought on both sides of the war. He was originally a U-boat
captain, and was captured and repatriated in the United States. He was
involved with different kinds of concerns, such as the A-bomb, the H-bomb
and the Philadelphia Experiment. He invented a high-speed camera that took
pictures of the first atomic [Hydrogen or H-Bomb] tests at Bikini Island on
July 12, 1946...

"Anyway, my father laid the groundwork with theoreticians about the
Philadelphia experiment, as well as other experiments. What does that have
to do with me? Nothing, other than the fact that he was my father. I don't
agree with what he did on the other side, but I think he had a lot of guts
in coming here. He was hated in Germany. There was a $1 million reward,
payable in gold, to any- one who killed him. Obviously, they didn't
succeed. Anyway, back to our topic -- deep underground bases.

::: The Fire Fight At Dulce Base :::

"Back in 1954, under the Eisenhower administration, the federal government
decided to circumvent the Constitution of the United States and form a
treaty with alien entities. It was called the 1954 Greada Treaty, which
basically made the agreement that the aliens involved could take a few cows
and test their implanting techniques on a few human beings, but that they
had to give details about the people involved. Slowly, the aliens altered
the bargain until they decided they wouldn't abide by it at all. Back in
1979, this was the reality, and the fire-fight at Dulce occurred quite by
accident. I was involved in building an ADDITION to the deep underground
military base at Dulce, which is probably the deepest base. It goes down
seven levels and over 2.5 miles deep. At that particular time, we had
drilled four distinct holes in the desert, and we were going to link them
together and blow out large sections at a time. My job was to go down the
holes and check the rock samples, and recommend the explosive to deal with
the particular rock. As I was headed down there, we found ourselves amidst
a large cavern that was full [of] aliens, otherwise known as large
[saurian] Greys. I shot two of them. At that time, there were 30 people
down there. About 40 more came down after this started, and all of them got
killed. We had surpised a whole underground base of existing aliens. Later,
we found out that they had been living on [under] our planet for a long
time...

"Anyway, I got shot in the chest with one of their weapons, which was a box
on their body, that blew a hole in me and gave me a nasty dose of cobalt
radiation. I have had cancer because of that.

"I didn't get really interested in [antigravity] technology until I started
work at Area 51, north of Las Vegas. After about two years recu- perating
after the 1979 incident, I went back to work for Morrison and Knudson, EG&G
and other companies. At Area 51, they were testing all kinds of peculiar
spacecraft. How many people here are familiar with Bob Lazar's story? He
was a physicist working at Area 51 trying to decipher the propulsion factor
in some of these craft. (Note: Robert Lazar first brought his story to
George Knapp, a Las Vegas TV director who produced a whole series on 'UFO'
phenomena and the strange activity out at Area 51. In fact, several people
who had supplied source information to Knapp later had their homes broken
into and documents stolen. One source was Stacy Borland, who was in contact
with contract workers out in Mercury, Nevada who claimed that some of their
fellow workers in the underground bases had been taken hostage and were
being held as prisoners underground because they had 'seen too much'.
Borland and her brother were later found dead in Borland's home as a result
of a gangland-type slaying. Since Lazar claimed that he had worked at Las
Alamos before being employed by EG&G to work at the Nevada base, Knapp
contacted Los Alamos Labs for confirmation. They denied that he had ever
worked there, and Lazar insisted that all records of him having worked at
Los Alamos were being erased because the secret government was in the
process of making him a "non-person" [or taking him out] because of his
choice to expose what was going on in the Nevada Military Complex. George
Knapp DID however discover an old Los Alamos phone directory with Lazar's
name in it, and an early Los Alamos publication with a photo of Bob Lazar
next to a race car -- racing being one of Lazar's side hobbies. Lazar
claims that the unusual vehicles he observed at the Groom Lake base were
captured by 'Alpha-Blue' crash-retrieval teams out of Wright Patterson AFB,
Ohio -- after they had crashed or had been shot from the sky by USAF jets
over remote areas. Others claim that the 'alien' story is merely a cover
for super advanced aerospace craft that are being developed at Area 51.
Lazar himself implies that some of the ships he saw appeared similar to
those that the Nazis had devoloped, some ships were apparently occupied by
other humans of unknown origin, while still others were piloted by the
short reptiloid 'Grays' -- although whether they were true aliens or cloned
biogenetic creations developed to withstand space travel, or both, has been
a matter of debate among vanguard 'Ufologists' for years. Nevertheless,
several tens of thousands of witnesses have reported run-ins or abductions
by these 'Grays'. The fact is that 'something' is going on at Area 51, and
it has something to do with covert space projects and 'aliens' -- whether
the aliens are from inside or outside of this planet, whether the 'aliens'
are in fact 'us' [Americans, Antarcticans, etc.]... or both. - Wol.)

::: Schneider's Worries About Government Factions, Railroad Cars and
Shackle Contracts :::

"Now, I am very worried about the activity of the the 'federal' government.
They have lied to the public, stonewalled senators, and have refused to
tell the truth in regard to alien matters. I can go on and on. I can tell
you that I am rather disgruntled. Recently, I knew someone who lived near
where I live in Port- land, Oregon. He worked at Gunderson Steel
Fabrication, where they make railroad cars. Now, I knew this fellow for the
better part of 30 years, and he was kind of a quiet type. He came in to see
me one day, excited, and he told me "they're building prisoner cars." He
was nervous. Gunderson, he said, had a contract with the federal government
to build 107,200 full length railroad cars, each with 143 pairs of
shackles. There are 11 sub-contractors in this giant project. Supposedly,
Gunderson got over 2 billion dollars for the contract. Bethlehem Steel and
other steel outfits are involved. He showed me one of the cars in the rail
yards in North Portland. He was right. If you multiply 107,200 times 143
times 11, you come up with about 15,000,000. This is probably the number of
people [activists] who disagree with the federal government. No more can
you vote any of these people out of office. Our present structure of
government is "tech- nocracy", not democracy, and it is a form of
feudalism. It has nothing to do with the republic of the United States.
These people are god-less, and have legislated out prayer in public
schools. You can get fined up to $100,000 and two years in prison for
praying in school. I believe we can do better. I also believe that the
federal government is running the gambit of enslaving the people of the
United States. I am not a very good speaker, but I'll keep shooting my
mouth off until somebody puts a bullet in me, because it's worth it to talk
to a group like this about these atrocities.

::: America's Black Program Contractors :::

"There are other problems. I have some interesting 1993 figures. There are
29 prototype stealth aircraft presently. The budget from the U.S. Congress
five-year plan for these is $245.6 million. You couldn't buy the spare
parts for these black programs for that amount. So, we've been lied to. The
black budget is roughly $1.3 trillion every two years. A trillion is a
thousand billion. A trillion dollars weighs 11 tons. The U.S. Congress
never sees the books involved with this clandestine pot of gold.
Contractors of sleath programs: EG&G, Westinghouse, McDonnell Douglas, Mor-
rison- Knudson, Wackenhut Security Systems, Boeing Aerospace, Lorimar
Aerospace, Aerospacial in France, Mitsibishi Industries, Rider Trucks,
Bechtel, *I.G. Farben*, plus a host of hundreds more. Is this what we are
supposed to be living up to as freedom- loving people? I don't believe so.
(Note: As Schneider states, we should not preoccupy ourselves with only the
outward 'political' powers who are battling it out for dominance in this
fast-changing world. The real battleground and the real basis of power is
in the economic realm. As one 'insider' once stated: "Give me control of a
country's gold, and I don't care who controls the government." The Nazi's
realized this fact with their awareness that their 'successes' during World
War II were dependent on the Rockefellers, et all. This is why they made
major efforts to become economically self-dependent during the War. This is
also why following the war the NAZI's not only began to infiltrate the
Intelligence community [CIA], but also the Communications Industry [ITT],
the Petroleum Industry [ARCO] and the Military-Industrial Com- plex
[WACKENHUT, et al.]. This is also why Bavaria has pushed to establish the
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY with the major controlling system being the
international banking network which is ultimately controlled by the
'Bavarian Empire', you might say. This EEC project has been successful for
them in that the economic control is now begun to trickle down into the
political realm, and those European sovereignties which originally desired
only economic interaction are finding their political sovereignties slowly
being eroded away by an expanding 'New World Order'. The Nazi's/Bavarians
failed to conquer Europe by force during World War II, so now it appears
that they are accomplishing the same thing through stealth. - Wol.)

::: Star Wars and Apparent Alien Threat :::

"Still, 68% of the military budget is directly or indirectly affected by
the black budget. Star Wars relies heavily upon stealth wea- ponry. By the
way, none of the stealth program would have been available if we had not
taken apart crashed alien disks. None of it. Some of you might ask what the
"space shuttle" is "shuttling". Large ingots of special metals that are
milled in space and cannot be produced on the surface of the earth. They
need the near vaccum of outer space to produce them. We are not even being
told anything close to the truth. I believe our gov- ernment officials have
sold us down the drain -- lock, stock and barrel. Up until several weeks
ago, I was employed by the U.S. government with a Ryolite-38 clearance
factor -- one of the highest in the world. I believe the Star Wars program
is there solely to act as a buffer to prevent alien attack -- it has
nothing to do with the "cold war", which was only a toy [a charade] to
garner money from all the people -- for what? The whole lie was planned and
executed for the last 75 years.

::: Stealth Aircraft Technology Use by U.S. Agencies and the United Nations
:::

"Here's another piece of information for you folks. The Drug Enforcement
Administration and the ATF rely on stealth tactical weaponry for as much as
40% of their operations budget. This in 1993, and the figures have gone up
considerably since. The United Nations used American stealth aircraft for
over 28% of its collective worldwide operations from 1990 to 1992,
according to the Center for Strategic Studies and UN Report 3092.

::: The Guardians of Stealth and Delta Force Origins of the Bosnia Conflict
:::

"The Guardians of Stealth: There are at least three distinct
classifications of police that guard our most well-kept secrets. Number
one, the Military Joint Tactical Force (MJTF), some- times called the Delta
Force or Black Berets, is a multi-national tactical force primarily used to
guard the various stealth aircraft worldwide. By the way, there were 172
stealth aircraft built. Ten crashed, so there were at last count about 162.
Bill Clinton signed them away about six weeks ago TO THE UNITED NATIONS.
There have been indications that the Delta Force was sent over to Bosnia
during the last days of the Bush administration as a covert sniper force,
and that they started taking pot shots at each side of the controversy, in
order to actually START the Bosnia conflict that would be used by
succeeding administrations for political purposes.

::: Thoughts on the Bombings in the United States :::

"I was hired not too long ago to do a report on the World Trade Center
bombing. I was hired because I know about the 90 some- odd varieties of
chemical explosives. I looked at the pictures taken right after the blast.
The concrete was puddled and melted. The steel and the rebar was literally
extruded up to six feet longer than its original length. There is only one
weapon that can do that -- a small nuclear weapon. That's a
construction-type nuclear device. Obviously, when they say that it was a
nitrate explosive that did the damage, they're lying 100%, folks. The
people they have in custody probably didn't do the crime. As a matter of
fact, I have reason to believe that the same group held in custody did do
other crimes, such as killing a Jewish rabbi in New York. How- ever, I want
to further mention that with the last explosion in Okla- homa City, they
are saying that it was a nitrate or fertilizer bomb that did it. "First,
they came out and said it was a 1,000 pound fertilizer bomb. Then, it was
1,500. Then 2,000 pounds. Now its 20,000. You can't put 20,000 pounds of
fertilizer in a Rider Truck. Now, I've never mixed explosives, per se. I
know the chemical struc- ture and the application of construction
explosives. My reputation was based on it. I helped hollow out more than 13
deep under- ground military bases in the United States. I worked on the
Malta project, in West Germany, in Spain and in Italy. (Al Bielek speaks of
an underground 'MALTA' base below or near the Alsace-Lorraine Mts. of SW
Germany to where much of the 'Phoenix Project' was transferred from Montauk
Point, Long Island. Could this be the same 'Malta' project that Al
Schneider speaks of? - Wol). I can tell you from experience that a nitrate
explosion would not have hardly shattered the windows of the federal
building in Oklahoma City. It would have killed a few people and knocked
part of the facing off the building, but it would have never have done that
kind of damage. I believe I have been lied to, and I am not taking it any
longer, so I'm telling you that you've been lied to.

::: The Truth Behind the Republican Contract With America :::

"I don't perceive at this time that we have too much more than six months
of life left in this country, at the present rate. We are the laughing
stock of the world, because we are being hood- winked by so many evil
people that are running this country. I think we can do better. I think the
people over 45 are seriously worried about their future. I'm going to run
some scary scenarios by you. The Contract With America. It contains the
same term- inology that Adolph Hitler used to subvert Germany in 1931. I
believe we can do better. The Contract With America (or is it the "Contract
ON America"? - Wol.) is a last ditch effort by 'our 'federal government' to
tear away the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

::: Some Statistics on the Black Helicopter Presence :::

"The black helicopters. There are over 64,000 black helicopters in the
United States. For every hour that goes by, there is one being built. Is
this the proper use of our money? What does the federal government need
64,000 tactical helicopters for, if they are not trying to enslave us. I
doubt if the entire military needs 64,000 worldwide. I doubt if all the
world needs that many. There are 157 F-117A stealth aircraft loaded with
LIDAR and computer-enhanced imaging radar. They can see you walking from
room to room when they fly over your house. (One source insisted that they
saw a Stealth aircraft 'hovering' over the Mon- tauk base, so I would guess
that they could also 'hover' over a house if in fact they are integrated
with antigravity drives. - Wol) They see objects in the house from the air
with a variation limit of 1 inch to 30,000 miles. That's how accurate that
is. Now, I worked in the federal government for a long time, and I know
exactly how they handle their business.

::: Government Earthquake Device, AIDS as a Bioweapon Based on Alien
Excretions :::

"The federal government has now invented an earthquake device. I am a
geologist, and I know what I am talking about. With the Kobe earthquake in
Japan, there was no pulsewave as in a normal earthquake. None. In 1989,
there was an earthquake in San Francisco. There was no pulse wave with that
one either. It is a Tesla device that is being used for evil purposes. The
black budget programs have subverted science as we know it [they have
harnessed the 'dark side' of technology and kept the beneficial technology
from the masses. - Wol.]. Look at AIDs, invented by the National Ordinance
Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois in 1972. It was a biological weapon to be
used against the people of the United States. The reason I know this is
that I have seen the documenta- tion by the Office of Strategic Services,
which by the way is still in operation to this day, through the CDC in
Atlanta. They used the glandular excretions of animals, humans and alien
humanoids to create the virus. These alien humanoids the government is hob-
nobbing with are the worst news. There is absolutely no defense against
their germs -- none. They are a biological weapon of terrible consequence.
Every alien on the planet needs to be isolated. (Note: This may or may not
be science fiction, but according to John Lear, the reptiloid 'aliens' of
ancient saurian extraction and mutation who long ago disappeared under the
surface of the planet, are collaborating with Bavarian agents deep within
the 'Dulce' base. This collaboration was re-established even after two
years of non interaction, because these 'Nazi's' NEED the alien technology
to carry out their plans for an electronic world dictatorship, and visa
versa the aliens NEED the help of the Bavarian Illuminati and their
collaborators to carry out their own agendas... a 'marriage of con-
venience'. One of the more disturbing claims that John Lear has made,
putting his reputation on the line in the process, is that the 'aliens'
subsist on a 'protein formula' that consists of vital fluids, secretions
and enzymes extracted from animals and humans who are abducted and
mutilated for the purpose. Since the reptiloid 'Grays' have atrophied
digestive tracts, they cannot injest through the mouth, so they use the
'formula' -- which is mixed with hydrogen peroxide to kill germs and
viruses -- by dipping their arms in large vats of the blue-greenish viscous
fluid and rubbing it over their bodies where it is absorbed through the
skin, and later excreted and urinated out from the pores causing an extreme
acrid and amonia-like stench from the perspective of those who happen to be
around them at the time. As for the larger more 'crocodillian' appearing
hominoids that serve as masters over the 'Grays', these apparently injest
'food' via a more conventional manner as is the case with most all other
'reptiles'. As I've said before, this could have some basis of truth OR it
could be part of an elaborate misinformation scenario designed to divert
attention from military-industrial antigravity craft and bio- genetic
life-forms which are being bred in secret within the under- ground bases...
or both. - Wol.)

"Saddam Hussein killed 3.5 million Kurdish people with a similar biological
weapon. Do we, the people of this planet, deserve this? No, we don't, but
we are not doing anything about it. Every moment we waste, we are doing
other people on the planet a disservice. Right now, I am dying of cancer
that I contracted because of my work for the federal government. I might
live six months. I might not. I will tell you one thing. If I keep speaking
out like I am, maybe God will give me the life to talk my head off. I will
break every law that it takes to talk my head off. ELEVEN of my best
friends in the last 22 years have been MURDERED. Eight of the murders were
called "suicides." Before I went to talk in Las Vegas, I drove a friend
down to Joshua Tree, near 29 Palms. I drove into the mountains in order to
get to Needles, California, and I was followed by two government E-350 vans
with G-14 plates, each with a couple of occupants, one of which had an Uzi.
I knew exactly who they were. I have spoken 19 times and have probably
reached 45,000 people. Well, I got ahead of them and came to a stop in the
middle of the road. They both went on either side of me and down a ravine.
Is this what its going to take? I cut up my security card and sent it back
to the government, and told them if I was threatened, and I have been, that
I was going to upload 140,000 pages of documenta- tion to the internet
about (secret) government structure and the whole plan. I have already
begun that task.
