The Serpent Beings or the Nagas are said to possess many different kinds of
machines including aerial craft. According to 'Sharula' (or Bonnie), the
Aghartian Federation of humans utilizes their own space fleet (known as the
'Silver Fleet'); they assisted in the construction of Telos itself -- or
rather the extension of the underground metropolis from the already
existing natural caverns below Mt. Shasta; and are allegedly allied to at
least 100 human- occupied underground cities throughout the world, many of
them in conflict with the reptilian 'Draco' species and their 'Gray'
collaborators.

Sherman A. Minton Jr., a respected Reptilian and Amphibian biologist, in
his book 'VENOMOUS REPTILES' (Charles Ceaibrer Sons, N.Y. 1969) quotes from
some ancient Hindu legends describing the Nagas or the serpent race. These
legends state that this demon-race has the ability to inflict almost
instantaneous death upon a person through utilizing a cosmic 'fire' force
(possibly electromagnetic energy). Minton also states the fact that the
ancestors of modern-day 'snakes' once possessed limbs which became
atrophied through non-use over the ages; that there are lizards with
elongated snake-like bodies, a type of 'missing-link' between the
saurians-lizards-and-snakes; and that nearly all reptiles with "well
developed" limbs live underground! He also refers to legends which state
that some Nagas were present at the birth of Guatama Siddharta (Buddha),
and others which allege that a major book on YOGA was channeled at a 'well'
which is believed to be an entrance to the underworld of the Naga's,
located in Benares, India.

NOT ALL subterran societies are of the insidious, reptilian or
reptilian-controlled variety, as further evidence of this we add the
following revelations from 'Commander X', the mysterious anonymous U.S.
Intelligence official who has revealed much about 'inside' government
knowledge of alien civilization both beyond and beneath the earth. He is
the author of the book 'UNDERGROUND ALIEN BASES', published by Tim
Beckley's UFO REVIEW/Abelard Press, N.Y. Mr. 'X' was apparently very
familiar with the Subterranean-world controversies that surrounded early
issues of AMAZING STORIES magazine (circa 1940-1945) and 'related'
publications in the early years when the science of Ufology was first
beginning to emerge. This may explain his present position in U.S.
Intelligence, and the sensitive knowledge that he has access to. He reveals
the following paraspeleological events which reportedly took place in South
America:

"..Of all the countries on the face of the Earth, none is more mysterious,
or less explored, than is Brazil. Miles upon miles of this country have
never been set foot upon by white man. In these areas live whole tribes of
savage Indians whose civilizations are said to be akin to those existing at
the time of the Stone Age. Many of those who have dared venturing into
these pockets of unexplored jungle have never come out. Perhaps the case of
Colonel Fawcett will be familiar to readers as an example of what I mean.
He supposedly was captured by a tribe of wild Indians while in search of a
'hidden city' said to be located in the confines of the dense jungle...

"Before his death, Dr. (Raymond) Bernard had sent this writer many personal
letters regarding his findings related to...under- ground civilization(s).
We quote from these communications in the following:

     "'I arrived in Brazil in 1956 and have been carrying on my
     research since I met a Theosophical leader who told me about the
     subterranean cities...that exist in Brazil. He referred to
     Professor Henrique de Souza, president of the Brazilian
     Theosophical Society, at Sao Lourenco in the state of Minas
     Gerais, who erected a temple dedicated to Agharta, which is the
     Buddhist name of the subterranean World. Here in Brazil live
     Theosophists from all parts of the world, all of whom believe in
     the existence of the subterranean cities.

     "'Professor de Souza told me that the great English explorer
     Colonel Fawcett is still alive, living in a subterranean city in
     the Roncador Mountains of Matto Grosso, where he found the
     subterranean city of Atlanteans for which he searched, but is
     held prisoner lest he reveal the secret of his whereabouts (Note:
     Bernard refers to the inhabitants of this city as 'Atlanteans',
     when in fact other accounts suggest that -- like the underground
     cities below the east coast of North America -- many of these
     cavern cities were originally CONSTRUCTED by an ancient
     antediluvian race. This race might have been very similar or even
     akin to the lost race spoken of in the 'Atlantis' legendary,
     whose abandoned caverns were later re-inhabited after the flood.
     In 'this' sense the inhabitants might be referred to as
     'Atlanteans', although the present dwellers of such underground
     communities probably do not have any direct 'genetic' ties to the
     antediluvian 'Atlanteans'. - Branton).

     "'He (Col. Fawcett) was not killed by Indians as is commonly
     believed. Professor de Souza claimed he has visited subterranean
     cities, including Shamballah, the world capital of the
     subterranean empire of Agharta. I then went to Matto Grosso to
     find the subterranean city where Fawcett is claimed to be living
     with his son Jack, but failed to do so. I then returned to
     Joinville in the state of Santa Catarina, and there continued my
     research.

     "'Just recently two explorers returned from entering a tunnel
     near Ponte Grosse in the state of Parana. One of them had
     recently entered alone and spent five days in the underworld city
     there. It had about 50 inhabitants plus children. The fruit
     orchards were recently planted, and the inhabitants received
     fruit from another subterranean city. During the last visit, the
     two explorers were met at the entrance of the tunnel by a
     guardian and the chief of the city, who told them that they
     should return in two years when the fruit trees will start to
     bear, but cannot enter now.

     "'The same two explorers entered a tunnel in Rincon, state of
     Parana, and finally came to a chimney-like structure with four
     chains hanging down. They descended on the chains but when they
     came near the bottom a gas with a chemical odor started to come
     up and forced them to ascend. Obviously the subterranean dwellers
     tried to keep them from reaching the city (This seems often to be
     the case - Commander X).

     "'Our explorer J.D. (name on file - Commander X), who is a
     mountain guide of the Mystery Mountain near Joinville (where
     there is supposed to be an entrance), said that several times he
     saw a luminous flying saucer ascend from the tunnel opening that
     leads to a subterranean city inside the mountain, in which he
     heard the beautiful choral singing of men and women, and also
     heard the 'canto galo' (rooster crowing), a universal symbol
     indicating the existence of subterranean cities in Brazil. He
     said that the saucer was so luminous that it lit up the night sky
     and converted it into daylight. On one occasion he met a group of
     subterranean men outside the tunnel. They were short, stocky,
     with reddish beards and long hair, and very muscular. When he
     tried to approach them, they vanished. Often he saw strange
     illuminations in this area at night which were probably produced
     by flying saucers (We use the name 'Mystery Mountain,' rather
     than reveal the true name of the mountain, so that unwanted
     outsiders will not come here to locate it). Throughout my many
     years of research I have accumulated a vast amount of data which
     would indicate that these entrances to subterranean cities abound
     throughout the region.

     "'An elderly man living in Joinville once told me that he had
     visited a tunnel near Concepiao in the state of Sao Paulo, and
     saw in the distance a marvelous subterranean city with vehicles
     darting back and forth, evidently traveling through tunnels from
     one subterranean city to another.

     "'Although the following report requires confirmation, it was
     told to me by an explorer named N.C. who said that he had visited
     a tunnel near Rio Casdor and had met a beautiful young woman
     appearing to be about 20 years of age. She spoke to him in
     Portuguese and SAID that she was 2,500 years old. He also met a
     bearded subterranean man.

     (Note: Often humans encountered in aerial disks or subterranean
     caverns declare that they possess remarkable longevity when
     compared with the longevity of surface humans. On the outset this
     might sound next to impossible, unless a revolutionary scientific
     breakthrough on the part of these human 'aliens' has allowed them
     to retard the aging process to an extreme degree. Or, could the
     possibly that they are separated from the degenerating
     radioactive contamination and solar rays prevalent on the surface
     explain their greater alleged longevity? Another possibility
     would be that through bionics or biological transplants and
     prosthetics, etc., the lifespan of human beings [possessing
     advanced biological and technological sciences] might
     theoretically be dramatically increased. Incidentally, the writer
     and traveler Robert Stacy-Judd described in some of his books an
     exploration he and others had made of the peripheral areas of the
     Loltun cave system of Yucatan. Legend says that at least one
     group of people, fleeing persecution, entered en masse into the
     massive Loltun caves and were never seen again. Stacy- Judd tells
     of his own encounter with a 'cave hermit' deep in the cavern
     chambers who claimed to be well over 1000 years old. This unusual
     man said that he was a guardian of the cave and of the ancient
     treasures -- and city? -- which lay deep below in the unknown
     depths, 'unknown' that is, except to the strange 'hermit'. This
     unusual man had emerged from the inner DEPTHS of the cave when
     they first encountered him. Aside from photographs of this
     'hermit' which appeared in some of his works, the author also
     revealed photographs of 'underground gardens' consisting of areas
     of the cave which contain small patches of 'jungle', small cave
     oasis' watered and lit through parts of the cavern ceilings which
     had collapsed in ages past, exposing them to the elements of the
     outer world above. Whether such claims of longevity are real or
     whether the "subterranean" people were just playing with the
     minds of such explorers who encountered them, is uncertain -
     Branton).

     "'Still another explorer named D.O. visited this SAME tunnel near
     Gaspar, Santa Catarina, and behind a wonderful fruit orchard saw
     a subterranean woman with a child in her arms reading to it aloud
     from a huge book written in an unknown language... After she read
     each sentence the child repeated the same and in this way was
     taught how to read. All of these subterranean cities are
     illuminated by strange light...'"

Raymond Bernard (whose actual name was 'Walter Seigmeister'), writing in
the Oct. 1959 issue of SEARCH Magazine, p. 48, described yet another
alleged encounter with a subterranean race. What are we to make of all
these stories? Are we to assume that some of the individuals who told
Bernard such accounts actually made them up, as some suggest, in order to
receive the financial bonus or reward that Bernard was sometimes known to
offer on documentable accounts of ancient tunnels? Or, are we to accept
these accounts for just what their sources claimed them to be, reports of
actual encounters with a subterranean world? Bernard stated the following:

     "...Last week my investigators returned and said they visited
     their city (i.e. the 'city' of a race of dwarf-humans whom
     Bernard referred to as the 'Niebelungs', who live in a
     subterranean region with it's own system of illumination -
     Branton) and are able to bring any of my American friends to
     visit it, but I require one condition: absolute secrecy, as I
     don't want governments to send armies into the tunnel to disturb
     these peaceful people.

     "To reach them requires a 3-day journey of about 40 miles through
     a tunnel. This entire distance is through a tunnel carefully
     lined with cut stone blocks below, above and on the sides. That
     was quite an engineering feat. I think the tunnel was made long
     to keep out curiosity seekers, and only the most determined will
     travel that distance.

     "Here is the report of my investigations: (They are two ranchers,
     father and son, who discovered the tunnel accidentally):

     "'We left our house 5 A.M. for the tunnel on top of a mountain
     and reached it 3 P.M. We were tired and camped near the entrance
     of the tunnel. For three days we proceeded through the tunnel. We
     told time by our watches, as we could not tell when it was day or
     night. We went to sleep at 10 P.M. and awoke at 3 A.M. and
     continued walking. By the third day the tunnel started to go
     downward by steps (Note: If the entrance was on 'top' of a
     mountain, we must assume that it sloped downward until it became
     too steep to continue without a stairway - Branton). It was built
     of stone blocks on all sides. By the night of the third day the
     tunnel suddenly opened into a great space covered with what
     appeared as a sky with a yellow light that made everything
     luminous, like daylight. We saw a city with many houses and saw
     many people in the distance. They were dwarfs with long white
     beards and long hair and we saw women and children, and heard
     them crying. The third member of our party got frightened so we
     had to return.'

     "These men found three such tunnels. They entered another for
     three days, but after hearing voices further in, got scared and
     returned. Now they are entering the third..."

Previously, we have referred to the alleged inhabitants of a subterranean
colony below Mt. Shasta in northern California, which is believed to be one
of the largest, if not THE largest, subterranean community in North
America, and which allegedly has ties with the Asian empire of 'Agharti'
and several South American subterranean colonies, and possibly also the
'Havmu- suvs' of the Mojave and Death Valley region. The following are some
excepts from an article written by William F. Hamilton (whose other
publications can at this writing be obtained via 7327 Bothwell Rd., Reseda,
CA 91335), who we have referred to in earlier writings. Bill Hamilton has
been in Data Processing for 22 years and is now a Sr. Programmer-Analyst.
He is a writer, investigator and researcher. He has been involved in UFO
research and investigations since 1953. Bill is a past member of The
Foundation for Research in Parapsychology, The Spacecraft Research
Foundation, The World Federation of Science and Engineering, and MENSA, the
high IQ society. He has been a member of Daniel Fry's Understanding, Inc.,
and served on it's Board. He founded NEXUS and NEXUS NEWS, an info center
for alternative energy and alternative life-styles. He also founded UFORUM,
a monthly forum on the UFO phenomena. He is a UFO investigator with MUFON,
an Associate Director of UFOCCI, and founder of UFORCES. Bill is the author
of the following books: SPACE, TIME AND GRAVITY; CENTER OF THE VORTEX;
TELOS, THE COSMIC COMPUTER; GEOMETRY OF THE GRID; CLOSE ENCOUNTER REPORT;
ALIEN MAGIC; and COSMIC TOP SECRET. He has written numerous articles for
publications such as 'Search,' 'Energy Unlimited,' 'New Age Science,' 'The
New Atlantean Journal,' 'California UFO,' and 'UFO Universe'. The following
article originally appeared in the 'New Atlantean Journal':

"...I run across some fascinating people in the course of my investigations
who tell me many unusual stories. While on the trail of reports of UFO base
locations, I met a young, very pretty blonde girl with almond-shaped eyes
and small perfect teeth, whose name is Bonnie. Bonnie has told me an
incredible story and has related a volume of interesting information...
Bonnie is sincere, cheerful, and rational and says she (was born) in 1951
in a city called TELOS that was built inside an artificial dome-shaped
cavern in the Earth a mile or so beneath Mt. Shasta, California.

"Bonnie, her mother (Rana Mu), her father Ra(Mu), her sister Judy, her
cousins Lorae and Matox, live and move in our society, returning frequently
to TELOS for rest and recuperation. Bonnie relates that her people use
boring machines to bore tunnels in the Earth. These boring machines heat
the rock to incandescence, then vitrify it, thus eliminating the need for
beams and supports. A tube transit tunnel is used to connect the
(underground) cities that exist in various subterranean regions in our
hemisphere. The tube trains are propelled by electromagnetic impulses up to
speeds of 2500 mph. One tube connects with one of their cities in the Matto
Grosso jungle of Brazil. (They) have developed space travel and some flying
saucers come from their subterranean bases...

"They grow food hydroponically under full-spectrum lights with their
gardens attended by automatons. The food and resources of Telos are
distributed in plenty to the million-and-a-half population that thrives on
a no-money economy. Bonnie talks about history, of the Uighers, Naga-Mayas,
and Quetzals, of which she is a descendant (Note: Many people have
mistakenly identified the inhabitants of 'Telos' as being directly
descended from the 'Lemurians', however Bonnie here seems to refute this by
indicating that her ancestrage was other than this, possibly Meso-American
and/or East-Indian? As in the case of the ancient 'antediluvian' cities of
the eastern seaboard which were re-established after being abandoned by the
lost 'Atlanteans'; the 'Lemurians', if they existed thousands of years ago,
also seem to have been devastated in a world-wide cataclysm -- and their
cities re- established by the Uighers, Naga-Mayas, and Quetzals as well as
scattered members of other societies. The antediluvian Atlanteans
apparently built underground systems below the eastern seaboard of North
and South America, whereas the MU- rians apparently had control of the
underground systems beneath the western seaboard. Although some
island-continents may have sunk following the deluge, most accounts
describe the 'Atlanteans', etc., as being antediluvians. Being that the
name 'Telos' is a Grecian word meaning 'uttermost, purpose', there is a
suggestion of a 'possible' connection with the Grecian-like Hav-musuvs of
the Panamint mountains of California - Branton).

"I met Bonnie's cousin, Matox, who, like her, is a strict vegetarian and
holds the same attitudes concerning the motives of government. They
constantly guard against discovery or intrusion. Their advanced awareness
and technology helps them remain vigilant...

"Science Fiction? Bonnie is a real person. Many have met her. Is she
perpetrating a hoax? For what motive? She does not seek publicity and I
have a devil of a time getting her to meetings to talk with others, but she
has done so. There has been little variation in her story and her answers
in the past three years. She has given me excellent technical insight on
the construction of a crystal- powered generator that extracts ambient
energy... Bonnie's father, the Ra-Mu, is 300 years old and a member of the
ruling council of Telos.

"Many tunnels are unsafe and closed off. All tube transit tunnels are
protected and are designed to eject uninvited guests. Does Bonnie have the
answers that we are looking for? I don't know... Bonnie says she would like
to satisfy our need for proof and will work with me on a satisfactory
answer to that problem, but she is unconcerned with whether people accept
her or not. Bonnie is humorous and easy-going and well-poised, yet
sometimes she becomes brooding and mysterious. She says her people are busy
planning survival centers for refugees. One of these is to be near
Prescott, Arizona..." (or, more exactly, below the Groom Creek area just
south of Prescott, to be exact. Another 'survival center' for refugees of
the world-wide cataclysms which the Telosians are convinced will devastate
the surface of the earth in future years, is said to be below the general
area of Jenny Lake, Wyoming, near the Tetons. The Tetons themselves have
been the alleged home of a mysterious race, according to different sources,
and extremely ancient stone 'buildings' or constructions have reportedly
been seen high atop the treacherous spurs of the Teton mountain range -
Branton).

When Bill Hamilton asked 'Bonnie' to elaborate about the power-sources
which her people utilize to propel the so-called "flying saucer" craft, she
replied:

     "...A lot of it is crystals (i.e. crystal-induced
     electromagnetism? - Branton), particularly the atmospheric
     vehicles. The planet-to- planet vehicles are driven by an
     Ion-Mercury engine. Spaceships can reach speeds way beyond light.
     They can enter hyperspace -- you generate into the fourth
     dimension -- this is controlled by an on-board computer that
     takes you into and out of hyperspace. I know this is a
     simplification. When your on a ship going into hyperspace, you
     will hear this vibration, and a loud screaming sound when you
     enter, then you will hear nothing..."

Bill concludes: "I have had many correlation's on this data and am
researching it further toward a comprehensive theory of space travel..."

Researcher Val Valerian refers to an incident which took place in 1988.
This incident indicated that at that time Project Bluebook was still as
active as ever. Valerian refers to a Sgt. Robert Williams (pseudonym for
his protection) who was stationed in Honolulu from 1971-1973. 'Williams'
was a photographer who worked for the Aerospace Audio Visual Service (AAVS)
which is headquartered at Norton AFB, CA.

In 1971 Williams was approached by PROJECT BLUEBOOK to work as a
photographer, which he did until 1973. On July 10, 1973 Williams was given
TDY orders and a Top Secret clearance, and was sent to Norton AFB and was
briefed into a secret project involving the photographing of alien beings
and craft. He was to work with a Ron Smith (also pseudonym). They were
blindfolded and put into a limousine with blacked-out windows and were
driven to their destination. Both felt the car descend and found themselves
in an underground base. Williams noted the time on his watch, and that 45
minutes had passed since the beginning of their journey.

Both were briefed and led to a laboratory, where they found two 'aliens' in
the process of being autopsied. Another alien was still alive, held
elsewhere. The creatures were wearing blue uniforms, and they noticed six
scientists and two MARINE guards. It was later determined that they had
been taken to the 29 Palms Marine Base in S. California.

They commenced to photograph the aliens. The bodies were black with green
fluid/blood. During the time when Williams was photographing the live alien
it terminated and at its death he felt 'something passing through him'. The
scientists there, he noticed, had bland expressions on their faces 'like
they weren't all there.' He was allowed to enter the disk which appeared
outwardly to be a 35' diameter disk, although inside it was almost as large
as a football field, indicating some type of space-warping technology.
After this, they were driven back to Norton AFB and then returned to
Honolulu. The men noticed that no one would speak to them, even their
wives. 'Smith' later disappeared and was never heard from again by
Williams, who (as of the early 1990's) now works in Nevada.

Valerian stated that records show a disk did crash in NW Arizona and was
recovered on July 10, 1973, the same day that Williams' and Smiths' Top
Secret orders came through.

Aside from this, 'Williams' stated that since the age of 3 he had
experienced 'abductions' by human-like beings, during which he was often
taken to a place with large white building that were LARGER WITHIN THAN
THEY WERE ON THE OUTSIDE, each containing 600 family units. During these
episodes he was befriended by a human girl close to his age named Karin,
and this friendship lasted to later years. Through hypnotic regression,
Williams recalled that during the drive to 29 Palms they (car and all?)
were transported onto a starship, where he met the ships captain -- none
other than Karin herself. They were later dropped off just outside of 29
Palms and the memory of the episode was removed.

Actually, several contactees say that it is not so much a removal of
"memory" as it is a transition into an altered state of consciousness and
an alternate personality which has been conditioned to relate to the
aliens, whether humans or grays. Since an alternate personality [psychosis]
is involved and not the 'conscious' mind, the conscious mind itself has no
memory of the events. Williams also stated that Karin's people have
developed time travel (Note: There are various accounts suggesting that it
is possible to travel through time without violating the laws of paradox.
In short, one cannot change the past, simply because the past has already
been changed -- or rather SET through the intervention of past, present and
future influences. It is suggested that the earth is in a universal
causality loop and that there was a point where "time" began on earth or in
the universe and there is a point when time will end, is ending or has
ended -- depending on ones perspective. This is not to say that everything
is SET, because it is not. We have the power to ESTABLISH our collective
reality by choices we make in the NOW, whether that NOW exists in the past,
the present or the future. In a way that is difficult for finite minds to
understand, events of the past help to set the present and future, events
of the present help to set the past and future, and events of the future
help to set the past and the present. So in reality, one cannot 'change'
the past, present or future, but they can take part in establishing it.
According to individuals involved with the Philadelphia and Montauk
projects, a human soul is attached to the universal causality sphere or the
"time" sequence at the point of conception -- not birth. They are attached
to the time sequence by what Nikola Tesla called a "zero-time reference"
that is integrated into the human soul itself. Upon the point of physical
death, the soul leaves the timeline and enters what we faintly perceive as
"eternity").

In relation to Williams' experiences, and his descriptions of advanced
civilizations, UFO's and 29 Palms, Valerian states:

     "...Investigations of the 29 Palms underground base during April
     1989 tracked down some data about the geology of the spot. During
     the time when the area was under the sea, an earthquake caused a
     large hole in the ground, causing a lot of water to create a
     funnel-like structure in the ground. Evidently, disks go in and
     out of there all the time, and the Army has tried to send cameras
     down there, only to have the cables cut. One group that attempted
     to go down on ropes were exposed to a blue gas and had to be
     pulled out again..."

We quote now from parts of an interview between John Lear and the National
Fringe Sciences (Computer) Bulletin Board:

"Question: You just mentioned that there were... other 'species' in contact
with this world... are they aware of the EBE's?

"Lear: Yes they are. The types I will mention are listed in a USAF Academy
Physics book called 'INTRODUCTORY SPACE SCIENCE VOLUME 2,B.' I refer to
chapter 13... which lists the ones that are most seen. They are the EBE's,
the 'Blondes'... They look just like us but are invariably blond haired and
blue eyed. Don't know where they come from but they do not interact with us
except for a few abductions now and then. We also have a species that is
similar to us in appearance but they are about seven feet tall and the main
difference is that their eyes wrap around their head a little more than
ours. Another type listed is a small species about four feet tall, very
hairy and extremely strong for their size. We don't know where these guys
come from either. All this was in the aforementioned text which was
WITHDRAWN by the Air Force in the early '70's from the book. But there are
several people who have the original book...

"Question: I'm curious also as to the government's plans, if any, to deal
with an uprising of EBE's should that eventually occur... or would the
technological gap make an attempt untenable?

"Lear: It is my understanding that we have already lost the battle. This is
the reason why MJ-12 is in such a panic. They had a lot of well laid plans
to INFORM us, and when the deception was confirmed about 1984 it was all
out the window...

"Question: Recently in the INF treaty negotiations, Gorbachev indicated
that despite prior claims, they too were working on an SDI program... Is
there any connection between our program and theirs and if the battle is
lost, why are those attempts being made?

"Lear: I wish I knew the answer to that. Several rumors have come out of
the test site recently and one of them was that every test shot this year
(1989? - Branton) has been to make a giant (underground - Branton) room.
The shots are very clean and as soon as everything subsides they move in
equipment to make walls, ceiling, floors and various levels."

If in fact the SDI program(s) are being used to defend the earth from
foreign or alien forces, then someone 'somewhere' might not appreciate such
projects. Whether it is the serpent cults or the serpent race, someone or
'something' seems to have been behind the mysterious deaths of several SDI
scientists.

British UFOlogist Timothy Good, in his book 'UFO REPORT' (Avon Books.,
N.Y., 1989), describes the unfortunate fate of several experts who assisted
in the development of the STAR WARS defense system. Apparently, they were
either eliminated by those they worked for so that they would not reveal
what they knew, or someone or something 'else' that was displeased with the
ultimate product of their efforts was responsible for their tragic deaths.
Certainly, all of these scientists dying at once cannot be explained in
coincidental terms, whatever the case:

     "...Reports of suspicious deaths, darkly and deeply linked to
     UFO's, persist, however, and continue to cause speculation. Word
     comes from Gordon Creighton, editor of the informative FLYING
     SAUCER REVIEW, who notes a possible deathly tie-in with the U.S.
     'Star Wars' program. He wrote to me in Nov. 1988 as follows:

     "'...here in Britain 22 scientists have reportedly either taken
     their own lives or died in very strange or mysterious
     circumstances. And it seems that most... were engaged in British
     work on behalf of, or related to the U.S. 'Star Wars' program.
     The British government, it seems, was trying to hush it up. But
     press statements here say that the U.S. government had put our
     government on the spot and demanded a full inquiry. So, quite
     clearly, it is either the Russians or THEM...'

     "As many researchers have surmised, 'Star Wars', ostensibly
     conceived as a defensive system against Russian missile attack,
     may have had from it's beginning a 'defensive' UFO connection.
     Whatever the case, a 'mock test' in September, 1988, of an earth-
     shattering warhead -- much like 'Star Wars' in reverse -- was
     conducted at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. Announced as a
     proposed super-weapon designed to destroy Russian underground
     command centers dug in solid rock down to 1,000 (feet), some UFO
     analysts believe that the real target is not Russian but another
     adversary deep down in cavernous installations IN NEVADA AND NEW
     MEXICO.

     "According to the Pentagon, the proposed earth-penetrating
     warhead is 'urgently needed'. According to rumor-mills, an alien
     race -- the 'grays' -- in their fortified underground
     laboratories, are genetically experimenting with the human race.
     Even more ominous, rumors say that their intransigence today may
     lead to new perils tomorrow."

The following confirming article appeared in Washington State's 'SEATTLE'
newspaper, p. 1, Oct. 8, 1988 issue. The article, which originated from the
'Hearst News Service', was written by reporter Bernard D. Kaplan, and
titled: 'BAFFLING CASE OF 10 DEAD SCIENTISTS - SOMETHING SINISTER?' Below
the article is quoted in its entirety:

     "PARIS -- They're calling it the 'Star Wars Mystery' -- the
     enigmatic deaths of 10 British scientists and technicians, all of
     whom worked on projects linked to President Reagan's space- based
     anti-missile program, the Strategic Defense Initiative.

     "All of the deaths have occurred within the past 24 months, since
     Britain began to contribute to 'Star Wars' research.

     "All took place in mysterious or violent circumstances.

     "Four of the deaths were recorded as suicides and two as a result
     of accidents. In four other cases, coroner's juries handed down
     an 'open' verdict, meaning they could not determine how the
     victims died.

     "The latest case came two weeks ago. Andrew Hall, a 33- year-old
     engineer with the British Aerospace company, was found suffocated
     in his car, a hosepipe connected to the exhaust. Verdict:
     suicide.

     "Only a month earlier, Alistair Beckham, a senior space engineer
     with another major defense contractor, PLESSEY, was discovered in
     his garden shed, bound up in electric wires running to his house.
     He had been electrocuted.

     "Although Beckham's death was ruled a suicide, his widow was
     convinced he was murdered.

     "'Alistair had no personal or professional problems,' Mary
     Beckham said. 'He wasn't subject to depression. Murder is the
     sole explanation that is reasonable.'

     "Member of Parliament Douglas Hoyle, who issued a call for an
     official investigation into the strange string of deaths even
     before the Beckham case, agrees that 'something sinister' appears
     to be going on.

     "'The number of these deaths is now becoming too odd to be a
     coincidence any more,' he insists.

     "The government has so far turned down Hoyle's demand, but last
     week ordered the police forces who investigated the nine deaths
     to 'exchange information.'

     "Sources said NATO intelligence authorities in Brussels recently
     asked their British counterparts for a report on the affair.

     "'Five of the men who died worked in sensitive posts for the same
     defense contractor, BRITISH MARCONI,' a NATO source said. 'Two
     were senior scientists at the Royal Military College of Science.
     We'd be remiss in our duty if we didn't take a very close look
     into this matter.'

     "Chief Superintendent Arthur Ford, the policeman put in charge of
     coordinating the investigations, insists nothing has been found
     to link the deaths.

     "Hoyle says that's 'nonsense.' He pointed out that two others,
     LIKE Hall, died from fumes in locked cars whose engines were
     running.

     "Police officials continue to theorize that the deaths were
     attributed to personal stress to which defense industry
     scientists are often subjected. Marconi personnel manager John
     Shipley dismisses that notion.

     "'We investigated each (of the five Marconi employee deaths),' he
     says. 'We didn't find a single instance of work stress or even
     suspicion of it,' he said.

     "Besides Hall and Beckham, these people died:

     "--Marconi scientist Ashad Sharif was found in his car with a
     rope tied from his neck to a nearby tree on October 1986. The car
     had lurched forward, choking Sharif to death. Open verdict.

     "--Ministry of Defense computer specialist Richard Pugh was found
     with a plastic bag over his head in January 1987. Ruled an
     accident.

     "--Royal Military College scientist John Brittan, found
     suffocated in his car in the same month. 'Accidental death.'

     "--Marconi design engineer Victor Moore, found in February 1987
     dead of an apparent drug overdose. Verdict: suicide.

     "--Royal Military College scientist Peter Peapell found run over
     by a car the same month. Open verdict.

     "--Marconi satellite project manager David Sands drove his car
     loaded with gasoline cans into a wall in April 1987. Open
     verdict.

     "--Marconi weapons engineer Trevor Knight, found in a car with a
     hose connected to the exhaust this March. Apparent suicide.

     "--Marconi scientist John Ferry, found electrocuted, in July
     1988. Open verdict...."

Many UFO encounters, especially with human-like personages, have been
relatively friendly and benevolent in nature. Yet there is, nevertheless, a
far more malevolent group which has reportedly caused physical harm or even
death to unfortunate witnesses who became a target in a cosmic war being
waged against mankind by beings which apparently have little or no regard
for human life. In his article, 'INCREDIBLE UFO INCINERATION'S: CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS OF THE COMBUSTIBLE KIND', researcher Larry E. Arnold describes
the following terrifying encounter, only one of several cases of
UFO-related 'human combustion' mentioned in his article:

"...Of the many episodes involving UFOs and the spontaneous combustion of
humans, quite probably the most disastrous event -- if true -- in MODERN
times occurred to the African village of Kirimukuya on Mt. Kenya.

"For several nights in June 1954, young Laili Thindu and his shepherd
companions listened to the pounding of their neighbors' drums announcing a
wedding about to take place on the mountainside. They also watched STRANGE
LIGHTS soar around this 'sacred' peak in central Kenya. They naturally were
startled when bright beams flashed from these soaring lights, then
concerned that the drums were now silent.

"The next morning Laili learned that 'all the dancers, all the children,
all the livestock, -- the entire population of the village -- had been
seared to death by terrible streams of light from glowing objects,' report
Brad Steiger and Joan Whritenour in their book , FLYING SAUCERS ARE
HOSTILE. 'It was not until Laili Thindu ventured into Nairobi that he was
able to tell his story to someone who recognized the tale for what it
really was: the annihilation of an African village by a UFO..."

The Kenyans are not the only ones to have suffered from "alien" attacks
upon its inhabitants. The U.S. Military is well aware of this threat of
unknown invaders of U.S. Airspace, as is evident in the following quote:

     "We have stacks of report about flying saucers. WE TAKE THEM
     SERIOUSLY when you consider WE HAVE LOST MANY MEN AND PLANES
     TRYING TO INTERCEPT THEM."

     -- February, 1953. Statement by U.S. General CHIDLAW in charge of
     the United States Continental Air Defense.

There are many indications suggesting that certain humans have, in one way
or another, been brought under the mental, technical or occult control of
the 'reptilians' over the years -- whether they are fully aware of this
manipulation or not. Could the 'being' referred to in the following
account, which appeared on pp. 1136-1137 of Raymond A. Palmer's 'HIDDEN
WORLD' publication for Summer, 1962, be the type of subterranean- dwelling
creature which at least one account has referred to as a a 'dragon-worm'?
Could this creature (supposing it does in fact exist and is not the result
of one man's deluded and misguided fantasy experience) be one of the MANY
and VARIED branches or mutations of the 'serpent' races, which many
accounts tend to confirm as existing within subterranean areas? It would
seem that accounts such as this one might raise more questions than
answers. Remember that this letter appeared years before the advent of the
famous 'Star Wars' trilogy which depicted a creature very similar to that
described in the following letter. Again, one may wonder if George Lucas
himself might not have been inspired subconsciously by certain evident
realities, and portrayed some of these -- although in a rather
sensationalized manner -- in his movies. The following account was
submitted by a reader who chose to remain anonymous. He states:

     "Dear Ray: ...This happened about 12 or 13 years ago. I was in my
     late teens, I think, but perhaps the time is not as important as
     the incident.

     "In the late night hours I awoke, got out of bed, walked out of
     the house and was met by a group of men (?) who drove me out into
     the country to an old farmhouse. I don't know the location any
     more than the people involved; maybe I was drugged, I don't know.
     At the farmhouse we went immediately to the potato cellar and
     through a trapdoor in the floor down a long inclining tunnel. We
     arrived into a room, fantastically decorated, bizarre, like Hades
     -- how can I describe it? It was of good size; and others were
     present. Some one asked: 'Is he ready?' and the answer: 'Yes, he
     is.' Two 'others' -- one on each side of me escorted me into a
     room? Tunnel? (again beyond my description) the worm, or whoever
     or whatever he or it was, was huge, long, round, knobby. An
     immense head and mouth (which swayed back and forth) spoke to me.
     I don't remember what it said or my answer, but one of them put a
     syringe into it, and then into me! I swear the language spoken by
     them AND MYSELF was not English, but somehow I seemed to know,
     yet but not know. After some kind of warning and benediction from
     this being I was escorted out. Once again the car, the return
     trip, and home in bed. Since that time I have once in awhile
     visited the caves quite unhindered... in dreams and the like
     (since 'suppressed' memories of experiences with UFO's, etc.
     often surface in 'dreams' or impressions, could these be actual
     memories of other visits to the nether regions which were
     suppressed from his memory? There is also the small chance that
     ray-induced visions or even 'astral' interaction might be
     involved as well, that is, the "abduction" of the spirit body
     from the soul and physical bodies. The physical-soul body
     presumably remains attached to the disembodied spirit-essence via
     a silvery cord or beam of energy which maintains a kind of
     hyperspace link between them - Branton).

     "I can only comment that the knowledge of, and use of the mechs,
     the architecture, the philosophies in the pictures (or whatever
     they are), would enable man to live like gods in comparison to
     how they now live. However the areas of horror beyond
     comprehension would have to be removed before this can be done
     (Note: The writer may be referring to the so-called super- human
     abilities brought about through the use or manipulation of
     powerful electromagnetic occult technologies. We must remind the
     reader that 'power' has NOTHING to do with benevolence or
     "right"-eousness, or as the old saying goes: 'Might does not make
     right!' Such abilities to manipulate the forces of nature via
     occult technologies -- such as those which were developed and
     utilized by the antediluvians, which by the way may have played a
     role in their destruction, and which is now being used by many of
     the inhabitants of the nether 'cavern' regions -- could be
     extremely destructive if placed in the wrong hands - Branton).

     "An interesting sequel to this (dream or reality?) is that I have
     prayed, hard, that this wouldn't affect my life. I believe in
     some ways it hasn't, but my wife feels that something, as I also
     have felt, is not allowing me to live as I want to. Of course I
     want to know, was it dream or reality? (Name deleted by
     request)."

The following letter appeared in the July, 1964 issue of 'SEARCH' Magazine,
and was written by a Mr. Ervin M. Scott of (at that time) 536 12th St.,
Denver, Colorado. Mr. Scott's references to the origin of "dreams" is
interesting. There are theories that the brain acts like a biological
electrochemical "radio" transceiver at some levels. It is a proven fact
that the brain sends very subtle neuro-electrical transmissions into the
atmos- phere, and that these "brain waves" can be recorded by electro-
encephelograph machines. An even more daring theory is that neurons can
interact and affect other particles-waves in the Unified Field and that the
brain has the ability to "focus" these waves as a transmitter or a
receiver. Of course the success of long-range communication between minds
is minimal when compared with radio waves, because of the thick morass of
'psychic static' that must be penetrated and the minimal energy output.
Others claim that certain "alien" cultures have machines that are capable
of electronically magnifying and focusing thought waves for transmitting or
receiving. As for "dreams", some believe that they take place when the mind
tunes-in to a "deeper" mental states wherein the mind is able to tap into
the thought- forms of a "collective unconscious", explaining the "universal
dream symbolism" which has been reported by psychologists. One symbolic
explanation that has been used to explain this process is that of islands
that appear to be separate and distinct when seen above water -- symbolic
of individual conscious minds, yet the "deeper" one goes below the
"surface" the more they connect with other islands at the underlying levels
-- symbolic of the increasing levels of the collective unconscious mind(s).
Mr. Scott describes his unusual experiences as follows:

     "Dear Ray: ...Congratulations on another excellent issue of
     'SEARCH' Magazine.

     "I was especially interested in your article, 'Faces in Your
     Dreams.'

     "Having had many strange, puzzling dreams over the last few
     years, I have become quite interested in any clues that might
     point towards origin and cause of dreams. I recognize a good many
     as probably having the subconscious as the source. However, there
     is an occasional dream, that is so vivid and unusual that it
     causes one to wonder.

     "I have no connection one way or the other, on the Shaver
     Mystery, but, I will briefly describe... dreams that are
     interesting in relation to that subject.

     "On Nov. 30, 1963 while in a light sleep I heard a woman's voice
     coming as if from a distance and she spoke urgently as follows:
     'This is from a stolen farm beneath the Salt Lake flats in Utah.
     (I was living in Wichita, Kansas at the time.) There was a woman
     abducted almost three weeks ago in Boston, Mass. and taken
     underground. Reports indicate that an abbey in North section of
     the city is being used and that cellars underneath the abbey
     connect with tunnels leading up from caverns below. This is a
     continuation of the Evil one's War against Mankind.'

     "Another voice broke in, 'Don't believe her. Don't you see this
     is a lie - a trick? (Then, warningly) Keep quiet about this.'

     "I have never been in Utah nor have had no thoughts about or
     desire to visit, so if this was caused by subconscious, it is
     certainly puzzling, as is the reference to 'a stolen farm'..."

This letter suggests that a conflict of sorts has been and is taking place
in cavernous levels below Utah, as in other states.

Earlier in this file we revealed an incident which was originally described
by 'Commander X', from a source in Dulce, N.M., stating that a certain
chemical was secretly (via certain 'doctors' tied in with the aliens) being
injected into individuals via sulfa drugs which in turn lodged in the
bone-structure of the victim. This chemical allegedly makes their bodies
extremely sensitive to ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) radio waves, which can
be 'tuned in' to the deep encephalographic wave bands of the human brain,
and these transmissions could apparently be used to subliminally control or
at least influence human minds from a distance.

Perhaps some individuals, such as the writer of the letter just quoted, are
naturally sensitive to these extremely low frequency waves, in that their
brains to some extent act as an electro- chemical biological ELF radio
receiver. Certain accounts suggest that various subterranean groups utilize
ELF radio transceivers capable of penetrating many miles of solid rock.

The letter just quoted might "suggest" that another group, more malevolent,
utilize a similar form (of ELF radio wave transceivers?) such as the one
through which the woman apparently sent out the 'distress' or warning call.

Could this 'other' voice be tied-in with a subterranean group similar to
the 'Horlocks' mentioned earlier in this File? Or could it have originated
from the Reptilians? The 'Horlocks' are, as we've suggested earlier, a
group of human 'mind-slaves' who are possibly manipulated and kept under
reptilian mind-control via implantation, technosis, and so on.

Various sources have described many strange subsurface phenomena associated
with the Salt Lake or Great Basin subnet. Some of these include:

1) A reference to a system of tunnels and catacombs allegedly existing
below the Salt Lake Valley, which were said to exist long before the first
settlers moved in. Unusual stories have made the rounds to the effect that
early construction workers in downtown SLC broke through into these
underground tunnels. Some of these passages were later expanded by early
polygamists who entered them to take refuge from government prosecutors.
Others who entered certain of these tunnels never returned. Additional
"rumors" say that "Lizard People" have been encountered in some of the
deeper tunnels, as well as unusual footprints of creatures with three toes.
There are also reports of seemingly "bottomless shafts". Also huge passages
"large enough to drive a truck through" are said to lead southwest from
downtown Salt Lake City to other chambers below the western Rockies,
especially below the Cottonwood Canyons.

It is interesting that the Mayan- Telosians claim to have a large base
under Big Cottonwood Canyon, The Mormon Church has a huge underground
storage shelter below Little Cottonwood Canyon, and the tunnels in down-
town SLC are also said to connect with the basement of the Masonic Temple
there. ALL THREE groups possess an initiatory order of "Melchizedek" within
their structures... interesting! Also, there have been reports of
encounters with NORDICS as well as abductions by REPTILIANS near these
canyons. One witness swore that at night she was taken out of her house in
Salt Lake City by a blond man in a black "astronaut" uniform, who showed
her a "Star Wars" scenario taking place above the Cottonwood Canyons. She
saw [cloaked?] disks emerging from Twin Peaks only to fire beams of energy
at incoming UFOs. The beams hit what appeared to be the force shields of
the incoming craft and in "Star Trek" like fashion the energy crackled
around the UFOs, many of which seemed to lose motive power and drift away.
Could this area be one of the "Stand-off" zones between the Benevolent Ones
and the Reptilian Grays that John Lear, Agent YF and other sources have
referred to?

Aside from these mountain bases, other underground systems are said to run
southwest under Trolley Square [where workers also reportedly "broke in" to
underground catacombs in years past] and also the old Sugerhouse Mall
district. At least two individuals have reported "abductions" from this
area. One man stated that he was taken underground just north of
Sugerhouse, and was "operated on", his right leg removed and reattached.
Although the experience seemed "dreamlike", when he found himself at home
once again he stood up and his right leg gave out under him. Another
person, a woman, reported being abducted and taken into huge underground
chambers by way of a maze, just west of Sugarhouse Mall. She was placed in
an altered state -- it also seemed to be "dreamlike", but she did
experience "missing time". She reportedly encountered a tall, dark haired
man who was in the company of a "Gray" alien, and he gave her and several
other people in the chambers different instructions -- which she cannot
consciously remember. One other incident was reported by a woman who was
part of a night cleaning crew in the multi-levelled Crossroads Mall. She
claimed that one night a creature came around a corner, wobbled up to her,
and snarled viciously as it went past. She could only describe it as a
"demon", however the apparent physical tangibility of the creature may
suggest that it was one of the so-called "lizard people" or reptilians that
are rumored to stalk the lower tunnels below the Mall. One worker who had
gone into the tunnels reportedly placed his hand against one tunnel wall at
which point his arm went THROUGH the wall -- an extremely unnerving
experience. The next time he was there he attempted the same thing, but the
wall was "solid". Could the "aliens" temporarily "phase shift" the
molecules within an underground passage in order to pass through to hidden
chambers beyond? Others have reported passing rooms from which an unusual
greenish luminescence emanated. Others speak of tunnels that have been
sealed or locked by wooden doors that seemed to be ancient, or by metal
doors or gates. There are also reports of people entering the sewer or
drainage tunnels under downtown SLC, peeking into huge chambers, and seeing
"men in suits" carrying uzi machine guns. Could these be Mormon Church
security officers protecting the basement levels of "Temple Square" from
unwanted alien intruders from BELOW?

2) Certain geologists state that the Great Salt Lake has an underground
counterpart deep below it, and that a certain type of earthquake could
'conceivably' empty the entire contents of the lake into it's subterranean
counterpart. There are vague rumors of underground streams or rivers which
allegedly flow from HUGE caverns in the heart of the Wasatch Mts./Western
Rockies (caverns which can supposedly be entered by following the right
path through the underground maze), and westward below the valley floor,
possibly to the underground 'counterpart' of the Great Salt Lake.

3) A former worker in Utah's 'Dougway Proving Ground' (where former Dulce
Base worker Thomas Castello alleges there is an 'entrance' to the
underground systems) reported that he witnessed 'people' working at the
base-facility who were NOT human. He could not explain, but he did state
that he learned of top secret robotics and even 'Philadelphia-Experiment'
like teleportation research that was being conducted at the base. Also,
there have been reports (similar to those at Dulce, NM; the Nevada] Test
Site; the Madigan Medical facility in Washington State, and at Deep
Springs, CA), particularly from a former hairdresser at the Dougway base
whose name was Barbara, that there were several reptilian beings working at
the base who were masquerading as humans. She stated that even one of the
base commanders was NOT human -- she saw him momentarily transform before
her eyes!

4) There are many accounts of various alien 'bases' throughout Utah
occupied by the Nordics, the Grays, secret societies, the large 'EL'
humans, possibly the 'Orange', and of course the 'hubrids' -- and possibly
even natural-born humans who are being held prisoner in 'reptilian'
strongholds.

This latter possibility was confirmed by Val Valerian in 'THE LEADING EDGE'
Newsletter, in which he stated his belief that, based on the numerous
accounts that he had gathered:

     "...Scores of underground installations hold citizens of
     virtually every country on the planet in captivity."

Valerian is of course referring to the Dulce facility, as well as other
such facilities throughout the world where permanent abductees' reportedly
end up. This may also include other people who have disappeared in other
ways.

One possible subterranean 'abduction' was described by researcher John
Grant. In his book 'GREAT MYSTERIES' (Chartwell Books., Secaucus, NJ.,
1988), Grant records the following frightening incident: "...In 1975 Mr.
and Mrs. Jackson Wright were driving to New York through blinding snow; in
the Lincoln Tunnel they agreed to pause and wipe snow from the front and
rear windows. Jackson Wright never saw his wife, Martha, again."

People just don't 'disappear' without a trace, never to be heard from
again, especially in a place like this unless SOMETHING intentionally
causes such a disappearance to take place. There have, incidentally, been
reports of 'UFO' like objects and/or alien creatures being seen in
connection with 'abductions' which took place in underground tunnels, some
'deserted' by our standards and others not. One case involved some teenaged
boys in Europe who swore that their abductors (grays) took them to a base
underground via a long-abandoned World War II railway tunnel.

It is uncertain just how many human casualties the human race may have
suffered as a result of the Da'ath or Dah'ath wars over the centuries
(Da'ath is the Hebrew name of the 'tree' where, tradition holds, the human
and serpent races first came into conflict), yet based on the various
accounts which we have covered in this Fil, we can assume that the victims
have been in the tens of thousands AT THE VERY LEAST.

In the meantime, the abductions of humans, an integral part of the 'evil
ones' warfare against God and men's souls, are still taking place. Whether
the victims are taken to underground or off-planet areas is difficult to
tell in any given case, although there is reason to believe that both
possibilities are a reality.

There have, believe it or not, been abductions which have occurred in
connection with 'UFO' activity that have involved not a few, not dozens,
nor hundreds but THOUSANDS of people who have disappeared without a trace,
or been abducted, en masse. Such is the case with the following well-known
and documented incident that has baffled the many researchers who have
mentioned it in their writings:

"In the Winter of 1930 a profoundly disturbing incident took place in
Canada. Trapper Arnaud Lauret and his son observed a strange light crossing
the northern sky. It appeared to be headed for the Lake Anjikuni area. The
two trappers described it as being alternatingly bullet-shaped and
cylinder-shaped...

"Another trapper named Joe LaBelle had snowshoed into the village of the
Lake Anjikuni people, and been chilled to discover that the normally
bustling community was silent, and not a soul was moving in the streets.
Even the sled dogs, which would normally have bayed welcome, were silent.
The shanties were choked with snow, and not a chimney showed smoke.

"The trapper found the village kayaks tied up on the shore of the lake.
Inside the shanties the trapper found a further surprise: there were meals
left hanging over fires, long grown old and moldy, apparently abandoned as
they were being cooked. The men's rifles were still standing by the doors.
This really frightened the trapper, because he knew that these people would
NEVER leave their precious weapons behind.

"He reported his discovery to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who
investigated further. They discovered that the town's dogs died of hunger,
chained beneath a tree and covered by a snowdrift. More disturbingly, the
town graveyard had been emptied. The graves were now yawning pits. Despite
the frozen ground, the graves had been opened and the dead removed..."

Whitley Strieber, who claimed to have had several abduction- type
experiences since a young age involving different types of beings -- both
apparently physical and paraphysial -- does not hold to the idea that these
creatures are originally from deep space. He believes that some of them MAY
come from the nether regions of the earth, and may have been here for
millennia, being part of an ancient conspiracy to occultically control or
manipulate the human race. He is not certain exactly what the creatures
behind his abductions were, but he did suggest that the ancient (fallen?)
'elementals' might be involved. Strieber had some comments of his own
concerning the strange mass abduction near the Lake Anjikuni area. In his
book 'MAJESTIC', he stated:

"The RCMP continues the case opened to this day. A check with the records
department indicated that the matter remains unsolved, and despite a search
of the whole of Canada and inquiries throughout the world, not a single
trace of the MISSING TWELVE HUNDRED MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN were ever
found." Strieber related still another incident in this same book, of a
mysterious abduction (apparently) to underground regions:

"...The first seemingly related case of disappearance in the U.S. history
(that is, 'related' to cases given by Strieber earlier in his book,
concerning people who were allegedly pursued by unknown objects and
experienced NEAR abductions yet managed to escape -- and others who were
captured in the full sight of witnesses and never seen again - Branton)...
took place on 23 September 1880 near the town of Gallatin, Tennessee. At
approximately three-thirty on that sunny afternoon, Mr. David Lang, a
farmer, dematerialized in front of five witnesses, including his wife, his
two children, his father-in-law and a local judge.

"The father-in-law and the judge had just pulled up in a carriage. Mr. Lang
moved toward them across a field followed by his family. Without warning,
he simply ceased to exist. There was no cry, no sign of distress. Mrs.
Lang, distraught, rushed up and pounded the ground where he had been
walking. All that afternoon, and into the night the field was searched.
Subsequently the county surveyor determined that there were no hidden caves
or sinkholes in the area of the disappearance.

"The subsequent April, seven months later," Streiber writes, "the children
heard their father crying distantly UNDERNEATH the field. He seemed
desperate and tortured, and was begging for help. His voice gradually died
away and was not heard again. Where he was last seen, there was a circle of
WITHERED yellow grass twenty feet in diameter.

"The family moved away from the farm.

"It can be surmised that Mr. Lang was not removed above ground, but rather
was taken INTO THE EARTH and kept alive there for some months," Strieber
continues, "judging from the cries that were heard the next April. What the
poor man suffered during that time, and what finally put him out of his
misery, can scarcely be imagined...

"He was apparently left to languish in some subterranean prison, presumably
dying when his food and water ran out."

Evidence is beginning to mount that many of the human and animal organs
from mutilation victims are being used by an entirely different 'alien'
group than the reptilians-saurians, although the sauroids are apparently
working in full cooperation with this "other" group by assisting in the
construction of physical-biological 'forms' which can be 'possessed' and
animated by an insidious group of SUPERNATURAL non-physical entities, the
'infernals' or 'polter- giests'. Whitley Streiber stated that he
encountered some of these entities during an abduction, and noticed an area
on their craft where these malevolent, fearful creatures stored these
'bodies' when they were not in use. These energy beings, he came to
realize, used such physical shells to operate in the physical dimension,
much like a human being enters a diving suit in order to operate under
water.

The LEADING EDGE Magazine for March, 1990, quoted one 'inside' source as
saying that: "These beings... have a PHYSICAL presence generate biological
structures that function as CONTAINERS for them... the aliens manufacture
containers for themselves... fabricate their own bodies -- using
biologicals gained from humans and cattle..."

A publication titled 'AMERICA'S MISSING & EXPLOITED CHILDREN' (published by
the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention, Washington D.C.) made the following statement: "Even the most
conservative estimates suggest that SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND children are
missing within the course of the year." (in the United States alone). Also:
"...In 1983, the U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services put the number at
1.5 million a year -- a figure that has been widely circulated by private
organizations. But experts say roughly 95 percent of these are runaways --
many of whom return home within days and are counted repeatedly if they run
away more than once a year." This would apparently put the number of those
who are 'abducted' in one way or another to AT LEAST 75,000 per year...
STILL A CONSIDERABLY LARGE NUMBER.

'Commander X', from his apparent though guarded vantage- point within the
Intelligence Community, claims to be privy to much 'deep-level' inside
information, as we have seen in earlier writings. One of the reports that
crossed his desk involved the experience of a woman who was 'abducted' and
taken over 1000 miles to the underground facility below Dulce, New Mexico:

     "...One woman I have spoken with was abducted from the roof of a
     New York City apartment building and apparently held underground
     at the Dulce facility. She was taken to a cabin in the desert
     which was being used as a camouflaged entrance to the 'alien'
     base. She was eventually escorted to the laboratories to be used
     as a test subject, but at the last minute managed to escape
     thanks to the aid of one of the Nordic-type, tall aliens, who
     befriended her and showed her a secret way out, down an unguarded
     shaft.

     "Back in the desert, she was rescued by members of the Blue
     Berets, and eventually flown back to Manhattan. During a de-
     briefing session with the military, she was warned to remain
     silent about her experiences. Anyone hearing such a bizarre tale
     would certainly think she had gone insane. It was inferred she
     could be committed to a mental institution at any time should she
     refuse to go along with the cover-up conspiracy, which she was
     told was being conducted 'for the sake of the country, and the
     sake of the world!'" (if you believe that excuse, then I have
     some beachfront property on Mercury that you might be interested
     in! - Branton)

William Cooper stated at the MUFON symposium in Las Vegas in 1989 that over
3,000 children disappear yearly in one section of Manhattan alone. Could
there be some connection!?

The accounts of disappearances around underground tunnels and caverns are
seemingly endless, as we see in the following incident recorded in Harold
T. Wilkins' book 'FLYING SAUCERS UNCENSORED', p. 47:

     "June 7, 1954: Three German tourists who entered the vast
     Lamprecht Cave, near Lofer, in the Salzburg mountain region of
     Austria have never been found. Their automobile was left locked
     outside the cave.

     "...The above may very well be merely a case of amateur
     speleologists getting lost in labyrinthine caves, although it is
     unusual for THREE men to vanish in this fashion. But I must risk
     the charge of being accused of fancy and moonshine, when I say
     that both in England and the United States, there are regions of
     limestone caverns and mountains from which...queer phenomena
     associated with white lights descending to ground level from
     great altitudes have been reported!"

Similar disappearances were recorded by John Keel in his book 'OUR HAUNTED
PLANET', pp. 202-208:

     "...There are periodic waves of disappearances which create brief
     sensations in the newspapers and are quickly forgotten. No one
     ever manages to find out where these people have gone. In 1912
     five men, all unrelated, disappeared unaccountably in a single
     week in Buffalo, New York. Montreal, Canada, had a wave of
     missing persons in July, 1883, and again in July, 1892.

     "Children vanish MORE FREQUENTLY than any other group. We're not
     talking about ordinary runaways. In August, 1869, thirteen
     children vanished in Cork, Ireland. No sign of kidnapping or foul
     play. The same month there was a wave of disappearing children in
     Brussels, Belgium. Another group of youngsters melted away in
     Belfast in August, 1895. And again in August, 1920, eight girls
     (all under twelve years of age) disappeared forever in Belfast...

     "Actually, children have been disappearing in large numbers for
     centuries all over the world, and most of these cases have
     remained unsolved. In the Middle Ages it was popularly believed
     that fairies and leprechauns frequently stole children away. The
     Indians of North and South America also have many myths and
     stories about children being kidnapped by little people. The
     notion that parahumans kidnap children is deeply entrenched in
     every culture...

     "The celebrated Pied Piper of Hameln, Germany, is more than just
     a charming children's story. A stranger actually did appear in
     Hameln in the Middle Ages, and he lured away 150 children never
     to be seen again. The event is still commemorated with an annual
     festival in Hameln (one of the old versions of the story says
     that the children were taken to a subterranean cavern - Branton).

     "In A.D. 1212 a teenaged boy in France, Stephen of Cloyes, BEGAN
     TO HEAR VOICES which inspired him to collect together fifty
     thousand children for the pathetic Children's Crusade. They
     marched off to do battle with the infidels and disappeared EN
     MASSE. The popular explanation is that they were all seized by
     slavers.

     "...Ufologist Jerome Clark uncovered an extraordinary item from
     an old 1939 newspaper. 'On a day in the late summer, 1939, a
     military transport left the Marine Naval Air Station in San
     Diego, California, for a routine flight to Honolulu,' Clark wrote
     in FLYING SAUCER REVIEW. 'About three hours afterwards several
     urgent distress signals sounded from the plane and then silence.
     Later the craft came limping back to execute an emergency
     landing. When Air Station personnel entered the plane, they found
     every man of the crew, including the copilot who had lived long
     enough to pilot the craft back to its base, dead of unknown
     causes.

     "Each of the bodies carried large, gaping wounds, and the outside
     of the ship was similarly marked. Air Station men who touched
     parts of the craft came down with a mysterious skin infection.

     "One of the most puzzling aspects of the whole affair was that
     the .45 automatics carried by the pilot and copilot as service
     pieces HAD BEEN EMPTIED, AND THE SHELLS LAY ON THE FLOOR. A smell
     of rotten eggs pervaded the atmosphere inside the plane...
     Mysterious skin infections and rotten egg odors (hydrogen
     sulfide) are phenomena familiar to all UFO researchers. It would
     seem that the transport was attacked -- apparently without
     provocation -- by some sort of strange aerial intruder."

The following account, taken from the May, 1946 issue of AMAZING STORIES
magazine (pp. 171-173) seems to contain information which would explain
many of the 'missing pieces' of the overall 'Men In Black' phenomena. At
least some of the 'MIB' have been variously described as oriental or
'androidal' like beings, although as John Keel has stated, others seem to
portray reptilian characteristics. Abductee Christa Tilton allegedly
encountered some 'MIBs' in a black automobile within Boynton Canyon, near
Sedona, Arizona (a reported base site). She described them as follows: "The
men did not look right. Their faces had no expression on them whatsoever.
They looked like they were wearing chalky tan makeup. Their movements were
robot-like and unearthly." The AMAZING STORIES letter, which was quite
lengthy and excerpts of which we quote below, was submitted by a Mr. Edward
John of (at the time) 475 Fell St., San Francisco, CA.:

     "Sirs... I have enjoyed your stories for many years as I have
     read AMAZING since the first issue back in 1928 if I remember
     right.

     "...I think I can show you an entrance to this subterranean city
     that he (Shaver) has written about several issues back. Here is
     what happened to me and you may judge for yourself. In 1931 my
     mother and I took up a section of land as a cattle raising home-
     stead from the U.S. Government and naturally it was not a choice
     piece... a person who turned out to be our nearest neighbor gave
     us some hints and as the place was only six miles from his we
     stayed at his ranch until we built our house. Then we moved into
     our own and all in all we stayed there about two years before we
     quite; and now I will relate the things that caused us to quit,
     which at the time I did not know much about, but since Mr. Shaver
     wrote, now I know and marvel that we managed to stand two years
     without getting killed by these things from below.

     "As a note of interest I have had to use 30,000 rounds of
     ammunition in the period and perhaps that is why we are still
     here. At night I would sit up fully dressed all night with a
     rifle in my hands, ready, and an extra one by my side. In about
     five hours after dark I would hear things moving outside the
     house and after a while something would try to open the door
     quietly and I would wait until I saw the knob turn, then let go a
     clip right through the door and then pull it open and look around
     outside and there was nothing to be seen. After a couple of
     nights like that, that performance would stop and something new
     would be tried.

     "There are too many incidents to be told in one letter, the best
     one was the two disappearing automobiles, which happened at about
     ten at night over at the neighbor's place. It was as follows: the
     neighbor and we were sitting on the porch after supper when he
     saw headlights come over the hill to the fence then along the
     fence for about half a mile, then go out and that was all that
     night. So next morning we went to the trail along the fence and
     there were tire tracks of seven inch width tires and they went
     along the fence into the box canyon and right up against a smooth
     boulder about 20 feet in diameter and ended there. Now the car
     could not turn around anywhere in that place because the road is
     a trail five feet wide and one side is against our neighbor's
     fence, which was not damaged and the other was a steep hill that
     no car could even make in compound low. You know, we have a few
     mountains here, and as far as backing out I tried that myself in
     the daytime with help and I could not steer a straight enough
     path without crossing my other marks so they did not back out or
     we would have trailed them as my neighbor has lived around there
     since 1848 and he sure knew his tracking. We never did get an
     answer to the question of where did the cars go.

     "The cars were very large and black and very heavy and now that I
     compare them they were about twenty years ahead of anything I
     have ever seen anywhere and I had worked in the auto business for
     about five years before we took up the land. They were silent,
     smooth, no wavering of the lights and the trail is extremely
     rough; in places it has hollows a yard deep, but these cars went
     through at about 25 mph, and it would even wreck a jeep to do
     that, so you figure it out and let me know the answer if you can.
     By wavering of lights, I mean that the beams were steady and not
     flashing up and down as an ordinary car would do when a rough
     road is traveled.

     "I have been away from there since 1933, but just about three
     months ago, I drove through with a friend for safety and my place
     is razed to the ground and everything that was made by human
     hands has been carried off -- even the old tin cans, and the
     place would not be noticed unless you knew where is was. The
     Coast and Geodetic survey had a marker near my house in the front
     yard and even that is gone; who would want to take a concrete
     marker and carry it away?

     "...after two weeks, you can hear insects running on the ground,
     (also) forest fires will not burn there. They burnt 250,000
     acres, then burnt all around this area; and that stopped the
     forest rangers. They never could understand because most of it is
     on the slope of a mountain and it should have gone, but they saw
     that the wind came down and blew from the top down and blew
     North, South, East and West at once and that was the only time
     that the wind ever blew there.

     "Also you can detect an ATMOSPHERE of FEAR within 30 miles of the
     area and you will not get a statement from anyone who lives
     around there and the people in the valleys are afraid of the
     people in the hills. One farmer erected 20 foot barbed wire
     fences and a heavy gate across the road that leads to my old
     place. The gate would take a tank to knock down, so maybe there
     is something there, after all. (Note: Richard Toronto reprinted a
     news article in his SHAVERTRON newsletter concerning a Krishna
     Sect temple that had been built on a mountain BETWEEN Hopland and
     Lakeport, California -- the same area that Edward John refers to.
     This sect had come under Federal scrutiny when it was discovered
     that they had been stockpiling weapons for some unknown purpose.
     Interesting... - Branton)

     "It is located 110 miles north of San Francisco in Mendocino
     county and is directly on the old Pieta toll road that ran
     between Hopland and Lakeport in Lake county of which Clear Lake
     is quite a summer resort. If you care to look it up on a map get
     a good auto road map and look due south off the road midway
     between towns and you will note an area with no roads bounded by
     Sonoma Lake and lower Mendocino counties and there is it. If you
     wish to go there, be sure that enough people know where you went.
     Maybe they will be able to find you. There have been several
     disappearances along that stretch of road, even trucks have
     vanished. All the U.S. Government's.

     "The U.S. Government has noted the area as rough, unsurveyable
     and UNEXPLORED...

     "Personally I do not care to go near the place, but if there is
     some way of driving the things out I would help if I can so that
     someone else could live there safely.

     "...Also I forgot to mention there is a cave on the property that
     has steps leading down and there is no sound when a rock is
     thrown in. I have never seen it, but I understand that it is
     there... Also, several people (in the area) have died of heart
     failure and some have gone insane, I found out later.

     "I think the thing that saved us was the fact that I am not
     surprised at anything and that I am quick to shoot and I can
     shoot without sighting and by ear and not having the THOUGHT of
     shooting fixed SO THAT the things would be warned. After that
     place, I was able to outshoot U.S. Marine sharpshooters. I tried
     competing in a match and I just never missed any target at any
     range. If I could see it, I could hit it, 5 out of 5. I have
     tried practice machine guns at plane models and I hit 3 out of 5
     at speeds up to 700 mph scale without using the sights. So the
     old ranch gave me something worthwhile after all.

     "Due to my physical condition, I cannot get into any armed
     forces, so that talent is wasted, for you see I have a bad leg
     and cannot walk more than a mile at a time. Since I left the
     ranch I have been in the radio business and have not owned a gun
     since '34, because as long as I stay away from there I don't need
     one..."

An interesting post-script to this story. Several years following this
incident, some people who had befriended Edward John stated that he claimed
to know of an man who was not from this planet. He was a radio expert in
the Navy and, according to Mr. John, he was born on a world with no
temperate zone but where the tropics and the arctic regions were almost
adjacent to each other. Still later, others made references to Mr. John as
having actually met up with the 'space brothers', essentially becoming
another 'contactee' like those who frequented California during the late
1950's and early 1960's.

Aside from the area referred to by Edward John, there are apparently other
"danger zones" in different parts of the world that have been associated
with underground phenomena. The 'I.N.F.O. JOURNAL' (box 367., Arlington,
VA, 22210), a publication devoted to 'Fortean' research, in it's Vol. IV,
No. 2 issue related one of the most frightening and disturbing accounts of
subterranean abduction that we have come across yet. The article, titled
'MOUNTAIN OF DEATH', was written by David D. Browne, and originally
appeared in the June 1972 issue of WALKABOUT, published in Sydney,
Australia:

     "Black Mountain comes almost as a shock when you see it first.

     "Traveling by bus just south of Cooktown, North Queensland
     (Australia), a bend in the road suddenly discloses it and the
     visual impact can bring an involuntary exclamation, as you see it
     -- black, bare and sinister, a 1,000 ft. high pile of enormous
     boulders two miles long, rearing out of the rain-forest.

     "This is 'the Mountain of Death.' Aborigines will not go near it.
     An ancient legend warns them of danger. White men fear it too,
     because of the numbers of men who have gone there and disappeared
     without a trace, as if the earth -- or the mountain -- had
     swallowed them. Birds and animals shun the area.

     "The rocks give off a curious metallic ring when struck, and the
     only sound is the croaking of countless frogs sheltered in the
     depths where the great granite boulders lie against each other.

     "In Brisbane's Public Library, a yellowing newspaper cutting
     tells some of the story:

     "'Grim tragedy has been associated with the mountain ever since
     it has been known to white man.

     "'Three men with horses completely disappeared at the mountain.
     They vanished as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up,
     for absolutely no trace of them has ever been discovered,
     although police and backtrackers and hundreds of local residents
     scoured the mountain and surrounding country.'

     "Then following (were) the names and occupations of several
     others who disappeared, and the dates of their disappearance. The
     cutting continues:

     "'This constitutes one of the most amazing stories in the police
     history of the far north, for not one of the mysteries has been
     solved and probably never will be.'

     "Another newspaper cutting, signed Nancy Francis, reads:

     "'The formation of these mountains is unique; their appearance
     grotesque. They are mountains of huge boulders full of chasms
     that go down to unsounded depths. Only a few rock wallabies and a
     few turkeys live near these grim, forbidding hills. The
     Aborigines regard the Black Mountains with dread.'

     "In the files of the Cooktown police, dating back 25 years, there
     is a report made by a Sergeant of Police who discussed the
     mountain with a man whom he refers to as Mac. Mac began:

     "'Know anything about Black Mountain, or so-called 'Mountain of
     Death'? Its aboriginal name is Kalcajagga.'

     "'What does it look like at close quarters?' I asked.

     "'Just a mass of tumbled granite blocks; hardly any vegetation.
     The only living things there are black rock wallabies and
     enormous pythons 16 feet or more long and able to swallow a
     wallaby whole. The ridge is honeycombed with caves, nearly all
     unexplored. They dip down below ground level but nobody knows
     their extent or what they contain.'

     "The latest fatalities, he reported, had occurred only a few
     years earlier when two young men set out to solve the riddle of
     earlier disappearances in the caves. They were never heard of
     again. Two black trackers who tried to trace them disappeared
     too.

     "Then Mac went back to the beginning of the mountain's grim
     story.

     "The first-known fatality was that of a carrier named Grayner, in
     1977. He had been searching on horseback for strayed bullocks
     when he, with his horse and bullocks, vanished without a trace.
     Thirteen years later, Constable Ryan, stationed at Cooktown,
     tracked a 'wanted' man to the scrub at the foot of the mountain.
     Other trackers followed his trail to the entrance of one of the
     caves, but he was never seen again. Nor was the 'wanted' man.

     "More recently a gold prospector named Renn was added to the list
     of mysterious disappearances.

     "Well-organized police teams with trackers combed the whole area
     for weeks without finding him.

     "Then there was the case of Harry Owens, a station owner from
     Oakley Creek. One Sunday morning he rode over towards Black
     Mountain looking for strayed cattle. When he didn't return on
     time his partner, George Hawkins, alerted the police then went
     out to look for him himself. But by the time the police joined in
     the search, Hawkins had also disappeared. Two of the native
     police trackers entered one of the caves. ONLY ONE OF THEM CAME
     OUT. He was so unnerved by what seemed to have been an experience
     of terror that he could give no clear account of what happened to
     them both.

     "Mac even knew a white men who had penetrated the caves and lived
     to tell the tale, and produced a newspaper cutting of his story.
     It read:

     "'Armed with a revolver and a strong electric torch I stepped
     into the opening. Like other Black Mountain caverns it dipped
     steeply downwards, narrowing as it went.

     "'Suddenly I found myself facing a solid wall of rock, but to the
     right there was a passageway just large enough for me to enter in
     a stooping position. I moved along it carefully for several
     yards. The floor was fairly level, the walls of very smooth
     granite. The passage twisted this way and that, always sloping
     deeper into the earth.

     "'Presently I began to feel uneasy. A huge bat beat its wings
     against me as it passed, but I forced myself to push on. Soon my
     nostrils were filled WITH A SICKLY, MUSTY STENCH. THEN MY TORCH
     WENT OUT.

     "'I was in total darkness. It was inky black. From somewhere that
     seemed like the bowels of the earth I could hear faint moaning of
     bats.

     "'I began to get panicky and I groped and floundered back the way
     I thought I had come. My arms and legs bleeding from bumps with
     unseen rocks. My outstretched hands clawed at space where I
     expected solid wall and floor. At one stage where I wandered into
     a side passage I came to what was undoubtedly the brink of a
     precipice, judging by the echoes.

     "'The air was FOUL and I felt increasing DIZZINESS.

     "'Terrifying thoughts were racing through my mind about giant
     rock pythons I have often seen around Black Mountain.

     "'As I crawled along, getting weaker and losing all hope of ever
     getting out alive, I saw a tiny streak of light. It gave me super
     strength to worm my way towards a small cave mouth half a mile
     from the one I had entered.

     "'Reaching the open air, I gulped in lungfulls of it and fell
     down exhausted.

     "'I found I had been underground for five hours, most of the time
     on my hands and knees. A king's ransom would not induce me to
     enter those caves again...'

     "Such are some of the weird stories told of the mountain.

     "These and the extraordinary structure of the mountain itself
     give rise to many questions, scientific and otherwise.

     "On the scientific aspect, the following comments come from a
     member of the staff of the James Cook University of North
     Queensland, Dept. of Geology, Associate Professor P.J.
     Stephenson.

     "He says, 'I have visited and climbed the mountain concerned. It
     is composed of huge granite boulders covered with black lichen.
     The complete black surface coating may be uncommon but the
     boulder pile is less so. Near Chillagoe and at several other
     localities in north Queensland similar phenomena exist.

     "'The occurrences are somewhat puzzling because of their relative
     rarity. However, they must have been produced by rapid erosion of
     the 'skeletal' soil profile. Many soil profiles contain fresh
     rock 'kernels' in them and removal of the soil component would
     produce a boulder pile. But such removal takes place so slowly
     the 'kernels' also weather completely...'

     "There are still some practical questions to ask, however.

     "What really did happen to those people who at various times in
     the last hundred years, have been said to disappear, vanish
     without a trace?

     "...Any party that decides to unravel the mystery of the mountain
     will need to be very carefully organized and equipped to meet any
     hazard, likely or unlikely -- not forgetting the possibility of
     meeting a very real python. CR: Simpson."

"In his detailed report on the Maury Island UFO (incident) of 1947, Kenneth
Arnold also describes meeting a small, dark foreign looking man who was
tinkering with the motor on a beat-up boat in TACOMA HARBOR. Ray Palmer,
editor of 'AMAZING STORIES' in Chicago, had commissioned Arnold to
investigate the puzzling Maury Island affair, which began when a
'donut-shaped object' (according to other sources, one of six such craft
seen at the time - Branton) had rained 'slag' onto a boat near Maury
Island. Pieces of that slag had killed a dog aboard the boat and slightly
injured a boy, the son of Harold Dahl, who was piloting it. Early the next
morning, according to Dahl's story, a 1947 Buick drove up to his home and a
black-suited man of medium height visited him. This man, Dahl said, recited
in detail everything that had happened the day before AS IF HE HAD BEEN
THERE. Then he warned Dahl not to discuss his sighting to anyone, hinting
that if he did there might be unpleasant repercussions which would affect
him and his family. Since Dahl and the others had not yet told anyone of
their sighting, and since UFOs were still publicly unknown (Arnold's
sighting over Mount Rainier and the attendant publicity did not occur until
three days later), Dahl was naturally nonplused by his strange visitor.
This was the first modern MIB report (although Edward John might
disagree... - Branton).
