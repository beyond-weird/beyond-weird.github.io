                               The OMEGA File
                                INTRODUCTION

     If, as the late J. Allen Hynek claimed, over 1 in 40 people have been
     abducted and 'processed' by the 'alien/secret government' agenda -- or
     1 in 10 according to more recent sources -- then you are bound to know
     SOMEONE who is an abductee and KNOWS it. This information is for THEM.
     For those who are not "UFO Abductees", the information in this file is
     nevertheless vital and applicable, and may one day save your life!!!
     If you believe that information about "Aliens" is only for those who
     have lost all touch with reality, then PLEASE accept that information
     in this document that you CAN accept, and pass over the rest, at least
     for now. Your future may depend on it. As I have said, this
     information may save your life. This file contains the most intricate
     and intimate details of a global conspiracy which seems to be rooted
     in an alien - military - industrial collaboration which is intent on
     bringing all freedom-loving peoples of this world under its control,
     through the implimentation of a global government which has commonly
     been referred to as the 'New World Order'. We have pulled no punches
     and are laying everything out on the table in regards to the New World
     Order agenda as I and those who have contributed to this document
     perceive it. If you are one who is easily offended, then be warned.
     Most of you who read this will realize that you may have personally
     supported in one form or another -- albeit unknowingly -- certain
     religious, economic, or political organizations which are on various
     levels being controlled by those forces that are working towards the
     implementation of the New World Order. Those who have contributed to
     this file have not compromised nor held back on what they perceive to
     be the truth in regards to this conspiracy.



     We make no apologies, since we feel that this agenda has already been
     responsible for damaging this American Republic in ways that most
     cannot even begin to comprehend, and will continue to be a threat to
     its very existence and prosperity until this 'enemy' is forever purged
     from our nation and those traitors responsible for violating our
     national security and 'selling out' this Constitutional Republic of
     the United States of America are brought to justice. Consider this a
     declaration of WAR against those eco-political forces and their
     draconian backers who would destroy our prosperity and freedom for
     their own fleeting material gain. So with no further introduction, we
     repeat the words of Louisiana District Attorney and JFK assassination
     investigator James Garrison, who boldly stated before leaving this
     world... "LET THE TRUTH BE TOLD, THOUGH THE HEAVENS FALL!"]
