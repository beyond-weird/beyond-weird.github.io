           Crop Circle Update - FIELD OF SCHEMES I
                       By Bill Eatwell

In the November 1992 issue of the Mufon UFO Journal, there
is an article by Jim Schnabel titled, "Confessions Of A Crop
Circle Spy". Well, as always, there is more to this story
than is being published. For one thing, there are alleged
inaccuracies in Schnabel's telling of his side of an
a recorded telephone interview that was to be published in
the journal of the Centre For Crop Circle Studies known as
The Circular which is edited by George Wingfield. The
interview was mysteriously pulled from the magazine before
distribution.

In October, while attending George Wingfield's Dallas, Texas
lecture (see HUFON Report, Nov., 1992 issue), George gave
me, in strict confidence, a copy of the Schnabel interview
that had been pulled.  George told me that his publisher in
England, Michael Green, had pulled the interview from
publication while he was on his lecture tour here in
America.
I was told to "sit" on my copy unless given the go ahead to
publish the suppressed interview in the HUFON Report if
George was unable to resolve the problem when he returned to
England.  On Saturday,(12/5) I received a call from a friend
alerting me that a new publication in Dallas, the Texas
Mufon Newsletter, had just published George's suppressed
interview.
I immediately called George in England and asked permission
to reprint the same article in  HUFON Report.  I not only
got the OK, but received the next day, by fax a copy of
George's soon to be published reply to the above Journal
article by Schnabel.  Since not all HUFON members subscribe
to the Mufon UFO Journal, I will carefully summarize
Schnabel's article below. Included in this Crop Circle
Update are both the suppressed interview, and George's faxed
reply to Schnabel's article which should appear in the
December Mufon UFO Journal. According to George, the
following (suppressed) interview was made and recorded by
Dr. Armen Victorian (AKA: Henry Azadehdel, Dr. Alan Jones,
and for this interview, Cassava Ntumba). George says that
there was no time lapse between Victorian's prior call to a
Robert Irving, and Jim Schnabel.  Why is this important?
Because, Schnabel claims that Irving called him to warn of
Victorian's question line and the two of them conspired to
lead Victorian, as Ntumba, down the old proverbial false
disinformation trail.
George also told me that someone (he knows who) sent a copy
of the "pulled" interview to Schnabel so he could fashion a
quick cover story and, somehow, persuade the Mufon UFO
Journal to print it.  After you have read the following, I
will have more at the end.....


THE SUPPRESSED CIRCULAR INTERVIEW
Subject of The Circular interview in this issue is Jim
Schnabel.   He has written several newspaper articles on the
circles beginning with an item in the Washington Post last
year which espoused the cause of orthodox Meadenism. More
recently he collaborated with Robert Irving to produce a
piece for the Independent Magazine in which it was implied
that many of the major pictograms in the mid-Wiltshire area
were hoaxed by the UBI group.  Although UBI has faked a few
minor formations (of which CCCS has full details)
suggestions of major hoaxing by them --at, say, Alton
Barnes--are known to be untrue and this article can only be
seen as part of Schnabel and Irving's campaign to make
people think that the pictograms are all hoaxes and promote
the highly dubious claims of Doug & Dave.

Unlike Doug & Dave, Schnabel is an accomplished circlefaker
and in July he came second in The Cerealogist's Circlemaking
Competition at West described then as the "Master of
Grapeshot," he did not deny having had previous circlemaking
experience.

Ostensibly Schnabel is a student doing a post-graduate
course in sociology at Bath University. Despite this his
telephone number is on the Oxford exchange and his address
in Bath (where Robert Irving lives) is secret.  He usually
gives his address as c/o Lincoln College, Oxford, although
at the beginning of l992 Lincoln College stated that
Schnabel no longer had any connection with them.

@MSGID: 1:123/26 0e924993
In the following candid interview Schnabel reveals his role
as a paid disinformation agent working for an unnamed
western inrelligence organisation.  From what he says, one
is made aware of the extent and determination of the
continuing campaign to rubbish the circles and discredit the
researchers. This campaign is but a continuation of the Doug
& Dave scam with different faces, different players.

The "interviewer" in this case is Armen Victorian, who has
written for The Circular previously and who introduces
himself as Kasaba Ntumba.  Unaware of Ntumba's true
identity, Schnabel gradually opens up to this apparently
sympnthetic caller.

It is only fair to say that Schnabel now denies everything
which is contained herein and telephoned me some days later
in a state of scarcely suppressed agitation to claim that he
had just been ~winding up ~ Victorian (whom he had never met
or talked to, apart from a very brief introductory phone
call a short while before on the same day). Readers of The
Circular will have to judge for themselves whether or not
this is the case.

One may justifiably ask why someone would ever reveal well-
hidden secrets to a total stranger at such short notice. I
can only say that Victorian has achieved similar coups time
and again in speaking, by telephone to top intelligence
officers in the U.S.A., in South Africa and in other
countries and these people have frequently regretted what
they have let slip.  If Schnabel had been "winding up"
Victorian, it is inconceivable that he would then ring me up
and come clean. Apart from anything else he never normally
calls me, and of all the hoaxes I 've known --not just
circular ones-- no hoaxer has ever once sprung forward
saying "it's all a hoax, don't believe a word I just said."
Double bluff? Well, if you believe that, you'll believe
anything !

The acid test, of course, is the tape recording itself
rather than the transcript. Listen to this and, as with the
recent "Dianagate" tapes, one soon discards the notion that
the responses are contrived or false. It is to be regretted
that information has been obtained in this way but in the
face of a ruthless and sustained campaign to deceive the
public and CCCS this is amply justified.

For people who scoff at the idea that intelligence agencies
have any interests  in the circles phenomerlon, I can only
say that when in Washington, D. C., last April I was taken
specifically tomeet four charming gentlemen from the CIA who
made no secret about their profession and also their
interest in the circles and the UFO phenomenon. This is
entirely consistent with the content of this interview.

Sch: Hello.
Vic: Mr Schnabel?
Sch: Yes.
Vic: This is Mr Ntumba.
Sch: Oh, hi. Hallo.
Vic: I'm sorry to bother you at Ihis time of the night. I
     was...now then, I was speaking to your friend.
Sch: Sorry?
Vic: I was, I was speaking to your friend a few hours ago,
     Mr Robert Irving.
Sch: Oh yeah, Rob Irving, yeah.
Vic: Thal's right; and I understand that you won the second
     prize in proving that, eventually, these, eh, circles
     are not reaily what the others think are made by 7-feet
     green men. And they are very much in an earth bound
     situation.
Sch: Yes, yes, I wouldn't have to prove anything really.
Vic: My congratulations - [laughs] - you did a good job.
Sch: Thank you very much, thank you very much.
Vic: Have you published anything?
Sch: Yes, eh, I have published a few things....
Vic: In magazines or newspapers - or private or..   ?
Sch: Well, yeah, I published something just this past
     weekend.
Vic: Ah!
Sch: In the Independent Magazine - that was a collaboration
     with....
Vic: Hey! You have an American accent!
Sch: Sorry?
Vic: You have an American accent.
Sch: Yes, I'm originally from the States, that's true.
Vic: Which part?
Sch: I'm from the East Coast.
Vic: East Coast. New York part?
Sch: In Virginia.
Vic: Virginia, a beautiful part of the country.
Sch: Yes it is, thank you very much.
Vic: Beautiful part of the country. One thing. . . One thing
     that Mr Irving said to me that I was a bit puzzled. He
     said that he works at a group of intelligence . . ., or
     something like that.
Sch: Oh, he did?
Vic: He did.
Sch: [Laughs] He, um...
Vic: When?
Sch: He sometimes, eh. . ., says things that he shouldn't
     say, but, eh...
Vic: What? Did he work genuinely with an intelligence...
Sch: Sorry - say that again.
Vic: Did he actually work with intelligence in the past?
Sch: Well, I really couldn't comment on anything like that.
     I mean I think you'd have to ask him.
Vic: ' Cos he was saying to me that - you know...What did he
     say to me?...  It was something that mystified me, to
     be perfectly honest with you. Eh, you know, he said
     that it pays, you know, that exactly what, you know, he
     said to me, to do what he is doing, and he works with a
     western intelligence... , he said to me.
Sch: Yeah.
Vic: And he said that man doesn't live on bread alone.
Sch: Yeah, well, you know, I really couldn't comment on any
     of that, I mean, ...eh....
Vic: Do you know, if that's the case that he is actually
     working with.. ?
Sch: Well, I wouldn't want to say anything on the record
     obviously.
Vic: [Laughs.] Well I don't blame you, can I? But I mean is
     he. .?  What I'm trying to say is you know....Look,
     you've handled these cases for several....sometimes
     people say things, as you've said yourself.  Is it
     saying it in order to create credence and mystery or
     you know this....?  because if it is the case, it
     backfires doesn't it, because that makes the man...you
     know what I'm trying to say.
Sch: No, I'm not clear
Vic: All I'm saying is....if that's not the case, the man
     doesn't work,.so why is he making all this, you
     know...statements, you see what I'm saying, it makes
     him look, you know, a person who doesn't have any
     credit in his opinion - do you see what I'm trying to
     say?

Sch: Well....
Vic: It's like me saying I'm the king.....
Sch: Well, I don't know....
Vic: Well, it's like me claiming....
Sch: I don't know what he has said but I mean he does have
     some connections in....l don't know, but I don't think
     thats something that either of us want to talk about.
Vic: But you know - there is a story...
Sch: I don't quite know who you are, so I don't want to talk
     about it in too much detail.
Vic: No, but I've been reading some of these magazines they
     have issued about groups and these articles about the
     7-feet green men... groups put out that's there's
     intelligence in it, etc., etc., and now Mr Irving says
     that to me. You see I was a bit taken back. Is there
     any interest from the intelligence ,part in it as well?
Sch: Sorry, intelligence....?
Vic: Any interest from the intelligence part in the
     phenomenon?
Sch: Well, does he have an interest in the intelligence? ...
     I'm not sure quite what...
Vic: What I'm trying to tell.... it's my bad English, I'm
     sorry.
Sch: About M15, or are you talking about UFOs?
Vic: Anything...any government intelligence group....
Sch: No, no, it's clear to me now. Yes, well I mean....off
     the record, I mean I think a number of agencies
     throughout the world have taken an interest in this.
Vic: Well, that we've heard, haven't we?
Sch: It is potentially a very explosine phenomenon.
Vic: I mean, can they exploit it, how can they exploit the
     phenomenon?
Sch: Well, I mean, I think...l think some of us are
     concerned that the phenomenon may - it's difficult to
     explain, but....
Vic: Try me!
Sch: We believe there is certainly something very sinister
     about what's going on - eh..., I don't know whether
     you're a Christian man or not....?
Vic:    Christian... of course I am.
Sch: But some of us feel quite....
Vic: I'm a Catholic.
Sch: Well, yes, yes, so am I. And some of us feel concerned
     that, eh....
Vic: Some arms of the government are doing something...
     psychological warfare, or psychotronic weaponry, you
     know.
Sch: We think that sometimes that a little bit of intrigue .
     . sometimes is necessary in cases as serious as this,
     um, and sometimes measures have to be taken, but I
     think, I mean, overall, I think that the phenomenon is
     something which we think will disappear very shortly.
Vic: [Bated breath!!] How, how, how, how, how, how? I mean,
     I'm sorry, but I'm  just curious - it's mind-boggling
     what you're saying!  But how, how do you know that will
     happen?
Sch: [Sigh] Well, we think that it, that people will no
     longer take notice of it, I mean, it may continue but,
     eh, it....
Vic: But why do you say phenomenon? You proved that this is
     man-made, if it's a man-made... how could it be a
     phenomena?  Or am I in the dark, or I've missed
     something somewhere?
Sch: Well, I'm, I'm, I think some of them are definitely
     man-made; I mean definately.
Vic: But, so, but so, we are suggesting that there's also a
     part to it that is genuine?
Sch: I think there is a part which is entirely sinister and
     I'm not sure how genuine it is or whether it's made by
     people but it's something very sinister and I think
     it's something that....
Vic: Are we talking about mugic, dark powers?
Sch: Possibly, yes.. and I think that it...hang on, I'm
     getting a bit. . .
Vic: It' s intriguing, when we say dark powers arewe talking
     about...  sort of Satan and that sort of thing, or are
     we talking about actually....?
Sch: AbsolutelY!
Vic: I see, I see, so there isn't any sort of military
     implication or the test of, of weaponry or anything of
     that sort, which is sinister?
Sch: Oh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that..    l think it's a
     very complex issue though.......
Vic: Are we talking about the part of the military wing
     who's under the brainwashing, or whatever, of the
     sinister forces who are doing this - you know, making
     it a bit more complex?
Sch: Well, well it's very  difficult to explain to vou -
     to explain the structure of some of these
     organisations, but......

Vic: For example? Give me an example.
Sch: Why? I couldn't go into detail but, eh, basically
     it's something which is concerning people worldwide
     and have pooled their resources, worldwide, and are
     involved.....
Vic: How about the British Government? Are they also... ?
Sch: Well, yes. The German Government, the American
     government, the Vatican as well.
Vic: How about Robert? Does Robert have anything with any of
     this to help them along with it, to determine what is
     going on?
Sch: I wouldn't want to comment on the record or anything
     like that.
Vic: Of course not.
Sch: Definitely, you know....as you seem to be sympathetic
     to what we're  saying.....
Vic: Of course! What you're saying makes me worried.
     He is definitely on the good side
Sch: He is.... he is one of our best people, yes.
Vic: And he's helping the governments to determine which
     faction is doing this?
Sch: Yes, it's very... extremely sensitive, sensitive work
     as you can probably imagine.....
Vic: Is it...eh...now, let's see, are we talking about
     military, or are we talking about intelligence, are we
     talking about the negative side, you see what I ' m
     trying to say?
Sch: It's not quite a military thing but there are elements
     of military intelligence which have loaned resources.
Vic. Ahhhh! ! We are talking about people who have had a
     career, they've left their career, they have
     corporations, etc., etc., they are developing some kind
     of weaponry and these are the testing ground.
Sch: No, no, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go into that, it's
     much more of a spiritual warfare type of magic, I
     think....
Vic: And they trying to exploit the populus, I mean, what
     are they trying to achieve? This is what I'm trying to
     determine.
Sch: I think they are trying to bring about changes in world
     consciousness and for evil; for, for, you know, not for
     good and, eh, there are some of us who are concerned
     about this, and would like to see this new trend
     stopped.
Vic: Is there any positive element in the government
     who are supporting people like yourself or Robert or
     anybody else for that mattter?
Sch: We have support, yes, we have support at the highest
     levels.
Vic: That's marvelous -is it British government ....or...
     forgive me, I'm not trying to be a nosy parker.
Sch: It involves several countries and as I say.....
Vic: Are we talking NATO allies or are we talking
     about...........    ?  Sch: NATO ?...it's not at the
     NATO level, but it's Germany involved, and this
     country, and the United States...  the Vatican as well.
Vic: I see...I...   are we talking about...?
Sch: It's actually, it in volves a supernational
     organisation which I will not name.
Vic: [Gasp]Supernational !!!
Sch: Supernational organisation.
Vic: Oh, good God !
Sch: Which is....?
Vic. This is above my head.
Sch: Which has ties to these countries, and organisations.
Vic: Are we talking, for example trilateral, that sort
     of thing?
Sch: I wouldn't want to get into any specifics.
Vic: Do you have any information...'? I'm speculating...
Sch: It's something that is very dangerous to talk about,
     and I hope, you will, you know...
Vic: I appreciate it, I appreciate it...I mean, is it a
     mission that you volunteered or is it something that
     you actually commission people ....I mean how do
     they...?
Sch: It's...we are quite committed to it,
     put it that way. It's not a sense of duty but it's
     also.....
Vic: How about the other religions, does  that come into it
     or is it only Christian religion or just Christians
     committed to it? eh, I mean Buddhism, or Judaism or
     Islam .... you know?
Sch: I don't have a high enough overview of the whole
     situation to know. There may be some others involved.
Vic: And the information that you gather is passed on to the
     higher-ups in order to  be filtered out and deductions
     have to be taken, obviously; that should be the case?
Sch: Yes, yes..     we are not just feeding information, we
     are taking active measures.
Vic: I hope they pay for what you've done, for the time and
     all the things that you put in to it.
Sch: Well, yes...it's only natural that one should be
     reimbursed.
Vic: That goes without saying.
Sch: One has to live, you know.
Vic: That is absolutely true. How many are there? Is there
     any way I can get, sort of, you know, involved?
Sch: Well, I'll tell you, if you can, um, give me some
     information, I understand you would probably want to do
     it on a very confidential level... some information
     or...I could have someone possibly give you a call or
     visit you or something.

Vic: OK, of course.

[ Very long pause ensues]

Sch: Yes, right.
Vic: Is it better?
Sch: Yes.
Vic: OK. You remember last time when we were speaking you
     said that, you know, ******* has been a good source
     with regard to promoting the cause.
Sch: Yes, yes.
Vic: I remember that when ******* came here there was also
     another person.
Sch: Yes.
Vic: Do you know who he was?
Sch: His name is #####.
Vic: Ahhhh! He was very quiet. Is he also working in the
     same way?
Sch: I wouldn't want to speak about further things, I mean
     it's extremely sensitive, I really shouldn't have told
     you all that I've told you already...and unfortunately
     at the moment I'm quite busy with some things, but um,
     do send the material and perhaps... l'll tell you
     here's um, a ...I'm trying to think.  Will you ...
     [massive hesitation]l...oh, no, no, if you send the
     material to Lincoln College;   send some indication of
     where you can be reached.
Vic: O.K.
Sch: We can discuss things further, someone else will
     contact you, and eh, it won't be me, it will be a much
     more senior person in the organisation and then
     subsequently, eh, you know, if things work out well and
     more information can be shared with you.
Vic: The reason that I mentioned about that gentleman ...
     because he was talking almost on a similar line, you
     know, that you were talking in many ways... do you see
     what I'm saying?
Sch: I really couldn't comment further on him, I wouldn't
     want to compromise his position.
Vic: I see ! Well, I hope that, you know...that the mission
     will be acomplished and that, you know, after all this
     time.  Has there been any good witness.. ?
Sch: We have no doubt of success.
Vic: Well I'm delighted to hear that.  Now, about the
     payment. How do we claim for the expenses, etc., you
     know, how do we go about this usually?  I mean, how do
     you go about that?

Vic: Is it on a monthly basis?
Sch: If you are found to be a suitable candidate -- it's
     extremely generous, don't worry about that.
Vic: OK. You know there is a great deal of travelling
     backward and forward, you know, as you are involved in
     this...
Sch: You will be expected to travel internationally.
Vic: Oh, what .... that's fascinating, that is absolutely

The following summary of "Confession Of A Crop Circle Spy"
by James Schnabel is very brief as the original document in
the November 1992 Mufon UFO Journal is five pages long.
Dennis Stacy, the Journal's Editor, begins the article with
a half page introduction. Stacy's comments center around the
thought process regarding both UFO's and crop circles and
how they are perceived and possible related. Also, he notes
the lessons to be learned when hoaxing, fear of government
agents and conspiracies and, as this article painfully
illuminates, a wide spread paranoia begins to grip all those
individuals who are intimately, and publicly, involved with
both phenomena.

( Note that James Schnabel, by himself, won 2nd prize in the
circle making competition in England, at West Wycome, July
11-12, 1992...He also wrote an article on "The Art of
Circular Science" for The Cerealogist, No.  7, Harvest 1992,
which will be available from the HUFON library in Jan.  93.)

@MSGID: 1:123/26 0e924999
James Schnabel begins his article by describing numerous
unnamed crop circle researchers as "vociferous spycriers".
The story that follows is what Schnabel claims happened when
in a light-hearted moment he suggested to an inquirer,
"Cassave Ntumba", that "yes, it was all true, he was indeed
a spy". The phone interviews actually began with Ntumba
calling Rob Irving, a photographer who had worked with
Schnabel on a London newspaper article about one of the
circle-making groups active in Wiltshire. Schnabel says that
Irving recognized Ntumba as Henry Azadehdel, recalling Henry
as the person who authored a story last year about Doug
Bower and Dave Chorley being spies.(remember the Doug and
Dave scam?) Irving reportedly recorded the conversation, and
immediately afterwards called Schnabel and a "spy-chase"
plan was conceived. There were several lengthy phone
conversations between Irving and Ntumba, and Schnabel and
Ntumba. Schnabel summarizes most of these but adds something
to the first conversation that I could not find in the
suppressed interview.  The "Plan", as Schnabel outlines to
Ntumba, "was meant (a) to divert attention from the ultra-
secret Stars Wars weapons testing which caused the circles".
Unless I missed something, this was not in the original text
of the Circular Interview.  As Schnabel unfolds his story,
he begins using single letter references to various
individuals leaving the reader to only "guess" as to their
identity. One example is: "So I telephoned W and asked him
to relay to the elusive zadehdel that the whole thing had
been a send up. I hope-I said-that you have enough sense of
humor to see that this was all done in fun. To which W
responded: well I'm not sure I do, Jim.  I mean, I wouldn't
be in the lease bit surprised if you were a spy". Other
lettered identities in the story are: R, E, G, F, T, D, U, M
and G, C and his good friend B.  The "Plan", as Schnabel
calls it, received much notoriety following the Ntumba
interview.  The worst unmasking according to Schnabel
occurred at the UFO meet at the Leeds Civic Theater, in
England, where Armen Victorian (aka: Ntumba) was to present
taped conversations of international debunkers.  The taped
interview between Victorian and Schnabel was played causing
a confrontation in which Schnabel says he attempted to
convince the audience that it had all been a put-on, a sham.
Schnabel narrates only a portion of the recording in his
story. When I compared the two recorded conversations, some
sentences were not word for word. This indicates editing by
one or the other writer.  Nothing important appeared missing
in the two recorded dialogs.  The story ends with Schnabel
stating his personal feelings of the events, his believed
vindication, and his relief that W's article had been pulled
from the printers, and the article detailing The Plan
removed. However, Irving and Schnabel believe that there
still remains a "hint of unsolved mystery" to their acts as
one question still remains with the cerealogists: "How had
we known so much?"


As you can tell, the crop circle hoaxing issue is about to
come to a nasty head. Personally, I believe that there needs
to be more articles published on those persons doing valid
crop circle research and less on those interfering with the
phenomenon.

I spoke with our new contributor, Rosemary Ellen Guiley and
discovered that she had moved again. A copy of her Center's
report will be sent to me as soon as it is completed.
Meanwhile, Rosemary faxed the following comments for our
latest column.  Her new address, phone and fax numbers are
included for publication per her request.

Center For North American Crop Circle Studies
Director: Rosemary Ellen Guiley
Address: P.O. Box 4766, Lutherville, MD 21094
Phone: 410-628-1522 / Fax: 410-628-1524

December 7, 1992

Rosemary writes:
Far too much attention was devoted this summer in crop
circle circles to allegations concerning disinformation,
conspiracy and hoaxing. Individuals alleged to be the
masterminds of a plot to debunk circles were given more
credit than they deserved by noise made by some
cereologists. The unfortunate result was to shift attention
away from solving the mystery of the phenomenon to focus on
personalities and name calling.

As for the circles themselves, in England they manifested in
as mysterious shapes as before, with the signature of
Goddess stronger than ever: snails, crescent moons, the knot
of Isis (resembling and alpha) and the mu-at, a dumbbell
with crescent that is also a sign of Isis. Overall, the
activity was more low-key than the previous year, with the
media paying scant attention to anything beyond the hoaxing
contest done in July for the amusement of humans.

In the U.S., reported activity also was less that last year,
though reports continue to trickle in to the Center for
North American Crop Circle Studies (CNACCS). Illinois was
once again one of the more active states. The most dramatic
formation was a dumbbell in alfalfa near Fergus Falls,
Minnesota. More detailed reports will be available soon from
CNACCS and the North American Institute for Crop Circle
Research in Winnepeg.

In closing, one final comment. An unusual bit of movement
has occurred with two of the original English crop circle
researchers. It is being called the "grain drain" by
Rosemary Ellen Guiley. Seems that both Colin Andrews and
Richard Andrews (no relation) have moved their crop circle
business to America. Do they know something no one else
knows?

Stay tuned.
