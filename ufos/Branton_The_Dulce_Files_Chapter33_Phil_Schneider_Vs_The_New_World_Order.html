PHIL SCHNEIDER VS. THE NEW WORLD ORDER





[The following article was downloaded from the INTERNET...]



Underground Bases: A Lecture by Phil Schneider: May 1995
=====================================



Phil Schneider, a very brave man, recently lost his life due to what
appeared to be a military-style execution in January 1996. He was found
dead in his apartment with piano wire still wrapped around his neck.
According to some sources, he had been brutally tortured repeated before
being killed. Phil Schneider was an ex-government engineer who was involved
in building

underground bases. He was one of three people to survive the 1979 fire
fight between the large Greys and U.S. intelligence and military forces at
Dulce underground base. (Actually, one of several firefights, according to
other sources. A man by the name of L. Anderson of Denver, has informed
this writer that the survivors of the Dulce wars were taken and placed
together in groups of three and told that they were the only survivors of
the conflict. Apparently this was done to maintain more control over these
personnel and prevent potential leaks of information. - Branton)

In May 1995, Phil Schneider did a lecture on what he had discovered. Seven
months later he was tortured and killed by those for whom he had previously
worked. This man's final acts should not go unnoticed.

"It is because of the horrendous structure of the federal government that I
feel directly imperiled *not* to tell anybody about this material. How long
I will be able to do this is anybody's guess. However, I would like to
mention that this talk is going to be broken up into four main topics. Each
of these topics will have some bearing on what you people are involved in,
whether you are patriots or not.

"I want you to know that these United States are a beautiful place. I have
gone to more than 70 countries, and I cannot remember any country that has
the beauty, as well as the magnificence of its people, like these United
States.

"To give you an overview of basically what I am, I started off and went
through engineering school. Half of my school was in that field, and I
built up a reputation for being a geological engineer, as well as a
structural engineer with both military and aerospace applications. I have
helped build two main bases in the United States that have some
significance as far as what is called the New World Order. The first base
is the one at Dulce, New Mexico. I was involved in 1979 in a firefight with
alien humanoids, and I was one of the survivors. I'm probably the only
talking survivor you will ever hear. Two other survivors are under close
guard. I am the only one left that knows the detailed files of the entire
operation. Sixty-six secret service agents, FBI, Black Berets and the like,
died in that firefight. I was there.

"Number one, part of what I am going to tell you is going to be very
shocking. Part of what I am going to tell you is probably going to be very
unbelievable, though, instead of putting your glasses on, I'm going to ask
you to put your 'scepticals' on. But please, feel free to do your own
homework. I know the Freedom of Information Act isn't much to go on, but
it's the best we've got. The local law library is a good place to look for
Congressional Records. So, if one continues to do their homework, then one
can be standing vigilant in regard to their country.



::: Deep Underground Military Bases and the Black Budget :::



"I love the country I am living in, more than I love my life, but I would
not be standing before you now, risking my life, if I did not believe it
was so. The first part of this talk is going to concern deep underground
military bases and the black budget. The Black Budget is a secretive budget
that garners 25% of the gross national product of the United States. The
Black Budget currently consumes $1.25 trillion per [2] years. At least this
amount is used in black programs, like those concerned with deep
underground military bases. Presently, there are 129 deep underground
military bases in the United States.

"They have been building these 129 bases day and night, unceasingly, since
the early 1940's. Some of them were built even earlier than that. These
bases are basically large cities underground connected by high-speed
magneto-leviton trains that have speeds up to Mach 2. Several books have
been written about this activity. Al Bielek has my only copy of one of
them. Richard Souder, a Ph.D architect, has risked his life by talking
about this. He worked with a number of government agencies on deep
underground military bases. In around where you live, in Idaho, there are
11 of them.

"The average depth of these bases is over a mile, and they again are
basically whole cities underground. They all are between 2.66 and 4.25
cubic miles in size. They have laser drilling machines that can drill a
tunnel seven miles long in one day. The Black Projects sidestep the
authority of CONGRESS, which as we know is illegal. Right now, the New
World Order is depending on these bases. If I had known at the time I was
working on them that the NWO was involved, I would not have done it. I was
lied to rather extensively.



::: Development of Military Technology, Implied German Interest in
Hyperspacial Technology, and More :::



"Basically, as far as technology is concerned, for every calendar year that
transpires, military technology increases about 44.5 years [compared with
the increase rate of 'conventional' technology]. This is why it is easy to
understand that back in 1943 they were able to create, through the use of
vacuum tube technology, a ship that could literally disappear from one
place and appear in another place. My father, Otto Oscar Schneider, fought
on both sides of the war. He was originally a U-boat captain, and was
captured and repatriated in the United States. He was involved with
different kinds of concerns, such as the A-bomb, the H-bomb and the
Philadelphia Experiment. He invented a high-speed camera that took pictures
of the first atomic (Hydrogen or H-Bomb - Branton) tests at Bikini Island
on July 12, 1946. I have original photographs of that test, and the photos
also show UFO's fleeing the bomb site at a high rate of speed. Bikini
Island at the time was infested with them, especially under the water, and
the natives had problems with their animals being mutilated. At that time,
General MacArthur felt that the next war would be with aliens from other
worlds.

"Anyway, my father laid the groundwork with theoreticians about the
Philadelphia experiment, as well as other experiments. What does that have
to do with me? Nothing, other than the fact that he was my father. I don't
agree with what he did on the other side, but I think he had a lot of guts
in coming here. He was hated in Germany. There was a $1 million reward,
payable in gold, to anyone who killed him. Obviously, they didn't succeed.
Anyway, back to our topic -- deep underground bases.



::: The Fire Fight At Dulce Base :::



"Back in 1954, under the Eisenhower administration, the 'federal'
government decided to circumvent the Constitution of the United States and
form a treaty with alien entities. It was called the 1954 Greada Treaty,
which basically made the agreement that the aliens involved could take a
few cows and test their implanting techniques on a few human beings, but
that they had to give details about the people involved. Slowly, the aliens
altered the bargain until they decided they wouldn't abide by it at all.
Back in 1979, this was the reality, and the fire-fight at Dulce occurred
quite by accident. I was involved in building an ADDITION to the deep
underground military base at Dulce, which is probably the deepest base. It
goes down seven levels and over 2.5 miles deep. At that particular time, we
had drilled four distinct holes in the desert, and we were going to link
them together and blow out large sections at a time. My job was to go down
the holes and check the rock samples, and recommend the explosive to deal
with the particular rock. As I was headed down there, we found ourselves
amidst a large cavern that was full of outer-space (or "inner-space"? -
Branton) aliens, otherwise known as large Greys. I shot two of them. At
that time, there were 30 people down there. About 40 more came down after
this started, and all of them got killed. We had surprised a whole
underground base of existing aliens. Later, we found out that they had been
living on [in] our planet for a long time... This could explain a lot of
what is behind the theory of ancient astronauts.

(Note: This report seems to reveal a limited 'perspective' on the overall
'Dulce war' conflicts based on the experience of one individual. It
appears, however, as if there was much more involved in the overall
scenario than what Phil Schneider describes. For instance from Phil's
description, it appears as if his team broke-in to the base 'accidentally'.
It could be that IN RESPONSE to the captured scientists mentioned by Thomas
Edwin Castello and others, the special forces and intel agents
intentionally attempted to break-in to the underground alien bases through
a "back door" so-to-speak, yet Schneider may have not been aware of this
part. Other reports would suggest that the conflict was more complex than
this, and involved more than one firefight. According to other sources, the
"Dulce Wars" involved AT LEAST a hundred highly-trained special forces. -
Branton)

"Anyway, I got shot in the chest with one of their weapons, which was a box
on their body, that blew a hole in me and gave me a nasty dose of cobalt
radiation. I have had cancer because of that.

"I didn't get really interested in UFO technology until I started work at
Area 51, north of Las Vegas. After about two years recuperating after the
1979 incident, I went back to work for

Morrison and Knudson, EG&G and other companies. At Area 51, they were
testing all kinds of peculiar spacecraft. How many people here are familiar
with Bob Lazar's story? He was a physicist working at Area 51 trying to
decipher the propulsion factor in some of these craft.



::: Schneider's Worries About Government Factions, Railroad Cars and
Shackle Contracts :::



"Now, I am very worried about the activity of the 'federal' government.
They have lied to the public, stonewalled senators, and have refused to
tell the truth in regard to alien matters. I can go on and on. I can tell
you that I am rather disgruntled. Recently, I knew someone who lived near
where I live in Portland, Oregon. He worked at Gunderson Steel Fabrication,
where they make railroad cars. Now, I knew this fellow for the better part
of 30 years, and he was kind of a quiet type. He came in to see me one day,
excited, and he told me "they're building prisoner cars." He was nervous.
Gunderson, he said, had a contract with the federal government to build
107,200 full length railroad cars, each with 143 pairs of shackles. There
are 11 sub-contractors in this giant project. Supposedly, Gunderson got
over 2 billion dollars for the contract. Bethlehem Steel and other steel
outfits are involved. He showed me one of the cars in the rail yards in
North Portland. He was right. If you multiply 107,200 times 143 times 11,
you come up with about 15,000,000. This is probably the number of people
who disagree with the federal government. No more can you vote any of these
people out of office. Our present structure of government is 'technocracy',
not democracy, and it is a form of feudalism.

(Note: I would venture to say that it is more like a techno-monarchy, since
several of the U.S. presidents have been placed in office with Rockefeller
financial and media backing, suggesting that these same presidential
hirelings were inclined to favor certain Rockefeller and in turn
International banking agendas. Techno-Monarchy would constitute those parts
of the Military-Industrial Complex or M.I.C. that are largely influenced by
Rockefeller interests. According to various sources, the German immigrant
Rockefellers are not the "top of the ladder" for the world conspiracy.
True, they 'control' much of the eco-political system in the UNITED STATES
of America, however they are following the agenda of the Bildeberger cult:
the 13 Wicca Masons, 13 Black Nobility, and 13 Maltese Jesuits who have
joined together UNDER the covering of the Bavarian Illuminati -- which in
turn is the modern manifestation of the joint human-alien 'serpent cult'
which seems to have had its origins within the ancient underground Masonic
systems of Egypt, a cult or collaboration that was brought to Bavaria by
the early Germanic Trade Guilds during the height of the so-called 'Holy
Roman' [German] Empire - Branton).

It [this 'technocracy'] has nothing to do with the republic of the United
States. These people are god-less, and have legislated out prayer in public
schools. You can get fined up to $100,000 and two years in prison for
praying in school. I believe we can do better. I also believe that the
federal government is running the gambit of enslaving the people of the
United States. I am not a very good speaker, but I'll keep shooting my
mouth off until somebody puts a

bullet in me, because it's worth it to talk to a group like this about
these atrocities.



::: America's Black Program Contractors :::



"There are other problems. I have some interesting 1993 figures. There are
29 prototype stealth aircraft presently. The budget from the U.S. Congress
five-year plan for these is $245.6 million. You couldn't buy the spare
parts for these black programs for that amount. So, we've been lied to. The
black budget is roughly $1.3 trillion every two years. A trillion is a
thousand billion. A trillion dollars weighs 11 tons. The U.S. Congress
never sees the books involved with this clandestine pot of gold.
Contractors of [these] programs: EG&G, Westinghouse, McDonnell Douglas,
Morrison-Knudson, Wackenhut Security Systems, Boeing Aerospace, Lorimar
Aerospace, Aerospacial in France, Mitsubishi Industries, Rider Trucks,
Bechtel, *I.G. Farben*, plus a host of hundreds more. Is this what we are
supposed to be living up to as freedom-loving people? I don't believe so.



::: Star Wars and Apparent Alien Threat :::



"Still, 68% of the military budget is directly or indirectly affected by
the black budget. Star Wars relies heavily upon stealth weaponry. By the
way, none of the stealth program would have been available if we had not
taken apart crashed alien disks. None of it. Some of you might ask what the
"space shuttle" is "shuttling". Large ingots of special metals that are
milled in space and cannot be produced on the surface of the earth. They
need the near vacuum of outer space to produce them. We are not even being
told anything close to the truth. I believe our government officials have
SOLD us down the drain -- lock, stock and barrel. Up until several weeks
ago, I was employed by the U.S. government with a Ryolite-38 clearance
factor -- one of the highest in the world. I believe the Star Wars program
is there solely to act as a buffer to prevent alien attack -- it has
nothing to do with the "cold war", which was only a ploy to garner money
from all the people -- for what? The whole lie was planned and executed for
the last 75 years.



::: Stealth Aircraft Technology Use by U.S. Agencies and the United Nations
:::



"Here's another piece of information for you folks. The Drug Enforcement
Administration and the ATF rely on stealth tactical weaponry for as much as
40% of their operations budget. This in 1993, and the figures have gone up
considerably since. The United Nations used American stealth aircraft for
over 28% of its collective worldwide operations from 1990 to 1992,
according to the Center for Strategic Studies and UN Report 3092.



::: The Guardians of Stealth and Delta Force Origins of the Bosnia Conflict
:::



"The Guardians of Stealth: There are at least three distinct
classifications of police that guard our most well-kept secrets. Number
one, the Military Joint Tactical Force [MJTF], sometimes called the Delta
Force or Black Berets, is a MULTI-NATIONAL tactical force primarily used to
guard the various stealth aircraft worldwide. By the way, there were 172
stealth aircraft built.

Ten crashed, so there were at last count about 162. Bill Clinton signed
them away about six weeks ago TO THE UNITED NATIONS. There have been
indications that the Delta Force was sent over to Bosnia during the last
days of the Bush administration as a covert sniper force, and that they
started taking pot shots at each side of the controversy, in order to
actually START the Bosnia conflict that would be used by succeeding
administrations for political purposes.



::: Thoughts on the Bombings in the United States :::



"I was hired not too long ago to do a report on the World Trade Center
bombing. I was hired because I know about the 90 some-odd varieties of
chemical explosives. I looked at the pictures taken right after the blast.
The concrete was puddled and melted. The steel and the rebar was literally
extruded up to six feet longer than its original length. There is only one
weapon that can do that -- a small nuclear weapon. That's a
construction-type nuclear device. Obviously, when they say that it was a
nitrate explosive that did the damage, they're lying 100%, folks. The
people they have in custody probably didn't do the crime. As a matter of
fact, I have reason to believe that the same group held in custody did do
other crimes, such as killing a Jewish rabbi in New York. However, I want
to further mention that with the last explosion in Oklahoma City, they are
saying that it was a nitrate or fertilizer bomb that did it.

"First, they came out and said it was a 1,000 pound fertilizer bomb. Then,
it was 1,500. Then 2,000 pounds. Now its 20,000. You CAN'T put 20,000
pounds of fertilizer in a Rider Truck. Now, I've never mixed explosives,
per se. I know the chemical structure and the application of construction
explosives. My reputation was based on it. I helped hollow out more than 13
deep underground military bases in the United States. I worked on the MALTA
project, in West Germany, in Spain and in Italy. I can tell you from
experience that a nitrate explosion would not have hardly shattered the
windows of the federal building in Oklahoma City. It would have killed a
few people and knocked part of the facing off the building, but it would
never have done that kind of damage. I believe I have been lied to, and I
am not taking it any longer, so I'm telling you that you've been lied to.



(Allow me to interject at this point five items relating to the Oklahoma
City bombing and/or the role Oklahoma City and FEMA plays in a possible
United Nations - New World Order agenda. - Branton)



#1 - From the https://-INTERNET Page: THE EYE OF THE EAGLE SPEAKS:

...An evil element of the U.S. government's CIA, known as the "Committee of
Ten," admittedly blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. The blame
was put on Timothy McVeigh [a "throw-away/patsy" like Lee Harvey Oswald].
The children were murdered to procure sympathy, money, power, and control
over the American people, and the "Constitution-loving" people known as
patriots are BLAMED [proof: see Internet, also Associated Press
Investigation -- Call EDT Short-wave Channel 12160, satellite Galaxy 6,5-G2
transponder 14]. Two CIA agents, James Black and Ron Jackson, admit to
Boswell they were part of the "Committee of Ten" who blew up the Oklahoma
City Federal Building on April 29, 1995. They gave sworn affidavits to U.S.
Justice Department officials [out of guilt for the dead children?]. They
are in hiding until the case comes to court.

On the Dan Gregory Radio Talk Show WPBR 1540, Florida, Ted Gunderson,
retired FBI Regional Director -- Mr. Gunderson tells how TWO explosions
occurred, and that the bomb used was called a barometric bomb, or "daisy
cutter." The fertilizer bomb was also a smoke screen. The ATF Office was
the blast target -- and ALL 17 ATF EMPLOYEES DID NOT SHOW UP FOR WORK that
morning. Call CNN News for a transcript of CNN News correspondent's Gary
Tuchman's May 29, 1995, CNN News interview with Edye Smith, a mother who
lost two children. She wanted to know if government employees had advance
warning of the blast because her two little boys, Chase [3 years] and
Colton [2 years], had none. "We [all the mothers who lost children] are
being TOLD to keep our mouths shut, not talk about it, don't ask those
questions."



#2 - "The Phoenix Project" is an Ashtar Collective outlet, although they do
carry 'conventional' conspiracy-related news releases. Before quoting from
"The Phoenix Project" paper I would like to make some comments on the
"Ashtar" alliance which backs this organization and its intervention in the
affairs of planet earth. It is the policy of the channeled 'Ashtar' sources
to expose certain conspiracy-related information, however in most cases the
blame for these conspiracies are laid on 'Jewish Zionism'. When you
understand the conflict between 'Jewish' and the Ashtar-backed 'Bavarian'
secret societies you may further understand this animosity. True, because
Zionism is a political force they do have some connection with the Masonic
element of the 'conspiracy', the B'nai Brith and so on, as do ALL religious
movements who stray into areas of masonic-economic-political manipulation
[which constitutes most of the major denominations by the way, considering
the massive Scottish Rite infiltration of the major denominational
structures] However 'Jewish Masonry' is NOT the dominant Masonic faction,
that place is reserved for the Jesuit's 'Scottish Rite' and the Black
Nobility's Rite of the 'Illuminati'. So then, some elements of 'Jewish
Masonry' may be 'cooperating' with the New World Order agenda, but they are
ultimately subservient to the racist power cults of BAVARIA. This is why
the Zionist Rothschilds were UNABLE TO PREVENT the slaughter of over 6
million Jews in the Holocaust, because the Jewish Masons were NOT the
dominant force. The Rothschilds' supposed economic collaborators in
America, the Germanic-racist Rockefellers, were pressured into serving and
carrying out the RACIST-EUGENIC policies of their cultic superiors in
Bavaria, in order to be allowed to maintain their economic stranglehold on
America. Following World War II, the Rockefellers recieved a flood of Nazi
War criminals into their fold, giving them refuge and immunity within their
massive corporate network.

The Jewish Masons, such as the Rothschilds, were only a PART of a THIRD
[Wicca Masonic] element of the global power network, competing with the
other two-thirds working within the Black Nobility and the Maltese Jesuit
lodges. That is, until all three agreed to work together under the
'Bildeberger' organization in order to implement the NWO and then decide
later just who would dominate it. Just why the Rothschild Wicca-Masons
would agree to become a part of the Bildeberger cult is uncertain. Perhaps
they were not fully aware of the part that the Jesuit-Rockefeller elements
played in the Nazi Holocaust, or the actual extent of the influx of Nazi
war criminals into the Rockefeller empire following the war? A more likely
explanation would be a combination of the following: Some of the Zionists
who collaborated with the Rockefellers were not fully aware of the racist
Anti-Jewish elements involved; some of the 'Jewish Masons' just didn't care
and were in essence willing to sell out their own kind in exchange for
POWER; also the Jesuit's Scottish Rite had succeeded in Infiltrating Jewish
[and York Rite British] Masonry to the point where its assimilation into
the Bavarian-controlled NWO Bildeberger cult would be ensured.

In fact there is some reason to believe that the Bavarians [and aliens?]
were using the Wicca Masons, Black Nobility and Maltese Jesuit as
HIGH-LEVEL Machievellian 'arms' to create political, economic and religious
conflict in the world. In other words the lower levels of these three
formerly 'competitive' global power cults would be individuals who were
devoted to the idea that THEIR respective lodge[s] should be in control of
the New World Order and were therefore to engage in fraternal warfare with
the 'others', the Jesuits against the Masons and vice versa for example. On
an other-planetary level it could be the Sirian-backed Masons vs the
Rigelian backed Jesuits. The Sirian humanoids and the Rigelian reptiloids,
being formerly at odds, were now being brought together by the
Aldebaran-backed Ashtarian collectivists and their 'New Galactic Order'
agenda. Planet earth is NOT the only place where 'Machievellian/Hegalian'
political agendas have been carried out. On earth the Aldebaran collective
in turn backs their 'Bavarian Black Nobility' allies and repeats the same
thesis-antithesis-synthesis scenario on earth between the Masons and
Jesuits, eventually merging them into a power structure that is ultimately
controlled [on earth] by the Bavarian black gnostic 'serpent' cult from
it's secret hideaways below Gizeh, Egypt; Pine Gap, Australia; Dulce, New
Mexico, etc. This power-center would in turn have placed its agents within
the Jesuit, Nobility and Masonic 'arms' in order to manipulate these three
power-groups towards their own ends. For instance, even though lower-level
initiates of these three lodges would favor their own lodge over the
others, the CONTROLLING ELITE of all three elements would never-the-less be
agents of the Bavarian 'Babylonian Serpent Cult' itself. Certain members of
the Black Nobility families would sell out to the cult and turn these
families in whatever direction the cult dictated; high-ranking Scottish
Rite members of the Wicca Mason faction would likewise be serving the
Bavarian agenda via the Illuminati; and the high-ranking Jesuits themselves
would in turn be serving the Bavarian elite, since Germany was after all
the headquarters of the [Un]Holy Roman Empire and NOT Rome, which
capitulated its center-of-power over to Germany following the decline of
the earlier Roman Empire.

This is one 'perspective' from which this can all be viewed, although it is
certainly not the only perspective.

According to contactee Israel Norkin however, the Ashtar or Astarte alien
collective -- which has a large following in Aldebaran and other systems
and which played an integral part in the ancient Sirian-Orion conflict over
ancient Egypt -- is a subterran/exterran alliance, a virtual 'collective
group mind', that has since been infiltrated by the 'Unholy Six' Empires of
Orion. If this is true, then this does not necessarily mean that ALL of the
members of the 'Ashtar collective' are working for UH6, especially when
more recent contactee accounts have stated that a civil war has been taking
place in Sirius. This 'war' has apparently been waged because the
'infiltrated' faction of the collective that has been infiltrated and
commandeered by the Orionite forces, has in turn broken free from the
remaining segment of the collective. This remaining segment has since
established close ties with Pleiadean non-interventionists. Actually, IF
they hold true to the non-interventionist policies, one would think that
this remaining element of the 'alliance' would give up the collectist
agenda altogether, and adopt the sovereigntist philosophy which teaches the
respect for personal sovereignty from a planetary down to an individual
level. Since a collective, hive or group mind tends to KILL human
individuality and sovereignty, such an existence would seem to be ever at
odds with non-interventionism.

Just as non-interventionists believe in planetary sovereignty, which is a
more 'cosmic' manifestation of the same principles which appear in the
American 'Bill of Rights' in respect to personal sovereignty, we must
realize that just as with America, the non-interventionists have not
"arrived" at the perfect fulfillment of their philosophy any more than the
'American dream' has become a full reality. Since this universe is
imperfect and subject to human agency, it is a continuous struggle to FIGHT
to defend liberty, freedom and sovereignty whether on an inter-planetary or
an inter personal level. So even though we must continue to fight and
struggle to maintain planetary, national or personal sovereignty in a
universe where it is continually being threatened by
parasitical-interventionist-imperialistic forces, the non-interventionist
charters of the 'Federation' and the Constitutional charters of 'America'
are nevertheless GOALS for us to work towards.

With this foundation laid then, the following are excerpts from CONTACT:
THE PHOENIX PROJECT, June 20, 1995:

"I happened to mention that I had heard, very early after the Oklahoma City
bombing, some mention of there being an 18-story underground associated
with that building, including five floors of underground parking garage
space. This tantalizing bit of news came about because some network TV
interviewer was discussing the bomb pattern with, I think, the building's
original designer or architect.

"But I never heard it mentioned again, in all the days of further
reporting, as the enormous magnitude of that tragedy continued to unfold,
amidst spin doctoring of the most dazzling intensity (that is, anti-militia
and anti-patriot 'spin-doctoring'. - Branton)

"As happens in such cases of instant news sanitation, one begins to
question if one EVER REALLY heard what one was SURE of just a week or so
earlier. After all, you would think such information couldn't easily be
hidden so well.

"So, in that 5/30/95 Front Page editorial I asked if anyone else out there
had heard about this interesting and apparently 'neglected' feature of the
Oklahoma City federal building. After all, longtime CONTACT readers are
well aware of all the diabolical, tunnel-interconnected, secret underground
facilities around the country. Thus, even the mere possibility of a major
UNDERGROUND aspect to the structure beings a whole new provocative array of
dimensions into this already bizarre picture called the 'official' Oklahoma
City blast story. For instance, the 'rumors' about serious
Fed-incriminating Waco evidence being stored at that Oklahoma City site
take on new life if an underground connection is genuine (for instance,
there were reports that some agents IGNORED wounded children and employees
among the ruins and went instead straight into the rubble to 'rescue' the
boxes of secret implicating documents deeper within the building. Or did
they remove these documents only to be destroyed at a later time, so that
'they' could claim that all of this 'evidence' had been destroyed in the
blast? - Branton).

"On 6/7/95 we recieved an interesting, excited telephone call at the
CONTACT offices from someone who had read my editorial and could confirm
having heard EARLY news reports which were not only similar to what I had
heard, but made what I heard sound like last week's used coffee grounds.
Rick Martin took the call and, after hearing the news, asked this person to
take a deep, calming breath and then put their thoughts down on paper.

"Let me quote from that letter, recieved at the CONTACT offices on 6/15/95.
This is from E.B.W., writing from the Pacific Northwest State of
Washington.

"[QUOTING] I watched the Oklahoma bombing RIGHT AFTER it happened. I had
the TV on and all of a sudden it switched to this scene where a bombing had
just taken place. At first, I did not pay much attention; I was busy doing
something else. I would listen in every once in a while. The anchorwoman,
or reporter, from the local TV station, was running around, babbling
excitedly. At least once, that I remember, all people were asked to leave
the scene and it showed everybody running like mad. They HAD FOUND
ADDITIONAL BOMBS, or bomb, and the detonation squad was called in to defuse
it.

"During all this commotion, running and reporting, the lady reporter kept
talking about the UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, which had been blown open. She kept
referring to the HUGE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS and there may be people trapped
in there. I heard her refer to the UNDERGROUND TUNNELS at least about 6 to
7 times during the period I watched. I'm not quite sure how long that was.
Maybe 1 to 2 hours.

"A lady friend of mine called me and wanted to know if I had seen the
FIREMAN ON THE SCENE, who went in front of the camera, totally freaked,
wide-eyed and scared, who talked about HUGE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS, where
ENORMOUS SUPPLIES OF ARMS WERE STORED. He said he saw MISSILES, TANKS,
ETC., ETC. I don't remember what else he saw. But HE WAS TOTALLY FREAKED
OUT. He looked like he had seen a ghost. Hope this helps.

P.S. Please don't use my name. I will try to get my friend to write down
what she knows.[END OF QUOTING]"

An 18-level underground base? CIA involvement? A huge military arsenal?
Unless I'm mistaken, could this be ONE of the NEW WORLD ORDER underground
bases mentioned by Phil Schneider? If so, then if or when an attempted
UNITED NATIONS crack-down on American Patriots, AND/OR a possible European
NEW WORLD ORDER invasion of American soil occurs... could such an invasion
come not only from the air, ground and sea, but from BELOW as well? Take
note that Oklahoma City is supposed to be one of the 'biggie' NWO transfer
points when things get rolling, or so the 'Commu-Nazi's' running the New
World Order plot hope. There are some who believe that the U.N. - N.W.O.
forces are attempting to precipitate internal civil crisis' in America as a
pretext to bringing in multi-national U.N. "peace-keeping" forces to
restore "order", that is, the "New World" type of "Order". If there is too
much resistance, then a possible U.N.-backed invasion by U.N. member
countries -- many of whom despise America anyway thanks to the likes of the
CIA -- will be initiated to help these "peace-keepers". I recently read a
news-story where the entire Iranian parliament collectively shouted "Death
to America", and from what I've heard that wasn't the first time another
countries' leadership declared their hatred for the USA and their desire to
see it [and Israel] destroyed... and we can include several Communist
dictators as well. The Iranian reaction may have been partly due to the
CIA's intervention in their affairs, however I think the main reason is
that the USA is one of Israel's strongest allies. I would suggest that we
remember that Israel is the oldest continuous culture on earth -- predating
the Chinese culture by 500 years; it is one of the smallest cultures
whereas numbers are concerned; has fought more enemies who have sought its
destruction than possibly any other nation on earth; and has against ALL
possible odds survived to this day as a single people. I would suggest that
we DO NOT cease from an alliance with the Jews. Whether one considers
Israel as having 'God' or 'good-fortune' on their side, history
nevertheless has shown that those cultures that have opposed Israel have a
strange ] way of disappearing from the face of the earth.

As for a possible New World Order takeover, some skeptics -- in spite of
the lessons that should have been learned from World War II -- claim that
conditions could never reach such a point. However what if the following
report has any truth to it?



#3 - Keep in mind that the following incident ties-together the UNITED

the American Independence movement which is the last MAJOR obstacle to

military forces now training on American soil. The following information
comes from a source which has investigated actual UNITED NATIONS
preparations, IN THE UNITED STATES, to deal with any resistance to a 'New

plans of American Corporate and European Militant 'Nazis'. The enemy of
SOVEREIGNTISM is COLLECTISM, which is also known as "Socialism". Socialism
comes in many forms: Global Socialism [Communism]; National Socialism
[Fascism]; and Corporate Socialism [Technocracy]. All three movements are
ultimately controlled by the same Luciferian cults of Bavaria who backed
Vladimir Lenin, Adolph Hitler, and John D. Rockefeller, and who are
descended from the very same cults which ruled the [Un]Holy Roman Empire
during the Dark Ages [see Revelation chapter 17]. I have only one thing to
say concerning these plans for confinement camps here in America, and I'm
sure that most of our Jewish-American citizens who share this country with
us -- ALL of us whose ancestors came from all parts of the world and from
all different cultures in order to be free from tyranny -- will agree with
me whole-heartedly when I share their battle-cry: "NEVER AGAIN!!!"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Federal Emergency Management Agency

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



Although an excellent article, the January 1995 edition of 'Monitoring
Times' magazine published only a tiny portion of what FEMA has been tasked
by Executive Order to perform. FEMA was brought into existence by E.O.
[That is, by Presidents like those who replaced or came after JFK!!! --
many of whose campaigns were financed by the Rockefellers and promoted by
Rockefeller-backed media agencies -- Presidents who have the power to
appoint their own unelected staff, create Executive Orders at a whim, and
establish secret military-industrial-intelligence agencies that are NOT
subject to Congressional oversight!]

All the frequencies I have for FEMA follow my comments here:

Federal Emergency Management Agency [F.E.M.A.] [and other emergency
agencies]:

F.E.M.A. [Federal Emergency Management Agency] has been 'authorized' for
the past 15 years by Presidential Executive Orders to confiscate ALL
PROPERTY from the American People, separate families in the current 43
internment camps [already built and operational by the way, 5 of which are
located in Georgia. The largest can confine somewhere on the order of
100,000 American citizens], called relocation camps by the 'government',
for assignment to work camps; declares martial law and TOTALLY OVER-RIDES
the U.S. Constitution. Presidential Executive Orders that are related or
control this are given at the end of this. Two of the state prisons here in
Georgia are currently empty, although manned by a minimal number of staff,
have been setup and intentionally unpopulated by prisoners just to support
this political policy.

Concentration [internment] Camps. An Executive Order signed by then
President BUSH in 1989 authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[F.E.M.A.] to build 43 primary camps [having a capacity of 35,000 to 45,000
prisoners EACH] and also authorized hundreds of secondary facilities. It is
interesting to note that several of these facilities can accommodate
100,000 prisoners. These facilities have been completed and many are
already manned but as yet contain no prisoners. [Remember all the TALK of
over-crowded prisons that exist...]. In south Georgia there are several
state prisons that except for a few guards, are completely devoid of
prisoners.

Under F.E.M.A., the Executive Orders which are already written and is the
current law of the land, calls for the COMPLETE suspension of the United
States Constitution, all rights and liberties, as they are currently known.
The following executive orders, which are in the Federal Register located
in Washington DC for anyone to request copies of, call for the suspension
of all civil rights and liberties and for extraordinary measures to be
taken in, as most of the orders state, "any national security emergency
situation that might confront the government." When F.E.M.A. is
implemented, the following executive orders will be immediately enforced:



E.O. 12148 - FEMA national security emergency, such as: national disaster,
social unrest, insurrection, OR national financial crisis.



E.O. 10995 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL communications media in
the United States."



E.O. 10997 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL electric power,
petroleum, gas, fuels and minerals, both public and private."



E.O. 10998 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL food supplies and
resources, public and private, and ALL farms, lands, and equipment."



E.O. 10999 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL means of transportation,
including PERSONAL cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and TOTAL CONTROL
over all highways, seaports, and waterways."



E.O. 11000 - "... provides for the SEIZURE OF ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE for work
forces under federal supervision, including SPLITTING UP OF FAMILIES if the
government has to."



E.O. 11001 - "... provides for government seizure of ALL health, education
and welfare functions."



E.O. 11002 - "... designates the postmaster general to operate a national
REGISTRATION of all persons." [Under this order, you would report to your
local post office to be separated and assigned to a new area. Here is where
families would be separated].



E.O. 11003 - "... provides for the government to take over ALL airports and
aircraft, commercial, public and PRIVATE."



E.O. 11004 - "... provides for the Housing and Finance Authority to
relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned and establish new
locations for populations."



E.O. 11005 - "... provides for the government to TAKE OVER railroads,
inland waterways, and public storage facilities."



E.O. 11051 - "... the office of Emergency Planning [has] complete
authorization to put the above orders into effect in time of increased
international tension or economic or financial crisis."



(What about an 'engineered' financial crisis, which in turn would most
likely lead to 'social unrest'? This all depends on the decision of the
current President. But then we must ask, just how legal is the U.S.
Presidency anyway? MANY within the Continental Congress, fearing the rise
of Monarchy, had originally opposed the establishment of a Chief Executive
position such as the one that General George Washington was elected to.
They were assured however that those who followed Washington would have his
example of integrity to base their own presidencies on. I have a
suggestion: do away with the U.S. Presidency and the entire Executive
Branch of government altogether -- especially now that it is, according to
many sources, under the control of unelected Military-Industrialists since
the coup of 1963 -- and give back control of the government to the CONGRESS
as it was in the beginning. Congress by majority vote CAN do away with the
Executive position if they choose to do so - Branton)



All of the above executive orders were combined by President NIXON (I rest
my case - Branton) into Executive Order 11490, which allows all of this to
take place if a national emergency is declared by the President. The
burning and insurrection in Los Angeles in the case of Rodney King could
have executed [and partially did execute] these Executive Orders.



Executive Order 12919: "National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness"
signed by CLINTON June 3, 1994, delegates authorities, responsibilities and
allocations of F.E.M.A.'s Executive Orders [last entry] for the
confiscation of ALL PROPERTY from the American people, and their
re-location and assignment to 'labor' camps. The Executive Order also
supersedes or revokes eleven (11) previous Executive Orders [from 1939
through 1991] and amends Executive Order 10789 and 11790. This executive
order is A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE by the [Secret]
Government of the United States in concert with the UNITED NATIONS.

Operation Dragnet. Janet Reno can implement this operation upon receiving
one call from the President. Arrest warrants will be issued via computer to
round-up over 1 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS who may 'resist' the NEW WORLD
ORDER. Americans who are not 'politically correct.' Specifically mentioned
are CHRISTIANS or those who read the Bible. Concentration/internment camps
have already been built to accommodate these American prisoners. See above
paragraph as these internment camps have been setup and are run by F.E.M.A.



(Note: In reference to Christians, just where should they/we stand in
regards to defending America? Should Christians take up arms if necessary?
Apparently the Founding fathers of the American Republic believed so, so
long as it was in order to DEFEND their country, their women and
children... and NOT in order to engage in offensive warfare for the sake of
conquering and exploiting others, which to me would be "living by the
sword" or you could say "making a living" by the sword. This could be
exemplified by the Germans who initiated unprovoked invasions of their
neighbors to meet their economic needs during World Wars I and II. One
might ask, what about all the Orthodox Jews and Greek Orthodox Christians
who went to their deaths like lambs to the slaughter without resisting
during World War II? Why didn't they fight more zealously to defend
themselves? That is a hard question and one that I don't have an answer
for. All I can say is that from my study of the Old and New Testaments, I
find no passage that forbids us from defending ourselves from aggressors --
at least in a national sense, however we ARE forbidden to become aggressors
ourselves or engage in conflicts which are offensive rather than defensive
oriented. The offensive attacks against the native Americans for instance,
resulting from the Anglo invasion of North America, can NOT be justified
through scripture, and such policies and mistreatment of the native
Americans, the continuous betrayal of treaties, and the stealing of their
God-given land in the past have or will doubtless have an adverse affect on
America's destiny UNLESS reparations are made to the native peoples -- for
instance a restoration of historical territories. Perhaps the Greys felt
justified in repeatedly violating our government's secret 'treaties' with
them because 'we' had done the exact same thing to the native Americans?
Perhaps we DESERVED the abuses that the Greys and their Bavarian
collaborators have inflicted upon us? Perhaps our nation's destiny will be
largely determined by how we treat the native Americans from here on out,
whether or not we begin to honor ALL of the treaties that 'we' had made and
broken in the past? Could it be? On the other hand, if OFFENSIVE warfare is
forbidden by God, then DEFENSIVE warfare against a foreign invasion of
American soil or an internal threat to our freedoms as they are guaranteed
in the Bill of Rights WOULD from my perspective be justified. In Psalm
125:3 we read how the rule of the wicked is a DIRECT VIOLATION of the will
of God: "...For the wicked shall not rule the godly, lest the godly be
forced to do wrong." A perfect example would be the Lutherans of Germany
who all-too-often capitulated to the Nazi's and their 'state church', in
spite of the fact that most of the Nazi leaders were themselves backed by
Luciferian cults which the Christians should have resisted. Instead, many
of these backslidden Christians in Germany grudgingly supported the
atrocities of their Nazi leaders, and by default the extermination by the
millions of Jewish men, women and children. Why could Martin Luther himself
stand alone against hundreds of pompish religious hypocrites at the council
of worms in Germany and boldly accuse them of pharasitical blasphemy and
idolatry to their face, yet many of his Protestant followers -- not
detracting from those few brave souls who DID resist -- gave-in right and
left to the Nazi satanists, and in some cases even contributed to the
atrocities of World Wars I and II? In short then, Christianity does not
teach that one SHOULD take up the sword, and it does not teach that one
SHOULD NOT take up the sword in a defensive capacity. It all depends on
one's own personal choice and faith. There is a warning however that those
who do take up the sword should consider the possibility that they might
die in battle. Then again one might die by NOT taking up the sword if they
are captured and placed in death camp. It all comes down to ones personal
choice, based on the prevailing circumstances. It is written that the "meek
shall inherit the earth". This does not mean the "weak", since the actual
meaning of "meek" is literally "a stallion in restraint" or someone who
shows self-control over their passions. Logically those who run out onto
the battlefield "to die for their country" in a blaze of suicidal zeal and
vainglory will probably do just that. Those on the other hand who are
cautious and wise and fight with the motive of "defending their family"
will not be so careless with their lives, since they are the provider of
their family as well as its defender. If they are dead then they can no
longer provide nor defend. - Branton)



Operation Rolling Thunder. Reno and Benson have mentioned this operation
which comprises county-wide sweeps of house to house, dynamic entry, search
and seizures for all guns and food stockpiles by B.A.T.F., state national
guard, activity duty soldiers, as well as local police. This function is
also run and coordinated through F.E.M.A.

Public Law 100-690 banned almost ALL RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS [not yet
enforced..]. (Note: When and if this is enforced, this will be a blatant
defecation upon the BILL OF RIGHTS, and in this event every true American
is allowed -- and in fact it will be his and her Patriotic DUTY -- to
implement the clause within the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE to OVERTHROW
such an alien, foreign or domestic tyranny-structure which has infested the
governing body of America. - Branton); grants no-knock search and seizures
without a search warrant; expands the drug laws to include EVERY American.
This will generally be the prelude, or in addition to, a F.E.M.A. operation
and contingency plan implementation.

The Omnibus Crime Bill of 1990. Ensures confiscation of all private
property via money laundering, environmental violations of the Clean Water
and Air Act, and extends as far as child abuse. This act also coordinates
activities through F.E.M.A. and the Department of the Army, Commanding
General, U.S. Forces Command, Fort McPherson, GA which is the executive and
implementing agency upon initiation of many of these acts. The responsible
agency within U.S. Army Forces Command was what used to be known as the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans Division [DCSOPS, Plans], which
was changed several years ago to J-3 after the Headquarters became a joint
headquarters. They keep on file copies of all F.E.M.A. Emergency Management
Operation Plans, including those plans developed by the Army to support the
F.E.M.A. plan to eliminate the U.S. Constitution upon implementation.
According to current plans, the Constitution will be 'temporarily'
discontinued and shelved until the real or perceived and declared 'threat'
has been neutralized (ask yourself -- who or what is the REAL threat that
needs to be 'neutralized'? - Branton). But once 'shelved,' as with almost
every other action of the Government, it STAYS shelved.

The Crime Bill of 1994. Banning of all military weapons which are necessary
to the formation of a militia [when needed], denies other military
equipment to the people's militia units (that's OK... the average American
gun owner can legally acquire this 'equipment' from off the DEAD BODIES of
FEMA-backed or related domestic/foreign gestapo forces when they
break-in-to our homes to steal our personal property or try to take us and
our families prisoner without due process of law. - Branton), prelude to
confiscating ALL guns in the hands of private citizens, DESTROYS the 1st
Amendment, and makes virtually every American an outlaw. See above comments
concerning the house-to-house search. The agency responsible for the actual
implementation and search is the Department of the Army in concert with
local and state police, including F.E.M.A., FBI, BATF, and other Federal
Agencies.

SECRET UNDERGROUND BASES. There have been documented over 60 secret,
VIRTUAL CITIES, UNDERGROUND, built by the government, Federal Reserve Bank
Owners (such as the 'Rockefellers', etc. - Branton), and high ranking
members of the Committee of 300 [some of these underground areas can be
seen in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas]. In additional,
there exist underground Satellite Tracking Facilities which have the
ability to punch your 911 address into the computer and a satellite can
within seconds bring a camera to bear on your property to the point that
those monitoring can read a license number on an automobile in your
driveway. These facilities have as of Oct. 1, 1994, been turned over to the
[foreign power of the] UNITED NATIONS. (Note: Forget the license plate,
according to Norio Hayakawa, this satellite technology is now so
sophisticated that they can CLEARLY read every word on your driver's
LICENSE, supposing it were in view of the satellite. - Branton)



#5 - HAS IT ALREADY BEGUN? U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS -- SHACKLED BY U.N.
FORCES



A report from SEVENTH WEEK MAGAZINE states that U.S. Military Officers were
observed gagged, cuffed, and shackled to their seats aboard a white U.N.
747 en-route to the Federal Transfer Center near OKLAHOMA CITY! Part of
this report follows:

"At a survival/preparation seminar in S.E. Oklahoma, on 3/25/95, an
attendee interrupted one speaker, and stated that a neighbor, who
apparently serves as a reserve crew member aboard one of the all white,
unmarked, United Nations B-747 aircraft [which are assigned to FEMA, Black
Operations, i.e. U.N. / N.W.O and hubbed at the Federal (prisoner) Transfer
Center or FTC at WILL ROGERS AIRPORT], had been dead-heading back to
Oklahoma City on the flight. He descended from the flight deck to see what
the "prisoner cargo" consisted of, however, not only did he see the normal
armed, black uniformed guards, and a load of bound humans, but he saw
several U.S. Military officers, in full uniform, gagged, and shackled to
their seats! They were in the front of the cabin, and from their visages,
he discerned that they were violently angry at their situation. No doubt!

"At this point I guess you might think this is a joke? Nope, because in
April 1993, and July 1994, an ex-Army intelligence analyst postulated THIS
EXACT SCENARIO would happen! He also stated, in the 94 interview, 'they'
were going to use white 747's to fly 'detained' [kidnapped] conservative,
etc., etc., 'political' prisoners around the U.S., via the TFC, to the
NOW-existing, 130 FEMA "RESISTER/DISSIDENT" DETENTION CAMPS. The above
operation, among many others in this overall incredible takeover
conspiracy, INCLUDES EARLY-ON LEADERSHIP KIDNAPPING, PERFORMED BY FOREIGN
[ASIAN] CREWS NOW HIDDEN IN THE U.S. [on 'closed' U.S. bases] (UNDER closed
military bases? - Branton), using the 3,000 choppers provided TO THE U.N.
under the auspices of the 1989 "Open Skies Treaty," signed by good ole New
World Order Sultan George Bush; a member of the Skull and Bones Secret
Society, and the Trilateral Commission. The Treaty allows for the aerial
observation of the U.S. [and, yes, your house -- if you have been tagged
for observation, along with your phone being tapped], No Questions Asked!
The majority of the recent BLACK CHOPPER sorties have nothing to do with
lawful military/police department operations, but are presently locating,
and setting up for seizure, people/guns, who will not take the 'mark' of
the coming One World Government/Order! So PREPARE accordingly!"



(With the preceding confirmation of his claims, we now return to the Phil
Schneider lecture. - Branton):



::: The Truth Behind the Republican Contract With America :::



"I don't perceive at this time that we have too much more than six months
of life left in this country, at the present rate. We are the laughing
stock of the world, because we are being hood-winked by so many evil people
that are running this country. I think we can do better. I think the people
over 45 are seriously worried about their future. I'm going to run some
scary scenarios by you. The Contract With America. It contains the same
terminology that Adolph Hitler used to subvert Germany in 1931. I believe
we can do better. The Contract With America (or is it the "Contract ON
America"? - Branton) is a last ditch effort by our federal government to
tear away the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.



::: Some Statistics on the Black Helicopter Presence :::



"The black helicopters. There are over 64,000 black helicopters in the
United States. For every hour that goes by, there is one being built. Is
this the proper use of our money? What does the federal government need
64,000 tactical helicopters for, if they are not trying to enslave us. I
doubt if the entire military needs 64,000 worldwide. I doubt if all the
world needs that many. There are 157 F-117A stealth aircraft loaded with
LIDAR and computer-enhanced imaging radar. They can see you walking from
room to room when they fly over your house. They see objects in the house
from the air with a variation limit of 1 inch to 30,000 miles. That's how
accurate that is. Now, I worked in the federal government for a long time,
and I know exactly how they handle their business.



::: Government Earthquake Device, AIDS as a Bioweapon based on Alien
Excretions :::



"The federal government has now invented an earthquake device. I am a
geologist, and I know what I am talking about. With the Kobe earthquake in
Japan, there was no pulsewave as in a normal earthquake. None. In 1989,
there was an earthquake in San Francisco. There was no pulse wave with that
one either. It is a Tesla device that is being used for evil purposes. The
black budget programs have subverted science as we know it. Look at AIDs,
invented by the National Ordinance Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois in 1972
(and passed to the United Nations - World Health Organization via the
military Biogenetics facility at Ft. Detrick, Maryland to be injected into
Small Pox vaccines in Africa and Hepatitus-2 vaccines in America, according
to Drs. William Campbell Douglas, Alan Cantwell, Jr. and Dr. Robert
Strecker - Branton). It was a biological weapon to be used against the
people of the United States. The reason I know this is that I have seen the
documentation by the Office of Strategic Services, which by the way is
still in operation to this day, through the CDC in Atlanta. They used the
glandular excretions of animals, humans and alien humanoids to create the
virus. (according to the above mentioned Drs., part of the production of
the virus involved the splicing of the Bovine Leukemia and Sheep Visna
viruses in cancered human-tissue cultures. - Branton) These alien humanoids
the government is hobnobbing with are the worst news. There is absolutely
no defense against their germs -- none. They are a biological weapon of
terrible consequence. Every alien [Gray] on the planet needs to be
isolated.

"Saddam Hussein killed 3.5 MILLION Kurdish people with a similar biological
weapon. Do we, the people of this planet, deserve this? No, we don't, but
we are not doing anything about it. Every moment we waste, we are doing
other people on the planet a disservice. Right now, I am dying of cancer
that I contracted because of my work for the federal government. I might
live six months. I might not. I will tell you one thing. If I keep speaking
out like I am, maybe God will give me the life to talk my head off. I will
break every law that it takes to talk my head off. ELEVEN of my best
friends in the last 22 years have been MURDERED. Eight of the murders were
called 'suicides.' Before I went to talk in Las Vegas, I drove a friend
down to Joshua Tree, near 29 Palms. I drove into the mountains in order to
get to Needles, California, and I was followed by two government E-350 vans
with G-14 plates, each with a couple of occupants, one of which had an Uzi.
I knew exactly who they were. I have spoken 19 times and have probably
reached 45,000 people. Well, I got ahead of them and came to a stop in the
middle of the road. They both went on either side of me and down a ravine.
Is this what its going to take? I cut up my security card and sent it back
to the government, and told them if I was threatened, and I have been, that
I was going to upload 140,000 pages of documentation to the internet about
[secret] government structure and the whole plan. I have already begun that
task.



"Thank you very much."

[Following is yet another article downloaded from the Internet with
reference to Phil Schneider. Although not written by Schneider himself, the
following is an interview with a woman who was aquatinted with the late
underground base technician. Although many of the joint CIA-Alien bases
have no 'obvious' or overt surface presence or facilities -- for instance
Deep Springs, CA; Mercury, NV; Page, AZ; Dulce, NM -- OTHER underground
facilities involved with the joint Bavarian-Alien New World Order agenda,
aside from those existing below most of the active and 'deactivated'
military bases, DO include surface facilities, and some of these for some
strange reason are located directly below major Air Port terminals. For
instance there is a large underground FEMA base below the Salt Lake City
airport; another apparently exists at the Oklahoma City airport which
serves as a joint FEMA - UNITED NATIONS "New World Order"
detention/transfer center; however the most unusual 'Airport' of this
nature seems to be the newer Denver International Airport, as described in

Leading Edge Research: The KSEO 4/26/96 Interview with Alex Christopher.
Extract from Leading Edge International Research Journal #92. The KSEO
4/26/96 Interview with Alex Christopher, Author of "Pandora's Box" and
"Pandora's Box II". Transcript 6/1/96 by Leading Edge Research Group.
Legend: DA [Dave Alan, Host] AC: [Alex Christopher] C: [Caller]



DA: My special guest tonight is Alex Christopher, author of "Pandora's
Box", an expose of the British instigation through Washington D.C. over the
last 200 years (or more precisely, British-based Masonry, and most notably
Scottish Rite Masonry which has long-since infiltrated British and American
Masonry. - Branton). You thought you were free? This stuff has been going
on forever. The idea was to make us perceive we were "free and
independent"... She has a lot of information here, and we are going to have
to have her back again for more. I talked to her last night. Just a
fascinating individual. She is going to talk about the Montauk Project and
extraterrestrial influences, and more. So, Alex, where do you start?



AC: Somebody told me one time, start in the middle and go from there. If
you want to, pick a subject and we'll start from there.



DA: Last night we talked about a few things. We talked about the Denver
airport last night and what is really going on down there, and we talked a
bit about the Montauk project and Al Bielek, and then we skipped around a
bit about some of the things in Pandora's Box. You mentioned that the Queen
of England has been buying up a lot of property in Colorado under a
pseudonym. Why don't we start on the subject of the British. (Note:
according to former British Intelligence agent Dr. John Coleman, the
London-based Wicca Mason lodges are one-third of the overall global
conspiracy. The other two thirds are the Black Nobility banking families
who claim direct descent from the early Roman emperors, and also the
Maltese Jesuits or the Jesuit - Knights of Malta network. All three
networks each have 13 representatives within the Bilderberg organization,
which is a cover for the Bavarian Illuminati, suggestive that Bavaria
itself has orchestrated a "marriage of convenience" between these three
formerly competitive global control groups. - Branton)



AC: All right. The information, primarily, that is in "Pandora's Box"
covers how the major corporations, railroad and banking concerns in this
country were set up through a 'trust' that was originally known as the
Virginia Company... The deal was that everything would remain under English
control, or subservient to it, and that brings us right up to today,
because we are still looking at everything falling under that 'trust'
system going back to the Crown of England. It is mind boggling to think
that everyone in this country has been led to believe that the people in
the United States had won independence from England, when in fact they
never did.



DA: Well, look at President Bush, wherein two years ago he went to England
and was knighted by the Queen. Where is that coming from? Is it that he was
a faithful servant? (Bush is allegedly a high-level Mason, and a member of
the neo-Masonic Skull & Bones lodge. - Branton)



AC: You bet. All of them are doing the bidding, and it goes back to their
secret societies and the establishment of the New World Order, which all
leads back to the house of Windsor. There has been in this country for a
long time a grooming process whereby people carry on the bidding of the
Crown of England. (I did incidentally have somewhat of a confirmation of
this when a friend told me that an American judge confided to her that the
judicial system in America is now based after the monarchical judicial
court systems of England. - Branton) That is one of the things the system
involving the Rhodes Scholars was set up to achieve. Cecil Rhodes set it up
to groom people for this task, to carry the United States into the New
World Order. It appears, from what I have been able to find out, that the
Crown of England has had this very skillfully planned for hundreds of
years, and it could be possible that they have been privy to information
that not many of us have been [privy to] for a long long time, about the
chaos involving Earth changes that are coming. It is my understanding that
England is not going to make it through the changes, so they set up a whole
new Empire over here. That goes back to some of the things we discussed
before, about lands being bought up in Colorado.



(Note: With the fascination Britons have with time-travel, "DR. WHO" and
so-on, is it possible that British intelligence could have gained a glimpse
into the future and 'seen' what was coming? The Britons have British
Columbia, Canada as their possession -- if they are so desperate and
convinced that their nation will not survive the 'changes', then why not
move the British Empire to B.C. rather than risk offending Americans by
opening old wounds that date back to the revolutionary war, and losing
their World War I and World War II allies in the process? Just as in
America, it is not the general CITIZENS of Britain who pose a threat to
freedom, it is the so-called 'elite', the Rockefellers of America and the
Rothschilds of Britain who would and have SOLD-OUT their own peoples for
personal gain and god-like domination over the lower classes. The Americans
and Britons who fought and died together on the battlefields of World War I
and II did not realize that the Rothschild-Rockefeller monarchies were the
one's who had betrayed them by helping to CREATE the 'monster' that they
were fighting in both world wars for the sole purpose of gaining even
greater wealth and power. In the end it all came down to base human greed!
America has strayed a long ways from the ideals established by the founders
of the U.S. Constitution. And, needless to say, Britain has strayed a long
ways from the ideals established by the legendary King Arthur whose
greatness came from his ability to make all of his knights equals amidst
the 'round-table' rather than succumb to vainglory and the temptation of
establishing himself as some kind of human deity. Whether the legend of
King Arthur was based on fact or not, the IDEALS themselves are
nether-the-less real and true. - Branton).



DA: Yes, the area is of a pretty high altitude, where it will be safe.



AC: Yes. Plus, all the symbolism that is apparent in the layout of the new
Denver airport says that it is "a control center for world control". There
is a lot of "secret society" symbology at the airport. We started
researching all of this to find out what it all means. It's all very scary.
A gentlemen by the name of Al Bielek, who has been involved in some very
unusual government projects in the past, told me that "the Denver area is
where the establishment of the Western sector of the New World Order will
be in the United States". Little bits and pieces keep coming to me,
confirming things I have not had confirmed before.



DA: Do you know of John Coleman?



AC: The Committee of 300?



DA: Yes. What's your take on that?



AC: I think his information is fantastic. If he had had the information
that I put in "Pandora's Box" when I put that together, it would have blown
his mind. But, as far as I know from my standpoint, both sets of material
go hand in hand, right down the line.



DA: Some of these things about the background of the British invasion,
taking over the land over here while they let us think that we are running
this country. How they had a bone to pick with the Czar of Russia years
ago, how they have pushed the socialist revolution....like they say, the
sun never sets on British soil. About some of these things on the airport
in Denver. Would you mind discussing some of those things again?



AC: Well, the first thing that got my attention at the airport was the
'capstone' that I saw in a photograph, that had a Masonic symbol on it. So,
I really wanted to go to the airport and see that, because I thought it was
very unusual.



DA: The capstone?



AC: The capstone, or the dedication stone, for the Denver airport has a
Masonic symbol on it. A whole group of us went out to the airport to see
some friends off and see this capstone, which also has a time capsule
imbedded inside it. It sits at the south eastern side of the terminal
which, by the way, is called "The Great Hall", which is what Masons refer
to as their meeting hall. And, on this thing it mentions "the New World
Airport Commission". I have never heard of that, have you?



DA: Never.



AC: It has a Masonic symbol on it, and it also has very unusual geometric
designs. It depicts an arm rising up out of it that curves at a 45 degree
angle. It also has a thing that looks like a keypad on it. This capstone
structure is made of carved granite and stainless steel, and it is very
fancy.. This little keypad area at the end of the arm has an out-of-place
unfinished wooden block sitting on it. The gentleman that was with me on
the first trip out to the airport has since died. They say he committed
suicide, but everything else tells me that this is not possible. No one can
double-tie a catheter behind his own neck and strangle himself. I just
don't think that is possible. But, his name was Phil Schneider, and he
started blowing the whistle on all this stuff going on in the underground
bases that he had helped build for years and years. He worked on the
underground bases at Area 51 and Dulce, New Mexico, as well as several
other places. Schneider told me that this keypad-looking area looked like a
form of techno-geometry that is "alien-oriented", and that it had something
to do with a "directional system", whatever that meant, that functioned as
a homing beacon to bring ships right into the "Great Hall".



In the same general area on this capstone, there are some most unusual
designs on the floor that are all Masonic in nature, which lead right back
to the "Black Sun" [Editor Note: According to Al Bielek, Schneider's father
was a U-boat captain during the Nazi regime who was also on the Eldridge in
1943 in a medical capacity], which goes back to Nazi symbology. See, the
"secret societies" are supposedly into Sun worship. The Nazi's were into
"Black Sun" worship, which connects with the idea of Saturn. Saturn and
Satanism kind of go hand-in-hand. (Note: The "Black Sun" also refers to the
massive black hole at the center of our galaxy. In regards to "unusual
designs on the floor", one source claims that the base of the Hoover Dam
near Las Vegas, not far from Area 51, contains "wild inlays" of occultic
and masonic zodiacal symbolism. Reports stated that as the cliffs were
being blasted open to make way for the dam, huge caverns were penetrated.
Could these have connections with the underground network? Another unusual
dam is the Glen Canyon dam near Page, Arizona which could conceivably
provide hydroelectric power to a base that allegedly lies below the area
and ties the Dulce and Area 51 bases together subterraneally. - Branton)
Then, we have this system of murals at the airport that are the most
grotesque things you've ever seen.



DA: What's on the murals?



AC: I say that they are about what they plan to do to us, and the world as
a whole, not what has happened or some fantasy. One of them that is very
unusual has three caskets with dead people in them...



DA: That's part of the ritual connected with the Skull & Bones Club.



Yes. There are evidently three groups of people that they would like to see
dead. The first casket has what the artist told me was a Jewish-American
child, a little girl, and she has the 'star' on her clothes and a little
Bible and a locket... (this may be a depiction of both Judeo&Christian
believers, both of whom have historically been the target of the
'inquisitions' of some of the more occultic secret societies of Europe,
such as the Thule-backed inquisition against the Jews and the Jesuit-backed
inquisition against the Protestants. - Branton)



DA: Jewish lineage is passed through the female...



AC: Yes. Well, all these caskets depict women who are dead. Then, in the
center casket there is depicted a Native American woman, and the last
casket has a black woman in it. Now, normally I would not have thought too
much about these murals if I had not done a lot of research. Even in the
government documents I have run across gene-splicing discussions on how
they would like to "splice out specific races", and also whoever these
people are do not like the Jewish people. This is just one of the murals,
and these murals are huge. This same mural depicts the destruction of a
city and the forest, and there is a little girl holding a Mayan tablet that
speaks of the destruction of civilization. There is a mural that depicts
this 'thing' standing over a city that looks like a green "Darth Vader",
with a sword, that has destroyed the city. This character is huge, and
there is a road depicted with women walking holding dead babies. This same
mural extends over to another mural which depicts all of the children of
the world taking the weapons from each country on earth and giving them to
a central figure which is a GERMAN boy who has this iron fist and anvil in
his hand that is totally out of proportion to the child's body, beating the
swords into plowshares. I thought, well, this is very odd depicting a
German child doing this. What all this symbology on the airport murals
seems to convey is that not only do we have a secret society behind this,
but that it is a German [Bavarian] secret society behind this, working in
the vicinity of this New World Control Center.



DA: It is interesting when you consider Operation Paperclip wherein all
these Nazi's were brought to the United States to be groomed, financed, and
basically brought back into power.



(Note: That is, by the Rockefeller cartel who supplied Nazi Germany with
the oil and materials necessary to keep their war machine operating.
Rockefeller-connected OIL companies include EXXON, ARCO, ZAPATA, etc. It is
alleged that these corporations initially took in and gave refuge to some
3000 Nazi SS war criminals by providing them with immunity, new identities,
and positions within the Bavarian-backed Rockefeller corporate empire and
within the CIA -- with the help of Bavarian agents like Allen Dulles, Otto
Scorzeny, Reinhard Gehlen and later Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.
These were then used as a covert force to destroy American independence and
make America subject to a Bavarian-backed New World Order. Remember even
through the Bilderbergers consist of a "marriage of convenience" between
Londonese Wicca Masons, Basilian Black Nobility and Roman Maltese
Jesuits... the supreme controllers of the Bildeberger cult itself are the
secret black gnostic cults of Bavaria whose 'Cult of the Serpent' -- or
Illuminati -- can be traced back to Egypt and ultimately to Babylon itself.
These Rockefeller-Nazi projects reportedly continued through at least 1975
during which period many thousands more "underground Nazis" were brought
into America from Europe and also, if we are to believe some reports, from
the secret German "New Berlin" base under the mountains of Neu
Schwabenland, Antarctica that was established during World War II via
Nazi-occupied South Africa. Is Neu Schwabenland the REAL power behind the
joint Bavarian-Alien New World Order Agenda? The fact that British and
American Masons would be pulled into a Bavarian-backed New World Order
conspiracy run by anti-British Nazi's and anti-Masonic Jesuits -- in spite
of the animosities of World Wars I and II -- would seem contradictory to
the extreme. However NOT if we consider the fact that Roman Jesuits had
secretly created the Scottish Rite of Masonry at the Jesuit college of
Clermont in France and also the Bavarian Illuminati via the Jesuit Adam
Weishaupt. Both the Illuminati and Scottish Rite worked together to
INFILTRATE Masonry and subdue the traditional Judeo-Christian York Rite.
The Masonic elitists in Great Britain and America would have as a result of
this infiltration become subject to the influences of the Scottish Rite
dominated 33rd degree -- falsely believing that 'Masonry' was still the
enemy of the 'Jesuits', as in earlier times the conflict between the two
was notorious. They might have been deceived into believing that 'British
Masonry' would come out on top of the New World Order when in fact Rome and
Bavaria, the two power-centers of the old [Un]Holy Roman Empire, had the
REAL control. But blinded by their own delusions of grandeur and world
domination, the British elite failed to see how their Masonic lodges were
being infiltrated and manipulated by their sworn enemies. Some of the elite
might have been oblivious to the ins-and-outs of Masonry altogether, being
conscious only of their own greed. - Branton)



AC: Well, I know they're here, because I have seen them [Germans] alongside
the Americans in the more sensitive areas of the airport. But, these
paintings are most disturbing and very unusual. When I first tried to
contact the artist and talk to him about these murals, he told me that he
was given guidelines on what to paint and put in the murals. When I showed
up in his studio, I asked to see the guidelines for the last two murals he
was working on, he suddenly went "brain dead" and said "of course, there
are no guidelines." It took myself and two other people over eight months
to figure out all the symbology that is embodied in these murals. It turned
out that some of these are 'trigger' pictures, containing symbology
designed to trigger altered personalities of people that have been groomed
in MKULTRA type programs for specific tasks that they have been trained to
do in terms of something connected with Satanic rituals and mind control. I
had one woman that called me out of the blue one night, and she was really
disturbed about some information. She told me many different things that
later turned out to be known MKULTRA triggers. Also, almost every aspect of
these murals contains symbols relating back to secret societies. When you
get the overall view of what they are talking about in these things, it is
very very scary. It goes back to the Bio-diversity Treaty, getting rid of
specific races of people, taking over the world and mind control.

There is one picture in which every plant turns out to be mind-altering or
poisonous, and all the animals are Masonic symbols used in literature in
every country in the world. It took a very long time to track all this
stuff down and figure out what they're trying to say. The one way they tell
stories is in pictures. It's right there in our face when you go into the
airport. Most people look at them and say, "those are crazy-looking
pictures, what are they doing in this airport?"



DA: Now, you mentioned that underneath this airport it goes down many
levels.



AC: Yes.



DA: Does the fact that all these underground levels are there have
something to do with why it took so long for this airport to open?



AC: Well, the gentleman that I was dealing with, Phil Schneider, said that
during the last year of construction they were connecting the underground
airport system to the deep underground base. He told me that there was at
least an eight-level deep underground base there, and that there was a 4.5
square mile underground city and an 88.5 square-mile base underneath the
airport. It is very unusual that they would allot a 50 square-mile area on
the surface at which to locate an airport in the middle of nowhere unless
they really planned to use it for something very unusual later. There is a
10-mile, 4-line highway out to this airport, and there is nothing out there
in between the airport and Denver. Not even a service station, at least in
September 1995. The people in Denver are really upset with the fact that
this airport went in the way it did.

There was this fellow who wrote a book in which he made the statement that
they had a copy of an audio tape on which a Denver city official was
talking with people from the CIA, and that he was paid 1.5 million dollars
to allow the 'airport' to be built, no matter what it took. It appears that
there was a lot more interest in getting the airport built from just
officials in the Denver area. They plan on using this facility for
something else other than just landing planes.



DA: So, this guy got you down there to take a look at the underground?



AC: Well, he was invited to go along on the trip. I had a friend that
actually got us down into the active area in the underground. It's very
interesting down there. The baggage equipment area is very unusual. All the
old luggage equipment that wouldn't work right doesn't look much different

than the stuff that is working today.



DA: You were telling me that there are huge concrete corridors with
sprinklers all along the ceiling. What are these sprinkler heads doing in a
concrete bunker, pray tell? (Presumably concrete will not 'burn' if there
is a potential fire, so is it possible that something other than 'water' is
meant to be expelled from these sprinklers which are located "all along"
the ceiling? - Branton)



AC: Well, this is the same question we asked. These shafts are huge and run
along adjacent to the tramline on both sides. So, there are two of these
huge shafts large enough to fit a two-lane highway in there. There are very
FEW openings into and out of the tram shaft, but at the end of them, going
out into this 50 square miles of acreage is a huge steel door that would
facilitate the entrance of a great big truck. It could be used for almost
anything, but what is so unusual about it is that about EVERY FIVE OR SIX
FEET on the ceiling, across almost the full width of the area, there is a
pipe with three or four sprinkler heads. This goes on for the FULL length
of the thing, "which must be close to a mile". There are two of these
shafts, and I got a picture in the mail the other day which was very
unusual that was taken by someone on board the tram in the shaft. The
picture appeared to actually show ghost-like figures on it. It was a mother
and a baby wrapped in a blanket. When you are down in that concrete shaft,
both times I got nauseated. There are some very unusual vibrations down
there (from other 'time dimensions'? - Branton). Now, the tunnel shaft that
the tram comes in on could connect up with an underground tunnel coming in
from five buildings that were built and buried. There was already a 40 foot
diameter tunnel there when construction started. Those five buildings they
built 3 1/2 years ago, and suddenly they said "oops, these are in the wrong
place", and buried them, along with a very high-tech runway that is buried
under about four inches of dirt. It seems insane that they would build a
very technical building complex with interlocking tunnels and a tunnel
going back to the tram tunnel at the concourse, and then state that they
built it in the "wrong place" and cover it up with dirt. I don't believe
that people are that stupid.



DA: No. Projects like that are strategically planned, and they just don't
go and do that.



AC: Some of these five buildings are 150 feet tall. There is one 78 feet
tall, and one that is 126 feet tall. They are all in that range. From this
complex there is a shaft that runs to concourse "C". When they started this
project, as I said, there was also a huge 40 foot diameter shaft brought in
there from somewhere that was off-limits to the work crews. It was there
when the project was started. And, everybody that worked on these
projects....there were five different contractors, and the people on each
contracted crew did not interact with the other ones. When the project was
done, everyone was fired and sent away.



DA: You would think that during this massive construction they would not be
able to keep this stuff secret.



AC: I think a lot of the people saw things that disturbed them so much that
they would not talk about it. I know several people who worked on the
project that managed to find their way down into the depths, probably close
to the deep underground base, and saw things that scared them so badly they
won't talk about it. I interviewed a few of the former employees on these
construction crews that worked out there on these buildings that ended up
buried, and they are afraid to talk. They say that everybody is real
nervous about it, and they decided to tell some of the secrets that they
knew, but they don't want anybody to know who they are. So, I can tell you
that it is a very unusual and spooky type of place, and if you are a
sensitive person you get nauseated as soon as you enter the perimeter of
the airport. Especially when you go down underground. You become very
nauseated a nervous. There is also so much electromagnetic flux in the area
that if you get out on the open ground around the airport, you will 'buzz'.



DA: Where is this flux field coming from? What do you think the purpose of
this is?



AC: I think that its coming from some kind of underground electrical
system, because where we were there were no power lines, and the whole
place was just buzzing with this free energy floating around. Very unusual.
In addition, there are areas in the underground that have chain-link fences
with the barbed wire tops pointed inward, like they were there to keep
people in, not keep people out. All these areas are there, acres of it, and
none of it is in active use. There are many terraced areas that go down.
One area in particular is forbidden to go into unless you are wearing a
biological protective suit. They say there is some kind of "unidentified
biological fungus" in that area that attacks people's lungs.



DA: Hmmm. Some kind of way to hide something that is in this area?



AC: Well, we think that area is one that leads to deeper levels underground
at the airport. But, it is surrounded by a chain-link fence and you can't
get in there. We think this is the area that one of the electricians kind
of stumbled into that went down about six levels below the fourth level,
and ran into some really weird stuff. He won't talk about any of it now.



DA: Real weird stuff.



AC: Also, at the airport there are what look like miniature nuclear reactor
cooling towers, and I don't understand why they are there. When people
asked, the reply is that they are part of the ventilation and exhaust
system. Ventilation and exhaust from where?



DA: What do you think its for?



AC: I think it is all hooked up to the deep underground.



DA: They say that this place looks like some underground "holding
area"...somewhat like a cattle lot....a place that could hold thousands of
people. The gates, fences....



AC: The luggage transport vehicles move on a full-sized double-lane
highway, and along this highway are chain-linked areas that could be used
for holding areas. I don't understand why they built this the way they did,
unless they planned to use it for something like that in the future.



DA: So what could all this be for?



AC: If Phil is right, and all this hooks up to the deep underground base
that he was offered the plans to build back in 1979, and that what this
other man TOLD me in private [is] that there is a lot of human SLAVE LABOR
in these deep underground bases being used by these aliens, and that a lot
of this slave labor is children. HE SAID that when the children reach the
point that they are unable to work any more, they are slaughtered on the
spot and consumed.



DA: Consumed by who?



AC: Aliens. Again, this is not from me, but from a man that gave his life
to get this information out. He worked down there for close to 20 years,
and he knew everything that was going on.



DA: Hmmm. Who do these aliens eat?



AC: They specifically like young human children, that haven't been
contaminated like adults. Well, there is a gentleman out giving a lot of
information from a source he gets it from, and he says that there is an
incredible number of children snatched in this country.



DA: Over 200,000 each year.



AC: And that these children are the main entree for dinner.



(Note: Many will read this and scoff in utter disbelief at such a claim.
This is all well and fine, and even Phil Schneider warns us to put on our
'skepticals' when investigating claims and to investigate them so that they
can be definitively proven one way or the other, as all claims of an
extraordinary nature should be. So, I would suggest that Congress by-pass
the EXECUTIVE branch of government -- which has sold-out to the
Intelligence-Military-Industrial Complex, a branch that was originally
intended by the founders of the Republic to be the 'servants' of CONGRESS,
the SENATE and the PEOPLE -- and undertake a full-scale investigation of
this and other underground bases, even if this calls for full-scale
Congress-backed military mobilization. The excuse for such an undertaking
could for instance be to investigate claims of unethical use of U.S. tax
dollars, violations of Federal Medical Regulations in regards to genetic
research, failure to pay property taxes on underground facilities used by
non-elected officials, harboring of "illegal aliens", bribery and treason,
illegal cattle rustling in regards to the Dulce and other bases, possible
kidnapping and human rights abuses against children, and so on... -
Branton)



DA: How many Draconians are down there?



AC: I have heard the figure of 150,000 just in the New York area.



DA: Underneath New York?



AC: Yes. In some kind of underground base there.



DA: Interesting. Now, you've seen pictures of these things?



AC: I have seen them face to face.



DA: You have?



AC: Yes. From some information that has been put out by a group or team
that also works in these underground bases that is trying to get
information out to people that love this country, THERE IS A WAR THAT IS
GOING ON UNDER OUT FEET, AND ABOVE OUR HEADS, that the public doesn't know
anything about, and its between these ALIEN forces and the HUMANS that are
trying to fight them.



DA: What other types have you seen?



AC: The ones that I have seen are the big-eyed Greys and the Reptilians.



DA: What do these Reptilians look like?



AC: There are three different types.



DA: Can you tell us how you happened to come into contact with them?



AC: When I lived in Florida in Panama City, at that particular time the
Gulf Breeze sightings were going on, and the area was virtually a hotbed
for strange events. I had neighbors that were into watching UFOs and
getting information about them. One night about 2:30 am, my neighbor called
me and was absolutely frantic, and wanted me to come over there. I ran over
there and went in the front door, and she and her boyfriend, who is a
commercial airline pilot, were in the living room scared out of their wits.
I looked over at her, and her eyeballs are rolling back in her head and she
was passing out and sliding down the wall. Her boyfriend was trying to tell
me what was going on, and I was feeling this incredible energy that felt
like it was trying to penetrate my head. So, I grabbed both of them and
pulled them both outside, where we stood for a while and talked...



DA: Some people would say that this is a case of demon possession...



AC: Oh, no. There was radiation in the room. The next day all of her plants
were dead. So, there was a massive amount of energy focused on that room.
Anyway, after about an hour had passed, we had discussed what went on and
decided to go back into the house. They had both been in bed and were
pulled out of their bed during the night. All they remember is a flash of
light in their faces and the next thing they know they're both scared to
death. But, when we went back into the house, I noticed that the man had a
small palm-print on his side with fingers that must have been 10 inches
long, with claw marks on the end that were burned into his side. The next
day, that area was so swollen that he could not touch it. I have video
pictures of these things on his side. The prints were there from someone
bending down from behind him and pulling him out of bed. They had been
making love, and 'somebody' lifted him off of her and left these burns
there.

Anyway, they were both totally flipped out. I finally got them calmed down
enough to let me go home. I went home and went to bed. The next thing I
know, I woke up and there is this 'thing' standing over my bed. He had
wrap-around yellow eyes with snake pupils, and pointed ears and a grin that
wrapped around his head. He had a silvery suit on, and this scared the
living daylights out of me. I threw the covers over my head and started
screaming....I mean, here is this thing with a Cheshire-cat grin and these
funky glowing eyes...this is too much. I have seen that kind of being on
more than one occasion.



DA: What else can you say about it?



AC: Well, he had a hooked nose and he was [humanoid] looking, other than
the eyes, and had kind of grayish skin. Later on in 1991, I was working in
a building in a large city, and I had taken a break about 6:00, and the
next thing I knew it was 10:30 at night, and I thought I had taken a short
break. I started remembering that I was taken aboard a ship, through four
floors of an office building, and through a roof. There on the ship is were
I encountered 'GERMANS' AND 'AMERICANS' WORKING TOGETHER, and also the GREY
ALIENS, and then we were taken to some other kind of facility and there I
saw the REPTILIANS again ... the one's I call the "baby Godzilla's", that
have the short teeth and yellow slanted eyes, and who look like a
VELOCI-RAPTOR, kind of.



DA: So, why would these people pick on you?



AC: Well, I found one common denominator in the abduction, and it keeps on
being repeated over and over again. I deal with lots of people who have
been abducted, and the one common denominator seems to be the blood line,
and its the blood line that goes back to ancient Indian or Native American
blood lines.



DA: Are these people looking for genetic material?



AC: Well, I don't know if it is a very ancient blood line that they want to
try and stop, or what the reasoning is. I know that I was asked some
questions, like how I was capable of doing some of the psychic things I was
doing at the time. But, it is very unusual to find anybody that remotely
thinks they have been taken that doesn't have the Indian blood line,
somewhere.



DA: Now, after that experience, what happened after that? What were some of
the other times you saw some of these beings?



AC: Well, at that facility I saw the almond-eyed Greys, but the thing that
sticks in my mind are the beings that look like reptiles, or the
veloci-raptors. They are the cruelest beings you could ever imagine, and
they even smell hideous. There were a couple of very unusual areas down
there where I was taken which looked like cold storage lockers, where these
things were in hibernation tubes, and that is about all I remember, other
than seeing some black helicopters and little round-wing disk type
aircraft. At that point, the memory seems to be cut off and I can't tap
through to anything else. They're there, folks.



DA: Maybe I'll open up some phone lines, and maybe we'll talk about Al
Bielek and some things you discussed with him. Are you open to that?



AC: Sure.



Caller (C): On those ships where the Germans and Americans were, did they
have any kind of an insignia on their uniforms?



AC: Yes, they did. I have been told that the organization is called "The
Black League" (possibly the "Black Monks" within the NSA who reportedly
interact directly with aliens? - Branton); by people that might know. A
blue triangle with a red-eyed black dragon, with a circle around it. It was
very unusual. There's another woman that has written a book about an
encounter she had in Fort Walden. I met her some years back, and we were
taking about things we've seen. She also talked about this strange
insignia. She and I both sat down a drew what we saw, and they were
virtually carbon copies of each other. (Note: Winged serpent symbols have
been observed by several abductees, including policeman Herbert Schirmer
who reported the insignia on the uniforms of the reptilian-eyed grays that
had abducted him. - Branton)



In the book "Cosmic Conflict", the author talks about the ancient city that
was uncovered by the Germans before World War II, and tells about their
effort to revive some frozen humans they found in this underground city,
and that the true humans couldn't be revived, but the ones that could be
revived were in fact reptilians in disguise, and the reptilians have the
capability to do shape-shifting and create a [laser] holographic image so
when you look at them you see a human, but under that there is no human
there. It's like a "deja vu" of the movie "They Live". (Note: An early
newsletter called THE CRYSTAL BALL published information along this line,
which stated that the Soviets had during the investigation of a meteor
crash uncovered a buried city in Siberia where they discovered the frozen
bodies of both humans -- who could NOT be revived, and human-appearing
reptilians -- who WERE revived from the frozen state. Allegedly the
reptilians re-animated and killed the Soviet scientists and through some
type of psychic osmosis drained their minds and assimilated their memories
and features through a molecular shape-shifting type process. John
Carpenter, who directed THEY LIVE, also directed an earlier movie called
THE THING which was based somewhat on a similar theme. The alien
'impostors' then called for backup and more scientists came out and were
'replaced', and these eventually returned to Russia and began to infiltrate
the Communist government. Although such claims may seem preposterous, it is
nevertheless interesting how numerous 'preposterous' claims as this contain
identical 'reptilian' themes. Aside from the instinctive and basic racial
fear in humans of things 'reptilian', could this re-occurring theme be more
than mere coincidence? - Branton) Cathy O'Brien, who wrote
"Trance-Formation in America", revealed that George Bush projected a
hologram that he was a reptilian .... real crazy stuff, but if this
technology that they possess is there, why couldn't a race do something
like that ... these 'people' that are working with our government?



C: I believe that, but I do believe that these are demons that manifest
themselves as alien beings, and that this has been going on for a long
time...



DA: Demons? Who are demons?



C: Fallen angels.



DA: The reptilians look like that anyway. All the scriptures around the
planet talk about serpent beings (or in the case of Judeo-Christian
scriptures like Genesis chapter 3 and Revelation chapter 12, serpent beings
possessed by 'demons' or through which demons are able to or allowed to
'incarnate'. - Branton) What do you think, Alex?



AC: Well, I think that's pretty much what the bottom line is. Also, they
talk about the rapture...



DA: It could be like an alien 'thanksgiving'.



AC: These people that have done all this research and are part of the
underground government are telling that the humans on this planet have been
at war with these reptilian aliens for thousands of years. At one point,
things got so hot on the planet, like it is now, aliens took on this
holographic image and infiltrated the human race in order to take it over
and undermine it, just like this New World Order is doing right now.
They're saying that the same thing happened to civilization on Earth
before, and that the humans before actually had the capability for
interplanetary travel, and that it was so bad here with the reptilians that
they had to leave... What they are also saying is that these beings that
are human-looking that are visiting our planet, at this time, trying to
inform people what is going on, and guide them, are actually OUR ANCESTORS
THAT ESCAPED FROM EARTH before, when it was under reptilian domination.



DA: What is your take on these crop circles?



AC: Oh, the crop circles that are the real ones are a type of geometric
language containing some kind of information. There was one that was a
Mandelbrot fractal. How do you fake that? They say that there are a lot of
crop circles going on in the United States, and that the government shuts
the information off (or destroys the crop circles before the public can
find them, others claim. - Branton) about their occurrence.



DA: Canada and Australia as well.



C: It seems that we are having an increase in these encounters and
sightings.



AC: Things are escalating at an incredible rate. I think a lot of these
movies in the media are trying to get us softened up for what they plan to
unleash on us.



C: So, in just a matter of years, they plan to bring it out and bring
people to that airport?



AC: You know, Reagan said more than once that the only thing that would
bring people together would be some kind of "outside force".



DA: Exactly, I remember that. He said that several times.



AC: I went to South Florida a couple of weeks ago and interviewed a man who
had done research for 30 years, and oddly enough, he tapped into some of
the same information I had, in that our government has had round-winged,
saucer-type technology, high mach speed aircraft since the 1920's, and that
in 1952 they had over 500 of these aircraft hidden in secret bases. Now, if
they had that in 1952, considering that military technology grows by 44
years for every year that goes by, what do you imagine they have now, 44
years later, after technology has advanced the equivalent of 1,936 years?



C: About two or three months ago, I went to do a business transaction with
a fellow I have known for about two or three years, and one of his
relatives had just died -- we were pretty close, and we got into a deep
conversation about stuff, and he told me he worked in an underground
military base in Colorado. I asked him what he did there, and he said that
if he told me he'd have to kill me. I told him I didn't want to know. I was
really shocked, and didn't know what to think of it, and then I heard this
program. I want to know what your guest thinks about the Iron Mountain
report the government did in the 1960's, and if that ties into the Nazis
and the Americans [CIA] working together. Also, this would also explain
George Washington's vision where this country was invaded from the East by
a foreign power, and then when all hope seemed lost, the angels of God
would come down and the nation would be saved. Anyway, I never could
understand why angels of God would come down and fight with men to save a
puny little country that has been around for only 200 years, but in this
scenario, there seems to be some explanation here.



AC: Yes, the Iron Mountain report. The guy that claims to be the author of
it now claims that it was nothing more than a joke, but for a joke, it
seems to be following the time line to the hilt, so I think it was
something that made its way out and they are trying to cover that up.
Everything that was in that report is happening in great detail right now.



C: Do these reptilians bleed if they get shot?



DA: Has anybody ever killed one?



AC: Phil Schneider did. He killed several of them. When he was involved in
cutting some tunnels at Dulce, he was lowered down a shaft and ended up in
a nest of these things. He and some of his team were in there, and some of
the Delta Force came in. They had a shootout with these aliens, and he
killed a couple of them before they got a round off and shot him with some
sort of laser weapon. He used to pull his shirt up and show me where they
darned near blew a hole in his chest with whatever kind of laser weapon
they were using.



DA: So they can be killed, then?



AC: Yes, if you have the drop on them. They die just like everyone else.
They consist of mass just like we do.



C: It is interesting that high officials in the Clinton administration,
like Cisneros, were deeply involved with the construction of this airport.
Also, Pat Shroeder. All of a sudden, she's leaving office. It's like a lot
of people who have been involved with this airport are leaving town. Also,
there is a fellow by the name of Rodney Stitch, who writes about the total
corruption in the Denver area. Does this tie in with what you were talking
about?



AC: Well, he is the one that wrote the book "Defrauding America". He said
that they had a tape of a CIA agent paying off the mayor of Denver to get
the airport built. There is just so much corruption. They are selling the
good American people out. We have some of our own people selling the rest
of population out for a few pieces of gold.



DA: What about Al Bielek and how what he is saying may relate to this?



AC: I met Al about a year ago.



DA: Who is Al Bielek?



AC: He claims to be one of the ones who jumped overboard off the Eldridge
when it went into hyperspace during the Philadelphia Experiment. He
actually traveled forward in time, and asked the people that he encountered
there what happened in his future. At that time, he was given the
information about the New World Order and that Denver was the location for
the NWO Western Sector, and that Atlanta was supposed to be the control
center for the Eastern Sector. Can it be that the fact that the Olympics is
supposed to be in Atlanta is part of a scenario? All the highways in
Atlanta have high-security monitoring cameras just like those seen in some
of the underground areas at the Denver airport. These monitors are all over
the interstate highway and on many of the streets in Atlanta. Last week, I
was talking to a fellow who was actually working on the Olympic project, in
terms of the main stadium, and he said that they're gearing up for the
possibility of terrorist acts. Do they know something we don't know?



(Note: As for 'Denver' being the center of a New World Order control system
in the west, we should realize that the future is not fully SET. It IS
subject to change. There are, according to contactees, different 'parallel
realities' that exist. The 3rd dimensional or 3rd density reality is the
'foundation' upon which all others exist. Other realities exist in 4th, 5th
and other 'densities' wherein objects and events are somewhat more 'fluid'
than in 3rd dimensional reality. Many who claim to have traveled in time
state that while doing so they were out-of-phase somewhat with the people
within the other time-zones. They could observe them yet were 'invisible'
or in a phased-out state, in essence unable to 'interfere' to the point of
changing 3rd dimensional past events. Others, involved in the Montauk
project for instance, state that the 'futures' that they observed were of a
quasi-reality or semi-dreamlike nature, as if 'future' reality was like wet
clay that had not yet 'set' and solidified into a CONCRETE reality. So if
this is the case, then Denver does NOT necessarily have to be a New World
Order control center, even though the 'thought forms', or what you might
call 'reality blueprints', ARE being created by the secret government and
are in the process of 'solidifying' as the future gets closer. However, ANY
thought form can be destroyed and replaced BEFORE it solidifies into 3rd
density concrete reality. Those living within the 3rd density event-flow
have the POWER to determine the outcome of events through their connection
to the eternal NOW, just as a large river has first priority over the
smaller tributaries in determining the course of a river bed. So then we
are living in an eternal NOW which is continually in the process of being
converted from a FLUID thought form state and into CONCRETE material form
state. Once 'set', an event cannot be undone. However if there is even a
minimal amount of malleability left to the event, then that event can
potentially be turned... for better or worse. - Branton)



DA: Maybe they want to go ahead and perpetrate something again. One thing
after another. It's all part of their scenario. Let's take a call.



C: Yes, I would like to thank you and your guest for coming forward with
this information. And, as unbelievable as it is for the audience, I
personally have had first-hand experience with some of this stuff. Not so
much with the reptilians, but when you talk about this technology base that
the government is working with, my own encounters with this technology were
basically terrifying, in that I didn't know what was going on. I got
indoctrinated into some type of mind control program that was perpetrated
on me. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's amazing to me that
this stuff is going on, and I know that it is frustrating to get people to
wake up to this. I am a little nervous here. It runs a little deeper than
just on a physical level of threat. I think a lot of this stuff is not just
about suppressing our minds and will to resist the government. It's about
getting our minds to the point to where we're so "droned down" that we have
no chance of reconnecting with the source. I think this whole thing has to
do with us on a soul level.



AC: That's right. That's what it's all about. It's the last great adventure
to control the space between our ears and to eventually take over our
souls. I also think that a lot of the people who have sold us out and are
involved in this have no idea what the BIG picture is, because it is all so
compartmentalized. This is a very demonic scenario that is going on here.



C: That is why I will spend the rest of my days trying to bring this to
people's attention. My take on it is that if you don't make the cut when
all of this comes to a climax, and they do achieve that ultimate control,
your chances of reconnecting are delayed indefinitely.



AC: Well, you know, we have some beings that are waiting for people to ask,
en masse, for help, and they are there, and they will help, but we have to
ask for help, because they honor free will.



C: My previous experience was pretty nightmarish, but I did get through
this, and my perspective on God is a gift.



DA: Alex, how do we get a hold of your book, "Pandora's Box"?



AC: You can write to PANDORA'S BOX, 2663 Valleydale Road, Suite 126,
Birmingham, Alabama 35224. "Pandora's Box - Volume One" is $50 [$80
Overseas], and "Pandora's Box - Volume Two" is $35 [$65 Overseas]. The book
called "The Cosmic Conflict" is $40 [$75 Overseas]. These are big books,
with lots of information.



DA: Well, Alex, thank you for being here, and we'll have you back here
again.

TODD J. VS. THE GRAY EMPIRE:



(Recently a friend of mine related an unusual experience involving an
abduction to an underground system southeast of Denver. I personally
believe that his experience supports Alex Christopher's claim of a vast
underground network under the D.I.A. area. This individual, Todd J., has
experienced abductions by the Grays ever since he was a child. In later
years he and a friend by the name of Mike traveled to Nevada to investigate
Area 51, and while there witnessed an unusual orange object in the sky that
they could not identify through conventional means. While staying in a
motel room on the way back from their experience, Todd had the following
experience - Branton):



"...I opened my eyes and saw someone standing beside the bed. A faint blue
light surrounded the personage which appeared to be a gray colored 'man'
with a big head and large black almond-shaped eyes. It reached out and
GRABBED my hand and all of a sudden the room changed into some type of a
laboratory with strange computers and screens. The alien spoke to me, and I
sensed he was trying to 'show' affection towards me. He called me The
chosen One. I expressed I have had it with you guys, I told you before to
leave me alone, you are not good and can not make me believe you are good.
The being explained that I was chosen as a Prophet and he spelled out on a
paper a new name for me. I read the name and it said Enoch. I told him that
God may have chosen me but not you, and not in this manner. You can not
deceive me, I know what you are and what you are doing, and you have no
right to take me from my bed at night against my will. The being replied,
'You do not realize what you are saying, we are also creations of God and
are good. We shall show ourselves to the world soon and then you must
decide what to do'. I got angry and commanded the alien in the name of
Jesus Christ to take me back. All of a sudden the strange room was filled
with a bright white light and I was taken into it. The next morning I awoke
with a slight headache and a nose-bleed...



"Here is an experience I had with the underground...



"The most unusual abduction I have had so far occurred in May of 1993. I
remember first being inside a UFO high above the earth, not remembering how
I got there. I was standing on a circular silver pad with two grays beside
me -- it reminded me of the teleporter room you see on Star Trek. I could
not move and I noticed my hands were bound by some sort of metallic device.
I saw the front of the room turn into a type of window and we were looking
down over the earth, but I could not see any stars. The gray at the control
panel was moving its hands back and forth but there did not seem to be any
dials on the panels just holes and places to put their hands. The larger
gray beside me held up his arms and we flew down to the earth at a great
speed. We then appeared to be flying over a city, which reminded me of
Denver. We flew south-east to a deserted area with some mounds and the
ground opened up and the entire craft went down into the earth. We rapidly
went through some type of tunnel and then finally came to a stop.

"A door opened to the left of us and a strange light poured into the craft.
I noticed that above the door were some strange glyphs - like some form of
altered Egyptian. I could move my legs and the larger gray directed me
outside the craft with two smaller grays. We were in a very barren place
full of dirt -- the sky appeared unusually orange and gray as if it was
some type of artificial light. I saw a building with the initials MJ upon
it and was greeted by three peculiar looking men dressed in black. The men
told me that they were MJ 1, 2 and 3. I at that time did not know what it
stood for. I was then turned about and taken down a cavern entrance until
we came to some very huge ancient looking doors. The grays waved their arms
and the doors opened.

"Inside was one of the most beautiful places I ever had seen. It was an
underground city paved with marble and gold. There was abundant plant life
and lots of water. I saw many people walking about dressed in white robes
and they were all busy doing something. I was taken into a palace type
building and we came to a throne.

"The throne turned around towards me and I was face to face with a strange
looking man. It appeared to be half human -- half alien. It was quite huge,
and was clothed in a crimson robe. Its eyes were large and black but had
pupils. It had almost full lips and a nose. It wore a crown of some sort.

"It then spoke to me telepathically. 'Greetings Todd, The chosen one, we
have awaited your arrival.' I inquired 'The chosen one? Chosen for what?'
It explained that they had chosen me to join their people and that I was a
prophet to lead them. They would give me great powers -- every power I had
ever dreamed of -- I could fly, I could tell the future, I could heal the
sick and travel through time. I got angry and said 'I am a servant of Jesus
Christ and the only power I need is the priesthood of God. If I was meant
to have the things of which you speak then God would show them to me in his
due time. Now I ask for you to let me go -- you have no right to do this to
me.' The being then said that God had made them also and that God had sent
them to tell me these things. This made me even more upset, because it
seemed they would have told me that in the first place if they were really
from God. Instead they did not mention that until I said I was a servant of
God. So I commanded them in the name of Jesus Christ to let me free. In
which the being tapped the metal bands on my wrists and they flowed like
mercury into the shape of a ball into his hand. He then bowed his head and
told us to depart.

"The two small grays took us back to the entrance. I looked around one last
time and the people were looking at me with confused faces and a bit of
interest in me. Who ever they were I had a desire to HELP them and to know
what they were doing here. But I wanted to leave and as we were walking
away back toward the cavern entrance one of the grays asked me if I was
sure I was making the right decision. I affirmed I knew I was. I asked it
if it knew Jesus Christ, and it seemed to be AFRAID of the word and
affirmed he did NOT know him. I got angry and picked up the gray and threw
it against a wall until it collapsed. I was about to try and turn back to
the PEOPLE when I felt a buzz on my neck and everything went black. When I
came to I was back in my bed..."



Todd's anger was apparently sparked as a result of the smaller Grey saying
it did not know Jesus Christ / God when the large being had implied that
they DID, and that they were operating under His orders. It would seem that
deception was used here. This anger may also have been a response on Todd's
part to years of violation by the Grays of his free agency. Some believe,
and I tend to agree, that the Greys have to have some kind of 'open door'
to manipulate a person's life. It may not necessarily be an 'invitation',
but a 'crack' in the psyche that the Greys could exploit in order to get a
person to open themselves up to their influence. The Greys are apparently
determined to look for ANY loophole. The individual abductees themselves
might be encouraged into capitulating their will over to the Greys through
alien deception and trickery. However the 'open door' might also be -- as
in the case of a child -- a result of a 'foothold' the aliens have
established in the minds of a parent, a religious leader, or political
leader in whom the child trusts... someone who HAS surrendered parts of
their body, mind or spirit to the alien influence. For instance a parent
might buy the lie that the Greys are benevolent 'space brothers', a
religious leader could accept the lie that they are 'angelic beings', a
politician might see them as an other-planetary political force that must
be appeased and negotiated with at all costs, and so on. From these people,
the influence might 'trickle down' to the children under their care. This
would explain why generational abductions seem to be occurring in many
families over many generations.

We must remember that alone however, a typical Gray is not nearly as
intelligent as a human being. Their overall intelligence comes from the
alien group or collective mind, since they operate as part of a 'hive' type
of mentality. Some believe that this group-mind is, in turn, controlled by
invisible entities associated with the fallen angelic factions which have
since ancient times been incarnating through the reptilian races for the
purpose of using these entities as physical 'channels' through which they
are able to carry out their purposes in the physical domain. This may
explain why the Grays have knowingly and blatantly lied to abductees and
attacked traditional spiritual belief systems by making such claims as the
following: "We genetically created the human race" [the result, we must
acknowledge them as our 'gods']; or, "We created Jesus Christ" [this is
interesting, especially when we consider that Jesus of Nazareth verbally
blasted and condemned the 'serpent' race as being in league with Satanic
forces, on more than one occasion]; and in the case of Todd's experience...
that he was a "Chosen One". Thousands of abductees have been told that they
are the supreme spokesperson for the aliens on earth, or specially chosen
for some mission. In other words they gain their followers the same way
Adolph Hitler did -- by stroking their egos: "YOU ARE THE MASTER RACE,"
etc., etc., ad nauseum. And it would seem that in the same way that many
'religious' leaders claim to be the SOLE spokesman for God on earth --
these contactees, abductees or mediums consider themselves to be the sole
voice of the aliens. I would suggest that you do not respect any HUMAN who
claims to be the 'sole spokesman' of God, not unless they are able to back
up their claims by living a perfectly FLAWLESS life. All of this has
contributed to the overall division and animosity which exists among
various UFO research groups. Playing on human ego's is apparently a
time-tested and very effective way for the Grays to gain the trust and
cooperation of humans on, within or beyond the planet earth.

Following are additional experiences that were related by Todd J, beginning
with an incident that occurred while he was still a child. While looking
through UFO books in a school library in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, Todd
experienced a disturbing flashback:



"...I came across a drawing of an alien made by a little boy who said he
saw one in his back yard. It was the exact same thing I saw in [a] dream
when I was little, it shocked me so much that I immediately closed the book
and left the library.

"Then it started to happen, at night I would always have a strange feeling
of being watched while I slept. Sometimes the FEAR became so intense that I
couldn't sleep, which would result in me sleeping-in the following morning
and skipping school. Then the weird stuff started. I began to wake up at
night and see balls of light floating around in the darkness and I couldn't
move, so I just closed my eyes. Then one night I got up to go to the
bathroom and for some reason I felt I needed to go look in my brother's
room. When I looked in I saw that face in the window, the big black eyes,
the round head and slanted chin. It freaked me out because we lived in a
two story house. I ran to my room and hid under the blankets.

"The following nights I would pray about it and asked God to protect me.
Then as I laid in bed after everyone was asleep I started to hear buzzing
from outside the window. An extreme fear came over me and I couldn't move
and I couldn't yell for my parents. An eerie green light started to fill my
bedroom from outside and then I would somehow just wake up the next morning
not remembering anything after the green light. I would usually have a
severe headache, a sore throat, or feel extremely tired and drained of all
my energy.

"After about three or four nights of this I knew it would probably happen
again, and it did. This time I prepared myself... When the green light
entered the room, my body was paralyzed. I tried to call upon Heavenly
Father to cast it out of my room but I could not speak, my jaw was really
tight. So I prayed in my head when all of a sudden I saw that the
wood-grain on my bedroom door appeared to be forming into the face of man
with a beard and long hair. I thought it was Jesus Christ. Then a bright
white light came from above me and chased the green light away. As soon as
this happened I had control of my body and I immediately pulled the covers
over my head, I had no idea that God would actually do such a great thing.
I then heard a voice which was so calm and loving saying to me 'You are
safe now Todd, you may go back to sleep.' And I peeked through the blankets
and saw a man in white clothes standing beside my bed. I was still a little
frightened but I felt peace and that the terror was over...for now.

"...It was the Thanksgiving of 1992, my grandmother and uncle had come up
for Thanksgiving dinner and to spend the day with us. During the day my
grandmother started talking to me about aliens for some reason and I
started telling her of the things I had seen when I was little.

"Then that night I remember being awaken by a noise, I first noticed that
my computer monitor was reflecting a bright green light and then my whole
room was filled with a bright green light. My first thought was, 'Oh no,
they're back!' Then I again was paralyzed as it had happened to me when I
was twelve. I was looking out my bedroom window and I stared face to face
with a gray alien. There were two more behind him. I tried to yell but
again my jaw was tight and my tongue was stiff. It just looked at me with
those scary big black eyes liked it looked into my soul. I felt evil and
fear, I am surprised I did not release my bowels! Then the light consumed
me and I was drawn out of my bed into the light. While this was happening I
was praying in my head and all of a sudden I was walking down the street in
front of my house with an angel.

"This angel was a magnificent looking man. He was about seven feet tall and
the bright white light around him was as pure as freshly fallen snow and it
radiated about the entire front yard like a morning sunrise. His face was
gentle and happy and his eyes looked at me lovingly. His whole countenance
was just amazing beyond description.

"He placed his hand upon my shoulder and pointed toward the house. I looked
over to my bedroom window and saw the three beings still at my window
hovering above the ground in a bright green beam of light which seemed to
be coming from nowhere. The angel stayed by my side and protected me. I
tried to cast the small gray aliens away with my priesthood but they were
still there (Todd at this time was a member of the Mormon religion, and
tried to respond to these 'evil' creatures according to how he had been
'taught'. - Branton). I was so angry, the things that had made my life
miserable since I was a child now there within my view, and I saw how weak
they were, how small. And I thought 'These beings are so small, yet their
power is enough to stop me in my tracks.'

"But this time I was FREE, this time I could harm them and I did. I ran to
one and grabbed it by the neck and started to strangle it. I could feel its
spine coming through the back of its neck as it let out a horrible
screeching noise.

"They were not very tall, only about four feet high -- but they hovered in
this light up to my height until they were next to my face. Their skin was
like a reptile's, cold and leathery. Their damn eyes got to me the most...
big black liquid eyes, just two holes for a nose and barely a mouth, just a
slit. Their bodies were not very proportional as ours are. Their arms hung
down a little past their knees, and their heads seemed too large for their
neck to support it.

"The angel just stood by as I went into a rampage and killed all three of
them. They were so fragile. The angel smiled as if I had done the right
thing. And we then proceeded to lay the dead bodies on the lawn. I watched
the green light fade away and saw no light except the brilliant radiance of
the angel's. The angel knelt down at the bodies which seemed to be changing
from gray into a sick yellowish color. I watched as the angel opened his
robes and unsheathed a golden sword and began to cut away the tops of the
beings' heads and their brains came out in an upper and lower section.

"The angel arose and spoke, 'Behold, they are nothing to us. They are
nothing but creatures of evil.' Then a blue light or conduit from the sky
actually transported them into small balls of light and took them away. So
I have no evidence that I actually killed them. We, the angel and I then
entered the house, and in the kitchen were three more aliens. One came up
to me with a long shiny metal rod that seemed to have a laser beam coming
out it. The alien stuck it in the left side of my neck and it stung really
bad and then I could not move, so the angel touched me and I could move
again. I then immediately punched the alien square in the face breaking its
neck and killing it instantly. The other two stood by looking at their
fallen comrade -- their moves were very quick and their heads rotated
almost as fast as a lizard. The angel held up his arms and spoke. 'In the
name of Jesus Christ I command you to depart.' Then both the creatures
immediately fell to the floor and these gray aliens were again taken up
into a beam of light in the same manner as before.

"Then the angel covered my eyes and then uncovered my eyes. I was all of a
sudden on top of a large mountain looking down over a large valley FILLED
with aliens and strange looking humans and their spacecraft. Then I saw
hundreds of people dressed in white walking on the mountain with us as if
they had come to watch. And then a voice from heaven said 'Behold, these
evil ones have perverted the ways of the Lord and deceived many and
fornicated with my children. They shall have no place in my kingdom nor in
this world to come.' Then a FIRE came down from the sky and CONSUMED all
the beings and all the strange human[oids] and all the UFOs and nothing was
left. The angel then spoke saying I had seen enough and he again placed his
hand over my eyes. I awoke from my bed and it was morning.

"Later in that year even in the same month I noticed a scar in the shape of
a circle that I never had before. I couldn't recall how it got there but
one day when my mom asked me how it got there I had a flashback of when the
alien stuck that silver rod in my neck. Now I had proof that I've seen
them!

"On this SAME NIGHT of November 22, 1992, there was a UFO crash on Long
Island, New York which was supposedly shot down by the government with a
plasma cannon. I have seen the pictures of the small gray alien captured at
the crash site and it was exactly the same type that abducted me."



Note: All of this brings to mind the controversy over the 'material'
aspects of UFO encounters vs. the 'supernatural' aspects. It would seem
from the above, as well as from other sources, that the 'Greys' for
instance are both physical as well as supernatural beings... or rather
malevolent spirit-entities utilizing or possessing physical alien 'bodies'.
In a sense you could say that the same holds true about humans themselves:
we are physical-soular-spiritual beings, we possess 'blood plasma' which
contains both physical AND spiritual essence -- which may be why the Greys
are so interested in human 'blood' by the way.

Although traditional 'Greys' have a strong collective mentality in addition
to a [gross] spiritual and physical nature, they have no 'soul'. Since
supernatural forces play a major part in alien operations against humans on
earth, humans must develop their SPIRITUAL defenses as well as their
intellectual and physical defenses, since the Greys attack on all three
levels of our beings through what might be described as a form of
psychotronic techno-sorcery.

One must be careful not to open oneself to their influences however. There
is a growing number of quantum physicists who are beginning to realize that
there is a 'spiritual' side to science. At the lowest sub-atomic levels the
physical laws of 'logic' seem to break down into what might be referred to
as 'etheric' or 'spiritual' laws that do not necessarily apply to physical
laws, or what many spacefaring cultures refer to as 'Divine Geometrics' or
the 'laws of spirit' at work behind the 'laws of physics'. So it is
difficult to find where the electromagnetic realm ends and the etheric
realm begins. This is the very basis of the OCCULT TECHNOLOGY that is being
developed within the Dulce base, it is SUPERNATURAL TECHNOLOGY, a deadly
form of Techno-Sorcery. This who attempt to resist the Greys will soon
discover that the conflict they have become involved with is not just a
spiritual one, and not just a physical one, but a warfare that is in fact a
FUSION of material and spiritual realities.

Most people do not realize that our modern 'science' has largely developed
from the occult-sciences of the past, or the 'Alchemists'. So who can say
exactly where science ends and the supernatural begins? Apparently at least
with much of the UFO phenomena, the exact distinction may be very hard to
find. Does this mean that technology and the supernatural are 'evil'? Not
necessarily, for the physical 'forces' of the universe and the supernatural
'forces' of the universe can be used by our physical and spiritual natures
respectively for either good or evil. Being that we are of a
spiritual-psychic-physical nature, we as humans possess abilities that we
can not begin to understand. In this cosmic battle there are no 'neutral'
forces. In other words we can NOT utilize these spiritual-psychic-physical
abilities in a 'neutral' way or believe that we are in ultimate control of
these abilities ourselves, since there are intelligence's which are so
powerful in this universe that to them we appear as mere 'pawns' who can be
manipulated for their own use. The important thing is not for the pawn to
'realize its own pawnhood', but for each of us to consider which 'player'
has our best interests at heart. I definitely believe that one of the
'players' is much more benevolent than anything we can imagine, and the
other is far more malevolent than anything we can conceive. I believe that
we must DECIDE which side of the cosmic battle we will serve, and this all
comes back to the old fundamental reality that we have known all along:
will we commit our spiritual-psychic-physical abilities to 'God' [good] or
to the 'Devil' [evil]? To the Almighty, who desires to establish a universe
of perfect harmony, order, truth and love; or to the collective rebel
angels and their alien 'puppets' who desire only to devour and consume
everything around them like the 'spiritual black holes' that they are?

There are more and more reports coming my way, like the one that appears
above, which strongly suggest that in spite of the physical and tangible
aspects of many of the aliens [Greys, Reptiloids, etc.], the true powers
that must be contested are the motivating supernatural entities which
possess and incarnate many if not most of these soulless 'aliens', simply
because at some point in the past these 'aliens' themselves submitted to
the complete control of these supernatural beings. They rejected the
universal law of respecting the Divinely-established sovereignty of other
beings, whether on an inter-planetary, inter-national or inter-personal
basis. In violating the sovereignty of others they themselves lost their
own personal sovereignty, liberty or independence. They chose to ally
themselves with members of a collective 'hive' mind which assured them that
it was right to violate the sovereignty of other beings, and that it was
logical for the 'collective' to assimilate all things under its control
even if the individuality of those assimilated was all but destroyed. So in
joining with a force which advocated the conquest of other 'sovereignties',
they in turn forfeited their own.

Will our human race be the next race to be 'assimilated' by these astral
parasites and the corrupted physical alien races under their control? I
believe the decision is entirely and individually up to us.
