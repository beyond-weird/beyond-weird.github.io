                    DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY

This has been a carefully-planned fifty-year war. The late 40s and 50s were
spent putting their agents in place and rebuilding their main clients'
European industrial base -- with American money. The initial steps in the
American overthrow occurred in the 1960's through several of the Group's
most critical agents -- Earl Warren and LBJ, with assists from J. Edgar
Hoover and others. [Chief Justice Warren, unlike LBJ, was an unwilling
agent. The Group forced Warren to participate in the JFK cover-up and the
Group's plan to alter the social structure of US because they "had
something on him."] One of the first things the Group did to protect its
own covert operation was one of Gen. Gehlen's specialties in WWII Nazi
intelligence -- divert attention to the "Red menace." There is also a
pattern of identifications by my informant of petitioners and/or their
chief lawyers in a series of Supreme Court cases in the 1950s and 1960s
that made it impossible for the Fed or state governments to conduct
thorough investigations into subversive organizations. While I applaud the
civil liberties aspects, I suspect that this was only 'window dressing' for
the true purpose.

What the Group wanted by the time of the "incubation period" [1995-2000]
was a society that was uneducated, amoral, uncommitted to democratic
institutions, living in fear, with a sudden and very drastic reduction in
spendable income simultaneous with societal chaos. The Group thought that
this would produce the environment for 'rejection' of the democratic form
of government that they seek by 2000. In the 1960s the Group's agents
started the process of eliminating religious and moral ideals from American
life, particularly in the schools [& in that regard go back & read the
dissents in the Supreme Court cases, accurately stating that the Founding
Fathers would turn over in their graves to learn that what they wrote in
Philadelphia in the 1780s outlaws prayer in schools], removed as many
impediments to criminality as they could get away with, dramatically
increased media [TV] portrayal of violence and joblessness [role models
have no jobs, bad guys live in big houses, etc.; begin your reading with
'The Early Window', by Liebert & Sprafkin], reduced the standards of
education and early training for rational thought and fostered every
possible dislocation in family structure they could engineer, beginning
with LBJ's welfare policies...
