                 RUDOLPH HESS AND SECRET GERMAN SPACE BASE

Rudolph Hess, Hitler's best friend and second in command, went to England
to try to stop the war with Britain and was arrested as a "war criminal" on
May 10, 1941 and was kept from having any contact with the public until he
was recently murdered. He was the only prisoner in Spandau prison. Ones who
paid any attention to his situation at all have wondered what was the big
secret he knew that made him so dangerous to the Allies? Perhaps the answer
is revealed in [Christof] Friedrich's book "Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions"
on page 34: Hess "was entrusted with the all-important Antarctic file...
Hess, himself, kept the Polar File..."

If you look at a map of Antarctica you will see that a portion of Queen
Maud Land is called New Schwabenland. This is the part of the continent
nearest to South Africa. The Germans made a major expedition to this area
in 1938-1939 and began the construction of a major base. For details of
this expedition, see the book by Friedrich. This book has pictures of the
"warmwater" [geothermal] ponds and other information that will surprise
you. It has maps showing that Admiral Byrd's Operation Highjump [Naval Task
Force 68] military invasion landed on the side opposite the German bases...
The maps of Operation Highjump say that they left the German side of the
continent 'unexplored'.

A man who was very influential in modern German post-war politics was
Hans-Ulrich Rudel, a frequent guest speaker in German military and
political circles. Rudel was the man groomed by Hitler to become his
successor. It is known that Rudel made FREQUENT trips to Tierra del Fuego
at the tip of South America nearest Antarctica. One of Martin Bormann's
last messages from the bunker in Berlin to Doenitz mentioned Tierra del
Fuego...

A book called "America's Aircraft Year Book" tells about the U.S. using
captured German scientists at Ft. Bliss and Wright Field. "Among those in
the German group at Wright Field were Rudolph Hermann, Alexander Lippsisch,
Heinz Schmitt, Helmut Heinrich, and Fritz Doblhoff and Ernst Kugel. Hermann
was attached to the Peenemunde Research Station for Aerodynamics, where
Germany's V-2 rockets were hatched and launched against England. A
specialist in supersonics, he was in charge of the supersonic wind tunnel
at Kochel in the Bavarian Alps. He also was a member of the group entrusted
with Hitler's futuristic plans to establish a space-station
rocket-refueling base revolving as a satellite about the Earth at a
distance of 4,000 miles -- a scheme which he and certain high-ranking AAF
officers in 1947 still believed to be feasible."

Later evidence shows that most or all of the [air] craft and 'flying
saucer' scientists (who were not captured - Branton) disappeared. The
available evidence indicates they went to South America or Antarctica.

The "El Mercurio" and "Der Weg" papers told of a large submarine convoy
discovered by the British Navy at the end of WW II. All available Allied
units engaged the convoy and were totally destroyed except for the Captain
of one destroyer, who was reported as saying, "May God help me, may I never
again encounter such a force."

On July 10, 1945, more than two months after the end of the War, the German
submarine U-530 surrendered to Argentine authorities. The Commander was
Otto Wermoutt. The sub had a crew of 54 men [the normal sub crew was 18
men] and the cargo consisted of 540 barrels of cigarettes and unusually
large stocks of food. The Commander was 25 years old, the second officer
was 22, and the crew was an average of 25 except for one man who was 32
years old. This was an unusually young crew and upon questioning it was
learned that they all claimed that they had no relatives.

A map from a Spanish book called "Is Hitler Alive?" with the route of the
Fuhrer convoy shows it passed alongside South Georgia Island, where later a
secret underground base was the focus of a secret battle during the
Falkland Islands War.
On April 4, 1944 at 4:40 a.m. the German submarine U-859 left on a
mysterious mission carrying 67 men and 33 tons of mercury sealed in glass
bottles in watertight tin crates. The sub was sunk by a British submarine
and most of the crew died. One survivor on his death bed about 30 years
later told about the expensive cargo and some divers checked out his story
and found the mercury. For what purpose was this mercury to be used? And
where were they trying to take it? (apparently mercury is theoretically
usable as a fuel source for certain forms of aerospace propulsion. -
Branton)

There are many other stories of other U-boats and German survivors, mostly
in the Southern Hemisphere. The Germans and other European nations required
very meticulous registration records of everybody, including their
relatives, employment, addresses, children, etc., and at the end of the war
the Allies, cross checking these records, taking into account casualties
and deaths, determined that THERE WERE [AT LEAST] 250,000 PERSONS
UNACCOUNTED FOR... (That's a quarter of a MILLION, by the way. - Branton)
