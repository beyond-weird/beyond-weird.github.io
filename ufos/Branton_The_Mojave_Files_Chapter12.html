"Dahl's boss, FRED L. CRISMAN (he also owned the boat), became a central
figure in the mystery. DAHL HIMSELF VANISHED SOON AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH
ARNOLD, and the efforts by later investigators (such as Harold T. Wilkins,
a British author) have failed to locate him. Crisman had been A FLIER IN
WORLD WAR II, and he was suddenly RECALLED into the service in 1947, FLOWN
TO ALASKA, and later stationed in Greenland. In recent years amateur
sleuths engaged in investigating the alleged conspiracy to assassinate
President John F. Kennedy have tried to implicate CRISMAN. District
Attorney JAMES GARRISON of New Orleans subpoenaed one FRED LEE CRISMAN of
TACOMA, WASHINGTON, to testify before the Grand Jury listening to
Garrison's evidence against Clay Shaw (Jim Garrison was portrayed by Kevin
Costner in the popular motion picture "JFK" - Branton), according to wire
service stories in November, 1968. Crisman was identified as a radio
announcer, but Garrison's investigations implied that HE WAS EITHER A
MEMBER OF THE CIA OR HAD BEEN 'ENGAGED IN UNDERCOVER ACTIVITY FOR A PART OF
THE INDUSTRIAL WARFARE COMPLEX.' He allegedly operated under a cover as a
preacher and was 'engaged in work to help Gypsies.' These stories caused a
chain reaction in UFO circles, since UFO believers have long accused the
CIA of being somehow connected with the flying saucer mystery. Of course,
the CIA was in its infancy in 1947 at the time of the Maury Island case and
was then largely staffed by NAVAL personnel from World War II intelligence
units.

"Clay Shaw was tried early in 1969, accused by Garrison of having conspired
to murder President Kennedy. He was found innocent and freed. The exact
nature of Crisman's testimony before the Grand Jury IS NOT KNOWN. He did
not testify at the actual trial...

"The Maury Island case fell apart in Arnold's hands. The slag samples given
to him by Dahl and Crisman WERE SWITCHED BY SOMEONE; two investigating Air
Force officers, Brown and Davidson, WERE KILLED WHEN THEIR PLANE CRASHED
shortly after leaving Tacoma; DAHL VANISHED; Crisman was literally exiled
to Greenland for two years; Tacoma newsman Paul Lance, who helped Arnold in
his investigation, DIED SUDDENLY A SHORT TIME LATER. Palmer claims that a
cigar box filled with original slag samples WAS STOLEN from his Chicago
office soon afterwards.

"At one point Ted Morello of the United Press took Arnold aside and told
him:

     "'You're involved in something that is beyond our power here to
     find out anything about... We tried to find out information at
     McChord Field (the Tacoma Air Force base) and drew a blank, and
     we have informants there who practically smell the runaways for
     news... We've exhausted every avenue attempting to piece what has
     happened together so it makes some sense... I'm just going to
     give you some sound advice. Get out of this town until whatever
     it is blows over.'

     "Arnold got into his private plane and headed for home. He
     stopped in Pendleton, Oregon, to refuel, and shortly after he
     took off again, HIS ENGINE STOPPED COLD. Only quick thinking and
     expert flying saved him from a serious crash..."

Yet another apparent 'casualty' of what appears to be a cosmic warfare
between Man-kind and certain 'Draconian' forces of darkness, was described
in a letter addressed to SEARCH Magazine, which appeared in it's September,
1960 issue:

     "Dear Rap (i.e. Raymond A. Palmer):

     "I have been following your pursuits of UFO(s)... through your
     magazines for some time with consuming interest, especially the
     Shaver Mystery. There's an item or two concerning this that I
     have been intending to write you about for some time. Some- times
     during the year about 1946 to 1947 I heard that Dr. William
     Beebee wrote an article published in the 'Atlantic Monthly' in
     which he made a remark about 'the coming invasion of the earth by
     the underground race.' When I remarked on this to a fellow worker
     of mine he said 'Isn't he the scientist-oceanographer who
     disappeared?' I was startled by his sudden question and said that
     I didn't know, and asked if he knew anything of the circum-
     stances surrounding his disappearance. He said he understood or
     heard that on one of Dr. Beebee's descents to the ocean floor OFF
     THE COAST OF FLORIDA, he was missing from the inside of the
     diving bell when it was brought up! Do you have anything on this?
     I had been wanting to look for some corroboration of this to see
     if it could be true or if the present whereabouts of William
     Beebee is known. Then I am reminded of the disappearance of
     another prominent person, the world traveler and explorer Richard
     Halliburton. I am sure I read only a few years ago that he was
     presumed to be lost at Sea in a storm...."

The number of 'casualties' keep pouring in...

In his book 'THE UNDERPEOPLE' (1969. Award Books., N.Y.), author Eric
Norman relates an interesting account of a 'disappearance' of another sort,
involving the possible fate of the Inca Indians of South America. In
chapter 2 -- 'Strange Caverns and Terrifying Tunnels', he relates:

"Conquest in South America (involved) natives hacked to death by Spanish
swords, arrogant priests absolving Conquistadors for their murderous
atrocities, sharp Toledo steel lances running through children and,
pervading it all, a dark lust for native gold.

"In the autumn of 1582, Francisco Pizarro hid his 168 Spanish horse
soldiers behind the doorways and walls of the Incan town of Cajamarca.
Atahualpa, the absolute emperor of the sun- worshipping Inca's empire, had
agreed to meet Pizarro in the village plaza. Atahualpa's procession entered
the village with a flair of pageantry. Incan warriors and the emperor's
litter bearers were dressed in the finest cloth. The Royal Guard were armed
with spiked helmets, feathered war clubs, poison-tipped lances and dazzling
gold-inlaid swords. Thick gold bracelets encircled their bronze wrists and
rich silver discs dangled from their pierced ear lobes.

"Pizarro and his Conquistadors remained hidden behind their guns and
cannons as Atahualpa and his entourage entered the main plaza. 'It is like
leading hogs to the killing pen,' Pizarro sneered. The bandy-legged
Spaniard knew hogs; prior to his service for Spain's king, Pizarro had been
a swineherd in the province of Estremadura. He lived by a harsh personal
code that equated kindness with weakness; deceit was the trick of a clever
man and lying, duplicity and thievery were proper.

"Atahualpa's group stirred nervously when they found no sign of the
visitors to their land. Spanish fingers twitched on gun triggers and a
hawk-faced soldier stood ready to torch the cannon. Suddenly, a solitary
figure left a building and walked into the plaza. He was dressed in the
faded robe of a Dominican (Roman Catholic) friar. His bald head glistened
contemptuously toward the Incan emperor.

"Friar Vincente Valverde announced that all of South America now belonged
to the king of Spain. He stared coldly at the emperor and snapped, 'The
Papal Bull of 1493 provides this right...'

"Proud and regal, Atahualpa glared at the haughty friar before him. 'Your
POPE must be CRAZY to give away land that does not belong to him,' he
said...

"The friar was stunned momentarily, then he turned and ran toward the
safety of a building, shouting: 'Pizarro, attack, attack! Kill all of them!
I will absolve you!'

"With hoarse cries of 'Santiago!', the Spaniards slaughtered the
unsuspecting Inca warriors. In a few minutes the battle was over; the
emperor's royal guard was dead, or dying, in the bloodstained dust of the
plaza and Atahualpa was a prisoner of Pizarro. Greedy Spanish hands ripped
the emerald necklace from his body. A wild gleam entered Pizarro's eyes
when the emperor handed over his exquisitely carved bracelets of thick
gold.

"'I want my freedom,' Atahualpa informed Pizarro. 'I will fill this room
with gold for ransom.' The room was 17 feet wide and 22 feet long! The
emperor's subjects delivered $8,443,456 in gold to Pizarro and, afterward,
Pizarro and Friar Vincente Valverde condemned Atahualpa to be burned alive
at the stake.

"While the Spaniards were burning the emperor, a pack train of 11,000
llamas was headed toward the Spanish encampment. Each beast was burdened by
a heavy load of gold. Native messengers brought news of the Inca king's
death -- and the fantastic caravan disappeared! During the past centuries,
thousands of gold-greedy adventurers have searched for the 'loot of the
11,000 llamas.' None has discovered a single clue to the treasure's site.

"Believers in the Under-People theory are firm in their contention that the
Incan llamas disappeared into a gigantic tunnel that led to the inner earth
kingdoms. 'Even the population figures show that these conquered people
outwitted their bestial conquerors,' according to one South American
researcher. 'Incan census figures reveal that there was 10,000,000 subjects
when the Spaniards arrived. Forty years later, in 1571, the Spaniards took
a census. There was approximately 1,000,000 Indians. I admit that the
Spanish method of slave labor took a tremendous toll. But could 9,000,000
Incas have died in Spanish mines?'"

Eric Norman relates the words of one correspondent who described the
ancient subterranean tunnels, pre-dating the Incan Empire itself, that were
believed by many to exist beneath the Andes:

"'...at first I scoffed at such stories about mysterious tunnels and an
alien civilization beneath the surface... I joined an inner earth group for
the simple enjoyment of discussing outlandish ideas in a humorless, serious
manner. Gradually, I became interested by the considerable volume of
circumstantial evidence. I now believe the earth is absolutely honeycombed
by a web of tunnels that run beneath the continents, under the oceans, and
these passageways link the subterranean cities of the inner world.

"'...There are many reports concerning a vast tunnel called the 'Roadway of
the Incas' which has an entrance somewhere in Peru. It runs south more than
a thousand miles. There is another entrance to this fabulous tunnel in the
Desert of Atacamba in Chile. The 'Highway of the Incas' passes under Cuzco,
the legendary city of Peru. There is another, smaller, but very well hidden
entrance to the tunnel in the mountains near Machu Picchu, which is the
capital city of the first and last Inca emperor. It is called 'The Lost
City of the Incas' and was not discovered until 1911 by an American, Hiram
Bringham. It is considered the 'Eighth Wonder of the World... everything at
Machu Picchu is in excellent preservation.'

"His mention of the 'Highway of the Incas'," Eric Norman continues,
"strikes a familiar note... A physician in Argentina has devoted his spare
time to an investigation of this legendary inter- continental tunnel of the
Under-People. He commented:

"'...I have always been intrigued by the unknown and please convey my
thanks to Dr. H---- for providing the opportunity to publish my views... I
started to investigate the 'Highway of the Incas' when I was a young,
curious youth and I have hundreds of witnessed, notarized statements. These
documents and tape recordings fill one room of my home. The Incas knew of
the tunnel and, although gold was of little value to them, they hid their
treasures in these caverns to keep it from the greedy Spanish conquerors.
No one had provided a satisfactory explanation for their mysterious
disappearance. There was an empire of several million people that vanished
from the surface of the earth. They entered the tunnel and left the Quechua
Indians behind. As few Incas have been seen since then, they possibly took
up residence in a cavern city or followed the tunnel to the interior of the
earth.

"'...The 'Highway' is the largest of the tunnels and it connects all
continents. In addition to the openings in South America, there are
entrances in Canada, in British Columbia; in America, you should
investigate Mt. Shasta in California and Mt. St. Helena in Oregon. The
tunnel is connected with Tibet and another opening in Central Asia. I
believe the African entrance is in the Atlas mountains in the north of that
continent.

"'...I also suggest that you explore the 'highways' which have been found
in the oceans. These ancient underworld civilizations may be mining our
seas!'"

Alexander Von Humboldt, in his volume 'VIEWS OF NATURE' (London, Henry G.
Bohn, 1850) relates on pp. 412-413 the following account which he collected
while in Cuzco, Peru:

"...The son of the Cacique Astorpilca, an interesting and amiable youth of
seventeen, conducted us over the ruins of the ancient palace. Though living
in utmost poverty, his imagination was filled with images of the
subterranean splendor and the golden treasures which, he assured us, lay
hidden beneath the heaps of rubbish over which we were treading. He told us
that one of his ancestors once blind-folded the eyes of his wife, and then,
through many intricate passages cut in the rock, led her down into the
subterranean gardens of the Inca. There the lady beheld, skillfully
imitated in the purest gold, trees laden with leaves and fruit, with birds
perched on their branches. Among other things, she saw Atahuallpa's gold
sedan-chair (UND DE LAS ANDAS) which is alleged to have sunk in the basin
of the Baths of Pultamarca.The husband commanded his wife not to touch any
of these enchanted treasures, REMINDING HER THAT THE PERIOD FIXED FOR THE
RESTORATION OF THE INCA EMPIRE HAD NOT YET ARRIVED, and that whosoever
should touch any of the treasures would perish that same night.

(Note: This may or may not be the same as the legendary underground 'garden
cavern' below the 'fort' of Sacsahuaman near Cusco, referred to by other
sources. Through that cavern is said to flow a large under- ground spring,
a vast chamber which can only be entered by navigating a confusing
labyrinth of underground tunnels. This account would also seem to tie-in
with various rumors that not only the Inca treasures, but many of the Incas
themselves escaped the Conquistadors through ancient tunnels which led to
vast cavern cities built in antediluvian times by the lost 'Atlantean'
race. There are actually people who claim to have met these subterranean
'Incas'. One person who claimed to have been descended from the Incas
themselves, told the former editor of AMAZING STORIES magazine Raymond A.
Palmer, that he had encountered one of these ancient 'cousins' of his who
acted as a sentry or guard of an entrance to one of the underground abodes.
This entrance was in the form of a shaft which was situated on the top of a
mountain peak hidden somewhere in the Matto Grosso region of Brazil. The
sentry, who spoke to the man through a transparent partition near an
elevator shaft that descended into the depths, stated that he and his
family could enter their abode if they so wished, but that they would have
to undergo a decontamination process to remove the radioactive pollutants,
contaminants and infections that their bodies had acquired from a lifetime
of living in the outer world - Branton)

"These golden dreams and fancies of the youth," Humboldt continues, "were
founded on recollections and traditions transmitted from remote times.
Golden gardens, such as those alluded to (JARDINES O HUERTAS DE ORO), have
been described by various writers who allege that they actually saw them;
viz., by Cieza de Leon, Parmento, Garcilaso, and other early historians of
the Conquista. They are said to have existed beneath the Temple of the Sun
at Cuzco, at Caxamarca, and in the lovely valley of Yucay, which was a
favorite seat of the sovereign family...

"The son of Astorpilca assured me that underground, a little to the right
of the spot on which I then stood, there was a large Datura tree, or
Guanto, in full flower, exquisitely made of gold wire and plates of gold,
and that its branches overspread the Inca's chair. The morbid faith with
which the youth asserted his belief in this fabulous story, made a profound
and melancholy impression on me."

The following account appeared on page 52 of the Nov. 1954 issue of FATE
magazine. The article was titled 'GATE TO THE UNKNOWN':

"In March, 1954, a French Jesuit priest in Sorata, Bolivia, told a strange
story of an exploring trip he had made in the cavern of San Pedro on 20,000
foot Mount Illampu of the Andes chain.

"The cavern must be entered on all fours through a narrow passage which
widens after a few yards and leads into an immense cavern filled with
stalagmites and stalactites. At one end of the cavern is a subterranean
lake.

"The French priest claimed to be the first person to cross to the far end
of the lake. After several HOURS of rowing a small boat by artificial
light, he related, the cave narrowed and gave way to a trail barred by an
enormous gate of wrought iron. The grille, he said, bore all the
characteristics of 17th century Spanish ironwork.

"The priest tried unsuccessfully to break through the barrier. He was eager
to see what lay beyond but he had to return to Sorata without solving the
mystery."

The question one might ask in this case is: Did the early Spanish explorers
of this cavern go through all the trouble to forge the gate in order to
keep someone out, or did they do it to keep some 'thing' in...?

SERIA DOCUMENTAL DEL PERU, a Peruvian newspaper describes an expedition
which explorers from Lima University, accompanied by experienced
speleologists, undertook in 1923. After entering a tunnel in or near Cuzco,
Peru, the explorers lost communication with the point of entry. After 12
days only one member of the expedition, almost starved, returned to the
surface. But his report of a confusing labyrinth was so incredible his
colleagues declared him mad. Police prohibited entry into the mysterious
passage and dynamited the entrance to prevent further loss of life.

In his book 'THE GOLD OF THE GODS', Erich von Danniken relates some
interesting thoughts concerning an ancient tunnel system that had been
discovered below the mountains and jungles of Ecuador, which reportedly
consist of straight 'glazed' tunnels with intermittent 'air shafts' that
stretch for hundreds of miles. Although he has come under criticism from
many researchers for his tendency to embellish certain accounts, and twist
certain archeological and historical facts in an attempt to support his own
theories, some of his research is nevertheless interesting and reliable
enough to include here. On pp. 59-60 of this particular work, he stated:

     "...I can refute the objection that the tunnel-builders must have
     'betrayed' themselves by the enormous quantities of debris
     excavated while making the tunnels. As I credit them with an
     advanced technology, they were presumably equipped with a THERMAL
     DRILL of the kind described in DER SPIEGAL for 3 April, 1972,
     which reported it as the latest discovery. The scientists of the
     U.S. Laboratory for Atomic Research at Los Alamos spent a year
     and a half developing the thermal drill. It has nothing in common
     with ordinary drills. The tip of the drill is made of wolfram and
     heated by a graphite heating element. There is no longer any
     waste material from the hole being drilled. The thermal drill
     melts the rock through which it bores and presses it against the
     walls, where it cools down. As DER SPIEGAL related, the first
     test-model bored almost soundlessly through blocks of stone 12
     ft. thick. At Los Alamos they are now planning the construction
     of a thermal drill that is powered by a mini atomic reactor and
     eats into the earth like a mole, in the form of an armored
     vehicle. This drill is intended to pierce the earth's crust,
     which is about 25 miles thick (on the average - Branton), and
     take samples of the molten magma that lies underneath it..."

A Navaho Indian legend speaks of ancient migrations involving a cavernous
realm below the four corners areas. The Hopi's speak of a similar legend
involving an alleged opening, sometimes described as a hill and sometimes
as a 'pond', covering the path to the cavern world. The Hopi 'emergence'
point is called the 'Sipapu' or 'Sipapuni' and is said to be near the
confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. According to the
Hopi tradition not all of the people who dwelt in the cavern world came up
with them. Others chose to remain below. As for the Navajos, they state
that:

     "At one time all the nations, Navajos, Pueblos, Coyoteros, and
     white people, lived together, underground in the heart of a
     mountain near the river San Juan. Their only food was meat, which
     they had in abundance, for all kinds of game were closed up with
     them in their cave; but their light was dim and only endured for
     a few hours each day...

     "Then the men and the animals began to come up from their cave,
     and their coming up required several days. First came the
     Navajos, and no sooner had they reached the surface they
     commenced gaming at patole, their favorite game. Then came the
     Pueblos and other Indians, who crop their hair and build houses.
     Lastly came the white people, who started off at once for the
     rising sun and were lost (from) sight...for many winters.

     "While these nations lived underground they all spoke one tongue;
     but (with) the light of day and the level of the earth came many
     languages..."

If there is even a grain of truth to this ancient legend, then it would
seem that the caverns in which the southwestern Indians formerly and
allegedly lived were void of the nefarious influence of the reptilian
hominoids. Although the reptilians may have moved in later, some Hopi
sources state that their people were actually forced to the surface by the
sudden invasion of the serpent people or reptilians from caverns beyond. We
will make one comment, and that is the amazing coincidence between this
legend and the more modern accounts of cavernous labyrinths below this very
same region of the Four Corners. As they say 'Where there's smoke there's
probably fire.' Most of the accounts that refer to subterranean conflicts
between human and reptilian forces within the compartmentalized world of
the cavern systems state that the warfare within that realm is overt and
deadly real. Reports of whole human tribes or communities within the
caverns being wiped-out by sudden and unexpected attacks from reptilian
forces are not uncommon in "Inner Earth" literature. Out in the "open"
surface world, however, these draconian forces must work in secrecy and
engage in covert attacks and psychological warfare since the outer world
has not yet been subjected to the point where there will be minimal
resistance to an overt invasion. However, the reptilians have had much
success in programming, implanting and buying-off human political,
intellectual and spiritual leaders who are all too willing to do the will
of their alien "bene- factors" in exchange for the "Trojan Horse" promises
given by the serpent race. These human collaborators are members of all
those secret societies that are tied-in with the conspiratorial hub of the
BAVARIAN EMPIRE or ILLUMINATI [aka the BILDEBERGERS] -- the Thule Society,
Vril Society, Nazi Party, Knights of Malta, Knights Templar, Jesuit Order,
Black Nobility, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission,
Scottish Rite, Skull & Bones, Ordo Templi Orientis, etc.

Migration legends concerning vast caverns are not restricted to the
southwest however. Many of the Indians of the southern states and New
England in fact repeat this same theme almost verbatim. Nor should we limit
such accounts to North America, since they are found profusely throughout
the world.

If the Navaho's did in fact migrate through the cavern world from some
distant land, then could they have 'emerged' from the caves with their
neighboring Hopi Tribesmen?

Harold Courlander, in his book 'THE FOURTH WORLD OF THE HOPIS' described an
ancient Hopi legend about an underworld. Whether or not the account is
accurate, it nevertheless shows that the POSSIBILITY for the existence of
such a 'world' was and is foremost in the minds and legends of many native
American tribes.

Courlander describes the Hopi legend which states that the Hopi ancestors,
before their 'emergence' to the surface world, migrated through different
cavern regions until they came to the 'third' cavern world -- or the realm
below the general 'Four Corners' area of the Southwest, a series of caverns
that were very extensive and in which crops were able to grow to some
extent. Life there eventually became very oppressive for the majority of
the Hopis when a few of their numbers turned to practicing sorcery, making
it very difficult for the rest. The 'peaceful' Hopi's later left this
cavern world (in an attempt to escape the influence of the sorcerers who
were collaborating with the advancing reptilian forces?) on a journey which
took several days, leaving the sorcerers below. If true, this does not
necessarily mean that all Hopi ancestors who remained below are presently
collaborating with the reptilians. Dr. Hank Krastman, who claims to have
been allowed into an underground "Hopi" city below the Grand Canyon
beginning in 1960 and beyond, states that those humans he encountered there
were presently at war with the Grays. The surface Hopis themselves have
legends of those who have re-visited the ancient traditional site of
'emergence'. Some suggest that the 'Sipapu' is covered by a mound, while
others hold that a small pond seals the entryway to the cavern world.
Whatever the case, most Hopis agree that the ancient site is somewhere near
the convergence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. As Courlander
reveals on pp. 213-214 of his book:

"...The story of the journey to Grand (Salt) Canyon to transfer the salt
deposits to that place conforms to an account given in the 1930s by Don
Talayesva or Oraibi, as recorded in Mischa Titiev's article, 'A Hopi Salt
Expedition' (AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, vol. 39, 1937). That account contains
detailed reference to all the shrines and sacred spots along the salt
trail, and the ritual observations at those places. The legend primarily
belongs to the Third Mesa villages -- Oraibi, Hotevilla and Bakavi (Bocobi)
-- and to Moencopi, an offspring of Oraibi. In former times these villages
sent expeditions to Grand Canyon to gather their salt. According to the
belief of some Third Mesa clans, Grand Canyon contains not only the sacred
salt beds and shrines, but the sipapuni through which mankind emerged from
the Third (Lower) World. As Titiev paraphrases the description given by Don
Talayesva:

"'It was not long before the expedition found itself approaching THE Kiva,
the original SIPAPU through which mankind emerged from the underworld. Its
outlines are indicated by soft, damp earth and an outer circle of bushes
called pilakho... Pushing their way through the fringe of vegetation, the
party stepped into the inner ring within which the Kiva is located. The
sipapu is full to the brim with yellowish water, of about the same coloring
as the surrounding earth, which serves as a 'lid' so that ordinary humans
may not see the wonderful things going on beneath the surface.'

"The Walpis and other First Mesa people do not agree that the sipapuni is
at that place, asserting that its location is no longer known. The salt
myth given here is not part of First Mesa belief. Walpi customarily sent
its salt expeditions to Zuni in the south- west. In recent years, of
course, virtually all Hopi salt expeditions have been to the nearest
trading posts..."

It may be a coincidence, then again maybe not -- but an early issue of the
'HOLLOW HASSLE' newsletter reported one woman's belief (she did not state
where she got her information) that within caverns a mile-and-a-half
beneath the surface of northern Arizona and New Mexico lies the remains of
one of the most ancient human civilizations on (or rather, within) the
earth.

In a letter dated January 28, 1991, Norio F. Hayakawa added the following
comments concerning the 'Dulce' facility and it's possible connection with
the 'Mystery of Iniquity' of Bible prophecy:

"...I've been to Dulce with the (Japanese) Nippon Television Network crew
and interviewed many, many people over there and came back with the firm
conviction that something was happening around 10 to 15 years ago over
there, including nightly sightings of strange lights and appearances of
military jeeps and trucks. And I am convinced that the four corners area is
a highly occultic area. The only stretch of highway, namely Highway 666,
runs through the four corners area from southeast Arizona to North- western
New Mexico and up. I have also heard that this Highway 666 came into
existence around 1947 or 1948, fairly close to the time of 1947, the
modern-day beginning of OVERT UFO APPEARANCE, i.e. the Kenneth Arnold
incident, and coincident- ally or not, the establishment of Israel in
1948."

Paul Bennewitz sent out a letter on June 6, 1988 describing 'PROJECT BETA',
which referred to the alien base in New Mexico (near Dulce - pronounced
'Dul-see'), the lower extremities of which are reportedly inhabited by the
Grays, the Reptons and the Draco. NASA CIR film was allegedly useful in
locating this base and revealing U.S. (or rather 'secret government')
Military involvement with the 'Greys'. Another group called the 'Orange' is
said to be based below the west slope of Mt. Archuleta near 'the Diamond'.
Some suggest that the 'Orange' are a so-called 'hybrid' race with PARTIAL
reptilian-like features yet possessing human-like reproductive organs and
even certain artificial or cybernetic features. It is possible that the
'Orange' consist of hu-brids and re-brids in that some or most of them may
possess a human soul- matrix and therefore may be 'human', although
information on the 'Orange' is presently scetchy. They have also been
described as being involved in the scenarios taking place in the tunnels
below the Nevada Military Complex as well.
William Cooper briefly mentioned the 'Orange' based on memories of top
secret documents he had read while in Navy Intelligence:

     "...there were four types of aliens mentioned in the papers. A
     LARGE NOSED GREY (Reptoids? - Branton), a blond human like type
     described as the NORDIC, a red haired human-like type called the
     ORANGE. The homes of the aliens were described as being a star in
     the Constellation Orion, Bernard's star, and Zeta Reticuli 1 & 2.
     I cannot remember even under hypnosis which alien belongs to
     which star." (Note: Zeta Reticuli is most often associated with
     the Grays. The 'Orange' -- which sources seem to indicate 'may'
     actually be a double term used to describe two different types of
     entities, a reptilian hominoid group with scaly orange skin and a
     more human-like group with 'red' hair -- may have established
     themselves in Orion or Bernard's Star. Contactee Hal Wilcox
     allegedly has experienced interaction with HUMANS based near
     Bernard's Star, although he did not describe them as particularly
     "Nordic" appearing. Orion has long been associated with
     imperialistic human and predatory hybrid reptilian- insectoid
     cultures, excluding the Orion "Nebula" itself which lies hundreds
     of light years BEYOND the Orion open cluster and has been
     identified as a "gateway" to an infinite realm beyond the
     physical universe, or the abode of the angelic forces and the
     Supreme Being).

"...There were over 650 attendees to the 1959 Rand Symposium." 'Commander
X' related in one of his reports. "Most were representatives of the
Corporate-Industrial State, like: The General Electric Company; AT&T;
Hughes Aircraft; Northrop Corporation; Sandia Corporation; Colorado School
of Mines, etc.

"Bechtel (pronounced BECK-tul, a San Francisco - base organization -
Branton) is a supersecret international corporate octopus, founded in 1898.
Some say the firm is really a 'Shadow Government' -- a working arm of the
CIA. It is the largest Construction and Engineering outfit in the U.S.A.
and the World (and some say, beyond).

"The most important posts in the U.S.A. Government are held by former
Bechtel Officers. They are part of 'The Web' (an inter- connected control
system) which links the Tri-lateralist plans, the C.F.R., the Order of
'Illuminism' (Cult of the All-seeing Eye) and other interlocking groups..."

"MIND MANIPULATING EXPERIMENTS... The Dulce Base has studied mind control
implants; Bio-Psi Units; ELF Devices capable of Mood, Sleep and Heartbeat
control, etc.

"D.A.R.P.A. (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is using these
technologies to manipulate people. They established 'The Projects,' set
priorities, coordinate efforts and guide the many participants in these
undertakings. Related Projects are studied at Sandia Base by 'The Jason
Group' (of 55 Scientists). They have secretly harnessed the Dark Side of
Technology and hidden the beneficial technology from the public.

"Other Projects take place at 'Area 51' in Nevada... 'Dreamland' (Data
Repository Establishment and Maintenance Land); Elmint (Electromagnetic
Intelligence); Cold Empire; Code EVA; Program HIS (Hybrid Intelligence
System): BW/CW; IRIS (Infrared Intruder Systems); BI-PASS; REP-TILES, etc.

"The studies on Level Four at Dulce include Human Aura research, as well as
all aspects of Dream, Hypnosis, Telepathy, etc. (research). They know how
to manipulate the Bioplasmic Body (of Man). They can lower your heartbeat
with Deep Sleeve 'Delta Waves,' induce a static shock, then reprogram, Via
a Brain- Computer link. They can introduce data and programmed reactions
into your Mind (Information impregnation -- the 'Dream Library').

"We are entering an era of Technologicalization of Psychic Powers... The
development of techniques to enhance man/ machine communications;
Nano-tech; Bio-tech micro-machines; PSI-War; E.D.O.M. (Electronic
Dissolution of Memory); R.H.I.C. (Radio-Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control);
and various forms of behavior control (via chemical agents, ultrasonics,
optical and other EM radiations). The Physics of 'Consciousness.'...

"SURVIVING THE FUTURE... The Dulce Facility consists of a central 'Hub.'
the Security Section (also some photo labs). The deeper you go, the
stronger the Security. This is a multi-leveled complex. There are over 3000
cameras at various high-security locations (exits and labs).

"There are over 100 Secret Exits near and around Dulce, many around
Archuleta Mesa, others to the source around Dulce Lake and even as far east
as Lindrich.

"Deep sections of the Complex CONNECT INTO (EXTENSIVE) NATURAL CAVERN
SYSTEMS.

"...INSIDE THE DULCE BASE... Security officers wear jumpsuits, with the
Dulce symbol on the front, upper left side (the Dulce symbol consists of an
upside-down triangle with an inverted "T" superimposed over it -
Branton)... The ID card (used in card slots, for the doors and elevators)
has the Dulce symbol above the ID photo. 'Government honchos' use cards

The Feb.-Mar. 1991 issue of 'UFO UNIVERSE' carried an article titled 'THE
DEEP DARK SECRET AT DULCE', written by Bill Hamilton and 'TAL' LeVesque. We
are sure the reader will agree that the following article serves to
tie-together much of what has been revealed earlier in this file. If planet
earth is the main 'battleground' for the final cosmic conflict, and the
U.S. is one of the major areas on earth where the 'final outcome' may be
decided, and since the Dulce or New Mexico subnet is considered to be the
MAJOR site where reptil-saurian activity is taking place (an alien 'empire'
in conflict with various 'human groups' based in California and elsewhere,
with the Nevada subnet itself being a major 'battlezone') then we should
focus our attention not only on what has been going on within the Nevada
Military Complex and its sub-branches in Utah and Idaho, but also on what
has been taking place in the subterranean complexes deep below the small
southwestern town of Dulce itself.

More than any other area in the U.S., if not the world, this small town has
been the epicenter of nearly every form of para- normal and top-secret
activity one can imagine, including: UFO sightings, UFO landings, top
secret CIA and Air Force activity, experimental Aircraft, secret Special
Force operations, High-Tech Research, Abduction scenarios, implantation's,
Human & Animal mutilations, PSI warfare studies, Secret Government-Alien
interaction, armed conflict between human and alien forces, sightings of
Grays, Reptilians and 'Mothmen', Underground bases and construction
activity, conspiracy scenarios, alien infiltration of human society,
deep-cavern phenomena, unusual Native American legends, MIB or Men In Black
encounters and other activity related to the above. In fact a higher
CONCENTRATION of such activities has been evident in the vicinity of Dulce
than most other areas in the world, even to the point that the inhabitants
of this town have, for the most part, resigned themselves into accepting
the reality of such activity -- whether they like it or not.

Bill Hamilton and 'TAL' LeVesque take us deep 'inside' the Hadean-like
labyrinthine depths of this underground megacomplex through the eyes of
those who have been there:

"...Dulce is a sleepy little town in northern New Mexico. It's population
is about 900 and it is located above 7,000 feet on the Jicarilla Apache
Indian Reservation. There is one major motel and just a few stores. It is
not a resort town and it is not bustling with activity. Yet, according to a
few outsiders, Dulce harbors a deep, dark secret. That secret is said to be
harbored deep below the tangled brush of Archuleta Mesa. That secret
involves a joint government-alien biogenetic laboratory designed to carry
out bizarre experiments on humans and animals.

"New Mexico State Police Officer Gabe Valdez was drawn into the mysteries
of Dulce when called out to investigate a mutilated cow on the Manuel Gomez
ranch in a pasture 13 miles east of Dulce. Gomez had lost four cattle to
mutilations between 1976 and June 1978 when a team of investigators which
included Tom Adams arrived from Paris, Texas to examine the site of the
carcass.

"Curious as to how cattle were being selected by the mysterious mutilators,
an interesting experiment was conducted on July 5, 1978 by Valdez, Gomez,
and retired scientist Howard Burgess. The three penned up about 120 of the
Gomez beef cattle and moved them through a squeeze chute under an ultra-
violet light. They found a 'glittery substance on the right side of the
neck, the right ear, and the right leg.' Samples of the affected hides were
removed as well as control samples from the same animals. Some
investigators attribute the mutilations to aliens from UFOs. Sightings of
strange lights and other aerial phenomena have been reported in many areas
where the cows have been found at the time of the reported mutilation. UFOs
have been seen frequently around Dulce.

"I arrived in Dulce on April 19, 1988, to visit with Gabe Valdez and to
inquire about the sightings, the mutes, and the rumors of an underground
alien base in the area. There was still snow on the ground by the Best
Western motel when I checked in and called Valdez. He made an appointment
to see me at 9:30 PM. I found Gabe to be a very congenial host as he
offered to show us around the roads of Dulce that night and point out the
various locations where he had found mutilated cows or had seen strange
aerial lights. He made the astounding statement that he was still seeing
unidentified aircraft at the rate of one every two nights. We took a look
at the Gomez Ranch, the road by the Navajo River, and the imposing
Archuleta Mesa. Gabe had found landing tracks and crawler marks near the
site of the mutes. Gabe was convinced that scientist Paul Bennewitz of
Thunder Scientific Labs in Albuquerque was definitely on the right track in
his attempts to locate an underground alien facility in the vicinity of
Dulce.

"I had first heard of Paul Bennewitz in 1980 when my friend Walter called
me from Albuquerque and told me he had been working with Paul on electronic
instruments. Walter said Paul had not only photographed UFOs, but had
established a communication link with their underground base at Dulce.
Bennewitz had first come to prominence during the August 1980 sightings of
UFOs over the Manzano Weapons Storage Area and Kirtland AFB. A Kirtland AFB
incident report dated October 28, 1980 mentions that Bennewitz had taken
film of UFOs over Kirtland. Paul was president of Thunder Scientific Labs
adjacent to Kirtland. Bennewitz gave a briefing in Albuquerque detailing
how he had seen the aliens on a video screen. The aliens were transmitting
signals... from a base underneath Archuleta Mesa.

"Researcher William Moore claims that government agents became interested
in Bennewitz' activities and were trying to defuse him by pumping as much
disinformation through him as he could absorb. Whether Paul's communication
(or rather his "interrogation" of their mainframe computer core via a
computer- video-radio link - Branton) with supposed aliens at the Dulce
Base was part of this disinformation campaign is unclear. If one were to
believe that Paul is the single source of reports on the Dulce Facility,
then it could also be a tactical maneuver to discount and discredit Paul's
allegation of an underground base if such reports were meant to remain
secret. Then the actual disinformation maneuver would be to dis-inform the
public and not a single individual.

"In a report entitled 'PROJECT BETA' Paul states that he had spent two
years tracking alien craft; that he had constant reception of video from an
alien ship and underground base viewscreen; that he had established
constant direct communications with the aliens using a computer and a form
of Hexadecimal code with graphics and printout; and claims to have used
aerial and ground photo- graphy to locate the alien ship's launch ports and
charged beam weapons. Paul claimed that the aliens were devious, employed
deception, and did not adhere to agreements. Paul and Walter were working
on a weapon that would counter the aliens.

"Some will think at this point that we have crossed-over from the land of
clear thinking concerning anomalous phenomena to the land of
science-fiction. But let us remember that bizarre phenomena such as the
UFOs represent may have its roots in a bizarre reality. It is expected to
be bizarre at first, but as we continue our studies we will evolve to
understand it.

"Paul Bennewitz had investigated the case of abductee Myrna Hansen of New
Mexico who reported having been taken to an underground facility in May
1980. Christa Tilton of Oklahoma has reported that she had an experience of
missing time in July 1987 where she had been abducted by two small grey
aliens and trans- ported in their craft to a hillside location where she
encountered a man dressed in a red military-like jump suit. She was taken
into a tunnel through computerized check-points displaying security
cameras. She reported having been taken on a transit vehicle to another
area where she stepped on a scale-like device facing a computer screen.
After the computer issued her an identification card, she was told by her
guide that they had just entered Level One of a seven-level underground
facility. Christa goes on relating how she was eventually taken down to
Level Five. She reports having seen alien craft and little grey alien
entities in some of the areas that she passed through.

"Christa reports going into one large room where she saw large tanks with
computerized gauges hooked to the tanks and large arms that extended from
some tubing down into the tanks. She noticed a humming sound, smelled
formaldehyde, and was under the impression that some liquid was being
stirred in the tanks. Christa has made drawings of much of what she had
witnessed during her abduction.

"These tanks Christa talks about were depicted in a set of controversial
papers called the Dulce Papers. These papers were allegedly stolen from the
Dulce underground facility along with 30 black and white photos and a video
tape by a mysterious security officer who claims to have worked at Dulce up
until 1979 when he decided that the time had come to part company with his
employers. The rest of the story is about this security officer who has met
with one of us in an attempt to tell us the truth about the aliens, the
U.S. Government (Note: although some sources claim that another
'government' completely separate from our Consti- tutional elected
government is involved with this base, a 'secret' government that is -
Branton), and the Dulce base. He is announcing his intention to come out of
hiding and present soft and hard evidence of his claims. It will be up to
you to decide whether this evidence constitutes an addition to the growing
proof that a government cover-up exists.

(Note: At the time this article appeared, 'Thomas C.' was still an
anonymous individual. More recently the authors have given permission to
state his full name as being Thomas Edwin Castello. The reason for this is
due to 'rumors' that he had passed away in 1994 while hiding out in Costa
Rica. It is interesting that at this time Costa Rica was experiencing one
of the largest UFO flaps of that year in the entire world, one that was
OFFICIALLY RECOG- NIZED by the Costa Rican government. Some suggest that
the UFO's chose Costa Rica because its Air Defenses were minimal and
therefore they were less likely to fire upon their craft. - Branton)...

"In late 1979, Thomas C. could no longer cope with the awe- some reality he
had to confront. As a high level security officer at the joint alien-U.S.
Government underground base near Dulce he had learned of and had seen
disturbing things. After much inner conflict, he decided to desert the
facility and take various items with him.

"Using a small camera, he took over 30 photos of areas within the
multi-level complex. He removed a security video tape from the Control
Center which showed various security camera views of hallways, labs,
aliens, and (secret government) personnel. He also collected documents to
take with him. Then, by shutting off the alarm and camera system in one of
the over 100 exits to the surface, he left the facility with the photos,
video, and documents. These 'originals' were hidden after five sets of
copies were made.

"Thomas was ready to go into hiding. But, when he went to pick up his wife
and young son, he found a van and 'government' agents waiting. He had been
betrayed by K. Lomas (a fellow worker) who was instrumental in the
kidnapping of his wife and child. The agents wanted what Thomas had taken
from the facility for which he would get his wife and son back. It became
apparent to him that his wife and son would be used in biological experi-
ments and were not going to be returned unharmed. That was a little over
ten years ago.

"How did Thomas get involved in all this covert intrigue?

"Thomas is now about 50 years old (i.e. at the time the article was written
- 1991 - Branton). When he was in his mid-twenties, he received top secret
training in photography at an underground facility in West Virginia. For
seven years, he worked for the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, California when
in 1977 he was transferred to the Dulce facility. He bought a home in Santa
Fe, New Mexico and worked Monday through Friday with weekends off. All
Dulce Base personnel commute via a deep underground tube-shuttle system.

"At the time, one of us (TAL) was working security in Santa Fe, M.M. and
was privately investigating UFO sightings, animal mutilations, (and)
Masonic and Wicca groups in the area. Thomas had a mutual friend who came
to Santa Fe in 1979 to visit both of us. This individual would later view
the photos, video tape and documents taken from the Dulce Base. Drawings
were made from what was seen and circulated later in the UFO research
community as the 'Dulce Papers.'

"Thomas alleges that there were over 18,000 of the short 'greys' at the
Dulce Facility. He has also seen (tall) reptilian humanoids. One of us
(TAL) had come face-to-face with a 6-foot tall Reptoid which had
materialized in the house. The Reptoid showed interest in research maps of
New Mexico and Colorado which were on (TAL's) wall. The maps were full of
colored push-pins and markers to indicate sites of animal mutilations,
caverns, the locations of high UFO activity, repeated flight paths,
abduction sites, ancient ruins, and suspected alien underground bases.

"...The security level goes up as one descends to the lower levels. Thomas
had an ULTRA-7 clearance. He knew of seven sub-levels, but there MAY have
been more. Most of the aliens are on levels 5, 6, and 7. Alien housing is
on level 5. The only sign in English was one over a tube shuttle station
hallway which read 'to Los Alamos.' Connections go from Dulce to (the)
Page, Arizona facility, then to an underground base below Area 51 in
Nevada. Tube shuttles go to and from Dulce to facilities below Taos, N.M.;
Datil, N.M.; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Creed, Colorado (where gravity
anomaly maps have shown a large adjacent area of negative density
suggesting massive subterranean cavities below - Branton); Sandia; then on
to Carlsbad, New Mexico. There is a vast network of tube shuttle
connections under the U.S. which extends into a global system of tunnels
and sub-cities.

"At the Dulce Base, most signs on doors and hallways are in the alien
symbol language and a universal symbol system under- stood by humans and
aliens. Thomas stated that after the second level, everyone is weighed, in
the nude, then given a uniform. Visitors are given off-white uniforms. The
weight of the person is put on a computer I.D. card each day. Any change in
weight is noted. Any change in over three pounds requires a physical exam
and X-ray. The uniforms are jump suits with a zipper.

"In front of all sensitive areas are scales built into the floor by
doorways and the door control panels. An individual places his computer
I.D. card into the door slot, then presses a numerical code and buttons.
The person's card must match with the weight and code or the door will not
open. Any discrepancy in weight will summon security. No one is allowed to
carry anything into sensitive areas. All supplies are put on a conveyor
belt and X-rayed. The same method is used in leaving sensitive areas.

"All elevators are controlled magnetically, but there are no elevator
cables. The magnetic system is inside the walls of the elevator shaft.
There are no normal electrical controls. Everything is controlled by
advanced magnetics, including lighting. There are no regular light bulbs.
The tunnels are illuminated by Phosphorous units with broad, structureless
emission bands. Some DEEP TUNNELS use a form of phosphorous pentoxide to
temporarily illuminate certain areas. The aliens won't go near these zones
for reasons unknown (Note: This suggests that these deeper tunnels may have
originally been built by ancient beings other than the reptilians -
Branton).

"The studies on Level 4 include human-aura research, as well as all aspects
of telepathy, hypnosis, and dreams. Thomas says that they know how to
separate the bioplasmic body from the physical body and place an 'alien
entity' force-matrix within a human body after removing the 'soul'
life-force-matrix of the human (or, in more simple terms -- 'kill' the
human being and turn it into a vessel to be used by one of the 'infernals',
'paraphysicals' or 'poltergeists' in order to allow it/them to work and
operate in the physical realm? This appears to be a complex version of the
ancient 'zombie' traditions, if in fact such horrific things are taking
place in this installation. Many have stated that the Antichrist Force,
symbolized by the number '666', is fully at work within the Dulce Base
Network, suggesting that what is in fact involved there may be a
sophisticated form of high-tech Satanism. Incidentally -- according to one
source -- the inter-networking underground systems converging below Dulce
is only PARTIALLY described in accounts such as this. In fact, this source
alleges, the vast extent of the underground mega-complex can actually be
compared to the size of the island of Manhattan! - Branton).

"Level 6 is privately called 'Nightmare Hall'. It holds the genetic labs.
Here are experiments done on fish, seals, birds, and mice that are vastly
altered from their original forms. There are multi-armed and multi-legged
humans and several cages (and vats) of humanoid bat-like creatures up to
7-feet tall. The aliens have taught the humans a lot about genetics, things
both useful and dangerous.

"The Greys, the Reptoids, the winged Draco species are highly analytical
and technologically oriented. THEY HAVE HAD ANCIENT CONFLICTS WITH THE
EL-HUMANS (or 'Anakim'? -- human 'giants' who reportedly maintain
underground and off-planet colonies - Branton) and may be STAGING here for
a FUTURE CONFLICT...

"Principal government organizations involved with mapping the human
genetics, the so-called genome projects are within the Department of Energy
(which has a heavy presence on the Nevada Test Site); the National
Institute of Health; the National Science Foundation; the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute; and, of course, the Dulce Underground Labs 'run' by the
DOE.

"Is the alien and human BIO-TECH being used to nurture and serve us or is
it being used to CONTROL AND DOMINATE US? Why have UFO abductees been used
in genetic experiments?

"IT WAS WHEN THOMAS ENCOUNTERED HUMANS IN CAGES ON LEVEL 7 OF THE DULCE
FACILITY THAT THINGS FINALLY REACHED A CLIMAX FOR HIM. He says, 'I
frequently encountered humans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but
sometimes THEY CRIED AND BEGGED FOR HELP. We were told they were hopelessly
insane, and involved in high-risk drug tests to cure insanity. We were told
NEVER TO SPEAK TO THEM AT ALL. At the beginning we believed the story.
Finally in 1978 a small group of workers discovered the truth. THAT BEGAN
THE DULCE WARS.'

"We may find it hard and unpalatable to digest or even believe Thomas'
story and why should we even give it a hearing at all? Probably for no
other reason than the fact that MANY OTHERS are coming out and telling
bizarre stories and the fact that there may be a terrible truth hidden
behind the continuing phenomena of UFO sightings, abductions, and animal
mutilations. Our govern- ment intelligence agencies have had an ongoing
watchful eye on all UFO activities for many decades now. This bizarre
phenomena must have a bizarre explanation. We may be only one outpost in
(a) vast interstellar drama.

"Recently, researcher John Anderson went to Dulce, N.M. to see if he could
see if there is anything to the reported UFO activity. He says that he
arrived in town coincidentally to see a caravan of cars and a McDonnell
Douglas mini-lab in a van going up a rural road near the town. He followed
them to a fenced-in compound where he waited to see further developments.
Suddenly, six UFOs descended rapidly over the compound, hovered long enough
for him to snap one picture, then shot up and out of sight. When later
stopping in a store to tell the owner of the UFO photo he had taken, the
store owner listened and revealed how he had been a victim cattle rancher
of cattle mutes. Their conversation was interrupted by a phone call after
which the store owner told John to leave at once, then closed the store
after John went to his car. John then saw a mysterious van drive up to the
store and a man got out and went in. John decided to leave Dulce at that
moment but WAS FOLLOWED BY TWO MEN IN A CAR as he left town.

"Even more recently a research team has gone up to Archuleta Mesa to take
soundings under the ground and preliminary and tentative computer analysis
of these soundings seem to indicate DEEP CAVITIES UNDER THE MESA (one
source said that according to the data these cavities extended to a depth
of over 4,000 FEET! - Branton).

"Perhaps, someday, we will discover the deep dark secret of Dulce...
Whatever the future brings it won't be dull."

Gabe Valdez, former State Police officer in Dulce, New Mexico, was
contacted by a certain researcher in 1990, in an attempt to confirm some of
the information which had appeared previously concerning his involvement in
the UFO-mutilation investigations. The following was learned:

"--He and others HAD seen strange flying objects in the area, however he
himself was unsure whether these were 'UFO's' of alien origin, or some type
of top secret aircraft being tested by some secret faction of the
government.

"--Something DID crash near Mt. Archuleta several years ago, but again, he
did not find any evidence conclusively proving whether it was an object of
human OR alien origin.

"--There is another road leading to the Mt. Archuleta area (and mesa) aside
from the one which goes through the Ute Indian reservation. As for the
restricted road that runs south from the Ute Reservation, much of it is in
good condition (paved?). Only the area around the Archuleta region itself
requires four-wheel drive vehicles.

"--He did investigate cattle mutilations, and at least in SOME cases a
known nerve agent was discovered in the carcasses, and other indications
suggesting that the cattle were being used for research in 'D.N.A.'
experiments."

The following document (among others) originated from a U.S. Intelligence
worker who has been missing for quite some time. A nephew of the OSI-CIA
intelligence worker discovered the following (as well as other documents,
many of which applied to the Dulce and Dreamland base systems) in a locker
in which the missing Intelligence agent, a Mr. 'Tucker', apparently kept
some of his papers. The document(s) may have had something to do with his
disappearance, although exactly what connection this might be is uncertain.

Copies of this and other documents eventually ended up in the hands of
several researchers as a result of one investigator who was approached by
the family of the missing agent and given the documents. This source
indicated that this family was extremely disturbed not only about the
disappearance, but about the nature of the documents themselves, and the
role they may have played in connection with the disappearance.

In the copy of the document which is quoted here, some annotations were
made. These seem to have been 'corrections' on the ms. made by Paul
Bennewitz. These will be indicated by an (*):

"SUMMARY OF NOTES TAKEN BY JIM MCCAMPBELL CONCERNING...TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS
WITH DR. PAUL F. BENNEWITZ:

"This is Jim McCampbell making a recording of a remarkable episode on July
13, 1984. It has to do with a UFO base, cattle mutilations, advanced
weaponry, contact with aliens, etc.

"The episode began about a week ago when I received a little semi-annual
periodical titled STIGMATA. It is number 21, the First Half of 1984. This
little bulletin is prepared by Thomas Adams at P.O. Box 1994, Paris, TX
75460...

"He has a rather lengthy article. One finds point of interest on page 9 and
I suppose the only way to pursue this is to read what he has here as it is
fundamental to the entire story.

"Quoting: 'In May of 1980 a most interesting event occurred in northern New
Mexico. An event similar in many respects to the Doraty Case. A mother and
her young son were driving on a rural highway near Cimarron, New Mexico.
They observed two or more craft and as Judy Doraty did, they observed a
calf being abducted. Both observers were themselves abducted and taken on
separate craft to what was apparently an underground installation, where
the woman witnessed the mutilation of the calf. (* Woman witnessed
mutilation in the field -- dead animal taken with them.) It has been
alleged that she also observed a vat containing unidentified (* cattle)
body parts floating in a liquid, AND ANOTHER VAT CONTAINING THE BODY OF A
MALE HUMAN. The woman was subjected to an examination and it has been
further alleged that small metallic objects were implanted into her body as
well as into her son's body. More than one source has informed us that
CAT-scans have confirmed the presence of these implants.

"'Paul Bennewitz, President of his own scientific company in Albuquerque
and an investigator with the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, has
been the principal investigator of the case. Interviewed in his office in
April 1983, Bennewitz reports that through regressive hypnosis of the
mother and child and his own follow-up investigation (including
communications received via his computer terminal which ostensibly is from
a UFO-related source), he was able to determine the location of the
underground facility, a kilometer underground beneath the Jicarilla Apache
Indian Reservation near Dulce, New Mexico. (Since 1976, one of the areas
hardest-hit by mutilations coincidentally or whatever).

"'...The mother and son, by the way, were returned back to their car that
night. Since the incident, they have suffered repeated trauma and
difficulties as they attempt to recover from the episode. We pass this
along because the account is, of course, most crucial if true; but we are
not in a position to confirm the alleged findings. Hopefully, more
information regarding this incident will be aired in the near future. We
can only consider such reports while continuing to seek the evidence to
refute or confirm.'

"That's the end of this remarkable quotation from STIGMATA.

"...I got in touch with Dr. Bennewitz by telephone and indicated that I had
seen this reference to him and his work and I wanted to find out whether he
was being misrepresented or whatever... It is rather mind boggling and here
is the substance of that telephone conversation.

"He is a physicist and he started four years ago to determine in his own
mind whether UFOs exist or do not and he has gotten much more deeply
involved than he ever intended. IT HAS CAUSED HIM A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
FROM THE GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE GROUPS. He has pictures from the location.
He went with a Highway Patrol Officer and they saw a UFO take off from the
mesa at the location. He obtained photographs and what he calls launch
ships were 330 ft. long and 130 ft. across. The cattle rancher named Gomez
and he went back to this location which is a mesa and saw a surveillance
vehicle which was about 5 ft. by 10 ft., like a satellite, he said. He had
been using a Polaroid camera and then got a Hausel-Bladd to produce much
better pictures. He set up a monitoring station and observed that UFOs are
all over the area... He has been dealing heavily with a Major Edwards
(somebody) (* Security Commander) who was with Manzano Security and two (*
My wife & I) of them saw four objects outside of a warhead storage area at
a range of about 2500 feet and obtained movies of them. He now has about
6000 feet of movie footage, of which 5000 ft. is in Super Eight. THE
OBJECTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO 'CLOAK,' that's the word, spells CLOAK like
cloak and dagger, like cover up and he says that they can cause themselves
to GO INVISIBLE by a field that caused the light waves to bend around the
object and that one sees the sky behind them.

"He confirmed the fact that the woman was picked up when she accidentally
observed the calf being abducted. He has paid for a pathology work and
medical doctor work. The pathologist is a former head of the microbiology
department of New Mexico University. They have done CATscans to show that
the woman and her son did in fact have implants in their bodies. (* We
confirmed the woman -- not her son) She has a vaginal disease like
streptococci-bulbie(?) and tried many antibodies to destroy the bacteria.
That it has survived off the antibodies themselves. THE ALIENS KEEP
HASSLING HER. (* Still true to date).

"Paul kept the woman and her mother at his house and the UFOs were flying
overhead constantly. THERE IS NO ESP INVOLVED, BUT IT IS JUST PLAIN
PHYSICS.

"They beam down (* They send a beam down -- not 'beam down'). They can
communicate THROUGH THIS BEAM. She picked up their transmissions. He
devised a means of communication based upon her alfbic (?) code; one is
equal to 'no' and two being 'yes.' Through this code he has been able to
'talk' to the aliens. He then computerized the system that would reject
extraneous inputs. HE SAID THAT THEY CAN BE VERY THREATENING AND
MALEVOLENT...

"He then told the O.S.I. OF THE AIR FORCE and he has been requested to give
(* Did give) several presentations to high level Air Force people in
briefings on the subject, wing level Command and many others including this
fellow Edwards. And he took a heli- copter to the site (* No -- Twice to
site -- 1st by OSI agent, 2nd by a Col. Carpenter). It turned out that the
WING COMMANDER, after a presentation that this fellow made, then took a
helicopter to the site and MADE PHOTOGRAPHS.

"He says that you can see saucers on the ground. He says there is a kind of
cone -- a large cone and the larger vehicles come and land on top of the
cone with the top of the cone fitting into a hole in the bottom. There is
an elevator inside of the cone and that goes down into the mountain or
ground about one kilometer. You can see the aliens running around the base
getting into the vehicles and stuff. They use small vehicles to get around
that have no wheels. They are rectangular in shape and they levitate. They
do not show up in color BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY REFLECTIVE, but in B & W
they are visible. He says that there are beam weapons that are floating in
strategic locations and there is a road into the base. He obtained
infra-red photos of the area from an altitude of 14,000 Ft. There is a
level HIGHWAY going into the area that is 36 ft. wide. IT IS A GOVERNMENT
ROAD (i.e. apparently, part of the off-limits road that originates within
the Ute Reservation on the Colorado-New Mexico border, and leads southward
through the Jicarilla-Apache reservation toward the Archuleta plateau -
Branton). One can see telemetry trailers and buildings that are five sided
buildings with a dome. It is standard military procedure. There are many
guard points and 'stakes' and there are launch domes that one can see. Next
to the launch dome HE SAW A BLACK LIMOUSINE AND ANOTHER AT SOME DISTANCE
OFF (* Apparently). The careful measurements showed that the limousine was
the same length of his Lincoln Town car. IT IS A C.I.A. VEHICLE. ALSO THERE
WAS A BLUE VAN. He has been cautioned about these limousines as they will
run you off the road if you try to get into the area and in fact some- body
has been killed in that manner. To the north is a launch site. THERE ARE
TWO WRECKED SHIPS THERE: they are 36 feet with wings, and one can see
oxygen and hydrogen tanks. There are four cylindrical objects Socorro type
-- two carrying something while flying. The whole operation is based upon a
government agreement and a technology trade. We get out of it atomic ships
that are operated by plutonium. The Cash-Landrum case was one of them. The
doors jammed open and neutron radiation came out. They are based at
Kirtland AFB and Holloman AFB (* No -- only know of one based at HAFB) and
some place in Texas (possibly Ft. Hood, Texas -- a guess only). He said the
government is paying the hospital bills for the Cash-Landrum victims (* OSI
Input -- found out later unless someone covering -- not true). Refueling of
the plutonium is accomplished at Los Alamos. He had...pictures of this base
back to 1948 and it has been there starting in 1948. Pictures in 1962, you
can see many saucers and the base and truck... The road was 'passed off' to
the local inhabitants as a lumber contract. He has photographs (I believe)
of the firing of a beam weapon that (?) in two directions. (That would be
necessary on a flying saucer. The reaction forces would impede the
vehicle.) He has computed the speeds of (the) flying saucers at 15,000 mph
and indicates that THE PILOTS (* of ours) ARE FROM N.S.A., THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY. The aliens (i.e. one particular group? - Branton) have had
atomic propulsion system for 48 years and the saucers themselves operate on
an electric charge basis having to do with crystal semiconductor and (*
Maybe) a super lattice. I think he said 'as you increase the voltage, the
current goes down.'... At present there are six to eight vehicles, maybe up
to ten over the area and sometimes up to 100. THEY CAN BE SEEN IN THE
CLOUDS. They go into cumulus clouds and produce nitrogen nitride. (* I
assume or speculate it is this) YOU WILL SEE BLACK SPOTS IN THE CLOUD. They
eat holes in the cloud. If you can see black spots in a cloud, then you can
tell that a vehicle is in there.

"He says that they come from six different cultures and in his
communications (he learned that) some come from a binary system, possibly
Zeta Reticuli and from distances up to and larger than 32 light years away.
They also (* appear to) have one to three ships in (geosynchronous? -
Branton) earth orbit at 50,000 KM altitude (* Based upon data). He had to
form the words to try to communicate and he produced a vocabulary of 627
words in a matrix form and used a computer. The Flying Saucers (* we see)
are limited to operation in the atmosphere.

"Now with regard to the cattle problem, the ALIENS are using the DNA FROM
CATTLE AND ARE MAKING HUMANOIDS. He got pictures of their video screen.
SOME OF THE CREATURES ARE ANIMAL LIKE, some are near human and some are
human and short with large heads (the so-called hybrids? One abductee
reported viewing an 'apparent' genetic experiment involving possible
human-cattle hybridization. She viewed another woman abductee who was put
asleep on a table, something -- possibly ova -- being removed from her
abdomen by a Gray, at which point the Gray went over and worked on a cow
that was laying unconscious on another table. Could SOME of the 'hybrids'
be the result of genetic cross-breeding between humans and cattle rather
than humans and reptilians? - Branton). They grow the embryos. After (that)
the embryos become active by a year of training pre- sumably that is
required for them to become operational. When they die, they go back into
the tank. Their parts are recovered.

"In 1979 something happened and the base was closed. There was an argument
over weapons (Robert Lazar states that the Nevada DREAMLAND conflict
between human and alien security was sparked by an argument over weapons.
Since the DREAM- LAND and DULCE base are reportedly connected via tube
shuttles then this "argument" may have spread to the Dulce Base, although
Thomas Castello states that one of the major reasons for the DULCE WARS was
the discovery of humans who had been permanently abducted or mutilated in a
blatant violation of the joint- interaction treaties - Branton) and our
people were chased out, more than 100 people involved. (Someplace later he
indicates further details on this point.)

"The base is 4000 ft. long and our helicopters are going in there all the
time. When it became known that he was familiar with all this, the
mutilations stopped. (* True) They are taking humanoid embryos out of this
base to somewhere else. I asked if it was Albuquerque or Los Alamos, but he
said he didn't know. (Note: 1/8/86 -- looks like it is Albuquerque)
[subterranean bases below Albuquerque? - Branton] He said there are still
quite a few helicopters in operation. They fly at night. (* all unmarked)
HE WENT UP THERE HIMSELF IN A HELICOPTER AND THE O.S.I. BRIEFED THE COPTER
PILOT AND HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE COPTER PILOT HIMSELF WAS AN UNDERCOVER
MAN. They saw helicopter pads up there -- Viet Nam type, with bearing
markers and trees pushed off away from the location. It is such a wild area
he said. He agreed to send me the coordinates of this base.

"Regarding abductions of people, they pick out medium to low IQ personnel.
They are able to scope out each one (so we can do the same thing with
electro-magnetic spectrum analyzers). (* I don't know this part -- word
mixup -- drop). They pick up these people and then put implants into them
and then take tissue samples, including ovum from the women, sperm from the
men and DNA.

"THEY CAN PROGRAM THESE PEOPLE AS SLAVES TO DO WHATEVER THEY WISH AND THEY
WILL HAVE NO MEMORY OF IT. THEY (The Hard Core type) STAUNCHLY REFUSE TO BE
X-RAYED OR HYPNOTICALLY REGRESSED. YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR
EYES. HE SAYS 'PECULIAR LOOK IN THE EYES AND A FUNNY SMILE.' (* An
expression) Hynek knows about all of this and has been in contact with
Coral (Lorenzen). He regards Hynek as a threat. (* Not really -- I just
think he is still a Gov. cover) At his house, he showed Hynek films and out
in the back yard a flying saucer. He asked Hynek about his view with regard
to abductions as to how many people might have been abducted. Hynek,
unhesitatingly said ABOUT ONE OUT OF FORTY.

"He said that many people come to his door to see him, just 'out of the
blue' and HE SEES SCARS ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECKS (Note: Refer to the
remake of the movie INVADERS FROM MARS and also the movie THE PUPPETMASTERS
based on Robert A. Heinleins book. The former depicted a mind-control
implant inserted into the lower brain through the BACK OF THE NECK --
leaving scars, whereas the latter depicted an alien parasite that attached
itself in a controlling capacity to a human brain through the BACK OF THE
NECK. - Branton). That previous old scars are easy to detect and that new
ones are hard to detect. HE FEELS THAT THIS IS A SICKENING SITUATION.

"THE ALIENS HAVE GONE WILD AND USE HYPODERMICS (and notes a 'parallel four
times.') (McCampbell: I don't know what that means) (* I don't know
either). He has been paralyzed four times and has been hit 250 times by
hypodermics. He says they knock you cold and they do whatever they want to
do and the above points have been verified medically.

"A man came to see him with a top secret document that was dated in the
50's, indicating if anybody found out about all of this they would kill
them. He was asked 'doesn't that bother you?' He said 'no it didn't.'

"He said he had sent in some film to Kodak and there were seven rolls. They
were Ectrochrome G which could not be processed locally, so they had to go
to Kodak. He does all of the film work commercially so that nobody could
claim that he had 'monkeyed' with the film. His films came back, but one of
them -- one was plain Ectrochrome, but (* Was missing for 2 months -- when
received) nine feet was missing and this was close-ups of UFOs that he had
taken. THE MISSING PICTURES OF THE NINE FEET SHOWED UP (* The 9 ft. didn't
-- others known only to me did) IN A TOP SECRET DOCUMENT THAT HE STUDIED
AND THE CODE NAME IS AQUARIUS AND IT IS A PROJECT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY (* I was told NASA). They are the ones that kept his film and copied
it with deletions on Ectrochrome and sent it back (* I suspect).

"THERE HAVE BEEN INDIRECT THREATS BY THE AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE AGAINST
HIM.

"THE LOCATION OF THE BASE IS 2 1/2 MILES NORTH- WEST OF DULCE AND ALMOST
OVERLOOKS THE TOWN. IT IS UP ON THE MESA. We discussed the similarity
between everything we have been talking about here and the movie 'CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND'. He said he speculated THAT seemed to be a
plan of disclosure, that is the movie. The coordinates of the location are
not far off and the mountain where the actual base is looks much like the
mountain in the movie.

"The next thing was -- Discussing the trade off -- alright. Here is what we
got in the trade off. We got atomic technology, the atomic flying ships.
Several of them, the first one wrecked on the ground and it can be seen and
photographed from the air. A second one wrecked. A third one was wrecked.
Apparently this last one was repaired and was the one that was in Houston
-- near Houston in the Cash-Landrum case. The second item was that we get
out of it, are the beam weapons, the beam technology and third (* I
speculate) is the thought beam. That is the means by which communication is
accomplished. It is electrostatic in character with a magnetic component (*
artifact) and it is the only way of communicating with people. They have to
have the implants in order to use it. The crash that occurred at the base
WHEN THERE WAS A DISTURBANCE OF SOME SORT, THE ALIENS KILLED 66 OF OUR
PEOPLE AND 44 GOT AWAY. (* Alien computer input -- True? I do not know.)
(Note: Did the grays destroy that craft? Even if Bennewitz was able to LINK
INTO and INTERROGATE the alien computer mainframe and discover certain
secrets, there is the possibility that the aliens 'may' have used this in
reverse and fed him with false information, as is their nature. As for the
'altercation' at the base, other human sources such as Thomas Castello have
CONFIRMED this - Branton). Over an argument -- they turned on us.

"...He was familiar with what the aliens called MPS which means
manipulations per second -- no, manipulations per sequence. (An)
electrostatic field that can be manipulated into many configurations and
the craft can stall. In order to prevent this, the field is adjusted once
every forty milliseconds. He studied the trails from UFOs and they seem to
break down into a pulse rate of 62 per second. Based upon the color movie
pictures, there seems to be a blast of light and spectral components and
composi- tion in there, with a Bow-Wave in front of the UFO with nitrogen
showing green and oxygen showing blue, but with the saucer being invisible.
They can run into a car or airplane and this Bow-Wave will destroy them.
Rockets can hit this Bow-Wave and be destroyed. They can't penetrate it. At
White Sands he was shown pictures of an F-15 shooting rockets with a
missile at a target and the saucers came in behind the missile, 30 ft.
behind, and then flew through the explosion. He didn't know what the
purpose of the demonstration was, but suspected it might be just to show
how invulnerable they are. But sometimes the saucers get into trouble and
they are all consumed in some kind of way.

"When he went up to Dulce in a helicopter, they landed and left some
equipment there, but then when they came back the pilot was extremely
nervous. Paul wanted to land on the base, but the pilot wouldn't do that.
They came back to Dulce and landed at a small strip there, where they found
two large Huey helicopters. The Indian (* Highway Patrolman) in charge
there named Valdez went aboard one of the choppers AND THEY FOUND THEM TO
BE FULL OF COMMANDOS. THEY ESTIMATED A TOTAL OF 75 COMMANDOS, fully armed
with M-1 rifles (* No -- M16's) and rockets (* & launchers). They did not
have any indication of rank (* Valdez says no -- not true -- my mistake --
I did not get that all) ["not true" meaning that they DID have indication
of rank? - Branton]. They only had shoulder patches on and the helicopters
had no identification other than numbers. The helicopters were part of a
project called BLUE LIGHT (Note: John Lear says that during his
investigations into the BLUE LIGHT Project, he learned of a former Dulce
worker who was being held captive in a peripheral base in the Dulce network
-- below Sleeping Ute Mt., which Lear implies was located in SE Utah. Lear
did NOT find the Blue Light base, however - Branton) and they were from Ft.
Carson, Colorado (* OSI Input). When they left they were escorted by these
two large Huey helicopters. As they were flying along -- in the back-
ground, they saw rise up one of the advanced space technology vehicles that
looked like a manta ray with a negative dihedral and projections coming
down. It flew vertically past two accompanying helicopters. PAUL FEELS THAT
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS INFORMATION BE RELEASED BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT IT
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN SUCH AN
ARRANGEMENT THAT INVADES THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS BY THE
IMPLANTATION'S. HE SAID THAT 'ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH BY THE
ALIENS, THEY ARE NEVER THE SAME.' (I suppose one can easily believe that.
-- Jim McCampbell comments) So it appears that, for the privilege of
collecting the biological materials in the mutilation of (cattle) and the
abductions and the operations on board the craft, the government has
allowed this to go on and even to assist for the privilege of getting the
nuclear flight technology, plus also the embryos which are flown out of the
base. (A rather fantastic story -- Jim McCampbell comment) Paul strikes me
as being an extremely conservative, extremely knowledgeable and reliable
scientist, who was intimately familiar with sophisticated laboratory
equipment. His is thoroughly scientific and reliable. (Jim McCampbell
evaluation)

"...I inquired about the other bases that were referred to in the
'STIGMATA' report or article. He said all that he knew (was) that one was
to the south, one to the west and one to the east and he doesn't want to
know anything more about it.

"I discussed the prospect of using the paper in the MUFON Proceedings to
try to find the center of gravity for the mutilation cases from those maps
that run from about 1972 to 1982 or 1983. The word gravity triggered in his
mind another connection having to do with the Dept. of Interior that has a
gravity dept. and they do in fact survey the United States and publish maps
indicating the gravity contours. THERE IS A VERY WEAK GRAVITY at the site
near Dulce. He said that the craft are very sensitive to the gravity levels
and that SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS THE OTHER SITES MIGHT ALSO BE LOCATED
RELATIVE TO WEAK GRAVITY (Note: a lower gravity field, which is detectable
by sen- sitive equipment although not necessarily discernible to humans,
also reportedly indicates a lower earth-mass below ground, or rather a
greater possibility for porous or cavernous subterranean levels below
'weak' gravity field areas. A careful study of weak gravity field contours
may help immensely in tracking down sub- terraneous systems, anything from
untapped oil deposits to unoccupied cavern systems to underground bases
occupied by either benevolent or malevolent 'alien' cultures - Branton).
