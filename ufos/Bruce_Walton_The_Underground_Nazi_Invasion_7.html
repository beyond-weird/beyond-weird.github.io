 [PART 7]

Researcher William Cooper released the following letter FROM a Martin
Cannon of Canoga Park, California. The individual's name TO WHOM the letter
was addressed is not given:

"Dear (Name Deleted); "Thanks for your recent letter. "I think that we
could indeed be helpful to each other. My project is now taking me into
some very odd areas indeed, and I need all the guidance possible. But more
on that later. "First... UFO [magazine], vol. 2, #4 includes an article by
Barry Taff, written in conjunction with one Kerry Gaynor, entitled
'Paranormal Phenomena and UFOs.' The article itself was not nearly so
interesting as Taff's resume" '...he has worked with UCLA's
Neuropsychiatric Institute and has acted as a consultant to a number of
government agencies, including the National Energy Commission and the CIA.'
(Gaynor is described as a 'Hypnotherapist and UCLA graduate' who has worked
with Taff from 1974 to 1980.) "Ohh, gee, (NAME DELETED)... you actually
TRUST this guy? "Perhaps the most ominous connection in that resume is not
to the CIA, but to the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, Dr. Louis Joylon
West's spook-house. You must know [of] West's covert background -- his work
in brainwashing for the CIA, his horrifying institute For the Study of
Violent Behavior, his connection to the V.A. hospital...and that's just the
beginning. Info on 'Jolly' is tough to come by, but I've got some stuff you
won't believe -- especially some very bizarre tidbits ostensibly connecting
him to John Lilly. West is a spook and a fascist, and he has been involved
in ALL the techniques of mind control. "I interviewed someone who met West
socially; he described the good doctor -- AND his wife! -- as frightening,
peculiar, and very, very strange...almost the stereotypical 'mad
scientist.' The same descrip- tions keep on popping up whenever I get
'personal' on the spy-chiatrists. You think these guys practice their mind
altering techniques on each other? "Rand, AEC, NIMM -- you KNOW their
histories. Taff is linked to warmongers, covert operations, and
brainwashers. The man is BAD NEWS, and any exculpatory fables he tells you
should be disregarded. If you want my advice, stay away from this guy, even
if he claims to offer an inside track on the scoop of the century, and even
if his info tends to verify your preconceptions. Please don't take this as
an insult, but frankly, the fact that you deal with Taff (and Lear) makes
me uneasy dealing with you. "On the other hand... As you know, my main
business right now is catching the brainwashers. Taff and Gaynor seem to be
possible targets -- their backgrounds make them suspicious to me. Maybe you
can help my project by 'picking their brains' on the subject of mind
control. Ask Taff about the use of microwaves to create audi- tory
phenomena, he mentions this effect (the 'Frey effect') in his article, and
connects it to UFOs. I'd like more information on this topic, but medical
references are hard to come by. For God's sake, though -- don't tell Taff
what I'm up to! "Additionally, I'd like to get hold of a photograph of
Gaynor. One excellent method of playing 'spot the spook' might be the trick
demon- strated in the film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE -- flashing a series of
photographs past the eyes of an alleged brainwashing victim, in the hope
that images of certain 'doctors' will strike a cord. It's an idea -- if you
have any others, please let me know. "About Vicki [editor of 'UFO' magazine
who actually admitted that the magazine was financed by the CIA. - Wol.] --
well, thereby hangs a tale, one which has caused me no small amount of
personal hurt and sorrow and bewilderment. I've inflicted my anger on
everyone I know -- and you'll be no exception, alas; I apologize beforehand
for the torrent of spew to come... "Her uncle is Grant Cooper, the attorney
for Sirhan Sirhan -- and for the Johnny Roselli mob, which was intricately
connected to the CIA. I am sending you photocopies of the relevant pages
from Donald Scheim's book, 'CONTRACT ON AMERICA.' Theodore Charach's film,
'THE SECOND GUN' (released on MCI home video as 'THE PLOT TO KILL ROBERT F.
KENNEDY') contains interviews in which Sirhan's mother curses out her son's
attorneys. As you know, they willfully disregarded testimony which could
have helped Sirhan's case. Morrow's 'THE SENATOR MUST DIE' also has useful
information. Grant Cooper is as corrupt as they come, in my opinion: While
defending Roselli's men, he literally got hold of the prosecution's list of
potential witnesses. (Gee -- now why would the mob want a thing like
THAT?). Actually, it's a bit of a hassle to get the xeroxes made right now
-- But this summary should do. "As you can guess, the fact that Vicki
[Cooper] has an uncle like this -- and a friend like Barry Taff -- made me
nervous. My (UNREADABLE/FADED) was not quelled by Vicki's frequent (UN-
READABLE) about the CIA somehow 'pushing' her magazine. "Still, I felt I
could trust her because she seemed so gung-ho when it came to exposing
intelligence agency abuses. She was attending ARDIS lectures, familiarizing
herself with the Christie case, reading Prouty, talking to Landis and
Stockwell and John Judge -- all very impressive. "But then she changed.
Whereas we exchanged information almost daily, suddenly she grew more
distant -- and when we did talk, an odd anti-soviet hysteria entered her
dialogue. For example, she suggested (employing a truly unique quasi-logic)
that the key to my UFO hypothesis might have to do with the 'massive'
Soviet infiltration of the media; apparently, the abductions are some sort
of dirty red propaganda ploy. "Her tone baffled me -- until I met her new
boyfriend, one Don Ecker, ex-Green Beret and foreign-policy 'fascist'
(Vicki's description -- although later she rather annoyingly pinned the
words on me)... "Now I feel betrayed. Vicki and I had, after all, worked
quite closely together -- and we were going after the spooks. For that sort
of project, you need partners of like mind when it comes to matters
political. Then she hops into bed with (for all intents and purposes) the
CIA itself! (You know about Special Forces connect- ions with the Company,
the Nazis, Laotian drug smuggling, Jones- town, etc.) Suddenly, Vicki
changed from... ARDIS attendee to an interested guest at the official
ex-spook organization. Suddenly, she calls me a fanatic. (She also calls
her boyfriend a fascist -- apparently, fascism isn't fanaticism.) "Because
she presented such an unprecedented case of elasticity, I wondered if SHE
was a spook. To tell the truth, for a week or three, I was certain of
it..."

The following are excepts from an article, titled "THE ASSASSINS" [KPFA.,
Berkeley, California -- June 2, 1984], released by John Judge., P.O. Box
6586., T St. Station NW., Washington, DC 20009:

Remarks by independent researcher John Judge.

...[We] Must understand that the US intelligence network, and its worldwide
network of intelligence operations and connected foreign agencies kill
people. They carry out both specific hits on political targets broad and
domestically as well. They also have as their goal the control of human
minds. What Orwell called "the space between our ears". For thirty years
they have experimented on methods of mind control, under the code name
MKULTRA, and other programs. Again both individual and mass control...

They are an extension of an international FASCIST network. NAZI SS men
escaped punishment after the war with the help of 'US' intelligence [the
Rockefellers and members of secret, Bavarian-based, lodges. - Wol.]. SPIES,
SCIENTISTS and MILITARY MEN went around the world under the cover of the
ODESSA, DIE SPINNE, and KAMARADENWORK groups [that were] SET UP TO SAVE
NAZI WAR CRIMINALS. 300 NAZI SPIES UNDER GEN. REINHARD GEHLEN FORMED OUR
CIA AND GERMAN BND. Hundreds of aerospace, and munitions experts formed our
MILI- TARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. To fund themselves and to maintain control
abroad, they also recruited and used trained assassins, mercen- aries,
provocateurs, and torturers. These people carried out hits, assas-
sinations, paramilitary operations and terrorism, and continue to the
present day. They are financed by the international traffick in drugs (esp.
opium and cocaine), arms sales and taxes by the governments and military
structures they control...

Recruitment, cover and movement is handled by a combination of dummy front
corporations, foreign governments, evangelical operations, and co-
operative government officials here at home.

Examples of specific hits: Patrice Lamumba of the Congo, Salvador Allende
in Chile (Green Berets), the Guevara (same), Malcolm X, the Kennedy
brothers, Martin Luther King, and more recent deaths like Congressman Leo
Ryan, John Lennon, Ronald Reagan... and Jessica Savitch and David Kennedy

Examples of mass murders: Phoenix program in Vietnam, Chemical Biological
Warfare experiments on large populations (Cuba), Jonestown murders, and the
continued killing of psychiatric patients (300,000 in Nazi Germany)...

[Assassination] training involved three steps: weapons training, dis-
affection from the emotional response to violence, and dehumanization of
the enemy target in the killer's mind. The disaffection was accom- plished
by locking their head and eyes in clamps, forcing them [merc- enary agents]
to watch films of violence, and asking questions unrelated to the violent
acts. Similar to CLOCKWORK ORANGE methods shown in the popular film. Once
no emotional response registered to violence, they're ready to be
programmed with RACIST and dehumanizing myths and lies about the target
populations involved.

The following excerpts were taken from the Kathy Herman show (K-TKK or
'K-TALK' Radio, Salt Lake City, Utah; AM-63, 10:00- 12:00 P.M. Sunday
night, July 4, 1993). Her guest that evening was Anthony J. Hilder. Hilder
made reference to the following:

-- Brown Brothers Harriman, I.G. Farben, and General Electric helped to
finance Adolph Hitler during World War II. George Bush has stated that
everything he was 'today' he owed to the Rockefellers (who owned the oil
companies that supplied oil to Nazi Germany).

-- 'OPERATION PAPERCLIP' was an operation to bring Nazi scientists from
Germany to America. OSS, Interpol, CIA and the Nazis were all working
together under the Bavarian Illuminati.

-- A Mr. Otto Skorzeny helped to establish a working link between the CIA
and the Nazi S.S. in certain projects, according to one individual who
called in.

-- Hilder's videos and tapes could (at the time of this broadcast) be
obtained from the following address: P.O. Box 1122., Malabu, CA 90265.

-- In Aug. 23, 1939 Adolph Hitler made a secret pact with the Communists.

-- The Dulce facility in New Mexico was mentioned, along with the possible
CIA 'Nazi Scientist' connection to the facility. Hilder quoted from Bill
Hamilton's book 'COSMIC TOP SECRET', in- cluding references made by Thomas
Castello concerning hundreds, possibly thousands of humans who were/are
being held in cages on level 7 of the underground facility [concentration
camp], people who were being used as experimental subjects for genetic
experi- mentation, etc., people with whom the late Dulce Security Officer
and later defector Thomas Castello and other upper-level base workers were
forbidden to communicate... [Note: There have also been reports of
'government' officials seen in this base with badges carrying the
triangular symbol of the Bavarian Illuminati. - Wol.]

In his lengthy file, "SECRET SOCIETIES AND THE NEW WORLD ORDER", later
published as a chapter in his book "BEHOLD A PALE HORSE", former Navy
Intelligence worker William Cooper states:

"...In the early 1940s, the I.G. Farben Chemical Company employed a Polish
salesman who sold cyanide to the Nazis for use in Auschwitz. The same
salesman also worked as a chemist in the manufacture of the poison gas.
This same cyanide gas along with Zyklon B and malathion was used to
exterminate millions of Jews and other groups. "Their bodies were then
burned to ashes in the ovens. After the war the salesman, fearing for his
life, joined the Catholic Church and was ordained a priest in 1946. One of
his closest friends was Dr. Wolf Szmuness, the mastermind behind the
November/78 to October/79 and March/80 to October/81 experi- mental
hepatitis B vaccine trials conducted by the Center for Dis- ease Control in
New York, San Francisco and four other American cities that loosed the
plague of AIDS upon the American people. The salesman was ordained Poland's
youngest bishop in 1958. After a 30-day reign his predecessor was
assassinated and our ex-cyanide gas salesman assumed the papacy as Pope
John Paul II. "1990 is the right time with the right leaders: ex-chief of
the Soviet secret police Mikhail Gorbachev, ex-chief of the CIA George
Bush, ex-Nazi cyanide gas salesman Pope John Paul II, all bound by an
unholy alliance to bring in the New World Order..."

[Note: There is little argument that Constantine, the last 'Emperor' of the
Roman Empire became the first 'Pontiff' of the so-called 'Holy Roman
Empire' (HO.R.E.). Many claim that the Roman Empire never actually 'fell',
but instead learned that religious and economic 'conquest' and manipulation
were far more effective tools of Imperialism than mere political-military
might. Don't accuse me of blasting a 'religion' when in fact I'm talking
about a POLITICAL FORCE. Now IF the Catholic church were to establish its
center of power elsewhere so as not to be alligned with ROME and the pagan
empire it once ruled, then that would be a different story. But isn't that
exactly what the Greek Orthodox church was? The G.O. church split off from
the Roman Church in ancient times, not willing to be part of the
pagan-political forces which NEVER LEFT ROME following the supposed "fall"
of the Roman Empire. The new Roman Empire (HO.R.E.) traditionally spanned
Germany, Austria and Italy which later formed the 'Triple Alliance' through
the first and second World Wars. The Roman 'church' carried out the
horrendous Inquisitions of the Middle Ages wherein hundreds of thousands of
Protestants were mercilessly slaughtered. The Hun tribes of the once
Roman-controlled Germany served as the hub of the ancient Roman Empire's
military machine. Historically there has been in-fighting between Rome and
Bavaria as to who would control the 'empire', but in essence they are two
sides of the same coin. The ancient Babylonian serpent cult of the
'Illuminati' was brought from Egypt by the Germanic-Romanist armies and
Bavaria became the new headquarters of the cult. The main Babylonian
obelisk-idol of Ashtaroth-Baal which once stood in the center of Egyptian
pagan sun-worship in Hieropolis, Egypt was literally brought to St. Peter's
Square in Rome at great cost and effort by the Vatican. Why would a
'Christian' church be so fascinated by an OBVIOUSLY PAGAN IDOL? Could it be
that they are not as Judeo-Christian as they claim to be? Later Germany was
notorious for the 'Nazi' terror. Another indication that the
Germany-Austria-Italy "HO.R.E." empire is still in effect is that the Roman
Jezuits made or make up a large portion of Adolph Hitler's Nazi S.S.
organization; also, during World War II Adolph Hitler's homeland of Austria
was 100% NAZI and 95% ROMAN Catholic. Apparently there was NO conflict
between the two. The Jesuits I'm sure were pleased to see the continuation
of their ancient INQUISITION against the Jews and the Protestant nations of
the world via the Nazi war machine. Today these three countries (or one
country in three from another perspective) make up the core of the EUROPEAN
UNION which is just another name for the European "NEW WORLD ORDER". -
