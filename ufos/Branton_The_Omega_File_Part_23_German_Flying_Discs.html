                            GERMAN FLYING DISCS

Hitler's advanced technology included intercontinental ballistic missiles,
vertical takeoff aircraft, jet engines, cruise missiles, sound cannons, and
many other advanced items. The Allies captured plans for what became the
Boeing 747 Jumbo jet. Among the most secret items captured were plans for
flying disks, that were at first called "Krautmeteors." Based on the
evidence, they were built as early as around 1933 and went into mass
production in 1940. Scientists involved in these projects were Bellonzo,
Schriever, Miethe and Victor Schauberger.

Schauberger developed the "flying hat" type disc that was later seen over
the United States. The final version was the Bellonzo-Schriever-Miethe
Diskus, as large as 135 feet and some up to 225 feet in diameter. They
traveled over 2,000 km/hr and were planned to go over 4,000 km/hr. In 1945
they could reach a speed of 1,300 mph and an altitude of 40,000 feet in
less than three minutes. The Germans developed the Delta wing craft, and
were working on stealth technology, etc.
Many pilots saw the strange craft over Germany. However, as soon as a craft
was built, Hitler ordered it disassembled and shipped somewhere -- probably
Antarctica. None of the craft were captured by the Allies, although some of
the scientists were captured and then mostly disappeared, but can somewhat
be traced to Bell Textron and to places such as Area 51, which, surprise!,
is infamous for its 'UFO' sightings.

Here are some examples of news items during WW II concerning Germany's
UFOs, from the "New York Times:"

"NEW YORK TIMES," December 14, 1944: "Floating Mystery Ball Is New German
Weapon. SUPREME HEADQUARTERS, Allied Expeditionary Force, Dec. 13 -- A new
German weapon has made its appearance on the western air front, it was
disclosed today. "Airmen of the American Air Force report that they are
encountering silver colored spheres in the air over German territory. The
spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters. Sometimes they are
semi-translucent."
...and, "SUPREME HEADQUARTERS Dec. 13 [Reuters] -- The Germans have
produced a 'secret' weapon in keeping with the Christmas season.

"The new device, apparently an air defense weapon, resembles the huge glass
balls that adorn Christmas trees. There was no information available as to
what holds them up like stars in the sky, what is in them or what their
purpose is supposed to be."

(Note: In regards to the above, Bulgarian Physicist Vladimir Terziski wrote
the following about the Nazi mystery 'spheres' and aerial disc projects:
"...According to Renato Vesco... Germany was sharing a great deal of the
advances in weaponry with their allies the ITALIANS during the war. At the
Fiat experimental facility at lake La Garda, a facility that fittingly bore
the name of air martial Hermann Goering, the Italians were experimenting
with numerous advanced weapons, rockets and airplanes, created in Germany.
In a similar fashion, the Germans kept a close contact with the Japanese
military establishment and were supplying it with many advanced weapons. I
have discovered for example a photo of a copy of the manned version of the
V-1 -- the Reichenberg -- produced in Japan by Mitsubishi. The best fighter
in the world, the push-pull twin propeller Domier-335 was duplicated at the
Kawashima works. Or a photo of Japanese high ranking Imperial navy officers
inspecting the latest German radar station. A Japanese friend of mine in
Los Angeles related to me the story of his friend's father, who worked as
technician in an aircraft research bureau in Japan during the war. In July
of 1945, two and a half months after the war ended in Germany, a huge
German transport submarine brought to Japan the latest of German inventions
-- two spherical wingless flying devices. The Japanese R&D team put the
machines together, following the German instructions, and... there was
something very bizarre and other-earthy standing in front of them -- a ball
shaped flying device without wings or propellers, that nobody knew how it
flied. The fuel was added, the start button of this unmanned machine was
pressed and it .... disappeared with a roar and flames without [into] the
sky. The team never saw it again. The engineers were so frightened by the
unexpected might of the machine, that they promptly dynamited the second
prototype and choose to forget the whole incident." - Branton)
