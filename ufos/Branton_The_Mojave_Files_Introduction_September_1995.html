Dear Mr. Shapiro

While broswing through the https:// Page "AREA 51 RESEARCH CENTER" recently (you
may want to check it out if you have not already done so), I came across
your UFO Theories and Cover-Up page, and noticed some of the early writings
form the writer/researcher "Branton" therein.

In that I am a personal aquaintance of "Branton", I thought that you might
be interested in the NEW files that he has released (enclosed find one disk
and a backup). Some of these files you may have already seen, but others I
am certain will be new to you.

Branton states that he is a "sleeper" agent for the CIA who was (possibly
after stumbling on some information that he wasn't supposed to know)
electronically induced with an alternative personality which was
"programmed" to serve the CIA Black Projects and the Bavarian-Gray
collective. In this alternate or "double life" he had access to several
underground bases, and has apparently encountered several alien groups as
well.

When his "conscious" self began to awaken to the facts of this alternate
existance (facts that were confirmed by others whom he knew), he began to
investigate deeper and to expose the conspiracy against this planet in the
best way that he knew how. He is not yet certain whether or ot his
"alternate self" presently shares his conscious values.

I have since learned that a great many people are involved in such "double"
lives and have been programmed with alternate nocturnal personalities which
"kick in" once they are in the presence of the aliens ... these inclue
contactees who work with human "Federation" personnel, others who work with
the "Ashtar" collective, and still others who are beingused by the "Gray"
Empire in their continued efforts to infiltrate our society. Several of the
"Montauk" crowd such as Preston Nichols, Al Bielek and Duncan Cameron also
claim that they had been programmed with alternate personalities during
their work with the space-time and mind-control projects being carried out
at Montauk Point, Long Island in the mid 1980's.

Branton himself has a strong feeling that he was also involved with this
project in some fashion. In 1985 when the Montauk Project was sabotaged and
had ceased for a time, he was 25 years of age. This project is once again
in full swing at Montauk, but everything has now been taken underground
down into the 8-leveled subterranean facility there, which is being
operatted jointly by the CIA, the (Nazi) Thule Scoeity, and the alien Grays
and is to be a key operational base for the implementation of their "New
World Order". This base has some connection with another base under the
Archuleta mesa near Dulce, New Mexico where the Grays themselves have their
underground headquarters.

I hope that you find the encolsed information interesting. Unfortunately,
due to my present position, I cannot reveal my onw name at this time.

I wish you the best of success in your continual search for the TRUTH ...
