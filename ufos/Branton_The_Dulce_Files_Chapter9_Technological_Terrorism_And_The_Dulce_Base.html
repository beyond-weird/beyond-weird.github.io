TECHNOLOGICAL TERRORISM & THE DULCE BASE





The elusive "Commander-X" has -- through his reported connections within
the Intelligence Community -- released still further revelations regarding
the dark secrets of Dulce. The Commander claims to be a member of "THE
COMMITTEE OF 12" [COM-12?], an obscure intelligence group which is working
to educate the public about the joint fascist-alien threat to America and
preserve our Constitutional-based Republic as it was established by the
original founders of the United States:



"...There were over 650 attendees to the 1959 Rand Symposium. Most were
representatives of the Corporate-Industrial State, like: The General
Electric Company; AT&T; Hughes Aircraft; Northrop Corporation; Sandia
Corporation; Colorado School of Mines, etc.

"Bechtel (pronounced BECK-tul, a San Francisco - based organization -
Branton) is a supersecret international corporate octopus, founded in 1898.
Some say the firm is really a 'Shadow Government' -- a working arm of the
CIA. It is the largest Construction and Engineering outfit in the U.S.A.
and the World [and some say, beyond].

"The most important posts in the U.S.A. Government are held by former
Bechtel Officers. They are part of 'The Web' [an inter-connected control
system] which links the Tri-lateralist plans, the C.F.R., the Order of
'Illuminism' [Cult of the All-seeing Eye] and other interlocking groups..."

"MIND MANIPULATING EXPERIMENTS... The Dulce Base has studied mind control
implants; Bio-Psi Units; ELF Devices capable of Mood, Sleep and Heartbeat
control, etc.

"D.A.R.P.A. [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] is using these
technologies to manipulate people. They established 'The Projects,' set
priorities, coordinate efforts and guide the many participants in these
undertakings. Related Projects are studied at Sandia Base by 'The Jason
Group' [of 55 Scientists]. They have secretly harnessed the Dark Side of
Technology and hidden the beneficial technology from the public.

"Other Projects take place at 'Area 51' in Nevada... 'Dream-land' [Data
Repository Establishment and Maintenance Land]; Elmint [Electromagnetic
Intelligence]; Cold Empire; Code EVA; Program HIS [Hybrid Intelligence
System]: BW/CW; IRIS [Infrared Intruder Systems]; BI-PASS; REP-TILES, etc.

"The studies on Level Four at Dulce include Human Aura research, as well as
all aspects of Dream, Hypnosis, Telepathy, etc. [research]. They know how
to manipulate the Bioplasmic Body. They can lower your heartbeat with Deep
Sleeve 'Delta Waves,' induce a static shock, then reprogram, Via a
Brain-Computer link. They can introduce data and programmed reactions into
your Mind [Information impregnation -- the 'Dream Library'].

"We are entering an era of Technologicalization of Psychic Powers... The
development of techniques to enhance man/machine communications; Nano-tech;
Bio-tech micro-machines; PSI-War; E.D.O.M. [Electronic Dissolution of
Memory]; R.H.I.C. [Radio-Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control]; and various
forms of behavior control [via chemical agents, ultrasonics, optical and
other EM radiations]. The Physics of 'Consciousness.'...

"SURVIVING THE FUTURE... The Dulce Facility consists of a central 'Hub.'
the Security Section [also some photo labs]. The deeper you go, the
stronger the Security. This is a multi-leveled complex. There are over 3000
cameras at various high-security locations [exits and labs].

"There are over 100 Secret Exits near and around Dulce, many around
Archuleta Mesa, others to the source around Dulce Lake and even as far east
as Lindrich.

"Deep sections of the Complex CONNECT INTO [EXTENSIVE] NATURAL CAVERN
SYSTEMS.

"...INSIDE THE DULCE BASE... Security officers wear jumpsuits, with the
Dulce symbol on the front, upper left side (the Dulce symbol consists of an
upside-down triangle with an inverted 'T' superimposed over it -
Branton)... The ID card [used in card slots, for the doors and elevators]
has the Dulce symbol above the ID photo. 'Government honchos' use cards
with the Great Seal of the U.S. on it. 'The Cult of the All-Seeing Eye'
[The NEW WORLD ORDER], 13, '666', The Phoenix Empire... '9',
'Illuminism'... 'One out of many.' [and so on]..."

"THE PHANTOM BOARD: ABOVE THE LAW... Most meetings of 'The Dulce Board' are
held in Denver and Taos [New Mexico]. A former U.S. Senator has full
knowledge of Dulce. He was among the group that included a number of very
prominent government figures who toured the base (i.e. most likely the
upper levels only - Branton). In 1979, an 'animal mutilation' conference
took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This meeting was used to locate
researchers and determine what they had learned about the link between the
'mute' [i.e. mutilation] operations and the 'Alien' government.

"Another Senator knows about the 'Ultra' secrets at 'Dreamland' and Dulce.
Several of my official sources have confirmed this to me. So do many others
in government... this is what the UFO researchers are up against...so be
careful. You know more than they want you to know.

"They have also underwater bases off the coast of Florida and Peru.

"More detailed information will be released in the near future: photos,
video tapes, documents, etc. Watch out for 'Special Agents' among you now.

"In the 1930's, DIVISION FIVE of the FBI knew about the 'Aliens.'

"A FASCIST cabal within this country had John Kennedy assassinated. Look to
the links within the larger Umbrella... the 'WEB' of a fascist totalitarian
secret police state... within the Pentagon; JCS, DIA, FBI [Division Five];
DISC/DIS and the DIA. Note: The Defense Investigative Services insignia is
a composite of the Sun's rays, a rose and a dagger, symbolizing 'The Search
for Information, Trustworthiness and Danger.'

"This links with caves used for 'Initiation Rites' all over the world...
ancient vaults, retreats, [underground 'bases']..." etc.

Commander 'X' also stated that: "Recently, participants in a 'field
investigation' of the area near Archuleta Mesa, were confronted by two
small hovering spheres. They all became suddenly ill and had to leave the
area.

"We have passed the point of no return in our interaction with the 'alien'
[i.e. 'reptilian gray'] beings. We are guaranteed a crisis which will
persist until the final REVELATION [or conflict].

"The crisis is here, global and real. We must mitigate or transform the
nature of the disasters to come, and come they will. Knowing is half the
battle. Read the book, THE COSMIC CONSPIRACY, by Stan Deyo..."
