                Extreme-Nationalist Organizations In Europe

     There's quite a few Nationalistic groups working within Europe. 
On
 this page, I will be trying to present most of them. If you have any
information about groups, or if you see that I have left something out,
then please feel free to email me.

            The addresses for the various groups will be left out of here
for the simple fact that I think they already have enough members.

I cannot recall the name of the page nor the E-Mail address, however 
I believe the contents of the file itself are important none-the-less,
especially in regards to the re-surgence of fascism in Europe. -
