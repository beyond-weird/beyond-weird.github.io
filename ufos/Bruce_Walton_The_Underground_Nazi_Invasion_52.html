At the conclusion of World War Two, American investigators learned that
Nazi doctors at the Dachau concentration camp in Germany had been
conducting mind control experiments on inmates. They experi- mented with
hypnosis and with the drug mescaline.

Mescaline is a quasi-synthetic extract of the peyote cactus, and is very
similar to LSD in the hallucinations which it produces. Though they did not
achieve the degree of success they had desired, the SS interrogators in
conjunction with the Dachau doctors were able to extract the most intimate
secrets from the prisoners when the inmates were given very high doses of
mescaline.

There were fatal mind control experiments conducted at Auschwitz. The
experiments there were described by one informant as "brainwashing with
chemicals". The informant said the Gestapo wasn't satisfied with extracting
information by torture. "So the next question was, why don't we do it like
the Russians, who have been able to get confessions of guilt at their show
trials?" They tried various barbiturates and morphine derivatives. After
prisoners were fed a coffee-like substance, two of them died in the night
and others died later.

The Dachau mescaline experiments were written up in a lengthy report issued
by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission, whose job it was at the conclusion of
the war to scour all of Europe for every shred of industrial and scientific
material that had been produced by the Third Reich. It was as a result of
this report that the U.S. Navy became interested in mescaline as an
interrogation tool. The Navy initiated Project Chatter in 1947, the same
year the Central Intelligence Agency was formed. The Chatter format
included developing methods for acquiring information from people against
their will, but without inflicting harm or pain.

At the conclusion of the war, the OSS was designated as the investigative
unit for the International Military Tribunal, which was to become known as
the Nuremberg Trials. The purpose of Nuremberg was to try the principal
Nazi leaders. Some Nazis were on trial for their experiments, and the U.S.
was using its own "truth drugs" on these principal Nazi prisoners, namely
Goring, Ribbentrop, Speer and eight others. The Justice in charge of the
tribunal had given the OSS permission to use the drugs.

The Dachau doctors who performed the mescaline experiments also were
involved in aviation medicine. The aviation experiments at Dachau fasci-
nated Heinrich Himmler. Himmler followed the progress of the tests, studied
their findings and often suggested improvements. The Germans had a keen
interest in several medical problems in the field of flying, they were
interested in preventing pilots from slowly becoming unconscious as a
result of breathing the thin air of the high altitudes and there was
interest in enhancing night vision.

The main research in this area was at the Institute of Aviation in Munich,
which had excellent laboratories. The experiments in relationship to the
Institute were conducted at Dachau. Inmates had been immersed in tubs of
ice water with instruments placed in their orifices in order to monitor
their painful deaths. Dr. Hubertus Strughold, who ran the German aviation
medicine team, confirmed that he had heard humans were used for the Dachau
experiments. Hidden in a cave in Hallein were files recording the Dachau
experiments.

On May 15, 1941, Dr. Sigmund Rascher wrote a letter to Himmler requesting
permission to use the Dachau inmates for experiments on the physiology of
high altitudes. Rascher lamented the fact that no such experiments have
been done using human subjects. "The experiments are very dangerous and we
cannot attract volunteers," he told Himmler. His request was approved.

Dachau was filled with Communists and Social Democrats, Jews, Jehovah's
Witnesses, Gypsies, [Protestant] clergymen, homosexuals, and people
critical of the Nazi government. Upon entering Dachau, prisoners lost all
legal status, their hair was shaved off, all their possessions confis-
cated, they were poorly fed, and they were used as slaves for both the
corporations and the government. The SS guards were brutal and sadistic.
The idea to test subjects at Dachau was really the brain child of Erich
Hippke, chief surgeon of the Luftwaffe.

Between March and August of 1942 extensive experiments were conducted at
Dachau regarding the limits of human endurance at high altitudes. These
experiments were conducted for the benefit of the German Air Force. The
experiments took place in a low-pressure chamber in which altitudes of up
to 68,000 feet could be simulated. The subjects were placed in the chamber
and the altitude was raised, many inmates died as a result. The survivors
often suffered serious injury. One witness at the Nuremberg trails, Anton
Pacholegg, who was sent to Dachau in 1942, gave an eye- witness account of
the typical pressure test:

"The Luftwaffe delivered a cabinet constructed of wood and metal. It was
possible in the cabinet to either decrease or increase the air pressure.
You could observe through a little window the reaction of the subject
inside the chamber. The purpose of these experiments was to test human
energy and the subject's capacity...to take large amounts of pure oxygen,
and then to test his reaction to a gradual decrease in oxygen. I have
personally seen through the observation window of the chamber when a
prisoner inside would stand a vacuum until his lungs ruptured. Some
experiments gave men such pressure in their heads that they would go mad
and pull out their hair in an effort to relieve the pressure. They would
tear their heads and face with their fingers and nails in an attempt to
maim themselves in their madness. They would beat the walls with their
hands and head and scream in an effort to relieve pressure in their
eardrums. These cases of extreme vacuums generally ended in the death of
the subjects." The former prisoner also testified, "An extreme experiment
was so certain to result in death that in many instances the chamber was
used for routine execution purposes rather than an experi- ment." A minimum
200 prisoners were known to have died in these experiments.

The doctors directly involved with the research held very high positions:
Karl Brandt was Hitler's personal doctor; Oskar Schroeder was the Chief of
the Medical Services of the Luftwaffe; Karl Gebhardt was Chief Surgeon on
the Staff of the Reich Physician SS and Police and German Red Cross
President; Joachim Mrugowsky was Chief of the Hygienic Institute of the
Waffen SS; Helmut Poppendick was a senior colonel in the SS and Chief of
the Personal Staff of the Reich Physicians SS and Police; Siegfried Ruff
was Director of the Department of Aviation Medicine.

The first human guinea pig was a 37 year old Jew in good health. Him- mler
invited 40 top Luftwaffe officers to view a movie of an inmate dying in the
pressure chamber. After the pressure chamber tests, the cold treatment
experi- ments began. The experiments consisted of immersing inmates in
freezing water while their vital signs were monitored. The goal was to
discover the cause of death. Heart failure was the answer. An inmate
described the procedures:

"The basins were filled with water and ice was added until the water
measured 37.4 F and the experimental subjects were either dressed in a
flying suit or were placed in the water naked. The temperature was measured
rectally and through the stomach. The lowering of the body temperature to
32 degrees was terrible for experimental subjects. At 32 degrees the
subject lost conscious- ness. They were frozen to 25 degrees. The worst
experiment was performed on two Russian officer POWs. They were placed in
the basin naked. Hour after hour passed, and while usually after a short
time, 60 minutes, freezing had set in, these two Russians were still
conscious after two hours. After the third hour one Russian told the other,
'Comrade, tell that officer to shoot us.' The other replied, 'Don't expect
any mercy from this Fascist dog.' Then they shook hands and said goodbye.
The experiment lasted at least five hours until death occurred.

Dry freezing experiments were also carried out a Dachau. One subject was
put outdoors on a stretcher at night when it was extremely cold. While
covered with a linen sheet, a bucket of cold water was poured over him
every hour. He was kept outdoors undersub-freezing conditions. In
subsequent experiments, subjects were simply left outside naked in a court
under freez- ing conditions for hours. Himmler gave permission to move the
experiments to Auschwitz, because it was more private and because the
subjects of the experiment would howl all night as they froze. The physical
pain of freezing was terrible. The subjects died by inches, heartbeat
became totally irregular, breathing difficulties and lung endema resulted,
hands and feet became frozen white."

As the Germans began to lose the war, the aviation doctors began too keep
their names from appearing in Himmler's files for fear of future
recriminations.

America made it to the moon with Dachau research

The Nazi doctors who experimented on the inmates of prison camps during
World War Two were tried for murder at the Nuremberg Tribunal. The accused
were educated, trained physicians, they did not kill in anger or in malice,
they were creating a science of death.

Ironically, in 1933, the Nazi's passed a law for the protection of animals.
The law cited the prevention of cruelty and indifference to animals as one
of the highest moral values of a people, animal experimentation was
unthinkable, but human experimentations were acceptable. The victims of the
crime of these doctors numbered into the thousands.

In 1953, while the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY was still con- ducting mind
control and behavior modification on unwitting humans in this country, the
United States signed the Nuremberg Code, a code born out of the ashes of
war and human suffering. The document was a solemn promise never to
tolerate such human atrocities again. The Code maintains three fundamental
principles:

   * The subjects of any experimentation must be volunteers who thoroughly
     understand the purpose and the dangers of the experiments. They must
     be free to give consent and the consent must be without pressure and
     they must be free to quit the experiments at any time.

     (In regards to the Nazi-based CIA experiments, MK-ULTRA and the
     mind-control projects which followed, the CIA has failed in all three
     of these areas. - Wol.)
   * The experiments must be likely to yield knowledge which is valuable to
     everyone. The knowledge must be such that it could not be gained in
     any other way.

   * The experiments must be conducted by only the most competent doctors,
     and they must exercise extreme care.

The Nazi aviation experiments met none of these conditions. Most inmates at
Dachau knew that the experiments in the pressure chamber were fatal. From
the very beginning, control of the experiments was largely in the hands of
the SS, which was later judged to be a criminal organization by the
Nuremberg Tribunal.

Despite our lessons from Nuremberg and the death camps, the CIA, U.S. Navy
and the U.S. Army Chemical Corps targeted specific groups of people for
experimentation who were not able to resist, prisoners, mental patients,
foreigners, ethnic minorities, sex deviants, the terminally ill, children
and U.S. military personnel and prisoners of war. They VIOLATED the Nurem-
berg Code for conducting and subsidizing experiments on unwitting citizens.
The CIA began its mind control projects in 1953, the very year that the
U.S. signed the Nuremberg Code and pledged with the international community
of nations to respect basic human rights and to prohibit experimentation on
captive populations without full and free consent.

Dr. Cameron, a CIA operative, was one of the worst offenders against the
Code, yet he was a member of the Nuremberg Tribunal, with full knowledge of
its testimony. In 1973, a three judge court in Michigan ruled,
"...experimental psychosurgery, which is irreversible and intrusive, often
leads to the blunting of emotions, the deadening of memory, the reduction
of affect, and limits the ability to generate new ideas. Its potential for
injury to the creativity of the individual is great and can infringe on the
right of the individual to be free from interference with his mental
process.

"The state's interest in performing psychosurgery and the legal ability of
the involuntarily detained mental patient to give consent, must bow to the
First Amendment, which protects the generation and free flow of ideas from
unwarranted interference with one's mental processes." Citing the Nuremberg
Code, the court found that "the very nature of the subject's incarceration
dimini- shes the capacity to consent to psychosurgery." In 1973, the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted regulations which would require
informed written consent from voluntary patients before electroshock
treatment could be per- formed.

Senator Sam Ervin's Committee lashed out bitterly at the mind control and
behavior modification experiments and ordered them discontinued, they WERE
NOT. But the New England Journal of Medicine states, that the consent
provisions are "no more than an elaborate ritual." They called it "a device
that when the subject is uneducated and uncomprehending, confers no more
than a semblance of propriety on human experimentation."

The Nuremberg Tribunal brought to light that some of the most respected
figures in the medical profession were involved in the vast crime network
of the SS. ONLY 23 persons were charged with criminal activity in this
area, despite the fact that hundreds of medical personnel were involved.
The defendants were charged with crimes against humanity. They were found
guilty of planning and executing experiments on humans without their
consent, in a cruel and brutal manner which involved severe torture,
deliberate murder and with the full knowledge of the gravity of their
deeds. ONLY seven of the defendants were sentenced to death and hanged,
others received life sen- tences. Five who were involved in the experiments
were not tried. Ernest Grawitz committed suicide, Carl Clauberg was tried
in the Soviet Union, Josef Mengele escaped to South America and was later
captured by Israeli agents, Horst Schumann disappeared and Siegmund Rascher
was executed by Himmler.

There were 200 German medical doctors conducting these medical experiments.
Most of these doctors were friends of the United States [medical
establishment] before the war, and despite their inhuman experiments, the
U.S. attempted to rebuild a relationship with them after the war. The know-
ledge the Germans had accumulated at the expense of human life and
suffering, was considered a "booty of war", by the Americans and the
Russians.The 'Americans' tracked down Dr. Strughold, the aviation doctor
who was in charge of the Dachau experiments. With full knowledge that the
experiments were conducted on captive humans, the U.S. recruited the
doctors to work for them. General Dwight D. Eisenhower (whose presidency
was sponsored and financially backed by the Rockefellers. - Wol.) gave his
personal approval to exploit the work and research of the Nazi's in the
death camps.

Within weeks of Eisenhower's order, many of these notorious doctors were
working for the U.S. Army at Heidelberg. Army teams scoured Europe for
scientific experimental apparatus such as pressure chambers, compressors,
G-force machines, giant centrifuges, and electron microscopes. These
doctors were wined and dined by the U.S. Army while most of Germany's
post-war citizens virtually starved.

The German doctors were brought to the U.S. and went to work for Project
Paperclip. ALL these doctors had been insulated against war crime charges.
The Nuremberg prosecutors were SHOCKED that 'U.S. authorities' were using
the German doctors despite their criminal past.

Under the leadership of Strughold, 34 scientists accepted contracts from
Project Paperclip, and were moved to Randolph Air Force Base at San
Antonio, Texas. The authorization to hire these Nazi scientists came
directly for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The top military brass stated that
they wished to exploit these rare minds. Project Paperclip, ironically,
would use Nazi doctors to develop methods of interrogating German prisoners
of war.

As hostilities began to build after the war between the Americans and the
Russians, the U.S. imported as many as 1000 former Nazi scientists.

(In their over-confidence, the 'government' officials assumed that these
'scientists' would immediately give up their Nazi belief system and convert
to the Constitu- tional ideology. Those government officials involved --
excepting for the Project Paperclip personnel, Nazi fifth columnists and
double agents working within the American government with the Rockefellers
and other American Nazis -- must have assumed that with the Neuremberg
trials and de-Nazification operations of Europe, the entire Nazi network
had been extinguished, and therefore there was no danger of these 1000 plus
Nazi scientists collaborating with a secret Nazi underground which intended
to carry through on Adolph Hitler's plans in spite of their apparent
'defeat' in Europe. - Wol.) In 1969, Americans landed on the moon, and two
groups of scientist in the control center shared the credit, the rocket
team from Peenemunde, Germany, under the leadership of Werner von Braun,
these men had perfected the V-2s which were built in the Nordhausen caves
where 20,000 slave laborers from prison camp Dora had been worked to death.
The second group were the space doctors, lead by 71-year-old Dr. Hubertus
Strughold, whose work was pioneered in Experimental Block No. 5 of the
Dachau concentration camp and the torture and death of hundreds of inmates.
The torture chambers that was used to slowly kill the prisoners of the
Nazi's were the test beds for the apparatus that protected Neil Armstrong
from harm, from lack of oxygen, and pressure, when he walked on the moon.

Although most of the file deals with CIA mind control research and one
could reason that 'NAZI' and 'CIA' are synonymous, I've cited only those
passages dealing directly 'NAZI' mind control experimentation. - Wol.]
...The navy became interested in mescaline as an interrogation agent when
American investigators learned of mind control experiments carried out by
Nazi doctors at the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. After
administering the hallucinogen to 30 prisoners, the Nazis con- cluded that
it was "impossible to impose one's will on another person as in hypnosis
even when the strongest dose of mescaline had been given." (Note: The
danger in hypnosis is that it can -- through the power of suggestion --
induce an alternate perspective on reality, and a person's mind could be
programmed in such a way that the programming process itself is forgotten.
Therefore a person could be programmed to believe for example that they are
having a bad 'nightmare' and that the one causing the nightmare is an evil
monster who must be killed 'in the dream'. Drug-induced hypnosis can
confuse a person's perceptions of the lines between reality and unreality,
and 'voices' giving instructions could be interpreted to be of their own
creation or from a supernatural 'source' when in fact the instructions are
hypnotically-induced. So then, even though the 'will' remains intact, the
individual could be moved to commit atrocities which they would not
normally commit whether because the scenario is made out to be a 'dream' or
whether they are programmed to see the 'target' as an evil monster who must
be van- quished in order to save the country, the world, and so on.
People's choices are highly dependent on their perception or context of
reality. If the true reality context is altered to a false reality context,
such as described above, they could be moved to commit atrocities that they
normally would not commit in a state of normal lucidity, such as assas-
sination, etc. - Wol). But the drug still afforded certain advantages to SS
interrogators, who were consistently able to draw "even the most intimate
secrets from the [subject] when questions where cleverly put." Not
surprisingly, "sentiments of hatred and revenge were exposed in every
case." The mescaline experiments at Dachau were described in a lengthy
report by the US Naval Technical Mission, which swept across Europe in
search of every scrap of industrial material and scientific data that could
be garnered from the fallen Reich. This mission set the stage for the
whole- sale importation of more than 600 top Nazi scientists under the
auspices of Project paperclip -- which THE CIA SUPERVISED during the early
years of the Cold War. Among those who emigrated to the US in such a
fashion was Dr Hubertus Strughold, the German scientist whose chief
subordinates (Dr Sigmund Ruff and Dr Sigmund Rascher) were directly
involved in "aviation medicine" experiments at Dachau, which included the
mescaline studies. Despite recurring allegations that he sanctioned medical
atrocities during the war, Strughold settled in Texas and became an
important figure in America's space program. After Werner von Braun, he was
the top Nazi scientist employed by the American government, and he was
subsequently hailed by NASA as the "father of space medi- cine"... Like the
Nazi doctors at Dachau, the CIA victimized certain groups of people, who
were unable to resist: prisoners, mental patients, foreigners, the
terminally ill, sexual deviants, ethnic minorities...
