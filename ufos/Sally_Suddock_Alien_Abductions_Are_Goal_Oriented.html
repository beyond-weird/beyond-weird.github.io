Alien Abductions are Goal Oriented By Sally Suddock

One of the leading researchers investigating the alien abduction phenomenon said
Saturday that he believes that a significant majority of such abductions are a
goal-oriented, planned program with the ultimate purpose of spreading alien
hybrids laterally through the Earth's population. "Take everything I say with a
boulder of salt," said David Jacobs at the Bay Area UFO Expo in San Jose,
California. "In fact, you should take everything all of us (UFO and ET)
researchers say with a boulder of salt, because there are no UFO research
standards" and a flock of theories on both phenomena, he cautioned his audience
before offering his analysis of some 130 abduction cases he's studied.  Jacobs
was among 19 featured speakers at the conference over the weekend that reached
not only an expected 3,000 registrants at the Double Tree Hotel, but potentially
thousands through a webcast of the proceedings over the Internet at
https://.ufocommunity.com.

Jacobs related numerous common experiences reported by abductees he has
interviewed through the process of regression through hypnosis. He said he's
worked with more than 130 individuals and more than 800 sessions of regression
over the past 35 years, all of which has led him to the conclusion that the
cases are part of an overall, planned program by one or more alien races that
has been occurring for approximately 100 years. A professor of history at Temple
University, Jacobs holds a doctorate degree and has authored several papers on
the phenomenon, the history of UFO encounters, and published this month with the
University of Kansas: UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of
Knowledge."

Virtually all of the abductees in his research recalled being placed on a table
and undergoing procedures with devices extending from the ceiling or walls or
wielded by the aliens.  They have a strong sense that sperm or eggs have been
taken during these procedures. In some cases, women have recalled fetal
extractions. They describe the beings as having extremely small mouths and
noses, but oversized, almond-shaped eyes. They vividly recall aliens staring at
them, at extremely close range, and the sense of becoming one with the being
through some kind of optical, neurological connection. And, virtually all the
subjects Jacobs has studied experience "missing time" during the period in which
they were taken.  Virtually all of these individuals cannot recall the
experience in normal consciousness, and many, said Jacobs, believe they hold
"some kind of unnerving knowledge" that they cannot remember, even under
hypnosis.

Other commonalities also have emerged, says Jacobs. For one, most abduction
victims have undergone the experience from early childhood and the abductions
have continued through their adulthood. Most, he said, also have earlier family
members who were abductees--in short, he said, the phenomenon appears to be
intergenerational. "We have seen no adult-onset single events," he said of his
and other researchers' findings about the phenomenon.

"These abductions occur at infancy or toddler stage to a certain point of
age--seldom beyond 80 years," he said. "We believe it's a program of 'mining'
and 'harvesting' human reproductive cells. The conclusion is clear, he said,
from frequent reports from abductees that they've seen "hybrid" beings during
their experiences that resemble neither human nor alien. Further, he said, "the
intergenerational phenomenon is a bombshell idea," discovered by his colleague
Budd Hopkins, who also spoke at the conference. Jacobs said he asked a colleague
who is a mathematician to calculate the number of generations it would take to
abduct Earth's population. "I asked him to calculate how many generations it
would be before everybody's an abductee," said Jacobs. "He said 7 generations,"
assuming no intermarriages between hybrids, but rather a "lateral" project of
abduction. "If you work that backwards, this phenomenon could not have begun
with the ancients," such as has been suggested about alien influence on Egyptian
culture, for example. His colleague's 7-generations calculations led Jacobs to
conclude that the alien program began some 100 years ago. And, he added, there
are "significant amounts of evidence in family stories of this kind from this
period."

Jacobs believes that alien abductions "began as a small program, but has grown
much larger--"when you consider that abductees experience never less than 11
incidents per year--the dimensions of this tell you there's a lot going on
here." He added that abductees report seeing "aircraft-hanger-sized rooms with
20, 200, even 500 tables of procedures occurring."

Are there alien hybrids among us? Jacobs believes that the answer is a certain
affirmative. "There is ample evidence," he said. "Now what we must determine
whether this phenomenon is a threat. Science should be looking at questions such
as 'who are the abductors and what is their role' on the evolution of societies
in the future.
