R 12 : *SYSTEM*             | Switching to Aliens&Society Co
       John Carpenter       | Tonight we are going to talk
                            | about many things
                            | including alien types, origins,
                            | and the case in Brazil
                            | which demonstrates ANOTHER type of entity. ga
       Mudwasp              | ?
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Mudwasp ga
       Mudwasp              | What case in Brazil?
       VINNY                | ?
       John Carpenter       | Well, that certainly tells you all how NEW
                            | this case really is!!! Okay,
       Mudwasp              | :)
       John Carpenter       | there was an alleged crash in the country of
                            | Brazil, South America around January 19, 1996 
                            | near
                            | a city called Varginhia (180,000 people).
                            | As many as 5-6 creatures were either seen or
                            | captured by various military or other 
                            | officials.
       Mudwasp              | ?
       John Carpenter       | There are at least 35 first-hand witnesses. ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Vinny ga
        Ann F./ExecSYSOP    | ?
       Mudwasp              | What is the evidence that they are 
                            | otherworldly creatures?
       VINNY                | are  these  the same  entities  that  were  
                            | caught in 
                            | florida?sorry  good evening  John glad to see 
                            | you, 
                            | forgot my manners, the creatures  spoke  in  
                            | a 
                            | language that  we cant understand?
       John Carpenter       | First, Mud's question...
       VINNY                | ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | ga Mudwasp
       John Carpenter       | The description is: 4-5 feet tall, brown skin 
                            | which
                            | glistened as if oiled, large round RED eyes,
                            | no hair, oversize heads, several bumps or 
                            | "horns" 
                            | on the heads,
                            | very long arms, skinny naked body, sexless,
                            | long 3-fingered hands, V-shaped feet. ga
                            | Oh...
                            | and they made a buzzing sound like bees after
                            | captured in nets.
                            | ga
       Mudwasp              | bizarre.
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Vinny ga
       VINNY                | are they the same creatures  caught in  
                            | florida?
       John Carpenter       | What creatures were CAUGHT in Florida?
       Mudwasp              | Drug Dealers.
                            | JK.
       VINNY                | the  same way  these  others were caught  a  
                            | few 
                            | kids were throwing rocks at them
                            | the firemen came and swooped them away
       John Carpenter       | When?
       VINNY                | in big nets
                            | two of them were caught
                            | a month  or so ago
       Mudwasp              | Since when do firemen know how to deal with 
                            | Aliens?
       John Carpenter       | Wait a minute....
       VINNY                |  the second one seemed  to speak  a  language 
                            | we 
                            | didnt understand
                            | ga
       John Carpenter       | Okay ... whoa ...
       VINNY                | ga
       Susan Mims           | ?
       John Carpenter       | Let me explain...
                            | I was just in Brazil and talked first-hand to 
                            | the
                            | principal investigators. What you just 
                            | described
                            | is exactly what happened in Brazil on January 
                            | 20,
       VINNY                | there  was  only two  beings  caught , there 
                            | were two 
                            | stories  i had  the one from brazil before
                            | this one is different
       John Carpenter       | 1996. In Brazil you do not call 911, you call 
                            | the fire 
                            | department who take care of all kinds of
                            | odd things -- large snakes, mad dogs, and in 
                            | this
       VINNY                | were three girls  involved  in brazil?
       John Carpenter       | case, what they thought were "odd monkeys" 
                            | until
                            | closer look. Yes, the three girls were 
                            | involved.
       VINNY                | ok  then there is  another story
                            | one in florida
       John Carpenter       | So this is not Florida, but BRAZIL, okay 
                            | everyone?
                            | Now...
                            | Let's come back to this case a little later, 
                            | okay?
       VINNY                | ga
                            | sorry
        Di&Jack/SL5         | ok Susan
       Susan Mims           | How reliable do you think the information 
                            | source is?  Are 
                            | there any pictures, artifacts, etc., to 
                            | support the stories? 
                            | Any footprints, landing marks, etc.?
        Di&Jack/SL5         | ga
       John Carpenter       | ok...
                            | They have taped interviews with military 
                            | officials,
                            | 1000 pages of testimony from 35 witnesses,
       Mudwasp              | ?
       John Carpenter       | including other officials, civilians, Air 
                            | Force, etc.
       John Carpenter       | There were footprints, odors, bodies 
                            | recovered and 
                            | examined in the hospital, etc etc. ga
       Susan Mims           | Bodies recovered?
       VINNY                | ?
       Mudwasp              | ?
       John Carpenter       | Yes, bodies were recovered -- at least two 
                            | dead and 
                            | two alive... interesting, eh?
       Susan Mims           | ?
       John Carpenter       | Two more have been seen BUT NOT CAPTURED 
                            | as far as we know at this point ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Okay Mudwasp, you are next, ga
       Mudwasp              | ga.
       John Carpenter       | Brazil (Varginhia is the city)
        Di&Jack/SL5         | This is a formal conference, use a ? 
                            | to ask a question and wait til you 
                            | are called on
       Mudwasp              | Were any witnesses not in the Military?
                            | and if so, what happened to them?
       John Carpenter       | yes, most of them were in the neighborhood, 
                            | on the 
                            | streets, near the hospital, in the hospital, 
                            | or part of 
                            | the medical unit, etc.
                            | They...
                            | have been threatened not to talk. Several of 
                            | the
                            | investigators have had their lives threatened.
       Mudwasp              | By the Military?
       John Carpenter       | Folks, this is not INTERNET rumor. This is 
                            | fact as I 
                            | just interviewed in person
       System Crash         | ?
       John Carpenter       | the principal investigator while I was at a 
                            | UFO
                            | conference in Brazil. He told me his life had 
                            | been
                            | threatened. He was the one who taped the 
                            | interviews with the military.
                            | And he has wisely duplicated these and 
                            | distributed
                            | them safely to many places. Good move! ga
       - Visitor            | Mr. Carpenter, do you know about the shadow 
                            | shaped in the letter A,B, or C found next to 
                            | the Viking 
                            | that went to Mars during the late 70's...?  
                            | They 
                            | thought it might have been some lifeform but 
                            | I don't 
                            | know if they ever determined anything 
                            | definite from 
                            | it...?  APOLOGIES:  I ALREADY TYPED MY 
                            | QUESTION...(next time?)
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Wow, Thanks John, Vinny, you are 
                            | next, ga
       VINNY                | John  do u  think  that  we  are  on  the  
                            | brink  on  the 
                            | ufo  reality comming  forth?All the  movies, 
                            | shows,commercials,etc,etc are we upon the 
                            | time  or 
                            | is it that the government cant controll?Do 
                            | you  think 
                            | my  theory  is  somewhat correct  that  the 
                            | earths 
                            | atmosphere is  thinning out and the 
                            | dimensional 
                            | portal  is wearing thin?Things  are starting 
                            | to just"fall 
                            | out"?
       John Carpenter       | It certainly feels like many more entities are
       Mudwasp              | 8%7)q
       John Carpenter       | coming through from somewhere. First all the 
                            | Chupacabras in Puerto Rico,
       John Carpenter       | Juarez, Mexico, and Florida. Now these 
                            | somewhat
                            | related creatures in Brazil who seem like a 
                            | cross 
                            | between the Chupacabras and Little Greys! ga
       John Carpenter       | okay...
       VINNY                | ?
       John Carpenter       | Roswell is and always will be an excellent 
                            | case with 
                            | many (300) witnesses from civilians
                            | to military personnel. Brigadier General 
                            | Jefferson 
                            | Dubose stated on videotape before his death
                            | that it was a coverup ABSOLUTELY of a strange 
                            | craft from another world. He was
                            | General Ramey's assistant and would KNOW.
                            | However,
                            | the autopsy film is NOT Roswell at all.
       System Crash         | ?
       John Carpenter       | It is dated as a crash on May 31, 1947 whereas
       John Carpenter       | Roswell was July 5-7th, 1947. It was also 
                            | supposed 
                            | to be 
       John Carpenter       | southwest of Soccorro. But the film
                            | does not look like any of the aliens from 
                            | thousands
                            | of researched cases. This does not mean that 
                            | it is 
                            | not possibly real, but we have nothing like 
                            | it before 
                            | despite
                            | years of research by so many investigators...
                            | The other bothersome thing...
                            | is that Santilli and others have not exactly 
                            | been
                            | clear on many aspects. Their stories are full 
                            | of 
                            | holes and disappointments. 
       System Crash         | With this obvious mistake, why would people

       John Carpenter       | The jury is still out but most serious UFO

       John Carpenter       | It was only a popular label that stuck.
       VINNY                | Were these  beings  nasty, from what iheard 
                            | they 
                            | were scared to death?What was at the crash  
                            | sight 
                            | noone  heard anything about this , everyone 
                            | was 
                            | focussed on the beings!!!Were they wearing 
       John Carpenter       | Vinney?
       VINNY                | cloths?Could they be govenment  experiments 
                            | that " 
                            | got away'?
       John Carpenter       | Which beings?
       VINNY                | theones  in brazil
       John Carpenter       | okay..
                            | It would not seem as likely that they were the
                            | pilots of the craft -- they seemed more 
                            | primitive and 
                            | helpless ... however
                            | they may have been "cargo" or...
                            | android workers.... or possibly very 
                            | intelligent but
                            | just in shock --- just like a business 
                            | executive
                            | wandering around like a lost child after a

       System Crash         | Is it true that the government of the US has 
                            | a "safe zone" in which no one cane enter, 
                            | unless 
                            | they have a very high security level, and it 
                            | is in this zone, that they are crossing alien 
                            | DNA with 
                            | human DNA to create some sort of human-alien

       - Visitor            | !!!!!!!!!!
       System Crash         | What??  I found that info on a web page!
       John Carpenter       | Good question.... It is interesting to note...
                            | that one of the largest genetic research 
                            | centers
                            | is in Puerto Rico where so many Chupacabras
                            | were first seen.... hmmm... ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Thanks John, Channing Jones, ga
       Channing Jones       | John, what do you think about the various 
                            | ancient civilization theories such as 
                            | Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu, etc.
       System Crash         | ?
       John Carpenter       | I have been looking very closely at ancient 
                            | stuff and 
       Susan Mims           | ?
       John Carpenter       | have found fascinating depictions of what 
                            | seem to 
                            | be obvious UFO sightings, abductions, etc. I 
                            | think
                            | that these beings have been visiting our 
                            | Earth ever 
                            | since we "came here"...<g>     ga
       System Crash         | What about the all infamous LOCH NESS MONSTER 
                            | hmm John?
       John Carpenter       | Is Crash next?
       Cool Jerk            | ?
        Di&Jack/SL5         | System, there are other questions 
                            | please wait until you are called on
       System Crash         | Sorry, I thought I was.
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Go ahead Susan
       Susan Mims           | Where are the live Brazil beings now?  Are 
                            | there pictures of 
                            | either the live or dead beings?  and did you 
                            | see them?  has 
                            | anyone threatened you, yet?
        Di&Jack/SL5         | then System 
       John Clark           | ?
       John Carpenter       | It is believed that one live being MAY have 
                            | been 
                            | brought back to the USA. There is one
                            | military witness who stated that the USA 
                            | informed
                            | the Brazilian miltary that an object had come 
                            | down
                            | and what to do -- until they got there? 
                            | Anyway, the 
                            | US is supposed to have overseen the 
                            | operation. 
                            | Does
                            | that really surprise anyone? I did not see 
                            | the bodies
                            | myself but saw numerous drawings from several 
                            | witnesses. 
        Di&Jack/SL5         | System Crash, GA
       John Carpenter       | They said that the incident WAS filmed well, 
                            | but
        Di&Jack/SL5         | sorry JOhn
       John Carpenter       | the investigators do not have the footage 
                            | yet. Now,
                            | you must realize that I was impressed by the 
                            | UFO
                            | investigators there -- some of them have been 
                            | very 
                            | diligent and dedicated for decades to this
                            | mystery and do a very fine, competent job! In 
                            | fact,
                            | Brazil has 182 UFO groups! Imagine! And they 
                            | have
                            | at least 40 MUFON members as well.    ga
       System Crash         | Do you think that one day others from 
                            | different worlds will come in full force? And 
                            | if so, do you 
                            | have any idea if they will come in peace, or 
                            | as a hostile act?  Also, any opinion on when 
                            | they 
                            | will come?

       Channing Jones       | ?
       John Carpenter       | We have no evidence of any hostility or

                            | ago.
       System Crash         | What a releif!
       John Carpenter       | No researcher is finding this kind of 
                            | indication or

                            | is it just a case of the more we learn the 
                            | faster we

       John Carpenter       | the latter, I believe, plus what we gain from 
                            | such

       John Clark           | I'm from New Jersey and was wondering if you

                            | about Big Foot?  thanks:)
       John Carpenter       | I think the Jersey Devil may give us some 
                            | history 
                            | finally on the Chupacabras mystery. When the 
                            | Brazilian 3 girls saw the crouching creature, 
                            | they felt 
                            | they had seen the devil and ran away. ga

       Channing Jones       | Don't you think movies such as Independence

                            | in people's minds -- and then found in the

                            | perhaps the very next day!  Now...

                            | response. The astronauts who returned from the
                            | moon often had a deeply religious experience.
                            | I have talked with Ed Mitchell. You MUST read

        Di&Jack/SL5         | Thank you John, Aitan, you are next,

        Aitan R./SL3        | In all your experience, what spect of 
                            | humanity seems to be affected the most, and 
                            | are there any noticeable changes in the way 
                            | people think now about all this, compared to 
                            | ten years ago? Is there an acceleration?
                            | aspect that is.
       John Carpenter       | AWARENESS and EDUCATION have been GREAT
                            | largely due to the media's improved posture 
                            | toward 
                            | all of this...
                            | Journalistic greats such as George Knapp, 
                            | Linda

                            | and even Art Bell's Dreamland, plus SIGHTINGS,
                            | ENCOUNTERS, UNSOLVED MYSTERIES, and
                            | X-FILES to name just a few. As the networks 
                            | have 
                            | treated it more seriously,
                            | more people have felt comfortable to finally 
                            | tell their
        Aitan R./SL3        | !
       John Carpenter       | long-kept secret accounts. Thus, it appears 
                            | as if
                            | there is a great increase in encounters
                            | when actually
                            | there has been a flood of REPORTING -- many

                            | Why do you feel Gordon Cooper has spoken out 
                            | now 
                            | about UFO's? What could be his motivation?
                            | ?

       Channing Jones       | I would like to get back to D Slade's 
                            | question. Occasionally aliens have been 
                            | reported mentioning such things as 
                            | reincarnation such as in the Adams and Meier 
                            | cases. What do you think of this? Is there a 
                            | connection to Religion?
       John Carpenter       | Well, now that is a big question indeed!!! 
                            | okay...
                            | In my own searching I have found nearly every 
                            | religion
                            | influenced by some kind of other-worldly 
                            | encounter.
                            | I really wonder about "angels" and "tall

       John Carpenter       | I wonder about reptilians
                            | and the serpents from Biblical times. After 
                            | all, when 
                            | God said that NOW the serpent must crawl on 
                            | his 
                            | belly,
                            | what was he doing previously?

                            | It is VERY strange indeed!   ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Good answer John, Aitan, ga
        Aitan R./SL3        | Regarding the media, its an indication that 
                            | the mass public is interested.

       Daniel Roberts       | Thank you, John answered my question...about

       John Carpenter       | Jasher? Lost book of the Bible?

       ECL Robin            | Good point about the serpents on their

                            | About reincarnation and spirituality,  I 
                            | recently had 
                            | regression hypnosis and discovered a memory 
                            | of an 
                            | ET encounter in 1265 AD in which I was 
                            | invited and 
                            | accepted the invitation to go their craft.  I 
                            | recieved an 
                            | implant which causes pain to this day, but 
                            | the pain is 
                            | a teaching tool for something specific. In 
                            | your 
                            | knowledge, Is this sort of experience fairly 
                            | common?
       John Carpenter       | Not enough info on that, but very 
                            | interesting. ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | D. Slade, ga
       D Slade              | John, are you saying the origin of  human 
                            | *religion* or worship has evolved  from Et 
                            | contact?  and not from within ourselves? 
                            | Thanks, 
                            | ga
                            | Is this all a fog?
       John Carpenter       | I think there has been a heavy influence -- 
                            | not 
                            | necessarily directly started but inspired. ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | Jeannie, ga
        Jeannie/SL6         | Do you see, or have you seen ANY indication 
                            | that ET"S 
                            | presence will be validated publicly in any 
                            | form at any time in 
                            | the near future?
       John Carpenter       | I would hope so. It would lessen my load!! ga
                            | Oh---
                            | news flash
                            | from Japan
                            | Robert Dean and others
                            | were UN-invited

                            | UFO museum.
                            | They say, "INVITATION ONLY".
                            | Is that not interesting????? ga
        Di&Jack/SL5         | John, that was our last question, we 
                            | can go informal now.  Please feel 
                            | free to stay on and chat.  WE really 
                            | appreciate your being with us 
                            | tonight and the information was 
                            | fascinating, can you join us again?
       John Carpenter       | I am not complacent, I hope. This is part of 
                            | my life 
                            | daily. But
                            | you must remember, I have heard predictions 
                            | and 
                            | prophecies for years even from some of my 
                            | best 
                            | cases
                            | and nothing ever came true. I do believe we 
                            | are
                            | in for some Earth changes and eventual open 
                            | contact,
                            | but I just don't have anything DEFINITE to 
                            | share
                            | with all of you. I must be responsible. After 
                            | all, there 
                            | are enough rumors to last for all of us. I 
                            | try to deal
                            | only with data, encounters, facts, science, 
                            | and the 
                            | effects on people -- including wonderful
       John Carpenter       | spirituality and growth, etc.
                            | Good night everyone. I must go pack for my
                            | trip to Chile, S.A. TOMORROW to speak at their
	                    | first UFO conference -- university sponsored 
                            | and 
                            | also by their Air Force I am told!        
        Ann F./ExecSYSOP    | John, thank you so much!

        Di&Jack/SL5         | Thank you John, it has been a
