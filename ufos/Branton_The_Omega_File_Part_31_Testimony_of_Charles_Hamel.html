                         TESTIMONY OF CHARLES HAMEL

BEFORE THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS COMMITTEE ON INTERIOR AND INSULAR AFFAIRS
2226 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C.
November 4 & 5, 1991

(Note: The following is just one excerpt from the lengthy transcript of the
hearing - Branton):

"...In 1988, ARCO, EXXON and British Petroleum failed to tell this
Committee about the existence of the Pt. McIntyre billion barrel oil field
directly under the West Dock, virtually within sight of the Alyeska
Pipeline, while they were testifying that Prudhoe Bay was running dry. In
fact, both ARCO and EXXON knew that they had discovered the Pt. McIntyre
field years earlier. In 1989, my General Partner, EXXON, told me that our
Pt. McIntyre leases were dry. I sold my interest in the leases for what
EXXON told me was a fair price. Several weeks after selling EXXON my
interests, the major discovery was announced. ONCE AGAIN, they LIED to you,
they LIED to the Congress, they LIED to the public, and they DEFRAUDED us
all."

Here is an interesting report that I came across which suggests that the
fascist conspiracy against America goes 'deeper' than some might dare to
believe:
