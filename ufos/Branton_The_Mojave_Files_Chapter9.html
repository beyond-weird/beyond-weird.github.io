George Adamski, the 1950's "contactee" and alleged Rosicrucian, was one of
several who claimed to have had contacted Aryan-like saucer pilots during
that time period. One little known fact about his contact in the Mojave
desert was that one of the 'footprints' left by the 'man' he encountered in
his initial experience revealed some strange symbols which had apparently
been impressed into the ground from the sole of the aliens' shoe. One
footprint showed two depiction's of a 'swastika'. One inter- pretation is
that the saucer pilots encountered by George Adamski and other contactees
such as George King, George Van Tassel, George Hunt Williamson (apparently
these "E.T.s" have an affinity for those bearing the name "George" -
Branton), Howard Menger, Mel Noel, and others are not Germans in the true
sense of the word. It is believed by some however that the Germans have for
centuries been doing business with a race of ancient ARYANS -- possibly
tied-in with the ancient Aryans who occupied India several thousand years
ago -- or "Arriani", who are part of a high-tech society based in
underground cities near the North and South poles. German occultists in
fact have been known to sabotage polar expeditions of other nations long
before the beginning of World War I. These "Aryans" may have assisted the
Germans with their technology during World War II, although it is uncertain
whether or not they actually agreed with or support- ed Adolph Hitler's
racist genocidal policies. These "Arriani" seem to have some connection
with the so-called "Tribunal" on Saturn, which may explain why plans
discovered for Nazi flying disks revealed one design that was an EXACT
DUPLICATE of the so- called "Venusian" design described and photographed by
Adamski.

In his book 'MESSENGERS OF DECEPTION' (Bantom Books, 1980), Jacques Vallee
relates some disturbing connections between fascist politics and some of
the early 'contactees' of California. According to Vallee, Adamski had
pre-war ties with American fascist leader William Dudley Pelley, who was
interned during the war. Contactee George Hunt Williamson (whose real name
was Michael d'Obrenovic) was associated with Pelly's organization,
'Soulcraft', in the early fifties. Other associates of Williamson during
the great era of the 'flying saucers' were such contactees as John McCoy
and the two Stanford brothers, Ray and Rex. Pelley, who died in 1965, was
the leader of the 'Silver Shirts', an American Nazi group which began it's
activities about 1932. It's membership overlapped strongly with Guy
Ballard's 'I AM' movement based at Mt. Shasta. It was about 1950 that G.H.
Williamson began working for Pelley at the offices of his 'Soulcraft'
Publications, in Noblesville, Indiana, before moving to California, where
he allegedly witnessed Adamski's desert contact in 1952, with a 'Venusian
with long blond hair.'

Former 'Dulce' worker Thomas Castello, who was previously alleged to have
worked as a top secret photo analyst for the Air Force, reported seeing a
photo of a 'disk' with a swastika on it's side!

In all fairness, as we have suggested, it is possible that those who
contacted Adamski were not 'Nazis' as we know them. Perhaps Adolph Hitler
took an ancient and already existing symbol as some suggest and corrupted
it with his own malevolent occultic philosophies. Then again, many of the
claims made to Adamski do not ring true with many scientific UFOlogists,
such as the allegation that the surface of Venus is just as temperate and
mild as the earth itself, and so on. Could those who contacted Adamski have
been using Venus as a 'cover' to hide their true place of origin (perhaps
Antarctica) as other researchers have suggested?

As for the swastika itself, the Hopi Indians of northwest Arizona and the
ancient Hindus, for instance, were apparently using it thousands of years
before the Nazis began to... and some suggest that German occultists may
have borrowed the symbol from them.

The following report appeared in the Sept. 1966 issue of FATE, pages 25 and
28:

"FROM 'DOWN UNDER' -- We suspect this story may be a hoax but we can't
resist reporting it. We have TWO DIFFERENT clippings from Darwin,
Australia, concerning the discovery of animal flesh, hairs and hide during
a well-drilling operation at a depth of 102 feet.

"An experienced well driller, Norman Jenson, was boring for water 15 miles
from Killarney homestead, about 350 miles south of Darwin. He had
penetrated seven layers of limestone, clay, red soil and sandstone when, at
102 feet, the bit of the drill struck something soft and quickly dropped to
111 feet.

Jensen thought the drill had penetrated an underground water course and
lowered a pump to make tests. His pump brought to the surface a bucketful
of what he believed to be flesh, bone, hide and hairs. Jensen told
Constable Roy Harvey he never had seen anything like this before. Some of
the material was given to chickens at Killarney station. They ate it,
apparently without ill effect. Several days later the rest of the matter
HAD NOT putrefied, although it had been left EXPOSED in the open air.

"Dr. W. A. Langsford, Northern Territory Director of Health in Darwin,
stated that microscopic examination revealed the material to be hair and
tissue. Samples were to be forwarded to forensic laboratories in Adelaide
for further tests. There is even a possibility, he said, that the matter is
HUMAN.

"Possibly romancing, Australians report that for many years overland
drovers have DISLIKED TAKING CATTLE ALONG THAT PART OF THE ROUTE because of
FREQUENT STAMPEDES."

One might wonder if the 'material' allegedly recovered from the well might
have been from a 'Sasquatch' like creature or an animal unknown to us. It
would seem logical for living matter, once dead, to remain 'relatively'
free from putrifecation for long periods of time within the cool and
unchanging environment of an underground cavern system as opposed to the
often hot, degenerating and debilitating environment on the surface. Could
a type of natural 'mummification' have also taken place underground,
possibly explaining why the hair and flesh had not putrefied after several
days?

According to William Hamilton, John Lear revealed an incident concerning an
older gentleman who is known only as Mr. 'K', whose son was being held
captive in an underground base in Utah. This son formerly worked in the
Dulce base in New Mexico and possibly was transferred to the base in Utah
via an underground route. When contacted about the incident, Mr. Lear had
this to say:

     "...The son, whose father I met and who passed away several years
     ago is apparently being held in a base near or around Sleeping
     Ute Mountain [Utah]. I don't remember how I came by that
     information but it had to do with some research I was conducting
     in a search for the Project Blue Light base near Delores (which I
     never found)."

Native 'Indians' of Alaska refer to a benevolent tribe who long ago
disappeared underground into vast underground chambers below the mountains
north of the town of Tanana. Occasionally, tradition holds, a young member
of one of the villages on the surface would become overly discouraged by
their life in the world above, and would make a journey in search of these
caverns and their peaceful inhabitants, and disappear into the underground
land where they would enjoy a more fulfilling life.

It would be very encouraging if most of the accounts of subsurface colonies
were of this genre. A few centuries ago this might have been the case, but
the infestation and under-mining of the continents by so-called "draconian"
forces and the mercenary "gray" species that work for them, has reportedly
increased dramatically -- especially during the last few centuries -- to
the point that their influence may be dominant in the subterranean world.
However it is encouraging that in the latter part of the 20th century the
reptilian advances seem to have halted in several areas of the world as
indicated by the numerous 'standoffs', and in some cases reptilian forces
have apparently been driven back and defeated as more and more humans
refuse to give up their ground, having become aware of their malicious
intent as well as the propaganda and deceptions which the aliens have in
the past used as effective tools of conquest on their part.

Some researchers have stated that there are some governments which are
considering possible overt military action against the serpent races (or
'Grays', 'EBE's', 'ALF's' etc., as they are also known) if such becomes
necessary. Covert military action has allegedly been initiated in the past,
with mixed results.

The alleged interception of a reptilian-controlled aerial craft in South
Africa could be considered a victory, whereas the 66 CIA-trained Delta
Force and Blue Beret special forces, casualties in the "Dulce Wars" (and
God only knows how many 'casualties' in the way of the human abductions and
mutilations, the knowledge of which allegedly attributed in part to the
'Wars') beneath the Archuleta mesa in New Mexico, could be considered a
defeat.

If or when such action is taken it would be very wise to consider the need
for what we may call an "occupational force". To illustrate, let's use the
Middle East crisis of the early 1990's as an example, without going into
whether the economic motives for the counter-offensive were commendable or
not.

In that case we had a small relatively undefended country by the name of
Kuwait. Having become apathetic to the Iraqui- Babylonian threat, this
small nation in essence let their guard down, "fell asleep" under the
influence of their wealthy, materialistic and extravagant lifestyle, and in
such a 'drunken' state lost their vigilance against any possible enemy who
might try to overtake them.

Taking advantage of the relatively undefended borders, Iraqui troops
swiftly moved in and took control of the nation, looting and pillaging, and
in some cases gang-raping woman and little girls in front of their
families, following which the entire family was often murdered.

Unable to defend themselves, they petitioned a much more powerful force,
the United States and the Allied Coalition to help them fight the battle.
The rest is history.

After the Allies drove modern 'Babylon' from Kuwait (Saddam Hussain made no
secret of the fact that he identified himself with the first Babylonian
king Nebuchadnezzar, and was in the process of rebuilding the ancient city
of Babylon), an "occupational force" was left by some of the Allies, as
well as the now much-more-vigilant Kuwaites.

After this enemy (not necessarily the Iraqui soldiers themselves, but the
mad dictator who drove them to their deaths by the thousands and whom many
of them secretly resented) was cast out, this "occupational force" was
necessary to defend the region from a possible re-invasion. If such an
occupational defense force once again became non-vigilant and let down it's
guard, then there is a chance that the former invaders would regroup their
forces and re-invade the land, possibly with even greater fury, not willing
to make the same mistake as before.

In the same manner, if an overt attack against the reptilian invaders is
undertaken, it would serve little purpose in the long run to destroy
multitudes of them physically and IGNORE the NEED for their human victims
(victims of subtle alien occult- technological mind manipulation) to be
delivered from their "Post-Traumatic Stress" and other psychological,
emotional and physical problems that were the direct result of alien
interference in their lives. The need for psychological and spiritual 'de-
programming' (as well as the safe removal of implants and sub- conscious
"programs" injected through hypnotic indoctrination) would be paramount!

Since the serpent races rely on demoniacal energy and assistance to empower
their activities, they seek to destroy man's connection or relationship
with Almighty God, the ONLY one powerful enough to protect and defend man
from this reptilian influence -- a force which would otherwise seek to
conquer and control all of creation using all of the deception, confusion,
subtlety and cunning at it's disposal.

God is not going to FORCE man to trust in Him, since we all have the free
choice to determine our own destinies (and in fact if God only created a
race who had no free will, but followed His every dictate robotically, then
the human 'soul' or 'personality' as we know it would not exist).

On the other hand, we MUST realize that man is like a living 'temple'
created to magnify his Creator. If there is no 'light' in the temple, then
darkness must reign within it, but where the light exists, darkness
vanishes.

There is no 'middle' ground. One cannot expect to defeat these 'dragons' of
deception nor the poltergeists or infernal supernatural entities that
motivate them, while at the same time refusing to abide in the LIFE or
LIGHT of God. If we were to destroy most of the reptilian influences and
temporarily cast them out of their trenches (so to speak) and at the same
time refuse to establish an "occupying force" in the form of divine
dominion in our own personal lives as a nation, then the reptilians may
regather their infernal forces and return in even greater force the next
time, intent on learning from the 'mistakes' of their last defeat.

Several 'abductees' have allegedly be taken during the night by GOVERNMENT
officials by way of anything from flying disks, pickups, or even jet
aircraft. One couple, referred to in a book titled 'INTO THE FRINGE', by
Karla Turner, Ph.D., (Berkley Books, N.Y. 1992) described such an abduction
which they shared one night. They were 'drugged' and put into a type of
dream-like trance and then taken via pickup to a remote swamp-like area.
The next thing they remembered was descending through some type of tube
only to find themselves walking through a musty underground cavern filled
with various machines similar to those one might find in a factory. They
were escorted into a room which resembled a 'saloon'. The husband later
felt as if this atmosphere may have been specifically designed to reinforce
the 'dreamy' quality of the experience. However, the husband began to come
out of the 'trance', at which point a man (like an Army Sergeant) noticed
him and became very upset and emotional. He began asking the husband
questions about his abductions by the Grays (the couple did recall such
abductions, which were shared with other people, some of whom they claimed
were in the underground military installation that same night). The
Military officer wanted to know what the Grays had told them, what their
plans were, and so on. When the husband refused to answer him the Officer
lost control and became very emotional, DEMANDING to be told what the grays
were doing, treating him more-or-less like a collaborator with an enemy
power rather than as a victim of an abduction.

If the (Constitutional) Government is going to such lengths to find out
what is going on, then they must not have all of the answers. Unfortunately
many abductees are seen as possible 'collaborators' by various segments of
the U.S. Military, and the fault for this probably lies with them as well
as with the abductees, being that the Constitutionals through their own
apathy had in the past allowed the secret government, particularly the CIA,
to drag them into the 'game'. The Air Force for instance must have been
deceived by the CIA as to the true nature of the Grays, and it has only
been in recent decades that they have come to realize the full truth, and
therefore explaining the present 'Intelligence War' between the two
Intelligence agencies -- Naval Intelligence's "COM-12" which supports a
counter-offensive against the Gray Empire and the pro-Gray CIA-NSA
"AQUARIUS" agency -- both of which are fighting for control of the Nevada
Military Complex, the underground bases, the Wackenhut tech- nologies, the
Intelligence Network (especially MJ-12), and the U.S. Government itself.

Hopefully in the future the 'elected' government and the abduction VICTIMS
will be able to put aside their paranoia of each other (no doubt fueled by
alien propaganda), and work together for each other's mutual benefit AS THEY
DID DURING THE GENESIS OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC. At this point it is
obvious that if they don't learn to work together and RESPECT each other
(the Government respecting the public's right to Constitutional Freedom and
the Public respecting the Constitutional government's duly elected
authority), little will be accomplished in the way of defending ourselves
from the alien vermin who infest and undermine the nations of our world.

First we must make a distinction between the Constitutionally ELECTED open
government and the National Socialist IMPOSED secret government. To put it
simply, the UNITED NATIONS who betrayed America during the Korean and
Vietnam wars is the ENEMY WITHIN that must be thrown out of America. If
they desire a world dictatorship (for that is exactly what they are
promoting, in spite of the 'benevolent world government' tripe that they
have been spouting for years), then they can go do it some- where else. As
for the United States of America, we have our own historical document upon
which this great nation was founded -- The "DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE"!

The following account was revealed by writer and UFO investigator Preston
Dennet, in an article titled: 'EXPOSED: PROJECT REDLIGHT'. In his article,
which originally reached several thousand readers, he reveals the following
information which supports the allegations of William Cooper, John Lear,
Michael Lindemann and several others:

"...Tom's story began in high school. He was very bright and had received
an exceptionally high score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. In fact, his
scores were so high, it caused some attention to be paid to him. It seemed
that the United States Government was very interested in Tom and wanted him
to work for them. He had no idea then what his high scores were going to
cost him.

"Government officials first approached Tom's parents, and asked them if
they would allow their son to work for the government. When Tom's parents
gave their consent, Tom was approached and given an offer he couldn't
refuse. In exchange for his services, he would receive a Top Secret
security clearance to match a ridiculously large salary. His job was to
conduct research in a Top Secret underground base in Alaska.

"Tom accepted the offer and went directly out of high school and into
government service. He told everyone that he was stationed at a base in
Nevada -- but this was only a cover story. In reality Tom spent only the
weekends in Nevada. On weekdays he flew by private military jet to a Top
Secret Government base in Alaska.

"The base was an eight story building located almost totally underground.
The base financed itself by setting up the world's leading drug smugglers.
Officials would arrest the drug smugglers, confiscate all the money and
drugs, and then turn around and sell the drugs to another smuggler -- whom
they would then proceed to arrest and confiscate. It sounds like a strange
way to finance a scientific-military research base, but it is obviously
very profitable. Although not strictly legal, such practices could be
justified in the name of National Security (at least in some minds).

"Tom reported that the base was mainly a research station that nabbed up
some of the best scientific minds in the country, and had the latest
technology for advanced research. There were three major areas of research
of which he was aware.

"Firstly, the base researched and developed biological weapons, which, as
Tom said, made all other weapons seem like childsplay.

"Secondly, the base researched and developed electronic sensory and
detection devices that allowed telescopic sight through solid objects, such
as walls.

"Thirdly -- and most importantly -- the base researched and developed
electromagnetic propulsion devices -- flying crafts which needed no fuel
other than the Earth's magnetic field on which to operate. According to
Tom, the ships look like UFOs, and are able to hover silently, and move at
astonishing speeds. As Tom says in his own words, 'Some of the UFOs seen
over Alaska are probably ours.'

"Tom didn't say exactly what his job at the base entailed, but he did say
that the security was extremely high. Every week he was subjected to a
horrible ritual. Due to the nature of his job, everything about him had to
be known. He would be taken to a special room where he was dosed with
Sodium Pentothal and put into a hypnotic trance. For a period of a couple
hours, he would be interrogated into every aspect of his life for the past
week. Every detail would be laid bare to make sure that there were no
security leaks. This agonizing ritual was repeated every week as long as he
was at the base. There were no exceptions.

"Tom evidently got out of the business after several years as the lifestyle
was too harsh. Since he left the base he has been, and still is, under
close monitoring by the government. After his release from the base, he was
offered several extremely high-paying jobs by some of the country's leading
corporations. Tom declined these offers and pursued a more modest job and
lifestyle.

"So closes Tom's story, which alone could be easily dismissed. But in
league with those collected by other researchers, it seems evident that the
government is in possession of UFOs, and are in fact, flying them around!"

The following article comes from the 'TC TECHNICAL CONSULTANT', Nov.-Dec.,
1991 issue:

"The death of a journalist in West Virginia, plus the jailing of an alleged
CIA computer consultant in Washington State may be elements of a much wider
scandal that could have serious implications for the Bush White House in
1992.

"What started out as an investigation of an apparent case of pirated
software has grown to be a project involving hundreds of journalists all
over the world.

"The dead journalist, Joseph Daniel 'Danny' Casolaro was found dead August
10th in a motel room in West Virginia. His wrists were slashed seven times
on each wrist and a suicide note was found nearby. The only manuscript of
his book, with accompanying notes, WAS MISSING.

"The book, provisionally titled 'The Octopus', was meant to be an explosive
expose of misdeeds by the Justice Department under the Reagan
administration. Time Magazine also reported that Casolaro's research
centered on gambling and attempted arms deals at the Cabazon reservation
near Indio (California - Branton).

"Indeed, the scope of Casolaro's investigation was so large that any one of
a large number of areas of research could have been the trigger for a
possible hit.

"While authorities declared his death a suicide, his relatives definitely
stated that Casolaro's mental state was sound, indeed upbeat, after the
completion of his book.

"Casolaro started his work nearly two years before, investigating the
bankrupting of a small computer software company called Inslaw, allegedly
by the U.S. Justice Department. INSLAW, a company headed by Bill and Nancy
Hamilton of Washington D.C., had developed a package known as PROMIS --
short for Prosecutor's Management Information System -- to act as a case
management tool for the Justice Department's unwieldy work load.

"Inslaw President Bill Hamilton (NOT to be mistaken for the well-known UFO
researcher - Branton) has claimed that Ed Meese associate EARL BRIAN was
given control of pirated versions of the PROMIS software by Meese to sell
back to different U.S. government agencies for great profit. Two courts
have so far agreed with Hamilton, awarding an 8 million dollar judgment,
but a higher court of appeal has quashed the award and the verdict,
declaring that it was not the jurisdiction of the lower courts. As of
October 9, the case has moved into the realm of the Supreme Court.

"EARL BRIAN OWNS UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL (UPI) and FINANCIAL NEWS
NETWORK (FNN).

     "According to a Washington man, who claims to have modified the
     cobol-based software for the CIA and other intelligence agencies,
     the software was a reward for Earl Brian's role in arranging the
     so-called 'October Surprise' gambit, the alleged conspiracy to
     withhold the American hostages in Iran until after the 1980
     election which saw Carter removed from power. The 'October
     Surprise' scandal has taken some time to emerge.

     "In a Paris meeting, President Bush (at the time Ronald Reagan's
     Vice Presidential running mate - Branton) is alleged to have met
     with Ali Akabar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Iranian
     Parliament, Mohammed Ali Rajai, the future President of Iran and
     Manucher Ghorbanifar, an Iranian arms dealer with connections to
     Mossad, according to Navy Captain Gunther Russbacher who claims
     to have flown Bush, William Casey -- the CIA chief -- and Donald
     Gregg, a CIA operative to that location. Russbacher, who made
     these allegations in May is now in jail on Terminal Island,
     convicted on the charge of impersonating a U.S. Attorney.

     "The Washington man is MICHAEL RICONOSCIUTO who is now waiting
     for a trial in a Washington jail on conspiracy to sell drugs
     charges, charges which Riconosciuto claims are manufactured.
     Indeed, the charge made against Riconosciuto were made one week
     after Riconosciuto authored and signed an affidavit describing
     his role in modifying the pirated software.

     "The affidavit also claimed that he had been contacted by phone
     and threatened by PETER VIDENIEKS, a Justice Department employee
     and Customs official, who Riconosciuto alleged had intelligence
     ties, as to the possible consequences of his going public with
     certain information.

     "According to Riconosciuto, Videnieks was a frequent visitor to
     the Cabazon Indian reservation near Palm Springs and visited with
     tribal manager, John P. Nichols. Nichols was in essence
     Riconosciuto's boss in a number of enterprises conducted on
     reservation land and the PROMIS modification was just one of
     these projects. According to Riconosciuto, in an interview with
     T.C. conducted from jail, the PROMIS software was modified to
     install a backdoor access for use by American intelligence
     services. The software was then sold to 88 different countries as
     a sort of 'trojan horse' package enabling us to access their
     intelligence systems. According to Riconosciuto these countries
     included Iraq and Libya.

     "Correspondence between Nichols and other companies, if
     authentic, indicates that Riconosciuto's claims of his expertise
     in the area of electronics and armaments appear to be true.
     Marshall Riconosciuto, Michael's father, is a reputed former
     business partner of Richard Nixon.

     "According to Riconosciuto, the fuzzy status of reservation land
     as 'sovereign' allowed elements of the CIA and organized crime to
     conduct business uniquely.

     "Among the projects worked on during this time were joint
     projects with WACKENHUT, a company loaded with former CIA and NSA
     personnel and business ventures with the Saudi Arabian royal
     family and other unusual projects.

     "A joint venture with Southern California Edison will soon be
     generating power for bio-mass drawn from local waste outlets.
     Biological warfare projects were investigated with Stormont
     laboratories looking into the creation of 'pathogenic viruses'
     and enhanced fuel-air explosive weapons (which) were created and
     tested in league with Meridian Arms at the NEVADA TESTING RANGE
     which matched the explosive power of nuclear devices.

     "These enhanced weapons gained their power from polarizing the
     molecules in the gas cloud by modification of the electric field,
     a technology developed from exploring Thomas Townsend Brown's
     suppressed work, a knowledge which Riconosciuto claims he gained
     from working at LEAR in Reno, Nevada.

     "Riconosciuto is said to have worked on the enhanced fuel- air
     explosive weapons with Gerald Bull of Space Research Corporation.
     Bull, now deceased, later became an arms advisor to Saddam
     Hussein. It is said that HUSSEIN POSSESSES THE FAE TECHNOLOGY.

     "In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times of London
     was shot and killed in Guatemala. He had reportedly been trying
     to interview an American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time
     director of security for the Cabazon Indian Reservation secret
     projects.

     "In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was found
     dead, killed by a single bullet in his chest. According to a
     former federal official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was
     found dead in the parking lot where he had been due to meet with
     a woman who had crucial evidence to share substantiating
     Riconosciuto's claims.

     a formal inquiry will be initiated into the Inslaw case. Foley
     appointed Senator Terry Sanford as co-chairman of the joint

     the attorney representing Earl Brian in his 1985 takeover bid for
     United Press International and was instrumental in appointing
     Earl Brian, a medical doctor, to the board of Duke Medical
     School, of which Sanford is President.

     "However, despite repeated requests from journalists to produce
     photographs showing Riconosciuto together with Brian, and
     requests to produce his passport showing his alleged trip to

     to describe Peter Videnieks to CNN's Moneyline program, claiming
     a medical condition prevented him from remembering clearly.

     Riconosciuto's credibility. Gunderson, who lives in Manhattan

     capacity as private investigator.

     "Together, according to Gunderson, they were responsible for
     thwarting a terrorist operation during the Los Angeles Olympics.
     According to Gunderson, Riconosciuto was well known in certain
     circles as a genius in almost all sciences.

     "The so-called drug operation broken up in Washington State was
     an electrohydrodynamic mining operation claimed Gunderson, using
     Townsend Brown technology. A videotape viewed by this journalist
     revealed metallic powders and apparent processes unrelated to
     drug manufacture. Indeed, a government analysis of soil samples
     revealed the absence of drug contamination, but a high
     concentration of barium. Barium is often found in high voltage

In the same publication, same issue, there appeared a small article just
following the one quoted above. Written by Thomas Zed, the article, titled
"WACKENHUT'S CONNECTION WITH THE BLACK PROJECT WORLD", stated:

     "The Wackenhut company has a very close connection to the world
     of BLACK BUDGET PROJECTS. Besides being connected with the
     Cabazon venture mentioned in this issue it is also responsible,
     according to jailed computer consultant Michael Riconosciuto, FOR
     THE SECRET PROJECTS BEING UNDERTAKEN IN DULCE, NEW MEXICO where
     the JICARILLA INDIAN RESERVATION IS BEING SIMILARLY USED. (Note:

'Commander X', the 'anonymous' Intelligence-Military insider who has
apparently fulfilled his Constitutional oath by providing so much 'inside'
information on aerial and subsurface 'alien' activity -- information which
in fact coincides with other accounts given by numerous other researchers
-- made the following comments (Note: The 'Commander' admits to being a
member of a high-level Intelligence network -- intent on exposing the
Illuminati 'cancer' in the Intelligence Community -- called 'THE COMMITTEE
OF 12 TO SAVE THE EARTH'. It is not certain however whether or not this has
any connection to the notorious 'COM-12'):

"...Robert Dickhoff, in his book 'AGHARTA', mentions that the secret
chambers of the Pyramid of Gizeh were connected by tunnels to the
Subterranean World. An Egyptian informant says that at the base of this
pyramid are three tunnels that radiate in different directions. Two lead to
dead ends, but the third seems to go on and on and may have once connected
Atlantis with it's colony in Egypt by passing under the Mediterranean and
Atlantic. (There are those who have suggested that some of the ancient
structures near Cairo, Egypt are in fact of antediluvian origin - Branton)

"...Two Swedes tried to traverse this long tunnel till it's end and never
returned. While believed to have died, rescue parties could not find them.
This caused the government to FORBID anyone from entering this third long
tunnel, though they were permitted to enter the other two. There are
strange reports of ANCIENT EGYPTIANS (or rather, people appearing or
looking like ancient Egyptians - Branton) having been seen inside the long
tunnel, coming from the Subterranean World. Many believe that the Swedes
who disappeared joined these people. A popular book was selling in Egypt
some time ago entitled 'THE MYSTERIOUS PATH TO THE UNKNOWN WORLD', dealing
with the apparently endless third tunnel below the pyramid of Gizeh and the
world to which it leads...

"A report has been circulating that some scientists entered a tunnel in
West Africa that ran under the ocean bed in the direction of the vanished
Atlantis, which was finally reached and many mechanical contrivances were
seen (through some type of 'window' looking out into the depths? - Branton)
on the ocean bed, including motor vehicles. How true this reporter is, the
writer cannot say."

The following information was sent to researcher B. Alan Walton from
Juliette Sweet, a personal friend of Sharula Dux (also known as Bonnie
Condey), the self-professed resident of Telos, the city below Mt. Shasta,
and was dated 2/7/93:

     "...last month I had your disk transcribed and read your
     materials in their entirety. Very interesting, and full of well
     cited facts. I appreciate your sense of groundedness when
     presenting your ideas... I am not familiar with the saurian race,
     nor have I heard mention of them from Sharula or Adama (an
     alleged spiritual leader in Telos - Branton)... The Greys do come
     up from time to time, and what has been communicated by the
     Hierarchy is that they are indeed being asked, forcibly if
     necessary, to leave. The ousting process has been active for the
     last year or so, and Adama has indicated that Los Alamos will be
     one of the last areas to clear out... there has been some 'star
     wars' type of conflict of late, but (they) tell us not to worry
     about it [and] that they have things well in hand... Sharula's
     age is actually 267 years. Although for surface ID purposes, she
     says she was born in 1951. It helps where social security and
     passport purposes are concerned. You might want to update your
     materials to reflect her actual age..." (Note: of course the
     "ousting process" would necessitate a cessation of ILLUMINATI
     interaction with the Grays, as the 'Baverians' have in the past
     allowed the Grays' access to this planet and even harbored them
     and protected them and their bases from public or foreign
     intrusion - Branton)

One report that came out of the Nevada Military Complex has not been
confirmed and it's exact source is uncertain. The report was based on
information provided by a man who was involved in high-security work in the
underground bases below the Nevada Military Complex. This man stated that
while working at the facilities there he learned of a race of 'aliens'
which were also resident in parts of the underground bases, a group known
as the 'Orange'. The 'Orange' are apparently a hybrid-type of alien of
humanoid form and possess some 'reptilian' genetic character- istics yet
with human-like reproductive organs and capable of breeding with human
beings. It is also interesting that other sources apply to them a partial
cybernetic quality, suggesting that they are in fact a branch of humans who
have been genetic- ally infused with reptilian DNA and also electronically
or bionically altered with cybernetics. Whether or not some or all of the
"ORANGE" possess a human "soul-matrix" is something which has not yet been
established, at least by 'the Group'.

Since, as we've indicated earlier, evidence suggests that no TRUE 'hybrid'
can exist between the sauroid and human races, because humans have an
energy-soul matrix whereas true serpent race or reptilian entities do not
(among many other dissimilar characteristics), we must assume that the
entities encountered by the Nevada base worker were what one 'might' refer
to as "Drac-Orange" (no soul-energy matrix) or "Eva-Orange" (soul-energy
matrix). Please bear with us in our attempts to 'create' titles wherein none
is perceived by us to exist, to describe the various new concepts which
often turn up in this type of "fringe" research. Here we are simply
applying the traditional names of the first recorded reptilian male (Draco)
which 'tradition- ally' was the father of the serpent races; and the first
recorded human female (Eva) who was 'traditionally' the mother of all the
human races, as recorded in Genesis chapter 3, which also records the
hatred and enmity that would exist between the two 'races' down through the
ages. As for the "Orange", just which of the two categories these entities
fall under (Dracorange or Evaorange or both), as we have indicated
previously, remains uncertain at the time of this writing.

Another account, also unconfirmed, refers to an individual (possibly
involved with military intelligence) who was reportedly invited to work
with a group of 'Aryans' who were resident at a secret base in or near the
Nevada Military complex, along with Secret Government Military personnel.
This individual claimed that this group had access to UFO type craft and
utilized the symbol of the Swastika, and were presently in conflict with
the Greys, which they might have at one time in the past had associations
with. As in the case of nearly every human organization that has
established interactions with the sauroid Grey aliens, perhaps these
particular 'Aryans' also learned of the true nature of the reptilian races
after being 'betrayed' by them. There are some "Aryans" that may have
broken-off from the Antarctican Empire, which we must assume (until
evidence to the contrary presents itself) is still in collaboration with
the Reptilian and Gray Empires, and still holds to Hitler's Nazi-nightmare
of a fascist electronic NEW WORLD ORDER, complete -- according to some --
with human 'slaves' bearing mind-control implants inserted during
abductions by joint Nazi-Reticulan saucer crews such at the one encountered
by Betty and Barney Hill. It is interesting however that both the CIA as
well as the 'Aryans' are said to be operating in and below the Nevada Test
site, which might support allegations by some that the CIA struck a deal
with the Nazi's sometime before or after World War II, and that both groups
have had past and present ties with the International Baverian (German)
Illuminati.

If such an off-shoot group of "Aryans" or ex-Nazis does exist it might be
wise for them, considering the Nazi atrocities of the past, to RENOUNCE the
swastika and all that it stands for if they intend to recieve any help or
support whatsoever from true Americans in their conflict with the grays. We
must be careful not to equate "Germans" with "Nazis" and thus fall into the
same racist trap into which the Nazis themselves fell. Nazism is a
PHILOSOPHICAL problem, not a RACIAL one, and in fact there have been many
Germans who have contributed to the overall benefit of humanity, including
Luther and Gutenberg and others who challenged the despotes of Rome (that
is, until later generations of Germans sold themselves out once again to
the so- called 'holy' Roman EMPIRE via the Jesuits who absolutely infested
Hitler's S.S. according to Edmund Paris. This infiltration of Hitler's
ranks by the Roman "militia" was accomplished in order to carry out the NEW
INQUISITION against the Jews, the latest in a long history of ROMAN
persecutions against the Israelite race).

Even if present Aryan 'generations' were not PERSONALLY responsible for the
war crimes of their fathers during WWII, they would still have to agree to
conform to Constitutional principles of HUMAN EQUALITY regardless of race,
religion or culture if they are to have any future peaceful coexistence
with the most power- ful nation on the 'face' of the earth, the United
States of America. Otherwise they might find themselves in the very
uncomfortable position of being wedged between two enemy fronts: the
saurian greys on one side AND indignant anti-Nazi American patriots, many
of whom lost family members to the Nazi's during the Second World War, on
the other. If an 'inner-planetary' or inter- planetary war does erupt
between human and saurian species, as some have suggest might overtly take
place in the future, then the neo-Nazi saucer groups (supposing they exist)
MUST decide to join up with the human race and cast off their former
FASCIST ideologies OR ELSE try and appease the alien Grays -- most likely
to their own ultimate destruction -- or become caught up in the
'cross-fire' between the human and serpent races in whatever future
conflicts might be waged between the two.

There are possible indications that 'at least' THREE groups of entirely
human 'aliens' have some connection with the Nevada Military Complex,
possibly involving humanoid aliens retrieved alive from crashed
saucer-disks, or human-aliens who are willingly assisting certain
governmental compartments in the technology department. For instance the
above account suggests that some so-called ARYANS with past or present
affiliation with the Antarctican Empire have some possible connection
there; as well as the Pleiadean NORDICS as suggested by Robert Lazar's
claim that a Pleiadean 'beamship' was seen by him on certain occasions in
the hangers; and then there are the tall Telosian BLONDS who have also been
known to have some connection with the underground networks of Nevada and
the South-West. In fact, there may be several different 'scenarios' taking
place at once within the Test Site, as if no individual 'compartment' has
full control of what is taking place there (this has been suggested by
different sources).

In one sense the 'Test Site' is the center of a WORLD WAR III type of
scenario, the only difference is that it is a covert or 'underground' war
since neither the Reptilians nor the Illuminati want this conflict to be
made public, although some of the 'Constitutionals' have apparently
'leaked' information through the COM-12 and similar intelligence
organizations. The allegations, as given by intelligence sources like
'Yellow Fruit', indicate that some of the 'benevolents' are operating in
and below Nevada -- 'aliens' who honor a Constitutional form of Government
in the U.S. This would also indicate that there is more than one group of
human-like 'aliens' active there, and that there are in fact THREE general
groups fighting for control, the Nordic-human FEDERATION, the 'Joint'
Illuminati/Gray COMBINE, and the Reptilian EMPIRE itself. Some however
would suggest that the 'Joint' activity groups are not a third power group
at all but rather a 'midpoint' organization of power-hungry humans and
grays that are working together on a competitive basis in an interactive
and sometimes all-too-real and deadly bid for world domination. Both the
Illuminati and the Grays want the planet to come under central control and
both sides need each other's assistance to bring it to pass, but they
disagree just who will be the ultimate masters, the Humans or the Grays.
Basically it is a rather sickening love- hate relationship, or a guarded
"marriage of convenience".

Ancient Hebrew history speaks of a race of human beings known as the
'Anakim' in whose sight the ancient Israelites saw themselves as
'grasshoppers'. These giants were apparently very human yet of enormous
stature. According to some accounts they were anywhere from 9 to 12 feet
tall, and remained until the Israelites eventually drove them out of
Palestine. As to their final destination or what became of them, the Hebrew
records are strangely silent.

There are some who believe that men of such stature may have existed
previous to the deluge and the cataclysms which accompanied it, however the
Hebrew records make it clear that a human race of such great stature
existed in post-deluvian times as well.

Researcher Warren Smith paraphrased, in 1976, two accounts related by
Leland Lovelace describing incredible finds. The following discoveries are
very similar to an account which appeared in an early issue of TAL LeVesque
and Mary Martin's 'HOLLOW HASSLE' newsletter, one which described a similar
cave found in the Silver Peak range of southwestern Nevada, not far from
the Mojave Desert (and in which the bones of human giants, along with
gigantic stone furniture and golden artifacts, etc., was reportedly
discovered). The woman who submitted the account claimed to have personally
known an explorer who had been in the tunnels. The cave was supposedly
discovered with the help of a 'MU-rian' treasure map which was said to have
originated from an Native American tribe in the area. Warren Smith
describes two similar incidents, one of which 'may' be a confirmation of
the cavern discovered in the Silver Peak Range, in the following words:

     "...Author Leland Lovelace told about such a discovery in 'LOST
     MINES AND BURIED TREASURES' (Naylor Co., 1965; also Ace Books,
     New York). Lovelace said two prospectors were searching for a
     gold strike in the desolate mountains of south- western Nevada.
     The two men were digging in the arid soil when a cave-in led them
     into a vast underground tunnel. Following the passageway, they
     went deep into the mountain and entered a large subterranean
     room.

     "The two astonished prospectors held their torches high and saw
     that the cave was furnished with chairs and tables. The furniture
     was very large, as if manufactured for a race of giants. Dishes
     cast from gold and silver were also found on the tables. Other
     artifacts made from precious metals were discovered in the
     cavern.

     "Lovelace did not inform his readers as to what the prospectors
     did with their discovery. We can assume they carried as much of
     the precious metal as possible from the scene, then melted down
     the objects for their gold and silver. This often occurs when a
     gold-seeker finds a rare archeological discovery. Rather than
     risk the treasure being taken over by the state or federal
     govern- ment, these men play a game of 'finder's keepers.'

     "In 1904, a prospector named J.C. Brown claimed to have made an
     intriguing discovery in the Cascade mountain range of California.
     Brown had been hired by the Lord Cowdray Mining Company of
     England to prospect for gold in these isolated areas. During his
     second trip into the Cascades, Brown found a manmade tunnel
     carved into a solid rock wall. According to old reports, a
     landslide had destroyed a rock wall that hid the tunnel entrance.

     "Brown followed the enormous tunnel through the mountain and came
     to a large, manmade cavern. The room was lined with sheets of
     tempered copper. Strange circular shields hammered from gold were
     hung on the walls. Unusual artifacts and statues were located in
     niches in the cavern walls. Unusual drawings, strange art,
     indecipherable hieroglyphics AND THE SKELETONS OF WHAT WAS
     APPARENTLY A GIANT RACE WERE FOUND IN ROOMS LEADING OFF FROM THE
     LARGE CAVERN.

     "Unwilling to share his discovery with his English employers,
     Brown did not report the treasure cavern. Instead, he continued
     to work for various mining companies for the next thirty years
     until his retirement. Then, in 1934, he popped up in Stockton,
     California, with a map and an intriguing tale. Within a few days,
     eighty people were willing to assist the now-aging prospector in
     getting the precious artifacts out of the cave.

     "On June 19, 1934, Brown and his followers traveled into the
     Cascade mountains. They camped by a small stream, waiting until
     morning when Brown was to show the group an entrance into the
     cavern. However, during the night, the old prospector vanished.
     He has not been seen since that night.

     "Fearing that Brown had somehow duped the eighty people,
     detectives on the Stockton police department investigated. 'Brown
     didn't take a cent from anyone,' the detectives said after the
     check-out.

     "The police chief asked, 'What was his game?'

     "The detectives shrugged.

     "'Was he murdered out there?' asked the chief.

     "'He was probably an old liar who knew his time was up,' replied
     one of the detectives.

     "'Brown was a kindly old gentleman of advanced years when he
     arrived in Stockton,' a doctor wrote several years ago. 'I was a
     curious young man at the time, always interested in occult lore.
     Anything that smelled of adventure grabbed my interest. Brown's
     stories were fascinating. They may have been tall stories about
     mythical things by an old man looking for companionship. Somehow,
     over the years, I've gained new respect for the old man. I
     believe he was telling the truth. I don't know his reasons, but I
     think he changed his mind at the last minute and decided not to
     reveal the location of the lost treasure vault of the 'Lemurian'
     giants.'"

In his book, 'THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE EARTH' (Doubleday & Co., Inc., Garden
City, N.Y. 1974. pp. 135-136), Michael Grumley relates an ancient Hebrew
tradition which suggests that remnants of a race of 'giants', possibly
'hairy' giants, survived the ancient deluge along with Noah and a menagerie
of other animals:

"...in the Genesis story, there is an incident absent in the King James
version but present in various scattered references in the Hebrew Midrash
which concerns a giant named 'Og' who is said to have ridden on the ark
during the forty days and forty nights of the downpour that caused Noah's
flood. In order to be included in the ships company, so the story goes, it
was agreed that he would, once the ark reached dry land and the waters
receded, became a servant of Noah and ALL OF his descendants. He (and
presumably a female of his kind were) the only one[s] of what was a
widespread race of giants who perished, along with all men (except) Noah
and his three sons Shem, Ham and Japeth (this also, Hebrew tradition holds,
included the four women who were the wives of Noah and his three sons,
making eight in all. Or, if the "OG" account is accurate, was it TEN
"people" -- eight humans and two half-humans? - Branton)."

As for the Sasquatch itself (or Yeti, Bigfoot or Abominable Snowman, etc.),
in most cases they are described as being peaceable except when provoked,
although such cases of retributional violence against humans are rare.

It is usually said that the Sasquatch resemble not so much a "missing link"
between humans and apes, but more of a "hybrid" between the two, such as "a
human head on an apes body" in the words of one witness. This might suggest
that humans and apes are two distinct species, and that in some ancient
time the genetic similarity might have resulted in hybrid offspring between
the two groups, consigning the Sasquatch offspring themselves to a horrible
and lonely existence, being outcast by men and beasts alike, being that
they were neither fully human nor fully animal. If such was the case in the
past, the genetic divergence's between the two groups may have long ago
strayed to the point that such a 'natural hybrid' would be impossible
today, except in the case of the DESCENDANTS of the Sasquatch race itself.

In the book "CHARLES BERLIT'Z WORLD OF THE ODD & AWESOME", we read of the
strange being that was discovered in the Congo several years ago. "He" was
given the nickname Oliver, however it was uncertain whether or not he was a
mutant, a hybrid, or part of a new species of chimp. He looked like a bald
chimpanzee, but his nose protruded much like that of a humans and UNLIKE
APES, who prefer to walk on their knuckles, Oliver seemed to naturally walk
upright. Was "Oliver" a Sasquatch, or of a race akin to the legendary hairy
humanoid?

Studied by Ralph Helfer of Burbank, California, it was dis- covered that
Oliver had FORTY-SEVEN CHROMOSOMES, FALLING BETWEEN AN APES FORTY-EIGHT AND
A HUMANS FORTY-SIX, suggesting a CROSSBREED. Oliver was extremely
intelligent for an "ape", and enjoyed watching television Westerns and
action programs for hours, unlike chimps, which became bored after a few
minutes.

Aside from the hairy humanoids, there have also allegedly been sightings of
satyrus-like creatures in connection with the underground or aerial
phenomena, although these sightings are relatively rare. They are described
as being small, goat-footed humanoids with horns. Because of the
paraphysical phenomena surrounding such sightings however, some have
suggested that they might be part of a quasi-physical pre-Adamic race which
were part of the original 'fall' described in Judeo-Christian theology, a
race that possessed humanoid, bestial AND angelic features and therefore
immortal. Whether their humanoid/animalistic attributes allowed them to
procreate is uncertain, however there are a few bizarre accounts which
surface from time to time of female witches or satan-worshippers having
been impregnated by satyrus-like incubi, following which they give birth to
a horrifying hybrid -- a frightening and often vicious humanoid child with
horns and tail, who traditionally live only a few days or weeks before
dying. This may be just a myth that has been created by occultists over the
years, as no actual cadavers of these supposed hybrids has ever turned up
in public.

Several years ago Brad Steiger reported an incredible incident involving a
demolition crew in San Francisco, who were in the process of tearing down
some old buildings when they broke into an underground cavity adjacent to
the basement level of one of the old structures. They gather together some
equipment and entered the opening, and were surprised to find themselves in
a tunnel which branched out in different directions underground. The
construction workers commenced to explore the passages for some distance
before they encountered something which left them shocked and trembling.
Right in front of them stood a group of the strangest creatures they had
ever seen. They were neither 'entirely' human nor entirely like any animal
they had seen before. They were humanoid, covered from head to foot with
hair, were around 5 feet tall, with eyes which reflected reddish in the
light of their flashbeams.

The demolitionists decided that they weren't going to stay there much
longer, and beat a hasty retreat back to the surface. The opening might
have been subsequently covered-up by debris and further demolition work,
although this is uncertain. Whatever may have become of the tunnel entrance
is anyone's guess.

Charles Berlitz, in his 'ATLANTIS - THE EIGHTH CONTINENT' (G. P. Putnams
Sons., New York., 1984., pp. 196-198), makes the following comments
concerning the ancient fallen society which was apparently one of the first
'civilizations' following the deluge to release the scourge of high-tech
thermonuclear warfare on the earth. He states:

     "...These periodic destruction's have occurred because Earth's
     inhabitants failed to carry out the plan of the Creator...
     According to the retelling of the Hopi legends by Frank Waters,
     in collaboration with White Bear (BOOK OF THE HOPI: 1968), when
     (the ancient peoples) had acquired what they wanted 'they wanted
     more still and wars began again.' The peoples of the Earth
     created 'big cities, nations, civilizations,' and invented
     aircraft -- PATUWVOTAS -- which they used to attack and destroy
     one another's cities. The warfare in this previous world ceased
     only when continents sank and the land and sea changed places,
     leaving the 'third world' (the one before the present) lying on
     the sea bottom, 'with all the proud cities, the flying
     PATUWVOTAS, and the worldly treasures corrupted with evil.'
     (Although the 'sinking of continents' seems to be a phenomena
     intimately connected with the deluge, this does not mean that
     other island continents might not have sunk within the centuries
     or millenia FOLLOWING deluge as well - Branton).

     "...It is in the books of ancient India, however, that we find
     allusions to prehistoric warfare that eerily parallel those of
     today as well as those of the foreseeable future (vide C.
     Berlitz: MYSTERIES FROM FORGOTTEN WORLDS). There are two possible
     explanations for them: either some scientifically minded Indians
     of six [or so] thousand years ago let their fancies roam at will
     and imagined bombs of sufficient force to destroy most of the
     world, or perhaps the whole concept was inherited from...a stage
     of development propitious to experimenting with or using the
     destructive power of the atom.

     "In any case, passages from traditional Indian literature, such
     as the VEDAS, the PURANAS, the RAMAYANA, the MAHAVIRA, and
     especially the MAHABHARATA, contain repeated references expressed
     in the poetic language of their era to aircraft -- VIMANAS --
     rockets, and space travel, but also specific allusions to what is
     easily recognizable as combat aircraft, air bombing, radar and
     other forms of aircraft detection, artillery, rocket launching,
     explosive bullets, detonation of mines, and bombs of cosmic
     destruction comparable in effect to the atom bomb of the present
     world. In other sections of Indian scientific and philosophical
     literature there are mentions attesting to the awareness of
     molecules and atoms of different elements, a concept that might
     eventually lead to the use of the power of the atom in warfare,
     just as it has in our day within a relatively short period of
     time. From the time that the atomic theory was generally accepted
     by modern scientists to the construction of the atom bomb WAS
     ONLY 130 TO 135 YEARS, while a previous world civilization, whose
     time span is unknown, would presumably have had as much or more
     time for such development.

     "...When the MAHABHARATA was to be translated in the last half of
     the 19th century into modern languages (into English by Protap
     Chandra Roy and into German by Max Muller), the fanciful
     descriptions of ancient warfare were generally ignored, except in
     the case of artillery - familiar to everyone - and aircraft, then
     considered to be lighter than air. V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar in
     his book on early Indian warfare (WAR IN ANCIENT INDIA: 1944),
     comments on the DECLINE of artillery in medieval times, inferring
     that it was more destructive in the distant past. He also defends
     the detailed references to heavier-than-air aircraft in ancient
     land and naval warfare, referring to 'the vast literature of the
     PURANAS showing how well and wonderfully the ancient Indians
     conquered the air.' Since Dikshitar was writing during the period
     of World War I he, like a number of Indian officers and British
     officers in the Indian service, was aware than many of the
     'imaginary' weapons of Indian antiquity had made an appearance
     (or reappearance) in both world wars. Dikshitar wrote, during
     World War I, that the MOHANASTRA or 'arrow of unconsciousness'
     was generally considered 'a creature of legend until we heard the
     other day of the bombs discharging poisonous gases.'"

In reference to an ancient weapon known as 'the iron thunderbolt', Berlitz
states: "According to the description in the MAHABHARATA its burst was as
bright as the flare of ten thousand suns. The cloud of smoke rising after
its first explosion formed into expanding round circles like the opening of
giant parasols.

"...A strangely modern injunction in the ATHARUA VEDA cautioned opposing
forces that the use of such a weapon was permissible only when the enemy
'used it first,'... There is even a mention in the MAUSALA PARVA implying
that on one occasion this weapon 'capable of reducing the Earth to ashes'
had been destroyed and the resultant powder had been 'cast into the sea,'
another timely suggestion from the distant past of Earth.

"Whether this legendary weapon was ever used, or was destroyed, or
forgotten except in Indian literature, there exists certain burned sections
of our planet that may be the result of meteor strikes or even the scars of
thermonuclear warfare, one of these was found in Iraq in 1947 in the course
of an archaeological probe dug vertically while penetrating a number of
cultural levels containing recognizable artifacts of BABYLON and SUMERIA
and eventually passed through a fourteen-foot level of clay, indicating
deposits following a severe and prolonged flood. Past the flood level a
stratum was eventually reached that proved to be fused glass -- almost
exactly similar to the desert floor at Alamogordo, New Mexico, scarred and
fused after the 'first' A-bomb test." (Gen. 4:22 states that only 7
generations after Adam, 'Tubal-cain' introduced complex metalwork, and no
doubt weaponry, to the antediluvians)

Some researchers and 'contactees' have referred to a 'human' group of
'aliens' from a nearby star system who are known as the 'Coldasians'. These
may very well be the same group who others refer to as the 'Koldasians'.
UFO PHOTO ARCHIVES (P. O. Box 17206., Tucson, AZ 85710) has released a
volume detailing an alleged contact with a person from the planet 'Koldas'.
It is uncertain as of this writing whether or not the 'Koldasians' (or
Coldasians) are part of the alleged, although loosely-tied,
Vega-Ummo-Pleiades-Andromeda-Cetus-Eridanus-Centaurus 'federation', all
allegedly inhabited by 'human' space-faring cultures. The Koldasians do
however claim to have ties with the Solar "Confederation" reportedly based
on the moons of Saturn.

The volume, titled "UFO: CONTACT FROM THE PLANET KOLDAS -- A COSMIC
DIALOGUE", is described as follows in an advertisement released by UFO
PHOTO ARCHIVES:

"...This 300-page report unfolds the story behind a powerful and special
friendship still continuing between two men -- one from beyond Earth.

"Valdar is the extraterrestrial human being who came to Earth in
preparation for his commissioning as the commander of an interplanetary
spacecraft. He lived near an electronics plant and worked closely with a
South African national for two years, before departing for his home planet
Koldas in another solar system.

"Valdar's two years of integrated living on a more primitively inhabited
planet was one last prerequisite to his new role as spaceship commander --
and he chose Earth, the unique planet a friend and mentor had also visited
during his own final indoctrination.

"Before his final selection of our planet, Valdar had been told by his
friend of Earth's rare beauty, its great variety of living species, vast
oceans, high plains, abundant vegetation -- and the unusual savageness of
its society.

"After some familiarization here, Valdar met and befriended F. Edwin W., a
South African working in Durban. The Report tells the story of this
friendship, a close relationship that has continued, up to and beyond
Valdar's departure for Koldas right before the eyes of his Earth-based
friend. The relationship continues today.

"More than 1,000 communications have been received (via electromagnetic
energy beams) from the extraterrestrial since Valdar's departure from
Earth.

"Many other witnesses and extensive documentation adequately support this
case. Important material collected by long-time UFO researcher Carl van
Vlierden includes color photographs and [an] ACTUAL PHONOGRAPH RECORDING of
the Koldasian commander delivering a heartfelt message to the people of
Earth.

"This comprehensive report is published through the generosity and special
interest of the Weaver family."

The UNICUS Group [Dept. 210., 1142 Manhattan Ave. #43., Manhattan, CA
90266], an organization allegedly devoted to 'Earthbound
Extraterrestrials', related much information in 1993 concerning the
research and work of a Mr. Robert M. Stanley.

Stanley has reportedly discovered a 'lost city' which he says was once
inhabited by ancients, whom he postulates may have been tied-in with
ancient 'Lemurians' (or rather the MU-rians of ancient California, a
civilization which is not to be confused with the 'theoretical' lost empire
of 'Lemuria' in the Indian Ocian - Branton). Some of the inhabitants of
this ancient city were 8 ft. tall and had access to interplanetary travel,
utilizing an ancient UFO 'base'.

Although Stanley has been to dozens of countries doing archaeological
research, he states that the lost city -- which he says largely resides in
a massive underground maze of tunnels and caves below a 'Mystic Mountain'
in southern California (Mojave region?) -- is the most incredible site by
far that he had ever encountered, and contains walls, statues and many
other ancient relics from the ancient culture which built the 'city'. He
has allegedly taken many scientists, engineers, archaeologists and
anthropologists to the ancient site and through the underground complex and
states that they agree with him on the incredible importance of the site,
but wonder why it never came to light before this time.

Although Stanley is reticent of revealing the exact site of the 'Mystic
Mountain' (on which he also claims, along with others, to have had
experiences with UFOs beaming 'lights' down upon the group), he states that
it is in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA and one might assume from previous
informations revealed that wherever this 'lost city' is located, it may
very well have been connected in some fashion to the lost city of the
Panamint Mountains.

Mr. Stanley can be reached through 'MYSTIC MOUNTAIN ADVENTURES'., Dept.
200., 1142 Manhattan Ave #43., M.B., CA 90266. However be warned that
Stanley is adamant in his conviction that he does not wish the site to be
turned into a 'tourist attraction' or amusement park with hot dog stands
and all the rest, but desires to keep the site in pristine condition for
the sake of future generations of researchers. However, if he sees that one
has true unselfish academic motivations rather than a 'treasure hunter'
mindset, one might be able to arrange a 'tour' of the site with him as have
others in the past.

William Halliday, in his book 'ADVENTURE IS UNDER- GROUND', records an
affidavit submitted by a Mr. Earl P. Dorr, describing vast caverns he and
an associate allegedly discovered and explored in Southern California.
Portions of the sworn testimonial are quoted below:

     "...These caverns are about 250 miles from Los Angeles,
     California. Traveling over state highways by automobile, the
     caverns can be reached in a few hours.

     "Accompanied by a mining engineer, I visited the caverns in the
     month of May, 1927. We entered them and spent 4 days exploring
     them for a distance of between 8 and 9 miles. We carried with us
     altimeters and pedometers, to measure the distance we traveled,
     and had an instrument to take measure- ments of distance by
     triangulation, together with such instruments convenient and
     necessary to make observations and estimations.

     "Our examinations revealed the following facts, viz:

     "1. From the mouth of the cavern we descended about 2000 feet.
     There, we found a canyon which, on our altimeter, measured about
     3000 to 3500 feet deep. We found the caverns to be divided into
     many chambers, filled and embellished with the usual stalactites
     and stalagmites, besides many grotesque and fantastic wonders
     that make the caverns one of the marvels of the world.

     "2. On the floor of the canyon there is a flowing river which by
     careful examination and measurement (by triangulation) we
     estimated to be about 300 feet wide, and with considerable depth.
     The river rises and falls with the tides of the sea -- at high
     tide, being approximately 300 feet wide, and at low tide,
     approximately 10 feet wide and 4 feet deep. (Obviously this can
     only mean that, if this account is true, the "source" of the
     river is an underground reservoir large enough to be moved by the
     tides, "overflowing" into the river during the high tides and
     "receding" at low tide - Branton)

     "3. When the tide is out there is exposed on both sides of the
     river from 100 to 150 feet of black beach sand which is very rich
     in gold values. The sands are from 4 to 11 feet deep. This means
     there are about 300 to 350 feet of rich bearing placer sand which
     averages 8 feet in depth. We explored the canyon sands a distance
     of 8 miles, finding little variation in the depth and width of
     the sands.

     "4. I am a practical miner of many years' experience and I own
     valuable mining properties nearby which I am willing to pledge
     and put up as security to guarantee that the statements herein
     are true.

     "5. My purpose of exploring the caverns was to study the
     mineralogy in order to ascertain the mineral possibilities and
     actualities of the caves, making such examination in person with
     my engineer necessary to determine by expert examination the
     character and quantity of mineral values of the caverns, rocks
     and sands.

     "6. I carried out about 10 lbs. of the black sand and 'panned'
     it, receiving more than $7 in gold. I sold it to a gold buyer who
     offered me at the rate of $18 per ounce. 2 1/2 lbs. of this black
     sand I sent to John Herman, assayer, whose assay certificate
     shows a value of $2145.47 per [cubic] yard, with gold at $20.67
     per ounce.

     "7. From engineering measurements and observations we made, I
     estimated that it would require a tunnel about 350 feet long to
     penetrate to the caverns, one thousand feet or more below the
     present entrance, which are some 3 miles distant from my
     property.

     "8. I make no estimate of even the approximate tonnage of the
     black sand, but some estimate of the cubical contents may be made
     for more than 8 miles and the minimum depth is never less than 3
     feet. They are of varying depth -- what their maximum depth may
     be we do not know. -- Sworn by E. P. Dorr., 309 Adena St.,
     Pasadena, Calif., November 16, 1934."

It is interesting that the "source" of this river would be some- where
within or beneath the great western desert of Utah-Nevada- California where
little surface water escapes by way of streams and rivers. Halliday in his
book also refers to a water-filled cave annexed to Death Valley, known as
"Devil's Hole", which according to some sources rises and falls slightly
with the tides! This may indicate that certain underground water-courses
below the Mojave Desert might ultimately connect with extensive underground
lakes or small underground fresh-water seas. Whether this theory proves
accurate or not remains to be seen... after future adventurous
'Speleonauts' make their way once again into Dorr's secret caverns and
toward the SOURCE of the 'alleged' underground river.

"Devil's Hole" itself contains a rare species of cave-fish found no-where
else in the world (at least nowhere that marine biologists are aware of).
It is reported that at least two divers disappeared in this apparently
'bottomless' aqua-cave some years ago, leading officials to put the cave
under government protection by making it an extension of Death Valley
National Monument -- much of which lies well BELOW sea level. The existence
of, or the possibility of the existence of, such underground 'seas' beneath
the California- Nevada regions seems to be supported by other accounts.
During the 'Shaver Mystery' years Ray Palmer received a letter from a
reader describing Earl Dorr's cave. This letter stated that three Paiute
Indian boys had, with the help of a 'treasure map', extracted $50,000 worth
of gold from these caverns, which they kept in the bank at Needle's,
California. Their project was halted when one of the boys slipped from one
of the lowest 'rock tiers' and died.

We will now quote from William R. Halliday's professional observations of
the claims made in Dorr's affidavit, as they appear in his book 'ADVENTURE
IS UNDERGROUND':

"...What is the gimmick?

"This was probably the question in the mind of every reader of the
CALIFORNIA MINING JOURNAL when this affidavit appeared in it's November,
1940, issue. The question still arises whenever a caver first hears the
remarkable story of this still more remarkable cave. Furthermore, the
answers to the other obvious questions are not those which might be
anticipated.

"'Is this just an imaginary cave?' No, the cave certainly exists. I have
been in it.

"'Did Dorr keep it's location secret?' No. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of
people know it's exact location, high on the side of Kokoweef Peak in the
Mojave Desert.

"'Has anyone tried to find this river of gold?' Yes, indeed. The prosperous
Crystal Cave Mining Corporation owns the property. "'Then what is the
gimmick?' That's quite a tale.

"The beginnings of the story of the cave of gold are shrouded in the mists
of the minds of old-timers. For a long time, prowling prospectors have
known of the existence of the wide mouth of a deep cavern on the limestone
flank of a peak which forms part of the east face of IVANPAH VALLEY --
Kokoweef Peak. Even though only four miles by dirt road from the highway
between LOS ANGELES and LAS VEGAS, the area was so desolate that, in the
1920's, weeks might elapse without the passing of more than an occasional
prospector and his burro. The opening of the cavern was several feet in
diameter and the cave was obviously much larger farther down. There were
local stories that it was bottomless, although it took 'only a few seconds'
for a rock to strike 'bottom'.

"Then someone found a narrow crack leading to ANOTHER cave, high on the
east face of the peak. Maybe it was Dorr. The stories vary. One version
repeats the common story of two Indians with a treasure map, which in this
case was supposed to have showed the entrance to the cave. Dorr was well
known in the area, having a claim across the valley, several miles
southwest of Kokoweef Peak. Like any experienced prospector, he certainly
prowled every ledge of the area. In any event, the new cave seemed even
deeper than Kokoweef Cave. Like at least seven other caves in California,
it eventually became known as Crystal Cave.

"Later, in 1934, another old prospector, Pete Ressler, was resting near the
bottom of the southwest slope of the barren peak. He idly tossed a rock
into a crack. To his surprise it rattled back and forth for a long time
until the sound died away into the depths. He strapped his load on his
burro and headed for Mountain Pass Station for dynamite.

"'What do you think it is, Pete?' the men at the station asked him.

"'Quien sabe?' he shrugged.

"Pete's Spanish, however, was horrible. It sounded like 'Kin Savvy' or 'Kin
Sabe,' and this name stuck to the cave he dynamited open. It wasn't much of
a cave. It slanted downward, but was filled with rubble (rubble from the
dynamite blasts? - Branton) to a level not far below the entrance. Old Pete
dropped out of the story. Dorr is the main character.

"Dorr must have been a strange person. No one else was particularly
interested in the caves, but soon he was telling of an enormous cavern into
which he was gradually making his way, trip after trip. The main part of
the cave was a series of vertical drops from one small chamber to another.
In several areas there were small, dry pools which contained sharp little
crystals. From one of the small rooms a tight tunnel led a relatively short
distance to a huge cavern containing a chasm 3,000 feet deep. He told of a
stalactite 1,500 feet long (Note: Both Kokoweef and Door peaks are near the
SW flank of the Ivanpah Mts., just south of Highway 91. Dorr alleged that
he and his engineer, following the upper rock 'tiers', discovered a huge
cataract or waterfall cascading down the side of the 'canyon' below what
they judged to be Dorr Peak. They allegedly followed the upper 'shelves'
for 8 miles. According to a map of the caves drawn by Herman Wallace Jr.,
under the personal instruction and supervision of Earl Dorr, the length of
the 'stalactite' was given at only 500 feet long -- although this would
still make it the largest "known" stalactite in the world at this writing
-- and was located adjacent to the underground waterfall which flowed into
the underground river at the bottom of the canyon as one of its many
tributaries. - Branton).

"The cavern went on for miles. He had walked to the brink of the chasm, but
had not found a way to it's bottom. There were places where air came into
the cavern, so other caves on the peak must open into it. And there ought
to be an entrance somewhere on his claim, too. That was the direction the
cave headed.

"Before long Dorr was claiming to have found a way down the wall of the
subterranean canyon. Down below the wonders were even greater. He had found
great deposits of placer gold. By this time he had the other old-timers
half convinced. Still, THEY weren't going into that awful-looking hole for
all the gold in the U.S. Mint.

"One day in 1928 Dorr again told his friends that he was going into the
cave for another trip. Two days passed, three, four. His friends became
worried. Gold would not tempt them to go into the cave, but they were his
friends and the code of the desert is stern. Dorr might be trapped there,
hurt, dying. A rescue party climbed to the mouth of the cave, where Dorr's
ropes were still fixed.

"Hardly had they all entered the cave when they met a raging Dorr they
hardly know. Although disheveled and wild-eyed, he was obviously in no need
of rescuing. Nervously they shrank away from his needless fury. Had he gone
mad from his long stay underground? (More likely it was the dreaded 'gold
fever' which has affected the minds of men throughout the centuries and has
often motivated them to acts of irrational cruelty - Branton) They were
trying to help him, yet he was accusing them of trying to steal his gold.

"Before they quite understood, they felt the dull impact of a HEAVY charge
of dynamite. Then Dorr calmed down. 'You'll never get it now,' he smirked.

"'That blast finished the tunnel to the river of gold.' (Interesting Note:
Halliday himself claims to have seen within this cave, along with several
National Speleological Society or NSS members, the name of DORR written in
black miner's lamp soot near what appeared to be a black line left by a
dynamite fuse, below which was a plugged area of shattered rock - Branton)

"We do not know whether Dorr was ever convinced that his friends were only
trying to rescue him. For several years he was a familiar figure in the
Mojave Desert. Continually he attempted to persuade people to run a tunnel
into the cave of gold from the lower slopes of Kokoweef Peak. He would go
shares with them. If they were willing to pay for the tunnel, they could
have part of the profits.

"On this basis few investors were willing to consider the project. Finally,
however, a small group headed by a Los Angeles capitalist was willing to
speculate on Dorr's proposition. First, they tried the easy expedients. Kin
Sabe Cave was the most accessible. Dorr thought it connected with the great
chasm.

"They installed an inclined railway track and began to remove the rubble
which filled it. Before long they had quite a respectable cave, 125 feet
deep, but the air in it was completely stagnant. Over Dorr's protests, they
abandoned the attempt. If there was an entrance to the great cavern from
Kin Sabe, it was too deep to bother with, at least until all easier
possibilities had been investigated.

"Next they turned their attention to Kokoweef Cave, the first cavern
discovered on the peak. A road was built to a nearby ledge and a short
tunnel was drilled, connecting the bottom of the cavern to the surface of
the peak. Again, much rubble was removed without encountering the true
bottom. Operations were in full swing when someone discovered a mineral
vein in the wall of the peak a few dozen yards from the tunnel. It was
zinc, and high- grade ore. Because of the war zinc was at a premium. The
Crystal Cave Mining Company promptly went into the zinc business. Dorr was
disgusted. He abandoned the project. Occasionally someone would hear of
him, still telling his story of prowling the hills near his old claim,
still seeking another entrance to the cave of gold..."

According to 'Sasquatch Researcher' Virginia Louis Swanson, 'Devil's Hole,'
in Death Valley National Monument, NE of Death Valley Junction, CA., has
been the scene of at least one disappearance. According to Swanson, two
boys entered the cave several years ago and were never seen again. Navy
scuba diver's were lowered on cables and reported seeing a large river
which roared up from below, flowing across a wide expanse. They could not
estimate it's depth because of a myriad of colonnades of black rock through
which the river flowed before plunging once again down an abyss. The cave
is somewhere NEAR 'Devil's Hole' (which is still open to public view,
although 'fenced in'), and was allegedly sealed shortly after the
disappearance.

It is interesting that Vincent Bugliosi, in his book HELTER SKELTER (pp.
232-233, 246) refers to Charles Manson, who believed that his 'mission' was
to start a race war called 'Helter Skelter', then hide with his so-called
'family' in an underground area near the Mojave Desert called the
'Bottomless Pit', and then emerge after the 'war' was over and rule the
world. Once version states that the Manson "family" had met with "strange
people" out in the Mojave desert. Was he "programmed"? Manson was also
convinced that he was Adolph Hitler's illegitimate son.

One interesting bit of information was related by Robert K. Newkirk, in a
letter in AMAZING STORIES Magazine, April, 1949 issue, p. 140, stating that
northern California's "...Clear Lake has many underground caverns that we
know have no endings and others that run to S.F. bay."

Another anomalous account was related by Jack Peterson in a letter in
SHAVERTRON, issue No. 14, describing the writer's own experience near June
Lake, CA, where he allegedly observed a small humanoid being (a gray?)
coming out of a strange cone- shaped machine which emerged from the depths
of the earth. The alien then re-entered the craft, following which its
machine disappeared back the way it had come.

Turning for a moment from the subject of subterranean activity, we once
again turn our sights toward the stars. Those who have been involved with
research into UFOs, Underground Bases, and Secret Governments for any
length of time will realize just how interconnected Aerial, Subsurface and
Social phenomena actually is behind the scenes. For instance Forest
Crawford's account of the recovery of a craft from Tau Ceti also involved
underground bases and transportation systems, as well as top secret
government activity.

In addition to Crawford's account, we have a corroborating report which
appeared in 'THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA', by John Spencer (Avon Books., 1993).
Under the heading 'DR. OTTO STROVE', we read how this astrophysicist
assisted Frank Drake in establishing Project OZMA, and it's very mysterious
conclusion:

     "...the project began its search by focusing on the star TAU
     CETI. According to claims made at the time, AS SOON AS the
     project got underway STRONG INTELLIGENT SIGNALS were picked up,
     leaving all the scientists stunned.

     "Abruptly, Dr. Strove then declared Project OZMA had been shut
     down, and commented that there was no sensible purpose for
     listening to messages from another world."

     (Note: Or, was this merely an 'excuse' used by the secret
     government to keep the Project and it's findings SECRET? It would
     seem that Frank Drake -- and Dr. Strove for that matter -- has or
     had some connection with the Illuminati, as the Illuminati
     usually does not allow someone of Drake's influence for instance
     to operate with impunity. Usually people of such influence in
     economics, media, science, education, religion and politics are
     either 'bought off' or blacklisted. Frank Drake, with his
     influence within the underground bases and disk recovery
     operations, is very obviously not on the Illuminati's "black
     list" - Branton)

Back to the underground bases, UFOs, etc., -- Jimmy Ward, in a letter
submitted to GRAY BARKER'S NEWSLETTER (Aug. 1982, No. 16 issue), referred
to an announcement made by the Canadian Research Council in 1942 of plans
for constructing a vast underground complex to be built by AVRO Corp.,
which was to cover an area of about 75 square miles in the region between
British Columbia and Alberta, bordering on the State of Washington on the
south, and the Peace River district on the north. No further word of the
project has been released.

Leslie Watkins, in his book 'ALTERNATIVE 003' (First published in London,
reprinted by Avon Books, N.Y., 1978. 239 pp.) quotes from an 'interview'
with a government official who told of the Government's knowledge of entire
ancient cities, linked by an elaborate complex of tunnels, far below the
surface of the earth, which were lighted by a strange greenish
luminescence, and the remains of which have been found under many parts of
the world.
