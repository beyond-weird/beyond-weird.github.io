There have been SEVERAL documented cases of mysterious disappearances of
persons in connection with subsurface and/or aerial phenomena. One such
account involves the ancient Greek "Temple of Apollo", in Hierapolis (now
Pamukkale), Turkey. This city was once part of the ancient Grecian empire,
which covered an extensive area in and around the Mediterranean sea. One
article which appeared in the January, 1989 issue of OMNI Magazine,
referred to strange disappearances which had taken place in a cavern
adjacent these ancient temple ruins. The article quoted from the writings
of the ancient Greek philosopher 'Strabe' (who lived between 63 B.C. and 24
A.D.), to the effect that animals would often enter the cave and never
return.

Also MANY PEOPLE throughout history who went past the mouth of the cave
never returned. The article also quoted one Sheldon Aaronson, a professor
of microbiology at Queens College, N.Y., who told OMNI that several
Australian students had entered the cave and disappeared just a few days
before his visit in 1987. Sheldon stated: "The Turkish government put iron
bars over the opening to prevent other people from ever going in. As far as
we knew, the Australians were never seen again." According to the article,
the Greeks believed that the cavern was an opening into the "land of the
dead ruled by the gods of the underworld."

As for the possibility of an underground subterranean 'world', scientists
tell us that the lowest depths of the earth (upper and lower mantles)
contain temperature and pressure extremes so great that physical life could
not possibly exist there. Some however believe that there is evidence for
the existence of a vast global network of CRUSTAL geothermal and
hydrothermal cavities, some of these having been connected to the ancient
deluge wherein the "...fountains of the great deep were broken up". This
allegedly occurred as magma-heated stratas of subterranean water-filled
caverns (brought to enormous pressures by an expanding and over-heated
mantle) suddenly burst through the crust (Gen. 7:11), like a pressure
boiler of enormous proportions suddenly splitting it seams.

Looking at a map of the ocean floors, one can see what seems to be a
"seam", similar to the seams of a baseball, which in ancient times
apparently split or ripped its way around the entire planet. These "seams"
are known as "rifts" in the ocean floor. Some have claim that the
underlying basaltic rock layers within these ancient and gigantic global
aqua-systems were dissolved into these global sub- terranean reservoirs as
their temperatures and pressures increased. Eventually the pressure became
so great that at the weakest point this global layer of mineralized water
broke through, and the tear made its way around the world at an incredible
rate. It is not difficult to imagine that such a cataclysm may have caused
the sinking of ancient land masses as the underlying mega-aquifers emptied
out and the overlying layers lost their support. Vast amounts of this
overheated water -- which had previously been dissolving the basaltic rock
layers surrounding it -- exploded to the surface, thus explaining why the
oceans now contain a large percentage of 'salt' content. These underlying
chambers, many of which collapsed yet many of which apparently remained
intact, are believed to exist throughout the moho and crustal regions of
the planet, just above the upper mantle. This 'Mohorovicic Discontinuity',
or boundary point between the upper crust and lower mantle, is 'on the
average' a dozen or so miles below the surface -- or from a few miles below
the ocean trenches to a few dozen miles below large mountain ranges. So it
is possible that caverns of immense extent, containing life-supporting
conditions, may conceivably exist to depths of 40-50 miles, especially
under the larger mountain ranges. Below that (beyond the Moho) the pressure
and temperature extremes would make physical life unbearable, if not
impossible.

Other higher-level cavities created through geo-seismic activity may also
exist, cavities which may dwarf the Flint Ridge- Mammoth Caves of Kentucky
or New Mexico's Carlsbad- Lechuguilla cavern systems. It is suggested that
THESE may contain conditions sufficient to support physical life (i.e. air,
water, subterranean flora and fauna, and perhaps even electro-
magnetically-induced illumination diffused throughout the underground
"atmosphere" through a phenomena somewhat similar to the effect produced by
the Aurora Borealis or "Northern Lights". In this case it has been
suggested that powerful electro- magnetic currents moving through the earth
and interacting with the underground atmosphere may account for the
diffused twilight illumination permeating the underground atmosphere, as
has been described in various accounts of those who claim to have managed
to find their way into the more extensive and deeper cavern systems).

There have been several accounts concerning individuals who have
encountered human beings -- some who spoke the native language and others
who spoke a language entirely foreign -- within deep underground tunnels
and caverns. There are many such cases, but we will concern ourselves with
only one of these at this point (and will reserve the others for later in
the text)... an incident which may be one the most well-known and most
well- documented accounts of this type:

Sometime during the 12 century, a monastic chronicler in England by the
name of "Gervase of Tilbury" recorded a strange account of two "children"
who suddenly appeared near a small town near Bury St. Edmunds, England. The
account was also recorded in the writings of several other chroniclers who
lived at the time or sometime afterwards. These include: William of Newbury
-- HISTORIA RERUM ANGLICARUM, written in Yorkshire, England (1136-1198?);
Abbot Ralph of Coggeshall -- CHRONICON ANGLICARUM; and also the chroniclers
Giraldus Cambrensis and Walsingham. The account was more recently related
in FLYING SAUCERS UNCENSORED, by Harold T. Wilkins (Citadel Press., New
York, N.Y. 1955., pp. 97-98). From their combined accounts we can piece
together the following bizarre story which the chroniclers swore to be
true:

One warm, sunny day in the 12th century some farmers and other residents of
the small town of Wolfpittes, England (some seven miles distant from the
larger village of Burry St. Edmunds) were startled to see two young
children wandering around, as if disoriented, in some ancient 'pits' or
'trenches' known to the locals as the 'Wolf-Pitts' -- after which the small
village had taken it's name. These excavations were ancient, but no one
seemed to know when or by whom they were dug, but the consensus was that
they were at least partly artificial, and very ancient. The most shocking
thing about the children, which the residents of Wolfpittes encountered,
was that they had skin which was olive-green in colour, yet the rest of
their features were as human as the average Englishman.

The villagers attempted to communicate with the children but were
unsuccessful, as they soon discovered that the young boy and girl spoke a
language which was completely unfamiliar to the villagers. The townspeople
had compassion on the children and took them to the village and offered
them various different kinds of food, all of which they seemed unfamiliar
with and which they refused. However, when they were shown some beanstalks,
they took them greedily, but instead of opening the bean-pods, the children
attempted to open the stalks themselves, as if they had been accustomed to
opening stalks in this way (apparently a practice they had learned in the
land from which they emerged). Upon finding nothing in the stalks, the
children began to weep. Unfortunately, the shock of entering our world was
too much for the young boy, and even though he became partly acclimated to
other forms of food, he nevertheless became weaker and weaker and finally
died as few years afterwards. The young girl, however, adjusted quite well
to her new surroundings. In fact she eventually grew into a mature,
beautiful woman, and later married a gentleman from the nearby town of
Kings Lynn. As time passed, her husband patiently instructed her in the
complexities of the English language, and soon she was able to communicate
fairly well, and the story she told of where she had come from and how she
had arrived in our 'world' with her brother was even more incredible.

She told her husband that her people all had skin similar to hers, or
rather similar to what her skin had once been like, as over a period of
years and exposure to the outer elements the greenish tinge had left her.
She described her world as a cavernous, subterranean country of enormous
size, a country which went by the name of "St. Martin's Land." The land in
which she lived was described as 'twilight' in nature, yet there was a
large underground river, on the other side of which there was another land
more brightly lit. One day, she and her brother were herding some type of
underground animal when they heard something like the sound of 'bells'
emerging from one of the cave passages or tunnels which lined the perimeter
of this underground land. Out of extreme curiosity, they entered this
tunnel and followed the passage upwards for what could have been a few
days, although in their underground land it is probable that they did not
have any concept of what 'day' or 'night' was. After their long and weary
journey up the steep incline they suddenly emerged into the brilliant
sunlight of the British countryside. The change from their twilight world
was dramatic, and the children walked around in the pits or trenches
starved, half-blinded and disoriented. They shortly afterwards attempted to
re-locate the small opening through which they had emerged, but were unable
to do so, because of the blinding light. At about this point the farmers
found the children and took them to the village.

A somewhat similar incident 'may' have been repeated in the small hamlet of
Banjos (or Banos) Spain in August of 1887, several hundred years after the
incident at Wolfpittes and several hundred miles distant. We state that it
MAY have been repeated to some degree simply because there appears to be
some confusion surrounding the Banjos account, apparently due to the
possibility that some well-meaning researcher may have confused the two
incidents, in essence attributing some of the events that in fact took
place near Wolfpittes with the Banjos account. Basically, the Banjos
incident reportedly involved two children with greenish skin who emerged
from a CAVERN near the town (not 'pits' or 'excavations'), spoke an unknown
language, and so on, although the details are sketchy. Some of the accounts
of the Banjos incident repeat the Wolfpittes story almost verbatim, as if,
as we said, someone somewhere mistakenly confused the two events, perhaps
due to a lack of detail in the Banjos, Spain account.

Whatever the case, it seems that SOMETHING of this general nature also
occurred in this Spanish hamlet, even though the exact sources of that
particular story are more difficult to trace than are the sources for the
Wolfpittes account. Paris Flammonde refers to this account in his book: THE
AGE OF FLYING SAUCERS (Hawthorn Books, N.Y., p. 197), having learned it
from an article in the September, 1967 issue of ORBIT Magazine, which in
turn gave credit to an article in the Vol. XII, August 1967 issue of Dan
Fry's UNDERSTANDING Magazine. Fry claimed that he got the story from an
article by John Macklin which appeared in the December, 1966 issue of GRIT
Magazine. The account also appears in John Macklin's book STRANGE DESTINIES
(Ace Books., N.Y.); Jacques Bergier's LES EXTRA- TERRESTRES; and the July
22, 1970 issue of the British periodical 'WEEKEND'.

There are those who believe that similar cavern systems exist below the
Southwest United States, and that the Dulce base in New Mexico was
originally an entrance to one of these ancient underground kingdoms.
Sources say that the humans, possibly the ancestors of the Pueblos, once
ruled this under- ground kingdom. One abductee reported an "abduction"
wherein he saw himself traveling in a craft through an immense cavern below
the Grand Canyon. In one end of the cavern were the "ruins" of an ancient
city, and in one of the walls he could see what appeared to be an elevator
type of device that ascended the wall and disappeared through the roof.

In 1994 a file appeared over the Internet which originated from a person
who claimed to be involved in a secret group of Hopi Indian youth, boys and
girls, who were being trained by Hopi elders and a race of human-like
aliens code-named the "BLUES". The Blues were "star warriors" who were in
conflict with the Grays, which they referred to as the "Children of the
Serpent", a race of psychic vampires which feed off the passions, and in
some cases the blood, of human beings. The Blues (the "Children of the
Feather") were one of several human-like races that had warned our
government from having anything to do with the Grays in the first place.
The reptilians have established themselves in the underground systems below
the 4-corners area, in the VERY SYSTEMS from which the Hopis themselves
were driven by the reptilian sorcerers in ancient times. The Hopis emerged
through a cave in the Grand Canyon and, according to Hank Krastman who
claims to have visited the underground city of Palatkwapi below Arizona,
the Hopis today (both surface and subsurface dwelling) still consider the
Grays of the 4-corners systems and elsewhere to be their enemies. Krastman
says that the residents of Palatkwapi maintain some interaction with the
neo-Mayan races of Mt. Shasta who maintain a large underground city near
Prescott/Groom Creek, Arizona. They have also interbred with members of the
Nordic or 'Pleiadean' Federation.

In relation to Dulce, researcher Paris Flammonde once gave what appears to
be a description of the joint Illuminati-Gray 'Dulce' underground
base-network below the 4-corners area, as described by researcher James
Moseley:

     "...The intimations of strange pressure groups, purportedly
     intent upon obscuring the true meaning of Flying Saucers, began
     arising in the early 1950's, the most famous of these being the
     'three men in black' and the 'silence conspiracy,' which Major
     Keyhoe and others regard as an ominous element functioning within
     the Air Force. During the summer of 1956, SAUCER NEWS editor
     James Moseley postulated an addition to this enigmatic company in
     the June, 1956, issue of his magazine. Theorizing that Flying
     Saucers were originally being researched by the United States in
     1946, were capable of speeds exceeding four thousand miles an
     hour, and were operating from a super- secret subterranean base
     below a southwestern state, he continued:

     "'The whole project is so highly classified that ordinary
     military pilots and even the Air Force's saucer investigators on
     Project Blue Book could not possibly know about it. In fact, this
     type of saucer IS NOT built by the American Government AS WE
     ORDINARILY UNDERSTAND THE WORD 'GOVERNMENT.' As fantastic as this
     might sound... these saucers are actually built, operated, and
     maintained by an organization which is ENTIRELY SEPARATE from the
     military and political branches of the Government that we know
     about. Although a handful of people at the very top of the
     Government know about the existence of this project, they have no
     direct contact with it... I shall call this secret project, 'The
     Organization.'"

James Moseley, according to Flammonde, "considerably elaborated on the
activities of this shadowy cabal with some very extravagant revelations."

In his book "ON THE SHORES OF ENDLESS WORLDS", Andrew Tomas relates the
following account:

     "The Jesuit Agnelio Oliva (1572-1542) recorded the words of an
     old Inca quipu reader to the effect that the real Tiahuanaco was
     a subterranean city exceeding the one above ground in vastness.
     It was believed that the entrance to the underground apartments
     could be gained through four tunnels. Last century one passage
     was evidently found as treasure hunters managed to get in, to
     look for gold, but only one came out. He brought out with him two
     gold bars but left behind his sanity. After this incident the
     Peruvian government decided to wall up the cave entrance..." This
     tunnel, according to other sources, was actually hidden among the
     ruins of Fort Sacsahuaman outside of and above the city of Cuzco,
     Peru. The explorers allegedly found their way into ancient
     treasure caves beneath the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, and most
     of them subsequently became lost in the dark labyrinthine maze,
     except for the man who returned with two gold bars. There are
     however 'rumors' that the tunnels beneath Cuzco eventually
     connect with others below Lima, Peru -- as well as different
     parts of the Peruvian Andes including the Lake Titicaca region.

Dr. Clifford Wilson, in his 'UFOS AND THEIR MISSION IMPOSSIBLE' (1974.,
Signet Books, N.Y.) relates the following account, submitted by Police
Officer and 'abductee' Harold Schirmer (spelled 'Shermer' by others), who
was the subject of experimentation by the alien group known as the 'greys':

"He...claimed that he was told where UFO bases were. Although he could not
understand it, he stated there were UFO bases both underground and
underwater. He wondered if perhaps these beings were careful to guard their
own interests, for they gave no information that would actually endanger
themselves. However, they did say that one base was out in the ocean away
from Florida, out toward Bermuda. This is in the area of the infamous
'Bermuda Triangle' where so many ships and even aircraft have mysteriously
disappeared during this century.

"Schirmer was further told that this particular vehicle was an observation
craft, and that the occupants had been sent to collect samples of animals
and vegetation. He remembered also that he was told that SOME HUMANS HAD
BEEN USED in breeding experiments. He was convinced that something was done
to the BRAIN PATTERNS of those who were captured, and was definite that he
himself had been changed -- as was evidenced by his earlier withholding of
details of the sighting. By his obedience he had become almost robotlike,
ready to do whatever they told him to do."

On July 14th, 1974 an article by Stoney Brakefield appeared in the
Pennsylvania newspaper, NEWS EXTRA, reporting an incident which allegedly
took place in 1944 near this small coal mining town, yet because of it's
nature it had been covered-up for nearly 40 years until the son of the
mining inspector who investigated the incident revealed it as his father
(then deceased) had related it to him.

This mining inspector and a fellow investigator had been called-in to look
into a "cave-in" in one of the Dixonville mines. About 15 men had either
been killed or turned up missing altogether in the strange disaster. Once
inside the mine the inspectors eventually came across the first victim.
Although lying under a broken timber surrounded by some fallen rocks and
rubble, they concluded that the cave-in certainly could not have been large
enough to kill the man. The inspectors were shocked to find that the body
of the miner was lacerated with claw-like markings from some unknown
creature. They continued and found a few other bodies, all dead and some of
which had similar claw-like marks covering them. Several other miners had
vanished, and were nowhere to be seen in spite of subsequent diggings. This
tragedy apparently took place after the miners had broken into an ancient
tunnel of unknown origin deep in the mine. This tunnel (at the time the
inspectors didn't fully recognize it as the recently discovered passage or
drift) was then followed by the inspectors at approximately a 45 degree
angle downwards for about half a mile until they arrived at a 'room' which
'seemed' to be the end of the passage. At this point the passage behind
them just 'happened' to collapse (many accounts indicate that these
underground creatures can manipulate the earth and rock and create
"cave-ins" at will, as was the case in the Maltese incident mentioned
earlier in the text).

A follow-up team was sent in to intersect the inspectors while this was
taking place. This other crew followed the tracks of the inspectors into
the mysterious tunnel and eventually found the "cave-in" and began digging
through in hopes of finding the now missing investigators. In the meanwhile
one inspector (the father of the man who released the story to the press)
suddenly felt something like "hot breath" on the back of his neck. He
closed his eyes, too terrified to see what the 'thing' was. As the other
workers were breaking through, the 'creature' left by some unseen route,
perhaps frightened away. The other inspector who was with him however
observed the whole thing and in wild-eyed horror he exclaimed, "That thing
was not of this world!"

One account concerning 'the underground' appeared in an early issue of
CAVEAT EMPTOR magazine (P.O. Box 4553., Metuchen, NJ 08820-4533), and spoke
of a physical encounter with a subterranean race HUMANS. The account was
related by an individual whose girlfriend, 'Laressa', had phoned him one
night. She was quite shaken up and in tears, and told him that a friend of
hers at school had invited her to go for a ride with her out into the
countryside. This girl friend was somewhat strange, and a loner and would
often disappear and be away from school for days or even weeks at a time.
As they were driving through the countryside, according to 'Laressa', this
girl drove her car right towards a hill and before she knew what was
happening the hill opened up into an underground 'road' and they eventually
found themselves right in the middle of an underground city. She went on to
say that the city was inhabited by the 'D-Forces', a human group who used
the symbol of a 'wolf' (on jewelry, etc.), and who were in conflict with
another human group called the 'T-Forces'. Both, she learned, possessed
'UFO' type craft, and the T-Forces were less powerful but were growing
stronger day by day.

Could this somehow tie-in with Richard Shaver's scenario of an under-
ground battle with 'Deros' and 'Teros'? The only difference would be that
Shaver's 'Teros' were basically friendly people and his 'Deros' seemed to
be a conglomeration of degenerate human techno-sorcerers whose minds and
bodies have been affected by long-tern exposure to radiation, who seemed to
be in league with a 'race' power-hungry Atlantean androids that had gone
out-of-control thousands of years ago AND what Shaver refers to as the
"vermin from space", a race of reptilian hominoids that are returning to
planet earth to reclaim what they allege to be their native planet.

Theodore Illion, in his book 'DARKNESS OVER TIBET', told of the inhabitants
of an underground city beneath Tibet, a city which the author himself
claimed to have stumbled on during his extensive travels through the Far
East. This underground community was allegedly ruled over by a powerful
sorcerer who was part of an international secret society. This overlord
kept the inhabitants of the underground city, many of whom were people who
had 'disappeared' from the world above, under complete mind control to the
point that they lacked any personality -- their eyes were reported by
Illion as being vacant and empty, and their lives emotionless and
drone-like, much like an ant colony. Or in other words, they acted much
like certain of the 'MIB'-like beings who have been encountered by UFO
witnesses. This sorcerer was allegedly in contact with an infernal
(reptilian?) race via a 'bottomless shaft' which descended through the city
itself. When Ted Illion asked the sorcerer-overlord where the shaft led, he
was told that if he found out he would die: "...there are such secrets."
Illion claimed that he barely escaped the hypnotic hold of the sorcerer and
fled the city, and after surviving a series of terrifying poltergeist and
psychic attacks directed at him by the sorcerer, he finally found his way
back to civilization and safe?

At this point we will quote from one of the many sources describing
encounters with what may very well be a remnant of an antediluvian 'tunnel'
network that the Atlanteans or their contemporaries had constructed before
the deluge. The following account was given in a letter which was submitted
to AMAZING STORIES (which described itself as a science fiction/science
fact magazine), Dec. 1946 issue, p. 162. The letter was from a George A.
Lehew of (at the time) 1918 W. Newport Ave., Chicago, ILL. Lehew wrote:

     "Sirs... I have been a reader of AMAZING STORIES for a very long
     time... I too, know of one of these entrances into the world
     below. It is about fifty miles south of Pittsburgh, Pa., in the
     first range of the Allegheny Mountains. My experiment with the
     caves have been only partial explorations, consisting of
     traveling about a mile and a quarter down into the cave itself,
     and returning. The cave IS VENTILATED from below, and stays at a
     constant 50 degrees no matter what the outside temperature may
     be. It is a series of rooms or galleries with narrow passages
     from one to another. In about the sixth room down, there is a
     large tree trunk which could not have come from the surface as
     the stratosphere (sic: 'strata-sphere'? - Branton) is almost
     completely free from local fault; and it could never have come
     DOWN through the openings in the cave itself as they were small
     at the top, and kept getting progressively larger as they got
     deeper.

     "I traveled down as long as I could find comparatively easy
     travel -- about 45 degree descent all the way -- and finally came
     to what I thought must be the end of the cave, for I could see no
     more openings into rooms, but on closer examination found instead
     a bore, about six feet across, straight down into solid rock. I
     turned my flash downward and could see that it must have gone
     straight down for at least a hundred feet, the sides were
     perfectly smooth, and the shaft, or bore, in a perfect round --
     no apparent irregularities anywhere -- I had no way of descending
     any further, so I retraced my steps back up through the different
     rooms to the top of the mountain where the cave opens into this
     world. I made discreet inquiries of several old timers in that
     region, and found that in 1915, or about that year, six surveyors
     took gear and equipment, and spent a month in exploration of the
     cave, going 18 miles from the entrance, and down almost five
     miles below sea level. I have never gone back, but I hope to some
     day in the future, with escort, equipment, and supplies. I'd
     certainly love to see the machine that made that bore! If you
     have any information on other caves in that area, let me know --
     they too may tie in with this one, though if they do, their
     connections are very deep. Also, if you can, please describe the
     equipment that made that vertical shaft. Oh, yes, one more
     interesting item -- the surveyors in their exploration of the
     cave, distinctly heard the rumble of MACHINERY -- but their
     calculations proved they were nowhere near a large city
     (surface), and they were too deep for surface noises otherwise.
     What is the answer?"

Another account also dealing with subsurface phenomena and 'creatures'
appeared in the June, 1945 issue of AMAZING STORIES, in a letter submitted
to that magazine by Jerry LaPriore (at the time) of 2024 Pleasant St., Fall
River, Mass. The letter stated:

     "You asked for stories that might relate to... the caves. My
     mother was told this story by an old man who said it was true as
     truth itself: This man and a friend were hunting, agreeing this
     time to go to a portion of the wood's to which they did not
     normally go. They saw a deer and gave chase. It jumped through a
     clump of bushes and they followed -- to find themselves
     unaccountably in the strangest surroundings. They were in a huge
     cavern that had numerous passageways leading from it. Before them
     was a monster-like man they thought was the Devil himself. The
     monster stared, and the two men stared back. One of them fainted
     from fear, and the man who told my mother the story dragged the
     other away in panic, and as he did so, found himself just as
     mysteriously in the forest again. The old man's friend died a
     week later as a result of the shock he had suffered. The old man
     tried later to find the cave again, but failed. I know this story
     is true because my mother does not tell fairy tales and because
     she believes it."

In April, 1972 a reader submitted a letter to FATE magazine describing
what, if true, may be one of the more remarkable 'encounters' with a
subterranean civilization. The letter, which appeared below the heading
'SPIRITS OR SUBTERRANEAN BEINGS', stated:

     "Two years ago my small son Danny and I were playing in his
     bedroom when we heard a sharp metallic sound as if a large steel
     hammer had struck the concrete BASEMENT floor three times. It
     took us so by surprise that Danny began to cry. I was merely
     curious because I had heard a noise like that several months
     earlier in or beneath the living room.

     "I decided to lie down on the bedroom floor with my ear to it. I
     clearly heard the roar of MACHINERY or I should say a 'hum.' As I
     listened I heard something or somebody moving around and
     fidgeting with what sounded like machinery.

     "I quickly got up and fetched a small hammer from my husband's
     took chest and began to tap the floor, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc. I had
     continued for about five minutes when to my surprise the 'being'
     beneath the floor began to tap back, 1-2-3, 1-2-3. As I listened
     I heard a series of noises and knocks and then a MAN'S voice
     began to speak, not to me but to someone else. His words were too
     muffled to understand.

     "I called the local police and asked if there were any
     underground installations in our town and they said there were
     not.

     "Frequently after that I would place my ear to the floor and
     always I could hear the hum of machinery but never again the
     man's voice.

     "It is my opinion that races of people live far beneath the earth
     in vast networks of caverns and they have access to miracle
     machinery that can project sound and even images to the earth's
     surface. I wonder if we are confusing these subterranean beings
     with spirits? -- WANDA LOCKWOOD, BAKERSFIELD, CALIF."

One researcher by the name of Frank D. Adams has written about the results
of his own personal scientific experiments which may prove that giant
cavities exist in granite at depths of more than 11 miles, conclusions
which have also been supported by Louis V. King, a mathematician who
calculated that, at normal temperatures, a cavity would exist at a depth of
between 17.2 and 20.9 miles. The authors' findings are also supported by
the recently discovered "16 Rouse Belts" which give planes of fracture
penetrating the globe.

Dr. Ron Anjard, in an article in the Summer, 1978 issue of PURSUIT
Magazine, claimed personal knowledge of 44 underground cities beneath the
surface of North America, six of which are alleged to be on the West Coast.
His information comes from anonymous American Indian sources. When we
relate this to the large number of migration legends (to and from cavern
realms) which exist among the native Amerindians, then we may conclude that
certain tribes still retain intimate knowledge of underground civilizations
who are related to them via distant ancestral links. In the case of the
Hopi Indians, according to Dr. Hank Krastman, certain Hopi elders maintain
contact with their subterranean cousin-tribes to this day. There are also
indications that some entire tribes literally moved underground as a result
of the encroaching Anglosaxon invasion of the America's. Similar
allegations are made in relation to the Mayas, the Incas, and several other
Central and South American tribes as well.

Karl Brugger, in his book 'THE CHRONICLE OF AKAKOR' (Boohi Tree Books.,
Delacorte Press., N.Y., 230 pp), gives the history -- as given to the
author by one of their chiefs -- of the Ugha Mongulala tribesman, whose
ancestors were allegedly part of a vast empire which covered South America
in ancient times. Some of these ancient people, the chief claimed, left the
planet in aerial vessels to explore other parts of the solar system and
beyond, leaving behind vast subterranean cities beneath the Andes mountains
and western Brazil. In 1971, due to the constant encroachment of white
settlers or invaders into their territory, 30,000 survivors of the Ugha
Mongulala allegedly escaped to this ancient system of underground cities,
consisting of 13 separate subterranean complexes all connected by tunnels,
one of which is said to extend to Lima, and others of which are located
throughout the Andes Mountain range of Peru.

Michael Burke, in his article 'GREEN THING SPARKS RUMORS' (THE VALLEY NEWS
DISPATCH, New Kensington, Tarentum and Vandergrift, PA., Mar. 5, 1981
issue) described a short 'lizard' like creature which has been seen walking
on two legs like a man, was reportedly about 3-ft tall, and "half humanoid
and half dinosaur". The creature was seen emerging from a sewer tunnel near
New Kensington. A group of children chased the infant or young dinosauroid,
one of the more courageous of them momentarily grabbing it from behind, at
which point it let out a squealing or screeching sound, and then slipped
from his hands and escaped back into the sewer tunnel. In later encounters
children attempted to pour gasoline on the creature and light it on fire,
although most of the fuel fell on the ground, and the reptilioid escaped
unscathed.

Dr. Earlyne Chaney, in an article titled 'ODYSSEY INTO EGYPT' (which
appeared in her occult-oriented magazine VOICE OF ASTARA -- May, 1982),
tells of a discovery she and researcher Bill Cox were shown during their
tour of Egypt. Their tour guides confided to the two mystics their
knowledge of two tunnels, neither of which had been fully explored. One was
in the temple of Edfu between Luxor and Cairo in the ruins of El Tuna
Gabel; and the other near Zozer's Step Pyramid at Cairo near
Memphis-Saqqarah, within the tomb of the Bull, called 'Serapium'. The
Egyptian government reportedly sealed both tunnels because of fears of
certain archaeologists that the tunnels "lead too deeply down into the
depths of the earth," and because they found the earth to be "honeycombed
with passages leading off into other depths," and the possibility of
explorers becoming lost. If such labyrinths do exist, then it may explain
one story concerning strange men dressed like "ancient Egyptians" who have
been seen, according to witnesses, deep within unexplored tunnels below the
region of Cairo and the Great Pyramids.

This may also be a possible confirmation of an account which appeared in
NEVADA AERIAL RESEARCH'S "LEADING EDGE" Publication, to the effect that the
U.S.(?) Government secretly maintains a HUGE base within a cavern of
tremendous size (several miles in diameter) beneath the desert sands of
Egypt. Could this tie-in with the vague references to the subterranean
culture or cultures known as the 'Phoenix Empire' (according to "Commander
X", who alleged that representatives of this empire have been seen in the
deeper levels of the "Dulce" base); and the 'Gizeh' or 'Giza' People (a
subterranean cult of Illuminati-like Imperialists who, so the "Pleiadeans"
claim, are working with other power-groups in a covert attempt to take over
the governments of planet earth)?

Vaughn M. Greene, in a letter which appeared in issue No. 14 of Richard
Toronto's SHAVERTRON letter-zine, spoke of a possible 'entrance' to cavern
systems near the bottom of the elevator landing within the Hoover dam
facility near Las Vegas (not far from the Mojave Desert), which holds back
Lake Mead. Several people have reported unusual "alien" encounters near
this reservoir. Early construction workers allegedly broke into (and
probably re-sealed) large caverns while blasting out the cliffs near the
base of the dam. In the lower elevator landing, according to Mr. Greene,
there was a "wild tile inlay on the floor, with signs of the zodiac and all
sorts of stuff suggesting an entrance." He suggests a possible connection
between this and the caverns which the workers reportedly broke into. Could
this tie-in with similar accounts given by others that an underground base
exists beneath Page, Arizona?

This underground facility is believed by several sources to connect the S-4
underground base in Nevada to the Dulce underground base in New Mexico via
tube-line? The Glen Canyon -- Lake Powell Hydroelectric dam in Page 'might'
provide a power source for such an underground installation, and is the
most likely area in or around Page for an 'entrance' (a deep gorge several
hundred feet deep leading into the Grand Canyon, a large government
facility, a hydroelectric power source, etc.). This is however only
supposition. It is said that Navaho dam, by the way, is a major
power-source that supplies a considerable percentage of electricity for the
upper human-occupied levels of the Dulce Base. This may suggest that other
similar bases are at least partially powered by hydroelectric dams.

Paxson C. Hayes, in writings of his which appeared in early issues of
BSRF's (Borderland Sciences Research Foundation's) publication 'ROUND
ROBIN,' referred to the discovery (one which he claimed to have made
himself) of the mummified remains of a race of 7-ft. tall humans who lived
in huge caverns 9,000 feet below the surface of North America.

Dana Howard, in her book, 'VESTA, THE EARTHBORN VENUSIAN' (Essene Press.,
Corpus Christi, TX. 1950), includes a chapter in her book which tells of a
remnant of an ancient race or human civilization still in existence
underground. These hidden people are said to reside within one of the
mountain ranges adjacent to the Imperial Valley area on the outskirts of
the Mojave Desert of California.

John A. Keel, on p. 145 of his book 'THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES' (Signet
Books., N.Y., 1975.), states: "An engineer, Rex Ball, swears he came upon a
mysterious underground installation in Georgia in 1940, manned by small
Oriental-looking men in coveralls and a few American military officers.
When he was caught in the tunnels, one of the officers issued the curt
command, 'Make him look like a nut!' He woke up in a field, uncertain
whether his experience had been real or a dream. That seems to be the
battle cry of the phenomena. 'Make him look like a nut!'" And on p. 192 of
the same book:

     "...A man on Long Island (informed Keel that he) was frantically
     making preparations for the big evacuation. He even traveled to a
     secret underground flying saucer base, in a black Cadillac with a
     dashboard festooned with flashing colored lights, where he
     participated in a 'dry run.' Other normal human beings were
     present, he said, and manned various kinds of equipment to
     communicate with the rescue spaceships somewhere overhead. 'Funny
     thing, John,' he mused, 'all the equipment was manufactured by
     Western Electric, Hallicrafters, and other U.S. companies.'"

Tal LeVesque, in an article titled 'UNDERGROUND UFO BASE SUSPECTED BY
OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON', which appeared in the Vol. 2., No. 2., issue of
THE HOLLOW HASSLE, described a suspected UFO Base which is believed by some
to lie under the Yakima Indian Reservation southeast of Tacoma, Washington.

The book 'THE LIFE OF THE CAVE', by Mohr and Paulson (1966), gives evidence
of extended animal migration underground beneath the central-eastern U.S.,
indicated by troglodytes (cave-dwelling animals) found in widely separated
caves which are identical with each other, indicating past
inter-connections which have become blocked. These caverns are found from
time to time during deep drilling operations.

A researcher by the name of Jon Singer, stated the following in an article
of his which appeared in 'THE MISSING LINK' newsletter: "Our nation's
capital has it's share of Fortean mysteries. There is supposed to be a
tunnel complex under the Octagon House at 1741 New York Avenue, NW. Dr.
John Thornton, the architect who designed the Capitol Building, built some
(but not all) of the tunnels. The course of at least two of the tunnels is
known. One is supposed to go to the White House and the other supposedly
leads to the Potomac. The tunnels are supposedly blocked up. Jim Brandon,
on p. 58 of (his book) 'WEIRD AMERICA' (1978. E.P. Dutton & Co., N.Y.),
added that the tunnels built by Dr. Thornton were only part of a much older
and larger tunnel network constructed by colonists from Atlantis.
Unfortunately his sources were two unidentified psychics, so this must be a
fascinating rumor." (Note: This would depend upon whether these
"revelations" were received by these psychics via entirely metaphysical or
"occultic" means, in which case they should be viewed with great suspicion,
or whether they based their claims on actual physical accounts).

However, Richard Toronto, editor of SHAVERTRON, claimed that some years ago
as a result of a printed request for information on subterranean anomalies,
a scientist contacted him offering a 10-page report on a system of tunnels
he had personally investigated beneath Washington D.C. He stated that the
tunnels were built by a very ancient race, and that the walls consisted of
a diamond-hard, glassy or glaze-like substance (similar to other deep
tunnels that have been described as existing beneath the surface of
northern Arkansas and elsewhere). As far as we know, Mr. Toronto never did
actually get his hands on the report.

Brad Steiger, in his book 'STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES' (Lancer Books., N.Y.
1972) related the following (MIB-related?) incident:

     "...at sundown on February 12, 1953, witnesses told police that
     they had watched an automobile enter the throat of a storm drain
     near Willowbrook and Greenleaf Avenues in Los Angeles. Officers
     arrived on the scene within ten minutes, and according to the Los
     Angeles HERALD AND EXPRESS, they followed the fresh tire-tread
     marks into the tunnel for seven miles. Other policemen and flood
     control district workers continued the search for the automobile
     by dropping through manhole covers.

     "The trackdown continued until midnight when, seven miles up the
     storm drain, THE TRACKS VANISHED. 'HERALD AND EXPRESS' newsmen
     who had accompanied the police on the incredible search up the
     tube were witnesses to the fact that: 'In the muddy silt covering
     the floor of the drain, the tire-tread marks were sharp and
     fresh. Then no more tracks.'"

Steven Brodie was a man of many talents and hobbies, among them painting
and rock collecting. Several years back he decided to investigate a certain
area in Arizona where, he had heard, quartz crystals could be found in
abundance. Brodie convinced a friend of his, also an avid rock collector,
to join him on a rock-hunting expedition to the site. After purchasing a
ticket on a passenger train, they traveled to a certain small community in
Arizona, which was near the area that they desired to explore.

According to researcher John J. Robinson, who related the account as he
heard it from Steve Brodie, the name of the Arizona town was not given.
John J. Robinson, by the way, was a well-known UFOlogist in the 1950's, and
the account as it was related to him was discussed by Robinson during an
interview which was heard by tens of thousands of listeners to the 'Long
John Nebel' radio talk-show on station W.O.R. of New York, in March of
1957.

The two rock hounds had their eyes on one particular bluff, which they
could see in the distance from the town they were in. Other town residents
heard about their plans and warned them against going to that bluff,
stating that SEVERAL people had in the past disappeared without a trace in
that area. Brodie and his friend blew-off their warnings, considering them
mere superstitions which they should not take seriously, and set out
towards the forbidden bluff. They had no sooner approached the base of the
bluff than out of the shadows emerged two beings who were each cowled in a
dark cloak and hood, making it very difficult to discern their features or
whether they were even human or not. After being confronted, Brodie's
friend panicked and attempted to make a run for it. Steve swore that at
this point one of the black cloaked figures raised some kind of weapon and
a brilliant pencil beam of light shot from it and hit his friend, who cried
out in agony and immediately fell down motionless. From what Brodie could
gather his friend had been killed, although he never did see his body after
that.

Following this, one of the 'beings' came up to Brodie, who did not resist
but stood where he was. While still in a state of shock, one of the
creatures placed some type of device over his head, like a metal headset
with two metallic 'discs' which fitted over his temples. At this point he
started to lose consciousness.

The next thing Steve remembered after gaining consciousness again was of
being in some type of dungeon or cavern-like enclosure, within a
prison-like cell. Other humans were there as well. Most of the people there
seemed to be under some type of trance or mind control, and as far as he
knew, he was one of them. He dimly recalls 'waking up' a few times, but
usually when this happened one of the dark-robed creatures would come over
to the cage or enclosure where he was and point a rod-shaped device at him,
at which point he would black out again. During one of his brief conscious
episodes, he had a chance to talk to another prisoner, a girl, who told him
that their dark-robed captors were known as the 'dero'.

That, basically, was all that he remembered. The incredible part of the
story, however, was the fact that several months afterwards he suddenly
'came to' and found himself conscious once again. He suddenly realized that
he was walking down the streets of New York City! He had no idea how he got
there, or where he had been the past six months. It was like 'waking up'
out of a bad dream or nightmare, the majority of which he could not
remember. In addition to this, he found that someone had given him a
haircut (he didn't know whom).

Whether or not this account has any connection to the many 'rumors' of
strange and ancient caverns and tunnels below New York City is uncertain.
Some cautiously speak of such tunnels as being used by a MIB-like secret
society, some of these tunnels connecting with the lowest sub-basements of
the Empire State building and other Manhattan structures. Some allege that
such tunnels are the possible destination of many of those who mysteriously
end up 'missing' in New York City every year. Whether these are mere
unfounded 'rumors' is anyone's guess, at least until solid evidence
'surfaces' to prove such accounts.

John J. Robinson made several visits to Mr. Brodie, and from his
perceptions of the men he felt that Brodie was sincere in what he was
saying, but Steve was constantly paranoid and in fear that he was 'being
followed' or that someone or something was constantly watching or stalking
him. Also, Steve Brodie would often paint bizarre other-worldly landscapes,
even though he wasn't used to painting in that style until after his
'experience', which Robinson thought peculiar. Then one day Robinson
stopped by Brodie's apartment to pay him a visit and he was no where to be
found. No one seemed to know what happened to him, and that was the last
time Mr. Robinson ever saw Steve again.

The 'Steve Brodie' account, incidentally, was also related in an article in
the Vol. 1, No. 3, 1971 issue of 'STRANGE' magazine, and also in early
issues of 'SAUCER NEWS', of which John J. Robinson -- who lived in Jersey
City, New Jersey at the time -- was assistant editor.

In his book 'ON THE SHORES OF ENDLESS WORLDS' (Souvenir Press), Andrew
Tomas, in his chapter "Labyrinths and Serpents", states: "...According to
legend, King Minos of Crete ordered his architect Daedalus to construct the
labyrinth, a maze of passages so ingeniously devised that even the builder
himself could not find his way without a plan. In the centre lived the
Minotaur, half bull, half human, to whom the Greeks sent seven youths and
seven maidens as a tribute every nine years. The Minotaur was slain by
Theseus who was able to find his way out of the labyrinth thanks to a ball
of thread given to him by Ariadne. This myth has been interpreted as an
historical record of the construction of the palace of Minos in Knossos
which contains innumerable galleries and rooms. On the other hand, this
myth may have an entirely different interpretation, similar to a
cryptogram, which conceals the existence of a secret repository of
underground chambers and passages..."

Although this might seem to be just a 'legend', there are actual accounts
of alleged encounters with paraphysical (part supernatural, part physical)
'demoniacal' creatures such as the satyrs, centaurs, and Minotaurs, etc.,
which have been described in Greek mythology. Such encounters often involve
paraphysical "poltergeist-like" phenomena and manipulation of mind and
matter. According to some sources, a race of beings possessing a
combination of humanoid, angelic and animal-like character- istics
pre-dated Adamic civilization and were involved in the original rebellion
and conspiracy against the Creator (other 'mythical' beings such as
mer-people, unicorns, fairies and such were also traditionally involved in
the fall. Like the angels them- selves, some of them were deceived by the
followers of Lucifer whereas others escaped the fall and remained true to
the Creator). The creatures mentioned in the 9th chapter of the book of
Revelation 'may' be this type of demonic or fallen entity. These creatures
were apparently distinct from the purely spiritual angelic and
fallen-angelic beings. Whether the following account describes an encounter
with such a fallen race(s) remains to be seen. The letter we quote here
appeared in the Winter, 1962 issue of THE HIDDEN WORLD, one of several
publications which grew out of the "Shaver Mystery" controversy of the late
1940's:

     "Mr. Richard Shaver: Hoping this letter finds you in the best of
     health. My name is Frank J. Mezta. I live in the County of
     Imperial Valley, City of Calexico, California.

     "Through accident I happened to stumble into your book HIDDEN
     WORLD issue No. A-1 and just recently A-2. I sometimes wonder if
     it was luck or deliberate action on the part of a tero. All my
     life, I have been looking and asking for certain, unsolved and
     unanswered questions regarding civilization, our ancestors and
     the beginning of time. I believe your book gave me the best
     answers. Let me tell you a few of my expeditions.

     "Two years ago, we went treasure hunting in the interior of
     Mexico, which turned out to be a flop. But in that excursion some
     strange things happened to us, which at the time we wrote off as
     superstition. We went to this place where we were supposed to
     enter; but suddenly a fright with chills came over me, something
     I had never felt before. Something like a sixth sense, like if I
     knew something was going to happen to me. I didn't go in and
     neither did anybody else. Next day we approached the cave again,
     only this time I wasn't afraid and I let the group inside. This
     cave was tremendous in size, and leading passages everywhere.
     Some of these passages or chambers, sometimes being 30 ft. high
     and 100 ft. long (contained) connecting tunnels. We finally gave
     up, but in retrieving we found two leading passages instead of
     the one we had entered. This startled us, and we set to
     investigate the second tunnel. It just kept winding and going
     down so we finally gave up and got out of there.

     "When we got back to the village we struck a conversation with
     two Mexican Indians, and they told us that whatever we did, not
     to go into the enchanted caves. We got curious and asked them
     where these so called enchanted caves were. They gave us
     directions and that was exactly where we had entered a few days
     ago. We asked them what happened in these caves. They told us
     that people that went in there, never came out, that while in
     there, the entrances and tunnels would change, which happened to
     us, and we didn't know about this till after we had been in
     there. Then they told us the strangest thing, which at the time
     we said these people are superstitious. They said that they went
     with an expedition with 20 or 30 men hired by an American man to
     look into this cave. This happened about 10 or 15 years ago they
     said. Four or five of the men had revolvers, they were well
     equipped with lights and tools. While they were working there all
     of a sudden in the far end there appeared a half man and bull
     head like a bull upright. This description fits the one you have
     on your front cover on issue A-1. And next to him was a naked
     midget or little boy. They pulled out their revolvers but they
     wouldn't fire, and their lights went out. There was confusion,
     and several men were killed in the scramble and nobody returned
     after that -- Frank J. Mezta, 939 Genge, Calexico, Calif."

David Perkins, in a letter of his which appeared in the Vol. 1, No. 1 issue
of 'THE HOLLOW HASSLE', told of a strange "breathing well" that drillers
had broken into 17 miles east of Walsenberg, CO. Other strange occurrences
had been found on the ranch or farm where the well was located, including
unexplained cattle mutilations. Representatives from the Colorado School of
Mines came out to investigate the well, which seemed to 'breath' in and out
with the rising and falling of the tides, and they excitedly suggested that
a tunnel lay below which may have connected with a similar tunnel which the
Colorado School of Mines had tracked from the Gulf of Mexico and as far as
Oklahoma. A 'possible' connection to this: one source alleged that an
'alternative 002' type of underground 'city' maintained by a secret
society, can be entered via a 'lodge' in the Uncompagre Mts., also in
southwest Colorado. Also, a large "Masonic Park" exists in this same area
(any connection?).

Morris K. Jessup's "THE CASE FOR THE UFO -- ANNOTATED EDITION" (a classic
collectors item republished by Gray Barker in a limited edition) was FIRST
'reprinted' by the VARO Corp. of Texas. This was an electronics firm which
was commissioned to print the book specifically for the Navy. The original
'CASE FOR THE UFO', written by UFOlogist Morris K. Jessup, was not too
revealing in itself but was merely a collection of theories and documented
sightings of UFOs just like other books which were making the rounds. The
interesting thing however is that Jessup was approached by Naval Officials
and shown an ANNOTATED copy of his own book which had been sent to them by
persons unknown. Later a 'Carlos Allende', apparently one of three
mysterious informants, contacted Jessup, insinuating that he and the three
other annotators were representatives of an ancient hi-tech earth-based
society of possible "gypsy" heritage. The notations and comments were
apparently based on the secret knowledge of their race.

They spoke of force fields, aerial ships, forces working in the Bermuda
Triangle, ancient nuclear war on earth, diamond crystals, and many other
subjects of a highly technical nature. What caught the Navy's interest
however were references to the so-called 'Philadelphia Experiment', a Navy
project which has been confirmed by others that involved an attempt to make
a destroyer, the 'U.S.S. ELDRIDGE', invisible optically as well as to
radar. An intense electromagnetic field was allegedly generated and the
ship did go invisible to the point that it's water-line could be seen in
the water -- minus the ship itself.

But then something happened, a brilliant blue flash was observed and the
men on the ship were thrown into chaos. Apparently the experiment in it's
attempt to make a ship invisible had broken through the electromagnetic
barrier between two worlds and loosed a whole pandora's box of unknown
forces. What happened from that point on has been debated. Some of these
reported side effects included:

     * The appearance of Greenish fogs similar to those observed in
     the Bermuda Triangle; nicknamed the 'molasses' or the 'push'.

     * In some cases the death of servicemen who became caught up in
     possible underlying electrical currents which set their bodies on
     fire in a type of spontaneous human combustion.

     * The permanent disappearance of servicemen during and after the
     experiments into a parallel time-space reality.

     * The induced invisibility, time freezing, or teleporting of Navy
     workers and at least one ship at the Philadelphia Shipyard.

     * Workers in the 'Experiment' state that a horrifying side effect
     involved the tendency of workers to phase-out into another
     parallel time-space existence wherein they might be able to
     observe our 'world' yet would be invisible and intangible,
     "phantoms" who are neither alive or dead as we know it. Some
     reports included a jet pilot involved in the original experiment
     who just 'disappeared' from the cockpit his aircraft, causing the
     death of a passenger; A man who 'walked through a wall' in the
     sight of his family and was never seen again; A group of men
     involved in the experiment who 'disappeared' into and out of a
     greenish fog during a bar room brawl to the consternation of
     their opponents; And at least one man (who was presumed to have
     died or disappeared in one of the experiments) who would 'appear
     out of nowhere' at his mother's home, crying and asking for food,
     etc.

     * In at least one case there was the 'recovery' of crewmen who
     were caught in a TIME FREEZE for several decades, only to be
     pulled from an alternate 'timeflow' by none other than Dr. John
     Von Neumann and his associates. Actual non-paradoxical "time
     travel" (the only kind that reportedly exists or can exist) may
     have been involved in this recovery.

The Experiments were reportedly assisted by Nikola Tesla, Dr. Von Neumann,
T. Townsend Brown, Edward Cameron, John Hutchinson, Dr. Emil Kurtenauer and
other top scientists, utilizing Einsteinian theory. However Tesla
reportedly sabotaged one of the first experiments after being convinced it
would be harmful to the humans involved. Rumor had it that Tesla was in
contact with extraterrestrials (Pleiadeans operating from the Red Planet,
Mars), and that UFO's were involved with the experiment in some way,
attempting to guide the experiments in an advisory capacity via their
contacts with Nikola Tesla. Tesla allegedly quit the project over the fact
that too many servicemen were being 'sacrificed' by well-meaning
Nazi-phobes who were insistent on developing the technology to aid the War
Effort before the Germans could gain the upper hand in the War. The UFO
occupants in contact with Tesla allegedly warned of the dangers, however
many these warnings went unheeded by Navy Intelligence...

(Note: 40 years later the project was reportedly taken over and continued
by a cabal of CIA agents in league with the Bavarian Illuminati of Germany,
and it's fellow occult lodge, the Bavarian Thule Society which had created
the Nazi Empire. These experiments were carried out in an underground base
below Montauk Point, Long Island, and involved time-space window
experiments and mass microwave mind-control. However, by that time the
Pleiadeans were out of the picture all-together, since these fascists who
had wrested control of the 'Philadelphia' technology from Navy Intelligence
were at that time in full cooperation with the alien Grays in a joint
effort to establish a one- world National Socialist Empire. This war
between Navy and Nazi intelligence went "underground" after the Allied
Invasion of Germany. There are allegations that Navy Admiral Richard E.
Byrd and 4,000 elite Navy forces even made a secret attempt to destroy a
super-secret underground Nazi stronghold in Antarctica code-named "New
Berlin". This massive base was reportedly inhabited by over 2,000 Nazi-S.S.
scientists, and nearly 1,000,000 lay Nazis [and slave-workers from the
concentration camps], all of whom had mysteriously disappeared from Germany
throughout the course of the war. This secret war is said to continue today
within the Nevada Military complex between Navy Intelligence's "COM-12" who
maintain contact with the Pleiadeans, and the CIA-Thule Society's
"AQUARIUS" cult which has maintained ties with the reptilian Grays that may
date back before the beginning of World War II - Branton)

As for M.K. Jessup, who was the recipient of several of the "Allende"
revelations, the Philadelphia Experiment was described in even more detail
within the letters that he recieved from the mysterious Carl Allen, or
"Carlos Allende" (could Allende's contemporaries have been tied-in with the
UFO's that allegedly guided the experiments?). Jessup continued in his
investigation of the Philadelphia Experiment or 'Project Rainbow'. At one
point he informed a research associate that he had some startling
revelations, and that he would bring the information over to him
personally. Jessup left to deliver the revelations, but he never arrived at
his friends house. It is almost as if some dark organization was intent on
preventing these revelations, whatever they were, from reaching the public.

Jessup was found suffocated to death in his car, near a park, the result of
carbon monoxide poisoning via a hose which was attached to his tailpipe and
run into the car. It was said that when he was found, Jessup was still
barely alive. However there were no reports of any attempts to save his
life. In fact, the research documents containing the "revelations" never
turned up, and Jessup took his secret with him to the grave. The
"authorities" who "responded" to his death seem to be at least partially
implicated. There is also the strong possibility that Jessup's death was
"fixed" to look like a suicide. The mystery has not yet been solved.

John Keel, in his book 'OUR HAUNTED PLANET' (1968., Fawcett., Greenwich,
Conn.) pp. 113-114, relates the following:

"...Another group of CIA-baiting researchers is now over- lapping into
ufology. They are the comparatively small teams of amateur sleuths
dedicated to investigating the assassination of President Kennedy. Here the
black Cadillacs and the slight, dark men in black suits are viewed as
Cubans and CIA agents. Paranoia runs high because now over fifty witnesses
-- as of 1968 --, reporters, and assassination investigators have met with
sudden death, under the most suspicious circumstances. The full story of
Kennedy's murder in Dallas in 1963 is filled with incredible details, many
of them similar to things found in the most mysterious of the UFO
incidents. Photos and physical evidence have vanished or been tampered with
just as in so many UFO cases. A wide assortment of mystery men have been
involved, including DOPPELGANGERS of the late Lee Harvey Oswald -- see
Richard Popkin's 'THE SECOND OSWALD'. This other Oswald even turned up at a
public rifle range before the assassination, making a nuisance of himself
(so the witnesses would be sure to remember him?), he FIRED AN UNUSUAL GUN
WHICH SPAT OUT BALLS OF FIRE AT THE TARGET. He also visited an automobile
showroom and went for a demonstration ride in a new car. The real Oswald
could not drive. His whereabouts at the time of these incidents are
known... and he was nowhere near the rifle range and auto agency. The huge
WARREN REPORT contains numerous pieces of sworn testimony describing
MIB-type men in the vicinity of Dealey Plaza and the School Book Depository
building immediately before and after the assassination. Long-haired men
were seen. This may not sound extraordinary, but remember that long hair
was most unusual in 1963. The Beatles did not begin to make an impression
until 1964, and the long-hair fad did not get underway until 1965-66..."

Researcher Val Valarian in the early 1990's investigated the experiences of
a woman who claimed abductions on numerous occasions near Mt. Lassen,
California (see: LEADING EDGE Magazine, June 1992 issue). Her 'abductors',
she claimed, were humans of a generally unsympathetic and manipulating
nature who were working with the reptilian 'grays'. During her encounter
she saw the typical grays, a larger 'gray' with orange-red eyes and
vertical-slit pupils, and of course the humans themselves. At one point a
'woman' took off a helmet in front of her, which seemed to be used to cover
her features. Immediately someone from another room began cursing and told
her to put the helmet back on.

This abductee also referred to a 'head-doctor' who implemented a type of
'induced psychosis' (split personality?) on her through some type of
techno-hypnotic manipulation.

Mt. Lassen has been described by others as being a 'doorway to another
world', and according to early contributors to Ray Palmer's AMAZING STORIES
magazine during the 'Shaverian' era, strange voices have been heard there,
and even rocks from the size of pebbles to basketball-size have
mysteriously showered down on people who have approached certain areas of
the mountain, and this without any outward sign of volcanic activity from
the mountain itself.

Some years ago a man by the name of Ralph B. Fields submitted an account to
AMAZING STORIES Magazine (Dec. 1946 issue, pp. 155-157), with the assurance
that it was true and actually happened. He and a friend of his who lived at
the base of Mt. Lassen in California stated that they had read an article
in a magazine telling of the unusual quality of bat guano as a fertilizer,
and that it was a very valuable resource. Hoping to make a quick buck, they
decided to climb the mountain in search of caverns which might contain the
valuable fertilizer.

On about the third day of their journey they discovered behind an
outcropping of rock a small entrance to a cave, at about the 7000 ft.
level. They immediately chose to explore, and soon found that the passage
widened considerably. They noticed that the walls seemed to be smooth and
glazed, as if the rock had been fused by intense heat in some ancient time.

They continued deeper until to their horror they saw a light up ahead of
them. Shortly after this they were confronted with five 'normal' looking
men wearing the usual surface attire that was common at the time, flannel
shirts, etc. These strangers asked the two young men what they were doing,
and when they explained about the 'guano' they had the impression that the
'men' did not believe them. One of them, appearing to be in his mid- 50's,
said 'I think you had better come with us.' They were then taken to a large
machine or contrivance nearby which appeared to be sled-like, with a
copper-colored metal-like sheet covering its underside. It also seemed to
hover perpetually a few inches above the ground. At that point they were
taken onto the 'sled' (which they later learned was constructed, along with
the tunnel itself, by an ancient and possibly antediluvian race, and was
based on a 'carbon' and possibly electromagnetic propulsion system.) The
'sled' could reach great speeds and seemed to follow a metal 'strip' that
ran along the center of the underground 'road'.

As if this were not enough, they were surprised once again when another
'light' quickly approached from the distance, a similar vehicle. Eventually
the other 'sled' as well as the one they were on slowed and came to a stop
only a few yards from each other. Their captors fled in terror while the
two explorers remained on the sled, confused at this strange drama being
played out before them. They noticed a brilliant pencil-beam of light which
shot forth from the 'other' sled and caught the fleeing men in their path.

These new arrivals soon made it known to Ralph Fields and his friend that
the men who had taken them captive were the 'horlocks'. They made it known
that it was fortunate that 'they' had come this way, otherwise "you would
have become horlocks yourselves, and we would have had to kill you also."

Just what a 'horlock' was they did not specify, but in connection with
other accounts, they may have been mind-altered human pawns of a malevolent
race, possibly even the serpent race (or Grays) if we consider later
reports of collaboration between humans and reptilians near Mt. Lassen.

These 'men' did not explain much, other than the fact that there were many
evil persons in the underground 'world' who have caused 'them' as well as
those on the surface considerable harm. One of the men stated that such men
were 'safe' because the outside world generally did not believe that they
or their world existed. The dilemma of these new arrivals however, was that
they felt compelled to keep the knowledge of certain of the 'ancient'
technologies that had been discovered in the caverns (and much of the
operation of which still remained unexplained even to these cavern
dwellers) away from those on the surface, otherwise we might be inclined to
destroy ourselves with these technological forces that we know very little
about, based on our past experience of twisting scientific discoveries into
weapons of destruction.

Fields and his friend were allowed to return to the surface, but were
warned never again to enter the caves.

The above account seems to tie-in with yet another report which involved a
group of speleonauts who entered one of several caverns west or northwest
of Cushman, Arkansas.

These explorers claimed to have descended 5 to 6 miles (over a period of
several consecutive explorations) into deep and extensive cavern systems.
At one point they claimed to have broken into a glazed 'tunnel' of apparent
human construction which was lined with metal-hard yet transparent tunnel
walls. Through these transparent tunnel walls they were able to
occasionally observe a whole "hadean" like world of bizarre subterranean
creatures, including hairy humanoids who appeared to be in conflict with a
race of oversized serpents or snakes, and even giant insects, cavern moths,
and so on.

The most interesting part of their expedition, which was recorded in THE
HOLLOW HASSLE Newsletter -- formerly edited by TAL LeVesque and Mary Davis,
was their alleged encounter with a race of humans approximately 8 ft. tall
with pale blue skin. These people were similar in description to a certain
group of 'aliens' referred to by John Lear and others which were reportedly
encountered by certain astronauts on the moon -- a 'top secret' which the
government may never admit to. The cavers described them as about 7-8 ft.
tall and possessing large 'wrap-around' eyes, but nevertheless 'human' in
every other respect.

The explorers insisted that they were 'led' to an underground city via a
type of hidden elevator, and were even shown deeper caverns of immense size
in which could be seen ancient repositories left there by a highly-advanced
(scientifically) antediluvian race, some of the contents of which, they
were told, remained sealed to that day! This may have been the same ancient
culture which LEFT the machines that were described in the Ralph Fields
account.

The explorers were told, via a type of translating device, that the
inhabitants of this particular cavern city were descended from a family
that in our own traditions would correspond to the Biblical description of
the family of 'Noah'; that they had a 'Book of Laws' somewhat similar to
our Bible; and that they had come to the Western Hemisphere thousands of
years previous and discovered this already-existing subterranean 'world'.
They also stated that some of their ancestors had left the earth to explore
the other planets and stars long ago.

Whether the following item has any connection with the people allegedly
encountered by these speleologists is uncertain. The following was related
by John Keel in his book 'THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES':

     "...The Cherokees have a tradition, according to Benjamin Smith
     Barton's 'NEW VIEWS OF THE ORIGINS OF THE TRIBES AND NATIONS OF
     AMERICA' (1798), that when they migrated to Tennessee they found
     the region inhabited by a weird race of white people who lived in
     houses and were apparently quite civilized. They had one problem:
     their eyes were very large and sensitive to light. They could
     only see at night..."

Is it possible that these people may have later taken up a cave-dwelling
lifestyle, if they had not done so previously, to allow themselves more
comfortable living conditions?

The many caverns west of Cushman, Arkansas have given rise to many strange
legends and stories. There are accounts of vast underground mazes,
underground lakes, caves which lead to extremely deep pockets of stagnant
air or poison gas, areas where electrical lights will not work, stories of
people entering caves and never being seen again, and even accounts of
hairy humanoids throwing boulders at intruders, intentionally missing them
so as to scare them away. In essence it is a place which, if Jules Verne
had known about it when writing his famous 'A JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE
EARTH', might have been the inspiration behind his novel of a daring
descent into the underground world.

Lt. Col. Wendelle C. Stevens, in his book, "UFO - CONTACT FROM THE
PLEIADES, A PRELIMINARY REPORT" (UFO Photo Archives., Tucson, AZ 1982., p.
79) reports on the alleged sixth face-to-face contact between Eduard
'Billy' Meier and the 'Pleiadean' Semjase. He was told of strange people,
unknown to us, who live in the interior of mountains and cave's beneath the
earth's surface. They are of various types, some with bluish skin, and
others who often come to the surface and blend with surface inhabitants,
unknown as to their true origin.

Ferdinand Ossendowski describes what may be one of the most widely accepted
'legends' in Asia, one which is in fact accepted by millions of people.
This legend is described in his book 'BEASTS, MEN AND GODS' (1922. E.P.
Dutton & Co., N.Y.). Quoting from the chapter 'THE SUBTERRANEAN KINGDOM'
(pp. 300-311) we read:

     "...On my journey into Central Asia I came to know for the first
     time about the 'Mystery of Mysteries,' which I can call by no
     other name. At the outset I did not pay much attention to it and
     did not attach to it such importance as I afterwards realized
     belonged to it, when I had analyzed and connected many sporadic,
     hazy and often controversial bits of evidence.

     "The old people on the shore of the river Amyl related to me an
     ancient legend to the effect that a certain Mongolian tribe, in
     their escape from the demands of Genghis Khan, hid themselves in
     a subterranean country. Afterwards a Soyot from near the Lake of
     Nogan Kul showed me the smoking gate that serves as the entrance
     to the 'Kingdom of Agharti.' Through this gate a hunter formerly
     entered into the Kingdom and, after his return, began to relate
     what he had seen there. The Lamas cut out his tongue in order to
     prevent him from telling about the Mystery of Mysteries. When he
     arrived at old age, he came back to the entrance of this cave and
     disappeared into the subterranean kingdom, the memory of which
     had ornamented and lightened his nomad heart.

     "...The favorite Gelong Lama of Prince Chultun Beyli and the
     Prince himself gave me an account of the subterranean kingdom.

     "'Everything in the world,' said the Gelong, 'is constantly in a
     state of change and transition -- peoples, science, religions,
     laws and customs. How many great empires and brilliant cultures
     have perished! And that alone which remains unchanged is Evil,
     the tool of Bad Spirits. More than 60,000 years ago a holyman
     disappeared with a whole tribe of people under the ground and
     never appeared again on the surface of the earth. Many people,
     however, have since visited this kingdom, Sakkia Mouni, Undur
     Gheghen, Paspa, Khan Baber and others. No one knows where this
     place is. One says Afghanistan, others India. All the people
     there are protected against Evil and crimes do not exist within
     its bourns. Science has there developed calmly and nothing is
     threatened with destruction. The subterranean people have reached
     the highest knowledge..." (Note: The 60,000 year period is
     probably greatly exaggerated. There have apparently been several
     migrations of surface tribes over the millennia and centuries
     into what might be referred to as this subterranean 'continent'
     of AGHARTA. According to an American 'monk' by the name of Ernest
     Dickhoff, as described in his book AGHARTA [Health Research, CA],
     some of the human inhabitants of this realm had established
     themselves as residents only within the last few centuries. This
     took place when an Asian Prince entered with an army of 400
     followers and fought with and drove out a race of 'Reptilians' or
     serpent-men who had taken possession of these caverns. This
     invasion was initiated after it was found that these serpent
     beings were using black witchcraft to manipulate the minds and
     spirits of humans on the surface in a very negative way.
     According to one source, over 20,000,000 persons of various
     different tribes and cultures now reside in Agharti, and many
     more millions on the surface in Asia accept the existence of such
     a mysterious realm, according to writers such as Ferdinand
     Ossendowski, Nicholas Roerich, and others. It is said that
     ancient 'library' temples exists between the surface of Asia AND
     Agharti, in underground vaults to which certain Asian 'initiates'
     have access. Below or beyond these vaults, through hidden
     passages, the kingdom itself is believed to exist. - Branton)

     "Prince Chultun Beyli added: 'This kingdom is Agharti. It extends
     throughout all the subterranean passages of the whole world. I
     heard a learned Lama of China relating to Bogdo Khan that all the
     subterranean caves of America are inhabited by the ancient people
     who have disappeared underground. Traces of them are still found
     on the surface of the land. These subterra- nean peoples and
     spaces are governed by rulers owing allegiance to the King of the
     World...'"

     (Note: If the subterranea of America was once MOSTLY inhabited by
     humans who migrated there from the surface or other parts of the
     inner world, then the fact of the MODERN DAY infiltration of the
     saurian or serpent races [of which the Grays apparently make up
     the majority] into the underground of America must suggest that
     the major infestation occurred sometime within the last few
     centuries. The so-named 'King of the World' is apparently a
     reference to the present of a long succession of leaders over the
     council of Agharti, which would probably make whoever held such a
     position one of the most influential men in the world, for good
     or evil. And in fact, according to former Dulce Base security
     worker Thomas Castello, certain of the U.S. Presidents in the
     past have not only held conferences with the ruling council in
     'Telos', but also with these kings of 'Agharti'. Telos, the
     colony below Mt. Shasta, is reportedly a western branch of the
     Agharti Federation. A succession of many such 'kings' have
     allegedly reigned over this underground realm, most of them
     probably receiving more adoration than they deserve, having
     apparently been regarded as 'gods' by some of the residents of
     the subterranean world, if the "King of the World" appellation is
     any indication. This would not necessarily be the fault of these
     'kings' or leaders, many of whom according to sources HAVE
     acknowledged a higher potentate than themselves and prayed to
     Almighty 'God' on behalf of humanity. Just like the Popes of Rome
     or Rulers, Secretary Generals, Prime Ministers and Presidents of
     the surface nations, these Agharian 'kings' possessed their own
     personalities, some being perhaps more suited to reign than
     others. Nevertheless they should be respected as the elected or
     chosen representatives or spokes- persons for perhaps tens of
     millions of persons who dwell within the inner world. The name of
     one such king, according to one source, was 'Rigdon Jyepo'. At
     this writing the names of other Agharian rulers are unknown
     except, perhaps, to the inhabitants of Agharti or Agharta itself.
     - Branton)

     Prince Chultun, speaking to the author, continued: "'...In
     underground caves there exists a peculiar light which affords
     growth to the grains and vegetables and long life without disease
     to the people. There are many different peoples and many
     different tribes. An old Buddhist Brahman in Nepal was carrying
     out the will of the 'gods' in making a visit to the ancient
     kingdom of Genghis, -- Siam, -- where he met a fisherman who
     ordered him to take a place in his boat and sail with him upon
     the sea. On the third day they reached an island where he met a
     people having two tongues which could speak separately in
     different languages. They showed to him peculiar, unfamiliar
     animals, tortoises with sixteen feet and one eye, huge snakes
     with a very tasty flesh and birds with teeth which caught fish
     for their masters in the sea. These people told him that they had
     come up out of the subterranean kingdom and described to him
     certain parts of the underground country.'

     "The Lama Turgut traveling with me from Urga to Peking gave me
     further details.

     "'The capital of Agharti is surrounded with towns of high priests
     and scientists. It reminds one of Lhasa where the palace of the
     Dalai Lama, the Potala, is the top of a mountain covered with
     monasteries and temples.

     "'...In cars strange and unknown to us they rush through the
     narrow cleavages inside our planet. Some Indian Brahmans and
     Tibetan Dalai Lamas during their laborious struggles to the peaks
     of mountains which no other human feet had trod have found there
     inscriptions on the rocks, footprints in the snow and tracks of
     wheels. The blissful Sakkia Mouni found on one mountain top
     tablets of stone carrying words which he only understood in his
     old age and afterwards penetrated into the Kingdom of Agharti,
     from which he brought back crumbs of the sacred learning
     preserved in his memory.'"

     Ferdinand Ossendowski remembered a particular conversation with
     one Lama:

     "'How many persons have ever been to Agharti?' I questioned him.

     "'Very many,' answered the Lama, 'but all these people have kept
     secret that which they saw there.'"

In his book 'SHAMBHALA' (1930. Frederick A. Stokes Co., N.Y.), writer and
traveler Nicholas Roerich adds some additional insights into human
habitation of underground regions of central Asia. In his chapter
'SUBTERRANEAN DWELLERS' we read the following words:

     "...In the Altai Mountains, in the beautiful upland valley of
     Uimon, a hoary Old Believer (Starover) said to me: 'I shall prove
     to you that the tale about the Chud, the subterranean people, is
     not a fantasy! I shall lead you to the entrance of the
     subterranean kingdom.'

     "On the way through the valley surrounded by snowy mountains, my
     host told us many tales about the Chud. It is remarkable that
     'Chud' in Russian has the same origin as the word WONDER. So,
     perhaps, we may consider the Chud a wonderful tribe. My bearded
     guide told how 'once upon a time, in this fertile valley lived
     and flourished the powerful tribe of Chud. They knew how to
     prospect for minerals and how to reap the best harvest. Most
     peaceful and most industrious, was this tribe. But then came a
     White Tzar with innumerable hordes of cruel warriors. The
     peaceful, industrious Chud could not resist the assaults of the
     conquerors, and not wishing to lose their liberty, they remained
     as serfs to the White Tzar. Then, for the first time, a white
     birch began to grow in this region. And, according to old
     prophecies, the Chud knew that it was the time for their
     departure. And the Chud, unwilling to remain subject to the White
     Tzar, departed under the earth. Only sometimes can you hear the
     holy people singing; now their bells ring out in the subterranean
     temples. But there shall come the glorious time of human
     purification, and in those days, the great Chud shall again
     appear in full glory.'

     "Thus the Old Believer concluded. We approached some low stony
     hill. Proudly he showed me, 'Here we are. Here is the entrance to
     the great subterranean kingdom! When the Chud entered the
     subterranean passage they closed the entrance with stones. Now we
     stand just beside this holy entrance.'

     "We stood before a huge tomb encircled by great stones, so
     typical of the period of the great migrations. Such tombs, with
     the beautiful remains of Gothic relics, we saw in South Russian
     steppes, (and) in foothills of the Northern Caucasus. Studying
     this hill, I remembered how during our crossing of the Karakorum
     pass, my sais, the Ladaki, asked me, 'Do you know that in the
     subterranean caves here many treasures are hidden and that in
     them lives a wonderful tribe which abhors the sins of earth?'

     "And again when we approached Khotan the hoofs of our horses
     sounded hollow as though we rode above caves or hollows. Our
     caravan people called attention to this, saying, 'Do you hear
     what hollow subterranean passages we are crossing? Through these
     passages, people who are familiar with them can reach far- off
     countries.' When we saw entrances to caves, our caravaneers told
     us, 'Long ago people lived there; now they have gone inside; they
     have found a subterranean passage to the subterranean kingdom.
     Only rarely do some of them appear again on the earth. At our
     bazaar such people come with strange, very ancient money, but
     nobody could ever remember a time when such money was in usage
     here.' I asked them, if we could also see such people. And they
     answered, 'Yes, if your thoughts are similarly high and in
     contact with these holy people, because only sinners are upon the
     earth and the pure and courageous people pass on to something
     more beautiful.' (This is not to say that there are NOT
     subterranean areas where evil abounds, but that there are
     apparently protected areas where animosity between fellow human
     beings is greatly discouraged - Branton)

     "Great is the belief in the Kingdom of the subterranean people.
     Through all of Asia, through the spaces of all deserts, from the
     Pacific to the Urals, you can hear the same wondrous tale of the
     vanished holy people...

     (One such persistent tale is that of the "Lost Ten Tribes" of
     Israel. Residents of modern Israel claim descent from the tribes
     of Judah and Benjamin, and half of the tribe of Levi who remained
     behind following the great separation of Israel in the time of
     Solomon. The only "known" people who claim descent from other
     Israelite tribes are the so-called "Black Jews" of Ethiopia who
     insist that they are descended from the tribe of Dan. This leaves
     8 1/2 tribes unaccounted for -- or rather as some believe 9 1/2
     tribes, because in the Book of Revelation the two Josephite lines
     of Ephraim and Mannassah are considered as distinct tribes.
     INTERESTINGLY, the tribe of DAN does not appear in the book of
     REVELATION among the 144,000 priests, 12,000 from each of the 12
     restored tribes [this restoration has yet to take place],
     possibly because DAN was the tribe most responsible for leading
     Israel into Old Testament apostasy and idolatry. The only record
     of the missing 9 1/2 tribes appears in the 13th chapter of the
     book of II ESDRAS, one of the "apocryphal" books containing
     Jewish legend and tradition which were written in the 400-year
     non-prophetical period between the end of the Torahic or Old
     Testament and the beginning of the New Testement periods. This
     contains only a cryptic remark that the lost tribes entered an
     unknown land to the extreme north or northeast called ARZARETH,
     from where they will one day return in power - Branton)

     "Even far beyond the Ural Mountains, the echo of the same tale
     will reach you. Often you hear about subterranean tribes.
     Sometimes an invisible holy people is said to be living behind a
     mountain. Sometimes either poisonous or vitalizing gases are
     spread over the earth, to protect some one. Sometimes you hear
     how the sands of the great desert shift, and for a moment
     disclose treasures of the entrances of subterranean kingdoms. But
     none would dare to touch those treasures. You will hear how, in
     the rocks, in the most deserted mountain ranges, you can see
     openings which connect with these subterranean passes, and how
     beautiful princesses once upon a time occupied these natural
     castles.

     "From distances one might take these openings for eries, because
     all which belongs to the subterranean people is concealed.
     Sometimes the Holy City is submerged, as in the folk-lore of
     Netherlands and Switzerland. And there is folk-lore that
     coincides with actual discoveries in the lakes and along the sea
     coasts. In Siberia, in Russia, Lithuania and Poland, you find
     many legends and fairy tales about giants who lived at times in
     these countries but afterwards, disliking the new customs,
     disappeared. In these legends, one may recognize the specific
     foundations of the ancient clans. The giants are brothers. Very
     often the sisters of the giants live on the other shores of the
     lakes or the other side of the mountains. Very often they do not
     like to move from the site but some special event drives them
     from their patrimonial dwelling. Birds and animals are always
     near these giants; as witnesses they follow them and announce
     their departure.

     "...The endless Kurgans of the southern steppes retain around
     them numerous stories about the appearance of the unknown
     warrior, nobody knows from whence. The Carpathian Mountains in
     Hungary have many similar stories of unknown tribes, giant-
     warriors and mysterious cities. If, without prejudice, you
     patiently point out on your map all the legends and stories of
     this nature you will be astonished at the result. When you
     collect all the fairy-tales of lost and subterranean tribes, will
     you not have before you a full map of the migrations?"

According to the self-professed 'Telosian', Sharula Dux, Agharta is the
largest human subterran culture in the world. Also, according to American
Buddhist Robert E. Dickhoff, in his book 'AGHARTA' (referred to above),
some of the Aghartan cavern networks were formerly controlled by the
"serpent" people. These may have been antediluvian systems that were later
taken over by the Reptilian hominoids who left the surface of the earth to
preserve their race from human animosity, an animosity that was fully
justified. These caverns were located beneath the region of Tibet, which
would place them between the Aghartan networks to the northeast that were
occupied by humans, and the Patalan networks to the southwest that were
traditionally occupied by the Reptilians. This is where a major
"altercation" between surface humans and subterran reptilians took place in
recent centuries, according to Robert Dickhoff.

Some of the Reptilians escaped, according to other sources, back to the
deeper cavern systems below the Himalayas and Hindustan, underneath which
(according to Hindu legend) lies the dark and forbidden seven-leveled
cavern world of the 'Nagas' or the serpent beings. Hindu legends say that
the underworld 'capitol' of the Naga's empire (an empire which has been
referred to in different writings as 'Nagaloka', 'Snakeworld', or 'Patala')
is a major center of Reptilian activity known as 'Bhoga-vita'. The NAGAS, a
race of 7-8 ft. tall green-skinned hominoid lizards, are reportedly very
cunning and intelligent and have bases all over the planet. A major base
which 'they' still maintain below Tibet is reportedly located in the
mountains surrounding Lake Manosarowar (see: ON THE SHORES OF ENDLESS
WORLDS, by Andrew Tomas., Souvenir Press. Ltd., London, England., 1974).
