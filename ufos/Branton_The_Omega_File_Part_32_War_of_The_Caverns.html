                      WAR OF THE CAVERNS, by Tom Lucas

If the importance of the caverns beneath Siloam Springs and Eureka Springs
[CIA-Masonic-Mafia 'underground' drug capital in Arkansas...] is a bane of
contention between the picturesque little towns, Hot Springs, Arkansas,
would be the next logical choice for investigation. During the 1930
Prohibition days, it was frequently reported in a Chicago newspaper that
Chicago gangsters traveled often to Hot Springs to go to the horse races
and soak in the hot baths. It seems reasonable, based on what we think we
know now, that during the lulls in recreational activities in Hot Springs,
leaders of the various gangs made discrete trips to the caverns beneath the
city to brag about their latest exploits and to bring offerings of gold.

"To get a rough idea of what a cavern map of the U.S. would look like,
simply pull out a road map of any state and identify all of the dense
population centers, be they cities or hamlets. Where there is a city on the
surface of the earth, there is a city in the caverns below that city...'as
above, so below.' The co-relation breaks down as the size of the population
centers dwindle...
"In the early 1930's, the caverns of Hot Springs must have been the U.S.
capital, or at least a regional area, for the marketers of illegal alcohol.

"Cavern communities close to the surface are probably not completely
self-supporting and require huge injections of funds to keep them going.
These facilities lack the super-technologies of those caverns much deeper
in the earth, and require much gold for trading with people within cities
deeper in the Earth's crust. An ounce of gold in the underworld has as much
or greater buying power than on the surface because the deeper
super-productive cities need all the gold they can get and are willing to
make generous trades for gold. This relieves the near-surface caverns of
the burden of secreting goods and services from the surface world which
would be a real security headache.

"Cities beneath cities, and some hamlets, require injections of wealth from
the surface that doesn't leave paper trails to their caverns. Each cavern
has to develop and specialize in some particular money-making scam, or any
number of sting embezzlements to bring in a constant stream of traceless
cash and gold.

"One cavern, for example, specializes in addictive drug sales, another bank
embezzlement and fraud, another stock market riggings, government money
transfer schemes, along with other more esoteric and less known ways of
generating profit that must eventually be converted to cash and gold that
cannot be traced. The expression underground cash economy is probably a
semi-cryptic phrase that refers directly to installations beneath cities
notorious for dealing only in cash and gold.

(Note: The notorious 'inner world' researcher and writer Richard Shaver did
state that organized crime syndicates were one of the larger elements
operating within the secret cavern systems, and that the term "the
underworld" -- as a description of organized crime networks -- is more than
just a coincidence. - Branton)

"When America was young, developing underground caverns beneath American
cities having a flavor of anarchy similar to communities developing on the
surface, did not at the time have formal relations with each other... not
even "wild-west" sub-surface communities in the American West... "as above,
so below."

"Over a period of time, cavern communities within regional areas
geographically near each other found they had to get along with each other
in a non-competitive manner, to encourage synergetic relationships which
tended to raise the standard of living of each of the involved cavern
communities. Each cavern specialized in an area of crime-monopoly expertise
that wasn't in competition with neighboring caverns. If a regional area
demonstrated it could keep surface dwellers in line -- e.g., keep them
thinking the 'right' thoughts, stifling all real creativity, via the
under-ground's crack people-management teams and organizations on the
surface in the form of police departments, public schools, controlling
secret societies, quack medical fraternities, polished propagandists and
moralists, a sufficiently initiated CLERGY, etcetera -- then this regional
area is allowed to incorporate into a semi-autonomous fiefdom that would
eventually reflect on the surface as "a county" in the U.S... "As above, so
below."

"These underground fiefdoms in the form of counties then combine to form
states; states combine to form the nation... Today, 33 degree Masonry and
the higher degree [33+] is getting ready for the final conflict between
Rightwing Caverns [RWC] and Leftwing Caverns [LWC]. This
[Hegalian/Machievellian] conflict will not be so much a battle between
countries on the surface as it will a war of the caverns. Surface 33+ is
clandestinely developing relatively unknown caverns beneath smaller
communities which 33+ degree confidently feels will not be identified and
destroyed once the conflict begins. Surface 32 degree and below are to be
left on the surface to die with the rest of the 'profane'. The deal is,
knowing a real holocaust is coming, 33+ is planning to abandon the old
underground installations and flee to the new when the time arrives. It
appears that both left and right wing factions will be responsible
responsible for the sacrifice of huge segments of the Earth's above and
below ground populations.

(Take note of the fact that the Jesuit-created Scottish Rite and and the
black gnostic serpent cult of the Illuminati of Bavaria -- which both
collaborated in the establishing of the "33 degree" system of Masonry --
have their ultimate headquarters in ROME and BAVARIA, those two regions
which made up the duel headquarters of the [UN]HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. These
were the same forces which brought about the Macheivellian conflicts
between 'right' and 'left' wing factions in World War I and World War II.
Now they are apparently planning for a third Machievellian global conflict
-- this one being nuclear in scope -- ABOVE and BELOW the surface of the
planet, a conflict which they intend to 'ride-out' in their secret
underground strongholds and eventually emerge to control the upper AND
lower 'worlds'. It would be an elaborate "Helter Skelter" scenario --
Helter Skelter being the term that mass-murderer Charles Manson used for
his plan to incite a race war which he and his 'family' would ride-out in
an underground cavern in the Mojave desert which he referred to as "the
Pit". Once the holocaust had ended and most of those on the surface were
dead, Manson and his followers believed that they would emerge from their
hiding place and rule the world. If such a plan seems to be the product of
an insane mind, then it would appear that Charles Manson was not alone in
his insanity, which is a scary thought. Another thought -- just what part
do the alien Greys play in the 33+ Masons' plans? Incidentally, there are
reportedly several levels above and beyond the 33rd degree, mainly those
which interface with and collaborate with 'alien' fraternities or secret
societies below and beyond planet earth. For instance the 'Alternative 2'
and 'Alternative 3' forces who, in collaboration with the Greys, have
exploited and oppressed numerous 'slave worlds' throughout this sector of
the galaxy -- according to one couple who in UNICUS magazine told of how
they defected from the Alternative-3 agenda after a 'Federation' agent
informed them of these facts. The Nazi 'Neu Schwabians' are deeply involved
in these joint humanoid-reptiloid interstellar atrocities against the
peaceful inhabitants of other colonial worlds. The atrocities of World War
II were just the beginning, since the Nazi 'holocaust', if we are to
believe some 'contactees', has spread beyond the surface of this planet,
both within and without. As for the 33-plus levels of Masonry, according to
former Dulce base security officer Thomas E. Castello -- who possessed one
of the highest security clearances at the base, Ultra-7 -- there were
several security clearances above his own that the 'higher initiates'
held... such as UMBRA, STELLAR, and UMS - UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE. In
his writings Whitley Streiber tells of being taken during an abduction
experience to another desert-like planet with ancient ruins and tall 'Grey'
type beings. He encountered American military personnel on this
interplanetary excursion who were dressed in military kackies, carried
camcorders and other unusual equipment. These military personnel would
probably have possessed a security clearance similar to one of those
mentioned above. According to Castello, President Harry Truman was a 'High
Archon' in the interplanetary lodges and one of the first U.S. Presidents
to establish a secret American treaty with Greys from Alpha Draconis and
Epsilon Bootes as well as with the subterranean Ashtar forces. George Bush
was apparently at one point a 42nd degree Mason, according to another
source who I believe to be reliable. He would have to had been considerably
high in the degrees if he were involved with MJ-12 as is claimed. So the
33+ degrees of Masonry are the alien-interactive levels, and 'we' are meant
to believe that there are ONLY 33 degrees and no more. The Scottish Rite's
infiltration of the Masonic lodges challenged the domination of the more
Judeo-Christian YORK Rite. The Scottish Rite can be traced back to the
Jesuit college of Clermont in France, and at the core it advocates a global
government and the destruction of all national boundaries, sovereignties
and cultures; the dissolution of all traditional "family" structures making
all children the wards of the world state; and the destruction of the idea
that man has a soul -- or rather that humans are merely evolved animals
having no spiritual nature and therefore no need for God. In other words a
homogenized collective society which does not tolerate individual
expression but instead enforces absolute conformity to the controlling
establishment, kind of like the system which the Greys themselves live
under. According to former 33rd degree Mason James Shaw, author of "THE
DEADLY DECEPTION", the U.S. headquarters of the Scottish Rite is located in
the "House of the Temple" in Washington D.C. and, according to some, it
sits directly over an antediluvian system of 'Atlantean' tunnels and
ancient underground chambers called the 'NOD' complex, which serves as a
major NSA-Sirian-Grey center of collaboration. Some believe that the
antediluvian or Atlantean alchemists or sorcerer-scientists had begun
experimenting with elemental forces and that their experiments had gone out
of control and created a temporal rift in the space-time continuum in the
so-called 'Bermuda Triangle' region, opening up a hole between dimensions
and leaving 'electromagnetic fallout' which has had adverse effects to this
day. This was just prior to the global deluge which destroyed their
island-continent. This 'House of the Temple' is, according to Jim Shaw,
filled with murals, statues, and carvings of serpents. In other words it is
a SERPENT cult. This pagan temple actually sits at the northern point of
the PENTAGRAM like street layout of downtown D.C., which is not surprising
when we consider that much of the original construction of Washington D.C.
was carried out by MASONS! After what was supposed to be the culmination of
a lifetime of initiatory work, Shaw was excited about his 33rd degree
initiation which was attended by two former U.S. presidents, a famous
'evangelist', and a Scandinavian king. He was anticipating a type of
spiritual illumination, however the dead, dry ritual and the 'tomb like'
atmosphere of the temple itself was far from inspiring. Following the
disillusioning experience he left the building, looked at the entrance
above which was written "THE SCOTTISH RITE OF FREEMASONRY", and, realizing
that it was all a LIE he sadly said to himself, "It isn't Scottish, it
isn't Rite, and it isn't Free!" He left the lodge and never returned, and
from that day on became a Christian Evangelist and one of its most
notorious critics. Some state that as part of the 33rd degree initiation
one is challenged to blaspheme Christ, spitting on a cross or a Bible or
something of the sort. If the initiate refuses to do so they are told "You
have made the right decision", and remain forever in the 33rd degree. If
they do commit the act of blasphemy however, they are told "You have made
the right decision" and continue their ascension through the degrees beyond
the 33rd. The lowest degrees are presumably 'Christian' and many share
membership jointly in Masonry and Christian denominations. As one ascends
higher, the Christian beliefs are slowly and almost imperceptibly subverted
so by the time the 33rd degree is reached one has arrived on the verge of
Luciferianism. Those who have been through the degrees must admit that what
they are being taught now is almost diametrically opposed to what they were
taught in the lowest degrees. This is the work of the Scottish Rite which
infiltrated the Masonic Lodges for the purposes of using them as a
framework for the establishment of their Godless New World Order. In
Masonry the LODGE is god, 'The Grand Architect of the Universe', which is
simply another name for the Lodge itself. - Branton).

"At the same time underground 33+ develops remote survival caverns -- an
activity generally unknown to underground inhabitants, including 32-, they
are also developing caverns without support communities which, above, could
pinpoint their survival caverns for target purposes... Without support
communities to obscure their activities, surface Masons are deprived of
this advantage.

"When one moves to a cavern without a support community above, it is
similar to a surface dweller moving from the city to the countryside.
Unless there is access to needed goods and services available at alien
facilities much deeper in the earth, each time the remote cavern dweller
needs something from the store he has to travel to a cavern with a support
community above to get what is wanted.

"While in the NAVY, I was told that only five men, who were sworn to
secrecy, decided the targets for America's bombs; also that these five men
were the only ones who know where the bombs were going! This means
targeting information inside the ICBM's are sealed and not even technicians
loading the programs know what is on them. Bombing instructions for nuclear
bomber pilots are sealed. This means submarine captains do not know where
their ICBM's are headed. All the captain does is tell the missile its
location and the missile decides where to go. Apparently an almost
unlimited number of possible target guidance programs are generated and
placed in a library made available to these five men. To be installed in
missiles appropriate for specific targets, all is sealed and safely locked
away.

"I'm sure the method by which all this is done is complex and thought out
in a way understood by none other than the five select men. I doubt the
system has changed since my Navy days of years ago. The activities of these
men and the targets selected are never audited. (Just as the secret
agencies like MJ-12 are never audited since Congressional investigators are
only allowed 'Top Secret' clearances -- whereas MJ-12 and similar agencies
operate at 'Above Top Secret' levels and beyond. In fact the charter for
the NSA, for instance, states that the NSA is exempt from all U.S. laws
which do not specifically mention the NSA within the text. So here is a job
for you Congressional legislators... MENTION the NSA in every new or old
regulatory law that might be applicable! - Branton). The person who told me
this said there is no way of ascertaining if these five men are even on our
side! Though the faces of the men may change over the years, the system of
security remains the same. These five men must all be MASONS, which means
there is much room for mischief.

"300 U.S. citizens were made ready for the 1917 Russian Revolution. Taught
the Russian language and leftwing socialist ideology, they were shipped off
to Russia to form the first politburo. Plainly, this means that socialist
Russia is a tool and puppet state of the United States (Or, more exactly
the Masonic 'Banksters' operating within the U.S. -- as for instance the
Rockefellers, who played a major role in grooming the agents of the
Communist-Socialist revolution in Russia AND the agents of the
National-Socialist revolution in Germany. Whether it is left-handed
Socialism or right-handed Socialism -- Socialism either way you look at it
is TOTALITARIANISM! - Branton). Any recent reforms in Russia will NOT
change the fact that she is still taking orders from [the Bavarian-backed
33+ Jesuit-Masons in] the U.S. [U.N.]. Although the front men may change,
leftwing socialists are very adept at making reforms that increase their
power.

"All of which indicates that it is unlikely that the bulk of America's
atomic arsenal is aimed at Russia, as claimed and, for the most part, it is
unlikely that Russia's atomic arsenal is aimed at the United States. The
only missiles targeted for the U.S. would be aimed at the underground
installations of the most lethal of rightwing adversaries... After all, the
effectiveness of our underground nuclear bomb-testing program is just
that... a test showing just how efficiently each bomb design destroys
underground caverns!...

"Summarizing, it appears that both Russian and American nuclear arsenals
stand ready to fire in concert. But at what? The answer is at all of the
caverns which, occupied by the enemy of World War II (namely, the NAZIS -
Branton), are awaiting the time to deliver THEIR nuclear missiles from
sanctuaries beneath the ANTARCTIC, and from cavern strongholds beneath
SOUTH, CENTRAL and NORTH AMERICA.

(Note: The 33+ themselves are neither against the 'right' nor 'left' wing
forces, but rather control the leadership of each, so as to set the two
forces against each other in a Machievellian or Hegalian scenario -- with
more than a little help from their reptiloid and grey alien advisors. This
plan seems to have been traced back to the MASONIC 'Pontiff' Albert Pike
[who called himself 'the vice-regent of Lucifer' on earth] and his JESUIT
'deputy' Guisseppi Mazzini. According to Des Griffin, Pike and Mazzini
established the 22 Illuminati 'Palladium' lodges for the express purpose of
creating the right-wing Nazi and left-wing Communist movements and to lay
the foundation for three world wars which they hoped would wear-down the
masses to the point where they would accept a New World Order dictatorship
as the only peaceful alternative. From the alien perspective, the New World
Order would offer easier control and massive population reduction at the
same time. As I have suggested, we can also surmise that the 33+ Masons
'leading' the right wing factions and the 33+ Masons 'leading' the left
wing factions are all working closely together along with their reptilian
allies beneath and beyond this planet. When and if the final conflict
breaks out, we can expect the high-ranking 'leaders' of both sides of the
Machievellian conflict to leave the so-called left-wing Communist
Socialists and the so-called right-wing National Socialists to their fate,
with the hope and expectation that they will slaughter each other and
eliminate all resistance when they -- the Roman-Bavarian 33+ Jesuit-Mason
Banksters and their alien 'hosts' in Orion and Draconis as well as some
collaborating factions from Sirius-B / Hale-Bopp, etc. -- emerge to take
control of the planet. In reference to the Sirian collaborators, a major
irony exists in the fact that the Sirius-B zealots connected with the
Hale-Bopp complex -- who are so determined to stage a mass landing on earth
-- may be largely motivated by the fact that several of their allied
underground colonies on earth and in this system have been and are under
attack by the Reptiloid-Grey collectivists. Apparently they believe that by
supporting their secret-society allies here on earth -- who are in turn
intent on establishing a New World Order -- they will be in a better
position to defend themselves and their ancient bases and colonies here
from the Draconians-Greys. Yet, they are in fact serving what they have
been led to believe are "Ascended Masters" within the Hale-Bopp complex
itself, unaware that their beloved "Ashtar" hierarchy has long since been
infiltrated by Orionite Dracos and Greys. In a similar manner, the
Orion-backed Jesuit Lodge had managed to infiltrate the Sirian backed
Masonic Lodge on earth via the Jesuit Scottish Rite, and just as the
Sirians have been duped into submitting to the agenda of the Orionites in
Hale-Boop, the Masons have been duped into forming an alliince with the
Jesuits in the form of the Bildeberg society. If the Masonic Lodge and our
own Constitutional U.S. Government can be infiltrated by Draconian-Orionite
interventionists, then are those from Sirius-B who live in an even more
collectivist system any more exempt from the same threat? Maybe one day
they, AND WE, will learn that the Draconians are playing for keeps and that
there is NO level of deception to which they will NOT sink in order to get
their way. Just like us, the Sirians and their Masonic representatives on
earth have been so concerned about defending themselves from an 'enemy
without', that they AND WE have ignored the infiltratration of the 'enemy
within'. - Branton)
"This explains why the U.S. and Russia have such a large surplus of atomic
bombs. Caverns tend to be nuclear proof, except for direct hits which mean
that at least one bomb is needed per cavern, and perhaps several just in
case the first one fails to make it. All those bombs going off will have a
negative environmental impact on all life on the surface; but the 33+ plan
to be safe and snug in their holes. -Branton)

"Both sides could fire all their arsenals at once; but this is unlikely to
happen. World War II will be PROTRACTED [like a chess-game] and both sides
will agree to a standard set of rules for war.

"As the war progresses and the world's standard of living drops, squabbles
over remaining resources will become frequent, and pointed. States will
fight states, counties will fight counties, towns will fight towns, all of
which will reflect the political biases and inclinations of controlling
caverns beneath.

"Did you know that only group organisms such as ant hills and termite
colonies -- and masonic controlled men -- indulge in mass warfare? Nothing
else in nature does.

"All group organisms, such as bee hives, use sex odors [via the queen bee]
to induce conformity in the hive or colony. [Scottish Rite] Masonry is most
similar to the termite colony in that both chew away at the foundations of
civilization and neither can stand the light of day.

"Masonry may not use sex odors to induce conformity and absorption into the
group organism but it does use mesmerizing, hypnotic rays that may have
sexual content to it. Selfless devotion to service, faceless anonymity,
slavish devotion to a noble ideal... for the good of the whole, work
without compensation, profitless causes, these are the value-philosophical
ideals of an and in an ant hill, a termite in a termite colony...and a
mason in a masonic organism.

"Interesting is how cleverly encyclopedias talk about springs but never
caverns, and that De Sota was more curious about caverns than springs. The
tunnels I recently learned of that lead off from basement rooms in the old
KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS TEMPLE in Springfield, Missouri, which is in the heart
of the Ozarks, gives pause for a lot of wonder and conjecture. Until
recently, I thought only a few surface dwellers knew and had access to the
Underworld, but it now appears to be common knowledge among those of a
specific segment of the population... It's just that those who talk don't
live long."

More of what the 'Aryan elite' plan for America and the world was revealed
in a lecture given by the late Phil Schneider, who was murdered [strangled
to death] by persons unknown shortly after giving this speech:

"I love the country I am living in, more than I love my life, but I would
not be standing before you now, risking my life, if I did not believe it
was so. The first part of this talk is going to concern deep underground
military bases and the black budget. The Black Budget is a secretive budget
that garners 25% of the gross national product of the United States. The
Black Budget currently consumes $1.25 trillion per [2] years. At least this
amount is used in black programs, like those concerned with deep
underground military bases. Presently,there are 129 deep underground
military bases in the United States.

"They have been building these 129 bases day and night, unceasingly, since
the early 1940's. Some of them were built even earlier than that. These
bases are basically large cities underground connected by high-speed
magneto-leviton trains that have speeds up to Mach 2. Several books have
been written about this activity. Al Bielek has my only copy of one of
them. Richard Souder, a Ph.D architect, has risked his life by talking
about this. He worked with a number of government agencies on deep
underground military bases. In around where you live, in Idaho, there are
11 of them.

"The average depth of these bases is over a mile, and they again are
basically whole cities underground. They all are between 2.66 and 4.25
cubic miles in size. They have laser drilling machines that can drill a
tunnel seven miles long in one day. The Black Projects sidestep the
authority of CONGRESS, which as we know is illegal. Right now, the New
World Order is depending on these bases. If I had known at the time I was
working on them that the NWO was involved, I would not have done it. I was
LIED to rather extensively.

"Basically, as far as technology is concerned, for every calendar year that
transpires, military technology increases about 44.5 years. This is why it
is easy to understand that back in 1943 they were able to create, through
the use of vacuum tube technology, a ship that could literally disappear
from one place and appear in another place. My father, Otto Oscar
Schneider, fought on both sides of the war. He was originally a U-boat
captain, and was captured and repatriated in the United States. He was
involved with different kinds of concerns, such as the A-bomb, the H-bomb
and the Philadelphia Experiment. He invented a high-speed camera that took
pictures of the first atomic (Hydrogen or H-Bomb - Branton) tests at Bikini
Island on July 12, 1946. I have original photographs of that test, and the
photos also show UFO's fleeing the bomb site at a high rate of speed.
Bikini Island at the time was infested with them, especially under the
water, and the natives had problems with their animals being mutilated. At
that time, General McArthur felt that the next war would be with aliens
from other worlds.

"Anyway, my father laid the groundwork with theoreticians about the
Philadelphia experiment, as well as other experiments. What does that have
to do with me? Nothing, other than the fact that he was my father. I don't
agree with what he did on the other side, but I think he had a lot of guts
in coming here. He was hated in Germany. There was a $1 million reward,
payable in gold, to anyone who killed him. Obviously, they didn't succeed.
Anyway, back to our topic -- deep underground bases.
"Back in 1954, under the Eisenhower administration, the 'federal'
government decided to circumvent the Constitution of the United States and
form a treaty with alien entities. It was called the 1954 Greada Treaty
(Eisenhower administration -- established contact-landings at Holloman AFB,
New Mexico; and Muroc-Edwards AFB, California in 1954. This was a year
after the 'Greys' had established geosynchronous orbits around our planet
within two 'planetoids' that had been engineered to serve as operational
bases for later abduction, implantation, cattle mutilation, base
construction, and infiltration operations. - Branton), which basically made
the agreement that the aliens involved could take a few cows and test their
implanting techniques on a few human beings, but that they had to give
details about the people involved. Slowly, the aliens altered the bargain
until they decided they wouldn't abide by it at all. Back in 1979, this was
the reality, and the fire-fight at Dulce occurred quite by accident. I was
involved in building an ADDITION to the deep underground military base at
Dulce, which is probably the deepest base. It goes down seven levels and
over 2.5 miles deep. At that particular time, we had drilled four distinct
holes in the desert, and we were going to link them together and blow out
large sections at a time. My job was to go down the holes and check the
rock samples, and recommend the explosive to deal with the particular rock.
As I was headed down there, we found ourselves amidst a large cavern that
was full of outer-space (or "inner-space"? - Branton) aliens, otherwise
known as large Greys. I shot two of them. At that time, there were 30
people down there. About 40 more came down after this started, and all of
them got killed. We had surprised a whole underground base of existing
aliens. Later, we found out that they had been living in our planet for a
long time... This could explain a lot of what is behind the theory of
ancient astronauts.

(Note: This report seems to reveal a limited 'perspective' on the overall
'Dulce wars' based on the experience of one man. It appears however from a
number of sources as if there was much more involved in the overall
scenario than what Phil Schneider describes. For instance from Phil's
description it would appear as if his team broke-in to the base
'accidentally'. It could have been that IN RESPONSE to the captured
scientists mentioned by Thomas Edwin Castello and others, special military
forces and agents intentionally attempted to break-in to the underground
alien bases through a "back door" so-to-speak, yet Schneider may have not
been aware of this part. Other reports would suggest that the conflict was
more complex than this, involving more than one firefight. According to
Thomas Castello, John Lear, Bill Cooper, and other sources, the "Dulce
Wars" involved AT LEAST a hundred highly-trained special forces, including
Delta force Black Berets, Air Force Blue Berets, Division 5 FBI, CIA, and
Secret Service. Because of the "cover-up", special forces units with the
necessary security clearances for this type of operation were rare.
Needless to say, this "war" did not have the full backing of Congress and
the American people, and this no doubt contributed to the loss of the 66
special force personnel who died in the conflict. Following the
confrontation, the U.S. 'government' withdrew from all negotiations with
the Greys and a rift began to develop within the Intelligence Community. It
appears as if this split can be traced back to Kirtland AFB in New Mexico,
which became divided over what to do about the Dulce situation and the
aliens in general. Col. Edwards and the Wing Commander wanted to support
Paul Bennewitz in a full-scale investigation of Dulce and they petitioned
the White House, which at first agreed and told them to go ahead with the
project... that is until forces 'elsewhere' in the intelligence community
began to bring pressure against the White House and Kirtland AFB to drop
the whole thing. Kirtland AFB Col. Richard Doty seems to have been torn
between two intelligence agendas, explaining his seemingly schizophrenic
reversals in policy regarding Dulce and related matters. Some segments of
U.S. intelligence wanted to declare war on the Greys and develop SDI
weapons that could be used against them in space and underground, whereas
others -- apparently motivated by more sinister motives -- desired to
continue negotiations. Two years following the Dulce wars, AQUARIUS and
MAJI re-established negotiations with the Greys at Dulce for the purpose it
would seem of gaining continued access to mind control technology for their
New World Order agenda. - Branton)

"Anyway, I got shot in the chest with one of their weapons, which was a box
on their body, that blew a hole in me and gave me a nasty dose of cobalt
radiation. I have had cancer because of that.

"I didn't get really interested in UFO technology until I started work at
Area 51, north of Las Vegas. After about two years recuperating after the
1979 incident, I went back to work for Morrison and Knudson, EG&G and other
companies. At Area 51, they were testing all kinds of peculiar spacecraft.
How many people here are familiar with Bob Lazar's story? He was a
physicist working at Area 51 trying to decipher the propulsion factor in
some of these craft.

"Now, I am very worried about the activity of the federal government. They
have lied to the public, stonewalled senators, and have refused to tell the
truth in regard to alien matters. I can go on and on. I can tell you that I
am rather disgruntled.

Recently, I knew someone who lived near where I live in Portland, Oregon.
He worked at Gunderson Steel Fabrication, where they make railroad cars.
Now, I knew this fellow for the better part of 30 years, and he was kind of
a quiet type. He came in to see me one day, excited, and he told me
"they're building prisoner cars." He was nervous. Gunderson, he said, had a
contract with the federal government to build 107,200 full length railroad
cars, each with 143 pairs of shackles. There are 11 sub-contractors in this
giant project. Supposedly, Gunderson got over 2 billion dollars for the
contract. Bethlehem Steel and other steel outfits are involved. He showed
me one of the cars in the rail yards in North Portland. He was right. If
you multiply 107,200 times 143 times 11, you come up with about 15,000,000.
This is probably the number of people who disagree with the federal
government. No more can you vote any of these people out of office. Our
present structure of government is 'technocracy', not democracy, and it is
a form of feudalism.

(I would venture to say that it is more like a techno-monarchy, since
several of the U.S. presidents since Truman have been placed in office with
Rockefeller financial-media backing, suggesting that these same presidents
were inclined to favor certain Rockefeller corporate agendas over the
interests of the American people. The Techno-Monarchy would constitute
those parts of the Military-Industrial Complex or M.I.C. that are largely
influenced by Rockefeller and European Black Nobility interests. When the
American Union was young, the Continental Congress was fearful that the
roots of Monarchy might rise within the new Republic. There were critics
who suggested that we should not even have a Chief Executive or a President
for this very reason, however by majority vote they installed George
Washington as the first U.S. President with the hopes that all those who
came after him would follow his example of selfless devotion and
patriotism. Unfortunatelly the Continental Congress was wrong, and had
overestimated the integrity of those U.S. 'Presidents' who would come
later. - Branton).

It [our present form of government] has nothing to do with the republic of
the United States. These people are god-less, and have legislated out
prayer in public schools. You can get fined up to $100,000 and two years in
prison for praying in school. I believe we can do better. I also believe
that the federal government is running the gambit of enslaving the people
of the United States. I am not a very good speaker, but I'll keep shooting
my mouth off until somebody puts a bullet in me, because it's worth it to
talk to a group like this about these atrocities.

"There are other problems. I have some interesting 1993 figures. There are
29 prototype stealth aircraft presently. The budget from the U.S. Congress
five-year plan for these is $245.6 million. You couldn't buy the spare
parts for these black programs for that amount. So, we've been lied to. The
black budget is roughly $1.3 trillion every two years. A trillion is a
thousand billion. A trillion dollars weighs 11 tons. The U.S. Congress
never sees the books involved with this clandestine pot of gold.
Contractors of [these] programs: EG&G, Westinghouse, McDonnell Douglas,
Morrison-Knudson, Wackenhut Security Systems, Boeing Aerospace, Lorimar
Aerospace, Aerospacial in France, Mitsubishi Industries, Rider Trucks,
Bechtel, *I.G. Farben*, plus a host of hundreds more. Is this what we are
supposed to be living up to as freedom-loving people? I don't believe so.

"Still, 68% of the military budget is directly or indirectly affected by
the black budget. Star Wars relies heavily upon stealth weaponry. By the
way, none of the stealth program would have been available if we had not
taken apart crashed alien disks. None of it. Some of you might ask what the
"space shuttle" is "shuttling". Large ingots of special metals that are
milled in space and cannot be produced on the surface of the earth. They
need the near vacuum of outer space to produce them. We are not even being
told anything close to the truth. I believe our government officials have
SOLD us down the drain -- lock, stock and barrel. Up until several weeks
ago, I was employed by the U.S. government with a Ryolite-38 clearance
factor, one of the highest in the world. I believe the Star Wars program is
there solely to act as a buffer to prevent alien attack -- it has nothing
to do with the "cold war", which was only a toy to garner money from all
the people -- for what? The whole lie was planned and executed for the last
75 years.

"Here's another piece of information for you folks. The Drug Enforcement
Administration and the ATF rely on stealth tactical weaponry for as much as
40% of their operations budget. This in 1993, and the figures have gone up
considerably since. The United Nations used American stealth aircraft for
over 28% of its collective worldwide operations from 1990 to 1992,
according to the Center for Strategic Studies and UN Report 3092.

"I don't perceive at this time that we have too much more than six months
of life left in this country, at the present rate. We are the laughing
stock of the world, because we are being hood-winked by so many evil people
that are running this country. I think we can do better. I think the people
over 45 are seriously worried about their future. I'm going to run some
scary scenarios by you. The Contract With America. It contains the same
terminology that Adolph Hitler used to subvert Germany in 1931. I believe
we can do better. The Contract With America (or is it the "Contract ON
America"? - Branton) is a last ditch effort by our federal government to
tear away the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

"The black helicopters. There are over 64,000 black helicopters in the
United States. For every hour that goes by, there is one being built. Is
this the proper use of our money? What does the federal government need
64,000 tactical helicopters for, if they are not trying to enslave us. I
doubt if the entire military needs 64,000 worldwide. I doubt if all the
world needs that many. There are 157 F-117A stealth aircraft loaded with
LIDAR and computer-enhanced imaging radar. They can see you walking from
room to room when they fly over your house. They see objects in the house
from the air with a variation limit of 1 inch to 30,000 miles. That's how
accurate that is. Now, I worked in the federal government for a long time,
and I know exactly how they handle their business..."

On Oct. 20, 1991, California researcher Michael Lindemann, founder of 'The
20/20 Group', gave a lecture before a large crowd of interested
investigators. During the course of his lecture wherein he discussed the
Military-Industrial Complex's underground bases outside of Lancaster,
California, he made the following statements:

"...How many of you have seen the book 'BLANK CHECK'?... It is not a UFO
book. I strongly recommend that you read the book 'BLANK CHECK' so that you
can understand something about how these projects are funded without your
say so, indeed WITHOUT THE SAY SO OF CONGRESS. Most citizens don't know for
example that the National Security Act of 1947 made it illegal to ever say
how much money is spent on the CIA. Indeed all of our tremendous alphabet
soup collection of Intelligence Agencies. Whether your talking about the
CIA, or the NRO, or the NSA or the DIA, etc., all of them are in the same
category.

"You cannot say how much these things cost. All you can do if you want to
find out is add-up the numbers on the Budget that aren't assigned to
anything that actually means anything. There are these huge categories that
have tens of billions of dollars in them that say nothing but 'Special
Projects...' And every year the Congress dutifully passes this bloated
budget that has some $300,000,000,000 or more with HUGE chunks of cash
labeled like that: 'Special Projects,' 'Unusual Stuff.' -- Ten billion
dollars. O.K., well where does the 'unusual stuff' money go? Well, it DOES
go to 'unusual stuff', that's for sure, and one of the places it goes is
that it goes into the underground bases. Indeed TIM said recently since the
publication of his book [BLANK CHECK]... MORE Black Budget money goes into
UNDERGROUND BASES than ANY OTHER kind of work.

"Now I don't believe that 35 billion, which is the approximate size of the
black budget money that you can find by analyzing the budget, I don't think
that comes CLOSE to the real figure because there is absolutely unequivocal
evidence that a great deal of additional money was generated in other ways,
such as the surreptitious running of guns and drugs. And one wonderful
example of that is coming to light with the B.C.C.I. scandal which I hope
you've heard of... a number of very high-ranking American officials are
caught in the undertow of the BCCI tidal wave... Even though these guys are
tying to pull 'fast ones' on an immense scale they are getting caught.
These things don't always work. Indeed they are very, very vulnerable.

Indeed this whole 'end game' is very vulnerable and that's why they feel it
requires such secrecy. The American people wouldn't stand for this stuff if
they had the information, and that's the reason why we have to get the
information out and take it seriously because it really is a matter of our
money and our future that's being mortgaged here.

"But my friend who worked in the underground bases, who was doing
sheet-rock was down on, he thinks, approximately the 30th level
underground... these bases are perhaps 30-35 stories deep
['ground-scrapers']. As I say they are not just mine shafts, these are
huge, giant facilities... many city blocks in circumference, able to house
tens of thousands of people. One of them, the YANO Facility [we're told...
by the county fire dept. director, the county fire dept. chief who had to
go in there to look at a minor fire infraction] there's a 400-car parking
lot on the 1st level of the YANO Facility, but cars never come in and out,
those are the cars that they use INSIDE.

"O.K., so... a very interesting situation down there. Our guy was doing
sheet-rock on the 30th floor, maybe the 30th floor, underground. He and his
crew are working on a wall and right over here is an elevator door. The
elevator door opens and, a kind of reflex action you look, and he saw three
'guys'. Two of them, human engineers that he's seen before. And between
them a 'guy' that stood about 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall. Green skin, reptilian
features, extra-long arms, wearing a lab coat, holding a clip-board...

"I tend to believe that story because, first of all because we have other
stories like it, but more importantly because he walked off that job that
very day. And he was getting paid a GREAT deal of money... If your
basically a sheet-rock kind of guy, if you can do sheet-rock in a place
like that then you get paid way more than standard sheet-rock wages, you
can count on it.
"So, he walked off that job. His buddy on that same crew turned into an
alcoholic shortly after. This is an extremely upsetting thing. You know, it
wasn't like this alien jumped out and bit his head off or anything, it was
just standing there for a few minutes, the doors closed. He has a feeling
that that elevator was malfunctioning, otherwise he never would have seen
that except by accident..."

Several people have referred to the underground as well as the operational
'connections' between the Dulce base in New Mexico and the Dreamland base
in Nevada, connections that exist via Dougway, Utah and Page, Arizona. From
Dreamland/Area 51/S-4 these underground systems reportedly extend towards
the Edwards AFB/Lancaster/Tehachapi region where so many
Military-Industrial-Aerospace operations are being carried out. If alien
forces are intent on taking control of this planet, then it would be
logical for them to target our most strategic military-industrial weapons
research and development center. This might involve actual 'infiltration'
of our military-industrial complexes and control of the line-of-command
through mind control of specific and strategic personnel. In many cases
patriotic Americans have become caught in the middle of this 'underground
war' between loyal American military personnel and alien or
alien-controlled 'personnel', as in the Dulce and the Groom wars
themselves. The 'deeper' one descends into the underground 'alien empire'
the greater the security and therefore the greater the 'control' will be.

Michael Riconosciuto, a former Wackenhut employee, claims that at Area 51
when one goes past a certain level of security they are either dead or
disappear. Riconosciuto's father Marshal Riconosciuto was a
Hitler-supporter and a close friend of Fred L. Crisman, who was involved
with the Maurey Island Incident, was an agent of Military-Industrial
Intelligence, and was in turn a close friend of Clay Shaw who Louisiana
District Attorney James Garrison accused of being the CIA-Mafia go-between
in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Garrison might have convicted Clay
Shaw if not for the fact that Garrison's star witness David Ferry was
killed a few days before he was to testify at Clay Shaw's trial. Anyway,
Michael Riconosciuto told reporters that when he worked for Wackenhut at
the Nevada Test Site before he was 'framed' on drug charges and put in a
Federal Prison, he and several others tried to get damning evidence and
documents out of the base on a helicopter, data apparently dealing with
unconstitutional biogenetic activities, alien interaction in the
underground facilities, etc. This helicopter was shot down before it could
leave the base and the five people on board were killed. How many brave
freedom-loving Americans have to DIE before we finally wake up from our
apathetic skepticism and realize that WE ARE AT WAR!? Must we have a repeat
of the Holocaust, and only after the fact hear such pitiful excuses like
those that followed World War II?: "Yes, we heard the reports about the
concentration camps, but they seemed too fantastic to be believed, so we
didn't bother bombing the ovens or the train tracks leading to the death
camps..." Or maybe: "Underground bases and concentration camps that have
undermined America, where Nazis and Aliens are working together in a joint
effort to impose a global dictatorship on this planet? Come on, how were we
supposed to have believed something so fantastic?..."

When all is said and done I will probably be seen as one of America's
greatest heros or one of the nations most notorious fools. To tell you the
truth I could really care less. I would rather be seen as a fool rather
than risk the lives of thousands or possibly millions of people who might
turn out to be the potential victims of a cosmic conspiracy which I
'perceive' to be taking place, one which has specifically targeted America
and her citizens. So then, at the risk of being a fool, I'll just go for
broke and expose those specific areas where I 'perceive' the
'collaboration' maintains underground strongholds, based on what I have
learned through years of research, personal experience, and interaction
with others who have their own stories to tell about such an 'underground
invasion' of North America...

Within the United States, the following joint operational bases --
operating under the control of Bavarian and Draconian intelligence agencies
-- have been identified by various researchers, beginning with the major
facility near Dulce, New Mexico. Other facilities of this nature include
Page, Arizona; Dougway, Utah; Nevada Test Site; the Madigan facility near
Ft. Lewis, Washington; Deep Springs, California; Mt. Lassen, California;
Lancaster, California; Montauk, Long Island; the Denver International
Airport; Granite Mountain - Little Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake City, Utah;
Sleeping Ute Mountain on the Ute Reservation of SE Utah; and Creede,
Colorado.

Other underground facilities for the New World Order itself are
[apparently] occupied exclusively by lower-ranking levels of the
collaboration which are nevertheless controlled by the 'serpent cult' of
humanoid and reptiloid collaborators in the 'joint operational' facilities.
Many of the 'closed' military bases in the United State possess underground
facilities which are occupied by U.N. troops from various countries.
Several Federal Buildings in many major cities also reportedly have
underground facilities equipped with massive military weapons stashes, such
as the Oklahoma City Federal Building which contains a 15 level base
underneath, which was revealed during the initial local reports of the
bombing of the federal building there -- although these references to the
underground tunnels were censored by the time the story reached national
and international audiences. Since Oklahoma City and Airport are intended
to be a major FEMA / U.N. 'relocation' processing center, one has to ask
just which 'side' had stashed the underground arsenals there, the American,
or New World Order government? Also FEMA itself maintains SEVERAL
underground facilities, many of them located beneath major airports
throughout the United States... Could America be facing a four-fold
invasion force in the future... via air, sea, land as well as an 'invasion'
from the underground networks of the Military-Industrial Complex?
