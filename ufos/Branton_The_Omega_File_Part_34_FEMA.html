Although an excellent article, the January 1995 edition of 'Monitoring
Times' magazine published only a tiny portion of what FEMA has been tasked
by Executive Order to perform. FEMA was brought into existence by E.O. All
the frequencies I have for FEMA follow my comments here:

Federal Emergency Management Agency [F.E.M.A.] [and other emergency
agencies]:

F.E.M.A. [Federal Emergency Management Agency] has been authorized for the
past 15 years by Presidential Executive Orders to confiscate ALL PROPERTY
from the American People, separate families in the current 43 internment
camps [already built and operational by the way, 5 of which are located in
Georgia. The largest can confine somewhere on the order of 100,000 American
citizens], called relocation camps by the 'government', for assignment to
work camps; declares martial law and TOTALLY OVER-RIDES the U.S.
Constitution. Presidential Executive Orders that are related or control
this are given at the end of this. Two of the state prisons here in Georgia
are currently empty, although manned by a minimal number of staff, have
been setup and intentionally unpopulated by prisoners just to support this
political policy.

Concentration [internment] Camps. An Executive Order signed by then
President BUSH in 1989 authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[F.E.M.A.] to build 43 primary camps [having a capacity of 35,000 to 45,000
prisoners EACH] and also authorized hundreds of secondary facilities. It is
interesting to note that several of these facilities can accommodate
100,000 prisoners. These facilities have been completed and many are
already manned but as yet contain no prisoners. [Remember all the TALK of
over-crowded prisons that exist...]. In south Georgia there are several
state prisons that except for a few guards, are completely devoid of
prisoners.

Under F.E.M.A., the Executive Orders which are already written and is the
current law of the land, calls for the COMPLETE suspension of the United
States Constitution, all rights and liberties, as they are currently known.
The following executive orders, which are in the Federal Register located
in Washington DC for anyone to request copies of, call for the suspension
of all civil rights and liberties and for extraordinary measures to be
taken in, as most of the orders state, "any national security emergency
situation that might confront the government." When F.E.M.A. is
implemented, the following executive orders will be immediately enforced:

E.O. 12148 - FEMA national security emergency, such as: national disaster,
social unrest, insurrection, or national financial crisis.
E.O. 10995 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL communications media in
the United States."
E.O. 10997 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL electric power,
petroleum, gas, fuels and minerals, both public and private."
E.O. 10998 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL food supplies and
resources, public and private, and ALL farms, lands, and equipment."
E.O. 10999 - "... provides for the seizure of ALL means of transportation,
including PERSONAL cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and TOTAL CONTROL
over all highways, seaports, and waterways."
E.O. 11000 - "... provides for the SEIZURE OF ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE for work
forces under federal supervision, including SPLITTING UP OF FAMILIES if the
government has to."
E.O. 11001 - "... provides for government seizure of ALL health, education
and welfare functions."
E.O. 11002 - "... designates the postmaster general to operate a national
REGISTRATION of all persons." [Under this order, you would report to your
local post office to be separated and assigned to a new area. Here is where
families would be separated].
E.O. 11003 - "... provides for the government to take over ALL airports and
aircraft, commercial, public and PRIVATE."
E.O. 11004 - "... provides for the Housing and Finance Authority to
relocate communities, designate areas to be abandoned and establish new
locations for populations."
E.O. 11005 - "... provides for the government to TAKE OVER railroads,
inland waterways, and public storage facilities."
E.O. 11051 - "... the office of Emergency Planning [has] complete
authorization to put the above orders into effect in time of increased
international tension or economic or financial crisis."

All of the above executive orders were combined by President NIXON into
Executive Order 11490, which allows all of this to take place if a national
emergency is declared by the President. The burning and insurrection in Los
Angeles in the case of Rodney King could have executed [and partially did
execute] these Executive Orders.

Executive Order 12919: "National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness"
signed by CLINTON June 3, 1994, delegates authorities, responsibilities and
allocations of F.E.M.A.'s Executive Orders [last entry] for the
confiscation of ALL PROPERTY from the American people, and their
re-location and assignment to 'labor' camps. The Executive Order also
supersedes or revokes eleven (11) previous Executive Orders [from 1939
through 1991] and amends Executive Order 10789 and 11790. This executive
order is A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE by the [Secret]
Government of the United States in concert with the UNITED NATIONS.
Operation Dragnet. Janet Reno can implement this operation upon receiving
one call from the President. Arrest warrants will be issued via computer to
round-up over 1 MILLION PATRIOTIC AMERICANS who may 'resist' the NEW WORLD
ORDER. Americans who are not 'politically correct.' Specifically mentioned
are CHRISTIANS or those who read the Bible. Concentration/internment camps
have already been built to accommodate these American prisoners. See above
paragraph as these internment camps have been setup and are run by F.E.M.A.

(Note: In reference to Christians, just where should they/we stand in
regards to defending America? Should Christians take up arms if necessary?
Apparently the Founding fathers of the American Republic believed so, so
long as it was in order to DEFEND their country, their women and
children... and NOT in order to engage in offensive warfare for the sake of
conquering and exploiting others, which to me would be "living by the
sword" or you could say "making a living" by the sword. This could be
exemplified by the Germans who initiated unprovoked invasions of their
neighbors to meet their economic needs during World Wars I and II. One
might ask, what about all the Orthodox Jews and Greek Orthodox Christians
who went to their deaths like lambs to the slaughter without resisting
during World War II? Why didn't they fight more zealously to defend
themselves? That is a hard question and one that I don't have an answer
for. It may have simply come down to a lack of unity of faith and
understanding of the threat. All I can say is that from my study of the Old
and New Testaments, I find no passage that forbids us from defending
ourselves from aggressors -- at least in a national sense, however we ARE
forbidden to become the unprovoked aggressors ourselves or engage in
conflicts which are offensive rather than defensive oriented. The offensive
attacks against the native Americans for instance, resulting from the Anglo
invasion of North America, can NOT be justified through scripture, and such
policies and mistreatment of the native Americans, the continuous betrayal
of treaties, and the stealing of their God-given land in the past have or
will doubtless have an adverse affect on America's destiny UNLESS
reparations are made to the native peoples -- for instance a restoration of
historical territories. Perhaps the Greys felt justified in repeatedly
violating our government's secret 'treaties' with them because 'we' had
done the exact same thing to the native Americans? Perhaps we in part
DESERVED the abuses that the Greys have inflicted upon us? Perhaps our
nation's destiny will be largely determined by how we treat the native
Americans from here on out, whether or not we begin to honor ALL of the
treaties that 'we' had made and broken in the past? Could it be? On the
other hand, if OFFENSIVE warfare is forbidden by God, then DEFENSIVE
warfare against a foreign invasion of American soil -- or an internal
threat to our freedoms, as guaranteed in the Bill of Rights WOULD, from my
perspective, be justified. In Psalm 125:3 we read how the rule of the
wicked is a DIRECT VIOLATION of the will of God: "...For the wicked shall
not rule the godly, lest the godly be forced to do wrong." A perfect
example would be the Lutherans of Germany who all-too-often capitulated to
the Nazi's who themselves were backed by Luciferian cults which the
Christians should have resisted. Instead, many of these backslidden
Christians in Germany grudgingly supported the atrocities of their Nazi
leaders, and by default the extermination of millions of Jewish, Gypsy and
Slavic men, women and children. Why could Martin Luther himself stand alone
against hundreds of pompish religious hypocrites at the council of Worms in
Germany and boldly accuse them of blasphemy to their faces, yet many of his
Protestant followers -- not detracting from those few brave souls who DID
resist -- gave-in right and left to the Nazi satanists, and in some cases
even contributed to the atrocities of World Wars I and II? So in short, if
a situation exists wherein an offender or a defender must die -- one or the
other so that the other could live -- then the defender would be the one
who should keep his or her life. In warfare, the INVADER should be
considered a 'murderer' for killing a human being; whereas if the INVADED
took the life of an invader, it should be considered 'execution' in
retribution for the murderous acts of the invaders themselves. All of this
would be justified in the name of and according to the rules of the society
which gives the defending citizens the power to defend his or her country,
just as one is authorized to use deadly force against an unwelcome intruder
into their home if they feel their life is being threatened. The only
exception to this would be an offensive invasion of an allied country which
has been invaded by an enemy force, or the SELECTIVE invasion of an enemy
country in order to rescue allied citizens who are being held within a
targeted region -- as in underground bases for instance? -- in which case
the invasion should be considered a form of self-defense on behalf of their
own citizens, so long as the invader REMAINS in a mode of 'offensive
defense'. - Branton)

Operation Rolling Thunder. Reno and Benson have mentioned this operation
which comprises county-wide sweeps of house to house, dynamic entry, search
and seizures for all guns and food stockpiles by B.A.T.F., state national
guard, activity duty soldiers, as well as local police. This function is
also run and coordinated through F.E.M.A.

Public Law 100-690 banned almost ALL RELIGIOUS GATHERINGS [not yet
enforced..].

(Note: When and if this is enforced, this will be a blatant defecation upon
the BILL OF RIGHTS, and in this event every true American is allowed -- and
in fact it will be his and her Patriotic DUTY -- to implement the clause
within the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE to OVERTHROW such an alien or
FOREIGN tyranny-structure which has like a tape-worm infested the governing
'body' of America. - Branton); grants no-knock search and seizures without
a search warrant; expands the drug laws to include EVERY American. This
will generally be the prelude, or in addition to, a F.E.M.A. operation and
contingency plan implementation. The Omnibus Crime Bill of 1990. Ensures
confiscation of all private property via money laundering, environmental
violations of the Clean Water and Air Act, and extends as far as child
abuse. This act also coordinates activities through F.E.M.A. and the
Department of the Army, Commanding General, U.S. Forces Command, Fort
McPherson, GA which is the executive and implementing agency upon
initiation of many of these acts. The responsible agency within U.S. Army
Forces Command was what used to be known as the Deputy Chief of Staff for
Operations, Plans Division [DCSOPS, Plans], which was changed several years
ago to J-3 after the Headquarters became a joint headquarters. They keep on
file copies of all F.E.M.A. Emergency Management Operation Plans, including
those plans developed by the Army to support the F.E.M.A. plan to eliminate
the U.S. Constitution upon implementation. According to current plans, the
Constitution will be 'temporarily' discontinued and shelved until the real
or perceived and declared 'threat' has been neutralized (ask yourself --
who or what is the REAL threat that needs to be 'neutralized'? - Branton).

But once 'shelved,' as with almost every other action of the Government, it
STAYS shelved.

The Crime Bill of 1994. Banning of all military weapons which are necessary
to the formation of a militia [when needed], denies other military
equipment to the people's militia units (that's OK... the average American
gun owner can legally acquire this 'equipment' from off the DEAD BODIES of
UN/FEMA-backed gestapo forces when they break-in to our homes to steal our
personal property or try to take us and our families prisoner without due
process of law. - Branton), prelude to confiscating ALL guns in the hands
of private citizens, DESTROYS the 1st Amendment, and makes virtually every
American an outlaw. See above comments concerning the house-to-house
search. The agency responsible for the actual implementation and search is
the Department of the Army in concert with local and state police,
including F.E.M.A., FBI, BATF, and other Federal Agencies.

SECRET UNDERGROUND BASES. There have been documented over 60 secret,
VIRTUAL CITIES, UNDERGROUND, build by the government, Federal Reserve Bank
Owners (such as the 'Rockefellers', etc. - Branton), and high ranking
members of the Committee of 300 [some of these under-ground areas can be
seen in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas]. In additional,
there exist underground Satellite Tracking Facilities which have the
ability to punch your 911 address into the computer and a satellite can
within seconds bring a camera to bear on your property to the point that
those monitoring can read a license number on an automobile in your
driveway. These facilities have as of Oct. 1, 1994, been turned over to the
[foreign power of the] UNITED NATIONS.

(Note: Forget the license plate, according to information released by Norio
Hayakawa, this satellite technology is now so sophisticated that they can
CLEARLY read every word on your driver's LICENSE supposing it were in view
of the satellite. - Branton)
