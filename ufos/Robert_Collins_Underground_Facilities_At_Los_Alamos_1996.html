Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Underground Facilities (SCIFs) at
     Los Alamos National Lab where "Alien" artifacts are kept ??

                           by Robert M. Collins

                                 07-29-96

After the supposed "alien" artifacts were moved out of WPAFB, Ohio in the
1982/83 time frame the next question would be: Where did they go? Well, 
two places have been reported: the NSA facility at Ft Huachuca in Arizona
and Los Alamos National Labs, New Mexico. Very little is known about the
move to Ft Huachuca so we focused instead on Los Alamos but even here 
there is much less known about this facility than the "vault" system at 
WPAFB. Note: There were reported "alien" artifacts already at Los Alamos
before this reported move took place.

Fig. 1 (20k) shows the area adjacent to the Bandelier National Forest on
Rt. 4 (forest location & Los Alamos Nat'l. Lab shown on the map (16k)
circled in red). In Fig. 1 (20k) one can see a bunker. This bunker is
representative of the many bunkers that dot the side of this ridge and
valley area. Located just over the hill area where this bunker lies is 
a huge hangar bay door (not shown) according to a Ret. AF Lt. Col. Fig 2
(20k) shows Tech Area 33 entry way at Los Alamos. Also, See TA33
MapLink below for layout of TA33.

Note: The TA 33 Map does not show the reported road described here
which might, like at WPAFB or Area 51, was never put on a Map or it 
was removed from the Map.

The road (not shown) just west of this TA33 entry reportedly leads
in one direction off to the left and down to a huge bay door on the
bottom "south" ridge area according to this same AF Lt. Col. 
Through this bay door is said to be were many of the recovered 
"alien" artifacts were brought in. One example of this is when they
would try to bring recovered "saucers" through this bay door and 
more often than not they would have to "tilt" the recovered "saucer"
up on its side to get it through the door. This huge bay door entry
is said to lead to a multi level underground structure: Note, this
structure is not located in TA33: The entry just west of TA33 is 
the reported entry circa 1978.

Another underground complex is part of a greater complex called "Dulce" 
(this was the code name). The "Dulce Complex" , or Tech Area 53 is 
composed of sixty buildings: some are underground, some are revetments,
and some are bunkers. Badges with a color security system is in effect.
All this according to a key government source who had been there in 
circa 1978/79. His words to me: "You should have seen what I have seen."
The underground part of the facility is reportedly through a huge 
vaulted door: This Tech Area 53 lies about ~ 4 miles from the national
forest. This area also lies on the edge of the main LANL complex (see
map (20k) ). On the LANL URL map link below you will see that Tech Area
53 is labeled as the Meson Physics Tech Area: Reportedly, that's only 
what the main above ground complex is for.

     Note: In addition to the "Dulce Complex" there was a reported
     newer structure built in the late seventies that was described
     as a three story underground facility. This facility may or may
     not be physically connected to the "Dulce Complex." 

If, the big bay door entry represents the "back door" in this other 
Mesa complex next to the Bandelier forest then the "front door entry" 
is suspected to be back down the hill going in an easterly direction 
away from TA 33 along Rt. 4. At the bottom of this hill located in a 
canyon area is another controlled Tech Area: See LANL Map Link below. 
This Tech Area or the "Bay Door" entry just west of Tech Area 33 is 
reportedly connected to this Mesa complex next to the national forest:
This may or may not be connected to the "Dulce Complex" in area 53.

     Note: Recent information (08-08-96) has come along that seems
     to confirm some of what is written here: In one case a Ret
     Engineer states (2nd hand here) he worked on Disc simulators at 
     LANL in the early fifties. He is said to have stated that this 
     underground facility is under one of the Mesas and is accessed 
     from a side canyon. He also commented that large rooms had been
     blasted out of rock to the tune of being "football field sized." 
     But, he wouldn't say exactly where it was. Aside comment: This 
     sounds very much like the reported Complex lll description and
     perhaps the reported underground mountain facility in Area 53 or
     the stated Mesa Complex next to the national forest: See below
     for Complex lll. 
     
     Another tibit of information (3rd hand in this case) came
     from the retired head of security at LANL: He is quoted to have
     said that there was "ET stuff" at LANL and its presence was part
     of his biggest security problems. The problem wasn't the Soviets
     as it was teenaged LANL dependents who would go off into these
     canyons surrounded by the "Mesas" for the usual teenaged mischief.
     On a number of occasions he was quoted to have said that these 
     kids got dangerouly close to the access points of this facility.
     On a LANL map the community of White Rock is just northeast 
     and close to TA33 and TA39.
  
People who have worked in Tech Area 33 know about underground facilities
there (not related to this subject) but, are not apparently aware of just
whats behind that huge bay door which according to this same Ret. AF Lt.
Col. lies further down the ridge line. And, just like at WPAFB, Ohio, an
estimated 99+% of the people assigned to Los Alamos Labs don't know of 
the existence of this reported back entry huge "Bay Door."  Or, if they
knew of it they don't know what its used for -- or no "Need to Know."

According to our key government source another facility called Complex
lll or C lll is where the first reported EBE was kept. C lll or Complex
lll was also said to be the first underground facility built at Los 
Alamos in the very early fifties. According to reports, Complex lll was 
and still is the largest underground military facility in the world: 
It was built to withstand a direct five megaton nuclear explosion. The 
facility was built to continue nuclear research even after a war. It 
has a reported size of 10 football fields. It comes fully equipped 
with a series of rooms, research labs, and other necessities situated
~ 150 ft underground. 

Continuing; EBE-1 was said to have been kept in Complex lll until it 
reportedly died on June 18th, 1952 from an unknown illness. An old 
Army/Air Force brown shoe Ret. Col. who reportedly lived with EBE-1 for
three years from 1949 to 1952 lives in Phoenix, Arizona with his 
daughter at last reports. Eight years ago he was quoted to have said,
"There isn't day in my life that I don't think about this." But, he 
wouldn't talk to you unless you were "cleared." And since he has been
suffering with terminal cancer he may be deceased at this point. But, 
according to this same government source there was a 16 mm film history
made of those three years with EBE-1 and he saw a segment of it. That 
16 mm film was later transferred to video tape. In the original 16mm 
version it was said that in one scene EBE-1 was standing up on a box 
and our brown shoe Col had asked EBE-1 to turn around: EBE-1 then 
proceeded to turn around on the box: Source said it was pretty 
amazing ! It was reported that EBE-1's speciality was a mechanic.

Our chief scientist who heads the division within this facility six 
etc levels from the surface has reportedly been in this business for 
over forty years. His knowledge in this area is considered vast to say
the least. He has stated that he spends about 70% of his time on this 
subject and the remaining time on other technical or management 
problems. In February 1990 he said that some of our people have gone
to the "Zeta Reticuli Star System" and some of "theirs" have stayed 
with us.

Note: See URL: https://https://.qtm.net/~geibdan/news2/zeta.html

for further information on the Zeta Reticuli Star System.

But, under no circumstances will he come out into the open:
And will only talk to people who are "cleared." There have been 
reports that our chief scientist has a background in Astrophysics or
"Bio-Astrophysics." It has been estimated that this chief scientist 
was in his late twenties when he took over the program in circa 1953
to the chagrin of many of the more senior scientists.

Huachuca please see the following URLs:

As a casual remark in this brief report I wish to point out that the Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Vaulted Libraries, (TS/SCI
Libraries) on this subject have been reported to be at Sandia and Los
Alamos Labs, New Mexico, and the NSA facility at Ft Huachuca, Arizona. Some
material is still believed to be at the National Air Intelligence Center
(NAIC) WPAFB, Dayton, Ohio. And lastly, there is a reported TS/SCI vaulted
library in a government building near the "Mall" in Washington DC. This
facility was visited by one of our sources in August of 1995. Laying in the
floor area of one of the main entries to this building is a game board
called "King's Table." This board game is often referred to as the "Viking
Game" and dates back at least 1500 years. See URL:

     https://https://.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/kings_table.html

It might interest the reader to attempt to decipher the supposed
relationship between this board game and the suspected "alien" presence on
this planet and the games that get played. Hint, we strongly suspect there
is a relationship. The game looks basic and simple but we don't believe it
is: Just like real life games.

So, these are the details up to this point. Certain types of information
has been left out and other information is not available. If more details
do become available on locations and facilities we might want to be
cautious less some well intentioned but unwelcome people show-up there. 
The "Dulce" facility is assumed to be very active.

Finally, we are being told by Gov Intell Sources that for the disclosure
process "everything" is "set" and "in place," "ready to go." In fact, they
state that "it's already in motion." This report is certainly more
"speculative" than previous ones but, there is high confidence here in the
sources and data which have been shown to be right than before. We will attempt
in every way possible to keep the readers up to date -- but, only if they
don't expect "the world."
