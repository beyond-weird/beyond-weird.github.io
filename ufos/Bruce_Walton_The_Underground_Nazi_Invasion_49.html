 [PART 49] Eastern European Offensive. In mid-1942, "Operation Blue," the
German offensive in Eastern Europe, was succeeding brilliantly.

In mid-July of this year, Karl Brandt, Hitler's personal physician, and
Martin Bormann, Hitler's personal secretary, conducted a tour of the Soviet
Ukraine for the purpose of reviewing population demographics. Bormann
subse- quently stated to Hitler that "In view of the large families of the
native population, it could only suit us if girls and women there had as
many abortions as possible."[43]

Reichsfuhrer Adolf Hitler strongly agreed with this assessment, actually
incorporating Bormann's language;

"The Slavs are to work for us. Insofar as we don't need them they may die.
Therefore compulsory vaccination and education are super- fluous. The
fertility of the Slavs is undesirable. They may use contra- ceptives or
practice abortion -- the more the better.

"In view of the large families of the native population, it could only suit
us if girls and women there had as many abortions as possible. Active trade
in contraceptives ought to be actually encouraged in the Eastern
territories, as we could not possibly have the slightest interest in
increasing the non-Germanic population."[44]

On July 22, Brandt and Bormann proposed a restrictive population policy to
Hitler, and on the very next day, the Fuhrer approved it. The resulting
eight-paragraph secret order was, as one historian stated, "... perhaps the
most extreme policy statement ever issued from the Fuhrer-Hauptquartier
."[45]

The population control policy included a paragraph that paraphrased
Hitler's wording; "When girls and women in the Occupied Territories of the
East have abortions, we can only be in favor of it; in any case we should
not oppose it. The Fuhrer believes that we should authorize the development
of a thriving trade in contraceptives. We are not interested in seeing the
non-German population multiply."[46]

The Whole Package. A short April 27, 1942 statement by Berlin population
and demographics expert Professor Heinrich Wetzel (repro- duced below in
its entirety) summarized the entire Nazi population control program
regardless of location. Notice carefully the striking similarities this
program has to the one that has been implemented in the United States by
pro-abortion groups.

"Every propaganda means, especially the press, radio and movies, as well as
pamphlets, booklets, and lectures, must be used to instill in the Russian
population the idea that it is harmful to have several children. We must
emphasize the expenses that children cause, the good things that people
could have had with the money spent on them. We could also hint at the
dangerous effect of childbearing on a woman's health.

"Paralleling such propaganda, a large-scale campaign would be launched in
favor of contraceptive devices. A contraceptive industry must be
established. Neither the circulation and sale of contraceptives nor
abortions must be prosecuted.

"It will even be necessary to open special institutions for abortion, and
to train midwives and nurses for this purpose. The population will practice
abortion all the more willingly if these institutions are competently
operated. The doctors must be able to help out, in case there is any
question of this being a breach of their professional ethics. Voluntary
sterilization must also be recommended by propaganda." [47]

By this time, the Nazis recognized that personal and professional
consciences were often deeply troubled by the practice of widespread and
easily-available abortion. Heinrich Himmler soothed these troubled
consciences by issuing a decree in March of 1943 that is remarkably similar
to those promulgated by our own American Medical Association; "The Russian
physicians or the Russian Medical Association, which must not be informed
of this order, are to be told in individual cases that the pregnancy is
being interrupted for reasons of social distress."[48]

The Aftermath of Murder. After the war, the Nuremberg Trials brought most
of the Nazi war criminals involved in Germany's population control programs
to justice. (Others would fanatically argue this claim! - Wol.) Between
October of 1947 and March of 1948, the United States Military Tribunal
prosecuted the leadership of the RKFDV in its 'Case 8.' One of the charges
was that "Protection of the law was denied to the unborn children of the
Russian and Polish women in Nazi Germany. Abortions were encouraged and
even forced on these women."[49]

One of the RKFDV documents entered into evidence by the U.S. prosecution
stated that "It is known that racially inferior offspring of Eastern
workers and Poles is to be avoided if at all possible. Although pregnancy
interruptions ought to be carried out on a voluntary basis only, pressure
is to be applied in each of these cases." [50]

The Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal indicted and convicted ten Nazi leaders
for "encouraging and compelling abortions," an act which the Tribunal
characterized as "a crime against humanity." [50]

As with their other crimes against humanity, the Nazis protested that "we
were just following orders." Lieutenant General Richard Hilde- brandt, the
SS ( Schutzstaffel ) Chief of the RKFVD's Race and Settlement Office in
Berlin, stated that "Up to now nobody had the idea to see in this
interruption of pregnancy a crime against humanity." [50]

He was given a 25-year sentence.

Other officers of the RKFVD were meted sentences ranging from ten years for
Fritz Schwalm, a "Racial Examination Officer," to life imprisonment for
Ulrich Griefelt, the organization's Chief Executive Officer.[50]

Other evidence submitted into evidence included a July 13, 1943 German
military report referring to "an intensification of counter- measures"
against Ukrainians, including the "forcible abortion of pregnant
women."[51] Other women within the borders of Germany itself were forcibly
aborted as punishment for attempting to avoid forced labor in German
factories.[52]

When our "Nuremberg Trials" are held for United States abortion- ists and
euthanasiasts, exactly the same excuses will be given by those who have
committed latter-day crimes against preborn humanity.

The Genocide Treaty. With the atrocities of Nazism still fresh in the minds
of the world, international lawyers soon drafted the "Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," which defines genocide
as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
ethnical (ethnic), racial, or religious group."

(Like Margaret Sanger's deliberate targeting of non-'Aryan' races like the
blacks for 'elimination'. - Wol.)

Article II further defines genocide as "imposing measures intended to
prevent births within the group."[53]
