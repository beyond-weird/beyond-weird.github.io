I have never dared to tell this story before.

   First off, nobody would believe me, and second of all, how does one
go about coming to terms with a terror so unbelievably real that it
literally make the hair on your arm bristle, and your flesh crawl?

   The "Men in Black" - or "MIB" for short - have had this ominously evil
effect on dozens of other level-headed individuals.  But let me explain in
more detail for those not aware of the regin of terror that has gone on in
the UFO field, almost totally undetected for so many years.
   
   There are it would seem, at leased two different distinct types of MIB
that we must contend with.

   "Secret agents" posing as either Air Force or other authorized officials
have, from time to time, popped up in the annuals of ufology, prompting,
in the late 1960s, the Defense Deparment's Vice Chief of Staff, to issuse
a warning to all Branches of the service to be on the look out for
individuals impersonating Air Force officers.

   "In one reported case," the memorandum signed by Rewitt T. Wheless, Lt,
General, USAF, notes, "an individual who represented himself as a member
of NORAD, demanded and received photos belonging to a private citizen.  In
another, a person in an Air uniform approached local police and other
citizens who had sighted a UFO, assembled then in a school room and told
them that they did not see what they thought they saw and that they should
not talk to anyone about the sighting."

   In other instances, the MIB do not impersonate government officials, but
arrive seemingly out of thin air dressed in sinister black garb, only to
frighten the literal daylights out of those who have experienced a UFO
sighting, undergone a close encounter with aliens, or somehow stumbled
upon "hard evidence" that offers additional proof that a particular case
is legitimate.

   Often the MIB are said to be able to read the minds or control the
thoughts of those they set about to harass.  They can also tap telephones
lines, invade a person's dreams, interrupt the flow of mail, cause
hallucinations, and, in general, reek utter havoc on the lives of those
they seek to intimidate.  They have tried to run over witnesses, or have
driven them off the road, shot at those they are trying to "silence," and
even physically attacked certain individuals (if we are to believe the
more outlandish MIB stories that have spread throughout the field).

   Even the noted astronomer and foremost researcher, the late Dr. J.
Allen Hynek, did not discount these bizarre stories that were reaching him
as head of the Center for UFO Studies.  Hynek once noted in an interview:
"I have on occasion been told what seemed to be a straightforward story,
when suddenly the witness lapsed into a highly confidential mood and told
me that he was sure that his phone was being tapped or that he was being
watched, sometimes on a regular basis either by the government or by
occupants of the craft."

   Frequently, the Men in Black arrive upon the scene in a sinister looking
vehicle - most often time a black Cadillac with elongated fins - which
very often is an older model that for all intents and purposes looks
remarkably shiny and new.

   Few ufologists now doubt their existence.  There are those researchers
who say the MIB are agents sent by an earthly power...such as the CIA, or
even the notorious Russian KGB.  Others, upon close examination, rule out
such possibilities, insisting that because of their awkward appearance and
peculiar behavior, the MIB are somehow affiliated with the ETs themselves,
perhaps a sort of interplanetary Mafia that has been set up, and whose
primary purpose is to cover their trail in instances where a report is
likely to get too much attention, and the witnesses have to be SILENCED at
ALL cost!

                            THE MIB IN HISTORY

The terrorists of ufology have always been with us, their existence having
been well documented in reports the go back a hundred years or more.  In
1864, for example, a UFO dropped several strange artifacts over a small
Texas community.  The objects - of unknown origin - were picked up and
placed in a store window on the main street of town.  The very next day a
"stranger" dressed in a long black coat visited the shop keeper and
offered a "high price" for the objects.  But, because they did not belong
to him, the store owner said he did not have the right to sell the items. 
That night the store mysteriously caught fire and when the ashes and
rubble were sifted through, none of the artifacts could be found.  Nor was
the "stranger" ever seen again!

                               THE MODERN ERA

In more modern times researchers like John Keel, Timothy Green Beckley and
the late Gray Barker have done a credible job of documenting the
activities of the MIB.  In his now classic work THEY KNEW TOO MUCH ABOUT
FLYING SAUCERS, Barker told the story of Allen K. Bender, director of the
now defunct International Flying Saucer Bureau, an organization that
flourished in the early 1950s.

   During his investigation, Bender somehow stumbled upon the secret of
the saucers, how they were propelled, who flew in them, and where they
originated from.  He wrote to one of his many correspondents about his
findings, but instead of getting a reply through the mail, he was visited
shortly thereafter by three men dressed in black.  For several hours two
of the men drilled the researcher on the explanation for the UFO mystery.
while the third merely sat and carefully observed Bender.  The story they
gave was "fantastic" and extremely frightening, Bender later said, and it
portended great changes in all field of human endeavor, particularly in
science.  Before leaving, one of the MIB turned toward Bender and said,
"If we hear another word form your office you're in for BIG TROUBLE!"

   According to published accounts (see MIB - ALIENS AMONG US by Beckley),
Bender made a telephone call to a friend in which he casually mentioned
his theory and subsequent visitation of the three men.  Immediately after
hanging up, the phone rang.  A voice uttered that he knew of Bender's
conversation and that he had made a "bad slip" and warned him to stop his
activities RIGHT AWAY!

   The same day Bender suspended his organization's newsletter and refused
to talk about UFOs to his closest associates, his friends or even members
of his immediate family.  He was convinced that if he gave away the
"secret" something very terrible would happen to him and those around him.

  Other researchers have not been so lucky.  One Australian ufologist was
pushed down a flight of stairs in a large deparment store by seemingly
invisible hands, since there was no one near him at the time of his fall.

   In another episode which ended even more bleakly, two Army
investigators died when their military plane crashed.  At the time of the
"accident" they were reportedly in the process of carrying a briefcase
which contained metal from a UFO that had exploded off the coast of
Tacoma, Washington.  The incident in question included the appearance of
"secret agents," and even lead to an article in the TACOMA TIMES with the
intriguing headlines SABOTAGE HINTED IN CRASH OF ARMY BOMBER.  The
reporter who wrote the story, Paul Lance, claimed that a mysterious
telephone informer had called his office and indicated that the plane had
been "sabotaged or shot down to prevent shipment of the flying disc
fragments" to Hamilton Field.  "Lending sudstance to the caller's story,"
continued Lance's account, "is the fact that twelve hours before the Army
released official identification, he correctly identified the dead in the
crash...At McChord Field an intelligence officer confirmed the mystery
caller's report that the ill-fated craft had been carrying 'classified
material.'"

   There have been other cases where UFO witnesses have been kidnapped
right off the street, taken to some windowless MIB headquarters while
blindfolded, sometimes drugged, and threatened with physical harm if they
continued to talk about their experience.

   For just such a reason, Carrol Wayne Watts of Loco, Texas doesn't much
like to talk about his UFO experiences anymore after he went to the aid of
a motorist and was hit by a heavy object in the head while his back was
turned.  Watts claimed that that a space craft had landed on his property
several times, that he had gone onboard the craft, met the object's
occupants, and taken photographs to validate his story.  At first, he
freely talked to the press, but later refused to do so, after his house
was supposedly sprayed by machine-gun fire.

   Some researchers even point to the untimley deaths of certain ufologist
as the possible work of the Men in Black.  They see the reported
"suicides" of scientists like Dr. James McDonald and M.K. Jessup as being
related to the existence of the MIB.  They point to their belief that
these men were on the verge of some important breakthrough when their
breath was snuffed out.  Those more "careful" in their investigation of
such matters see these deaths as being unfortunate "coincidences."
