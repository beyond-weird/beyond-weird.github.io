        ARMY GETS AROUND TO CHECKING `FLYING DISC' AND IS MYSTIFIED

        
        WASHINGTON, July 3 (UP)- Army research experts can't explain the
" flying saucers" reported seen in several western states, but they are
investigating, they said.

        The Army air forces has checked all of their researc authorities
and contractors, but none of them knew or could sugest anything concrete
about the "saucers.

        At first, Army officers laughed off the reports. Now they are
beginning to take them at least a little seriously. At any rate, the Air
Research Center at Wright Field, O., is looking into the reports, and all
service intelligence agencies are at work on them.

        Army experts suggested-as a bare possibillity-that some civilian
inventer has been making experiments of some kind.

        The possibillity that the discs might be of foreign origin was
indirectly put forward by an A.A.F. spokesman who said:

        "If some foreign power is sending flying discs over the United
States, it is our responsibillity to know about it and take proper action."

        Meanwhile eight more names were added to the list of persons who
say they have seen strange objects in the sky.

        E. E. Unger, meteorologist in charge of the United States Weather
Bureau at Louisville, Ky., said today he saw one of the mysterious discs
objects last night when leaving a Louisville theater.

        In Boise, Lt. Governor Donald S. Whitehead revealed that last June
24, the day Keneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, said he saw speeding objects
wavering through the air along the slopes of Mount Rainer, he and Head
Justice of the Peace, J. M. Lampert observed a strange, comet-like object
hanging in the western sky.

        Dick Rankin, a former Portland (Ore.) flyer with more than 7000
hours air time, declared he saw the mysterious discs over Bakersfield,
Calif., going 300 to 400 miles an hour June 23.


                        ______________________________


        Now a comment from ****DON****,

        I find it interesting to note at this time the quoted witnesses are
not yet as Mr. Bill Moore phrased "two farmers along the Mississippi
river.." (I hope you don't mind me quoting you Mr. Moore), but are:

        a) E. E. Unger          United States Weather Bureau Meteorologists
        b) Donald S. Whitehead  Lt. Governor Boise, Idaho
        c) J. M. Lampert        Head Justice of the Peace
        d) Dick Rankin          A former flyer with 7000 hrs. flight time.

        It would seem to me that the meteorologist would have been able to
identify a "WEATHER BALLOON" if he had seen one. And it also would seem
dificult for a weather balloon to travel 300 to 400 miles an hour if it had
been a "WEATHER BALLOON" as stated by the pilot who again would seem to me
to be a reliable source as to the velocity of the object he saw. And of
course you have a Lt. Governor and a Head Justice of the Peace, hardly
incompetent sources.

        In later articles when "the Army and Navy began a concentrated
campaign to stop the rumors" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch 07-09-47 UP) the
citizens are told that hundreds of these weather balloons are sent aloft by
many organizations throught the U.S. each and evey day.

        The articles are there, look for them your self, seek and you will
find. Please look for them and post them also.
