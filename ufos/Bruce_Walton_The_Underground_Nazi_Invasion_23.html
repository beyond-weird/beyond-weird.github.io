 [PART 23]

(Terziski interview, continued...)

     V.T. - "...I have a feeling that the 'head-hunting' Delta Forces of 
the 2nd World War that were hunting for German scientists, rocket 
and other advanced scientists... I mean this is not the only time in 
history that such crack Illuminati forces had been scouting the planet 
for the most advanced research(ers) in any particular field.  I have 
a feeling that in the last several hundred years this has been one of 
the major social functions or anti-functions, basically to make sure 
that no important invention would get past their fringes and be imple-
mented in society.
     S.R. - O.K.... [Vladimir Trziski of] the 'American Academy of
Dissident Scientists', and actually we had Al Bielek on this program 
about 2 or 3 weeks ago, so we are in good company here with Vladimir 
then.  Is that correct, you are a co-founder with him of this group?
     V.T. - Yes, yes.
     S.R. - ...Excellent.  And so what does the 'Academy of Dissident 
Scientists' really seek to do?  
     V.T. - Well we seek to... (end of one tape, section of the conversation 
not recorded.  Continued on another tape. - Wol.)... first orbital station 
created in 1949 with antigravity propulsion.  Something that's right now... 
NASA is fighting to get more money again from Congress to do it for 
the public domain, for the mass circulation science, it had been done
half a century earlier for the secret government science...
     S.R. - Now along that line I'd like to ask a question about your 
knowledge of the Russian technologies.  It is said that the Russians 
are really a lot farther ahead than we are...
     V.T. - Not at all...
     S.r. - Technologically.
     V.T. - My feeling is that not only the French Revolution and the 
Paris Commune and the Communism of Marx and Engels was financed 
and masterminded and orchestrated by the Illuminati, but so was the 
Bolshevik Revolution, the Nazi uprising in Italy, or the National Socialist 
and Nazi movement in Germany.  And along that line, Wall Street has 
secretly been going to painstaking efforts to help behind-the-scenes 
the Russians in order for them to become a real strong external enemy 
and not to be just a 'paper bear', a flimsy paper bear.  I have numerous 
accounts of how the Germans built all the munitions plants, 14 out of 
15 munitions plants BEFORE the war started, the Second World War
started.  They were all built by Germans... Rolls Royce built the turbo-
jet factory for the MIG fighter plane engines, just in time for the beginning 
of the Korean war.  I have a photograph in my possession of the best 
(at the time? - Wol.) American strategic bomber, the B-29, the one that 
dropped the bomb over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Under it's wing there 
is hanging the best German twin-engine rocket interceptor, supersonic 
swept-wing rocket interceptor the DFS-346, and all of this under the 
red star markings of the Russian Air Force.  How can somebody claim
that there is not a secret siphoning of the most advanced technology 
behind-the-scenes... of the Cold War in order to make Russia the real 
enemy.  I've heard rumors that the Russians were given enriched uranium 
to build their first nuclear bomb, and when they couldn't do even that 
they were given a whole nuclear bomb that was smuggled out in the 
luggage of the Russian ambassador straight on a flight from Washington 
to Moscow according to the words of Victor Suvaro, the genius of the 
Russian Intelligence novels.  And basically those are documentary 
books that he has written.  The best of them is 'AQUARIUM', for any 
one of our listeners who would like to acquaint himself with the workings 
of a secret society.  Later on the Russians were sold a nuclear submarine 
in order to make their sagging strategic fleet a more real, threatening 
menace.  Why would the Illuminati need a strong enemy in the Russias?  
Very simple, because otherwise they cannot keep the secrecy around
these giant underground projects going on.  Now the best reason they 
use is 'Oh well, we cannot tell you about that, we cannot discuss this 
even in Congress because the Russians would know.'  It was cleverly 
used on both sides of the 'curtain' in order for the secret societies in 
both Russia and the United States to quietly engage in [and justify the
massive financing of] these projects.  Back to the Germans, the most
interesting claim that they are (making) in another documentary
film... available from us, is that they landed on Mars in mid-January 
1946 after 8 months of heavy flight with a basically volunteer suicide 
crew of Germans and Japanese in a giant 230 foot diameter dreadnaut... 
again running on free energy, basically the Hanz-Kohler converters of 
gravity energy into electromagnetic energy of the flight.  Another inter-
esting thing that I found is a whole range of mind control experiments
in Germany that were repeated verbatim by the super powers after
the war.  Mind control with ultrasound, when they were inducing and 
indoctrinating their crack S.S. troops, mind control with all kinds of 
synthetic hallucinogenic drugs, or all kinds of the 'proper' mushrooms, 
mind control that was developed using the Wilhelm Reichian technology.  
In the initial states this (involved) types of sodomic mind control that 
was practiced by certain of the Ahrimanic and Luciferian orders of 
Tibetan monks that were visited by these numerous German ethno-
graphic expeditions in the '20s and '30s, and all of this secret know-
ledge was later brought to Germany.  We produce a fascinating tape 
here with Al Bielek and T. Johnson from Las Vegas on the magical-
occult connections of the Third Reich, and we called the tape 'OCCULT
NATIONAL SHAMANISM' in analogy to 'National Socialism', a fasci-
nating tape that basically brings together about a dozen extremely 
rare books on the occult connections of the Third Reich, the dabblings 
with satanism, with witchcraft, with all kinds of unspeakable aberrations, 
including sexual aberrations... the Germans were in contact with half 
a dozen [malevolent] alien races in these big underground establish-
ments, some of these underground bases were 2 kilometers long, 
one kilometer wide.  I have found the drawings of the tunnel systems
with these bases from incredible places including...the American
Bombing Survey reports of underground...huge industrial establish-
ments under the German mountains... the bottom line is that by the 
time the war ended the Germans were VERY HEAVILY doing all 
these major parts of the ILLUMINATI secret technologies on the 
planet... Mind Control technologies, a whole dozen of mind-control... 
I mean we have a tape here on mind control that was going on in the 
German bases.  But the most important thing about their research 
was genetic engineering... Quite a well-known movie producer in 
southern California that produced one of the best known UFO docu-
mentaries that won a big award has mentioned to me in a private 
conversation that while researching for that film he saw in a military-
government archive a documentary, a silent documentary film about 
horrific genetic experiments on live human beings, I mean cutting of 
heads, dismembering, reassembling, human bodies from parts - all 
these frankensteinean experiments in the German genetic program... 
and finally the film culminated with footage of living, walking, breathing 
HYBRIDS between HUMANS and ANIMALS that were produced in 
German concentration camps half a century earlier.  The Reife [spl?]
microscope, the Royal Reife microscope which is rumored to be a 
Tesla scaler-wave microscope that has an extremely...high resolution 
power and can see many levels of complexity beyond the hierarchial 
level of the cell, was probably the magical key to the human genome 
kingdom, the microscope was discovered in the '20s in Berlin and 
probably gave the key to the Germans to the human genome.  The big 
10 billion dollar human genome project that is right now beginning to 
drain budget dollars run through the Dept. of Energy here, is nothing
but a smokescreen for the REAL mastery of the human genome half 
a century earlier by the Illuminati that are running computerated designs 
of clones and human beings and all that stuff in the underground labs. 
(Note: The 'genome project' may also be a 'cover' for the activity taking 
place in the trilateral facilities below Dulce, New Mexico; the Nevada
Test Site and the 'Luna' Base wherein genetic experimentation is 
reportedly being carried to it's theoretical limits.  So-called 'abductees'
claim that they have seen Nazi officers and 'aliens' working together on
aerial craft.  Whether the 'aliens' are from some other world or whether
they are genetically-fabricated clones developed by Nazi scientists or
whether both scenarios exist I cannot say for certain.  The most famous 
and one of the original 'abduction' experiences caused such a stir that 
a motion picture was made based upon the incident, called "THE INTER-
RUPTED JOURNEY".  According to the paranormal encyclopedia, 
"MYSTERIES OF MIND, SPACE & TIME", the well-known Betty and 
Barney Hill abduction of 1961 reportedly involved gray-skinned humanoids 
"from Zeta Reticuli".  HOWEVER, one of the "beings" on the craft was 
described by Barney Hill in the following quote which is taken from p.1379 
of the encyclopedia: "...another figure has an EVIL face... 'HE LOOKS 
LIKE A GERMAN NAZI.  HE'S A NAZI... HIS EYES!  HIS EYES.  I'VE 
NEVER SEEN EYES LIKE THAT BEFORE!" - Wol.)
     S.R. - Hmm.
     V.T. - I take very seriously films, not only films like 'BOYS FROM 
BRAZIL' about the secret experiments in 'education' of abducted children... 
the (secret) government has been the biggest consumer of abducted 
children in this country, and I called just on a hunch this Milk Carton 
1-800 number, chasing a rumor that 400,000 CHILDREN were missing 
from this country each year, (close to) half a million each year.  I thought 
'Nah, maybe 20, 30 thousand, it's not possible.'  And the lady there said... 
'No, we don't have ANY statistics.'  'Well, any newspaper articles, any-
thing?'  'No, no, we DON'T have anything.'  And I was beginning to get 
more and more suspicious.  Finally she made an 'educated' guess, 
having worked for 5 years in the system.  She said, 'About maybe 200,000 
children a year or so.'  Within only 5 minutes...research I did, I got half 
of the wildest rumor that I've heard of, half a million missing every year.  
Most of them disappear in the underground...of the New World Order...
     S.R. - That is amazing.  Well, we do have to pause right here... 
     (STATION BREAK)... 
     S.R. - Vladimir Trziski.  He is a UFO researcher.  He is a co-founder 
with Al Bielek of the 'American Academy of Dissident Scientists'.
     (Sam Russell takes a call at this point.  The question is in regards 
to Vladimir's professional background)
     V.T. - Well, I studied Physics and Engineering at Tokai University 
in Tokyo, I have a Bachelor Degree in Physics, and a Master Degree 
in Electronics Engineering.  I worked for four years at the Solar Energy 
Research Institute for the Bulgarian Academy of Science before immigrat-
ing to the United States.  I studied for 3 and a half, 4 years, Sociology 
at Arizona State University, and at UCLA, and I'm slowly dragging this 
additional Degree of mine to a completion these days...
     S.R. - ...Well, O.K., let us move along and pick up on what you 
were talking about as we broke right there.  This having to do with the 
genetic cloning and so on.
     V.T. - I have two more items, basically very important items to 
finish and then we can to into the general discussions.  To cap off the 
whole genetic research effort on the planet, it is not an idea of a few 
crazy frankensteinian scientists here and there in the secret underground 
bases, it is not a crazy idea by the secret government or even by some 
high levels of alien races that are using us as convenient guinea pigs... 
It is a much higher level of 'party line' agenda coming, my feeling is, 
from the... basically the fallen angelic presence on our planet that
has been masterminding (the conspiracy)... probably 90% of the alien 
races that have visited our planet...most of them have been coming here 
on the planet sub-contracting for that particular branch of the 'celestial 
management' and the biggest point on their agenda is...the creation of life 
(or rather re-creation or re-arrangement of existing biological matter, since 
created beings whether standing or or fallen can only RE-STRUCTURE 
what has already been created. - Wol) on top of advanced interstell
