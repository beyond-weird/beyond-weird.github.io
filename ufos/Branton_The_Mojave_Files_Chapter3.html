"This letter is in reply to your January 31 letter. Please forgive me for
not answering sooner. Enclosed is some material I hope that you can glean
something of value (from). Please be as candid as you have been in the past
and if I am far off base don't hesitate to tell me...

"Our foundation has located a vast system of underground passages in the
Mother Lode country of California. They were first discovered in 1936,
ignored by all even with our best efforts to reveal them. Recently a road
crew blasted out an opening verifying our claims. ONE (of the chambers is)
200 feet long, 70 feet wide and 50 feet high. We have disclosed what we
believe to be a vast subterranean drainage system (probably traversing the
Great American Desert country for a distance of more than 600 miles). We
believe this system extends out like five fingers of your hand to such
landmarks as Zion Canyon in Utah, the Grand Canyon, another runs south from
the Carson Sink in Nevada and yet another follows (below) the western slope
of the same range, joining it's counterpart and ending somewhere in the
Mojave Desert. We believe, contrary to orthodox geologists, that the
existence of this underground system drains all surface waters running into
Nevada (none, with the exception of the Armagosa runs out) and accounts for
the fact that it is a Great American Desert. The hairy creatures that you
have written about have been seen in several of these areas. Certainly
there has been much 'saucer' activity in these parts. For two years I have
collected material pertinent to these creatures and if you have any
opinions along these lines I would appreciate hearing them.

"So much for now. I hope that I am still your friend. Much of my time has
been devoted (to) helping a farmer near Portland who has made a fantastic
discovery of incredible stone artifacts. He has several tons of them. They
predate anything yet found (or accepted), let us say that for now. We are
making slow but steady progress in getting through the wall of orthodoxy. -
Chuck Edwards."

Several years ago, subsurface researcher Richard Toronto reprinted a news
article in his SHAVERTRON newsletter describing a Municipal Water Director
in Los Angeles. This official talked with a man who said that he was hired
by the government to look for underground water sources for Camp Irwin in
California.

At one point the man and a partner came across an abandoned mine and
decided to follow it to the bottom. Near the bottom he was surprised to
discover an ancient earth-fault which was wide enough for him and his
companion to enter. They traversed this fault for a good distance until
they finally emerged into a huge river-cavern. To his surprise he saw
before him a crystal pure underground river over a quarter of a mile wide
which flowed through the passage and out of sight.

Since learning of this incident the Municipal Water Director claims to have
'discovered' at least five similar underground rivers. Some of these have
allegedly been die-traced and were found to emerge from the continental
slope below the surface of the oceans, and at least one of them into the
Gulf of California.

This might confirm the allegations made by one anonymous retired Navy
officer that the Navy has knowledge of a VAST system or labyrinth of
aqua-caverns which meander beneath the surface of California and even into
other western states, and that these watery labyrinths exit out into the
oceans via huge entrances in the lower walls of the Continental Slope. One
of the more extravagant claims is that some of these aqua-caverns are so
large that they can be navigated by submarine, and that one nuclear
submarine on a secret mapping mission in fact became lost within the maze
and was never heard from again. Two American nuclear submarines have
disappeared without explanation in the past, the U.S.S. SCORPION and the
U.S.S. THRESHER. It is true that one woman who claimed to have had a very
strong emotional bond with her husband who worked on the Thresher, insisted
at the time that she just 'knew' that her husband was still alive after the
'disaster'. She said that she and her husband had such a
spiritual-emotional connection that they always knew when the other was in
trouble (For information on the Navy's investigations of the
aqua-labyrinths via nuclear subs, etc., see: 'CALIFORNIA FLOATS ON OCEAN?';
article in the March, 1980 issue of John J. Williams' "REBEL MAGAZINE",
which at the time was available from: Consumertronics Co., c/o John J.
Williams. Pres., 2011 Crescent Dr., P.O. Drawer 537., Alamogardo, NM
88310). The 'Thresher' incidentally 'disappeared' on April 10, 1963 with a
crew of 129 men under the command of John W. Harvey, USN.)

Researchers Will Carson and Jeannie Joy interviewed the woman mentioned
above shortly after the disappearance. She said:

"...My husband was on the submarine Thresher when it disappeared. I don't
consider myself a widow. I don't believe my husband is dead. No, it's not a
matter of just not being able to believe it, to accept reality; I just
can't get over the conviction that he's still alive somewhere. I love my
husband very much. I know he loved -- loves me. We were very close. We
could always tell when something was wrong with each other. Intuition, I
guess. I should have felt something the instant there was trouble, if he
was really in serious trouble and knew it -- a matter of life and death --
but I didn't."

"What do you believe really happened?" Carson and Joy asked the attractive
young woman.

"Most people think I'm crazy when I say this, but I believe the Thresher
was captured."

"By whom?"

"I can't say for sure, but there WAS a Russian submarine spotted near there
that day (that is, near where it REPORTEDLY vanished 220 miles off Boston
harbor) -- only I can't imagine how even the Russians could CAPTURE a
vessel like the Thresher without leaving the slightest evidence!"

John J. Williams' source, the retired Navy officer (whose credentials
Williams verified), stated that "an eccentric billionaire" (Howard
Hughes!?) financed the false Thresher "recovery operation" to satisfy the
public and the media.

Still more revelations concerning the Mojave subnet can be found in Bourke
Lee's book 'DEATH VALLEY MEN' (MacMillan Co., N.Y. 1932).

In his chapter: 'Old Gold', Lee describes a conversation which he had
several years ago with a small group of Death Valley explorers. The
conversation had eventually turned to the subject of Paihute Indian
legends. At one point two of the men, Jack and Bill, described their
experience with an 'underground city' which they claimed to have discovered
after one of them had fallen through the bottom of an old mine shaft near
Wingate Pass. They found themselves in a natural underground cavern which
they claimed they followed for about 20 miles north into the heart of the
Panamint Mountains. To their amazement, they claimed, they found themselves
in an huge, ancient, underground cavern city. This account will be quoted
later on, however in addition to this, Lee recorded yet another story of a
Paihute Indian (not the same one referred to by Oga Make) who may have
stumbled into the 'deeper' underground kingdom of the ancient race who
built the city within the Panamints, a civilization that was still alive
and thriving after thousands of years.

During this lengthy conversation wherein they first revealed the secret of
the underground city to Lee and others, the discussion turned to the topic
of a Paihute Indian legend that they had heard which was remarkably similar
to an ancient GRECIAN myth. The Paihute legend concerned a tribal chief
whose wife had died, and who according to the tradition took a spiritual
journey to the underworld to find her, and upon returning with her he
'looked back' and since this was forbidden he was not allowed to bring his
wife back with him from the dead.

This legend would not be in the same vein as the more tangible story
related earlier in the File, as told by the Navaho Oga-Make, concerning a
Paihute chief who was allegedly PHYSICALLY taken into the underground
cities of the Hav- musuvs deep below the Panamints. After this legend was
referred to, the conversation turned to a discussion of an alleged
subterranean race, who were believed to inhabit very deep caverns far below
the Death Valley territory. Paihute legends of the 'Hav-musuvs' indicate
that these ancient dwellers of the Panamints abandoned the ancient city
within the mountain itself and migrated to still deeper and larger caverns
below. Could the following story tie-in with the Paihute legends of the
Hav-musuvs? We will enter the conversation with the following discourse
from Bourke Lee:

"...The professor and Jack and Bill sat in the little canvas house in
Emigrant Canyon and heard the legend all the way through. The professor
said, 'That story, in its essentials, is the story of Orpheus and
Eurydice.'

"'Yes,' I said. 'It's also a Paiute legend. Some Indians told that legend
to John Wesley Powell in the sixties.'

"'That's very interesting,' said the professor. 'It's so close a parallel
to Orpheus and Eurydice that the story might well have been lifted bodily
from the Greeks.'

"Jack said, 'I wouldn't be surprised. I knew a Greek. I forgot his name,
but he ran a restaurant in almost every mining town I ever was in. He was
an extensive wanderer. The Greeks are great travelers.'

"Bill said, 'They don't mean restaurant Greeks. The Greeks they're talken
about have been dead for thousands of years.'

"'What of it?' asked Jack, 'maybe the early Greeks was great travelers,
too.'

"The professor said, 'It's very interesting.'

"'Now! About that tunnel,' said Bill, with his forehead wrapped in a frown.
'You said this Indian went through a tunnel into a strange country, didn't
you?'

"'Yes,' I said. 'I think I called it a cave or a cavern, but I suppose a
miner would call it a tunnel. Why?'

"'Here's a funny thing,' said Bill. 'This Indian trapper livin right across
the canyon has a story about a tunnel, an it's not a thousand years old
either. Tom Wilson told me that his grandfather went through this tunnel
and disappeared. He was gone three years, an when he came back he said he'd
been in a strange country livin among strange people. That tunnel is
supposed to be somewhere in the Panamints not awful far from where we're
sitten. Now! What do you make of that?'

"Jack said, 'I think Tom's grandfather was an awful liar.'

"I said, 'Tom's grandfather lived when the Paiutes were keeping their
tribal lore alive. He probably knew the old legend. Powell heard it in
Nevada only sixty-five years ago.'

"'It's very interesting,' said the professor.

"'I got an idea about it,' said Bill, thoughtfully. 'Tom's grandfather
might have wandered into some tunnel all goofy from chewen jimson weed and
then come out an found some early whites an stayed with them. Tom told me
that the people spoke a queer language and ate food that was new to his
grandfather an wore leather clothes. They had horses and they had gold. It
might have been a party in Panamint Valley, or even early explorers or
early settlers in Owens Valley. How about that?'

"Jack said, 'Yeah. The Spaniards was in here, too. So it might have been
Spaniards or the early Greeks. And, where is this tunnel? And why did Tom's
grandfather have trouble speaking the language? This is an entirely
different story than the one Buck told. We are arriving at no place at all
with these Indians and Greeks... To return for a moment to our discussion
of geology, professor; have you been in Nevada much?'"

From here the conversation took off in an entirely new direction...

Not only human 'UFOnauts' have been encountered in the Mojave Desert
region, but the so-called GRAYS as well. Is it possible that the GRAYS had
their genesis on planet earth thousands of years ago the 'Nordics'
apparently did? This is the opinion of researcher Brad Steiger who is
convinced that the GRAYS are actually descended from a mutation of the
saurian race which mysteriously 'disappeared' from the earth, therefore
giving rise to the theory that they became 'extinct' in spite of the fact
that other saurians like the crocodiles, alligators and iguanas continued
to survive.

In 1967, UFO researcher Brad Steiger co-authored (with Joan Whritenour -
later Joan O'Connell) a book titled: FLYING SAUCERS ARE HOSTILE. Regarding
the intentions of many of the occupants behind the phenomena, Steiger and
Whritenour stated:

     "...Certain saucer cultists, who have been expecting space
     brethren to bring along some pie in the sky, continue to deliver
     saucer-inspired sermons on the theme that the saucers come to
     bring starry salvation to a troubled world. The self-appointed
     ministers who preach this extraordinary brand of evangelism
     ignore the fact that not ALL 'saucers' can be considered
     friendly. Many give evidence of hostile actions. There is a
     wealth of well-documented evidence that UFO's have been
     responsible for murders, assaults, burning by direct-ray focus,
     radiation sickness, kidnappings, pursuits of automobiles, attacks
     on homes, disruption of power sources, paralysis, mysterious
     cremations, and destructions of aircraft. Dozens of reputable
     eye-witnesses claim to have seen alien personnel loading their
     space vehicles with specimens from earth, including animals, soil
     and rocks, water, and struggling human beings."

Steiger (who also authored the books: FLYING SAUCER INVASION - TARGET
EARTH, and THE FLYING SAUCER MENACE, as well as several others) also
believed that the entities most often encountered are not only hostile, as
indicated by the above quote, but non-human and in fact REPTILIAN or
SAURIAN in nature. In relation to this, there is the following statement
which was recently made by Steiger in his popular video film "THE TRUTH
ABOUT UFO'S". Steiger has, to some extent (in his video) "changed his tune"
concerning the nature of these reptilian beings - supposing now that they
aren't as evil as he made them out to be in earlier years. However, the
facts just don't support this conclusion, and the only explanation which we
can offer to this change of attitude would be the fact (as mentioned by a
number of sources) that these creatures have the ability to manipulate from
a distance the minds, emotions and spirits of humans through
occult-technological or psycho- supernatural means, and that they would
undoubtedly use this power to de-sensitize humanity to their actual nature.
It may also be that Steiger succumbed to the pressure of the many New Age
"Aquarians" with whom he interacts, who trust in "channeled" revelations
which usually portray the Grays as benevolent "space- brothers" who are
here to help establish a quantum evolutionary transformation and cosmic
initiation into the fourth dimension of universal New Age
god-consciousness, whatever that means. Certainly, if the true nature of
the serpent races were widely known, their operations and even their very
existence might be threatened. There are some who believe that the many
movies, animated programs, etc., which depict reptilian-like 'alien' beings
in a 'benevolent' fashion - are de-sensitizing America's young people away
from their natural enmity toward these ancient, though elusive, enemies of
mankind. Steiger, who is considered one of the foremost writers on UFO's
and related subjects, said the following:

     "In the late 1960's I presented my hypothesis that the reason why
     the most frequently reported UFOnauts resemble REPTILIAN or
     AMPHIBIAN humanoids may be because that is exactly what they are,
     highly evolved members of a serpentine or semi-aquatic species. A
     provocative theory is that the dinosaurs didn't really vanish,
     they 'evolved' into a humanoid creature that eventually ran it's
     course, or was destroyed in an Atlantis-type catastrophe (i.e.
     such as the Great Deluge. Although Steiger and others may hold to
     an 'evolutionary' hypothesis, this may not necessarily be the
     case, especially when the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and the laws
     of entropy are brought to bear. Instead of 'evolving' from a far
     less complex form, it is in fact far more likely that the serpent
     race MUTATED via natural selection, environmental adaptation,
     survival of the fittest and most intelligent, and so on, into
     it's various known and unknown branches, from a complex single
     species which originally inhabited the earth in ancient times.
     There is a BIG difference between the scientific fact of LATERAL
     MUTATION and the Darwinian theory of ASCENDING EVOLUTION -
     Branton).

     "...I had developed this hypothesis considerably," Steiger
     continues, "...so I was delighted when I received word that Dale
     Russell and Ron Seguen of Canada's 'National Museum of Natural
     Sciences' of Ottawa, had fashioned a model of a humanoid dinosaur
     using Stenonychosaurus and Equallus as their inspiration.
     Stenonychosaurus, according to Russell, had a rather large brain
     and eyes with over-lapping visual fields. The 90 pound dinosaur
     also walked on two legs, and it appears to have had a
     particularly OPPOSABLE THUMB on it's three-clawed hand. The
     result of such scientific speculation was an astonishingly
     human-like creature that Russell terms a 'Dinosauroid'. The
     creature stands four-and-a-half feet tall, has a large, domed
     head, green skin, and yellow reptilian eyes. It should probably
     have had ears, Russell conceded, but the effect would have made
     it appear too human. As it is, the dinosaur on display at
     Canada's 'National Museum of Natural Sciences' almost EXACTLY
     fits the descriptions of UFOnauts provided by THOUSANDS of men
     and women throughout the planet who have reported close
     encounters..."

In his book 'THE UFO ABDUCTORS' (1988., Berkley Books., N.Y.), pp 5-6,
Steiger adds: "In the greatest number of alien encounters, the UFOnauts
were described as standing about five feet tall and dressed in one-piece,
tight-fitting jumpsuits. Their skin was gray, or grayish-green, and
hairless. Their faces were dominated by large eyes, VERY OFTEN WITH
SNAKELIKE, SLIT PUPILS. They had no discernible lips, just straight lines
for mouths. They seldom were described as having noses, just little snubs
if at all; but usually the witnesses saw only nostrils nearly flush against
the smooth face. Sometimes a percipient mentioned pointed ears but on many
occasions commented on the absence of noticeable ears on the large, round
head. And, REPEATEDLY, WITNESSES DESCRIBED AN INSIGNIA OF A FLYING SERPENT
ON A SHOULDER PATCH, A BADGE, A MEDALLION, OR A HELMET."

The annual "NEVADA AERIAL RESEARCH JOURNAL" for Summer, 1989 confirmed Mr.
Steiger's claims by re-printing a UPI news item which appeared in a
Berkley, California newspaper. The article stated:

     "Dale Russell, curator of fossil vertebrates at the National
     Museums of Canada in Ottawa, has developed a theory that
     intelligent life forms could have developed from the large
     reptiles that roamed the earth (in ancient times).

     "Russell calls his imaginary creature a 'Dinosauroid' which would
     look like a hairless, green-skinned reptile with a bulging skull,
     luminous cat-like eyes and three-fingered hands...

     "The amphibians evolved into a humanoid species that eventually
     developed a culture that ran its course or was destroyed in an
     Atlantis-like catastrophe -- just after they had begun exploring
     extraterrestrial frontiers. Certain UFOnauts, then, may be the
     descendants of the survivors of that amphibian culture RETURNING
     from their space colony to monitor the present dominant species
     on the HOME planet."

This is one possibility which was given in the article. According to
certain sources the 'winged serpent' that is emblemed on the 'alien'
uniforms represents another reptilian mutation which is near the very top
of the alien or reptilian hierarchy, entities which have been referred as
the pterodactoids, the mothmen, or the winged draco. These have allegedly
been seen on rare occasions and have even been the subject of an entire
book by UFO researcher John A. Keel.

Further confirmation comes from the 4-part documentary 'DINOSAUR', hosted
by Walter Cronkite. This program also described the possibility that
certain groups of ancient saurians may have developed or mutated into
hominoid sauroids. David Norman, in a review of the series, stated:

     "...The series finishes with an unusual flourish. In 1982 Dr.
     Dale Russel of the Royal Museum of Canada, Ottawa indulged in a
     half-serious thought experiment. He had described a small, HIGHLY
     PREDATORY, nimble troodont dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous,
     STENONYCHOSAURUS, which had AN UNUSUALLY LARGE BRAIN, large
     stereoscopic eyes, and grasping hands. He speculated about what
     might have happened to such dinosaurs if they had not become
     extinct. His answer was the 'dinosauroid' - a three-clawed,
     three-toed, large-brained, UPRIGHT, and TAILLESS dinosaur."

Norman also described the almost human-like quality of the hand of one
particular saurian branch, the Iquanodon: "...The flexible fifth finger
moves a bit like a human thumb for grasping objects, while the middle three
fingers are capable of little flexure. The large, stiletto-like thumb spike
of Iguanodon would have been a devastating weapon. The sharp spike, coupled
with the strength of the forelimb, could have punctured the toughest skin."

It is possible that if such a highly intelligent yet (according to many
accounts) extremely insidious and predatory 'race' does in fact exist, then
it might NOT have 'mutated' far from it's original form as it is 'pictured'
-- although in a rather obscure fashion -- in the 3rd chapter of Genesis.
If we are to believe the thousands of witnesses who have reported such
creatures during UFO encounters (descriptions which would either be the
result of a collective hoax, mass hallucination, or observation of actual
encounters - the latter of which seems to be the most likely), then one
could reasonably ask the question: "Where do they originate from?" If they
had their origin on earth as Brad Steiger suggests, then where on earth are
the infernal creatures? A better question might be "Where IN earth are the
infernal creatures?" Although the 'serpent race' has largely succeeded in
evading the scrutiny of most humans living on the surface of this planet
over the centuries, there are many indications which nevertheless suggest a
SUBTERRANEAN connection -- not only to a large percentage of the UFO
phenomena, but also to many of the creatures which lie behind the phenomena
as well, especially the REPTILIAN creatures such as those described by
Steiger.

Believe it or not, there ARE in fact many more very well documented
accounts concerning alien, non-human 'entities' -- aside from the one's
mentioned earlier -- which have been encountered in underground recesses
throughout the world. Traditional Judeo-Christianity has more-or-less
associated the depths of the earth with 'Hades' and 'demons'. We are
certainly not denying this, but we are offering a much more elaborated
exposition of this concept.

Before describing these, however, we will document some cases of reptilian
hominoids which have been encountered on the SURFACE of the planet. The
following accounts, which appear in 'CURIOUS ENCOUNTERS', by Loren Coleman
(Faber & Faber., Boston, Mass. 1985) pp. 70-76, describe encounters with
reptilian and/or amphibian bi-pedial creatures of a semi-aquatic nature:

"In 1973, during the summer, residents of New Jersey's Newton-Lafayette
area described A GIANT, MAN-LIKE ALLIGATOR they had seen locally. Newspaper
reporters wrote about an old Indian tale from the region that told of a
giant, man- sized fish that could never be caught. In 1977, New York State
Conservation Naturalist Alfred Hulstruck reported that the state's Southern
Tier had 'a scaled, man-like creature (that) appears at dusk from the red,
algae-ridden waters to forage among the fern and moss-covered uplands.'

"The New York-New Jersey record, however, cannot compare with the
overwhelming series of narratives issuing from one place in the United
States, the Ohio River Valley.

"Over twenty years ago, by digging into the back issues of the Louisville,
Kentucky, COURIER-JOURNAL, I discovered one of those gems that has kept me
pondering its meaning for two decades. The interesting little item was in
the 24 October 1878 issue. A 'WIld Man of the Woods' was captured,
supposedly, in Tennessee, and then placed on exhibit in Louisville. The
creature was described as being six feet, five inches tall, and having eyes
twice the normal size. His body was 'COVERED WITH SCALES.' This article now
makes some sense.

"And then almost a hundred years later, again near Louisville, there are
more stories of REPTILIAN ENTITIES. In October 1975, near Milton, Kentucky,
Clarence Cable reported a 'giant lizard' was roaming the forests near his
junkyard. Author Peter Guttilla described the creature Cable surprised as
'about fifteen feet long, had a foot-long forked tongue, and big eyes that
bulged something like a frog's. It was dull-white with black-and-white
stripes across its body with quarter-size speckles over it.'

"On-site field investigations by Mark A. Hall, however, indicated this
'giant lizard' RAN BIPEDALLY, according to OTHER Trimble County, Kentucky
witnesses. The Ohio River is Louisville's, Milton's, and Trimble county's
northern boundary...

"1972... In March of that year on two separate occasions, two Ohio
policemen saw what has become known as the 'Loveland Frogman.' Investigated
by Ron Schaffner and Richard Mackey, these researchers interviewed the
officers involved but have not published their names, instead using the
fictitious names 'Williams' and 'Johnson.'

"The first incident took place at 1:00 A.M. on 3 March 1972, on a clear,
cold night. Officer Williams was on route to Loveland, via Riverside Road,
when he thought he saw a dog beside the road. But when the 'thing' stood
up, its eyes illuminated by the car lights looked at him for an instant,
turned, and leapt over the guardrail. Williams saw it go down an embankment
into the Little Miami River, a mere fifteen or so miles from the Ohio
River. He described the thing as weighing about sixty pounds, about three
to four feet tall, having a textured leathery skin, AND A FACE LIKE A FROG
OR LIZARD. Williams went on to the police station and returned with Officer
Johnson to look for evidence of the creature. They turned up scrape-marks
leading down the side of the small hill near the river.

"On approximately 17 March 1972, Officer Johnson was driving outside of
Loveland when he had a similar experience. Seeing an animal lying in the
middle of the road, he stopped to remove what he thought was a dead
critter. Instead, when the officer opened his squeaky car door, the animal
got up into a crouched position like a football player. The creature
hobbled to the guardrail and lifted its leg over, while constantly looking
at Johnson. Perhaps it was the funny smirk on its face, but Johnson decided
to shoot at it. He missed, he figured, since the thing didn't slow down.
Johnson later told how he felt it was more upright than the way Williams
described it. One area farmer told investigators he saw a large, FROG-LIKE
OR LIZARD-LIKE CREATURE during the same month of the officers'
sightings..."

Charles Berlitz, in his 'WORLD OF THE INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE' (Fawcett Crest
Books., N.Y.), related the following incident concerning another hominoid
predator or 'Lizard Man':

"There have been numerous Bigfoot sightings in the United States and around
the world. The humanlike creatures are usually said to be large and hairy
with glowing eyes. During the summer of 1988, however, residents of
Bishopville, South Carolina, reported accounts of a rare breed of Bigfoot:
A SEVEN- FOOT-TALL LIZARD MAN WITH GREEN SCALY SKIN. According to
witnesses, unlike other Bigfoot creatures Lizard Man has only three toes on
each foot, as well as long apelike arms that end in three fingers tipped
with FOUR-INCH CLAWS. Only the second Bigfoot to have only three fingers on
each hand, and the first (known to Berlitz - Branton) to also have three
toes on each foot. Lizard Man is the most unusual Bigfoot ever reported.

"Seventeen-year-old Chris Davis first encountered Lizard Man around 2:00
A.M. on June 29. On his way home, the teen stopped near the brackish waters
of Scape Ore Swamp outside Bishopville to change a flat tire. While
replacing the jack in the car's trunk, he glimpsed something running across
the field toward him. Jumping into his 1976 Toyota Celica, he was quickly
engaged in a tug-of-war with the reptilian creature as he tried to pull the
door closed. Then Lizard Man jumped onto the car's roof, where he left
scratches in the paint as evidence of his attack.

"Hysterical, Davis returned home and told only his parents and a few close
friends about the experience. Law enforcement officers, however,
interrogated him after neighbors said the boy might know something about
the strange bite marks and scratches found on another car.

"Davis wasn't alone in his report. Soon other reports were flooding the
sheriff's office. Teenagers Rodney Nolfe and Shane Stokes, for example,
were driving near the swamp with their girlfriends when Lizard Man darted
across the road in front of their car. Construction worker George Holloman
also claimed Lizard Man jumped at him as he was collecting water from an
artesian well.

"Investigating the area around the swamp, state trooper Mike Hodge and Lee
County deputy sheriff Wayne Atkinson found three crumbled, forty-gallon
cardboard drums. The tops of saplings were ripped off eight feet above the
ground. And there were, according to Hodge, 'humongous footprints,'
fourteen-by- seven-inch impressions in hard red clay. Following the tracks
for four hundred yards, the officers backtracked and found new prints
impressed in their car's tire tracks. According to state wildlife
biologists, the footprints matched no known animal species." (This 'Lizard
Man' incident was covered in one of the episodes of Tim White's 'SIGHTINGS'
documentary, - 'MONSTERS' segment, on the Fox Network - Branton).

Some sources have indicated that these Reptons or 'Lizard Like' beings,
similar to those described above, have been seen in deep underground tunnel
networks below the general southwestern areas of Albuquerque (especially
Dulce and San Crystobel), New Mexico; Las Vegas (especially Groom Lake),
Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; and within caves in the Black Mountains
between Las Vegas, Nevada and Kingman, Arizona -- among other areas. These
creatures have also been encountered, sources allege, in deep underground
installations below the Mojave Desert region of California... and even on
the fringe of the desert itself near Lancaster and elsewhere. In many cases
they have been seen working closely with the 'Grays', which regard these
Reptons or 'Lizard Men' as being their superiors.

Researcher Michael Lindemann of the '20/20 GROUP' related the following in
a public lecture in Lancaster, California, concerning a woman who had
experienced an 'abduction' by the alien group known as the Greys, on the
outskirts of the Mojave Desert:

     "...Lot's of ordinary citizens in the Lancaster area...are having
     close-up alien encounters... the first one is a woman with a
     number of children who in 1972 was living with her then husband
     in Ridgecrest, California... This woman had never read any books
     about UFO's or aliens, and didn't have any interest in it. Indeed
     today she has not read any books. The first thing she tried to do
     recently when she realized that she had had alien encounters, was
     she went out and rented Whitley Strieber's movie 'COMMUNION', the
     video tape, and she stuck it in the machine and barely a minute
     into the movie she got very anxious and nauseous and ran out of
     the house. That was her only attempt to inform herself on, let's
     say, literature or information about aliens, and yet this woman
     has had astonishing experiences."

Following an entirely waking experience where she saw a seemingly
half-physical or apparitional 'Grey', near her home which faced the open
desert (the nearest neighbor being about two blocks away), she began having
more intense experiences which she knew took place - but could not entirely
understand or recall. She described the creature in the traditional 'gray'
configuration described by so many other 'abductees' -- short gray with a
large head and large black slanted eyes -- which in light of her ignorance
of the overall UFO phenomena, according to Lindemann, only tends to
substantiate her story. As a result of this initial experience, Lindemann
explains, she contacted a hypnotherapist, a woman who incidentally had
never read a UFO book herself. This psychologist concluded -- through
various tests and observations -- that the woman from Ridgecrest was
entirely sane and sincere. Michael Lindemann continues:

     "...This woman has had lots and lots of experiences since then.
     Her next experience was also a waking experience which TURNED
     INTO an experience that she could not remember except through
     regression. But the 'waking' part of it was the 'clue' that she
     needed to start exploring her hidden memories.

     "Her husband went off on a training program, he worked for a
     telephone company, (and) went off on a training program for a
     number of weeks some time later, toward the end of 1972.

     "She was staying at home with her children. Of course because
     they were in an isolated spot, she slept in her bed with a loaded
     shotgun, and she was a very light sleeper, kind of nervous.

     "One night she woke up because there was 'rustling' in her room.
     She looked and she saw what she thought was a sort of hooded,
     black figure over by her dresser. It looked as if somebody were
     sort of 'playing' with her jewelry box. And she of course felt as
     if someone had probably broken into the house.

     "But as she was kind of thinking to herself, 'What can I do, what
     can I do,' kind of gripping her shot gun, she made a little
     involuntary gasp, and whoever it was turned around and walked
     over to her.

     "She described this being as about...4 1/2 feet tall, very, very
     dark, with very... she said it looked like a lizard! Very rough
     skin, big yellow eyes...not the huge black almond shaped
     eyes...large, yellow with a slit iris, a muzzle, teeth. She said
     it looked like an iguana. And she said that IMMEDIATELY she could
     tell that this being was very menacing and didn't like her at
     all. This being was dangerous and nasty, and not to be trusted.

     "She didn't remember what happened next, all she knew was she was
     terrified, because this being was literally leaning right into
     her face as she lay there in bed.

     "And in regression she found out the rest of that particular
     story. She was floated downstairs and she found that some GREYS
     were PHYSICALLY CARRYING her three children outside to a waiting
     craft. She was levitated outside to the same craft.

     "She recognized immediately that this black lizard-like guy,
     which she later learned actually had a tail... was actually
     WORKING WITH THE GREYS, but, she said, they did not (always) get
     along. It was the 'Greys' craft... she was literally 'listening'
     to their 'telepathy'. They were conversing about her as she was
     lying on a table in the craft waiting for their decision on what
     to do. She became convinced that the black one wanted to KILL
     her, and the Greys were 'saying'... 'No... not on OUR ship.' She
     said she saw something horrifying at that point. She said the
     black one just 'swept' its hand across the chest of one of the
     greys and literally tore the greys chest open. It fell to the
     ground and she thinks it died. She says, 'I know they have GREEN
     blood, I saw it bleed.'"

Before one feels too 'sorry' for the 'greys', they should understand that
many accounts indicate that the greys have participated in unknown numbers
of animal and human mutilations in order to use the animal AND HUMAN
secretions as a 'liquid protein' food source. And if we are to believe some
of the more fantastic accounts of crash-retrievals, such mutilated animal
and human organs have been discovered within or among the debris of crashed
GREY craft. The 'reptilian' hierarchy seems to operate in an exactly
opposite manner as the Judeo-Christian ethic, and instead of operating on
faith, love and service the reptilian or sauroid hierarchy is said to
operate on fear, hatred and competition. Since both the Greys and
lizard-like 'aliens' operate on 'collective consciousness' and are
neo-saurian in nature according to many sources, and since they have a
similar agenda which seems to be imperial-conquest motivated, they
inevetably work together in what Michael Lindemann calls a 'wedding of
convenience'.

From one perspective, one should NOT see the 'iguanas' as being much worse
than the greys. For what the green-blooded 'greys' lack in the way of
demoniacal 'hatred' or contempt for humankind, they seem to make up in
their profound 'indifference' to the human race. Over and over again
abductees describe the greys as emotionless and methodical, and seemingly
show no sympathy or pity whatsoever toward human suffering or death, but
merely look upon it with scientific 'curiosity'. Although 'hatred' would
seem to be the opposite of 'compassion', others would argue that
'indifference' is the antithesis of compassion, caring or love. From this
perspective, 'indifference' to human life may be no less evil than raging
'contempt' for human life. BOTH may be the motivating factors behind all
kinds of atrocities.

In reference to the case referred to above, Lindemann continues:

     "...Her hypnotherapist said to us at this point, 'You know, you
     really ought to understand that this woman is a very, very good
     hypnotic subject and she actually re-lives her experiences in
     real time in the first person. She goes through all of the
     emotions and she has incredible recall of detail.' ...she
     says...as a therapist of long standing she has no reason to doubt
     that the detail that this woman brings forward is essentially
     accurate. It matches of course in many, many particulars the kind
     of information that other abductees have also told.

     "...One of the other disturbing things that this woman has
     mentioned...is that in other sessions where she was abducted, she
     found herself in an underground facility which she feels quite
     certain was at George Air Force Base where she grew up. And in
     that facility underground she saw the greys were working side by
     side with human military personnel. And we do have other reports,
     not only 'we' but many people who study the abduction phenomena,
     collective reports indicating that the abduction phenomenon is
     occurring right under the noses of our own officials, that there
     is apparently some agreement operating here..."

The above account would seem to confirm that the SAURIAN GREYS (which are
basically neo-saurian or reptilian in configuration according to alleged
government autopsies) are being used by their larger reptilian superiors as
the 'technical brains' behind some hidden agenda, and as a type of cosmic
'double agent' race. Numerous accounts indicate that the Greys are
willfully subservient to the larger 'Draconian' entities and, because of
the OUTWARDLY less-intimidating through nevertheless frightening
appearance, the greys are used to 'interface' with U.S. military personnel.
Also, many individuals within 'deep' military organizations have since come
forward and implied that the 'Greys' used these interactions to establish
foot- in-the-door treaties with the Military which were never meant to be
honored, but were used only as 'platforms' to get control, via implantation
and so on, of sensitive government-military personnel. The Greys are said
to have used deception profusely to get their way. Part of the reason why
the 'agreements' continue even after the 'Grand Deception' was discovered,
some suggest, is simply because the greys have 'taken over' the minds of
certain officials in high government positions. This continued 'pact' with
the serpent race may also, in part, be explained by the malevolent
influence of the 'Jesuit-Illuminati' or the 'Serpent Cult' in certain
policy making groups such as 'MJ-12', the Jason Society, etc.

The following article describes what might be a similar group of beings as
the 'Lizard Men' described earlier, although these creatures seem to have
been somewhat more human-size in their configuration and apparently intent
on passing themselves off as human-like entities. The account appeared in
the Omaha, Nebraska 'METRO UPDATE' for Oct. 29 - Nov. 4, 1990. Written by
reporter Patricia C. Ress, the article was titled: 'LINCOLN MAN RECOUNTS
ABDUCTIONS BY ALIENS':

"People have been talking about flying saucers for about 45 years now --
longer if you count the reports of the so-called 'foo fighters' seen by
pilots on both sides during World War II. But within the past 20 years
we've been hearing more about a more frightening side to these visitations
- abduction by aliens.

"The most famous case was that of Barney and Betty Hill, two New Englanders
returning home from vacation and unable to account for a large block of
missing time. Under hypnosis, a very frightening and detailed account of
alien abduction emerged. Later there was Betty Andreason, who told of
aliens who took her through walls and closed doors.

"Then came Budd Hopkins, who made a study of such abductions and chronicled
one case in 'INTRUDERS-THE INCREDIBLE VISITATIONS AT COPELY WOODS.' Next
came the 'Gulf Breeze Sightings' in Florida, and most recently author
Whitley Strieber's accounts of his own abductions in his books 'COMMUNION'
and 'TRANSFORMATION.'

"While most of these abductions took place in the East, some say that
visiting aliens have been just as busy in the Midwest -- even Nebraska. A
Lincoln man recently recounted his experiences during a talk at the
Oakcrest Institute in Elkhorn.

"John Foster has been an engineer in Lincoln for a number of years.
Lincoln, in fact, is his home town and the place where his abduction
experiences began back in 1950. A soft-spoken down-home type of man, Foster
reminds people of a young Joel McCrea.

"'Alien abduction is a terrifying and traumatic experience,' Foster told
the audience. 'Psychiatric counselors don't know how to deal with this --
even if you can get them to believe you.'

"Foster has gotten help and understanding from people like Dr. Leo Sprinkle
of the University of Wyoming, who has dealt with numerous alien abduction
cases. He also has been the subject of ridicule and rejection by both
family and friends.

"'Often in a UFO abduction experience, things happen that are absolutely
unbelievable. I have been told that IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR FAMILIES TO
BREAK UP AFTER SUCH AN EXPERIENCE. I finally reached the point where I no
longer care what people think of me.' Foster said.

"He said he wasn't fully aware of what had happened to him over the years
until the 1980s. In 1981 he was sitting outside his home in Lincoln with a
friend and on a lark, they both said a prayer (or incantation? - Branton)
that they would see a flying saucer and soon after, one appeared, he said.

"On another occasion in March, 1966, he saw a light out behind the trees as
he sat on his patio, he said, and the sight triggered a distant memory of
something that had happened to him when he was in grade school in Lincoln
in 1950.

"He said 40 or 50 people were outside watching a movie when swirling lights
suddenly appeared, ALONG WITH A CRAFT THAT INITIALLY LOOKED LIKE A
HELICOPTER.

"Foster recalled being INCAPACITATED AND FEELING STRANGE. He said he saw a
craft appear WITH THREE LITTLE MEN who appeared to be fixing it. He felt an
overwhelming desire to get inside the craft, but once he did, he discovered
it was in a different form. 'We got a lesson about history, mankind and
something about Indians and buffalo,' he said.

"When he looked around him, Foster said, he noticed that everyone else
seemed to be FROZEN IN TIME. 'They all looked like statues,' he said, he
saw a woman who told him she had FIXED HERSELF UP SO THAT HE WOULDN'T BE
TRAUMATIZED.

"He said he was taken to an examining room BY CREATURES THAT LOOKED 'LIKE
FROGS OR LIZARDS.' The 'woman' told him they were the educators and would
supervise his learning experience, he said. Among other strange things,
Foster recalled THAT THE LIZARD MEN ENCOURAGED HIM TO JOIN THE MASONIC
LODGE.

"After he was examined, Foster said, he was sent back out of the craft to
the crowd below. The woman (i.e. the being that had 'fixed' itself up to
appear as a 'woman' - Branton) spoke to him in almost a scolding tone,
saying that from then on he would be a good boy and mind his parents, he
said. The woman seemed to know a lot about him, including the fact that he
and some friends had stolen some pop and candy from a store across the
street, he said.

"In October 1986 Foster went camping with his wife and children at Niobrara
Park and he had a short visitation which awakened more memories of previous
abductions, he said.

"By mid-December he recalled 50 abduction experiences, he said, and by
January that number had grown to 2,000 and by January 1987, he had recalled
3,000 abductions.

"Foster has recorded memories of 50 of the abductions in detail, another
450 in short notations and many others by locations only, he said.

"'There are roughly two areas of the so-called close encounters,' Foster
said. 'These may mesh together, but there are the abductees who seem to be
taken aboard a craft to be examined and the contactees who appear to be
contacted throughout life and seem to have an assignment.'

"In June of 1987 Foster and his daughter met with several other contactees
and he had the feeling that he had known them all his life, he said.

"They helped him recall experiences from coast to coast and from Canada to
Mexico, he said.

"'I believe the UFO experiences are directed at you personally,' Foster
said, 'but there are times when they can seem to address the population in
general.

"'THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE WITH THE MYSTERIOUS 'CORN CIRCLES' THAT
FIRST APPEARED IN ENGLAND AND CAN NOW BE SEEN IN CANADA AND THE U.S. AND
OTHER PLACES.' (Note: Many of these symbols are very intricate and are
meaningless to most. Could they be some type of 'signal' to those who have
been abducted-programmed, signals which are intended to 'trigger' some
subconscious reaction in certain abductees? Admittedly, this is only one of
many possibilities - Branton)

"Foster said profound things happened to him during his abductions and the
world should know about them. HE WAS SHOWN HOW THE 'VISITORS' CAN
MANIPULATE ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND CHANGE THINGS DIRECTLY AT WILL, he said,
and was told things about scientific matters over the years, only to see
them discovered afterward.

"WHILE THE ENTITIES HE INITIALLY ENCOUNTERED LOOKED REPTILIAN, HE SAID, THE
SPIRITUAL 'GUIDES' WERE MORE HUMAN IN APPEARANCE AND WERE ABLE TO 'PHASE IN
AND OUT AT THE DEEPER LEVELS.'

"On the initial level of the abduction experience there is a kind of
excitement, Foster said, while on the deeper level, life plans emerge and
there is interaction with people who have had similar experiences. Foster
said there are four witnesses who can recall parts of at least three of his
encounters.

"Foster said that to document his experiences, he has made several drawings
and paintings. He believes he has encountered at least 13 different kinds
of crafts.

"Foster said he remembers abductions that involved his friends when they
were teenagers. A large 'floating phone booth' would descend from a dark
fog, he said, and a voice seemingly from a loud speaker would urge them to
'gather around for eternal wisdom and knowledge -- and something else about
Indians and buffalo,' he said."

(Note: was the promise of 'eternal wisdom' the bait used to entrap them
into the Reptilian agenda? We realize this sounds rather simplistic but
ancient accounts do reveal that this exact same strategy was used by the
original 'Serpent' race of Hebrew tradition, in their unholy alliance with
INVISIBLE fallen angelic beings, to destroy man's connection with the
Almighty -- and subsequently, his divinely-given authority over creation,
including his dominion over the BEASTS! In relation to this, the third
chapter of GENESIS states that the serpent race was the most "subtil" of
all the members of the animal kingdom -- those "beasts" that had no eternal
"soul" essence as does humankind. The Hebrew word for "subtil" is ARUWM,
literally meaning "CUNNING [usually in a bad sense] or CRAFTY". Those who
have seen Steven Spielberg's depiction of the 7 ft. tall RAPTORS in the
movie "JURASSIC PARK" can gain a sense of just how "cunning" and cruel
these creatures were and, according to various witnesses, still are today -
Branton).

Foster, in reference to the floating "phone booth", stated that: "The voice
over the loudspeaker would call them by name AND COULD AT TIMES SOUND
SARCASTIC (as a manipulator might sound? - Branton). On one occasion, his
friends SHOT AT THE BOOTH WITH RIFLES AND THREW BEER CANS AT IT.

"When he was at Mahoney Lake in 1987, Foster said, he again saw both the
booth and the saucer. He asked the entities to quit bothering him because
he was disturbed when he COULDN'T RECALL his abductions, he said, AND THEY
TOLD HIM IF HE REMEMBERED THE EXPERIENCES, IT WOULD NEGATE THEIR PURPOSE.

"They also told him that if he didn't want to have any more abduction
experiences, he would meet some people who would 'HELP HIM BECOME MORE
METAPHYSICAL,' he said, and he later met such people.

"He said he recalls being pulled up into a kind of floating bus and being
taken into the future. He declined to say what he saw.

"Foster said he was given experiments to do as an engineer. 'They worked,
but they shouldn't have, according to what we know,' he said.

"He said the 'guides' told him they were preparing people for a time when
the chosen would be taken away.

"...'I was told to awaken people to other dimensions and to participate in
these realms,' he said..." (i.e. opening themselves up to or surrendering
to the occult and supernatural powers and realms which these Reptilians
control, in order to be more easily controlled and manipulated by them?
Just a thought - Branton)

In reference to the Saurian Grays and the Secret Societies they allegedly
manipulate, researcher Bill Hamilton, who claims to have had contact with
one 'Nordic' or 'Telosian' family, offers a synopsis of his own findings.
Mr. Hamilton provides some informative research that may help us to
understand this mystery in a fuller perspective. In an article which
appeared in Patrick O'Connell's "TRENDS AND PREDICTIONS ANALYST"
Newsletter, Vol. 6, No. 2 (July, 1990) issue, William Hamilton stated:

     "...The cover-up was initiated soon after the Roswell, N.M.
     crash. We wanted to know - 1) Who they were, 2) Why they were
     here, 3) How their technology worked. The cover-up became a
     matter of NATIONAL SECURITY (a blanket word covering secrecy and
     deception). The cover-up involves secret organizations within our
     government such as MJ-12, PI-40, MAJI, Delta, the Jason Scholars,
     & known intelligence organizations such as Naval Intelligence,
     Air Force Office of Special Investigation, the Defence
     Investigative Service, the CIA, NSA, and more! It involves THINK
     TANKS such as RAND, the Ford Foundation, the Aspen Institute, &
     Brookings Institute. It involves corporations such as Bechtel,
     GE, ITT, Amoco, Northrup, Lockheed, & many others. It involves
     SECRET SOCIETIES who may be the hidden bosses of the orchestrated
     events (i.e. economic collapse, wars, assassin- ations,
     conspiracies to manipulate & control humans & thereby to exercise
     enormous power over the destiny of the human race) - the
     Illuminati, Masons, Knights of Malta, etc. The individual players
     are too numerous to list. The whole of this conspiracy forms an
     INTERLOCKING NEXUS. The goal is said to be a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT
     (or Dictatorship)!

     "'The Underground Nation' - The RAND symposium held on Deep
     Underground Construction indicated that plans were hatched during
     the 50's to build underground bases, laboratories, & city-
     complexes linked by a stupendous network of tunnels to preserve &
     protect the ongoing secret interests of the secret societies.
     These secret societies made a pact with alien entities in order
     to further motives of domination."

Actually, as it turns out, THEY (the secret societies) are now being
'dominated' by the 'aliens'. One can only assume that if certain humans
would 'sell out' their own kind to an alien race and use such an infernal
alliance to gain dominion over their fellow man, then they should consider
the fact that they, according to universal law, must in the same way open
THEMSELVES up to being manipulated and controlled by their supposed
benefactors. As it is written, "the servant is not greater than his lord."
There are indications, as we've said earlier, that an antediluvian race or
races may have attempted this very same thing, the construction of vast
subterraneous systems like the ones now being built by the more modern
secret societies.

There are also indications, as we have also said, that later societies and
their underground networks intersect these ancient antediluvian excavations
and outposts. This is evidenced by the many accounts which suggest that
Masonic-related secret societies are utilizing both the ancient and modern
sub-systems. Many indications also point to the fact that entire human
colonies, both peaceful and 'alien controlled', may exist within these
deeper levels. These colonies are allegedly inhabited in part by ancient
native American or meso-American tribes or explorers who crossed the seas
from ancient Mediterranea and elsewhere in the eastern hemisphere thousands
of years ago. These may also include more recent (past few centuries)
American inhabitants or explorers of Anglo-saxon descent as well.
Indications are that such explorers happened to discover some of these
ancient antediluvian excavations, which led to deep tunnel networks and
ancient hydrothermal and geothermal cavities containing conditions
sufficient to sustain physical life.

Mr. Hamilton continues:

     "...The underground complexes are not confined to the U.S. alone!
     A large underground complex operated by the U.S. exists at Pine
     Gap, near Alice Springs, Australia (Note: According to various
     sources, conditions in this complex are somewhat similar to those
     at Dulce, that is, this underground base contains replicated
     flying 'disks' based on 'alien' technology, and many workers
     there have allegedly been implanted and operate under a type of
     mental control of the Secret Government and Gray aliens which
     also reportedly utilize the base as part of the Illuminati-Gray
     "joint interaction" - Branton).

     "...It appears that the secret societies among us have become
     aware of the coming planetary eco-catastrophe & the possibility
     of an earth polar shift in the near future. Surveying the earth
     from space, satellites & shuttles reveal EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO OUR
     ECOSPHERE! Our planet is wobbling on its axis & its magnetic
     field is decaying! Ozone depletion & the greenhouse effect are
     rapidly endangering life on our planet. Alternatives, which
     include - 1) direct handling of the atmospheric problems, 2)
     taking shelter in underground domains, & 3) escape to other
     planetary bodies in the solar system, have been devised in
     secret. However there is a possible Alternative 4 which mostly
     depends on a completely different idea on how to save the earth
     (in essence, by escaping to another "dimension" - Branton)..."

Based upon the relatively elusive yet extensive accounts and relative data
which has been gathered by a loosely-connected group of researchers, we can
conclude that the subterranean network -- whatever it consists of presently
-- is basically inhabited by both human and non-human reptilian beings. In
those areas where the humans are not being controlled by the non-humans or
saurians, there is obviously conflict between the two races as foretold in
Genesis chapter 3. Many of the American subterranean networks, before the
turn of the century (1900), were apparently inhabited mostly by human
societies, yet it seems as if a reptilian 'invasion' of the sub-strata of
North America occurred en masse in the early part of the 1900's, with a
major 'push' into the U.S. subnet from already-occupied underground systems
in Central and South America taking place around 1933. This, according to
many accounts, involved reptilian beings which had been in possession of
underlying cavern networks beneath Asia and the Far East, and according to
their imperialistic-predatory nature these creatures began expanding their
influence into the Western Hemisphere -- first into Central and South
America, and finally North America itself. Some unconfirmed reports tell of
whole groups of humans (both surface exploration parties or even
troglodytical tribes) who have literally been wiped-out in sudden attacks
by the serpent race in a type of "battle beneath the earth".

Aside from the human and reptilian entities, there are some who speak of a
third type of being, a (so-called) 'hybrid' between the humans and
reptilians. The indications are that such a 'hybrid' would be impossible,
theologically and scientifically speaking. The serpent races simply possess
no soul-matrix (or 'conscience') as do humans, and even if it were possible
to genetically or artificially produce an 'apparent' cross-breed, the
creature produced could never be an actual 'hybrid', but would inevitably
fall to one side or the other - a corrupted form of human being possessing
a soul, or a mutated version of the 'reptilian' or 'serpent' race. Bill
Hamilton explains another reason why such a natural (thank God) cross
between the two could never be produced:

"...It is unlikely that the reptilian greys are cross-breeding with humans.
Reptilians carry their sex organs internally and reproduce by eggs hatched
by solar heat. Reptoids have well developed eyes, no hair follicles, & no
external ear cartilage as consistent with most reptilian species. Since
their means of reproduction is incompatible with our own, it is suggested
that humans (women - Branton) may be fertilized by the grays by artificial
insemination with human spermatozoa or perhaps they use the human uterus as
an incubation chamber."

Note: Other indications are that the reptilians inject or encodify the
human embryo with reptilian DNA during the early stages of development.
Also, aside from the description given by Dale Russell to the effect that
the ancient progenitors of the gray-type saurians may have had a type of
'ear', we presently know of only one other account describing a possible
'ear-like' appendage having been seen on a saur-oid creature. This was
described by a Mr. Brian Scott, who was allegedly abducted into an
underground base beneath the Superstition Mts. area east of Phoenix,
Arizona. He described these large, fearful creatures as having a type of
'flap' of leathery or 'crocodilian' texture which came down each side of
their heads. It is uncertain however whether this was a type of ear-like
appendage or not. These creatures according to Scott claimed to have a base
in 'Epsilon Bootes' and worked with a smaller group of grayish white dwarfs
of typical 'gray' description AS WELL AS WITH a group of 'transparent'
entities who referred to themselves as 'the hosts', or the 'Ashtar' beings.
Note the similarity between this description and John Foster's account in
Nebraska's METRO-UPDATE. These transparent beings once told Brian that they
were 'Beelzebub', and tried to convince him and his wife (who was once
'molested' by one of the infernal poltergeist-like creatures in her
bathroom) to 'sell their souls' to them, and generally acted in a similar
fashion as the malevolent beings typically described in connection with
demoniacal possession cases.

As for the so-called 'hybrids', Hamilton's statements seem to be confirmed
by others, including abductees, who have hinted that the 'hybrid' fetuses
are actually conceived through human spermatozoa taken from men and ovum
taken from women abductees, and that the fetuses are as we have stated
somehow genetically altered with possible reptilian 'cells' or genetic
coding being added. Many of the so-called hybrids however are nevertheless
'human', possessing human souls, and human blood - Branton).

Hamilton continues:

     "...Alien vehicles are being tested at the alien physical
     technology center at S-4 at the Nevada Test Site. Alien vehicles
     are being replicated at Kirtland AFB & Sandia Laboratories &
     these replicas are referred to as ARVs (Alien Reproductive
     Vehicles). At least three of these vehicles are stored in hangers
     at Norton AFB, California. It is alleged that vehicle propulsion
     units were constructed by General Electric & composite materials
     were provided by Amoco. Alien vehicles generate an artificial
     gravity field which can be focused & intensified for high speed
     travel... Alien organisms and biological technology are tested
     (in the upper levels - Branton) at the underground biogenetic
     laboratories at Dulce, New Mexico. Alien genetic engineering,
     cloning, & cryogenic technology have been studied with a view
     towards 'enhancing' human genetics, deciphering the human genome,
     & gaining a biological advantage by ARTIFICIAL BIOLOGICAL
     ENGINEERING. Strange life forms have been bred in these
     laboratories..."

Mr. Byron Carpedium, in a 'letter to the Editor' in the 'LEADING EDGE',
dated February 18, 1990 presented some remarkable claims which we quote in
entirety below:

"Dear Editor... As more and more information is beginning to surface
concerning UFOs, super-technology, 'alien' cultures, abductions,
multi-level coverups and conspiracies I see many different people trying to
assemble data to get, or give, a better picture of what is really happening
around us. Individually I do not believe that any ONE of us can gather ALL
the facts, assemble them and expose it in a way that is palatable to Joe
Citizen. COLLECTIVELY, however, I think that we can make an impact by
increasing the total awareness of the entire population. This does not have
to happen over a period of 10 or 20 years as would be done in a gradual
acclimation program. It can be done in a relatively short period of time,
if the proper steps are taken. Once the awareness or awakening process is
complete, the individual must then decide whether or not to believe the
information and the source of that information. Then the individual MUST
act upon it in some form or fashion.

"The latter two steps can be done more efficiently in many ways. One
possibility is to take some item or fact that most everyone agrees upon and
then impart some new information about it to those interested about it. For
example, if anyone saw the John Lear lectures in Houston last year or has
seen the video tape, you saw Lear ask three questions at the beginning of
the lecture: the third being 'How many of you think that Oswald shot
Kennedy?' Naturally only a handful of people raised their hand. By this
time Lear has gained the trust of his audience and has most everyone in
agreement. Then he does not tell the audience, but instead shows the
audience the Zapruder film showing W. Greer shooting the President. After
this, convincing the audience of the rest is simple.

"The pieces are coming out now and need to be put together. Bill Cooper has
gone several steps beyond Lear by tying things together on a global scale.
Recently people with direct access to inside information are now
corroborating what other researchers have long suspected.

"Evidence suggesting a secret project to fly 'alien' vehicles in Nevada to
Alien/US/Soviet bases and operations on the moon are now some of the hot
topics amongst UFOlogists and researchers. These are, for most people,
ideas that are so far out that they cannot be believed. One of the reasons,
I believe, for this attitude is the fact that VERY few people have ever
researched anything having to do with the U.S. OFFICIAL space program,
NASA, and it's relationship to the UFO coverup. If researchers, authors,
lecturers, etc., would take the time to point out where NASA has
suppressed, hidden and simply lied about information dealing with the U.S.
space program people may consider these esoteric ideas more believable
based on their new knowledge that the U.S. space program is not what it
appears to be.

"MOONGATE by William Brian II is a good place to start. After that you can
talk to people at NASA. Specifically people connected with the Department
of Defense (DOD) missions. Many of these people, if willing to talk, will
paint a very different picture of what is happening with OUR space program
(remember, it is a civilian operation right??? Well, if you think it is,
you had better look again).

"NASA was created on October 1, 1958. The main reason for NASA's creation
was to capitalize on the military potential of space. A secondary reason
was so that large sums of money may be diverted into 'black' projects which
the public was to have no knowledge about. The plan was simple and quite
easily accomplished. Money and manufactured items for top-secret or black
projects can readily be allocated if they are hidden within our
unclassified projects. Contractors and Subcontractors brought in by NASA
have no idea where the money goes, what the parts they design and
manufacture are really for and they almost never see the end project or
result because everything is so compartmentalized at NASA.

"I am still in the process of gathering, verifying, and assembling this
information so naturally I am interested in finding others who may be able
to support or refute any of my findings. The following list of facts I have
learned from several individuals who are working or who have worked or been
linked with NASA in some way over the years. For obvious reasons I will not
now use their real names. The list below represents some of the information
from three people: one is currently working in DOD missions for NASA;
another started working with NASA & DOD when JSC (Johnson Space Center) was
built. He 'committed suicide' after the Space Shuttle Challenger was
destroyed.

"The third is a scientist who has worked at NASA and other facilities. His
work with Edward Teller (i.e. the inventor of the H-Bomb and alleged member
of MJ-12 - Branton) is what is most known about this man:

     "* There are buildings on the Moon.

     "* There is mining equipment on the Moon.

     "* Photos, NASA photos, do exist which clearly show both of
     these.

     "* Hundreds, but probably thousands, of NASA photos have been
     tampered with. Specifically, by careful use of an airbrush,
     flying saucers and other UFOs can be removed, and then the photo
     is released to the public and/or press.

     "* Film taken by astronauts clearly show UFOs, IFOs, Alien
     Vehicles, etc.

     "* The NSA screens all photos before release to the public.

     "* Everything that NASA has launched has been closely monitored
     by at least one 'alien' culture.

     "* NASA knew about 'alien' activity on the Moon before Armstrong,
     Aldrin, and Collins ever set foot on it.

     "* Edwin Aldrin at one point found evidence that we were NOT THE
     FIRST to arrive on the moon. After first seeing and then taking
     photographs of footprints in the lunar soil he then saw the
     beings that made the footprints (the report and transcripts of
     conversations between the astronauts were not clear if Aldrin had
     physical and/or mental contact with the entities).

     "* Analysis of the footprint photos indicated that the beings
     that made them would have weighed (on Earth) 300-350 lbs. and
     would stand at least seven feet tall (which supported Aldrin's
     account).

     "* Alien Vehicles flew within 50 feet of a U.S. space vehicle for
     one full Earth orbit and then the AV departed; again while Aldrin
     was present.

     "* 'Buzz' Aldrin had a nervous breakdown because of these events
     and the pressure not to talk.

     "* During the last successful mission before the Challenger
     disaster, NASA and the astronauts on board were warned directly
     by ETs of the impending dangers of space that they would meet (I
     have more details from multiple sources but still need
     confirmation on a few details. Do you know anything about this
     one?) [Note: Certain 'Ham' radio operators have allegedly
     recorded conversations from 'classified' frequencies between a
     Space Shuttle astronaut and Mission Control, making reference to
     an 'Alien Craft' which was following the Shuttle. Whether this
     story is legitimate or not remains to be seen - Branton].

     "* There have been 22 deaths (many 'suicides') at JSC in Houston.

     "* The Space Station project is non-existent. It is a lie and
     will never be built. In reality the project is called the Space
     City.

     "* No astronaut who has seen AVs or ETs is allowed to talk about
     it, even amongst themselves. If they do and are caught they may
     be fined, publicly humiliated, imprisoned, or have all pensions
     and future salaries taken away.

     "* Voyager has been disabled. The pictures received from
     'Neptune' in September of 1989 were not from the probe.

     "* Galileo has been put out of commission and will not be allowed
     to complete its mission. The information being received from the
     probe indicating it's successful function is a deception by the
     'aliens.' (Bill Cooper has stated that the Secret Government
     loaded Galileo with several pounds of plutonium, which 'they'
     intended to use to ignite the hydrogenic 'atmosphere' of Jupiter
     and thus create a nuclear reaction which would theoretically
     convert Jupiter into a small binary 'sun'. These occultists
     supposedly desired to 'create' this 'miraculous event' and call
     the new star 'Lucifer', as a SIGN announcing the 'New World
     Order'. If Cooper's and Carpedium's sources are correct, then NO
     WONDER an 'alien' race with possible bases on the Jovian moons
     would DISABLE such a presumptuous undertaking! - Branton).

     "* NASA is a joke (i.e. in the words of one of the
     'informants'.)..."

The following submitted article allegedly appeared in 'SOVIET LIFE'
magazine under the title; 'AMAZING CLAIM:'

"...A Soviet scientist who defected to the West said photographs taken by
an orbiting satellite clearly show the ruined temples of a long-dead
civilization - on the planet Mars!

"And LASER PROBES made by the secret Russian satellite revealed that the
ruins littering the planet's surface ARE INCREDIBLY YOUNG by space-time
standards (i.e. a few thousand years or less, or contemporary to the height
of the Egyptian Empire as some researchers suggest!? - Branton).

"The 58-year-old scientist was a high-echelon member of an elite team that
has worked together since 1961 when Vostok 1 carried Yuri A. Gagarin as the
first man in space.

"But Russia's growing emphasis on the development of a nuclearized 'Star
Wars' satellite system in space prompted him to flee Russia. He now lives
under an assumed identity somewhere in Switzerland."

The following is from an 'add' introduction for Richard C. Hoagland's book
'THE MONUMENTS OF MARS: A CITY ON THE EDGE OF FOREVER':

"In 1976, NASA sent four Viking spacecraft to Mars, to photograph the
planet and to set landers on its surface to test for the presence of life.
On July 25, as part of the mapping sequence to select a suitable landing
site, one of the orbiters photographed a peculiar-looking mesa resembling a
human face a mile long. At the time the facial resemblance was dismissed by
NASA as a trick of light and shadow. However, three years later, two
computer scientists, Vince DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar, rediscovered the
photograph in the National Space Science Data Center.

"Richard C. Hoagland, former Science Advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS
News, consultant for Cable News Network, and Editor of STAR AND SKY, was a
member of the NASA press corps on that memorable day in July and is now in
the forefront of the Mars investigation. Through careful analysis of a
variety of photographs of the Cydonia region (in which the 'face' resides)
and consultation with scientists and other professionals, he discovered the
presence of other monuments and structures, including what is possibly an
underground city in the style of Paolo Soleri's arcologies, plus a series
of regular relationships and symmetries among the artifacts.

"In a wide-ranging and profound analysis of the 'Mars data,' Hoagland
explains the importance of the 'face' and its implication regarding not
only the past but future of the human species. As he himself writes: 'I
realized I was looking at something that was either a complete waste of
time, or the most important discovery of the twentieth century... There is
no middle ground. It either is or is not artificial... If it is, it is
imperative that we figure it out because... IT DOES NOT BELONG THERE. Its
presence, if it was made by someone, is trying very hard to tell us
something extraordinary.'

"Does the 'face' summon us to Mars? Why is it OUR face? Why has NASA denied
the existence of the artifact? What are the political implications of a
Soviet-U.S. manned mission to Cydonia? Who were the 'Martians?' How does
the existence of the 'face' change our entire history?

"The 30 SCIENTISTS, known as the Mars Investigation Group, think two
photographs sent back from Mars in 1976 by the Viking space-probe indicate
the existence of an ancient civilization, said Richard Hoagland, group
member and science writer.

"The photos show what appear to be four huge PYRAMIDS lined up
symmetrically with the face about 6 miles away, suggesting a parallel with
Stonehenge, the ancient monument of huge stones in England, Hoagland said
Thursday.

"'Geometrically, the face could be seen in profile [from the pyramids] as
the summer solstice sun rose over it.'

"...Dr. C. West Churchman, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley and the group's principal investigator, said there are too many
details pointing to the possibility of an extinct (? - Branton) Martian
race.

"'It's hard to believe that all that symmetry could have been done by winds
and sand as we know it on Earth,' he said. 'If it had just been the face, I
would not have been that convinced. But the fact that these [pyramids] are
lined up in a certain way with the face makes me inclined to believe that
there was an ancient civilization.'

"The two Viking photographs were taken AT DIFFERENT TIMES of day, reducing
the chance that the figures were illusions cast by tricky shadows, Hoagland
said.

"The face, 1 mile long and 1 mile wide, appears to be looking toward the
stars, he said."

Former Navy Officer William Cooper, mentioned above, claims to have seen
top secret documents concerning UFO's and related events (having seen a UFO
himself - which was of tremendous size and rose out of the sea in full view
of his shipmates) during his involvement with Naval Intelligence. Here is
his story:

     "...There have been many related sequential coincidences all
     throughout my life, incidents that by themselves would have led
     nowhere. Statistically, the odds against the same or a related
     sequence of events happening to one individual are astronomically
     high. It is a series of incidents that have convinced me that God
     has had a hand in my life. I do not believe in fate. I do not
     believe in accidents...

     "We have been taught lies. Reality is not at all what we perceive
     it to be. We cannot survive any longer by hanging onto the
     falsehoods of the past. Reality must be discerned at all costs if
     we are to be a part of the future. Truth must prevail in all
     instances, no matter who it hurts or helps, if we are to continue
     to live upon this earth. At this point, what we want may no
     longer matter. It is what we must do to ensure our survival that
     counts. The old way is in the certain process of destruction and
     a New World Order is beating down the door...

     "I fear for the little ones, the innocents, who are already
     paying for our mistakes. There exists a great army of
     occupationally orphaned children. They are attending government-
     controlled day-care centers. And latch-key kids are running wild
     in the streets... and the lop-sided, emotionally wounded children
     of single welfare mothers, born only for the sake of more money
     on the monthly check. Open your eyes and look at them, for they
     are the future. In them I see the sure and certain destruction of
     this once-proud nation. In their vacant eyes I see the death of
     Freedom. They carry with them a great emptiness--and someone will
     surely pay a great price for their suffering.

     "If we do not act in concert with each other and ensure that the
     future becomes what we need it to be, then we will surely deserve
     whatever fate awaits us.

     "I believe with all my heart that God put me in places and in
     positions throughout my life so that I would be able to deliver
     this warning to His people. I pray that I have been worthy and
     that I have done my job.

     "THIS IS MY CREED - I first believe in God, the same God in which
     my ancestors believed. I believe in Jesus Christ and that he is
     my savior. Second, I believe in the Constitution of the Republic
     of the United States of America, without interpretation, as it
     was written and meant to work. I have given my sacred oath 'to
     protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of
     America against all enemies foreign and domestic.' I intend to
     fulfill that oath. Third, I believe in the family unit and, in
     particular, my family unit. I have sworn that I will give my
     life, if it is required, in defense of God, the Constitution, or
     my family. Fourth, I believe that any man without principles that
     he is ready and willing to die for at any given moment is already
     dead and of no use or consequence whatsoever. - William Cooper.,
     August 3, 1990., Camp Verde, Arizona."

The following document was released by William Cooper to members of various
UFO RESEARCH and PATRIOT RESEARCH organizations. The manuscript, which ties
together certain aspects of the 'Secret Government' and the 'UFO
Phenomena', was titled: THE SECRET GOVERNMENT (The Origin, Identity, and
Purpose of MJ-12. May 23, 1989. Updated November 21, 1990):

"...I originally wrote this piece as a research paper. It was first
delivered at the MUFON Symposium on July 2, 1989, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Most of this knowledge comes directly from, or as a result of my own
research into the TOP SECRET/MAJIC material WHICH I SAW AND READ between
the years 1970 and 1973 as a member of the Intelligence Briefing Team of
the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet. Since some of this information
was derived from sources that I cannot divulge for obvious reasons, and
from published sources which I cannot vouch for...(this) must be termed a
hypothesis. I firmly believe that if the aliens are real, THIS IS THE TRUE
NATURE OF THE BEAST. It is the only scenario THAT ANSWERS ALL THE QUESTIONS
and places the various fundamental mysteries in an arena that makes sense.
It is the only explanation which shows the chronology of events and
demonstrates that the chronologies, when assembled, match perfectly. The
bulk of this I believe to be true if the material that I viewed in the Navy
is authentic. As for the rest, I do not know, and that is why this paper
must be termed a hypothesis. Most historic and current available evidence
supports this hypothesis.

"During the years following World War II the government of the United
States was confronted with a series of events which were to change beyond
prediction its future and with it the future of humanity. These events were
so incredible that they defied belief. A stunned President Truman and his
top military commanders found themselves virtually impotent after having
just won the most devastating and costly war in history.
