Truth Detracting Elements of the  Abduction Phenomena: 

Psychological Implications

By Eve Frances Lorgen, M. A.

This is an article taken directly from my book, The Love Bite. 



              One the hallmarks of an abductee is the pattern of emotional
isolation. This behavior  can be explained as a result of conditioning,
learned adaptations from the abductee's family members, or reinforced by the
alien handlers. The abductee usually learns early in life not to talk about
"the little people" who come into their bedrooms at night. The child
may talk about their abduction experiences only to be told that they are
just  "nightmares". Children often describe the alien intruders as monsters,
who come out of  the closet or through the walls. The children are
immediately invalidated when their  parents or siblings tell them there is
no such thing as monsters, or aliens for that matter. 

              Emotional Isolation and the Maintenance of Secrecy

              Some abductees have discovered that the aliens instructed them
not talk about their encounters. It is apparent that aliens go to great
lengths to maintain secrecy, instill false  or screen memories into their
victims to cover their true motives. 

              Our social structure--especially in the Western
world--reinforces the precept that  "aliens do not exist" or is only science
fiction. The result of these negating and isolating conditions forces the
abductee to turn inward or act out in rebellion against parents,
school, religion or social structure. The abductee who has been denied
validation of  their experience will have a tendency to not trust their own
feelings, stay in denial and  even act out in anger. Those who have turned
anger inward will become depressed or even suicidal depending on the extent
of trauma endured. 

                                   Post Traumatic Stress

              Post traumatic stress disorder is common in those who have had
alien encounters  throughout their lives. If a particular event was
extremely traumatic, the characteristic  symptoms will be: intense fear,
terror, helplessness and partial or complete amnesia.  This may include
re-experiencing the abduction, recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, and
avoidance of stimuli associated with the event and an emotional numbing. The
person  may develop insomnia, increased arousal to stimuli (i.e., noises in
the night), fear of the  dark and sleep disorders such as insomnia and night
terrors. In young children, they  may re-experience the trauma through
repetitive play. They may exhibit a marked change in orientation toward the
future, for example, a foreshortened future whereby  they do not expect to
have a long life, career or marriage. The psychic numbing or diminished
responsiveness to stimuli usually begins soon after the traumatic event.
This emotional anesthesia causes the abductee to feel detached and estranged
from other people. 

              Other symptoms for traumatized abductee children are angry
outbursts, rebellious  acting out behaviors and promiscuity. Extreme phobias
of going to the doctor or dentist,  or even preoccupation with horror scenes
(blood and guts) have been reported. 

                       Dissociation and Addictions as Coping Skills

              At very young ages the abductee is likely to develop
dissociative coping skills if the trauma or abuse was severe. Oftentimes
abuse already occurs in the abductees' family, compounding the issues of
alien abduction. If the parents are in denial of their own alien abductions
and their children's, the abductee has a higher probability of developing
unhealthy coping skills such as, emotional isolation, rebelliousness,
tendency toward violence, drug or alcohol addictions, co-dependency and
early promiscuity. Low self- esteem is a natural by-product of being
invalidated from an early age. 

              Severe forms of personality damage may be later evidenced in
perfectionistic, self-hating, violent, narcissistic tendencies, and
psychopathic or dissociative disorders.   (These do not all appear together
and are exhibited in varying degrees) Egotistical grandiosity is also a
symptom of early trauma that has remained unresolved. This is also
 seen in some mind control victims who have been programmed into being
"super soldiers". Persons who are extremely sensitive to criticism have been
narcissistically  injured and often display symptoms of grandiosity. 

              One element that is difficult to work with is the alien
mind-control induced amnesia of  the abduction event. The compartmentalized,
dissociated memories of alien encounters  are not necessarily trauma induced
as in other human inflicted trauma. This factor makes treatment difficult
unless the therapist, hypnotist or counselor is experienced in working
with such modalities.

                         Secret Keeping Behavior in Relationships

              Unresolved emotional, mental and physical trauma of alien
abductions manifests itself in a myriad of ways. The most common is through
dysfunctional families and relationships.  Dysfunctional can be defined as
any behavior that results in unhealthy relationships.   Secret keeping
behavior and the covert "no talk" rule about alien encounters forces the
abductee to live a false double life. The avoidance of open and honest
communication  and a natural inclination to distrust one's own feelings
thrusts the abductee into  dysfunctional relating patterns. 

              Many abductees have coped quite well considering the forces
against them. I do not want to give the impression that all abductees are in
dysfunctional relationships, but  rather the denial and enforced secrecy of
these issues are the culprit that leads to family problems.

              Contrary to what one may believe, most abductees have not
undergone hypnosis to recover their memories of alien encounters. Few can
afford professional counseling or hypnosis and even if they can, they
usually avoid it because of the mainstream psychological and medical opinion
of alien abductions. Often going to such  professionals who misdiagnosed
them caused greater damage to the individual. 

                      Co-Dependency Issues and Emotional Isolation

              One of the most common dysfunctional patterns is
co-dependency. This term was first coined to describe relating patterns of
spouses or close family members of alcoholics,  substance abusers or child
abusers. The main tenet of co- dependent behavior is to avoid feelings and
open and honest communication. This behavior is acted out in ways
that perpetuate the abusers' addiction and maintenance of secrecy. These
behaviors include protecting the addict or abuser from his or her feelings
and avoidance of core issues.

              Co-dependent persons living with abusers and addicts live
their life as if they were walking on eggshells. They live with a constant
fear or unconscious anxiety not to rock the boat or confront core issues,
which will elicit strong emotions. Very often  co-dependents are people
pleasers who go to great lengths to be friendly and liked by all. The
downside of co-dependent relating is the attraction of unhealthy partners or
 spouses. (This is reported in a majority of abductee relationships.) 

              The unhealthy aspect is the inability and avoidance of being
honest with oneself and  others. This is evident by the direct avoidance of
emotional issues or the tendency to skirt around issues. It is as if they
have blinders over their eyes. Without total honesty, a lack of intimacy
ensues; creating an unfulfilling, empty relationship that perpetuates the
vicious cycle of emotional isolation.

              This same theme can be addressed to abductees, who enter into
dysfunctional relationships that maintain the secrecy and denial of
abduction issues. The blinders serve  the purpose of maintaining secrecy and
avoidance of the emotional pain of the core abduction issues. The deep and
sometimes dark inner truth of their experience--begging to be heard and
healed.

                     Multigenerational Abductions and Family Issues

              Unhealthy coping skills may involve addictions of various
types. Addictions can be the abuse of any substance or repetitive behavior
that serves to keep the person in denial of unresolved psychological and
emotional issues. In this case, avoidance of abduction related trauma, pain,
terror, fear, grief, abandonment and despair of rejection.

              When alien abduction occurs multigenerationally, dysfunctional
family issues are  compounded. These issues comprise all levels of being;
physical, emotional, mental and  spiritual. All levels must be addressed
before healing and integration can occur. I've  come across professional
psychologists who claim that the majority of post traumatic
stress and dysfunctional family issues in abductees are not from alien
abductions, but from other more "easily explained" psychological theories.
That may be true in part, but  in families where abductions have occurred
for several generations, the denial and  trauma of hidden abductions
compounds--and even creates the dysfunctional behaviors. Resolution and
healing of alien abduction related issues can only be complete when false
and misleading psychological "swamp gas" theories are put to rest and
 hopefully, disproven.

              In many of Barbara's cases where many hypnotic regressions
were conducted, the therapeutic process of the individual extended into many
years. Sometimes daily phone calls were necessary to keep the client
stabilized during extreme emotional processing.   Aftercare of hypnotic
regressions is necessary for the complete recovery of the  abductee
especially if reality shattering trauma was uncovered.

                 The Alien Control Factor and The Stockholm Syndrome

              The main difference between alien abduction trauma and versus
other trauma- based  problems is the added factor of the aliens continued
perpetration of such victimizing activities. Not only do the aliens continue
to contact and abduct the individual, but they also will often act in ways
to prevent the abductee from getting the factual information  they need to
heal from these issues. Often abductees change their attitude concerning
their abductors from anger and helplessness or critical thinking to
adoration and compliance, similar to the "Stockholm" syndrome.
            
              UFO researchers, abduction therapists, psychological and
medical professionals dealing  with abductees often overlook this alien
"control" factor. Core issues of abductees  cannot fully be addressed until
the control factor of the alien presence is acknowledged.  (This includes
acquisition of evidence of alien abductions.) 

                                Health Issues of Abductees

              Health issues are a frequent complaint of abductees. The most
common medical anomalies are in the area of gynecological and sexual organs,
severe back pain, miscellaneous allergies, skin rashes, autoimmune
disorders, migraines and endocrine  abnormalities. Some abductees are so
affected by their health problems that they are on permanent disability, not
able to work a regular job.

              I've encountered situations in which the abductee was suddenly
struck ill as a result of  "alien instigated" truth detracting and spiritual
warfare tactics. Unusual health problems  such as panic attacks and anxiety,
heart problems, severe back pain, migraines, nausea  and extreme exhaustion
have resulted from the abductees' efforts to search for the truth  of their
experiences. These blatant health issues and uncoincidental events and
accidents are not simple psychological self-sabotage, but something much
more revealing. The important point here is not the health issues
themselves, but the effects that arise as a result of abductions and "alien
manipulation".
