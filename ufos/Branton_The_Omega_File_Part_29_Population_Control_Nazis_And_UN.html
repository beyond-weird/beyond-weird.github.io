                                The OMEGA File
       POPULATION CONTROL, NAZIS, AND THE U.N.! -- by Anton Chaitkin

                        ROCKFELLER AND MASS MURDER

The ROCKEFELLER Foundation is the PRIME SPONSOR of public relations for the
UNITED NATION'S drastic depopulation program, which the world is invited to
accept at the UN's scheduled September conference in Cairo, Egypt. Evidence
in the possession of a growing number of researchers in America, England,
and Germany demonstrates that the Foundation and its CORPORATE, MEDICAL,
and POLITICAL associates organized the racial MASS MURDER program of NAZI
GERMANY. These globalists, who function as a conduit for British Empire
geopolitics, were NOT stopped after World War II. The UNITED NATIONS
alliance of the old NAZI rightwing with the NEW AGE leftwing poses an even
graver danger to the world today than the same grouping did in 1941. Oil
monopolist John D. Rockefeller created the family-run Rockefeller
Foundation in 1909. By 1929 he had placed $300 million worth of the
family's controlling interest in the Standard Oil Company of NEW JERSEY
[later called 'EXXON'] to the account of the Foundation. The Foundation's
money created the medical specialty known as PSYCHIATRIC GENETICS. For the
new experimental field, the Foundation reorganized medical teaching in
Germany, creating and thenceforth continuously directing the "Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry'' and the "`Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity.'' The Rockefellers' chief
executive of these institutions was the fascist Swiss psychiatrist Ernst
Rudin, assisted by his proteges Otmar Verschuer and Franz J. Kallmann. In
1932, the British-led "Eugenics'' movement designated the Rockefellers' Dr.
Rudin as the president of the worldwide Eugenics Federation. The movement
called for the killing or sterilization of people whose HEREDITY made them
a public burden.

                            THE RACIAL LAWS...

A few months later, Hitler took over Germany and the Rockefeller-Rudin
apparatus became a section of the Nazi state. The regime appointed Rudin
head of the Racial Hygiene Society. Rudin and his staff, as part of the
Task Force of Heredity Experts chaired by SS chief Heinrich Himmler, drew
up the sterilization law. Described as an American Model law, it was
adopted in July 1933 and proudly printed in the September 1933 Eugenical
News [USA] with Hitler's signature. The Rockefeller group drew up other
race laws, also based on existing Virginia statutes. The 'T4'' unit of the
Hitler Chancery, based on psychiatrists led by Rudin and his staff,
cooperated in creating propaganda films to sell mercy killing [euthanasia]
to German citizens. The public reacted antagonistically: Hitler had to
withdraw a tear-jerker right-to-die film from the movie theaters. The
proper groundwork had not yet been laid. Under the Nazis, the German
chemical company I.G. FARBEN and Rockefeller's STANDARD [EXXON] OIL of New
Jersey were effectively a SINGLE FIRM, merged in hundreds of cartel
arrangements. I.G. FARBEN was led up until 1937 by the Warburg family,
Rockefeller's partner in banking and in the design of Nazi German eugenics.
Following the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Standard Oil pledged to
keep the merger with I.G. Farben going even if the U.S. entered the war.
This was exposed in 1942 by Sen. Harry Truman's investigating committee,
and President Roosevelt took hundreds of legal measures during the war to
stop the Standard - I.G. Farben cartel from supplying the enemy war
machine. In 1940-41, I.G. Farben built a gigantic factory at Auschwitz in
Poland, to utilize the Standard Oil / I.G. Farben patents with
concentration camp slave labor to make gasoline from coal. The SS was
assigned to guard the Jewish and other inmates and select for killing those
who were unfit for I.G. Farben slave labor. Standard-Germany president Emil
Helfferich testified after the war that Standard Oil funds helped pay for
SS guards at Auschwitz. In 1940, six months after the notorious
Standard-I.G. meeting, European Rockefeller Foundation official Daniel
O'Brian wrote to the Foundation's chief medical officer Alan Gregg that "it
would be unfortunate if it was chosen to stop research which has no
relation to war issues'' -- so the Foundation continued financing Nazi
"psychiatric research'' (which translates into "mind control" research. -
Branton) during the war. In 1936, Rockefeller's Dr. Franz Kallmann
interrupted his study of hereditary degeneracy and emigrated to America
because he was half-Jewish. Kallmann went to New York and established the
Medical Genetics Department of the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
The SCOTTISH RITE of Freemasonry published Kallman's study of over 1,000
cases of schizophrenia, which tried to prove its hereditary basis. In the
book, Kallmann thanked his long-time boss and mentor Rudin. Kallmann's
book, published in 1938 in the USA and Nazi Germany, was used by the T4
unit as a rationalization to begin in 1939 the murder of mental patients
and various "defective'' people, perhaps most of them CHILDREN. Gas and
lethal injections were used to kill 250,000 under this program, in which
the staffs for a BROADER murder program were de-sensitized and trained.

                              DR. MENGELE...

In 1943, Otmar Verschuer's assistant Josef Mengele was made medical
commandant of Auschwitz. As wartime director of Rockefeller's Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics and Human Heredity in Berlin,
Verschuer secured funds for Mengele's experiments at Auschwitz from the
German Research Council. Verschuer wrote a progress report to the Council:
"My co-researcher in this research is my assistant the anthropologist and
physician Mengele. He is serving as Hauptstuermfuehrer and camp doctor in
the concentration camp Auschwitz.... With the permission of the
Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler, anthropological research is being undertaken on
the various racial groups in the concentration camps and blood samples will
be sent to my laboratory for investigation.'' Mengele prowled the railroad
lines leading into Auschwitz, looking for twins -- a favorite subject of
psychiatric geneticists. On arrival at Mengele's experimental station,
twins filled out "a detailed questionnaire from the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute.'' There were daily drawings of blood for Verschuer's "specific
protein'' research. Needles were injected into eyes for work on eye color.
There were experimental blood transfusions and infections. Organs and limbs
were removed, sometimes without anesthetics. Sex changes were attempted.
Females were sterilized, males were castrated. Thousands were murdered and
their organs, eyeballs, heads, and limbs were sent to Verschuer and the
Rockefeller group at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. (Remember, the
Rockefellers were originally German immigrants to America. - Branton) In
1946, Verschuer wrote to the Bureau of Human Heredity in London, asking for
help in continuing his "scientific research.''

                                FACELIFT...

In 1947, the Bureau of Human Heredity moved from London to Copenhagen. The
new Danish building for this was built with Rockefeller money. The first
International Congress in Human Genetics following World War II was held at
this Danish institute in 1956. By that time, Verschuer was a member of the
American Eugenics Society, then indistinguishable from Rockefeller's
Population Council.

Dr. Kallmann helped save Verschuer by testifying in his de-nazification
proceedings. Dr. Kallmann created the American Society of Human Genetics,
which organized the "Human Genome Project'' -- (based at Los Alamos Labs
and in turn the more covert research-and-development projects within the
Dulce, New Mexico base -- which is also involved in researching any and
every form of sophisticated occult-technology imaginable. - Branton) a
current $3 billion physical multiculturalism effort. Kallmann was a
director of the American Eugenics Society in 1952 and from 1954 to 1965.

In the 1950s, the Rockefellers reorganized the U.S. eugenics movement in
their own family offices, with spinoff population-control AND abortion
groups The Eugenics Society changed its name to the "Society for the Study
of Social Biology", its current name.

The Rockefeller Foundation had long financed the eugenics movement in
England, apparently repaying Britain for the fact that British capital and
an Englishman-partner had started old John D. Rockefeller out in his Oil
Trust. In the 1960s, the Eugenics Society of England adopted what they
called Crypto-eugenics, stating in their official reports that they would
do eugenics through means and instruments not labeled as eugenics.

With support from the Rockefellers, the Eugenics Society [England] set up a
sub-committee called the INTERNATIONAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION, which
for 12 years had no other address than the Eugenics Society.

(Note: Margaret Sanger plays a central role in this PLANNED PARENTHOOD
network. And people blast Rush Limbaugh for calling Sanger a "Femi-Nazi"
when in fact that's exactly and literally what it comes down to, when one
considers her full support of the Nazi's 'Aryan' racial supremacy
philosophies. In the 1980's there were an estimated 50 MILLION or more
abortions worldwide, many of which can be attributed to the genocidal
agendas of PLANNED PARENTHOOD. In her book 'PIVOT OF CIVILIZATION', in
reference to free MATERNITY care for the poor, Sanger states: "Instead of
DECREASING and aiming to ELIMINATE THE STOCKS that are most detrimental to
the future of the race and the world it tends to render them to a menacing
degree dominant." And in reference to her 'Negro Project' of the late
1930's, which aimed at recruiting black ministers, physicians and political
leaders for the purpose of encouraging birth control and sterilization in
the black community, Sanger wrote: "...We do not want word to go out that
WE WANT TO EXTERMINATE THE NEGRO POPULATION, and the minister is the man
who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more
rebellious members." Since Sanger is part of the 'ARYAN' SUPREMACY agenda,
it is remarkable that she would allow information about Planned
Parenthood's REAL genocidal agenda to slip out through her writings. The
core issue of most of the incendiary pro-abortion / anti-abortion arguments
should not be whether a Mother's right to KILL a human being with a beating
heart supersedes a child's right to LIVE. That's merely a means that
Planned Parenthood has used to conceal their Fascist genocidal agendas --
that is to hide them behind divisive arguments about 'Constitutional
Rights' of Mothers vs. those of children. The CORE issue should be whether
or not fascist white supremacists should commit genocide against targeted
'non-Aryan' races through abortion, sterilization, infanticide, and other
methods. - Branton),

This, then, is the private, international apparatus which has set the world
up for a global holocaust, UNDER THE 'U.N.' FLAG.
