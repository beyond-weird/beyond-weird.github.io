Major Gordon Cooper

One of the original Mercury Astronauts and the last American to fly in
space alone. On May 15, 1963 he shot into space in a Mercury capsule for a
22 orbit journey around the world. During the final orbit, Major Gordon
Cooper told the tracking station at Muchea (near Perth Australia) that he
could see a glowing, greenish object ahead of him quickly approaching his
capsule. The UFO was real and solid, because it was picked up by Muchea's
tracking radar.

Cooper's sighting was reported by the National Broadcast Company, which was
covering the flight step by step; but when Cooper landed, reporters were
told that they would not be allowed to question him about the UFO sighting.

Major Cooper was a firm believer in UFOs. Ten years earlier, in 1951 he had
sighted a UFO while piloting an F-86 Sabrejet over Western Germany. They
were metallic, saucer-shaped discs at considerable altitude and could
out-maneuver all American fighter planes.

Major Cooper also testified before the United Nations:

"I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are
visiting this planet from other planets... Most astronauts were reluctant
to discuss UFOs."

"I did have occasion in 1951 to have two days of observation of many
flights of them, of different sizes, flying in fighter formation, generally
from east to west over Europe."

And according to a taped interview by J. L. Ferrando, Major Cooper said:

"For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all
specialists in astronautics. I can now reveal that every day, in the USA,
our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to
us. And there are thousands of witness reports and a quantity of documents
to prove this, but nobody wants to make them public.

Why? Because authority is afraid that people may think of God knows what
kind of horrible invaders. So the password still is: We have to avoid panic
by all means."

"I was furthermore a witness to an extraordinary phenomenon, here on this
planet Earth. It happened a few months ago in Florida. There I saw with my
own eyes a defined area of ground being consumed by flames, with four
indentions left by a flying object which had descended in the middle of a
field. Beings had left the craft (there were other traces to prove this).
They seemed to have studied topography, they had collected soil samples
and, eventually, they returned to where they had come from, disappearing at
enormous speed...I happen to know that authority did just about everything
to keep this incident from the press and TV, in fear of a panicky reaction
from the public."

Ed White & James McDivitt

In June 1965, astronauts Ed White (first American to walk in space) and
James McDivitt were passing over Hawaii in a Gemini spacecraft when they
saw a weird-looking metallic object. The UFO had long arms sticking out of
it. McDivitt took pictures with a cine-camera. Those pictures have never
been released.

James Lovell and Frank Borman

In December 1965, Gemini astronauts James Lovell and Frank Borman also saw
a UFO during their second orbit of their record-breaking 14 day flight.
Borman reported that he saw an unidentified spacecraft some distance from
their capsule. Gemini Control, at Cape Kennedy told him that he was seeing
the final stage of their own Titan booster rocket. Borman confirmed that he
could see the booster rocket all right, but that he could also see
something completely different.

During James Lovell's flight on Gemini 7:


Lovell:   BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH.

Capcom:   This is Houston. Say again 7.
Lovell:   SAID WE HAVE A BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH.

Capcom:   Gemini 7, is that the booster or is that an actual sighting?
Lovell:   WE HAVE SEVERAL...ACTUAL SIGHTING.

Capcom:   ...Estimated distance or size?
Lovell:   WE ALSO HAVE THE BOOSTER IN SIGHT...

Neil Armstrong & Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin

According to the NASA Astronaut Neil Armstrong the Aliens have a base on
the Moon and told us in no uncertain terms to get off and stay off the
Moon.

According to hitherto un-confirmed reports, both Neil Armstrong and Edwin
"Buzz" Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that historic landing on the Moon in
Apollo 11 on 21 July 1969. I remember hearing one of the astronauts refer
to a "light" in or on a crater during the television transmission, followed
by a request from mission control for further information. Nothing more was
heard.

According to a former NASA employee Otto Binder, unnamed radio hams with
their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting
outlets picked up the following exchange:


NASA:     Whats there?
          Mission Control calling Apollo 11...

Apollo11: These "Babies" are huge, Sir! Enormous!
          OH MY GOD! You wouldn't believe it!
          I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there,
          Lined up on the far side of the crater edge!
          They're on the Moon watching us!

A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was engaged in a
discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium.


Professor:     What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11?

Armstrong:     It  was incredible, of course we had always  known
               there  was  a possibility, the fact  is,  we  were
               warned  off!(by the Aliens). There was  never  any
               question then of a space station or a moon city.

Professor:     How do you mean "warned off"?

Armstrong:     I can't go into details, except to say that  their
               ships  were far superior to ours both in size  and
               technology  - Boy, were they big!...and  menacing!
               No, there is no question of a space station.

Professor:     But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?

Armstrong:     Naturally  - NASA was committed at that time,  and
               couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was  a
               quick scoop and back again.

According to a Dr. Vladimir Azhazha:

"Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large,
mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon
module. But this message was never heard by the public -- because NASA
censored it."

According to a Dr. Aleksandr Kasantsev, Buzz Aldrin took color movie film
of the UFOs from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and
Armstrong went outside.

Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further
detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up.

Donald Slayton

Donald Slayton a Mercury astronaut revealed in an interview he had seen
UFOs in 1951:

"I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. I
was at about 10,000 feet on a nice, bright, sunny afternoon. I thought the
object was a kite, then I realized that no kite is gonna fly that high."

As I got closer it looked like a weather balloon, gray and about three feet
in diameter. But as soon as I got behind the darn thing it didn't look like
a balloon anymore. It looked like a saucer, a disk.

About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me --
and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a
little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It
pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat
disappeared."

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Major Robert White

On July 17, 1962 Major Robert White reported a UFO during his
fifty-eight-mile high flight of an X-15. Major White reported:

"I have no idea what it could be. It was grayish in color and about thrity
to forty feet away."

Then according to a Time Magazine article, Major White exclaimed over the
radio:

"There ARE things out there! There absolutely is!"

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


NASA Pilot Joseph A. Walker

On May 11, 1962 NASA pilot Joseph Walker said that one of his tasks was to
detect UFOs during his X-15 flights. He had filmed five or six UFOs during
his record breaking fifty-mile-high flight in April, 1962. It was the
second time he had filmed UFOs in flight. During a lecture at the Second
National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space Research in Seattle,
Washigton he said:

"I don't feel like speculating about them. All I know is what appeared on
the film which was developed after the flight." - Joseph Walker

To date none of those films has been released to the public for viewing.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Commander Eugene Cernan

Eugene Cernan was commander of Apollo 17. In a Los Angeles Times article in
1973 he said, about UFOs:

"...I've been asked (about UFOs) and I've said publicly I thought they
(UFOs) were somebody else, some other civilization."

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


NASA's Maurice Chatelain

In 1979 Maurice Chatelain, former chief of NASA Communications Systems
confirmed that Armstrong had indeed reported seeing two UFOs on the rim of
a crater. Chatelain believes that some UFOs may come from our own solar
system -- specifically Titan.

"The encounter was common knowledge in NASA, but nobody has talked about it
until now."

"...all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and
sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin
- flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name. Every
time it occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered
absolute silence."

"I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was the first of the
astronauts to use the code name 'Santa Claus' to indicate the presence of
flying saucers next to space capsules. However, his announcements were
barely noticed by the general public. It was a little different when James
Lovell on board the Apollo 8 command module came out from behind the moon
and said for everybody to hear: 'PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THERE IS A SANTA
CLAUS.' Even though this happened on Christmas Day 1968, many people sensed
a hidden meaning in those words."

The rumors persist. NASA may well be a civilian agency, but many of its
programs are funded by the defence budget and most of the astronauts are
subject to military security regulations. Apart from the fact that the
National Security Agency screens all films and probably radio
communications as well. We have the statements by Otto Binder, Dr. Garry
Henderson and Maurice Chatelain that the astronauts were under strict
orders not to discuss their sightings. And Gordon Cooper has testified to a
United Nations committee that one of the astronauts actually witnessed a
UFO on the ground. If there is no secrecy, why has this sighting not been
made public?

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------


NASA's Scott Carpenter

"At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was a
constant surveillance by UFOs."
