 [PART 12]

Chapter 3 -- RACE HYGIENE:

Three Bush Family Alliances

"The [government] must put the most modern medical means in the
service of this knowledge.... Those who are physically and mentally
unhealthy and UNWORTHY must not perpetuate their suffering in the 
body of their children.... The prevention of the faculty and opportunity to
procreate on the part of the physically degenerate and mentally sick,
over a period of only 600 years, would ... free humanity from an
immeasurable misfortune." See #1

"The per capita income gap between the developed and the develop-
ing countries is increasing, in large part the result of higher birth
rates in the poorer countries.... Famine in India, unwanted babies in
the United States, poverty that seemed to form an unbreakable chain
for millions of people -- how should we tackle these problems?.... It
is quite clear that one of the major challenges of the 1970s ... will
be to curb the world's fertility."

These two quotations are alike in their mock show of concern for human
suffering, and in their cynical remedy for it: Big Brother must prevent
the "unworthy" or "unwanted" people from living.

Let us now further inquire into the family background of our President,
so as to help illustrate how the second quoted author, "George Bush"
Note #1 came to share the outlook of the first, "Adolf Hitler". Note #2

We shall examine here the alliance of the Bush family with three other
families: "Farish, Draper" and "Gray."

The private associations among these families have led to the President's
relationship to his closest, most confidential advisers.  These alliances
were forged in the earlier Hitler project and its immediate aftermath.
Understanding them will help us to explain George Bush's obsession
with the supposed overpopulation of the world's non-Anglo-Saxons [non-
whites], and the dangerous means he has adopted to deal with this 
"problem."

Bush and Farish

When George Bush was elected vice president in 1980, Texas mystery
man William Stamps Farish III took over management of all of George
Bush's personal wealth in a "blind trust." Known as one of the richest 
men in Texas, Will Farish keeps his business affairs under the most 
intense secrecy. Only the source of his immense wealth is known, not 
its employment. Note #3

Will Farish has long been Bush's closest friend and confidante. He is
also the unique private host to Britain's Queen Elizabeth: Farish owns
and boards the studs which mate with the Queen's mares. That is her
public rationale when she comes to America and stays in Farish's
house. It is a vital link in the mind of our Anglophile President.

President Bush can count on Farish not to betray the violent secrets
surrounding the Bush family money. For Farish's own family fortune
was made in the same Hitler project, in a nightmarish partnership with
George Bush's father.

On March 25, 1942, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold
announced that William Stamps Farish (grandfather of the President's
money manager) had pleaded "no contest" to charges of criminal
conspiracy with the Nazis. Farish was the principal manager of a
worldwide cartel between STANDARD OIL CO. of NEW JERSEY and
the I.G. FARBEN concern. The merged enterprise HAD OPENED the 
Auschwitz slave labor camp on June 14, 1940, to produce artificial rubber 
and gasoline from coal. The Hitler government supplied political opponents
and Jews as the slaves, who were worked to near death and then murdered.

Arnold disclosed that Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as EXXON), 
of which Farish was president and chief executive, had agreed to stop 
hiding from the United States patents for artificial rubber which the company 
had provided to the Nazis. Note #4

A Senate investigating committee under Senator (later U.S. President)
Harry Truman of Missouri had called Arnold to testify at hearings on
corporations' collaboration with the Nazis. The Senators expressed
outrage at the cynical way Farish was continuing an alliance with the
Hitler regime that had begun back in 1933, when Farish became chief
of Jersey Standard. Didn't he know there was a war on?

The Justice Department laid before the committee a letter, written
to Standard president Farish by his vice president, shortly after the
beginning of World War II (September 1, 1939) in Europe. The letter
concerned a renewal of their earlier agreements with the Nazis:

Report on European Trip Oct. 12, 1939 Mr. W.S. Farish 30 Rockefeller
Plaza

Dear Mr. Farish:

... I stayed in France until Sept. 17th.... In England I met by appoint-
ment the Royal Dutch [Shell Oil Co.] gentlemen from Holland, and
... a general agreement was reached on the necessary changes in
our relations with the I.G. [FARBEN], in view of the state of war....
[T]he Royal Dutch Shell group is essentially British.... I also had
several meetings with ... the [British] Air Ministry....

I required help to obtain the necessary permission to go to Holland....
After discussions with the [American] Ambassador [Joseph Kennedy]
.. the situation was cleared completely.... The gentlemen in the Air
Ministry ... very kindly offered to assist me [later] in reentering England....

Pursuant to these arrangements, I was able to keep my appointments
in Holland [having flown there on a British Royal Air Force bomber],
where I had three days of discussion with the representatives of I.G.
They delivered to me assignments of some 2,000 foreign patents and
"we did our best to work out complete plans for a modus vivendi which
could operate through the term of the war, whether or not the U.S.
came in...." [emphasis added]

Very truly yours, F[rank] A. Howard Note #5

Here are some cold realities behind the tragedy of World War II, which
help explain the Bush-Farish family alliance -- and their peculiar close-
ness to the Queen of England:

 Note #b|Shell Oil is principally owned by the British Royal family.
Shell's chairman, Sir Henri Deterding, helped sponsor Hitler's rise
to power, Note #6 by arrangement with the Royal Family's Bank of
England Governor, Montagu Norman. Their ally, Standard Oil, would
take part in the Hitler project right up to the bloody, gruesome end.

 Note #b|When grandfather Farish signed the Justice Department's
consent decree in March 1942, the government had already started
picking its way through the tangled web of world-monopoly oil and
chemical agreements between Standard Oil and the Nazis. Many
patents and other Nazi-owned aspects of the partnership had been
seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian.

Uncle Sam would not seize Prescott Bush's Union Banking Corpor-
ation for another seven months.

The Bush-Farish axis had begun back in 1929. In that year, the
Harriman bank bought Dresser Industries, supplier of oil-pipeline
couplers to Standard and other companies. Prescott Bush became
a director and financial czar of Dresser, installing his Yale classmate
Neil Mallon as chairman. Note #7 George Bush would later name one
of his sons after the Dresser executive.

William S. Farish was the main organizer of the Humble Oil Co. of
Texas, which Farish merged into the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey. Farish built up the Humble-Standard empire of pipelines and
refineries in Texas. Note #8

The stock market crashed just after the Bush family got into the oil
business. The world financial crisis led to the merger of the Walker-
Harriman bank with Brown Brothers in 1931. Former Brown partner
Montagu Norman and his protege Hjalmar Schacht, who was to become
Hitler's economics minister, paid frantic visits to New York that year
and the next, preparing the new Hitler regime for Germany.

The Congress on Eugenics

The most important American political event in those preparations for
Hitler was the infamous Third International Congress on Eugenics, held
at New York's American Museum of Natural History August 21-23, 1932,
supervised by the International Federation of Eugenics Societies. Note
#9. This meeting took up the stubborn persistence of African-Americans
and other allegedly "inferior" and "socially inadequate" groups in repro-
ducing, expanding their numbers, and "amalgamating" with others. It
was recommended that these "dangers" to the "better" ethnic groups
and to the "well-born," could be dealt with by sterilization or "cutting
off the bad stock" of the "unfit."

Italy's FASCIST government sent an official representative. Averell
Harriman's sister Mary, director of "entertainment" for the Congress,
lived down in Virginia fox-hunting country; her state supplied the
speaker on "racial purity," W.A. Plecker, Virginia commissioner of
vital statistics. Plecker reportedly held the delegates spellbound
with his account of the struggle to stop race-mixing and interracial
sex in Virginia.

The Congress proceedings were dedicated to Averell Harriman's mother;
she had paid for the founding of the race-science movement in America
back in 1910, building the Eugenics Record Office as a branch of the
Galton National Laboratory in London. She and other Harrimans were
usually escorted to the horse races by old George Herbert Walker --
they shared with the Bushes and the Farishes a fascination with
"breeding thoroughbreds" among horses and humans. Note #1 Note #0

Averell Harriman personally arranged with the Walker/Bush Hamburg-
Amerika Line to transport Nazi ideologues from Germany to New
York for this meeting. Note #1 Note #1 The most famous among those
transported was Dr. Ernst Rudin, psychiatrist at the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin, where the ROCKE-
FELLER family paid for Dr. Rudin to occupy an entire floor with his
eugenics "research." Dr. Rudin had addressed the International
Federation's 1928 Munich meeting, speaking on "Mental Aberration
and Race Hygiene," while others (Germans and Americans) spoke on
race-mixing and sterilization of the unfit. Rudin had led the German
delegation to the 1930 Mental Hygiene Congress in Washington, D.C.

At the Harrimans' 1932 New York Eugenics Congress, Ernst Rudin
was unanimously elected President of the International Federation of
Eugenics Societies. This was recognition of Rudin as founder of the
German Society for Race Hygiene, with his co-founder, Eugenics
Federation vice president Alfred Ploetz.

As depression-maddened financiers schemed in Berlin and New
York, Rudin was now official leader of the world eugenics movement.
Components of his movement included groups with overlapping
leadership, dedicated to:

 Note #b|sterilization of mental patients ("mental hygiene societies");

 Note #b|execution of the insane, criminals and the terminally ill
("euthanasia societies"); and

 Note #b|eugenical race-purification by prevention of births to
parents from 'inferior' blood stocks ("birth control societies").

Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household word, these
British-American-European groups called openly for the elimination of
the "unfit" by means including force and violence. Note #1 Note #2

Ten months later, in June 1933, Hitler's interior minister Wilhelm
Frick spoke to a eugenics meeting in the new Third Reich. Frick called
the Germans a "degenerate" race, denouncing one-fifth of Germany's
parents for producing "feeble-minded" and "defective" children. The
following month, on a commission by Frick, Dr. Ernst Rudin wrote
the "Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity," the
sterilization law modeled on previous U.S. statutes in Virginia and
other states.

Special courts were soon established for the sterilization of German
mental patients, the blind, the deaf, and alcoholics. A quarter million
people in these categories were sterilized. Rudin, Ploetz, and their
colleagues trained a whole generation of physicians and PSYCHI-
ATRISTS -- as sterilizers and as killers.

[Note: Adolph Hitler was not the sole source of such genocidal
policies -- they were in fact an integral part of the overall Nazi philo-
sophy from the beginning. - Wol.]

When the war started, the eugenicists, doctors, and psychiatrists
staffed the new "T4" agency, which planned and supervised the mass
killings: first at "euthanasia centers," where the same categories
which had first been subject to sterilization were now to be murdered,
their brains sent in lots of 200 to experimental psychiatrists; then
at slave camps such as Auschwitz; and finally, for Jews and other 
race victims, at straight extermination camps in Poland, such as 
Treblinka and Belsen. Note #1 Note #3

In 1933, as what Hitler called his "New Order" appeared, JOHN D.
ROCKEFELLER, Jr. appointed William S. Farish the chairman of Stan-
dard Oil Co. of New Jersey (in 1937 he was made president and chief
executive). Farish moved his offices to Rockefeller Center, New York,
where he spent a good deal of time with Hermann Schmitz, chairman
of I.G. Farben; his company paid a publicity man, Ivy Lee, to write
pro-I.G. Farben and pro-Nazi propaganda and get it into the U.S. press.

Now that he was outside of Texas, Farish found himself in the shipping
business -- like the Bush family. He hired Nazi German crews for
Standard Oil tankers. And he hired "Emil Helfferich," chairman of the
Walker/Bush/Harriman Hamburg-Amerika Line, as chairman also of the
Standard Oil Company subsidiary in Germany. Karl Lindemann, board
member of Hamburg-Amerika, also became a top Farish-Standard exec-
utive in Germany. Note #1 Note #4

This interlock between their Nazi German operations put Farish together
with Prescott Bush in a small, select group of men operating from
abroad through Hitler's "revolution," and calculating that they would
never be punished.

In 1939, Farish's daughter Martha married Averell Harriman's nephew,
Edward Harriman Gerry, and Farish in-laws became Prescott Bush's
partners at 59 Broadway. Note #1 Note #5

Both Emil Helfferich and Karl Lindemann were authorized to write
checks to Heinrich Himmler, chief of the Nazi SS, on a special
Standard Oil account. This account was managed by the German-
British-American banker, Kurt von Schroeder. According to U.S.
intelligence documents reviewed by author Anthony Sutton, Helfferich
continued his payments to the SS into 1944, when the SS was super-
vising the mass murder at the Standard-I.G. Farben Auschwitz and
other death camps. Helfferich told Allied interrogators after the war
that these were not his personal contributions -- they were corporate
Standard Oil funds. Note #1 Note #6

After pleading "no contest" to charges of criminal conspiracy with the
Nazis, William Stamps Farish was fined $5,000. (Similar fines were
levied against Standard Oil -- $5,000 each for the parent company
and for several subsidiaries.) This of course did not interfere with the
millions of dollars that Farish had acquired in conjunction with Hitler's
New Order, as a large stockholder, chairman, and president of
Standard Oil. All the government sought was the use of patents which
his company had given to the Nazis -- the Auschwitz patents -- but
had withheld from the U.S. military and industry.

But a war was on, and if young men were to be asked to die fighting
Hitler .. something more was needed. Farish was hauled before the
Senate committee investigating the national defense program. The
committee chairman, Senator Harry Truman, told newsmen before
Farish testified: "I think this approaches treason." Note #1 Note #7

Farish began breaking apart at these hearings. He shouted his
"indignation" at the senators, and claimed he was not "disloyal."

After the March-April hearings ended, more dirt came gushing out of
the Justice Department and the Congress on Farish and Standard Oil.
Farish had deceived the U.S. NAVY to prevent the Navy from acquiring
certain patents, while supplying them to the Nazi war machine;
meanwhile, he was supplying gasoline and tetraethyl lead to Germany's
submarines and air force. Communications between Standard and I.G.
Farben from the outbreak of World War II were released to the Senate,
showing that Farish's organization had arranged to deceive the U.S.
government into passing-over Nazi-owned assets: They would nominally
buy I.G.'s share in certain patents because "in the event of war between
ourselves and Germany ... it would certainly be very undesireable to
have this 20 percent Standard-I.G. pass to an alien property custodian
of the U.S. who might sell it to an unfriendly interest." Note #1 Note #8

John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (father of David, Nelson, and John D. Rockefeller 
III), the CONTROLLING OWNER of Standard Oil, told the Roosevelt
administration that he knew 'nothing' of the day-to-day affairs of his
company, that all these matters were handled by Farish and other
executives. Note #1 Note #9

In August, Farish was brought back for more testimony. He was now
frequently accused of LYING. Farish was crushed under the intense,
public grilling; he became morose, ashen. While Prescott Bush escaped
publicity when the government seized his Nazi banking organization in
October, Farish had been nailed. He collapsed and died of a heart
attack on November 29, 1942.

The Farish family was devastated by the exposure. Son William Stamps
Farish, Jr., a lieutenant in the Army Air Force, was humiliated by the
public knowledge that his father was fueling the enemy's aircraft; he
died in a training accident in Texas six months later. Note #2 Note #0

With this double death, the fortune comprising much of Standard Oil's
profits from Texas and Nazi Germany was now to be settled upon the
little four-year-old grandson, William ("Will") Stamps Farish III. Will
Farish grew up a recluse, the most secretive multimillionaire in Texas, 
with investments of "that money" in a multitude of foreign countries, 
and a host of exotic contacts overlapping the intelligence and financial 
worlds -- particularly in Britain.

The Bush-Farish axis started George Bush's career. After his 1948
graduation from Yale (and the Skull and Bones secret society), George
Bush flew down to Texas on a corporate jet and was employed by his
father's DRESSER INDUSTRIES. In a couple of years he got help from 
his uncle, George Walker, Jr., and Farish's British banker friends, to 
set him up in the oil property speculation business. Soon thereafter,
George Bush founded the ZAPATA Oil Company, which put oil drilling
rigs into certain locations of great strategic interest to the Anglo-
American intelligence community. ["Zapata" was allegedly a code word
used by these same mega-bankers describing the first Communist
Revolution which they had financially backed -- as they had done with
the Nazi's themselves. - Wol.]

Twenty-five-year-old Will Farish was personal aide to Zapata chairman
George Bush in Bush's unsuccessful 1964 campaign for Senate. Farish
used "that Auschwitz money" to back George Bush financially, investing
in Zapata. When Bush was elected to Congress in 1966, Farish joined
the Zapata board. Note #2 Note #1

When George Bush became U.S. vice president in 1980, the Farish and
Bush family fortunes were again completely, secretly commingled. As 
we shall see, the old projects were now being revived on a breathtaking
scale.
