"During the Third Reich even 'the party liners' who lived around 'the death
camps' were reluctant to believe that 'their government' could commit such
horrendous crimes as were discovered after the invasion of Germany. Yet,
although they heard faint screams in the far distance and cries for help --
they SHUT THEIR EARS TO IT. Even though they saw carloads of people by the
thousands going into the concentration camps -- and none return -- THEY
SHUT THEIR EYES TO IT. Even when they saw billows of smoke belch from the
bowels of the burners and smelt the stiff strong stench of burning flesh --
THEY SHUT THEIR SENSES TO IT. And, in spite of the fact rumor had it that
'unspeakable horrors' were going on in the 'killing camps' - THEY SHUT
THEIR MINDS TO IT.

"Those that asked local government officials, like yourself, WHAT WAS GOING
ON were told that it was all 'TOP SECRET' and involved 'NATIONAL
SECURITY'.....and NOT TO QUESTION AUTHORITY. Then one day when the war came
to a close and the truth was unearthed, the 'party people' acted shocked
when it became public that millions had been mass-murdered. They just
couldn't believe that genocide, infanticide and homicide could have been
not only allowed but carried out to the last deadly detail by other 'party
liners' in the government who just went along...... saw nothing, said
nothing and did nothing.

"When it came time for the TRIAL at Nuremberg, Mrs. Cafferata, the 'Vun,
Vurid, Vurkers' who ran the killer concen- tration camps at Auschwitz and
Dachau -- 'CLAIMED INNOCENCE'. Even those 'party people' who shoved and
shoveled their victims into those carnivorous crematoriums - 'CLAIMED
INNOCENCE'. THEY SAID THEY WERE JUST OBEYING ORDERS. They said they were
merely carrying out the MASTER PLAN -- for the Master Race.

"I am not accusing you of any crime, Mrs. Cafferata. It is possible that
you could just be so inordinately apathetic or just so blindly obeying
orders that you cannot see, or simply refuse to open your eyes to what's
going on. Or do you 'CLAIM INNOCENCE', Mrs. Cafferata? The Attorney
General's office will be the judge of that. It is the A.G.'s responsibility
to determine if any crimes have been, or are now being committed or allowed
'to be committed' by your office. Ultimately, any decision with regards to
the 'wholesale abuse of the law' is made by the prosecution who tries the
case, be it in a court of law or before the bar of public opinion..."

"Sincerely, Anthony J. Hilder - RADIO FREE AMERICA"

Perhaps those of us who read these words should heed the battle-cry of the
Jews when they say: "NEVER AGAIN!!!"

In the early 1990's an avowed high-level Intelligence Worker in the U.S.
Government who refers to himself only as "Commander X", for his own
protection, 'spilled the beans' on a key secret concerning the interaction
and conflict taking place below the Mojave Desert, against the Gray Empire
which had entrenched itself in the subterranean levels of the Southwest:

"The underground...base outside of Dulce, New Mexico, is perhaps the one
MOST FREQUENTLY referred to. It's existence is most widely known, including
several UFO abductees who have apparently been taken there for examination
and then either managed to escape or were freed just in the nick of time by
friendly...forces.

"According to UFO conspiracy buff and ex-Naval Intelligence Officer Milton
(William) Cooper, '...a confrontation broke out between the human
scientists and the Aliens at the Dulce underground lab. The Aliens took
many of our scientists hostage. Delta Forces were sent in to free them but
they were no match for the Alien weapons. Sixty-six people were killed
during this action. As a result we withdrew from all joint projects for at
least two years...'

"CENTURIES AGO, SURFACE PEOPLE (some say the ILLUMINATI) entered into a
pact with an 'Alien nation' HIDDEN WITHIN THE EARTH." Commander X alleges.
"The U.S. Government, in 1933, agreed to trade animals in exchange for
high-tech knowledge, and to allow them to use (undisturbed) UNDERGROUND
BASES, in the Western U.S.A. A special group was formed to deal with the
'Alien' beings. In the 1940's 'Alien Life Forms' (ALF) began shifting their
focus of operations, FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, TO THE U.S.A.

"The CONTINENTAL DIVIDE is vital to these 'entities.' Part of this has to
do with magnetics (substrata rock) and high energy states (plasma)... This
area has a very high concentration of lightning activity; underground
waterways and cavern systems; fields of atmospheric ions; etc..."

The following is taken from an article by 'TAL' LeVesque, titled 'THE
COVERT RETURN OF AN ALIEN SPECIES OF REPTILIAN HERITAGE - THE DULCE BASE,'
which appeared in a mailer-newsletter distributed by researcher Patrick
O'Connel:

According to TAL, ages ago "...a CONFLICT with other beings (ELs) destroyed
most of their (Reptilian) civilization, which forced some into DEEP CAVERNS
& others to LEAVE EARTH (to Alpha Draconis and/or Altair in the
constellation Aquila, which in ancient lore was associated with evil
reptilian creatures)... The conflict is a Species War, between the Evadamic
Seed & the 'Serpent' (draconian) Seed."

(Note: Researcher Maurice Doreal claims that this "conflict" took place
between giant humans or 'ELs' working with PRE- NORDICS based in the Gobi
region of Asia several thousand years ago, and Reptilian hominoids based in
Antarctica! - Branton)

"Under cover of darkness, with bases hidden inside the earth, this
nocturnal invader has chosen to reclaim what was once theirs & use it (and
us) as a staging area in their ancient conflict with the 'ELs'. (Note: That
is, the reptilians wish to 'reclaim' that which they WANT US TO BELIEVE was
once theirs. The 'ELs' are the so-named EL-der race, a human-like culture
tied into the Evadamic heritage yet who have attained or retained a very
tall physical stature, in some cases being twice as tall as the average
'International' or 'surface' Terran. Because of their physical differences,
they have chosen to inhabit exterran, subterran, and according to some
other dimensional realms so as not to induce irrational fear or worship of
themselves by their more diminutive human cousins - Branton)

"Humans with alien brain implants (the 'zombies') have been programmed to
help overthrow Mankind in the NEAR FUTURE. The 'Reptoids' are even able TO
TRANSFORM THEMSELVES INTO BEINGS WITH HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS & FEATURES. The
planet Earth is being stressed so that human resistance will be minimal,
during the overt takeover & control of Mankind.

"It started as a 'joint interaction program.' An Alien Species wanted to
'share' parts of it's advanced technology with certain humans in KEY
POSITIONS OF POWER within government, military, corporations, 'secret
societies', etc... The population as a whole began to be manipulated into
the 'Alien Agenda'... they wanted TOTAL CONTROL of us!"

(Note: When this was written, the real name of the 'source' of information
described in the following paragraph was with- held and known only as
"T.C." or "Thomas C.". We have now been authorized to reveal the full name
of the former Dulce Base worker as being Thomas Edwin Castello, who
possessed a LEVEL-7 "ULTRA" security clearance within the Dulce facility,
and who was in fact a head of Security within the underground installation.
There are unconfirmed reports that Thomas Castello, after years in hiding,
has finally passed away in Costa Rica. Whether or not his alleged death had
anything to do with his intimate knowledge of the underground bases, is not
known - Branton)

"...T.C (had) seen tall Reptilian Humanoids at the base. This is
interesting to me because in 1979 I came face-to-face with the over 6 foot
tall 'Other' Species (REPTOIDS) which materialized in our home! They took
blood from my wife (who is an Rh-negative blood type); & her daughter, who
was 1500 miles away.

"...We all came to know that the 'Visitors' were here to stay. We also
learned how the Reptilian Race was RETURNING to Earth & the 'Greys' -- who
are mercenaries -- WERE BEING USED to interface (with) & manipulate
hu-mans. Their DEMONIC AGENDA was to keep earth surface (mankind) CONFUSED
& unaware of their true nature & potential... ALSO (to conceal) THE
KNOWLEDGE OF VAST & VARIED CIVILIZATIONS LIVING WITHIN THE EARTH.

"The Fantastic Truth was made to seem a fantasy, a legend, a myth, an
illusion! The REPTOIDS are RETURNING to earth to use it as a staging area,
in their ANCIENT CONFLICT with the Elohim (the Creator and the Angelic
forces as described in Revelation chapter 12, who are not to be confused
with the 'ELs' with whom the Reptilians are ALSO in conflict - Branton).
The ADAMIC Race has underground bases within Mars... they are a 'Warrior
Cult' culture.

"...There is a vast network of Tube Shuttle connections under the U.S.,
which extends into a GLOBAL SYSTEM OF TUNNELS & SUB-CITIES... Note: They
(reptilians) DO NOT consider themselves 'Aliens'... they claim Terra (3rd
from the Sun) was their home before we (humans) arrived. (Note: The saurian
grays may have originated on earth and 'developed' or 'mutated' from the
early bi-pedal saurioid species, yet there is much evidence that their
'claim' that this is 'their' planet is merely propaganda designed to
convince the human race that they or we must surrender this world to their
control - Branton).

"...As a species," TAL continues, "the reptilian heritage beings (the
Greys, Reptoids, Winged Draco with 2 horns - the classic stereotype of the
'Devil')... are highly analytical & technologically oriented. They are
seriously into the sciences of automation (computers) & bio-engineering
(genetics)! However, their exploits in these areas has led to reckless
experimentation, WITH TOTAL DISREGARD FOR ETHICS (moral standards) AND
EMPATHY. This is also true of MANY OF THE HUMAN BEINGS WORKING WITH THEM!."

TAL then describes something which might seem unbelievable if it weren't
for the fact that dozens of other sources tend to confirm it. This
discovery was allegedly one of the REAL reasons for the incitation of the
'Dulce Wars':

     "...LEVEL #7 is the worst. Row after row of 1,000's of humans &
     human-mixture remains in cold storage. Here too are embryos of
     humanoids in various stages of development. Also, many human
     childrens' remains in storage vats. Who are (were) these people?"

The sources for these incredibly disturbing allegations aside from Thomas
Castello himself, according to TAL, included:

     "...people who worked in the labs, abductees taken to the base,
     people who assisted in the construction, intelligence personnel
     (NSA, CIA, etc.), and UFO-Inner Earth researchers." This
     information, TAL states, "is meant for those who are seriously
     interested in the Dulce base. For YOUR OWN PROTECTION, be advised
     to 'USE CAUTION' while investigating this complex."

The 'Symbol' for the Dulce Base that is worn on many of the workers there,
allegedly consists of an UPSIDE-DOWN triangle or pyramid with an
upside-down 'T' superimposed over it. William Hamilton added a few comments
in his book 'COSMIC TOP SECRET', concerning studies of the carcasses of
mutilated cattle found near Dulce, New Mexico. These include:

     "...Schoenfeld Clinical Laboratories in Albuquerque analyzed the
     samples (of the affected hides of cattle studied by Gomez and
     Burgess) and found significant deposits of potassium and
     magnesium. The potassium content was 70 times above normal.

     "...Level 1 (of the Dulce base) contains the garage for STREET
     MAINTENANCE. Level 2 contains the garage for TRAINS, SHUTTLES,
     TUNNEL-BORING MACHINES (or what former Dulce-base worker Thomas
     Castello refers to as the "terron drive" - Branton), AND DISC
     MAINTENANCE.

     "...The Greys and reptoid species... have had ancient CONFLICTS
     with the NORDIC humans from outer space societies, and may be
     staging here for a future conflict."

Penny Harper, in the January 1990 issue of 'WHOLE LIFE TIMES', wrote an
article in which she referred to the UFOlogist and prominent physicist Paul
Bennewitz:

"Paul Bennewitz -- whereabouts unknown (Note: A search of a major
laser-disc U.S. telephone database in 1993 revealed only one listing for
'Paul Bennewitz' -- at 120 E. Pebble Beach Dr., Tempe, AZ 85282 --
telephone #602-966-5704. This may or may not be the 'Paul Bennewitz' in
question - Branton). Paul was a scientist investigating an abduction case.
A woman and her son drove down a road in the southwest, the woman witnessed
aliens mutilating a calf. The aliens captured both mother and son, taking
them into an underground installation." The woman saw many frightening
things, apparently much of it similar to what abductees Christa Tilton,
Judy Doraty and others had witnessed, yet they -- mother and son -- also
saw, according to Penny Harper: "...human body parts floating in a vat of
amber liquid. After a horrifying ordeal, the woman and her son were taken
back to their car. Bennewitz was able to determine that there is a secret
'alien' base beneath Dulce, New Mexico. He wrote 'The Dulce Report' and
sent it to the civilian UFO group called APRO (i.e. Aerial Phenomena
Research Organization). Bennewitz was then committed to the New Mexico
State Hospital for the mentally ill where he was given electro-shock
'therapy.' When he was discharged, he publicly stated that he would not
have anything to do with UFOs. He is a recluse today, but still alive, last
I heard."

Again, we quote from Commander X, who has stated:

"...From my own intelligence work within the military, I can say WITH ALL
CERTAINTY that one of the main reasons the public has been kept in total
darkness about the reality of UFOs and 'aliens', is that the truth of the
matter actually exists TOO CLOSE TO HOME TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT. How could a
spokesman for the Pentagon dare admit that five or ten thousand feet
underground EXISTS AN ENTIRE WORLD THAT IS 'FOREIGN' TO A BELIEF STRUCTURE
WE HAVE HAD FOR CENTURIES? How could, for example, our fastest bomber be
any challenge to those aerial invaders when we can only guess about the
routes they take to the surface; eluding radar as they fly so low, headed
back to their underground lair?

"...the 'Greys' or the 'EBEs' have established a fortress, spreading out to
other parts of the U.S. via means of a vast underground tunnel system THAT
HAS VIRTUALLY EXISTED BEFORE RECORDED HISTORY..."

The following account, concerning an area in THE MOJAVE just east of BISHOP
(OWENS VALLEY), CALIFORNIA, was related by Val Valerian in his 'LEADING
EDGE' Newsletter, Dec. 1989 - Jan. 1990 issue. The article, titled: 'DEEP
SPRING'S, CALIFORNIA', stated:

"Deep Springs, California is an area that is becoming known as the site for
very strange events. According to the information released both on the air
on KVEG-AM and from other sources, the area is full of strange people
wandering around in black suits. There have also been rumors that there is
an underground facility in the area. Checking with gravity anomaly maps
proved that there are large cavities under the ground in that area. The
wildest claims relative to the area have stated that alien lifeforms are
being released there... Deep Springs Lake has been probed and it appears
bottomless. Divers have traveled along an underground river 27 miles toward
the Las Vegas area before having to turn around." (This 'river' would
probably have been a 'partially' water- filled passage with a large stream
or river flowing through it, rather than an entirely underwater system,
since 27 miles of travel through entirely underwater passage would most
likely be entirely out of the question, with present diving technology -
Branton).

The following list of 'entity types' or 'aliens' comes from the anonymous
Intelligence worker 'Commander X', as he received them from John Lear and
other 'inside' sources:

"THREE TYPES OF EBE'S (GRAYS): GRAY-1 -- 3 1/2 feet tall. Large head. Large
slanted eyes. Worship technology. Don't give a damn about mankind. GRAY-2
-- Same type, different finger arrangement, slightly different face. More
sophisticated than Gray-1... May not need secretions (large- nosed or
large-muzzled grays? - Branton). GRAYS: Same basic type. Lips thinner. More
subservient to other two grays.

"BLONDES, SWEDES, NORDICS: Known by any of these monikers. Similar to
humans (although it is unknown as to whether they are related to any of the
nationalities mentioned). Blond hair, blue eyes. Will not break (so-called)
'universal law' of 'non-interference' to help us...

"INTER-DIMENSIONAL: Entity that can assume various shapes... (also include
fallen angelics or poltergeists. These often apparently utilize androidal
forms to operate in the 'physical' realm, temporary energy forms, forms
constructed from restructured physical matter, or even physical biological
'shells' constructed from 'mutilated organs' and other materials, etc. -
Branton)

"HAIRY DWARF'S: Four feet tall, 35 lbs. Extremely strong. Hairy (possibly a
degenerate branch of the humanoid Sasquatch - Branton).

"VERY TALL RACE: Look like humans but seven or eight feet tall. United with
Blondes.

"HUMANS APPEARING SIMILAR TO BLONDES SEEN WITH GRAYS: ...Child-like
mentality.

"MIB'S: (Men In Black). Wear all black. Sunglasses. Very pale skin. Do nor
conform to normal accepted patterns; Extremely sensitive to light..."

Researcher Val Valerian has quoted various 'inside' sources who claim that
the Grays are able to use organs taken from mutilated victims to construct
physical 'shells' for their invisible or non-physical
(demoniacal-poltergeist?) masters, allowing them to operate in the
physical. In apparent confirmation, 'Commander X' shows how the Saurians
might be able to 'create' such biogenetic forms:

"...What the government didn't realize was that they (the Grays) planned to
abduct tens of thousands of individuals, plant monitoring devices in their
brains, and program them with specific series' of responses to direct
commands.

"The EBEs -- also behind our backs -- began to mutilate cows and other
animals because they wished to use their tissues TO CREATE A GENETICALLY
ADVANCED RACE OF FLESH AND BLOOD ROBOTS. When the government realized what
the EBEs had in mind, and wanted to back out of their agreement, THE
'ALIENS' TOOK OVER SEVERAL UNDERGROUND BASES WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY
INSTALLED UNDERGROUND LABORATORIES."

On p. 109 of John Keel's book 'THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES', we read the
following concerning an even more alarming possibility in regards to the
reptilian threat:

     "...I am an amateur herpetologist and once kept three-fanged
     cobras in my New York apartment... until my concerned neighbors
     squealed to the Board of Health. SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE
     (alien) ENTITIES IMPRESSED ME AS RESEMBLING SOME KIND OF REPTILE
     RATHER THAN HUMAN MAMMALS. I didn't mention the reptile notion to
     anyone. But on July 24, Lia (an alleged alien tied-in with the
     Men In Black - Branton) visited Jane (a contactee) and refused to
     talk about anything but eggs. She took some eggs from Jane's
     refrigerator and sucked out the contents like a reptile! Jane was
     perplexed by this exhibition and called me soon afterward." And
     on pp. 176-177 of Signet's 1975 paperback edition of 'MOTHMAN
     PROPHECIES', in reference to this same 'contactee' Keel states:

     "...Meanwhile, Jane's phantom friends were visiting her daily and
     helpfully giving her surprising information about my own 'secret'
     investigations. My interview with the Christiansens of Cape May,
     and the details of their pill-popping visitor, Tiny, was then
     known only to a few trusted people like Ivan Sanderson. But on
     June 12, Mr. Apol and his friends (including the creature
     referred to above which called itself 'Lia' - Branton) visited
     Jane when she was alone in her house and asked for water so they
     could take some pills. Then they presented her with three of the
     same pills, told her to take one at that moment, and to take one
     other in two days. The third pill, they said, was for her to
     analyze to assure herself it was harmless. They undoubtedly knew
     she would turn it over to me. Two hours after she took the first
     pill she came down with a blinding HEAD ache, her eyes became
     bloodshot, and her vision in her right eye was affected. When her
     parents came home they expressed concern because her eyes were
     glassy and her right eye seemed to have a cast. The sample pill
     proved to be a SULFA DRUG normally prescribed for infections of
     the urinary tract..." The possible significance of the 'Sulfa'
     drugs will become apparent later on in this File.

In early 1992 the UNIVERSAL Company's Debut Network aired a made-for-TV
version of John Carpenter's movie 'THEY LIVE', which was based on the
premise of an alien race of bulge- eyed (one might imagine
saurian-reptilian?) creatures that had infiltrated human society, disguised
as humans, and which were in the process of subtly taking control of
powerful social, media, economic and political positions. They were
assisted by a small group of 'human power elite' who through subliminal
'mind control', hidden frequency transmitters, television propaganda, etc.,
helped to keep the masses in a constant state of semi- consciousness. Those
who had not caught-on to the alien conspiracy went about their business in
a slightly catatonic state sufficient to keep them 'blind' or 'asleep' to
the point that the aliens and their subversive activities remained just
outside of their conscious perception. It is interesting that John
Carpenter (not to be confused with the well known MUFON investigator)
depicted the attempts of the aliens to "annihilate" human consciousness as
a means to minimizing human resistance, by destroying individual creativity
and programming all human "cattle" to conform to the dictates of the alien
intruders. All of this without humanity even being aware that they were the
mind- slaves of an alien force which they were "programmed" to believe did
not exist.

Also in the movie, secret subliminal messages were broadcast throughout all
levels of society via all branches of the media, keeping the sleeping
masses in a constant state of tranquilized apathy and subservience. A
HORRIFYING prospect to say the lest. Also in the movie, the aliens utilized
'joint' underground bases beneath major cities which were more-or-less the
back-stage of the alien control scenario.

Incidentally, Disneyworld in Florida contains an underground tunnel network
with hidden entrances. The employees of the park use these as a 'back
stage' -- dressing rooms, employee indoctrination centers and other
facilities necessary to keep up THE ILLUSION of 'Disneyworld'. This is of
course all innocent enough, yet John Carpenter in his movie reveals the
idea that the huge underground 'bases' beneath major cities are being used
as 'back stages' in order to keep an infinitely more diabolical 'illusion'
going, with the help of power-elite who are assisting in the covert
subjugation of the masses for personal gain. The movie 'THEY LIVE' was
based on the short story by Ray Nelson, 'Eight O'Clock in the Morning'. One
might wonder where Nelson got the inspiration for his story, especially
when we realize that the subject of the story and the movie itself is very
similar to events which -- according to numerous sources -- are actually
taking place, if we are to accept the MANY accounts which appear in this
and other Files.

Also, in the movie it is the Judeo-Christian element which first 'wakes up'
to what is going on, and who begin the revolutionary 'resistance' movement
in order to destroy the stranglehold of the aliens upon human society...
Could this scenario be somewhat prophetical as the book of Matthew
(13:24-28) seems to suggest?

     'Commander  X' released details of an incident which may well
have come right out of a John Carpenter movie, if not for the fact
that the Commander himself -- from his own high-security position
within the Intelligence Community -- is convinced of its potential
reality:

      	"...Another story comes from a private stationed on the 
surface at Dulce.  He soon realized something mighty 'odd' was 
going on around there, but it took a while to put his finger on it.
     	"'One morning last September, I was working on a routine 
job when another of the young enlistees, a mechanic, came in 
with a small rush job he wanted welded at once.  He had the print 
and proceeded to show me exactly what he wanted.  We are 
both bending over the bench in front of the welder when I happened 
to look directly into his face.  It seemed to suddenly become 
covered with a semi-transparent film or cloud.  His features faded 
and in their place appeared a 'thing' with bulging eyes, no hair 
and SCALES for skin.  I stood and looked at it for about 20 
seconds.  WHATEVER IT WAS stood and looked at me without 
moving.  Then the strange face seemed to fade away, and at 
the same time recede into the ordinary face of the young man 
underneath.  The dissipation of the imposed face lasted or took 
about five seconds before it was completely gone and I was 
standing there weak, my mouth open and staring at the young 
man who had come in with the rush order.  The young 'man' 
did not seem to be conscious of the elapsed time when I had 
observed all this but went right on talking about the job as if 
nothing had happened.
     	"'This is hard to take but I assure you it was still harder 
for me.  No one can realize a jolt you could get from seeing 
anything like this until they have experienced it for themselves.  
It was several days before I had myself convinced that maybe 
after all what I had seen was real and that I was not suffering 
from illusions and the beginning of insanity.  Days passed 
before I saw this particular phenomena again.  The next time 
was later at night at the guard house near the front gate, on 
the way to work.  I had purchased some small items and on 
arriving I went around to the guard house with my slip to retrieve 
my package.  There was only one guard on duty.  I handed 
him the check and he began to look at the package, taking 
his time.  I waited a minute, then happened to look directly 
at him again.  His face began to change.  Again a face of a 
strange creature was imposed.  You could see through the 
imposed face for a few seconds and then it became the only 
one visible (solidified is the word) and again about 20 seconds 
duration.  Again five seconds for dissipation and the guard 
started to move normally again, found my package and gravely 
handed it to me and I walked out without a word being said.'"
	
Since I came across this report from the 'Commander' I 
have as a result of intense research discovered others that 
would seem to confirm it.  Some of the reports speak of the 
"Men In Black" who have terrorized UFO witnesses as being 
in essence reptilian humanoids with a full-scale -- although 
at times not-too-convincing -- 'plastic surgery' job apparently
intended to allow them to operate in human society undetected.  
Some of the early 'infiltrators' betrayed themselves with their 
plastic-artificial appearance, whereas in more recent years 
the 'disquise' has become far more sophisticated and therefore 
harder to detect, especially with the alleged use of laser
holograms to project a human-like facade around their bodies,
assisted by techno-hypnosis and even a bit of molecular
"shape-shifting" according to other sources.  However there 
ARE ways to see through the "facade" of these "chameleons"...

Researcher George Andrews, in his book EXTRATERRESTRIAL 
FRIENDS AND FOES (ILLUMINET PRESS., P.O. Box 2808., 
Lilburn, GA  30226) quotes a statement made by Valdamar 
Valerian, director of LEADING EDGE RESEARCH (P.O. Box 
7530 - STE 58., Yelm, WA  98597-7530):
     "...A friend of mine and four of his friends experimented 
with crystalline structures a year or two ago (mid-1980's - Branton), 
and they figured out how to cut them along certain planes so 
they could actually see the aura or energy field around people.  
That's when they discovered that all people aren't people, or 
the people they thought they were.  It appears that some E.T. 
humanoids have a dark blue ovoid aura.  It so happens that all 
the people they checked that met this criteria also wore dark 
glasses and made every attempt to act like they really wanted 
nothing to do with people in general.
     "They followed one of these people out into the desert where 
he evidently had a trailer.  After waiting until dusk, they made 
a pretense of needing help and knocked on the door.  After a 
short while, the light went on and the man came to the door.  He 
looked normal, EXCEPT THAT HIS PUPILS WERE VERTICAL 
SLITS INSTEAD OF CIRCLES.  It works.  The only trouble is 
that it costs $2,000 to put a pair of those glasses together..."

Several areas across the Western U.S. where surface and/or 
underground military installations exist have reportedly produced 
similar "Chameleon" sightings.  There seems to be a trend which 
involves the infiltration of the CIA and the subsequent 'replacement' 
of CIA personnel, and in turn Military personnel, by alien life forms 
not loyal to planet earth nor to the human race in general.  Aside 
from Dulce, NM and the Nevada Test Site, other areas where these 
sightings have taken place include Deep Springs, CA where 'Men 
In Black" have been sighted, and Dougway, Utah where one woman
by the name of Barbara who worked as a hair stylist claimed she 
one of the HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS transform temporarily into 
an entity with 'reptilian' features.  Another source at Dougway who 
worked in an auto shop claimed that he saw a similar phenomena 
while changing the tires on the car of one Dougway military official.  
It is interesting that there are claims that the 'Dreamland' activity 
of Nevada has been extended to the underground facilities below 
Dougway.

(Note: There have been similar reports as the above emerging from the
Dougway Test Site on the Salt Flats of western Utah, just across the border
from the Nevada Military complex. In fact there are allegations that much
of the joint Alien-Illuminati activity which originated within the Nevada
Military Complex has now moved into the underground facilities which have
and are being constructed beneath Utah and Idaho, now that the Nevada
activity has been the subject of wide exposure by the media. There is one
reported case where a worker at the Dougway Test Site claimed to have seen
a man temporarily transform into a reptilian while he was changing a tire,
but the most interesting case was that of a woman, "Barbara", who worked in
the small town of Dougway as a hair dresser. She worked on many of the base
personnel there. On one occasion a customer who was a high- ranking
military officer at the base came in. While she was working on his 'hair',
she noticed a brief transformation during which she saw the officer turn
into a "reptilian" creature. K.S., a Salt Lake City based UFOlogist, claims
that during an "Open Mind" UFO gathering in the early 1990's, "Barbara"
alleged that while working at Dougway she heard "rumors" that "reptilian
humanoids" were operating "all over" the base. Another former Dougway
worker, Ray White, who was a top secret courier, stated that during his
work at the base [1960's-1970's?] he witnessed an experiment where an
object was "teleported" from one room to another. He also noticed that
high-ranking Russian officers sometimes visited the base. He also claimed
that some of the "people" that he met there were NOT human. When asked what
he thought they were, he did not know, but he did mention that top secret
research into advanced robotics was being carried out at the base -
Branton)

Researcher Val Valerian has, incidentally, described a very similar event.
Valerian has researched alien phenomena and interaction with human beings
since 1969. He spent 18 months in Southeast Asia from 1970-71 as a combat
photographer, where he saw much UFO activity. After spending four years in
England from 1980 to 1984 he gathered all the top research at his disposal
and released what became known as 'The Krill Papers,' forerunner of the
381-page book, 'The Matrix', published in 1987. He began networking with
researchers worldwide and started an organization known as Nevada Aerial
Research Group.

Between 1988 and 1989 he functioned as Nevada State Section Director for
MUFON. In 1990 he was appointed interim Associate Director for UFO Contact
Center International and was a member of the Aerial Phenomenon Research
Organization. In 1988 NAR began issuing a small newsletter detailing
research findings. By 1990, this newsletter became known as 'The Leading
Edge' and has grown to a monthly 100-page publication. The massive 581 page
work entitled MATRIX II was released in 1990. In April of 1991, NAR moved
to Washington State and was renamed as 'Leading Edge Research Group'.
Valerian has a degree both in Civil Engineering and Psychology and had
significant input into Nippon Television investigations on alien
activities, the research that stimulated the production of the 1989 KLAS
award-winning program entitled 'UFO'S: THE BEST EVIDENCE'.

     In June of 1992 Valerian released the following article, titled 
"ALIEN INFILTRATION OF THE MILITARY MEDICAL SYSTEM: 
MADIGAN HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON", in his LEADING EDGE 
newsletter:
    "About a year ago, we ran into SEVERAL PEOPLE who 
stated that they 'had heard' that 'REPTILIAN HUMANOIDS WERE 
WORKING AT A U.S. ARMY HOSPITAL' NEAR FORT LEWIS, 
WASHINGTON.  At that point, these statements were simply 
filed away in 'rumor' status, pending the arrival of something more 
substantial.  Descriptions of the nature of and appearance of alien 
humanoid forms that could be termed 'REPTILIAN' vary widely.
REPTILIAN HUMANOIDS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED IN ITALY 
AS LOOKING VERY LIZARD-LIKE, EVEN WITH TAILS.  Pictures 
showing some of these entities were published in an ITALIAN 
magazine and eventually ended up in the United States in The 
Leading Edge.  Logic would seem to tell us that if alien humanoids 
were in fact in collusion with military medical personnel at a hospital, 
they would not in fact have the appearance of anything other than
humans, or be close enough to humans to blend in.  About a month 
ago, the nature of synchronicity brought me to an espresso bar, 
where I chanced to engage a lady in her early 50's in some small 
conversation about an entirely unrelated matter.  She had been a 
nurse for some twenty years, and sixteen of those twenty years 
had been spent working for the U.S. Army.  She retired from the 
service and was now job hunting in the local area.  She was very
professional, and seemed to know a lot about the nursing field.
     "Gradually, her conversation got around to a 'very unusual place',
Madigan Military Hospital, which is located on Route 5 south of 
Seattle.  She had applied for work at the hospital and noticed 
that it was indeed a hospital unlike any she had ever seen before.  
Madigan is a brand new $150 million dollar facility, built about a 
year or so ago.  From her description, there are small R2D2-type 
robots that shuttle prescriptions between floors, all the equipment 
is prototype 'one-of-a-kind', like laser x-rays and a lot of equipment
that was extremely high tech.  It was not this alone which peaked 
my interest, but a comment she made later.  She made the statement 
that when she entered a specific lab in the hospital, she noticed that 
all the personnel were extremely absorbed in their work -- nothing 
too uncommon about that.  But then she stated that she had the 
thought that some of the equipment looked quite 'alien', AND TWO 
MEN WHO LOOKED EXACTLY ALIKE TURNED AND LOOKED 
AT HER IN RESPONSE TO HER THOUGHT.  She said that THE
EYES OF THESE TWO MEN WERE QUITE PENETRATING AND 
THAT THEY BOTH MOVED IN UNISON.  That got my interest.  She 
then stated that during the tour of the facility, the individual who was 
escorting her said that the top floor of the hospital AND TWO OF 
THE SUB-BASEMENT FLOORS were Top Secret R&D areas and 
were off limits to BOTH military and civilian personnel.  That really 
got my attention.
     "Subsequently, I ran into a cable repairman who was installing 
cable TV in a nearby town, and decided on a hunch to mention to 
him about the strange nature of Madigan.  The hunch paid off.  He 
said he had been involved in the installation of fiber optic networks 
between the floors of the hospital when it was in its construction 
stage, and that there was a three foot space in between the floors 
where the optics ran.
     "Since these observations were the result of her (the nurse's)
preliminary interview, I talked to her about the idea of getting more 
information, since she would be going back at least one more time.  
She agreed to make some tapes of her observations.  The transcript 
of these tapes is as follows:
     "'VISIT TO MADIGAN HOSPITAL -- The entrance to Madigan 
hospital is off of Interstate 5 past Olympia, Washington.  The exit is 
marked as Madigan Hospital, Camp Murray Exit.  As you enter the 
area the hospital sits to the right -- a massive white structure.  As 
you enter the parking lot, there is a pond and sunken area that runs 
through a bridge which connects the 'medical mall' area to a three 
story building that serves as the main core of the hospital, where
the services like x-ray, nuclear medicine and other services are 
performed.
     "'The three story complex is connected to an eight-story tower 
dubbed 'the nursing tower.'  The tower has a floor that is closed off, 
and I could find no access to it.
     "'I entered the front of the hospital, and the lobby was very 
typical, but not typical of a hospital of this size.  I then went to the 
information desk and was greeted by an 'oriental' Specialist 4th 
Class, who was seated.  He seemed very low key and laid back.  
I was directed to Human Resources. 
     "'As I walked through the corridors, I noticed how beautiful and 
calm I was beginning to feel.  The colors are very soft and conducive 
to feeling mellow (a 'tranquil-ized' atmosphere designed to negate 
any apprehensions? - Branton).
     "'The military personnel WERE VERY SLOW-MOVING (which 
has not been my experience in the past, having served five years 
as an Army nurse) and LOW KEY.  I went to the Human Resources 
and asked about an application, and was directed to a Master 
Sergeant - director of personnel.
     "'Having been a medical technologist for the better part 
of 25 years, the equipment I saw at the hospital was far beyond 
anything I have ever seen.  I was shown an area where there was 
a long room with computer banks on both sides where both civilian 
and military personnel were working.  Before entering the room, I 
was asked to stand in front of the door, where I was scanned by 
some beam-like light.  I was told that my thermal pattern was
being recorded in order to permit my entry to the room.
     "'Off this room was another room where procedures were 
conducted on patients, and I noticed that a patient walked over 
and climbed on an exam table.  The procedure they were doing 
always requires that the patient must be sedated, HOWEVER I 
NOTICED THAT THE PHYSICIAN LEANED OVER THE PATIENT 
AND TOUCHED THE PATIENT IN THE CENTER OF THE FORE-
HEAD WITH HIS INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGER OF ONE HAND.
IMMEDIATELY, THE PATIENT FELL INTO A STATE OF SEDATION 
AND THE PROCEDURE WAS STARTED.  What kind of doctor 
can touch a patient in that way and sedate him?
     "'I looked around at the other personnel in the room at this time.
There were two, a Private First Class and a Specialist 4th Class 
at opposite ends of the room from where I was standing.  BOTH 
OF THESE MEN WERE THE SAME SIZE, HAD THE SAME SKIN 
COLOR, AND MOVED IN A VERY DELIBERATE MANNER.  I 
was talking with the Sergeant and happened to say something 
to myself very softly while having the thought how strange these 
people seemed.  BOTH OTHER MEN TURNED AND LOOKED AT 
ME ALMOST AS IF TO STARE AT ME.  I GOT THIS STRANGE 
FEELING.  I had heard before from a friend whose brother had made 
the uncharacteristic comment that 'ALIENS WORKED AT MADIGAN'.  
ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM AND THE MILITARY PERSONNEL 
IN GENERAL THAT I HAD SEEN IN THE HOSPITAL SEEMED TO 
MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY, ALMOST IN SLOW MOTION.  I 
left the area and went back to the Sergeant's office.
     "'A month later, I returned to Madigan with a friend to see, without 
telling her anything of my experience, if she saw and felt the same 
things I did.  She is very sensitive to variations in electromagnetic 
fields, and eventually had a headache and became nauseated.  
There are many other things about this place.  Between the floors 
there are spaces where small robots move to deliver supplies to all 
the wards and other areas in the hospital, according to the Sergeant.  
I was told that there is no reason for personnel to go into these areas 
-- that the robots do all that.  I did see one of the robot devices.  It 
looked like the R2D2 character on 'star wars'. 
    "'My friend and I entered through what is known as the clinic mall.
This area houses the outpatient clinic.  THERE WERE VERY FEW 
PEOPLE THERE FOR SUCH A LARGE CLINIC.  We were told that 
THERE ARE THREE FLOORS BENEATH THE HOSPITAL and one 
floor above that are off limits to ALL PERSONNEL, MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN, and that these areas were classified Top Secret and 
were research and development [R&D] areas.  THERE ARE VERY 
UNUSUAL ANTENNAS ON TOP OF THE HOSPITAL.  The three-story 
main service area has a complex on top of it THAT APPEARS TO 
HAVE NO ENTRANCE AND NO WINDOWS.  Judging from the way 
the hospital is built, there are a lot of 'DEAD AREAS' that comprise 
spaces THAT CANNOT BE ACCESSED FROM THE MAIN SERVICE 
AREA.
     "'The personal feeling we both got being in the hospital WAS 
THAT WE STARTED TO FEEL VERY DRAINED, AND WE BOTH 
EXPERIENCED GETTING A DULL HEADACHE.  It wasn't until we 
had driven SEVERAL MILES from the facility that we started to feel 
better.'"

I came across yet another report, however the exact source of the 
story was not confirmed and therefore should be taken as it.  The 
report stated that sometime during the 1980's a Secretary working 
in the Pentagon noticed a high-ranking Pentagon 'official' who had 
apparently lost a contact lense.  The eye from where the lense fell 
out was NOT human, but instead contained a vertically-slit pupil.  
No one working at the Pentagon seemed to know where the official 
worked although they had apparently assumed that he was supposed 
to be there in some capacity or another.  The Secretary however 
informed her superiors of the strange incident, and immediately 
Security Personnel approached the 'officer' who apparently was 
not aware of his missing contact lens.  The 'man' did not make any 
attempts to resist.  When the 'officials' apartment was searched, 
copies of several sensitive documents on the "Star Wars" or 
"Strategic Defense Initiative" program were discovered.  Apparently 
the entity had been stealing the documents and transmitting their 
contents to some point beyond the planet.  Rumor had it that
the entity was physically examed and it was discovered that its 
internal organs were NOT human...

F. W. Holiday, in his book 'THE DRAGON AND THE DISK' (W.W. Norton & Co.,
Inc. New York, N.Y. 1973) relates some unusual facts concerning the
relationship between serpent or 'dragon' legends and the modern 'UFO'
phenomena:

"...Satanism -- that is to say the religion of the dragon... seems to have
been contemporaneous in BABYLON and Bronze Age Britain. In both countries
it was probably practiced by minority groups and became official only in
times of decadence.

"When Cryus occupied Ur...a form of dragon-worship seems to have been in
vogue. The priests of this cult escaped the Persians by fleeing north with
their PONTIFF (or 'PONTIFEX MAXIMUS', a position which has allegedly been
secretly held in an unbroken chain from Babylon up to modern times -
Branton) into the mountains of Asia Minor. They finally came to rest at a
place called Pergamos in Lydia (western Turkey) and there set up a
religious centre which became known as 'Satan's seat'. St. John said: 'And
to the angel of the church of Pergamos, write: These things saith He [God]
which hath the sharp sword with two edges [judgment and mercy]: I know they
works, and where thou dwellest, EVEN where Satan's seat is...'

"The ROMANS also knew about Satan's seat AND ANNEXED IT INTO THEIR EMPIRE
IN 133 B.C., after the death of Attalus III, the last of the Pergamite
kings. About this period A PLAGUE BROKE OUT IN ROME and prayers were
offered to the Roman 'gods' in vain. It was decided, therefore, to appeal
to Satan at Pergamos.

"The symbol of the cult was A SERPENT and a special ship was sent to Lydia
TO TRANSPORT THE GOD TO ROME. (Most likely a depiction or "idol"
representation of the "god", in that idols among early pagans were
indistinguishable from the so-called "gods" themselves - Branton) There it
was installed as a deity with great pomp. The disease had probably run its
course and the resulting improvement in public health was attributed to
Satan. The new religion was so popular that snakes of inoffensive species
were allowed to glide around at parties -- at least so Seneca says. In
HISTORIA AUGUSTA they are called DRACUNCULI or little dragons.

"The Aesculapian Serpent -- as the 'god' was called -- is shown on a
carving at Pompeii and is unlike anything known to herpetologists. It had
vertical humps and snail-like horns, exactly like the monsters (sea
serpents - Branton) of Scotland and Ireland. A bronze Urarian cauldron in
Rome carries the erect head and neck of the creature modeled in the round.
It is hideous. It has a shovel-like mouth, bulging eyes and tentacles or
sensory-organs hanging on each side of the face.

"No-one, of course, thought that snakes were dragons. The malignant Great
Serpent of Babylonia was TYPHON or Teitan, Satan, the author of
wickedness...

"Politicians, however, never look a gift-horse in the mouth as long as it
produces results. After giving the Roman people carnage in the guise of
circus entertainment, there was no reason for the EMPERORS to shrink from a
little devil-worship. Even the national flag was given the treatment.
Ammianus Marcellinus describes the standard 'PURPUREUM SIGNUM DRACONIS'.
And when Julius Caesar appeared in full regalia as the PONTIFEX MAXIMUS he
was dressed in reddish-purple robes the same as the Pergamite
dragon-priests. The reader can trace the rest of the story in Gibbon's
'RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE'.

"DRAGON-WORSHIP PERSISTED LONG AFTER CHRISTIANITY (and also 'Catholicism?'
- Branton) HAD BEEN PROCLAIMED. Tertullian complained: 'These heretics
magnify the serpent to such a degree as to prefer him even to Christ
himself; for he, they say, gave us the first knowledge of good and evil.'

"...there is a case to be argued that monsters and U.F.O.s are in some way
linked. Abnormal chains of causation tending to frustrate inquiry into the
nature of the phenomena have been reported in both cases. John A. Keel, an
American journalist who has been delving into the mystery for over thirty
years, talks about a 'conspiracy'. He warned me: 'Proceed with great
caution in your Loch Ness work. We are caught up in a series of games which
must be played by "their" rules. Anyone who tries to invent his own rules,
or breaks the basic pattern, soon loses his mind or even his life.' (This
might apply in many cases, except of course in the case of those who are
working for and 'on the side' of a power much 'greater' than the draconian
forces that are apparently working behind much of the 'UFO' and creature'
events. When Jesus sojourned in this world, for instance, he condemned the
serpent race as being in league with the fallen archangel Lucifer-Satan,
and promised his followers that they would have supernatural power and
authority over these 'serpents' if only they would put their trust in Him.
- Branton). Those who think that this is dramatic and absurd may care to
remember the words of St. John:

     "'And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire to come down
     from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them
     that dwell on the earth by THE MEANS of those miracles which he
     had power to do in the sight of the BEAST.'

     "'The beast' that performed these miracles was what the Jews
     called 'The Shining One', 'The Great Serpent' and 'Satan'. If
     this is the underlying truth of the phenomena then Keel's warning
     is by no means too strong."

In relation to the above, during the Dark Ages of Roman Rule, early
'Dracologists' documented many accounts of battles between knights and
dragons or winged and limbed serpents. This "infestation" as it was called
by the early chroniclers, was allegedly halted with the advent of the
spread of Christianity, and the "worms" as they were often referred to were
forced to retreat back into the underworld -- from which they had emerged
-- by the valiant Christian Knights such as St. George and Lancelot, who
vanquished the beasts at every turn.

In 'POPULAR SCIENCE', March 1990 issue, p. 24, we read of an apparently
quite intelligent, predatory lizard which constantly walked upright on two
legs in a remarkable human-like manner, counter balanced by a tail. This
lizard, in fact, may have been the original ancestor of all the reptilian
species throughout this world (and beyond?). If left to it's 'natural'
course (of not so much 'evolution', but rather 'mutation') over the years,
according to some paleontologists, a race of creatures such as described
below might have -- through natural selection and environmental adaptation
-- become more intelligent and 'hominoid' in nature. As its brain and
physical form 'developed', and it's limbs became stronger through 'survival
of the fittest', the 'tails' of such a predatory race may have become
atrophied [as the 'limbs' became atrophied in snakes, a reptilian branch
that apparently 'mutated' in the opposite direction]. The article states:

     "The oldest known dinosaur, HERRERASAURUS... (was) a flyweight
     when compared with some of its ponderous descendants.
     HERRERASAURUS weighed perhaps 300 pounds and stretched a mere six
     to eight feet long. It had enormous claws and small forelimbs,
     showing that it spent much time ambling on two legs. It also had
     a peculiar, double-hinged jaw... that allowed it to clamp down on
     wriggling prey. And its teeth were finely serrated. These
     characteristics...clearly mark HERRERASAURUS as an active flesh
     eater.

     "The site of the fossil find (of the remains of this saurian -
     Branton), the Ischigualasto Formation in northwestern Argentina,
     is the only area in the world where there are no gaps in the
     fossil record across the time zone being investigated."

In reference to the discoveries made by researcher Paul Serano -- a
paleontologist at the University of Chicago, who with colleague Alfredo
Monetta discovered some remains of the bi- pedal saurioid lizard near San
Juan, Argentina -- the article states:

     "Serano says that the very first dinosaur should have lived at
     the time of the rock layer containing HERRERASAURUS, but that
     climate and geological factors combined to keep any fossils from
     being preserved there.

     "'We'll have to concentrate above and below that zone,' says
     Serano, 'Fortunately, those layers are very good. It's likely
     we'll be able to find more interesting fossils there.'

     "The paleontologist won the $500,000 Packard Foundation Award
     last October, which he says will enable him to continue on the
     track of dinosaurs."

The following is apparently a description of the nefarious activities of
the saurian 'Grey' entities, which was submitted to us along with a
miscellaneous collection of UFO data by a Mr. Ray White. We do not know
it's original source, other than the apparent fact that the information
seems to be based on the revelations of a certain 'abductee', and begins by
making reference to the greys as being:

     "...eaters of souls -- harvest(ers) of souls -- placed in huge
     globular depositories -- something extracted, as hemoglobin is
     extracted from blood -- some residue buried in a graveyard not on
     this planet... couldn't move or speak -- couldn't move head --
     tunnel vision -- everything blurred except straight ahead -- they
     have rank -- like an army but not the same -- you know by the way
     they 'talk' to each other -- thumb, 3 fingers, perhaps 1 very
     small -- suction pads on tips of fingers -- our eyes do not pick
     up the real color of their skin, only a color-blind person would
     see their skin as it really is -- she saw them as grayish green
     -- their skin is not their true skin -- it is like a shield they
     use, a protective covering (Note: In a similar manner Kenneth
     Ring, PH,D. in his book 'THE OMEGA PROJECT' -- William Morrow &
     Co., N.Y. 1972., states that, based on abductee reports, the
     'opaque black' eyes of most of the 'Grays' may also be artificial
     'coverings' - Branton) -- their perception of pain is different
     from ours -- one had compassion (Note: In most cases the only
     'greys' described as having 'compassion' are the so-called
     'hybrids', most of which are actually HUMANS conceived from human
     semen and ova taken from abductees, yet which have been
     'genetically altered' through bio-technology and/or artificial
     post- natal gene-spicing with the 'aliens' or other life-forms.
     Just as the 'greys' are allegedly part of a lower saurioid
     hierarchy, the 'hybrids' or 'hubrids' are reportedly the
     slave-workers who work under them - Branton), others did not --
     ship blended into rock -- total camouflage -- HAVE INSTRUMENTS
     THAT CAN CAMOUFLAGE SHIPS AS [like?] ARMY VEHICLES -- when she
     entered the ship, at first she thought that she was going into a
     cave in the rocks -- they take off your clothes right away,
     without your realizing they have done it -- they have a section
     strictly for men, another strictly for women -- they did not
     understand her menstruating -- she had to explain menstrual
     periods to female alien -- cure of cancer in spices and roots --
     deformed babies in some sort of liquid -- some E.T., some human,
     some E.T./human, some deformed baby animals -- failed experiments
     -- they HAVE NOT yet had luck in interbreeding with us --
     offspring survive a certain amount of time, but then die -- their
     metal different from ours, soft but not soft (?) -- they don't
     understand how we bruise so easily, the softness of our skin --
     they were interested in soft spot at top of skull -- they told
     her about her family history, going way back, ALWAYS the terrible
     things, traumatic childhood memories, few seconds each, the
     things she had blocked out, NEVER the happy memories -- they
     can't understand why we aren't more advanced than they are -- we
     limit ourselves -- block knowledge out -- ringing in ears both on
     and off ship -- calf alive but frozen -- different types of
     samples of animal life -- they give birth through naval, not
     vagina -- UBAN -- Starmaster 12' tall -- Night of Lights when
     everyone will see it -- the whole world."

On Oct. 16th, 1992, FOX Network's 'SIGHTINGS' document- ary described
several abduction experiences involving 'grays' and larger 'Reptilian'
entities. One woman alleged that during one encounter with the reptilian
'greys' she saw a 'preying mantis' type of creature working WITH the
saurian greys and which seemed to be the leader. It had HUGE black eyes and
even through the woman despised the greys she felt an even stronger disgust
and hatred for that particular creature. This is not the only case where
reptil-saurian 'predators' and Insectoid 'parasites' (as some have referred
to them) have been seen working together.

Just what are these 'Mantis' like creatures that have been seen WORKING
WITH the greys-reptilians? Some have suggested that they are an extreme
mutation of the reptilian race, while others suggest they are
interdimensional entities of insectoid configuration. John Lear has alleged
that one of the first crash-retrievals of an unidentified aerial disk
involved these 'mantis-like' creatures which were found on board. However
he also states that within a short period following the incident ALL of the
high government officials who investigated that particular case died under
mysterious circumstances. Such a 'coincidence' may seem sinister if not
demoniacal in nature. Like the reptilians themselves, these 'Mantis' like
creatures have usually been described as being deadly and very deceptive
and abusive. It seems as if they operate on an equal basis, and in some
cases a superior basis to the so-called 'Reptilian' AND saurioid 'Gray'
alien groups and possibly the pterodactoids or so-called 'Mothmen' as well.

One source, although unconfirmed, 'claimed' to have seen huge 'Mantis-like'
creatures in a cavern deep below a drill-shaft south of the Kokoweef
mountain area near the Mojave Desert. The account, rather obscure in some
details, was related by way of a Mr. 'Stolz' who knew some individuals who
were involved in modern attempts to break into Earl Dorr's legendary
'underground grand canyon' or river of gold beneath Kokoweef peak. It is
uncertain whether the man in question was lowered down the hole or whether
he allegedly saw the creatures via camera equipment that was lowered down
the drill-shaft.

In his book 'THE SERPENT AND THE SATELLITE' (Philosophical Library, New
York), author F. Alfred Morin reveals on page 343:

     "...In the Jewish legends the serpent is sometimes described as a
     modified reptilian human-like creature indicating that this
     description was also gradually evolving into the symbolism of
     wickedness or Satan into the image and likeness of a man."

The LEADING EDGE RESEARCH GROUP, P.O. Box 481-MU58., Yelm, Washington
98587., published the following 'advertisements' or introductions for two
of their publications. Although these publications contain some
'occult-channeled' metaphysical information of a rather unsubstantiated or
subjective nature, other informations arrive from more down-to-earth (and
thus more substantiating or objective) sources. The first add is as
follows:

Valerian, Valdamar. MATRIX II: THE ABDUCTION AND MANIPULATION OF HUMANS
USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. 3rd Edition. Updated with New Material. LEADING
EDGE RESEARCH GROUP, 1991, 8 1/2 x 11, Velo-Binding, 660 pages, 1400
line-item index. Its first two editions sold out planetwide as of June
1990. It is rumored that some alien species have secured a copy, and the US
Government has also apparently acquired it. The original MATRIX, issued in
1988, set the stage for this incredible piece of work... The book, now in
its 3rd edition, updated in July 1991, encompasses an incredible range of
data which includes precedental research on human abduction by both
government and off-planet forces -- material that other authors will not
speak of and what publishers will not allow themselves to print.

After the book was released, other researchers began to catch on to what
has been occurring. Val Valerian weaves a wide range of interrelated
material into a literary experience that will rock you to the core of your
being -- Included within the book is... data and updates on underground
bases at Dulce and the Nevada Test Site, a large number of illustrations,
maps and charts detailing activity sites, underground installations and
tunnel networks, commentary by John Lear, Robert Lazar and a host of other
top-notch researchers. Valerian takes us through the whole gambit of how,
why, and by whom humans are manipulated, information about government
connections to the abduction process, post-abduction problems, and things
that the abductee can do.

The book is the first to adequately relate research on memory functions
relative to the abduction process, virtual reality machines and Reichian
programming, and mind control by human and alien manipulators. It also
discusses the abduction of human children and how to handle adjustment of
the child to the experience, multi- generational scenarios and cases, human
multi-dimensional anatomy and how it can be manipulated by technology, and
elements of advanced technology possessed by the government. There is more
information about the various species known as the Greys in MATRIX II than
there has been (or probably ever will be) published anywhere... There is
additional data on the Reptilian species who are dominant over the Greys,
and what they may have planned for humans in the coming years. There are
overviews of the processes and rationale for implanting humans, as well as
cross-sections and technical data gleaned from extracted alien implants
during 1991. Electronic space societies (which the Earth will become in the
near future) are discussed.

The book has an incredible spectrum of information about alien influence on
human society, historical facts that are hard to come by, and much much
more. There is just so much data in this book that it would take pages and
pages to describe it... The book is the death- knell for the planetary
domination-based control systems -- the whole domination/control game and
its accompanying social manifestations (and what is ultimately behind them)
are exposed for all to see. MATRIX II and the research of Valerian and
others he includes in his book also spells the end for "classical Ufology"
with its attendant "Ufologists", "experts", and most of the "UFO
organizations" that are here today. It also exposes techniques that
intelligence and security forces use to have influence over people and
teaches you why they are doing it. Through the book, we can see how alien
interaction has affected wave after wave of civilization on this planet,
injecting elements of adverse technology and mind control, and how the
suppression of human awareness is being performed and supported. MATRIX II
is an absolute MUST to have in your library -- you might throw all your
other books on the subject away. LEADING EDGE RESEARCH also offers on a
regular basis, the 100-page newsletter, THE LEADING EDGE. MATRIX II is
$52,50, postpaid.

And then the following 'add', which may seem rather confusing at first,
however when compared with the rest of this File as a whole, one will begin
to see how the following information corroborates with that which other
sources have related:

Again, in reference to the 'serpent races', John A. Keel, in his book 'OUR
HAUNTED PLANET' (1968. Fawcett Publications., Greenwich, Conn.) has stated:

     "...The parahuman Serpent People of the past are still among us.
     They were probably worshipped by the builders of Stonehenge and
     the forgotten ridge-making cultures of South America.

     "...In some parts of the world the Serpent People successfully
     posed as gods and imitated the techniques of the super-
     intelligence. This led to the formation of pagan religions
     centered around human sacrifices. The conflict, so far as man
     himself was concerned, became one of religions and races. Whole
     civilizations based upon the worship of these false gods rose and
     fell in Asia, Africa, and South America. The battleground had
     been chosen, and the mode of conflict had been decided upon.

     "The human race would supply the pawns. The mode of control was
     complicated as usual. Human beings were largely free of direct
     control. Each individual HAD TO CONSCIOUSLY COMMIT HIMSELF TO ONE
     OF THE OPPOSING FORCES...

     "The main battle was for what was to become known as the human
     soul.

     "Once an individual had committed himself, he opened a door so
     that an indefinable something could actually enter his body and
     exercise some control over his subconscious mind. (According to
     Judeo-Christian teaching, THIS would either be the incorruptable
     Spirit of the Messiah or the soul-destroying spirit of
     anti-Christ, the serpent, Satan, etc. Just as nature hates a
     vacuum, so does the human soul and spirit. In other words, what
     Keel is saying is that the human spirit cannot work entirely of
     it's own volition, but must serve as a channel or a vessel of a
     'higher power', whether that power is good or evil. The act of
     'free will' which is given to man is a 'choice' over which of
     these powers to submit to or serve, and to accept personal
     responsibility for that choice. It is the greatest presumption to
     believe that finite beings like ourselves can choose to be
     neutral in this ancient battle between the Angelic forces of
     Light and Life, and the fallen demoniacal powers of Darkness and
     Death. Neither side will allow for 'neutral territory', in this
     case human souls, because the stakes in this Cosmic Conflict are
     too high - Branton).

     "...the Serpent People or OMEGA Group, attacked man in various
     ways, trying to rid the planet of him. But the super-
     intelligence was still able to look over man... God worked out
     new ways of communication and control, always in conflict with
     the Serpent People."

The mysterious "government insider" whose books have been published by Tim
Beckley's Abelard Press of New York, "Commander X," related a very
interesting incident which involved the subterranean mega-complex beneath
Dulce, New Mexico. The story he tells might turn out to be an important
part of the overall puzzle in connection with that which has previously
been related. One of the many accounts concerning this particular alien
'stronghold' -- an underground empire which is apparently attempting to
spread it's borders to the Mojave, where 'they' have met resistance from
relatively more benevolent human forces -- was related by this anonymous
Intelligence Worker, who states:

"...In another case an old illustrator, John D., does very painstaking
work, but during his being on active duty at Dulce he began to act very
queerly. He would write letters to the President informing him of a plot
underway to undermine the government, and to sabotage the base. He began to
draw pictures of American flags, beautifully executed. He drew strange
designs of mechanical devices, began to visit the library and bring back
books on physics and advanced electronics. He hardly knew how to spell the
words.

"He would patiently explain something of a very technical nature which he
shouldn't have understood. When asked what he was raving about and why he
was causing trouble by writing the President, John D. would say that he had
been 'sensitized.'

"'Last year when I was sick (John D. explained), the doctor on the base
gave me sulfanilamide. There is a fifth column in this country that is tied
up with aliens. Selenium is being slipped into SULFA DRUGS, and this
selenium lodges in the bones and makes the body receptive to extremely
short waves, those in the wave band of the brain. Similar to the waves that
can be detected by the encephalograph. About 300,000 people in this country
have been sensitized, and at least seven secret radio stations have been
set up in this country, and they are broadcasting to these sensitized
persons, instructing them in the best way to perform acts of sabotage
against our planet.'"

These claims as given by the Dulce worker, John D., are incredible indeed,
and could easily be dismissed as the ravings of a madman, IF NOT FOR THE
FACT THAT many others are saying basically the same thing, that there is a
movement underway to bring the minds of the masses under the subjection of
some alien force, whether through implantation or other means, and that
these alien powers from all indications intend on bringing humanity under
their control through such manipulations.

Why would the "controllers" use the United States as the major target of
their activity? We believe that this is due to the fact that the United
States is a place that was originally intended by it's 'founding fathers'
to be a refuge for peoples from all nations to come and work out their
collective destinies free from the restrictions of prejudice and
dictatorial or tyrannical rule -- a land where all people could express
their creativity and individual destinies without interferance. This was
their "intention", however it is obvious that the "dream" has not been
fully realized because of collective and governmental compromize of the
principle that "all men are created equal". The United States,
nevertheless, is unlike any other single nation. It is a "melting pot" and
a place where not only international human societies on the surface
CONVERGE and intermingle in a dramatic way, but apparently where human
societies beneath or beyond the earth converge as well. For instance,
according to various accounts, most non- surface human societies who are
aware of earth have their representatives walking among us in our society
(and to a lesser extent, other nations throughout the world).

There is even the possibility presented by some accounts, however strange
as this may seem, that the sauroids or reptilians themselves have their own
chameleon-like (human-'appearing') "representatives" walking among us,
infiltrating our society, for the most part unknown for their true nature.
We have mentioned a few cases previously, however there is another account
of a 'chameleon' entity which may have attempted to infiltrate the Pentagon
itself, in an effort to seize information about U.S. plans for 'Star Wars'
or SDI technology. The unconfirmed account alleged that such a creature was
in fact apprehended after a 'contact lense' it was wearing, while posing as
a high military officer, fell out, revealing a strange eye-arrangement and
a verticaly-slit pupil. The creature was apprehended and studied, and found
to possess a reptilian internal makeup! The apartment where the creature
was staying was searched and numerous copies of sensitive documents
relating to SDI were discovered within, information which 'it' was
apparently sending on to it's superiors.

The U.S., then, seems to be in essence a 'World Scenario', if not a
'universal' scenario in miniature and therefore the 'Conspiracy' sees it as
a most valuable 'prize'. Therefore it would probably not be too 'far out'
to suggest that the war between the human and serpent races from all three
'realms' CONVERGE in the United States and, to be more exact, within the
vicinities of Mt. Archuleta near Dulce, New Mexico (a MAJOR earth-base of
the Reptilian Empire); the Panamint Mountains of California (a MAJOR
earth-base of the Nordic Federation); and the real 'hotbed' of
INNER-Planetary and CYBER (electronic) warfare, the Nevada Test Site.

Linda Dudar of Washington, New Jersey [whose letter appeared in a UFO
research journal, and was later reprinted in Val Valerian's 'LEADING EDGE'
magazine] made the following unusual allegation:

     "...I liked the story of the silver bebe (TSB, Feb. 1990 issue).
     I also had one. I was about 9 years old when it started to bother
     me. I don't know when I got it, but it was under my skin on my
     midriff section, just below my right ribs. I went to the doctor
     and he sent me to the hospital to remove it. I saw when he put it
     in the tray -- a little silver ball about 1/4" around, maybe
     smaller. I also still have the scar.

     "Dr. Mundy, a therapist who speaks about contactees (and
     abductees - Branton), told us at a workshop one night about these
     silver bebes. Apparently they are/were a communication/ tracking
     device. The ball was not given to me. The hospital kept it. Dr.
     Mundy told us that during this time period, the 1950's, the
     government informed all doctors and hospitals to be on the alert
     for these bebes."

During the 'contactee' era of the late 1950's and early '60's a man by the
name of Mel Noel made the rounds of the UFO circuit describing his
experiences as an Air Force 'line pilot' whose top secret mission involved
the photographing of UFO's (both visible and 'cloaked' craft -- radar
directing and infrared film being used for the latter). These encounters
usually took place over the Rocky mountains of Utah and Idaho, according to
Noel, and throughout the years 1953-54. One of Noel's lectures was
delivered during that period to a huge crowd at the Giant Rock UFO
Convention held in the Mojave desert near Twenty Nine Palms, California.

For several years 'Mel Noel' was out of the news, until in the early 1990's
that is, when he reappeared stating that 'Noel' was merely a pseudonym, and
implying that because of greater present-day awareness of the UFO phenomena
he could more easily use his real name of 'Guy Kirkwood'. Kirkwood later
appeared on the premier 'UFO CONTACT' episode of the Fox Networks
'SIGHTINGS' series, in the early 1990's. Kirkwood described an almost
identical account as was given by 'Noel'.

Kirkwood's (or 'Noel's') commanding officer during the operation had
allegedly established radio contact with the human occupants of alien
craft, who were rather attractive in appearance and could even pass
themselves off as Americans if they were to walk the streets of any large
city. His Commanding Officer later claimed that he had physical contacts
with these craft. These human-like aliens claimed during a 'radio
conversation' (between themselves and the Commanding Officer -- a
conversation which Noel and his three co-pilots were allowed to listen in
on) that 'they' were from underground cities beneath other planetary bodies
in the Sol System, AS WELL AS from underground cities within the earth
itself. They claimed that these colonies or societies were affiliated
together through a Central 'Tribunal' on or below the moons of Saturn.

In Kirkwood's own words, in reference to this communication:

     "...they referred to, they made the statement that our scientists
     had made statements based upon theories that LIFE CANNOT AND
     THEREFORE DOES NOT EXIST ON THE OTHER PLANETS IN THIS SYSTEM, AND
     THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE CONFIRMING THOSE STATEMENTS. HE SAID,
     'LIFE DOES NOT AND CANNOT EXIST ON THESE OTHER PLANETS; IT'S ALL
     INSIDE THE PLANETS, IT'S ALL IN THE INTERIOR, JUST AS THE HOUSE
     OF THE LORD. THIS IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WE LIVE IN, THE
     INTERIOR OF THE PLANET..."

     Kirkwood also stated: "...They went into a number of other things
     that may or may not be important; by discussion with legal
     advice, much of this, I CAN ONLY DISCUSS ABOUT 10 PER CENT OF
     WHAT TOOK PLACE."

This last statement probably had something to do with his security
clearance. However, one of the most interesting things about the case was
that almost a month after Kirkwood's Commanding Officer informed him and
his friends that 'he' was being allowed to join the aliens' society, his
plane disappeared off the eastern coast without a trace. Kirkwood/Noel is
convinced that 'they' took him. At one point during the 'Contactee' period
'Noel' even claimed that he could arrange 'for rides' on UFO's, suggestive
that he might have had later physical encounters with these space beings.
Researcher John Keel once had dinner with 'Noel' in a restaurant in New
York City, and Keel noticed that 'Noel' did hang around people and
especially women who were very 'exotic' looking, and Keel was convinced
that their conversation was being monitored, possibly by CIA types.

In the mid-1980's a Canadian woman by the name of Joan Howard wrote a
privately published book, titled "THE SPACE - OR SOMETHING - CONNECTION".
We refer to it here because it dealt with some experiences which she, or
rather her husband, had shortly after she came to America from Britain. In
fact Joan devoted an entire chapter to her husbands account, which involved
some incidents that took place while he was doing some field work for a
certain company, which required a great deal of activity in the
out-of-doors. During his employment with this company, 'they' (he and his
co-workers) had to travel through some relatively unpopulated terrain in
West Virginia, particularly in the regions between Newville in Braxton
county, and Helvetia in Randolph county, or rather the general region in
and around the northern part of Webster county.

During their travels through the forests and wilderness, and the rolling
hills-mountains of West Virginia, he had encountered some very strange
things, and heard accounts of strange cavern- related experiences from the
locals. At one point, he claimed, their group ran across what appeared to
be a pipe sticking up from the ground far from the nearest town. There was
no other sign of civilization or anything manmade for miles in either
direction, yet here was this large pipe or tube sticking straight up from
the ground. But the most remarkable thing was that a flame was shooting out
of the pipe as if it were burning some type of gas. They never found out
just what it was. Also, in this same general area, they explored caverns
which contained some very strange things. One of the caverns had strange
hieroglyphic-like writing on it's walls, and others claimed that they heard
what sounded like faint voices, and also machine-like sounds moving
underground, as if they were emanating from beyond the walls of the
caverns, or from their unexplored depths. Two men, he claimed, bedded down
one night in front of a certain cave which contained a very deep,
unexplored chasm some ways inside. The next morning one of the men woke up
and found that his partner had disappeared, and no trace was ever found of
him. This particular cave by the way had been known as a place of unusual
happenings, and a place to stay away from. Some even went so far as to call
it 'Satan's Lair'. Whatever the case may be, it may provide an answer to
the man's disappearance. One of the most remarkable accounts that Joan's
husband heard involved a man who claimed that, while exploring the
labyrinthine depths of a particular cavern in the area, he had suddenly
come face to face with a woman. She was attractive yet completely devoid of
hair (such as someone who might have been subjected to radiation
poisoning?). The woman, who spoke a language completely foreign to the man,
tried for some time to communicate. After they found that they were not
getting anywhere, they departed and went their separate ways.

Joan Howard also claims to have had contacts with dwarfish beings since she
was a small child, although her experiences make it unclear whether these
'occupants' were human or not. She does state however that 'poltergeist'
type manifestations often accompanied her UFO experiences, suggesting that
the occupants -- whether humanoid or saurioid, were involved with the
darker side. She did warn potential researchers to be suspicious of ANY
alien group which might attempt to contact them; encouraged them to PROVE
if their claims are true; and always to keep "...a cold, keen, analytical
mind."

Stan Deyo was one of many Air Force cadets during the 1960's who dreamed of
serving his country as an Air Force pilot. That was until Deyo learned that
something strange was going on in the Air Force Academy where he was
stationed. The anonymous Intelligence Community insider, 'Commander X',
relates:

     "...Because of what he discovered while an unwilling 'guinea pig'
     in certain experiments that were secretly being conducted by a
     covert organization working within the military, Stan Deyo had to
     flee the United States for a new home half way around the world.
     Running as far as he could, the bearded scientist ended up in
     Perth, Australia, where he surfaced to tell his incredible saga
     of a conspiracy so sinister that it doesn't seem possible that
     something like this could actually transpire in the birthplace of
     George Washington, Abe Lincoln or John F. Kennedy.

     "Deyo had enlisted into the United States Air Force and was sent
     for special training to the highly prestigious Air Force Academy
     located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

     "'...We were the elite from all over America, especially selected
     for a secret purpose we knew nothing about,' he told PEOPLE
     MAGAZINE, an Australia weekly news magazine not to be confused
     with the celebrity profile magazine of the same name published in
     the U.S.

     "'They got control of our minds when we were asleep and fed us
     the most advanced physics for months on end. Then some of us
     began to realize something was happening to our minds and we
     rebelled.

     "'After two years, they failed the entire class -- 180 of us. We
     knew too much. I'm speaking out now because I believe the world
     should know what they are up to, as well as for my own
     protection.'

     "As Deyo explains it, the Sixties were a turbulent period even as
     far as the U.S. government was concerned. For some unexplainable
     reason, Stan Deyo found himself along with his classmates in the
     middle of an 'intelligence war' between the FBI and the CIA, with
     the CIA bound and determined to keep the lid on a brand new form
     of technology directly related to UFOs.

     "The CIA in conjunction with military-industrial 'big business'
     has for a period of several years been in collusion, Deyo
     alleges, on findings that center around the development of a type
     of disk or saucer-shaped, antigravity machine that originated out
     of 'alien' technology. According to Deyo's scenario, the U.S. is
     worried that sooner or later they will run out of conventional
     fuel sources and that the 'elite' and powerful will need a
     revolutionary technology in order to survive (and no doubt
     maintain their control over the populations of the earth). So
     they contacted General Electric, Sperry Rand and Bell Aircraft to
     spearhead a drive to develop this new technology, which can whirl
     a disc-like craft through inter-planetary space at thousands of
     miles a second using the minds of the craft's crew members to
     navigate the Earth-made UFOs. This is where Deyo's training was
     supposedly to come in handy. Because of his intelligence level,
     he was to be made one of the ship's pilots as soon as his mental
     capabilities had been 'stretched' through hypnosis and an
     advanced form of electronic 'mind control'.

'Commander X' continues:

     "...One of the most astounding things Deyo said -- and this was
     almost ten years ago (i.e. around the late 1970's and early '80's
     - Branton) -- was that he felt one of the staunchest supporters
     of this radically new anti-gravity technology was none other than
     the late William P. Lear -- John Lear's father!

     "At the time, Lear Sr. was quoted by the Associated Press as
     having said: 'I can't help but feel flying saucers are real,
     because of numerous manifestations over long periods of time with
     many simultaneous observations by reliable observers.' -- And
     this is the clincher: 'THERE ARE NOW SERIOUS EFFORTS IN PROGRESS
     TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANTI-GRAVITATIONAL FORCES AND TO
     CONVERT ATOMIC ENERGY DIRECTLY TO ELECTRICITY...'

     Commander X continues: "For those who hold suspicions that John
     Lear might -- at least sometimes -- be responsible for dealing
     from the 'bottom of the deck' -- providing as much in the way of
     'disinformation' as valid 'information' -- we can't help but
     theorize about the significance of the above quote attributed to
     his father, and the possibility that some of what John Lear is
     telling us is meant to steer our attention toward 'aliens',
     rather than look right under our very noses at an Earthly
     technology that may be advanced beyond what we are currently
     taught is achievable through modern day science.

     "We wonder if perhaps there isn't to be found substantiation
     behind the rumor that Lear Aircraft Company (a firm that John's
