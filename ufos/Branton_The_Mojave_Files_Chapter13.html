"He indicated that the objects fly in a wobbly way. His pictures have shown
that. He says 'like the rocking of a boat.' He has measured many right
angle turns and also full 180 degree turns in a 20th of a second with the
objects still inside the bow-wave. He has also observed and photographed
the object or lights moving in a triangular pattern and square patterns. HE
SAYS HIGH POWERED RADAR CAN INTERFERE WITH THEM (Radar operates through the
generation of powerful electromagnetic beams, so it is reasonable to assume
that if a radar array is large enough and its energy output focused enough,
a radar 'beam' might conceivably throw an aerial craft operating on
electro- magnetic anti-gravitational principles out of balance, causing a
crash. In fact it is said by William Cooper and others that several of the
disks that crashed in the late 1940's were intentionally brought down by
the military using powerful radar systems - Branton). I reported on the
meeting that we had on Sunday afternoon and raised some of the questions
that came out of that meeting. One of them was why not remove the implant?
He said that this had been discussed and the lady witness finds that
acceptable if she can be assured that there can be no nerve damage. He then
went into great detail, which exceeds my knowledge of anatomy, in
describing the location of the implants. ONE APPEARS TO BE ADJACENT TO AND
EXTERNAL TO THE CORTEX, WHICH I THINK HE INDICATED WAS AT THE BASE OF THE
BRAIN. The image of the CATscan is of a very small helix, like it was
joining two major nerves near the spinal column. Then on the lateral right
side from the back, there is an implant of perhaps like the one above.
Another is on the left side. Two others are on the forward part of the
skull, which appear to be small 2 millimeter electrodes AGAINST THE RADIAL
NERVE. There is a shape to these things which he indicated is like a baby
bottle nipple upside down (* This shape is not the implants which
[-unreadable-] the skull), not the cap part, but just the nipple itself. (I
raised the question of the U.S.S.R. satellites seeing this Base) He
acknowledged that and also that ours can certainly see it. (This would be
confirmed by the famous GROOM LAKE satellite photograph, showing the dry
lake bed in the S-4/Dreamland area of Nevada which has made the rounds
within the UFO research community, a photograph that was taken by a Russian
satellite - Branton) He had a discussion with some photo analyst (* OSI
photo analyst) who indicated that he had seen tracks up a hill and a launch
location that was definitely not a rock but some kind of artificial
construction. On the hazard of entering (the) area, I asked about that. He
said that there is a risk if we went in on foot, but if a person tried to
do that (it was) likely that the people would 'wack them.' (* I said 'zap'.
The odds are one might be accosted) But he thinks that a helicopter would
be safe. But what he wants to do is to do additional aerial surveillance.
Then go in with a group, the larger number of people the better. A Highway
Patrol- man, a friend of his, is ready to go in at any time. He says one
can't act on impulse. You have to plan out a program. He said four times he
had near encounters and one was with this Major Edwards. He had received a
mental communication (* No -- not received -- I asked them mentally -- they
were apparently scanning me -- I don't 'receive' anything mentally.) while
watching some UFOs...

"He is president of Thunder Scientific Corporation, a well known operation
there, with their specialty being temperature and humidity devices. THEIR
EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ON THE SHUTTLE AND MOST OF THEIR BUSINESS IS WITH THE
TOP 500 CORPORATIONS.

"His company is by Sandia on 1/2 acres and (he is) now building an
additional 3500 sq. ft. building. There is another organization called
Bennewitz Laboratory which is the research arm of Thunder Scientific
Corporation owned 90% by the latter and operated by his three sons. They
have invented a hearing device that has no moving parts that makes totally
deaf people able to hear and in addition, expanding the frequency range
plus 100 HZ on the high side and down to less than 10 HZ on the low
frequency end.

"He said that he got involved in all this merely as a hobby and it became
an obsession. He simply wanted to know what was going on and to develop
instrumentation to measure data, etc. Since THE SIGNALS FROM THE UFOS ARE
VERY LOW FREQUENCY, DOWN AROUND 200 HZ and with an analyzer you just think
you are looking at some noise. But I believe he said IT WAS A MEMORY SCOPE
THAT WAS ABLE TO FILTER OUT THE SIGNAL INVOLVED THERE WHEREAS ORDINARY
FILTERS DO NOT. They trigger signals in an on and off fashion, instead of O
and 1 volt representing that type of communication or signal a distinction
is made between a narrow pulse and wide pulse. Each communication is
preceded by four or five pulses. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE
O.S.I. which has been verified by (the book) 'CLEAR INTENT.' But NOW HE
SAYS THAT WHEN HE CALLS THEM, THEY WON'T SPEAK TO HIM SO HE IS IN A 'SHUT
OUT' SITUATION. I pointed out that there were two O.S.I.'s (Office of
Special Investigation) and the other is C.I.A. (Office of Scientific
Investigation). He assured me that it was not the C.I.A. group. He said the
actual title of the group that he was dealing with was the 'Office of
Secret Investigation' (or 'Intelligence'). He says there is also a new
pattern or [-?-] called Human Intelligence, that is they investigate the
humans, that is the government. I mentioned to him that in 'CLEAR INTENT'
that it said he was under surveillance. That happens to be in error. That
information comes from SOMEWHERE ELSE. But he quickly said 'I know that I
am under surveillance.' They set up a site across the street from his house
with computers and recorders. A girl rented the house. He had a detective
look into this and found that she was operating under an assumed name and
SHE HAD NO SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. HE HAS PHOTO- GRAPHS OF PEOPLE COMING
AND GOING WITH 'NORAD' LICENSE PLATES, AIR FORCE, A.F. WEAPONS LAB. HE
THINKS N.S.A. IS ORCHESTRATING THIS. For an entirely separate subject, he
thinks (* I was told that it was by a Washing- ton source) this whole
operation, THE UFO BASE DETAIL IS CLASSIFIED HIGHER THAN THE PRESIDENT.
THAT IS, HE THINKS THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS (Not in total
depth) (* True).

"He is also concerned that there are two levels of security involved. (1)
Project AQUARIUS which is TOP SECRET and another (2) higher than that;
where people in charge of the higher level information HAVING THESE NEW
VEHICLES COULD SIMPLY TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT. He called the Air Force
intelligence head headquarters in (Washington) (* Yes -- true -- AF Intel.)
(He didn't say Washington, but that was the idea) The Commanding Officer
was not present but he talked to a Captain who was the adjutant or
executive and started talking. He said 'I know all of these facts, and this
and that and what do you think about that?' The Captain said 'JUST WRITE US
A REPORT AND TELL US WHAT WE SHOULD DO.' (* About it) So he prepared a 20
page report and Edwards saw it. He for- warded it by Federal Express and
also a copy to the White House in a double envelope, indicating that
sensitive material was in the inner envelope. Edwards got a call from
Colonel Smith (* Not Smith -- Col. Don ____? Have to check files.) who was
the White House Liaison to inquire who this Bennewitz fellow was. Edwards
gave a positive report. The White House was extremely interested and issued
orders 'TO GET ON WITH IT; TO DO SOMETHING, ASSURING EDWARDS THAT BENNEWITZ
WOULD RECEIVE A LETTER WITHIN TWO WEEKS.' (Note: This serves to confirm
that TWO groups, elected and unelected, are working simultan- eous in
'government' and that each seems to have two different agendas - Branton)
Such a letter was never received. Finally, Col. Smith from the Air Force
Secretary sent him a letter eventually just pursuing the 'old party line.'
That said 'he should not be troubling the headquarters of the Air Force and
the Executive offices of the White House with all of his stuff.'

"Bennewitz showed this letter to Edwards WHO BLEW UP AND CALLED SMITH (*
Col Don. ____). They got an answer from the Air Force that they were not
interested and knew nothing about it. On another point: referencing the
'STIGMATA' article where the farmer thought that the two humanoids may have
been naked. In the case with which he was dealing with -- the woman and the
son, the boy upon being questioned laughed, and said 'they had no fronts or
behinds.' I asked no sexual organs, and he said yes, no organs at all. He
has received information concerning a high metabolism rate of the
creatures, even birdlike. One of the wit- nesses, I think the woman who was
being taken by the hand, said the hand of the creatures was 'red hot.' And
he guesses that it must have been 115 degrees F. The creatures cannot stand
uncontrolled environment. THEY WEAR SUITS FOR PROTECT- ION AGAINST
EXCESSIVE HEAT. They are fed by a formula and if they are short of that
intake, they will turn green. (* Turn Grey -- They are a light yellow green
when healthy) The heart is on the right side and they have one lung.
Elimination is through the skin. The creatures are very strong...

"He says that the UFOs can be detected by radar detectors and they also
trigger highway patrol radar or Police radar guns. His friend Valdez, at
his suggestion, was looking for water intake to the site and within about 1
1/2 miles he came upon a flying saucer at a distance of about 300 ft. THE
INDIANS OWN THE AREA -- ARE QUITE SCARED AND VERY SUPERSTITIOUS AND 90% OF
THEM HAVE MOVED INTO TOWN. The Chief of Police told him about an experience
he had. A tribal chief had gone deer hunting on a mesa SOUTH of Dulce. Two
days went by. When he didn't return, a search party was sent out. In the
day- light on the mesa, a ship 'hopped up' from down below and came above
the mesa. The guys (human) kicked the tribal chief to the ground. Then they
got into the ship and disappeared. He had been hunting and had 'fell'. He
had a broken leg and he was picked up by these people in the craft. They
were blacks... (* No -- No --the SHIP was black... black uniforms) He
discussed something about some devices called sphericals that are optical
in sound (* They have a sound when they move abruptly.) and apparently
remotely controlled little vehicles... Spheres from 1 1/2" to 12" in
diameter. We discussed weapons used by aliens and whether or not they are
used to paralyze people. Yes, they consist of a cube about 2" on a side --
called a lens, hung around the neck -- that emits a beam. Another on the
ship produces a BLUE LIGHT that he has seen. It comes from a device about
4" high and 14" long with grid black lines on it. The color produced is
very light blue which is like ionized oxygen. He has not sought publicity
on any of this. He is only interested in getting the facts...

"I continue to get reassurance that the guy is continually on the level and
what he has to say should be taken seriously... (Jim McCampbell comment.)"

Following are quotations from a document which was put together by Paul
Bennewitz. Although Paul has apparently been 'silenced', the discoveries he
has made in the physical/techno- logical area of this 'para-physical' war
cannot be covered up. The following is apparently a proposed plan for a
physical assault against the aliens and may be useful in any future
attempts to re- take the bases from alien or ALIEN-CONTROLLED elements (and
possibly set free the various 'captives' being held there):

"IN BRIEF -- THESE ARE APPARENT CAPABILITIES OBSERVED AND GLEANED THROUGH
THE COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND OBSERVATION. YOU MAY KNOW THESE, HOWEVER,
THEY ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LAST AND FINAL PORTION OF THIS REPORT.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

"1) Because of the alien's apparent logic system (they appear to be logic
controlled) A KEY DECISION CANNOT BE MADE WITHOUT HIGHER CLEARANCE. ALL ARE
UNDER THE CONTROL OF WHAT THEY CALL 'THE KEEPER'; YET IT WOULD APPEAR THIS
IS NOT THE FINAL SAY. THEREFORE, DEPENDENT UPON URGENCY, DELAYS OF AS LONG
AS TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HOURS CAN OCCUR FOR A DECISION. HOW SHORT/LONG THIS
TIME FRAME UNDER BATTLE CONDITIONS MAY BE, I DO NOT KNOW.

"Because of this apparent control, INDIVIDUAL INSTANT- ANEOUS DECISION
MAKING BY THE ALIEN IS LIMITED. IF THE 'PLAN' GOES EVEN SLIGHTLY OUT OF
BALANCE OR CONTEXT, THEY BECOME CONFUSED. Faced with this, possibly, the
humanoids would be the first to break and run.

"The same applies to their Mission MASTER PLAN, if one can call it that. IF
PUSHED OUT OF CONTEXT, IT WILL COME APART -- THEY WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE
WORLD SO THEY WILL POSSIBLY RUN BEFORE THEY FIGHT IN THE OPEN. THEY
DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

"Psychologically, at present, their morale is down -- near disintegration.
There is pronounced dissension in the ranks; even with the humanoids.
Communication can encourage this (not necessity to expound upon this other
than to say BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INTERNAL VULNERABILITY MIND-WISE TO EACH
OTHER, THEREIN LIES A PRIME WEAKNESS). Inter-echelon or individual 'trust'
appears to be totally lacking so suspicion of each other is rampant. They
are highly segregated as to levels -- a 'low' dare not conflict with a
'medium' or 'high' or it literally means death. Death being, to the
humanoid, deprogramming or, in the end perhaps total physical death.

"THEY APPEAR TO BE TOTALLY DEATH ORIENTED and because of this, absolutely
death-fear oriented. THIS IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE. The computer also
gives indications of a real possibility of adverse or 'ground programming'.

"2) Consider their ships -- most if not all run on charge. The source
depletes and so dependent upon size, depletion can occur from some within a
week or less. Ships can replenish each other but only up to charge balance.
This is done with antennae- like extensions and the charge is distributed
observing conservation of energy laws. THEY CAN REPLENISH FROM POWER LINES
-- BUT AGAIN ONLY TO A POINT -- so time of flight is limited. Deprived of
their base recharge capability, it is indicated that all ships will come
down within six months to a year unless they can get transported out --
that is back to the prime launch ship.

"The disks and saucers in general cannot fly in space because of their mode
of flight (i.e. unless they are within an interplanetary or interstellar
carrier' vessel - Branton). Therefore, deprived of home base, it is not
likely they can survive. THEIR CAPABILITY IN POWER SURVIVAL OUTLASTS THEIR
CAPABILITY IN FOOD OR FORMULA SURVIVAL. IF THEY DO NOT GET THE FORMULA/FOOD
WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME THEY WILL WEAKEN AND DIE.

"IN THE CASE OF MT. ARCHULETA AND SOUTH PEAK, THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE
NAVAJO RIVER FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WATER TO THEM IS TOTALLY LIFE. WITHOUT
WATER THEY HAVE NO POWER; WITHOUT POWER, NO OXYGEN OR HYDROGEN TO SERVICE
THE SHIPS AND WEAPONS. NO WATER TO SUSTAIN THE ORGANS AND FEEDING FORMULA
(Note: We should also take into account the possibility of subterranean
water sources. Also, if the base can be weakened by shutting off the
supply-line of water, the 'formula', and so-on it might be wise -- for the
sake of human 'prisoners' below -- to not wait until the base is too weak
as this might endanger these humans. We suggest that in addition to the
strategies Bennewitz gives in this document, an all-out under-"ground"
invasion force should also be considered, prepared to enter the base when
it is at a specific 'weak' point, still considering the human captives -
Branton).

"Simple? Not really. However, THERE IS A WATER INTAKE AND THERE IS A DAM
UPSTREAM THAT CAN BE TOTALLY CUT OFF AND THE WATER RE-ROUTED TO CHAMA, NEW
MEXICO. SHOULD THIS OCCUR, AT LEAST THREE OF THE INTERNAL BASES WILL GO
DOWN. They could possibly go atomic periodically but obviously problems
without cooling.

"Once the bases are pressed on a large scale, all disks and saucers will go
airborne immediately. TROOPS ON THE GROUND CAN GAIN TERRAIN COVER TO QUITE
A DEGREE -- IT IS ROUGH TERRAIN.

"3) OUR NEED IS FOR A WEAPON, workable and preferably NOT like the alien's.
I believe unless the alien is caught unawares (with their screen up their
weapons are equal so they are like children pillow boxing) there can be no
result; THE WEAPON MUST PENETRATE THEIR SCREEN AND IT MUST ALSO PENETRATE
THE GROUND. I BELIEVE I HAVE THAT WEAPON (Note: Was this suggestion of
Bennewitz', for a ground 'penetrating' device, the original inspiration for
the Los Alamos 'Excalibur' weapon? -- a nuclear device which was designed
to bore through the earth and destroy 'aliens' in their underground bases?
- Branton). Two small prototypes have been funded and constructed by my
Company. Tests conducted to date indicate they do work and work rather well
considering their small size. Because of this weapon's present status and
proprietary nature (a basic patent is in process), the theory will not be
explained here. However, the weapon appears to do two things at very low
power. 1) The disks within it's range begin to discharge when exposed to
the weapon beam. To counteract, they must apply more power and so doing
consume power. Again conservation of energy laws strictly apply.

"This effect can be observed on the detection instruments as they back away
in response to slow discharge. DISCHARGE, AT LOW POWER IS SLOW BUT AT HIGH
POWER IN THE FINAL SOPHISTICATED WEAPON, THE RATE CAN BE INCREASED BY MANY
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. 2) MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS WEAPON CAN PENETRATE THE
SCREEN -- HULL ALLOY, EVERYTHING. They cannot shield it in any way. Lastly,
BECAUSE OF THE IMPLANTS, THE WEAPON'S BEAM GETS TO THEM MENTALLY; THEY LOSE
JUDGMENT AND INDICATE ALMOST IMMEDIATE CON- FUSION, PARTICULARLY THE
HUMANOIDS.

"It is believed at this early stage -- based upon present testing, that the
weapon when full on and full size will kill and bring down disks at
substantial range. The alien weapons operate substan- tially the same as
their disks using a charge source and charge distribution. So, in the same
sense it is indicated that this weapon design will pull their charge
weapons down very rapidly.

"The range of my weapon exceeds that of their present weapons and in its
most sophisticated form can be readily computer controlled to allow
extremely rapid tracking and lock-on regardless of speed along with
electronic wobbulation of the beam. IT IS A BEAM WEAPON and even at this
early stage of miniature prototype testing and development, it indicates
EVENTUAL superiority to their weapons.

"4) Initial logistics would indicate a plan sequentially implemented as
follows: This plan DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATORY SAFETY
MEASURES TO BE EMPLOYED BY GROUND FORCES; HOWEVER, IF AIR FORCE
INTELLIGENCE DESIRES TO PURSUE THE APPROACHES SUGGESTED IN THIS REPORT,
EACH SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN DEPTH.

"AN ATTACK MUST BE DIRECTED NEAR ENTIRETY ON THE GROUND FOR OBVIOUS
REASONS. One would, if familiar with the alien capability, indicate that
vehicle ignition problems will be encountered. This is precisely true;
however, the reason for this is not mysterious but is based upon good solid
laws of physics and are known. (From) experience gained through my study,
it is now known how to prevent this from happening and will be discussed in
detail at some later date. All electrical and electronic equipment must be
'hardened' using these specific techniques prior to implementation. Because
of the known capability of the alien (by use of scanning beams to know in
advance details of planning) only the initial outline is presented in this
report.

"Again through the communicative interaction (computer-linked
'interrogation'? - Branton) with the alien, testing has simultaneously been
done upon this facet, i.e. eavesdropping and ways to abort this capability
have been tested and proven.

"The program would be instigated in phases. The first phase -- planning and
logistics -- would include continued implementation and testing of the
final weapon prototype through the pre-production stage. Production of at
least fifty minimum quality should be planned. Additional backup spares
should also be included.

"On a full time shift basis, it is estimated that at least one year or less
would be required to arrive at the pre-production stage. A team would be
organized by THUNDER SCIENTIFIC to accomplish this. The key work is now and
would be done by an associated company, BENNEWITZ LABS., LTD.

"Specific attack phases would be incorporated:

"1) The first procedure would be TO CLOSE THE GATES OF THE DAM ABOVE THE
NAVAJO RIVER. THIS DAM WOULD BE HELD CLOSED FOR THE DURATION. INTERNAL TO
THE ONE CAVE, THERE IS A SMALL DAM FOR WATER STORAGE. It's capacity is
small. THERE IS ALSO A DISCHARGE OUTLET DOWNSTREAM THAT COULD BE CLOSED
CAUSING WASTE WATER TO BACK-UP INTO THE CAVES. THE WATER IS VACUUM PUMPED
APPARENTLY BY SOME ELECTROSTATIC MEANS FROM THE RIVER. At close range, the
weapon will take out this capability.

"2) Once deprived TOTALLY of water for a minimum period of four weeks,
conditions in the alien bases under discussion will have badly
deteriorated. PSYCHOLOGICAL SHOCK IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE WITH THE ALIEN;
total advantage can be taken by instantaneous action or planned observable
deviation from the norm. AT LEAST THREE BASES WILL GO DOWN.

"3) If they follow their normal strategic pattern as when pressed
previously, they will launch most if not all ships.

"4) Prior to the implementation of water deprivation, the weapons should be
deployed at strategic hardened locations and activated in a certain
pre-planned manner determined by final weapon coordinate locations.

"5) This will put an immediate power drain upon those airborne and the
alien weapons ringing their bases.

"6) Because of the inherent psychological aspect of the alien (does
Bennewitz refer to the Grays in the singular, in that the aliens operate in
one 'collective conscious'? - Branton), much can be done in the open with
no attempt to preserve secrecy. Much of what is done can be of a
diversionary nature. UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO HARASS
BUT WILL NOT OPENLY ATTACK (They are more into "Mind" warfare than Material
warfare, although they have used physical weaponry when pushed into a
corner -- as in airborne assaults against their craft or ground assaults
against their bases. Apparently they would prefer to take control of a
world without the trouble of risking the loss of machinery and personnel -
Branton)

"7) Throughout and prior to this, the open computer communica- tions link
will be operational for continued PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERROGATION.

"8) At some point in time -- again resting upon battle status, THE
DEPLOYMENT OF OFFENSIVE FORCES WILL BEGIN. This deployment should be done
in a near instantaneous manner under certain special conditions that can be
discussed.

"9) The weapon system should be kept powered up throughout. In this manner,
the disks will be made to stay airborne. They cannot land in the interval
the system is powered.

"10) When the weapon is used in one specific power mode, in addition to
continuous discharge on the disks that are airborne and the ground based
weapons, THE MIND CONFUSION AND DIS- ORIENTATION WILL BUILD IN THOSE
PERSONNEL AT THE BASE AND UNDERGROUND. At the end of four to five weeks or
less, all weapons should be totally discharged and power out on the bases.
Most personnel if not all, will be totally incapacitated. THE FEEDING
FORMULA WILL BE DOWN AND IT'S CRITICAL PROCESSING RUINED. ALL (alien)
EMBRYOS SHOULD BE DEAD AND ALL HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN CONSUMABLES DEPLETED.
(Note: This is of course speaking in 'conventional' warfare terms, however
one must balance this by taking into account the spiritual-supernatural
aspects of the conflict as well, being that this is a psycho-spiritual as
well as a conventional conflict. Also, if the extent of the base is much
deeper and wide- spread then previously believed -- via interconnected
caverns and shuttle terminals -- then these facts should be brought into
the scenario as well. For instance the 'aliens' might escape through the
'tubes' to other installations. Even if this occurs this major base can be
conquered fully by human [Evadamic] forces, from whom the 'draconians'
apparently took 'control' of it in times past. For instance, Hopi-Apache
activist Robert Morningsky says that his people were driven FROM the caves
centuries ago by the invading "children of the reptile" - Branton)

"11) Based upon data gathered on the miniature prototype weapons, the full
power weapons should have no problem holding off the disks. In many cases
some will break within the first forty- eight hours without being directly
hit.

"12) At that point, standard weapon technology and logistics can come into
play and (be) used to the extent of destruction desired at the direction of
those in charge.

"13) The communications can be used throughout to determine status and near
the end to attempt to instigate surrender. If no response results, then
they should simply be closed in and waited out.

"SUMMARY -- It is important to note that the initial implement- ation of
the computer communications WAS NOT INSTIGATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF TALKING
TO THE ALIEN FOR THE 'FUN OF IT'; BUT WAS DELIBERATELY INSTIGATED TO USE AS
A TOOL TO STUDY, IN DEPTH -- LONG TERM WITHOUT PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION --
THE STRENGTHS AND WEAK- NESSES OF THE ALIEN.

"The weapon theory and prototypes were built to capitalize upon and test
two KEY and prominent weaknesses discovered. This in-house funded program
has been expensive, in excess of $200,000; done ON BEHALF OF OUR NATION and
handled in the best representative manner humanly possible.

"1) The PRIME and weakest area discovered, probed and tested is exactly
what they have used thinking it is their key strength - that being, THE
MANIPULATION OF AND CONTROL OF THE MIND; NOT ONLY OF COMMAND BUT ALSO
HUMAN- OID. MANIPULATED IN REVERSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND BY THE LANGUAGE
(COMPUTER) AND DUE TO THE EXTREME OF MENTAL DISTORTION AND INCAPACITY
CAUSED BY THE WEAPON, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THIS FACET IS FOR THEM A
DISASTER AND A DIRECTLY VULNERABLE INTE- GRATED WEAKNESS.

"2) Though their ships are magnificent, they are also weak - solely BECAUSE
of their method and unique mode of flight. They do not have a stable
fighting platform (Note: The effectiveness of stable-flying conventional
jet craft ARMED with high-tech beam weaponry has been confirmed by the
'South African Incident' described elsewhere -- if in fact that event was a
true account. However we MUST realize that there are 'human' as well as
'alien- sauroid' occupied UFO-type craft in the atmosphere, and the PROBLEM
would be our ability to determine whether these craft are friends or foes!
- Branton). Charge distribution CAN also be discharged. The weapon does
this - even in it's present miniature prototype state.

"IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT TO IMPLY THAT THE OVERALL PROBLEM
WILL BE SOLVED WITH THE CAPTURE OF THESE BASES. Obviously IT WILL NOT, but
it is a firmly based beginning with a high degree of rated projected
success ratio. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY THE ALIEN WILL NOT FIGHT; THEY
MAY - THOUGH THEIR INCLINATION IS GENERALLY THE OPPOSITE - THIS BASING AREA
IS KEY! WITHOUT IT, THEIR MISSION IS IN VERY DEEP (TROUBLE)..."

(Note: The copy of the document on which the above quotations were based
was missing the first 8 and last 2 pages).

Relative to the above, LEADING EDGE RESEARCH released the following
synopsis of 'THE DULCE PAPERS':

"The Dulce papers were comprised of 25 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS, A VIDEO TAPE
WITH NO DIALOGUE and a set of papers that included technical information of
the allegedly jointly occupied (U.S.-Alien) facility 1 kilometer beneath
the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. SEVERAL PERSONS WERE GIVEN THE
ABOVE PACKAGE FOR SAFE KEEPING. Most of those given the package were shown
what the package contained but were not technically oriented and knew very
little about what they were looking at. The following is written by ONE OF
THESE PERSONS about what the papers contained. This person described the
scenes that the video tape showed... What you see is what you get; I can't
decipher what is written or drawn anymore than you can. I pass these papers
on only in the interest of getting to the truth. (From) other information I
have, I believe the infor- mation herein is true. I believe the facility
exists and is CURRENT- LY OPERATIONAL. I also believe that there are 4
ADDITIONAL FACILITIES OF THE SAME TYPE, ONE LOCATED A FEW MILES TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF GROOM LAKE, NEVADA. What is the truth? Only God, MJ-12 and the
aliens know for sure.

"Dulce papers: Lots of papers-documents that discuss COPPER AND MOLYBDENUM,
also papers about MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM, BUT MOSTLY ABOUT COPPER. Lots of
'MEDICAL TERMS' that I don't understand. A sheet of paper with charts and
strange diagrams. Papers that discuss ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT AND GAMMA RAYS.
Papers that discuss COLOR AND BLACK AND WHITE AND HOW TO AVOID DETECTION
THROUGH USE OF CERTAIN COLORS. In addition to these papers THERE ARE ABOUT
25 PICTURES, BLACK AND WHITE, PLUS ONE VIDEO TAPE WITH NO DIALOGUE, ALL
TAKEN INSIDE THE DULCE FACILITY. THESE PAPERS TELL WHAT THE ALIENS ARE
AFTER AND HOW THE BLOOD (TAKEN FROM THE COWS) IS USED. Aliens (i.e.
REPTILIANS or SAUROIDS - Branton) seem to absorb atoms to 'eat'. ALIENS PUT
HANDS 'IN BLOOD', SORT OF LIKE A SPONGE, FOR NOURISHMENT. IT'S NOT JUST
FOOD THEY WANT, THE DNA in cattle and humans is being altered. THE 'TYPE
ONE' CREATURE IS A LAB ANIMAL. 'THEY' (again, the SAURIOIDS - Branton) KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE THE ATOMS TO CREATE A TEMPORARY 'ALMOST HUMAN BEING'
(MIB-like? - Branton). IT IS MADE WITH ANIMAL TISSUE AND DEPENDS ON A
COMPU- TER TO SIMULATE MEMORY, A MEMORY THE COMPUTER HAS WITHDRAWN FROM
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. THE 'ALMOST HUMAN BEING' IS SLIGHTLY SLOW AND CLUMSY.
REAL HUMANS ARE USED FOR TRAINING, TO EXPERIMENT AND BREED WITH THESE
'ALMOST HUMANS'. SOME HUMANS ARE KIDNAPPED AND USED COMPLETELY (EVEN
ATOMS). SOME ARE KEPT IN LARGE TUBES, AND ARE KEPT ALIVE IN AN AMBER
LIQUID. SOME HUMANS ARE BRAIN- WASHED AND USED TO DISTORT THE TRUTH.
CERTAIN MALE HUMANS HAVE A HIGH SPERM COUNT AND ARE KEPT ALIVE. THEIR SPERM
IS USED TO ALTER THE DNA AND CREATE A NON-GENDER BEING CALLED 'TYPE TWO'.
That sperm is grown some way and altered again, put in large wombs, many
destroyed, certain are altered again and then put in separate wombs. THEY
RESEMBLE 'UGLY HUMANS' WHEN GROWING BUT LOOK NORMAL WHEN FULLY GROWN WHICH
TAKES ONLY A FEW MONTHS FROM FETUS SIZE. THEY HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN, LESS
THAN A YEAR. SOME FEMALE HUMANS ARE USED FOR BREEDING. COUNTLESS WOMEN HAVE
HAD A SUDDEN MISCARRIAGE AFTER ABOUT 3 MONTHS PREGNANCY. SOME NEVER KNEW
THEY WERE PREGNANT. Others remember contact some way. THE FETUS IS USED TO
MIX THE DNA IN TYPES ONE AND TWO. THE ATOMIC MAKEUP IN THAT FETUS IS HALF
HUMAN, HALF 'ALMOST HUMAN' AND WOULD NOT SURVIVE IN THE MOTHERS WOMB. It is
taken at 3 months and grown elsewhere."

In a letter dated Sept. 1990, written by Thomas Castello and addressed to
researcher 'Jason Bishop', the former Dulce Base security officer stated:

     "...The room for (the electro-magnetic) generator is nearly 200
     feet diameter. This circular room covers the fifth and sixth
     levels (extreme westsouth wing). Here, is the intense magnetic
     generator. There is a 'buffer area' made of ceramic and Latex
     that is four feet thick, in all directions. There (are) five
     entrances (plus an escape trap door on the sixth floor) on each
     floor. Each portal has double door (one at the out-side of the
     buffer and one at the inside of the buffer). The security is
     severe. Armed guards patrol constantly, and in addition to weight
     sensitive areas there (are) hand print and eye print stations. No
     one under ULTRA 5 clearance is allowed near the portals. Here, is
     the device that powers the transfer of atoms. No information is
     available to personnel with ULTRA 7 or less. (I was ULTRA 7)"

William F. Hamilton adds yet another detail in his book 'COSMIC TOP SECRET'
(p. 109): "...According to Thomas, the alien androgynal breeder is capable
of parthenogenesis. At Dulce, the common form of reproduction is
polyembryony. Each embryo can, and does divide into 6 to 9 individual
'cunne' (pronounced cooney, i.e. siblings). The needed nutriment for the
developing cunne is supplied by the 'formula,' which usually consist of
(blood? - Branton) plasma, deoxyhemoglobin, albumin, lysozyme, cation,
amniotic fluid and more." (Note: Christa Tilton described '...strange vats
filled with eerie liquid...where aliens are being grown.' She stated that
there were: 'dozens of creatures in each womb. Can't count tanks, maybe
SCORES or HUNDREDS... womb submerged in sort of yellow liquid. Looks
thicker than water. Creatures float in amber colored water. Womb is
greyish...' The creatures or embryos being bred were 'not human', had
bluish-grey 'resilient' skin, and possessed 'three fingers' and 'two toes'.
She confirmed that parts of human bodies may be used in the 'fluid'. She
says that they used her to breed a human-like child [or children] who is
being held prisoner in the underground base. - Branton)

Researcher Jim Bennett, in a letter to Jacques Vallee dated Jan. 15, 1992
stated the following (It is our belief that even if there is a Fascist-CIA
cabal trying to establish a world dictatorship using the 'threat' of an
alien invasion to foment world government, that the 'threat' may be real
all the same. It is possible that the Illuminati may be working with very
real ALIENS in an end-game designed to establish a world government using
this 'threat' as an excuse to do so, although when the world is under
'their' control the serpent cults may betray the human race by turning some
global government controls over to the reptilians [the Beast?], which
assisted the Bavarians in carrying out their despotic plans in the first
place):

"...1947 brought the passage of the National Security Act, the start of the
NAZI GERMINATED CIA and NSA. The influx of at least a hundred Nazi
scientists, engineers, etc., into the United States and Canada. A Nazi
aeronautical engineer, a certain Herr Mieth -- who had designed four
different types of saucer shaped craft by 1943 using either rocket power or
DONUT CONFIGURA- TION jet turbine engines (rather than cylindrical), with
the cabin stabilized by gyro, the compressors rotating in one direction and
the expansion chambers and vectored exhausts rotating in the opposite
direction -- was traced to Canada in 1947 and began work for the A. V. Roe
company (Avroe disk). The phony AVROE 'aircar' was definitely to disinform
the press as to the real projects underway underground in Canada.

"The eight mile long train that went out of Austria in 1945 (672 train
cars!), to the coast of Brittany, the contents loaded on board SHIPS,
eventually end(ed) up underground in Southwestern Canada. At the same time
over 100 prefab factory buildings were shipped from England to British
Columbia.

"...the Nazis had everything before any other country, they had radar in
1933, they had infra-red sensors, heavy water, etc., etc. We have been told
lie after lie in terms of who invented these things. If anyone in the world
had access to 'alien' technology it was the...'Aryans' (Nazis). Their
metallurgy and casting were flawed or they would have conquered the world.
As you probably know, many expatriot Nazis were given carte blanche, new
I.D.'s., and were included in (the) startup of more than several
departments of the CIA in 1947. Departments including 'genetics and
cloning' (with some of the same 'doctors' who had given death camp
residents gangrene, etc.) 'designer drugs and mind control' using the same
scientists who had designed Methadone and Methedrine for Hitler's maniac
efforts. In 1952, a public stir caused the CIA to shuffle these fab fellows
out of town. My guess is to various underground centers that were being
built.

"...I have talked to Paul Bennewitz at length, several times. On his
behalf, you only tell people how they drove him nuts, not why. I ask myself
why would you leave out that reason why they sent him reeling? (here
Bennett is addressing Jacques Vallee concern- ing his book 'REVELATIONS' -
Branton) To fill you in, because you obviously took Linda Howe's and
Tracy's opinion rather than questioning Paul directly; he's a pilot, he
flew over the Dulce area numerous times on his way between Albuquerque and
Denver. He took many pictures of the construction going on, and according
to Paul, he also took pictures of circular craft on the ground at this site
which, as late as 1973, according to him, had large hanger doors much the
same as Lazar's second hand explanation about the doors at S-4. (All the
stuff from area 51 and 'S-4' having to do with inertial mass cancellation
was moved TO AN AREA NEAR ST. GEORGE, UTAH). The most revealing photos and
their negatives disappeared in about 1975 when various 'fringe UFO experts'
visited Paul. Also, his house was burglarized and ran- sacked more than
once. In later years Moore, Shandera, and Torme made a meaningless tour of
Dulce when they went on to Albuquerque (the real reason for their travels)
to see if there was any more evidence of serious consequence still in
Paul's possess- ion that they could grab, and sure enough, he was missing
some photos when they left his house. If you even talked to Bennewitz, you
would have gotten a lot closer to having a 'revelation'. But by listening
to what Linda has to say about Bennewitz, you might as well call your book
'Heresy'...

"The 'waste' from the underground bio-genetic lab (no aliens involved,
although that is where we humans produce the short lived, big-eyed, big
headed imitation 'aliens') comes out in the river canyon about TEN MILES
BELOW Navajo Dam (Note: An alternat- ive scenario to the above would be
that saurioid 'aliens' ARE involved, AS WELL AS genetically constructed
beings developed by the serpents cults, or the Bavarian Illuminati
scientists working in the Dulce facility - Branton)... Although these days
they 'treat' it a lot more before letting their 'grey' water back into the
environ- ment. This base and others are of course connected by tunnels to
Los Alamos. The Archuleta Mesa installation rivals Pine Gap at Alice
Springs, Australia for security, etc. Every U.S. Air Force base has a
so-called 'bolt-hole' and is connected to this bolt-hole by tunnel...

"A group of 21 people led by an individual we will call Rick, went to area
51 in 1989 in a small bus to watch 'saucers'. They were stopped on
'mail-box road' by two individuals carrying auto- matic weapons and wearing
camouflage togs. One individual popped a can of 'gas' in the aisle of the
bus, and that's all for three hours. When they came to their senses, they
cut their trip short, returned to L.A. and five persons got separately
regressed using hypnotic regressors that did not know one another, and
found that during the lost time their memories had repressed similar
events. They had been marched off the bus, taken in jeeps to a building
nearby, and had their lives threatened by military personnel...

"In the U.S., the group that runs the 'alien abduction scam' can only use
some of the hardiest of these short lived bio-genetic bad luck stories.
Short lived because they have no digestive tract and can survive only about
two weeks maximum after they are removed from the growing matrix, then they
deteriorate and die. They have no 'soul' and are not considered 'sentient
beings' by Tibetan Buddhists." (Note: One would ask, why would they bother?
The REPTILIAN Grays ['cloned' branch -- although there are also the
'polyembryons' and 'egg-layers'] reportedly have no digestive tract and
thus intake 'food' and excrete waste through the skin. Jim Bennett may have
just assumed that, since they have no digestive tract, they were government
creations which died after two weeks of starving. We grant however that
Bennett is right -- according to the DULCE PAPERS -- that human and cattle
DNA may be used to develop "Almost Humans", and other unnatural living
forms - Branton)

"...The army's mind control unit must take well deserved credit for the
veterans who seemingly go suddenly crazy, killing many people and then
themselves. The most recent event in Killeen, Texas was planned for the day
BEFORE a Congressional vote on gun control, hoping to influence Congress
with yet another mass automatic killing. Handlers (psychiatrists) at each
perpetrat- ors's local Veterans Hospital are involved in each and every
case of these mass killings/suicides. Prozac is also involved with each
case having been prescribed by the aforementioned 'handlers' in each and
every case. The fellow in Canada who killed 12 women at a women's college,
the fellow in Stockton, California schoolyard, etc. etc..."

According to Val Valerian, newspaper accounts in the state of New Mexico in
the years before the beginning of World War II indi- cated that the Germans
were "all over" the state exploring caves and mines, buying up land, and
engaging in other activities suggest- ive that they were preparing for
something big. Could this have had some connection with the underground
sub-net beneath New Mexico, particularly the Dulce facility near the
4-Corners area?

Some sources indicate that Aryan or Nazi activity might have a part in the
scenarios taking place BELOW the Nevada Military complex, although possibly
not a major part. It is said that there is a Nazi saucer base near Reno,
and at least one individual reported that he was approached by a man who
was tied-in with a group of (ex?) Nazis who were now at odds with the
Grays, although they still used the swastica on their craft, etc. Other
sources claim that the main "Nazi" fleet in Antarctica is still in
collaboration with the reptilian Grays and that they are working with the
aliens in a joint effort to control the minds of influential persons from
all nations via abduction and implantation. Also other sources indicate
that Germans occultists themselves were involved in 'alien' things long
before the rise of the Nazi Party. One source accuses them of sabotaging
early expeditions to the North Pole, as if there were something there that
they were trying to hide.

Could they have been trying to hide a secret city populated by a race of
ancient hi-tech Germanic-Aryans like the one described by Dr. Harley Byrd?
John Lear stated that such 'aliens' backed Hitler's effort -- by suggesting
that he kill off a few million people in a war, apparently as part of alien
'concerns' about overpopulation. Harley Byrd claims that his uncle did meet
with ancient Germanics during one of his post-World War II South Polar
expeditions, and that they expressed concern over America's military might
and especially it's nuclear weapons. Just how this may have played- in with
Byrd's reputed military engagement with entrenched Nazi forces during
OPERATION HIGHJUMP is uncertain. The master of the city that Byrd allegedly
found "beyond" the South Pole referred to their craft as "flugelrads"
(which is an ACTUAL German word meaning "wing-wheel". Could these
"flugelrads" be the so-called "Adamski" or "Venusian" type craft?). The
"master" also expressed concern over incidents in 1945 when American
fighter jets fired on their craft. At that time, of course, America was on
edge and sus- picious of anything unusual in the skies. For all they know
the UFO's could have been a "Nazi" secret weapon. Although the "Aryanni"
may not have condoned Hitler's genocidal policies -- or did they? -- they
certainly did little or nothing to discourage them. These "Aryanni" --
possibly tied-in with the Aryans who intruduced Hinduism to ancient India
-- actually bid Byrd and his radioman farewell with the words "AUF
WIEDERSEHEN!!!!"

Dr. Harley Byrd, in an interview featured in the FALL, 1993 issue of FAROUT
magazine titled "Harley Byrd; From Dreamland to the Center of the Earth" by
Jim Brandt, said that his famous uncle "went down into the intercontinents
where he sat down with who he called the FUGELRODS, blonde people who we're
finding out now are the lost Aryan race, the super race... they took him
into an inner chamber and he met with a lot of aliens." Some mentioned were
SASQUATCH people, DRACOS, GRAYS, and "HUMANOID PEOPLE from (the) PLEIADES".
Being that the Pleiades cluster consists of over 200 stars, it is possible
that some of them would reject NON-INTERVENTIONISM and ally themselves with
other INTERVENTIONIST species such as the serpent races.

One unusual theory is that planet Earth may actually be a geoditic sphere,
being hollow within and with funnel-like openings at the poles. The Nazi's
who escaped Germany supposedly enter and interact with the 'hollow earth
Aryanni' from their secret bases below New Schwabia, Antarctica. It is
interesting that native American contactee Paul Solem claims contact with
beings who say that they are descended from the 'Lost Tribes of Israel'.
Their ships reportedly appeared en masse over the Hopi Indian reserva- tion
years ago -- inciting a division between the Hopi contemporaries and the
Hopi traditionals. Since the Apocryphal book of II Esdres [ch. 13] says
that the Lost Tribes went BEYOND a far northern country called "Arzareth"
which had never been colonized by man, could "they" have passed through the
northern vortex into the theorized inner concavity? And if so, are they in
conflict or at peace with the "Germanic-Aryans" who dwell in the southern
concavity? As we've said, much of this is merely speculation, at least
until new evidence turns up which can confirm or refute some, most or all
of the above.

Another possible confirmation of a Nazi-UFO connection comes from W. A.
Harbinson, who in his book 'GENESIS' (Project Saucer, Part II)., -- Dell
Books., 1980., -- reveals some remarkable information about top-secret
German developments in 'flying disk' technology during World War II. The
bulk of his book, although based on the authors' own research into the
subject, is admittedly written in fiction or novel form. However, near the
end of the book, aside from an extensive bibliography of
Nazi-saucer-research literature, Harbinson adds an appendix containing many
actual facts concerning the German-saucer experiments around which he built
his novel.

According to Harbinson, one of the most dangerous leaders of the Nazi Party
and founder of the Order of the S.S. (an organization that was admittedly
based after the militant structure of the Jesuit Order, which supplied it's
own advisors for the S.S. movement according to Himmler -- see: THE SECRET
HISTORY OF THE JESUITS, by Edmond Paris., c/o Chick Publications., P.O. Box
662., Chino, CA 91710), Himmler, was initially involved with the 'saucer'
projects. These projects were allegedly carried out in top- secret
underground 'factories' or installations.

In his novel Harbinson, based on various hints and indications that he
gathered throughout years of in-depth research, concludes that Himmler
desired to establish a 'New Order' which involved an elite society of 'pure
bred' Aryans; vast underground facilities constructed within hollow
mountains; secret interconnected colonies based entirely on the pursuit and
development of science and technology as a means to bring about the 'New
Order', yet rooted in occult societies and philosophies such as Theosophy
and Rosicrucianism which taught of the imminent resurrection of the lost
Atlantis and Lemuria; massive projects involving the study of the brain and
how to manipulate it -- including electronic implant technology whereby the
envisioned subterranean master-slave colonies could be operated; the use of
hundreds of thousands of sub-human slaves (or rather those whom the Nazi's
supposed to be sub-humans and who they believed were inferior to the
'master race', themselves), controlled by 'implants' and other mind control
techniques, who would be used as slave laborers -- these including the
Poles and Chzeks. These would be taken to the concentration camps (where
massive mind control and brain-related experiments were being carried out)
after their usefulness had worn out, where they would be killed so as not
to reveal to the outside world their knowledge of the underground
facilities, etc.

Harbinson's scenario also includes the alleged development of a
blond-haired/blue-eyed race which would be integrated with the S.S. and the
subterranean societies as the masters, whereas the sub- humans would be the
slave-workers; and so on.

Harbinson presumes that there are indications that many of the
slave-laborers used to build the 'underground cities' were among the many
who mysteriously 'disappeared' during the war years. Also, he concludes
that German men, women, and children who were deemed suitable for the
breeding experiments were abducted as well. Harbinson also gives in his
postscript section many remark- able evidences that all during the war
Hitler was sending out expeditions to Antarctica where they discovered vast
areas of iceless terrain beneath the Queen Maud Land region, and began
constructing huge underground bases. All during the war, as the 'saucer'
projects were progressing and as new components were developed, the new
components were allegedly shipped via U-Boat to the secret Antarctic base,
where saucer research and development continued.

As the Allies continued to encroach upon Germany, the saucer program
(directed by genius scientists -- one or two of which allegedly equaled or
even surpassed Einstein) continued at a mad- dening pace. At least one
prototype disk or flying airfoil -- capable of speeds of over 1000 MPH and
altitude climbs of up to 40,000 feet -- was successfully flown and later
stripped of the most import- ant saucer components and the shell destroyed,
along with the underground facility at Kahla where it was built, so that
they would not fall into the hands of the Allies. As the war was coming to
a close, American and Russian as well as British forces began to overcome
German forces and discovered many of the underground saucer and aerospace
research factories, where they apprehended many of the lesser components,
documents and scientists (von Braun, Schauberger, etc.), who later became
the basis of the rocket and even 'saucer' projects which were later
implemented in Canada, the U.S. and other countries. These have not been
able to catch up with the German/S.S./New Order/Hidden Society tech- nology
until just recently, if we are to believe the reports coming out of the
Nevada Aircraft Test Site (Nellis AFB, Nuclear Test Site, Groom Lake, etc.)
of advanced disk-craft being flown by the Military.

This German secret society hidden in Antarctica, as well as below certain
parts of South America and other countries according to some sources,
apparently was and is a branch of the Third Reich, the very same forces the
Allies fought during the war (and, some allege, following the war as well).

The documents, minor components, etc., which survived, as well as those
scientists apprehended by the Allies, were of far less 'importance' than
the components, plans, diagrams and scientists which allegedly escaped to
the top-secret Antarctic base. One source claims that as many as 2000 S.S.
[scientists and "breeders" included] and 1,000,000 Germans mysteriously
dis- appeared during World War II and ended up in the top secret under-
ground bases below New Schwabenland/Queen Maud region of Antarctica.

When the Nazi's realized that the invasion by the Allies was imminent, they
knew their fate was sealed as a nation, but the secret core involved in the
sophisticated aerospace-disk research nevertheless had time to escape
before the Allies reached Berlin. According to Harbinson (as well as
certain post-war records and other sources including quotes from captured
German scientists and other researchers), as Berlin was being bombed
top-secret saucer components and plans for massive underground facilities,
etc., were moved by train transport to the Baltics and loaded onto two
German U-Boat submarines, the U-530 and U-977. These U-Boats were allegedly
taken from their docking-sites in the Baltics and to the Antarctic base,
and unfounded rumors state that Hitler and Boorman may have escaped to
Antarctica on these.

Previously we referred to the DRACO, an alien species that was reportedly
encountered by Admiral Richard E. Byrd as well as former head of Dulce Base
Security Thomas Edwin Castello.

What may well have been the most notorious of all 'scares' involving these
reptilian beings, according to researcher John Keel, involved a combined
'invasion' of pterodactyloid-hominoid 'Mothmen' (Winged Draco) AND 'Men In
Black'. These creatures have been referred to as the Mothmen, Winged
Dracos, and Winged Serpents, depending on the source involved. They
reportedly terrorized a particular area in West Virginia, according to John
A. Keel, in the mid-1960's. Keel is convinced that these malevolent
entities were involved in the tragic 'silver bridge' disaster in which
several UFO witnesses and hundreds of locals perished, this conclusion
being based on certain strange circumstances surrounding the event. In his
book 'THE MOTHMEN PROPHECIES' (Signet Books., N.Y.) Keel reveals the
following:

     "...According to her story, Connie (Carpenter), a shy, sensitive
     eighteen-year-old, was driving home from church at 10:30 A.M. on
     Sunday, November 27, 1966, when, as she passed the deserted
     greens of Mason County Golf Course outside New Haven, West
     Virginia, she suddenly saw a huge gray figure. It was shaped like
     a man, she said, but much larger. It was at least SEVEN FEET TALL
     and very broad. The thing that attracted her attention was not
     its size but its eyes. IT HAD, SHE SAID, LARGE, ROUND, FIERCELY
     GLOWING RED EYES THAT FOCUSED ON HER WITH HYPNOTIC EFFECT.

     "'It's a wonder I didn't run off the road and have a wreck,' she
     commented later.

     "As she slowed, her eyes fixed on the apparition, a pair of wings
     unfolded from its back. They seemed to have a span of about ten
     feet. It was definitely not an ordinary bird but a MAN-SHAPED
     THING which rose slowly off the ground, straight up like a heli-
     copter, silently. Its wings did not flap in flight. It headed
     straight toward Connie's car, its horrible eyes fixed to her
     face, then it swooped low over her head as she shoved the
     accelerator to the floor-boards in utter hysteria.

     "OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WOULD SEE THIS BIZARRE CREATURE THAT
     WINTER.

     "...North American Indians have extensive legends about the
     Thunderbird, a huge bird said to carry off children and old
     people. It was accompanied by loud noises, hums, buzzes and,
     apparently rumbles from the infrasonic and ultrasonic levels.
     Known as (the dragon-like - Branton) PIASA to the Indians of the
     Dakotas, it was supposed to have terrifying red eyes and a long
     tail..." a monstrous demon with "bat's wings, and a body closely
     in human form."

Many of these so-called 'Mothman' sightings occurred near some old concrete
domes or buildings which led to several miles of (now sealed) underground
tunnels which were used during World War II to store explosives. It was
known as the TNT area and John Keel reports that at one particular spot he
felt an almost physical sense of "terror" which left when he walked out of
the "circle". This induced terror was reported by many witnesses, and at
least one of the pterodactyloid creatures reportedly disappeared into one
of the dome-entrances in the TNT facility after being chased by curious
witnesses, who searched the dome but could find no sign of the creature.

"...At 7:15 A.M. on November 25, a young shoe salesman named Thomas Ury was
driving along Route 62 just north of the TNT area when he noticed a tall,
gray manlike figure standing in a field by the road. 'Suddenly it spread a
pair of wings,' Ury said, 'and took off straight up, like a helicopter.

"'It veered over my convertible and began going in circles three telephone
poles high.'

"He stepped on the gas as the creature zoomed down over his vehicle. 'It
kept flying right over my car even though I was doing seventy-five.'

"Mr. Ury sped into Point Pleasant and went straight to the sheriff's office
thoroughly panicked. 'I never saw anything like it,' he confided to Mrs.
Hyre later. 'I was so scared I just couldn't go to work that day. The thing
had a wingspan every bit of ten feet. It could be a bird, but I certainly
never saw one like it. I was afraid it was going to come right down right
on top of me.'

"The old familiar symptom, unreasonable terror, took hold of him. 'I've
never had that feeling before. A weird kind of fear,' he said. 'That fear
gripped you and held you. Somehow, the best way to explain it would be to
say that the whole thing just wasn't right. I know that may not make sense,
but that's the only way I can put into words what I felt.'

John Keel related still other incidents of encounters with these fearful
pterodactylons...

"'Look at that crazy character coming downwind in that plane,' Eddie Adkins
commented. He and four other men were standing on the field of the
Gallipolis, Ohio, airport, just across the river from Point Pleasant on
Sunday, December 4, 1966.

"At 3 P.M. that afternoon a large winged form came cruising majestically
along the Ohio River, just behind the airport. The pilots later estimated
that it was about three hundred feet in the air and was traveling about
seventy miles an hour. As it drew closer they realized it was not a plane
but was some kind of enormous bird with an unusually long neck. It seemed
to be turning its head from side to side as if it were taking in the
scenery (Note: Scientists believe that the saurian-reptilian pterodactyls
used their heads and neck as a 'rudder' while in flight, moving them from
side to side constantly as a means of maintaining flight - Branton). The
wings were not flapping.

"'MY GOD! IT'S SOMETHING PREHISTORIC!' one of the men cried.

"Everett Wedge grabbed his camera and sprinted to his small plane. By the
time he was airborne the giant creature had vanished somewhere down river."

In the Alien scenario, basically three groupings have been des- cribes as
interacting with Earth in some form or another. These include the
NON-INTERVENTIONISTS who are mostly humans who adhere to a policy of
honoring another worlds personal sovereignty and independence; the
INTERVENTIONISTS which include the reptilian Grays which are notorious for
their deceptive manipulations of unsuspecting human cultures; and the
opportunists which include both humanoid and saurioid cultures that often
collaborate in order to carry out a common agenda although with different
end-goals. Often these inter-species "collaborations" eventually fail as
mistrust grows and the delicate negotiational balance is lost within the
growing chasm of conflicting interests. In fact some of the most vicious
species wars have reportedly occurred as a result of past collaborations
which have failed. There have apparently been several humanoid cultures who
have passed through the stage that planet earth is now going through (that
is, a process of accepting a technology-trade alliance with the
Reptilians/Grays with the motive of expanding their own technological power
base -- even through the Grays are evil, they are not stupid. They will
NEVER allow the 'recipients' of one of their joint-interaction ventures to
come out ahead of themselves -- and ultimately finding out that the saurian
Grays were offering nothing but a "Trojan Horse").

One such culture that has reportedly interacted with the Grays in the past
[just as earth-governments are doing NOW] and have since come into conflict
with the same, are the SIRIANS. It is believed that the Sirians are
en-route to the SOL system with a large contingent or armada of
warrior-vessels to wage war against the Grays who have infested our system.
Apparently the Sirians have their own "interests" to protect in this
system, including large underground bases that have been operational for
centuries if not millenia. Their race has reportedly interacted with
earth-cultures, especially those of Africa, since ancient times. Let us
hope that this is their ONLY motivation for bringing their fleets into our
system, because if they have an ulterior motive of capturing planet earth
in the process they may find themselves fighting a double-front war like
the Nazis when they challenged the two super-powers of America/Britain and
Russia. If that were the case the Sirians might find themselves directly in
the line of fire between the human vs. reptilian conflicts that seem to be
escalating throughout the SOL system. This is not intended to be a
premature judgement of the Sirians' intentions, but merely what we believe
to be a justified expression of caution.

Researcher Val Valerian, in his LEADING EDGE newsletter, quoted from an
article which appeared in the "CONFIDENTIAL REPORTER", titled, "HUBBLE
TELESCOPE: BIG LIE". The article stated that the 'reason' why Hubble
supposedly 'failed' (some work- ers on the multi-billion dollar project
apparently ordered the wrong size of mirror, so goes the excuse) is because
it did not 'fail' at all. The article alleges that Hubble has seen things
which most people would not believe unless they saw it for themselves.
Quoting from the CONFIDENTIAL REPORTER:

     "...In our history, whenever an inferior culture has been exposed
     to a superior culture, it has languished and faded away. This is
     supposed to be proof that our world cultures will suffer the same
     fate, if exposed to a vastly superior extraterrestrial alien
     culture. In the past, that may have been true of cultures in
     stasis, people who were satisfied with their way of life and
     didn't want to change it. Today, we are in a vastly different
     situation... there is more techno- logical progress in a day now
     then there was once in a thousand years before. We are not now of
     a nature to bow down humbly to alien entities as 'Our Masters.'
     Give us some credit!

     "At least, that is the firm conviction of DR. HANS MARKOWITZ and
     the 'Secret College,' of top scientists the world over. They
     don't accept the politically fictionalized history of man, but
     instead see man as capable of holding his own. And deserving of
     the truth!

     "The big picture, the reason for the big lie, is this: We may be
     facing the greatest war, an interstellar war, that the universe
     has known. Far out in space, in the general direction of Sirius,
     the 'Dog Star,' a monstrous cloud of vessels is moving through
     space. All information obtained to this point has been subjected
     to computer analysis. The indications are that this is a space
     flotilla that will intercept Earth in approximately 12 years
     (Note: That is, shortly after the turn of the century. Sirius, an
     AO spectrum class star being 8.7 light years distant from earth,
     would have been a very likely choice for ancient Terran
     cosmonauts to explore, as suggest- ed by the fact that the Dogon
     tribe of Africa is aware of various aspects of Sirius, including
     it's 'black hole' companion. Also the ancient Egyptians of
     Africa, according to Richard Hoagland, not only interacted with
     the "monuments" of Mars and the Moon, but also gave the star
     SIRIUS a central place in their cosmology - Branton).

     "These vessels, though huge, do not give the impression of
     enclosing vast amounts of useful space, as would be the case with
     freighters, or passenger craft. They are up to five hundred miles
     long, sleek, apparently all technological muscle, and are assumed
     to be military in nature, and therefore likely hostile. Such a
     con- glomeration of power would not be put together to pay us a
     friendly visit! We must assume the worst!"

A more reasonable philosophy might be: "Hope for the best, but prepare for
the worst."

In his article 'ALIEN INVADERS', researcher 'TAL' LeVesque reveals
additional facts concerning the ancient Evadamic-Draconian conflict above,
upon, and within the earth:

"The 'DRACONIAN' Group is a Confederation. They are Reptilian Humanoids,
with sub-groups (The 'Serpent Race', from Sirius)... They set up Bases
inside Venus, the Earth, etc...

"AN ANCIENT CONFLICT -- The Indians of the South-West U.S.A., have legends
of tall, fair-haired Beings. They also have legends about the 'Little
People'. Both are said to have 'Sky Craft' or 'Saucers'. American Indians
speak of Underground Races, Surface Races and people living 'Above', in the
Heavens. The Navajo legends state they once lived Underground (together
with the Coyoteros and the White people) below a mountain near Silver- ton,
Colorado. NOTE: Mt. Hesperus (meaning 'VENUS') is sacred to them. After
coming to the surface they went south and settled in the canyons of the
Dinetah area, (near Navaho Dam, between Aztec and Dulce, New Mexico).

"They then set up defense sites and expanded south towards Mount Taylor and
west into Arizona. Built atop high mesas were fortresses and towers
consisting of three or more stories.

"The Pajaritan Pueblo Indians have a Legend that they emerged from the
INNER EARTH, near the Great Sand Dunes (National Monument) in Colorado.
They then traveled down the Rio Grande, setting up Pueblos. The area now
known as Los Alamos, was considered evil. The home of Underworld 'Little
People', from which would come the curse of 'The Gourd of Death'! (and so
it did) 'The Greys' are 'Deros'.

"According to New Mexican Folk Myth, Montezuma was born near TAOS and
trained by beings who lived in Caverns, inside Pueblo Peak. (NOTE: At
near-by Blue Lake, UFOs have been seen entering and exiting the water.)

"The Aztec of Mexico, who some think originally came from here, believed
that the Sun God needs Blood and sacrificed humans for its' nourishment.
They killed over 20,000 people each year.

"Near Taos, in a Cave (above the Lucero River, not far from Frijoles
Canyon) is where Human sacrifices were made - some say EVEN NOW. (Note:
According to a source from Baltimore, MD., one man encountered a hominoid
reptilian in a cave with black rock walls north of some 'springs' near San
Crystobel, not far from Taos, N.M. - Branton)

"Members of 'Secret Society' groups, in Taos, have been found beheaded.
(Like Arthur Manby, who told about a secret 'AZTLAND' Hot Springs, roughly
11 miles Northwest of Toas. It is flanked by Petroglyphs on the canyon
walls.)

"Cultists venerate the Mayan-Aztec Death God, 'Camazotz', who took the form
of a WINGED CREATURE who removes the heads of his followers who displeased
him. Research indicates the High Priesthood had contact with
WINGED-REPTOIDS (who were known to devour humans) and the creatures were
seeking various articles of commerce, possibly gold, Psycho-active Plants
(drugs), etc.

"Throughout Puebloland, on pottery, CAVE and Kiva walls, will be found
decorations representing a Feathered or horned snake (The Plumed
Serpent)...

"From the Pecos Pueblo, Montezuma is said to have led his followers south
and founded Tenochtitlan (Mexico City).

"THE MANIPULATORS OF THE MIND -- Alien Civilizations have contacted some of
the Earth's inhabitants and practiced various forms of thought control on
those they have contacted. Officer Herb Schirmer, Betty and Barny Hill, and
others were given post hypnotic suggestions to try and make them forget the
contacts. Only through strength of character and hypnotic regression were
they able to talk about their experiences.

"The 'Aliens' USE us, by reaching into our minds directly... WE SHOULD NOT
RESPECT ANY GROUP WHICH USES A METHOD OF INTERFERING WITH OUR BRAINS'
NORMAL ELECTRICAL PATTERNS. They use devices which produce a combination of
flashing lights, pulsating sounds, ELF & E.M. Fields.

"It is also INSIDIOUS to put 'implants' (Brain Transceivers) into Human
Beings. And WORSE, to kill them for their Blood and other nutrient
substances (Vital Energy).

"The 'Greys' (the short, 'Big Heads') are mercenaries. They inter-face with
humans in 'Secret Societies' and the Military/ Governmental Complex. An
interconnected 'WEB' manipulates the surface Earth cultures... The 7'-8'
tall Reptoid/Drac have been seen giving directions to the 'Greys'. The
'Reptoids' get their orders from the Elite WINGED DRACO. (Note: other
sources seem to indicate that the chain of command begins with the
'Infernals' or 'poltergeists' that utilize bio-synthetic physical 'forms';
the paraphysical 'Mantis- Insectoid' beings; followed by the Winged Dracos
or 'Mothmen'; and then the large 'Lizard-like' saurioids or Reptons; the
large-muzzled 5 ft. tall greys or 'iguanas'; and then the shorter common
'greys' and 'frog-faced' amphibious lizards; followed by various non-
hominoid reptilians such as the sea-saurians, giant subterran serpents,
dragon-worms, etc. -- which 'seem' to be used more for 'psychic warfare'
actions and so on against the human race - Branton).

"THE WINGED SERPENT -- The Reptilian(Amphibian) Humanoids have been
interacting with Earth for AGES. Many Contactees and Abductees repeatedly
describe an Insignia of a Flying Serpent on a shoulder patch, a badge, a
medallion or a helmet... NOTE: Snakes...have skeletal indications of
atrophied arms and legs. There have been many transformations & meta-
morphosis. 'The SERPENT RACE' (like snakes) lives Underground. Yet, they
can come out, in their 'Saucers' and FLY...

"THE 'EL' GIANTS -- Elite Cast 'MAN,' the 'Orion Group', have Outpost Bases
inside the planet MARS. They are also known as 'The Titans'...'The
Brothers'...etc."

(Note: The huge 25 km long cigar-ship seen next to a Martian moon -- which
many believe to be a hollowed asteroid 'base' -- in the photograph taken by
the Russian PHOBOS PROBES before the 'UFO' turned towards them and they
lost the signal, may have been an El-Anakim construct (not certain though).
This photo was shown in May, 1992 in Tim White's 'SIGHTINGS' documentary
['UFO Contact' segment] on the Fox network. This 'Mars-Orion' reference is
the only source we have which actually alleges to identify an extra-earth
colony of the giant 'EL' humans, Titans, or Anakim. The Orion star
Betelgeuse is most often referred to in relation to the "giants". Although
we have come across little corroborative information concerning the
extraterrestrial activity of this branch of the human race, there have been
round-about accounts of possible interaction with the Orion constellation.
The 'Eternity Gate', the alleged entrance into the infinite realm beyond
the time-space-matter universe OR a vortex leading to the literal domain of
the Almighty Creator, is believed by many to exist within the Orion NEBULA
several hundred light-years BEYOND the Orion open-cluster. One source
claims that a man several years ago was let down a cable into a gigantic
cavern which had been broken into by a particularly deep 'oil' well shaft
in Texas. The man claimed to have met there giant 11-12 ft. tall humans --
El-Anakim? -- who said that the Creator had ordered their civilization to
remain in these caverns and to separate themselves from surface races where
they might otherwise be worshipped as gods by ignorant humans because of
their stature. This man was told however that this racial 'punishment'
would last until the day of Judgement- Purification and also involved other
things. They didn't say exactly these other things were, however several
years ago one woman who claimed to have visited their underground
civilization -- which was not necessarily such a bad place to live,
according to her -- described her experience in AMAZING STORIES magazine
when Ray Palmer was it's editor. This woman, Margeret Rogers, was allegedly
taken to the underground cavern cities of these giant humans whom she
called the 'Nephs' or 'Nephli' [short for Nephilim?]. They said that their
name for God was 'Tamil', which was also confirmed by the Telosian
'Bonnie', whose people allegedly have some contact with the 'giants'. They
also told Ms. Rogers that one day man may develop interstellar craft and be
so presumptuous as to approach the very throne of God and invade His
personal domain, and thus invoke his wrath upon the whole planet. Another
source claimed that some centuries ago these human 'giants' RETURNED from a
great interstellar migration or expedition and upon returning
RE-ESTABLISHED their ancient vast cavern cities beneath Alaska and
elsewhere. One might ask why would the 'Titans' warn humanity to steer
clear of that part of the heavens -- the Orion Nebula? -- unless they had
in the distant past learned that lesson for themselves? Did they make the
unfortunate mistake of trying to invade the 'Eternity Gate' when the
Almighty Creator had reserved entrance only to those purified human
spirits-souls who were destined for that uncorrupted Eternal Kingdom beyond
the confines of this mundane physical universe? Such a possibility,
although admittedly supposition, is worth consideration. As for the EL's,
ancient records state that they once dwelled in the Middle East and also
the ancient Gobi region, but now live mainly in large cavernous systems
below Alaska, Oregon, northern California, Utah, Texas, Mexico [where Ms.
Rogers encountered her friends] and other parts of western North-Central
America - Branton)

TAL continues: "'The ELs' will engage 'The DRACO' in battle around this
Planet. Most will die. REVELATION 12:7: 'Now war arose in Heaven, Michael
and his Angels fighting against the Dragon and his Angels...'

"The Elite Corporate/Military/Governmental Complex of this country (and
its' connection to One-World control cliques) are currently in negotiation
with the Draco. They have threatened 'Fail- Safe', if the Draco (the
Serpent Race) and their minions ('The Greys' and their human Agents) do not
stop exploitation of the Earth. In other words, an Elite Control Group (who
have moved most of their chosen race, to Underground Cities on the Moon &
MARS) are willing to launch 'Super-Dirty' Nuclear Weapons (from Deep Sub-
City Bases, manned by patriotic 'mind controlled' orphans) to poison this
entire Planet and kill everyone, so that NO ONE can have the Jewel EARTH
('The Divine Tear')... (Apparently they feel that "we" on the surface are
willing to make such a sacrifice in order to keep the earth "human" -
Branton)

"THE SECRET OF 'V'... The following is a list of those Organi- zations
which repeatedly advertised on NBC during the first 19, 'V' Programs, (a
weekly, hour T.V. Series). Advertising support came from 'GENERAL ELECTRIC'

"The 'Reptoids' are returning to Earth! The INVADERS are here. We must
convince a disbelieving World that the nightmare has already begun. Their
Purpose: to make Earth their World. It is not over for the Human Race.
'Freedom Fighters' join together...for the sake of ALL of US..."

Researcher Val Valerian revealed the following alleged incident concerning
one apparent 'victim' of the 'Dulce wars':

"DULCE LAB TECHNICIAN HELD: In early November, 1988, we received word that
the scientist son of (B.M.) is now being held in the underground facility
at FORT WAYNE, Colorado. The under- ground base is located in southwestern
Colorado near the UTE mountains (John Lear states that other former Dulce
scientists are being held prisoner in an underground base in Utah. He
mentioned "Sleeping Ute" mountain, which may be a reference to a peak in
Utah OR a reference to a peak within the UTE mountains of south- western
Colorado - Branton) The son apparently worked at the genetics lab under
Archuleta mesa near DULCE, NM and finally grew disgusted with what he was
observing. Subsequent probes into the retention of this person have yielded
several interesting project names. His father, B.M. apparently encountered
two Nordic appearing men in Pomona, CA on 22 Oct. '88..."

The following information was released by 'Leading Edge Research' in June
of 1992. Although the alien vanguard that is allegedly behind the 'New
World Order' conspiracy is not specific- ally mentioned in the article, a
secret government group, the Trilateral Commission or "TLC" (which is in
turn reportedly moti- vated by a reptilian agenda to the extent of sharing
their pyramidal 'trilateral emblem' according to many sources) is
mentioned:

"During the UFO EXPO West 92 in Los Angeles, which took place a week after
the riots in Los Angeles, I chanced to run into some fellow investigators
who had observed several ships loaded with electronic antennae off the
coast of Los Angeles two days before the riots took place. There are groups
in Southern California that regularly conduct frequency analysis of various
metropolitan areas, and they reported that the Los Angeles area was HEAVILY
DOSED WITH BETA FREQUENCIES shortly before the riots occurred. Beta
frequencies can produce anxiety states, and this most certainly exacerbated
another scenario, which was a control- led exercise in population
manipulation (a product of the microwave mind control experiments carried
out at Montauk Point, Long Island in the mid-1980's? - Branton)

"The enormous media-centered campaign around the Rodney King case would not
have been possible without the approval from the highest levels of the TLC
and intelligence agencies, and it points to a long-standing campaign to
encourage race riots -- a campaign that has apparently existed for the
one-year period between the original incident involving Rodney King and the
trial that ended on April 29, 1992.

"...On April 30th, the Compton Police Dept. revealed that it had arrested
six people for arson, and that when questioned about their activities, the
youths said they 'were on a mission to burn down 10 buildings an hour'
(Note: are some of the L.A. 'gangs' tied-in to secret societies at the
higher levels? - Branton). Their car contain- ed 10 gallons of gasoline for
use in these fire-bombing operations. Law enforcement sources also report
that many of those arrested during the disturbance had identical cover
stories, indicating that there were many such groups under the coordination
and control of someone.

"The Los Angeles riots were in fact intelligence agency operations that
were used to invoke the application of military troops; they were an
attempt to start nationwide riots that would require the invocation of
martial law and FEMA plans.

"Another indicator that the 'riots' were probably an intelligence operation
is that the day before the Rodney King verdicts were released, a mass
leaflet was distributed in South Central Los Angeles by a group calling
itself the 'Revolutionary Communist Party'. If you are at all familiar with
US intelligence agency practices, it can immediately be seen that RCP is a
front for CIA activities. Most 'revolutionary' and 'terrorist' activities
are in fact performed by the very intelligence agencies which claim to
exist for the prevention of such activities. The leaflet said, 'There's No
Justice in the Courtroom -- It's Right to Rebel.'

"...Within days of the incident, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley (who is also
a MEMBER of the Trilateral Commission, folks) used the press-orchestrated
clamor for 'police reform' to put TLC counter- insurgency apparatus in
place which launched a virtual war on local law enforcement, effectively
paralyzing, if not destroying, those functions (could Mayor Bradley and
Police Chief Gates have been two lower-level 'Hegelian' pawns? - Branton).
TLC member Tom Bradley, as it turns out, appointed fellow TLC member Warren
Christopher to form the 'Independent Commission to Investigate the LAPD.'
Christopher, whose 'specialty' is riots and urban insurgency, is a partner
in the law firm of O'Melveny and Myers. In the early 1960's, he and fellow
TLC member Cyrus Vance, then at the Pentagon, drafted 'Operation Garden
Plot', a plan for military martial law in American cities in the event of
'domestic civil disorder'. Of course, there is no distinction made of the
'cause' of domestic disorder, if you get my point.

"Warren Christopher, in fact, was one of the creators of the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), during the Johnson
administration, when he was Deputy Attorney General. LEAA was one of the
early attempts to implement a top-down federal takeover of local police
departments in the U.S.

"...It is apparently a long-standing policy of the Trilateral Commission to
foment civil disturbance and unrest, not just in the U.S. but worldwide, in
order to foster the imposition of world dictatorship.

"Don't stop now -- it gets more interesting. Also appointed to the
Christopher Commission by TLC member Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles, is
a man by the name of Mickey Kantor, who just happens to be the national
campaign manager for the Democratic Presidential candidate and TLC member
(and later President - Branton) William Clinton, who is himself at the
heart of the drug- smuggling operation that was detailed on April 21, 1992
on NBC televisions 'A Current Affair'; drugs have been flown in and out of
the airport in Mena, Arkansas since the early Reagan days, and according to
the television broadcast, both BUSH and CLINTON are aware of it; every time
there is an effort to look into it, THE INVESTIGATION GETS STONE-WALLED BY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. Check it out for yourself..."

The following paragraphs are taken from a document titled "WAKE UP AMERICA!
AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL CITIZENS FROM COMMANDER X" [UFO REVIEW issue #37]:

"...If you were tuned in to Geraldo Rivera recently [1993] you might have
seen an expose of Area 51, a Top Secret military installation located just
short of 150 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas. For it is here at this
vast 38,000 acre military complex -- watched over most closely by Swat-like
teams of private, para- military security guards hired from an outside
agency in total defiance of all known Constitutional laws -- that something
very strange has been happening on a regular basis.

"...More important than the ground-level reports of sincere observers,
however, are the claims of those working inside Area 51, who say that their
lives were threatened when they found out what was really going on at this
locale.

"The first to go public was theoretical physicist Robert Lazar, who says
that he was blindfolded every day upon entering the base and taken in a bus
with blacked out windows to an area seven levels underground. Here he was
put to work on several different craft of extraterrestrial origin, which
had either been captured by the government when they crash landed, or
[were] actually given to Uncle Sam by aliens looking for official consent
to abduct humans in exchange for their technology. Later, when it was
learned by the military -- who placed a tap on his phone -- that Lazar was
scared for his life and ready to talk, the brass had him drugged and
hypnotized so that he would not remember what he had seen or had been asked
to work on.

"According to Lazar -- and here is where his story gets some- what wild --
THE ALIENS AT SOME POINT ACTUALLY TOOK CONTROL OF CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BASE
(PRESUMABLY THE LOWER LEVELS -- LEVELS FIVE, SIX AND SEVEN) BY USING FORCE,
GOING SO FAR AS TO ERADICATE SOME SCIENTISTS WHO HAD BEEN COOPERATING WITH
THEM. Lazar believes that he was hired by the military to replace one of
those scientists who had been 'removed' from the operation.

(Note: According to several sources, a similar attack FROM BELOW resulted
in the deaths of approximately 66 scientists and security officers within
the deepest underground levels of the Dulce, New Mexico 'base'. Others
suggest the possibly that other bases in the U.S. or other parts of the
world may have suffered the same fate. This was apparently the 'reward'
which the saurians or aliens had for those 'secret government' scientists
who believed that they -- the Grays and Reptilioids -- would honor the
'treaty'. We must state however that these scientists might not have been
the willing initiators of such 'alien interaction' but may have just been
following orders from higher-ups who were in fact the initiators of the
'joint' activity [with what they may have formerly believed were benevolent
'space brothers']. This tragedy might be a useful lesson to those who may,
in the future, sell out their own race for physical
financial-technological-political gain... and who might in their insanity
expect to be 'rewarded' by their supposed alien 'benefactors' for doing so.
Unfortunately their 'reward' might be their own elimination as well, when
their usefulness as 'pawns' in an obvious takeover attempt of this or other
worlds has run its course. IF the sub-networks are ever re-taken from the
malevo- lents, there is only one way that they can be RETAINED, and that is
to make the entire underground government base-system ACCOUNTABLE to the
legal system of the United States. It was the actions of selfish
governmental and industrial organizations -- who sold out to the
'Draconians' -- that "opened the door" for the invasion of the subnet in
the first place. If all underground activities are monitored by RESPECTED
Federal Institutions, then renegade elements of government or industry will
not be so inclined to involve themselves in such alien-sanctioned
activities as the Nazi-like genetic-biological experimentation on unknown
numbers of human slaves. If surface institutions must abide by
constitutional law and legal restrictions, then so should the underground
laboratories operated by Los Alamos, Wackenhut, Rand Corp, and other
Scientific-Corporate-Industrial parasites who believe that they are above
the law - Branton).

"Lazar revealed in a series of interviews broadcast over Las Vegas radio
and TV that the vehicles being flown over Area 51 (mostly at night, shortly
before dawn) utilize a previously unknown principle of distorting space and
time, 'using gravity as a lens' with the power source being an anti-matter
reactor powered by some- thing the aliens brought with them called 'Element
115.' (Note: Bob Lazar first came public when he became convinced that
things were out of control at the test site. He contacted popular TV
personality George Knapp who investigated his allegations first by
contacting Los Alamos to see if Lazar had worked there as he had claimed.
Los Alamos said they had no record of him ever working there, but Lazar
said that 'they' were on to him and were in the process of making him a
'non-person' and that is why no record existed of him ever working there.
However when Knapp found an old Los Alamos telephone directory with Robert
Lazar's name in it he started to listen more closely to what the scientist
had to say - Branton)

"From a vantage spot known as a 'Mail Box Road,' near the town of Rachel,
Nevada, a number of different types of craft have been seen by those who do
not mind waiting into the wee hours and are patient enough to come to the
area over and over until they, too, make an observation. Even NBC TV got
into the act not so long ago when they took a news team to the area and
managed to capture on video the flight of something that they acknowledged
appeared to defy gravity..."

Incredibly enough, in spite of all of the documentation suggest- ing the
reality of an ancient and hidden conflict between the human and serpent
races, an ancient Hebrew prophesy seems to have foretold -- thousands of
years ago -- that such a thing would take place:

     "AND THE LORD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT... I WILL PUT ENMITY BETWEEN
     THEE AND THE WOMAN, AND BETWEEN THY SEED AND HER SEED; AND IT
     SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD, AND THOU SHALT BRUISE HIS HEEL."
     -- Genesis 3:14-15

This prophecy has been interpreted in many ways, but perhaps one of the
most interesting of these is one which was penned by an anonymous believer
so many years ago, no doubt in reference to the One who was destined to
deal the death blow that would even- tually result in the destruction of
the 'ancient dragon' of Revelation chapter 12...

     "In weakness like defeat,
     He won the victors crown.
     Treading every foe beneath his feet,
     By being trodden down."

     * * *

So there you have it, the secret of the Mojave (AND of surrounding regions
where exist events that ultimately tie-in with the scenarios taking place
within or below the Mojave).

This desert is and probably will remain for some time a place of mystery
and intrigue like non other on earth. The Mojave, an unknown world within a
world which may well be the 'center' of a conflict between humankind and an
