FIRE FROM THE SKY: Battle of Harvest Moon & True Story of Space Shuttles

by "One Who Knows"

PART 10:

THE FAKE POPE

The fake  pope was scheduled to visit Poland to set off a revolution, but
Russian Intelligence was able to stop it. Having had their Vatican intrigue
spoiled for the moment, the Bolshevik planners in American started down a
different route.

Their agents within Poland started agitation for an independent labor union
to be known as Solidarity. Solidarity was created solely for the purpose of
making conditions steadily worse in Poland until an unavoidable
confrontation would be created with the government. Eventually they were
successful and martial law was declared.

The news of martial law in Poland reached the West early Sunday, December
13th (1981). The very next day the Begin government in Israel launched the
third Christmas crisis. On that day the Israeli government announced its
surprise decision to annex the Golan Heights.

The Golan Heights is along the northeast corner of Israel's border with
Syria, and is Syrian territory. They have been occupied by Israeli troops
ever since the 1967 war and then by Israeli civilian settlements, but under
every rule of international law the Golan Heights belongs to Syria.

As always, the Begin government defended its actions in arrogantly
self-righteous terms as it made a mockery of the rule of law!

World-wide, the reaction was universal condemnation of Israel, and within
Israel itself there was also bitter criticism. The U.S. was in a most
difficult position of what face to show publicly. Time slipped by while
urgent secret decisions were made about how to handle the situation
publicly.

Then, on December 18, the United States half-heartedly announced that it
would suspend "indefinitely" the allegedly new strategic cooperation
agreement with Israel. In response Israel canceled altogether the new
agreement with America.

BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THE U.S. AND ISRAEL STRUCK AN
ARM'S-LENGTH POSE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. This was specifically for the
purpose of freeing Israel's hands to act without restraint later on.

Israel Prime Minister Rabin summed it up with the words, quote: "Annexing
the Golan Heights is the beginning of the end of 'Camp David'."

Well, at that time all the plans of the American Bolsheviks and the
Zionists in Israel were still on track. They were shooting for Middle East
war to break out before the end of the summer of 1982. From there, step by
step, they planned to make the conflict escalate with other crises
continuing to multiply world-wide.

On July 6, 1982 the "ISRAELI" government announced that American troops
would be sent to Lebanon, if necessary. Hours later, Reagan announced that,
"Yes, in principle, he was prepared to send in the Marines as part of a
'truce agreement'."

DIRTY POOL

For public consumption, assurances were given that this would be done under
certain comforting conditions. Supposedly, if the Marines are sent in it
will only be temporary to police a truce, not fight, and only if all sides
agree to their presence.

Doesn't if sound like a rerun - "We are just there to insure Iraq doesn't
invade our little brother, Saudi Arabia," and, "We are in Haiti only to
preserve Democracy." Iraq had no intention of invading Saudi Arabia - then
or later. Saddam Hussein was 'called in' to Kuwait to protect the interests
of the Kuwaitis from being absorbed by the U.S. interests and a collapse
brought on by calling of notes following default by the Kuwaitis, to the
bankers. Dirty pool.

The following day a letter of warning against sending in the Marines was
delivered to Reagan from Soviet President Brezhnev. It was a cryptic
warning containing no specific threats. In diplomatic language it simply
said, "Don't do it."

Anti-war warnings from Moscow were becoming increasingly urgent and
frequent. On July 7 the Brezhnev warning against sending U.S. Marines into
Lebanon was issued, and only six days later the Ustinov warning against an
American nuclear first strike was issued. Does this surprise you? Don't you
remember that little tidbit of news?

Russia's anti-war warnings included not only words but also deeds, my
friends. The Kremlin was run by men who knew that words without deeds were
useless against the American Bolsheviks. That is why we were given warnings
a month prior to this that Russian preemptive measures must be expected to
start taking place. Those pre-preemptive measures got under way promptly,
in the form of warning strikes to send a clear, clean message.

The first of those warning strikes took place on Sunday morning, June 27
(1982). Millions of Americans watched the launch of Space Shuttle No. 4
that morning on television. You watched until the two solid rocket boosters
separated and fell away from the Shuttle. Moments later a Jumbo
Cosmosphere, which was pacing the Shuttle from a distance, fired two quick
blasts at the falling boosters which were no longer visible on television.

The Cosmosphere's beam weapon  blew a hole in the side of each $18,000,000
booster shell. An Air Force C-130 airplane was tracking the boosters and
saw their parachutes open, but when the spent boosters hit the water they
just kept right on sinking. Thanks to the holes which had been neatly blown
into their sides - they certainly didn't float. Recovery teams watched
helplessly as $36,000,000 worth of space hardware sank in several thousand
feet of water.

Embarrassed NASA officials tried to explain away the loss of the two
Shuttle boosters with the lie that the parachutes did not open (on both of
them?). The odds are astronomical against the parachutes failing that way
on TWO BOOSTERS, but they had no other excuse that they dared make public.

WARNINGS!

The *Encyclopedia Brittanica Book of the Year* says of this incident:
"*Columbia's* fourth launch from Kennedy Space Center was on June 27, with
astronauts Thomas K. Mattingly and Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr. Fittingly
enough, it landed on July 4 at Edwards Air Force Base in California,
greeted by Pres. Ronald Reagan and an estimated 500,000 fellow citizens. A
major problem occurred when the two booster rockets plunged into the
Atlantic, apparently because of parachute failures. There was no danger to
the *Columbia,* however. Experiments included the first one to be developed
by a private company. It was designed to produce certain pharmaceuticals
continuously with high purity. The astronauts also helped save the first
'getaway special' when a defective circuit prevented power from reaching
the canister."

Meanwhile, the Russian message was indeed clear. Had they cared to, the
Russians could have destroyed the Shuttle itself on nationwide television,
no less, instead of only the boosters. They were saving our government''s
"face" to use more advantageously during the ensuing years. They certainly
have managed to do that very nicely, at our expense.

Next came the Aeroflot crash in Moscow followed by the reprisal on July 9
against the Pan Am jet in New Orleans (a Pan American World Airways Boeing
747 jet carrying 145 persons crashed in Kenner, LA, shortly after taking
off from New Orleans, exploded, and plowed through four residential
streets; the accident, which killed 153 persons including 8 on the ground,
was the second worst air disaster in U.S. history involving a single
plane.) Both events were acts of war - the secret war which both sides were
beginning to mention openly in public. The Russian message to the American
Bolsheviks here was: "You are not as secure as you pretend you are."

Six days later the Russians reminded the Bolsheviks in the U.S. of their
combined capabilities in geophysical warfare, a widespread sabotage here.
As far back as 1977 we had been warned that the Russians were on a campaign
of planting nuclear mines where they could destroy countless dams around
the United States. Those devices are still there, waiting for use at the
press of a button from a detonator trigger well out of our reach or ability
to control.

How could subversive workers get within our boundaries without our knowing?
They can't There are as many Russian KGB agents in our CIA as Americans.
Our government thought, at the time, the mines were a big bluff because it
was the Russians themselves who announced their presence to our government.


On July 15, 1982, the Kremlin said, "Think again" to the Bolshevik
pentagon. That day northern Colorado was reeling from incredible
rainstorms, the product of Russian weather modification. Dams in the area
were straining to hold back the onslaught of water. Then a low-yield
underwater mine was detonated at the base of the Lawn Lake Dam. The dam
blew open, and the flood waters rampaged down the canyon and through the
resort town of Estes Park. The government frantically tried to cover its
tracks by saying they had been worried about that dam, but the disaster
actually came with absolutely no warning because the dam was ruined
instantly by the explosion.

MORE WARNINGS

The very next day there was still another Russian warning shot. This time
it was couched in the centuries-old language of naval warfare, updated to
the Space Age.

When confrontations take place at sea there are times when a warship will
fire a shot across the bow of another ship. The shot is aimed to barely
miss the ship, whistling past just in front of it. A shot across the bow is
perhaps the most unmistakable military message on the face of the Earth. It
means: "Halt immediately or you will be destroyed."

On July 16 a United Airlines DC-10 took off from Boston bound for Los
Angeles. Among the passengers of the big jet were certain key members of
the Bolshevik ruling group here in America.

For a while the flight progressed without incident but as the jet flew
westward at 39,000 feet a Russian Cosmosphere was stationing itself to
intercept it. The Cosmosphere hovered several miles off to one side of the
jet's flight path and a few hundred feet above it. The charged particle
beam weapon of the Cosmosphere was aimed horizontally to fire a shot across
the bow of the speeding DC-10.

As the jet approached, the Cosmosphere crew charged up the beam weapon for
a maximum energy blast in a defocused mode. This produces a violent air
blast like those heard that winter along America's East Coast and
elsewhere. At precisely the right instant the Cosmosphere fired its shot
across the bow of the oncoming DC-10.

The tremendous air blast just above the DC-10's altitude created a huge
shock wave of downward-racing air. An instant later the DC-10 flew into it.
Passengers later told reporters that they heard a big bang, then the whole
plane shook as it was squashed downward as if by a giant hand. Everyone not
wearing a seat belt was thrown to the ceiling, which is a long way on a
DC-10. Many people were hurt, several seriously; then the episode was over
as quickly as it had started.

The jet flew on to Los Angeles without further incident - but to certain
individuals on the plane, the airborne shot across the bow was meant as a
clear warning! It certainly meant something to the military and government
personnel because they had been warned it would happen. It clearly said,
"Halt now in your war plans or you will be destroyed."

The next warning shot took place on July 22. This was aimed squarely at the
weapons specialists among the American Bolsheviks in the U.S. That day the
first full-range test flight of the Army's new Pershing-2 missile took
place at Cape Canaveral. The Pershing-2 is the nuclear missile which the
Reagan Administration wanted to place in Europe where it could attack
Russia. Europe would be used as a launching pad.

A few seconds after the Pershing-2 lifted off from Cape Canaveral it was
bathed in neutron radiation from a Russian Cosmosphere high above.
Remember, neutron radiation totally deranges all kinds of electronic
equipment. As a result, the Pershing-2's guiding system went crazy.

The climbing missile flopped over on its side, then started cartwheeling
through the lovely Florida skies. Seventeen seconds after lift-off, the
Range Safety Officer pushed the self-destruct button and the missile blew
up.

The Russian message to the Bolsheviks in the U.S. was very plain indeed.
The plans to use missiles to help destroy Russia would not succeed. The
attempt to do so would only rain destruction on America itself.
