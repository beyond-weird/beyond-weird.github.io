     "These people in effect are building their own version of 'Noah's
     Ark'. And that 'Noah's Ark' they're building is underground.
     Underground bases, indeed all over the world, but particularly
     here in the United States. Huge underground bases that have
     actually festooned the underground geography of our continent in
     a way that would probably stun and shock you. But they even have
     an underground government, because you see when the government
     topside is no longer functional because a nuclear bomb lands on
     Capital Hill, or whether it comes simply because the chaos has
     reached a point where they must abandon ship, there is prepar-
     ation as there has been for decades for continuity of government;
     all the computers, all the personnel are currently in place and
     operating around the clock. Yes, they are there friends, we have
     another government in waiting, a government that you never
     authorized, that you never said we would pay for, that has cost a
     CALLOSAL FORTUNE, but it's there underground, ready to take over.
     And indeed, here in our area, I have focused on the Lancaster
     (CA) area as an example of one of the many... but even in
     Lancaster in particular, we know for certain are huge underground
     bases. These are not only places where incredible research is
     underway but also places where people will go to live when the
     'bleep' hits the blades as they say.

     "And, these are places that are capable of supporting on an
     ongoing basis some tens of thousands of people. And so across the
     country it may be possible to 'save' an 'elect' remnant of some
     hundreds of thousands of people who will be the 'cream' of the
     civilization that is meant to survive the apocalypse or the
     downfall... or whatever it is that's out there getting us. Us
     'mere mortals' will have to fend for themselves. The expectation
     is, part of the end game is, (that those on the surface) will
     eventually fight each other into a draw or will die of exhaustion
     or starvation or brutality. And that eventually the 'mere
     mortals' will (destroy) themselves and rid the world of excess
     population, so that the 'cream', the 'remnant' will come forward
     and claim their 'rightful' place... I must say that there is an
     immense amount of evidence which does support this exact
     scenario.

     "Let's talk about the term 'aliens', because there are those who
     claim that there are 'aliens' among us... There are at least...
     three kinds of aliens represented in the evidence available to
     us... (he explains these as those presently inhabiting other
     planetary bodies such as the greys; those hidden among us such as
     human-like beings who inhabit underground, undersea and in some
     cases other-planetary regions yet who often walk unnoticed in our
     societies; and paraphysical entities who inhabit another
     'dimension' other than the one we see with our physical sight -
     Branton) and I think the evidence is very strong that there is a
     profound 'alien' presence among us... these are people who are
     here, beings who are here, in large numbers...

     "But there is this government that has known about the alien
     presence for a long time, a government that has been playing an
     'end game'. A government that has an agenda of concealment and
     control, that is operated by terror. In Lancaster, that agenda of
     concealment and control is what I call the 'Lancaster Syndrome'.
     It produces strange distortions in many peoples lives... First
     let me tell you about a man who sits today in Pierce County jail
     outside of Tacoma, Washington. This man's name is Michael
     Riconosciuto..."

Lindemann states that Riconosciuto formerly worked for a corporation called
Wackenhut which provides special security protection for high-security
areas such as the Nevada Test Site. Michael R. claims that the real reason
he was sent to jail was because he swore out an affidavit against the Dept.
of Justice. In that affidavit he explained that the U.S. Dept of Justice
had 'swindled' the private company INSLAW out of a proprietary software
called PROMIS. This software was a database designed to track special
groups of people according to various characteristics. It was a very
powerful, very capable database. INSLAW developed this in the early 1980's
and took it to the Dept. of Justice thinking it would be a good law
enforcement software. The software would be most useful in helping to track
terrorists and other troublemakers. Certain men within the Justice
Department realized that if they could get control of the software,
according to Michael R., they could sell it to other countries and make
huge profits.

"So the Dept. of Justice allegedly made a deal with the INSLAW Corp. for an
exclusive on the PROMIS software, and then they drove INSLAW into
bankruptcy by refusing to pay. Lindemann continues:

     "The amazing thing is that they were caught. And in 1988 BARONS
     magazine in the April 4th (1991) issue... contained this fairly
     astonishing piece of news: 'Presiding judge in the bankruptcy
     hearing was judge George Basing.' According to BARONS, Judge
     Basing had found that the justice dept. had personally propelled
     INSLAW into bankruptcy in an effort to steal its PROMIS software
     through 'Trickery, deceit and fraud.' On Feb. 2, 1988, Basing
     ordered the justice dept. to pay INSLAW about 6.8 million dollars
     (no doubt to be ultimately financed by the friendly American
     taxpayer - Branton). He postponed at that time a decision on
     punitive damages which could run as high as $25,000,000. And as
     it happens, all of that is all in appeal. The justice dept. was
     not at all pleased with that ruling. It does state that justice
     is in a sorry state in America. If you didn't know that already,
     I hope this helps you to understand."

Michael was responsible for doing the modifications on the PROMIS software
before selling that software to the Canadian government after it was
'stolen' from INSLAW, and so he had an inside track on this information,
Lindemann stated.

     "He explained that the Dept. of Justice, among other things,
     prevailed on him in Feb. of this year (1991) NOT to offer his
     information in the ongoing lawsuit. One Dept. of Justice official
     by the name of Peter Videnicks stated that IF he would cooperate
     with this request they could promise him certain benefits..."
     (including an assurance of a favorable outcome in a prolonged
     custody battle between Michael R. and his ex-wife).

     According to Michael R., the Dept., of Justice "'...also outlined
     specific punishments that I could expect to receive... if I did
     cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee!'

     "Now this is just an indicator," Lindemann states, "that the
     Dept. of Justice definitely has it's own idea of the meaning of
     justice."

Michael Riconosciuto went ahead and swore out an affidavit against the
Justice Dept. alleging grand larceny against the INSLAW Corp. Lindemann
stated that none of the threatened punishments ever came about as they
found an easier way to frame him, "...that is, they busted (framed) him for
drugs, and now he sits facing a possible life sentence in the Pierce Co.
Jail. But because of that he's very, very scared because he knows now that
these guys will take-him-out whenever they darn well feel like it. And so
he's talking, he's talking in every way he can... In particular we wanted
to ask Michael R. something about some of the things going on at the
underground bases. I'd like to read you just a little bit of what Michael
Riconosciuto told us recently about that. I asked him, what did he know
about the underground bases in the Lancaster area. I'm going to quote now
our conversation:

"He said, 'Well, there's extensive stuff in... I call it the 'Edwards
position', and then at Nellis over in Nevada, and at the Nevada Test Site.'
Then he went on to say, 'Last summer I had a group of guys bagging a whole
bunch of files and records, and some equipment out of Wackenhut and they
had a helicopter loaded to the nuts and they got shot down before they
could get out of there.'

"I don't know how many of you noticed,' Lindemann continues, "but there was
an article in the LOS ANGELES TIMES, the 24th of July of this year - FATAL
COPTER CRASH AT THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE PROBED. This was the most serious
accident which had ever occurred in the history of the Test Site. Five
people were killed when this helicopter went down, and the FAA and the DOE
and the National Transportation and safety board all converged on the
Nuclear Test Site to figure out what brought this copter down. But you may
be ASSURED that they will never tell you because it was SHOT down by
Wackenhut, and it contained two pilots and 3 Wackenhut personnel according
to the article in the L.A. TIMES.

"I said, 'I heard about that. Are you saying that that was a group of,
let's say, renegades from the inside who were trying to bolt for the blue
and WACKENHUT shot them down? Is that your allegation?' And he said,

"'Yep!'

"And I said, 'Is there anything more that you can say about this?' He said:

"'Not on the phone.'

"I said, 'Were you aware of that before it happened?'

"He said, 'Yes. I told a handful of people that we were hoping to get a big
stash of stuff out of there.'

"I said, 'Were they trying to get out of Nellis?'

"He said, 'No, not Nellis, off the Nuclear Test Site.'

"And the information they were trying to get out, what did it pertain to?'

"And he said, 'Guess! I don't even want to talk about it. The worst!'

"And I said, 'The very worst, hugh?'

"And he said, 'yep'.

"Now I don't know of the 'very worst,' do you? I mean I'm not really sure,
but it seemed to me, judging from other things that we had talked with Mike
about and some of the other things that we've heard from witnesses in the
underground bases... the 'very worst' could be one of two main
possibilities in my book... The very worst #1) Really nasty, scary alien
stuff. The very worst #2) Really nasty, scary bio-tech... bio-engineering
stuff. There's all kinds of genetic engineering, some of which has to do
with the 'creation' of biological warfare agents, some of which has to do
with the 'creation' of strange bacteria, and perhaps new strains of
chimpanzees and (perhaps) people. There are very, very weird experiments
going on, and I thought, 'O.K., fine, maybe one or the other of those
things.'

"But our conversation continued and it leaned in one direction, so let's
just see what he had to say next.

"I said, 'One of your associates seemed to indicate that there was
technology operating that would have the appearance of flying saucers, but
be absolutely terrestrial. Can you comment on that?'

"And he said, 'Sure, we had some propulsion devices that were, let's say,
rather astounding.'

"I said, 'Is this stuff operational?' And he said 'Oh, yes, it's
operational.'

"I said, 'O.K., so there are vehicles. Would you say that they belonged in
the arsenal, or are they part of a sort of gee- whiz lunatic fringe of
science?'

"And he said, 'Oh no, they're part of the arsenal. It's not lunatic fringe
stuff, it's all well-funded, it's all very real. I've worked on portions of
it, I've worked on teams that have worked on this stuff, and I've seen with
my own eyes. The only thing that I have been shielded from, is any REAL
(alien) contact. That I've never been brought directly in contact with, in
fact, that part has been minimized to me.'

"And I said to him, 'In the way you've said that, I get the impression that
you assume that there are extraterrestrials (i.e. 'aliens') around.'

"And he said, 'I have no direct knowledge of that, O.K.? That's all.
There's alot of strange technology, there's alot of extra-heavy security,
O.K.? Anybody who breeches a certain point of security is instantly dead or
disappears.

"I said, 'Are you saying that given all the other indiscretions you've
shown over the years, that this one would be worst?'

"And he said, 'Yes, I would say so.'

"I said, 'really?'

"He said. 'Yes, Yes! It's like those people who were leaving the Nuclear
Test Site, they were summarily blown out of the sky.'

"Now, Michael knew (he was talking on a prison telephone - his phone was
tapped) indeed, that people who talk too loud, in too much detail about the
actual 'alien' situation are liable to run into severe problems. Being that
he's already in prison and a sitting duck, he's obviously very careful with
his words. But we have talked with some other people who have been more
forthright about what they have actually seen in the underground bases.

"One of our sources is a construction worker. He came out of Vietnam, he
was a very decorated Special Forces soldier. Among other things he got the
Congressional Medal of Honor. And because he was special forces in the
Vietnamese war, when he came back stateside he was offered all kinds of
bizarre jobs in top security. He felt that those would be too restrictive
so he went into construction instead. But because of his military record he
had an inside track on a security clearance. He wound up doing construction
in the underground bases.

"Now you see, the underground installations are built just like a building
is built. You know, you've got to do electrical conduit, you've got to
paint the walls! Whose going to do it? It's not going to be the Secretary
of Defense. It's going to be a guy like our guy! It's going to be like this
fellow whose got a Congressional Medal of honor and now does special
electrical conduiting underground. So he's told us what he saw.

"There's a facility called Haystack Butte, it's on the Edwards (AFB)
reservation... (Note: At this point Lindemann shows the audience a map of
the area encompassing Edwards AFB, the city of Lancaster and Palmdale to
the south -- which is the sight of 542 where the B-2 bomber is assembled,
along with alot of other secret aircraft. All of the major aircraft and
aerospace companies are located in this area, among other sites. It also
showed the Tahachapi facility west of Lancaster, nicknamed the 'Ant Hill',
which is administered by Northrup and which is rumored by some to house
underground 'disk' hangers for wingless aircraft built by the
Secret-Government-Military-Industrial establishment. In the southeast
corner of Lindemann's map the Tejon ranch was visible, which is a large
cattle ranch that goes up into the area of the Tahachapi range to the
southeast of Bakersfield, California. He also pointed out an extensive
underground facility maintained by MacDonnell Douglas, and the Helendale
Facility administered by Lockheed. In this same general area is Haystack
Butte which is 'jointly' administered, with North American Rockwell
involved as well - Branton).

"So what we have here is a situation where you've got our major aerospace
companies heavily implicated. I mean this is what is meant by the
Military-Industrial Complex. These companies are HEAVILY implicated in
super, super secret projects, and at the very top they're all cooperating
together. All the 'bidding wars' and every thing that you see are like mid-
level smoke and mirrors. But at the very top we're talking about projects
that are conducted by all these different people pooling their resources,
pooling their information, and indeed pooling their money, which comes in
incredible profusion from the Black Budget.

"How many of you have seen the book 'BLANK CHECK'?... It is not a UFO book.
I strongly recommend that you read the book 'BLANK CHECK' so that you can
understand something about how these projects are funded without your
say-so, indeed without the say-so of Congress. Most citizens don't know for
example that the National Security Act of 1947 made it illegal to ever say
how much money is spent on the CIA; indeed all of our tremendous alphabet
soup collection of Intelligence Agencies. Whether your talking about the
CIA, or the NRO, or the NSA or the DIA, etc., all of them are in the same
category.

"You cannot say how much these things cost. All you can do if you want to
find out is add-up the numbers on the Budget (which at this writing is at a
deficit of well over 4 TRILLION dollars, a large portion of which may have
been spent on construction for the 'underground nation' - Branton) that
aren't assigned to anything that actually means anything. There are these
huge categories that have tens of billions of dollars in them that say
nothing but 'Special Projects...' And every year the Congress dutifully
passes this bloated budget that has some $300,000,000,000 or more with HUGE
chunks of cash labelled like that -- 'Special Projects,' 'Unusual Stuff.' -
Ten billion dollars. O.K., well where does the 'unusual stuff' money go?
Well, it DOES go to 'unusual stuff', that's for sure, and one of the places
it goes is...into the underground bases. Indeed TIM said recently since the
publication of his book (BLANK CHECK)... MORE Black Budget money goes into
underground bases than ANY OTHER kind of work.

"Now I don't believe that 35 billion, which is the approximate size of the
black budget money that you can find by analyzing the budget, I don't think
that comes CLOSE to the real figure because there is absolutely unequivocal
evidence that a great deal of additional money was generated in other ways,
such as the surreptitious running of guns and drugs. And one wonderful
example of that is coming to light with the B.C.C.I. scandal which I hope
you've heard of... a number of very high-ranking American officials are
caught in the undertoe of the BCCI tidal wave... Even though these guys are
tying to pull 'fast ones' on an immense scale they are getting caught.
These things don't always work. Indeed they are very, very vulnerable.

Indeed this whole 'end game' is very vulnerable and that's why they feel it
requires such secrecy. The American people wouldn't stand for this stuff if
they had the information, and that's the reason why we have to get the
information out and take it seriously because it really is a matter of OUR
money and OUR future that's being MORTGAGED here.

"But my friend who worked in the underground bases, who was doing sheetrock
was down on, he thinks, approximately the 30th level underground... these
bases are perhaps 30-35 stories deep ('ground-scrapers' as opposed to a
'sky-scrapers' - Branton). As I say they are not just mine shafts, these
are huge, giant facilities... many city blocks in circumference, able to
house tens of thousands of people. One of them, the YANO Facility (we're
told... by the county fire dept. director, the county fire dept. chief who
had to go in there to look at a minor fire infraction) there's a 400-car
parking lot on the 1st level of the YANO Facility, but cars never come in
and out, those are the cars that they use INSIDE.

"O.K., so... a very interesting situation down there. Our guy was doing
sheetrock on the 30th floor, maybe the 30th floor, underground. He and his
crew are working on a wall and right over here is an elevator door. The
elevator door opens and, a kind of reflex action you look, and he saw three
'guys'. Two of them, human engineers that he'd seen before. And between
them a 'guy' that stood about 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall. Green skin, reptilian
features, extra-long arms, wearing a lab coat, holding a clip-board...

"I tend to believe that story because, first of all because we have other
stories like it, but more importantly because he walked off that job that
very day. And he was getting paid a GREAT deal of money... If your
basically a sheetrock kind of guy, if you can do sheetrock in a place like
that then you get paid way more than standard sheetrock wages, you can
count on it.

"So, he walked off that job. His buddy on that same crew turned into an
alcoholic shortly after. This is an extremely upsetting thing. You know, it
wasn't like this alien jumped out and bit his head off or anything, it was
just standing there for a few minutes, the doors closed. He has a feeling
that that elevator was malfunctioning, otherwise he never would have seen
that except by accident.

"In another incident though... at the China Lake Naval Weapons Station, up
here at China Lake... near Ridgecrest... they were working there on the
China Lake Naval Weapons Station and walked by a hanger... They walked by a
hanger as they were headed for their trucks to leave for the day. And they
had parked their trucks in an unusual place, a place they didn't normally
park, because it was an extremely hot day and they wanted to keep the
trucks out of the sun. So the Security had given them permission to park
the trucks in a place that wasn't normal. So they walked by a hanger that
they didn't normally walk by, and they looked in, just kind of glanced in,
and saw inside a couple of grays working on something. And of course they
were, you know, astonished... And an MP came running over and said: 'Hey,
you can't be here! What are you doing here?' And they said: 'Well, Security
said we could park our trucks here.' And (the Security Guard) says: 'Well
that's fine, but you get out of here because you'll get yourself killed!'
So they left. But one of the young guys on that crew couldn't leave well
enough alone. The guy we've been talking to said, 'Look, I know what you
saw, I know what I saw. I know what we saw at Haystack (Butte), it's all
for real, I know what's going on, but don't be a stupid jerk. Leave it
alone!'

"This kid didn't leave it alone, and very shortly thereafter he was booted
off the base, and three months later he was dead under mysterious
circumstances. Now of course we can't say that he died 'because' of this.
There's a disturbing pattern of people dying however when they see things
they're not supposed to... Michael Riconosciuto makes it very clear in his
statement to us that if you go past a certain point your dead or disappear,
just like that. We've heard that time and time again. Indeed there are a
great many people on the 'inside' who are making it clear that they would
love to flee, people like these people that apparently were blown out of
the sky, the Wackenhut garbage. These are trained (mercenaries) who have
seen things they cannot stand, things that turn their stomach, things that
make them want to grab evidence and flee for their lives. And they were
blown out of the sky, probably by something equivalent to a stinger missile
or something like that. And there are lots of people who want to get out.

"Just an example of the way these people talk, one of them said to us, 'I
would trade my $100,000.00 a year salary for a job at McDonald's if I could
get out alive. There's a certain despair there, a certain feeling of
entrapment. You see there are the people who know what's going on and who
have created this agenda and have 'bought-into' it entirely, they are
enrolled in it, and they believe that they are indeed the 'Olympians'. They
have to employ lots of normal humans like us to do the sheet- rocking, to
do the grubwork, and those people are in a very bizarre catch-22, because
they are given the promise of a salary that they never believed possible.
You know... they're going to paint walls all day and they're going to take
down a hundred grand a year, this is unusual. That's the up-side of the
deal. The down side of the deal is (you know, and they make it very
clear)... all these people who get these high security clearances are
subjected to INCREDIBLY intimidating indoctrination and intimidation
processes... they really do subject these people to tremendous pressure,
tremendous intimidation, indeed they do inflict great violence on people
(on whom) they 'need' to. They make 'examples' of people..."

In one sense then, there is a growing division taking place between the
Constitutionalists of America and the 'Alien' controlled segments within
the underground bases. This would also include their human 'pawns' who will
apparently do anything, even murder their fellow human beings, in order to
continue receiving the technological 'benefits' from their alien masters,
to whom they have 'sold' themselves and whose agenda of control and
subversion they are serving, whether knowing or unknowingly.

The following is a transcript of parts of a speech presented by Norio F.
Hayakawa, director of the CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK, at the 11th 'LOS
ANGELES WHOLE LIFE EXPO' held at The Los Angeles Airport Hilton Convention
Center on November 16 and 17, 1991. The transcript from which we will quote
is a revised and expanded version of the address written on June of 1992
and is titled -- 'UFO'S, THE GRAND DECEPTION AND THE COMING NEW WORLD
ORDER':

"...AREA 51 is located in the northeastern corner of a vast, desolate
stretch of land known as the Nevada Test Site (a large portion of which
includes the Nellis Air Force Test Range) but has practically nothing to do
with underground nuclear testing. It is located approximately 125 miles
north-northwest of Las Vegas and consists of Groom Lake and the Papoose
Lake Complexes. The presently expanding eastern portion of the latter
complexes is known as the S-4 site.

"This entire area is under the strictest control of Airspace R-4808N (with
unlimited 'ceiling'), prohibiting any entry therein of air traffic,
civilian or military, unless special clearance for such entry is secured
well in advance. By land, the area is meticulously patrolled 24-hours a day
by several tiers of external security even through it is conveniently
covered by the... Jumbled Hills (north of the Papoose Lake area), making it
virtually impossible for anyone to see the facilities without first
climbing atop the hills of the rugged mountain range which became
off-limits to the public since 1985.

"The main external perimeter security is now being handled by Wackenhut
Special Securities Division, part of the operations of Wackenhut
Corporation, a worldwide semi-private security firm based in Coral Gables,
Florida which has an exclusive contract with the U.S. Department of Energy
and handles not only the perimeter security at the Nevada Test Site but
also at many other secret facilities and sensitive installations throughout
the U.S., and U.S. interests worldwide, including ground-level perimeters
for several large underground facilities in and around Edwards Air Force
Base in Southern California.

"It is also important to mention that dozens of unmanned, miniature-sized
remote-controlled automatic security vehicles constantly patrol the
immediate perimeters of the S-4 Site, located around (and presently
expanding particularly towards the eastern portion of) Papoose Lake. These
automatic, miniature- sized four-wheel vehicles have been produced by
Sandia Laboratories of Albuquerque, New Mexico exclusively for the
Department of Energy.

"The outer northeastern perimeters of this area located in the Tickaboo
Valley come under the geographical jurisdiction of Lincoln County and are
relegated to the Bureau of Land Management (B.L.M.). Yet it is considered
highly unadvisable for anyone to even enter the main country dirt road,
known as the Groom Road, which begins its southwestern extension towards
Groom Lake from a point midway between mile marker 34 and 33 on Highway
375, and leads to the guard shack located two and a half miles northeast of
the Groom Lake complexes.

"The first line of exterior security forces (dressed in military- type
camouflage uniforms but with no insignia of any kind whatsoever) consists
of the GP patrols (the 'Groom Proper' patrols, in Bronco-type four-wheel
drive vehicles) who sometimes drive around at night with their lights off
on various country dirt roads adjacent to the outer demilitarized zone,
intimidating any civilian vehicle that tries to enter those access roads
(off of Highway 375) located on public land. The GP patrols themselves
(part of Wackenhut Special Securities Division), however, are strictly
ordered to avoid any direct contact with civilians. They are only
instructed to radio the Lincoln County Sheriff immediately should anyone be
spotted driving on any of those dirt roads. The most common radio frequency
used between Security Control and Lincoln County Sheriff's patrols is
138.306 MHZ.

"...The only area 'allowed' by the Sheriff for such curiosity seekers to
'congregate' is an open area near a black mailbox located at the south side
of Highway 375 between mile marker 29 and 30. Even then, the Sheriff patrol
will routinely stop by during the evening to check on the cars parked at
the mailbox area.

"Moreover, it is our understanding, based on information provided by a
highly reliable source connected to a special U.S. Navy SEAL operations
center, that the mailbox area is constantly being monitored by
high-powered, state-of-the-art, infra-red telescopes set up at a facility
known as Security Control high atop Bald Mountain (10 miles west of the
area), the highest peak in the Groom Mountain Range.

"...It was precisely at 4:45 a.m. on the morning of Thursday, April 16,
1992, that an NBC news crew, dispatched to the area to report on the
landing of an alleged super spy-plane known as Aurora on Groom Lake,
accidentally succeeded in video-taping the first flight (which we have been
calling the 'Old Faithful') of [a] mysterious object while standing at the
mail-box area and looking due south toward Jumbled Hills. The footage,
taken with a night-scope vision camera, was broadcast nationally on NBC
Nightly News with Tom Brokaw on April 20, 1992. The NBC News reported that
it had video-taped a test flight of a new U.S. aerial craft that had
definitely defied the laws of physics, and that the news team may thus have
taken the first glimpse of the other 'deep black' projects (aside from the
Aurora project) being conducted within the confines of the top-secret
facility.

"Also in regards to the ongoing program, it is to be noted that usually a
day or two prior to significant test flights (i.e., only if the test flight
is a significant one, by whatever measure known only to the installation) a
vehicle-traffic counter is laid on Highway 93, at approximately a mile and
a half north of Ash Springs, right before the juncture of Highway 375. The
other counter is set up about a half mile or so west upon entering Highway
375. The obvious question is: in such desolate, less-traveled areas of
Nevada, why should there be such traffic counters installed on undivided,
lonely highways? It is now my belief that the number of cars being
registered that head out west on Highway 375 at such times (particularly in
'clusters', such as caravans) is relayed to several of the security posts
at AREA 51, including the main observation post high atop the previously
mentioned Bald Mountain. However, it is very possible that they may now
have more sophisticated devices for registering the number of vehicles
going through the area.

"The February 21, 1990 expedition was instrumental in the subsequent
production of a two-hour documentary program entitled 'Saturday Super
Special' televised throughout Japan on March 24, 1990 which was seen by
more than 28 million viewers on prime time. The entire program dealt with
AREA 51 and also the crew's pursuit of an alleged biogenetics laboratory
thought to be located just outside of Dulce, a tiny town in northwestern
New Mexico, about 95 miles northwest of Los Alamos.

"...The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory...seems to have a Parapsychology
Research Unit that coordinates its research activities with DARPA (the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). It is my understanding that
some of their activities conducted under the auspices of the Office of
Naval Intelligence are being held at locations such as AREA 51.

"ELF (extremely low frequency) wave-emitting devices, scalar machines,
electromagnetic beam weapons and highly-defined hologramic projections are
just a few examples of the many new types of mind-control 'weaponry' that
the government seems to have developed in the past three decades or so.
Newest researches on special types of hallucinatory and memory- tampering
drugs are part of a growing 'arsenal' that the U.S. Naval Intelligence
boasts to have developed in its own Parapsychology- Mind Control Unit.

"According to recent information provided to me by a highly reliable
informant within a special operations group of the Department of the Navy,
two of the most widely used devices will be R.H.I.C. (Radio Hypnotic
Intra-Cerebral Control) and E.D.O.M. (Electronic Dissolution of Memory).
The first of the two, Radio Hypnotic Intra-Cerebral Control, calls for the
implantation of a very small, electronic, micro-radio receiver. It acts as
a Stimulator which will stimulate a muscle or electronic brain response.
This, in turn, can set off a 'Hypno-programmed' cue in the victim or
subject, which would illicit a pre-conditioned behavior. The second one,
Electronic Dissolution of Memory, calls for remotely-controlled production
within the brain of Acetyl-Choline which blocks transmission of nerve
impulses in the brain which results in a sort of Selective Amnesia.
According to this source, in the hands of certain units within the
intelligence community both of these methods are ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE
USED! "An amazing article appeared in the Los Angeles Times on May 12, 1992
announcing that Caltech scientists have recently discovered and confirmed
the presence of 'tiny magnetic particles in the brains of humans, similar
to those that have heretofore been found in other animals.' (L.A. TIMES,
Section A, page 3). According to the Caltech researchers, it is now an
undeniable fact that every human brain contains a tiny natural magnetite
particle, even from the time of conception. Could the government,
particularly the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, have known this fact for a
long time? The answer definitely seems to be in the affirmative! (Note:
Perhaps the 'Philadelphia Experiment', described in Charles Berlitz' book
of the same name, had an adverse affect on the 'electrochemical' or
'magnetite' particles in the brains of the experimental subjects. Could
this explain why so many of them allegedly went insane after the 'tests'? -
Branton)

"It is interesting also to note that as of this writing, many strange,
turquoise-colored antenna-towers with triangular configurations on top, are
beginning to be constructed along key areas near the freeway systems of
many U.S. cities, particularly proliferating the Los Angeles and Orange
County areas of California. According to several reports, these
antenna-towers are presently being used as relay towers for the increasing
networks of cellular telephone systems being operated by such firms as
Pacific Bell and Telesis.

"Yet the most interesting aspect of the constructions of these strange
antenna-towers is that there are increasing reports that the Department of
Defense is somehow involved in this operation. The frequency waves being
utilized in the cellular telephone communications are, according to several
researchers, strikingly close to the range of frequency waves used in
several ELF emission and microwave experiments of the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory as well as D.A.R.P.A., the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency. (Note: non-digital cellular telephone conversations can be easily
intercepted. This writer has succeeded in listening in on cellular
conversations by scanning through the upper frequencies of the UHF band on
a normal television set! So then, along with the 'mind control'
capabilities, it is evident that cellular phone conversations have also
been heavily monitored by Military Intelligence - Branton) Will these
towers be utilized throughout the nation?

"...A large underground genetics laboratory is thought to be located just
outside of Dulce, a tiny town in the midst of the Jicarilla-Apache Indian
Reservation located about 95 miles northwest of Los Alamos and 100 miles
east of sinister-sounding Highway 666, the only stretch of highway in the
U.S. with that designation and the only highway that links the four states
of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah.

"Perhaps it may just be a pure 'coincidence' that this highway, befittingly
named Highway 666, which originated in southeast Arizona and goes up north,
cuts into northwestern New Mexico, right near the Four Corners area -- an
area that happens to have one of the most consistently concentrated UFO
sighting reports in the country since around 1947... This entire Four
Corners area, especially northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado
also has had some of the most concentrated reports of unexplained cattle
mutilations in the nation during the late seventies and early eighties. Was
something covertly taking place in those areas?

"Even though we could not locate the alleged underground genetics
laboratory in Dulce when the Nippon Television crew and I visited the area
in late February of 1990, I had several opportunities to interview scores
of local residents there that admitted that nightly appearances of
mysterious lights (occasionally accompanied by unmarked black helicopters)
-- darting over, into and out of nearby Archuleta Mesa and Archuleta
Mountains -- were quite common during the late seventies and early
eighties.

"Many of them even claim to have spotted, on many occasions, military-type
trucks and jeeps as well as government vans passing through Dulce and
loitering around nearby mesas. Occasionally even black limousines carrying
what appeared to be 'CIA' agent-types were claimed to have been sighted
'loitering' around the foothills of 'other' nearby mesas.

"We must bear in mind that the Dulce area is only 95 miles northwest of Los
Alamos. Los Alamos National Laboratory is one of the top U.S. research
laboratories specializing in the study of the human genome. Also it is a
vital center of the government's SDI research and development programs.
Just about a hundred miles southeast of Los Alamos is Albuquerque, New
Mexico's largest city, and more significantly, a city where Kirtland Air
Force Base is located right next to the sensitive Manzano Storage Facility,
a top-secret underground military facility. Sandia Corporation, one of the
nations top-secret government contractors specializing in top
military-industrial projects is also located in Albuquerque.

"As far as advanced bio-technology is concerned, I have no doubt that a
micro-chip implantation technology is being perfected in which tiny
micro-chips could be implanted in our circulatory systems, vital organs and
tissues if need be for whatever purpose the future may 'require'. It is my
conclusion that a large-scale research has been completed by the government
(with possible assistance from 'outside' sources) within the last 20 years
or so utilizing tens of thousands of cattle in the Southwest to conduct
this covert experiment. Only recently has science proven that cow
hemoglobin could be substituted (by utilizing a special purification
system) with human blood in situations of 'unforeseen national
emergencies.'

Researcher David L. Dobbs of Cincinnati, OH., described the following
'resume of report received... after the MUFON 40-meter net on April, 5,
1980.':

"...Mike (DELETED), Iowa (DELETED), stated that during the period 1961-63
he performed radio maintenance at the atomic proving ground. He also did
some top-secret radio work for the Air Force at times. The U-2 was
developed here.

"'Area 51' was located 60 miles due east of the base camp, behind a
mountain range separating it from Yucca Flat. Here a secret operation was
performed under unbelievable security precautions known as 'Project
Redlight.' A UFO which had been shipped from Edwards AFB was flown here. It
was not conventionally powered, but was SILENT in operation. Mike assumed
that this was the disc recovered intact and shown in the UFO movie reported
by radar technicians. Security in Project Red Light was so strict that no
one stayed there more than six months. Mike did not see this movie himself,
however.

"While on vacation, he saw a story in Reader's Digest at his parent's home
which told of a UFO exploding over the test site in 1962 while being flown.
This would have been a recent story at the time. Mike is aware of the
conventionally-powered disc built by the Air Force which was publicized. We
both feel that this may have been a cover-up for the real project which he
describes. He also heard the stories about parts from a UFO which could not
be duplicated successfully by aerospace contractors on the west coast, and
many of the rumors about UFOs which have emanated from Nellis AFB.
Incidentally, Nellis AFB operated 'Area 51' where he says the UFO was
flown.

"This information has bothered him for 20 years, and he wonders if it might
be possible for documentation regarding 'Project Red Light' to be obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act."

According to various sources, 'Area 51' in Nevada, where the S-4, Groom
Lake, or Dreamland complexes are located, is the same area where the
Stealth Bomber, SR-71, 'Star Wars' or SDI Technology, and all manner of
aerospace hightech had been developed and tested; these include CIA
experiments and tests. Other names for the 'Dreamland' complex include:
'The Ranch' or 'The Skunk Works'. This is where Francis Gary Powers, who
flew the ill-fated U-2 spy plane mission which was shot down over Russia
(where Powers was held prisoner for some time), was trained. Incidentally,
there are also rumors that the vast caverns which have been excavated by
the underground nuclear blasts in the adjacent Nevada Nuclear Test range,
have been and are being connected by underground tunnels and used for top
secret purposes. If this is the case one may wonder how the problems of
radiation residue were solved... [via 'clean' nuclear blasts?]

Referring to the subsurface regions, we quote now from yet another item
that appeared in the N.A.R. newsletter, which was titled, 'IS INNER EARTH
RESEARCH HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH?':

"An observation has recently been made that most of the outstanding inner
earth researchers have died of heart attack (Note: Heart attack is
reportedly one weapon or method of psychic attack that is recognized by
those occultists who are familiar with 'voodoo' or 'psychic' warfare. Heart
Attacks of this nature are allegedly induced by the use of intense TERROR
that is 'projected' against individuals by the initiators of such attack.
It is alleged that hominoid non-human beings such as the serpent races
might have the ability to direct psychic attacks against human beings via
the use of black magic, witchcraft or sorcery. It is interesting that there
have been very few if any UFOlogists, etc., who claim to have taken up a
devout 'Christian' lifestyle, who have physically suffered the 'negative'
side of UFO research -- including encounters with MIBS, abductions,
paralysis, heart attacks or other FEAR-ORIENTED forms of victimization.
This suggests that a deep FAITH in the Creator may neutralize the FEAR that
the aliens seem to depend on as their major "weapon" in their psychic
attacks against humankind, making the 'believers' impervious to their
otherwise destructive influences - Branton). Surely, this is beyond a
simple coincidence. GRAY BARKER, DICK SHAVER, and JOAN O'CONNEL [New
Atlantean Journal] are but a few (also, researcher CHARLES MARCOUX -
Branton). Locally, there are several inner earth researchers who are very
notable in their persistence.

"Lew Tery, who has recently relocated to Utah, was the foremost local
proponent of (the) geomagnetic vortex/UFO connection theory. Lew was
instrumental in the discovery of underground tunnel networks in the Las
Vegas area, one of them being between the base of Boulder Dam and Jumbo
Peak, where there are two mines whose owners view 200' diameter disks on a
frequent basis. At one point, Lew offered to set up an interview with these
miners. Alas, Mr. Tery is not to be found.

"A local Henderson resident, who shall remain nameless, has been into inner
earth research for years. This person has been hounded and chased due to
intimate knowledge of inner earth tunnels in the local area.

"There is obviously something here that some people wish to protect.
Something to hide. Many seem to know what it is, and they speak cautiously
about REPTILIAN HUMANOIDS and the SERPENT RACE, which are two subjects
which seem to be surfacing again. Response to local television and radio
programs featuring JOHN LEAR have been overwhelming. A recent lecture in
Las Vegas drew over 700 people.

"According to some sources, the 'Greys' are the lower level of a bigger
scenario that involves this reptilian race..."

The following is a transcript of a letter which was sent by John Lear to
researcher TAL LeVesque. The letter, dated October 6, 1990, states:

     "Dear TAL... Many thanks for your recent, very interesting
     letter. I showed it to Bob (i.e. Lazar - Branton) and he thinks
     we are both crazy. He does not believe that Dulce exists. Bob
     went through extreme brainwashing at S-4 so I can understand his
     feelings. About the time that he was brainwashed, maybe a little
     before, he told me that Dulce was mentioned up there once or
     twice in conversations that he was not part of...but that he
     overhead. Since that time he has forgotten even that part. Since
     I know Dulce exists, what Bob thinks does not affect me in the
     least.

     "A source of mine that is a security guard at the test site tells
     me that currently there are 5 types of aliens there: The Greys,
     the Orange, the reptilians, the ones that look like [the aliens]
     in the movie 'V' and the ones that look so ugly that they take
     your breath away until you get used to looking at them.

     "I now believe that a very large Saucer crashed near Sedona,
     possibly 2 years ago and is in the process of being retrieved in
     sections, as it is too big to remove in one piece.

     "The recent stories in Aviation Week, I believe, are attempts to
     buy more time, to mislead the public and to confuse the issue
     (Note: Lear is here referring to the article in the Oct. 1, 1990
     issue of AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, titled "Secret
     Advanced Vehicles Demonstrate Technologies For Future Military
     Use". The article referred only to the fairly well-known super-
     advanced jets being tested in Nevada, giving the impression that
     these may explain all of the 'UFO' sightings in the area -
     Branton).

     "Again, I appreciate very much your fascinating letter and look
     forward to more information on Dulce... With much respect and
     admiration... JOHN LEAR."

In connection with the subject of this File, that is the 'invasion' of an
alien race from above and below utilizing mind-bending techniques,
psychological warfare, mind control and implantation, we will quote from
Brad Steiger's 'THE UFO ABDUCTORS' (1988., Berkley Books., N.Y.):

"In 1969 I and my research associates... Loring G. Williams and Glenn
McWane, were bombarded with the claims of dozens of contactees who said
that they had had an implant left somewhere in their skulls, usually just
behind the left ear. These contactees/abductees came from a wide variety of
occupations, cultural backgrounds, and age-groups.

"We employed private detectives and medical doctors... in an attempt to
learn what archetype had been fed into their particular group
consciousness. We never found any implants that were detectable to X rays,
but our hypnotic sessions turned up an incredible amount of fascinating,
albeit bizarre, information about underground UFO bases, hybrid aliens
walking among us, and thousands of humans slowly turning into automatons
because of readjusted brain wave patterns.

"...Dagmar and Carl R. have a farm in northeast Iowa about forty miles from
the Mississippi River. One night in August of 1982, Carl observed what he
called at the time a 'lantern in the sky' that hovered over him while he
was working late in the field...

"In October that year, while Carl was working late in the field preparing
for the annual corn harvest, he was startled to see the glowing 'lantern'
return to the sky above him. It appeared to be the same object that he had
seen in August.

"Although he tried to remain oblivious to the object, it seemed to be
hovering above him, even following him up and down the corn rows. He became
nervous and disconcerted and went back to the farmhouse, where he asked
Dagmar to come out and witness the strange object.

"Dagmar was able to see the object, too, and they stood and watched it for
several minutes before it suddenly moved high into the night sky and then
sped off at a great rate of speed in a westerly direction.

"About three the next morning, Carl was awakened by the sound of cattle
bellowing nervously in the stockyard. As he got out of bed and looked out
the bedroom window, he saw a disk- shaped object hovering above the
barnyard. It was glowing in a kind of greenish color..."

Following this, the couple was 'tranquilized' by the object or its
occupants somehow, possibly by some kind of intoxicating, pacifying or
STIM-ulating ray which apparently induced a drugged or trance-like
electrochemical reaction in their brains and bodies, after which they were
taken by some entities. A conventional 'abduction' sequence ensued, similar
to that described by so many thousands of others. Steiger related the
couples' afterthoughts concerning their abduction by 'smallish' large-eyed
beings "with only nostril openings (rather than a pronounced nose) and with
tight, expressionless lips."

Steiger continues: "While the young Iowa couple can remember no further UFO
interaction since that particular autumn, they both admit to being nervous
about having another encounter. Carl, especially, feels that he was used.
Dagmar speculated that bits of her skin tissue might have been removed in
the examination, and although she does not claim to be an expert in such
matters, she wonders if enough of her body could be cloned in a way to
interact with whatever embryo or fetus might have been fathered by the
semen that was taken from her husband (Note: Dagmar claimed that during one
part of the 'examination' a needle-like object was stuck into her abdomen.
Many believe that this is one process by which the 'entities' extract ovum
from human females - Branton).

"Not wanting to sound like victims of some science fiction thriller, the
young couple have theorized that they might have been used in some strange
program of creating hybrid beings. Perhaps, they suggest, Carl's semen was
used to impregnate an alien female or an Earth female, who is somehow
influenced by and under the control of alien beings. In either event, they
are uncomfortable with the experience and with the memory of the encounter.
Both of them feel as though they may have been used in ways opposed to
their normal expression of will.

"Dagmar has gone even farther in her speculations by suggesting that if
bits of her body could have been used to create a clone and if Carl's semen
could somehow be used at a future time to impregnate such a clone, then
alien beings could be breeding their own brand of humans as part of an
organized program to create an army of human-like robots that would be
totally under control of aliens in their master plan to conquer Earth.

"UFO investigator Richard Siefried was told by Pam Owens that she was taken
aboard a UFO on November 25, 1978, while she was expecting a child. She was
nineteen at the time, and she had no memory of the abduction until she was
hypnotically regressed. Then she was able to give full and fascinating
details of her encounter.

"Mrs. Owens told Siefried that she was paralyzed and able to move only her
eyes. She lay helpless on a table and stared up in terror at two
weird-looking creatures.

"According to Mrs. Owens, their heads were hairless, oversize domes, their
eyes were big and sunk back in their skulls. The greenish skin covering
their bodies was coarse. Each hand had four fingers that she described as
being twice as long as a human's. And to her terror, one of those strange
hands was holding a long silver needle, preparing to plunge it into her
stomach..."

Dr. Clifford Wilson [M.A., B.D., Ph.D.], in his book "UFOS... AND THEIR
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE" (Signet Books., N.Y.) presents his own 'intelligence'
or research concerning the on- going invasion/infiltration of our society
by alien powers:

"...Not only have many seen UFOs, but there is also a growing army of those
who claim to have had actual contact with UFO occupants. An authoritative,
and possibly conservative, estimate is that there are 50,000 silent
contactees in the United States alone.

"It could well be there are thousands of people who do have information and
are not prepared to reveal it because of threatened consequences to
themselves. Possibly many do not know they have that 'knowledge' because
they themselves gained it in a hypnotic state.

"HYPNOTIZED SLAVES AWAIT A SIGNAL - Nations could be conquered by the
infiltration of agents into government seats of authority, and it is surely
more frightening to think that mankind could be overcome and even destroyed
by programmed men and women from within their own ranks. If there is indeed
a final confrontation approaching, an army of people could be involved.
They could be ready to take action which they themselves do not even
anticipate, but yet with no option but to obey because they have been
conditioned to obey, at a given signal.

"We are not alone in suggesting this dreadful possibility. To quote John
Keel once again:

"'We have no way of knowing how many human beings throughout the world have
been processed in this manner, since they would have absolutely no memory
of undergoing the experience, and so we have no way of determining who
among us has strange and sinister 'programs' lying dormant in the dark
corners of his mind.

"'Suppose a plan is to process millions of people and then at some future
date trigger all of those minds at one time? Would we suddenly have a world
of saints? Or would we have a world of armed maniacs shooting at one
another from bell towers?'

"If Armageddon, to which the Bible points, is indeed a final battle in
which human and nonhuman forces alike wage that dreadful conflict to the
death, this sort of 'programming' is a real possibility, and it appears to
be proceeding at breakneck speed across the whole of the world. It is
reported that the term 'Armageddon' has been used in a message to a
contactee and other 'end of the world' messages have been given. Is there a
desperate preparation for a last-ditch stand by the forces of evil, a final
attempt to thwart the plans of the Holy God against Whom they have
rebelled? Bible history gives many examples where Satanic forces have
attempted completely to destroy God's plans that would result in total
blessings for man. There has continually been a diabolical scheme to
bending minds by deceitful assurances and 'brainwashing.' Post-hypnotic
suggestions, with in-built commands for action to be triggered at a given
signal, would fit the general pattern of rebellion consistently seen in the
Bible records.

"A FRIGHTENING PROSPECT - The prospect if frightening. It is entirely
possible that by post-hypnotic suggestion a whole army of people could
suddenly find themselves willing slaves of intelligent beings who care
nothing for the welfare of those slaves, or of the world itself as we know
it. If there is some great super- plan of a spiritual counterattack to
reach its culmination in Armageddon, it could well be that (this) army of
slaves will be available to obey orders, without even knowing beforehand
that they have been inducted into the armed forces of what the Bible refers
to as the principalities and powers.

"The indications are that even children are at times utilized for the
implementation of the plans of these evil powers. That possibility is
illustrated by the following incident.

"On December 12, 1967, Mrs. Rita Malley was driving along a public highway
to her home at Ithaca, New York, with her five- year-old son Dana in the
back seat of her vehicle. At about 7:00 P.M. she suddenly realized that a
red light was apparently following her, and as she was moving above the
speed level, her first reaction was that she was about to be pulled over.
She looked through her window and found that it was not a police car behind
her but an eerie flying object, moving along above the power lines at the
left of her car. Then she found she no longer had control of her vehicle,
and shouted to her son to brace himself. However, he remained motionless as
though he were in a trance.

"A white beam of light flashed down from the vehicle overhead, then she
heard voices that sounded weird, broken, and jerky. She herself became
hysterical, but through it all her son took no notice whatever of her
cries. The radio was not on, but she heard those voices tell her that at
that moment a friend of hers had been involved in a terrible accident some
miles away. The next day she found that this was indeed true. The voices
also told her that her son would not remember anything that had happened.
The ordeal was terrifying to Mrs. Malley herself, and for some time
afterward whenever she remembered the episode she would break down sobbing.

"...It would seem possible, then, that pliable children are especially
useful for the purposes of these beings. Many children have been used as
tools so that men and women would believe in these beings who have a plan
whose totality has not yet been revealed.

"...These incidents are not limited to children. Mrs. Ralph Butler was
watching flashing lights outside Owatonna in Minnesota one night in
November, 1966. She was with a friend, and suddenly her friend became
immobile, with her head dipped down. Mrs. Butler herself heard a voice
talking to her, but soon the ordeal was over. However, when the two friends
tried to discuss the incident later, both found they immediately suffered
blinding headaches. Mrs. Butler also told of hearing strange voices on her
radio, and of having peculiar visits from 'air force officers.' This
pattern is reported by many who claim to have been contacted by UFO
personnel.

"The Butler family have experienced various poltergeist phenomena since
that 1966 experience -- glass objects moving around and breaking without
any known cause, strange noises being heard throughout the house, even
telephones and television sets being strangely interfered with (Note: Such
activity often occurs during UFO encounters where there seems to be a
COLLECTIVE involvement of paraphysical 'Poltergeists' or 'Infernals',
Reptilians, and possibly 'controlled-cybernetic' Men In Black -- such
activity as is typical of the malevolent powers that have allegedly
established bases or 'empires' in systems such as Alpha Draconis, Epsilon
Bootes, Altair Aquilla, Zeta Reticuli, Bellatrix Orion, and Rigel Orion as
well as their Solarian-subTerran counterparts - Branton).

"This sort of activity has followed many other supposed saucer sightings.
The similarities between the stories are of such a nature as to cause
surprise at first -- someone temporarily in a trance, men posing as air
force or other officials, those men being slight in stature with dark olive
skins and pointed features, and the contactees having dreadful headaches,
hallucinations, and nightmares. Some of them have gone into trances and
have temporarily become mediums through whom strange voices could be
heard...

"A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT? -- Is there to be an attempt at a takeover? There
surely are limitations to the life-giving powers of these UFO creatures...
Man is the master of the ANIMALS, and despite seemingly way-out theories,
such as monster INSECTS waiting to attack us, in fact man is still able to
control the LESSER creatures... (Note: That is unless man accepts the
propaganda and lies of the such lesser 'beasts' as the serpent races, etc.,
such as their claim that they created us genetically and are therefore our
'gods'. IF man believes such trash then he WILL NOT try to resist and
appropriate the God-given dominion over these 'beasts' which the Creator
has given to MAN-KIND. Not all, but MUCH of the power that the 'aliens'
wield over humanity is the power that WE ourselves have capitulated or
yielded to them, if we are to trust the Judeo-Christian version of history
as a reality - Branton).

"EVIL FORCES ARE REAL - Even apart from my strong Christian beliefs, and my
acceptance of the Bible as the revealed Word of God, I would have no doubt
whatever as to the fact of spiritual beings, evil forces, and phenomena
that cannot be explained by purely physical, psychical, or psychological
concepts.

"If there is truth in this hypothesis, preparations would be going on --
just in case these overheard futurist interpretations happened to be
correct..."

On July 30, 1992, radio announcer and reporter for RADIO FREE AMERICA,
Anthony J. Hilder, sent the following letter to Patty Cafferata., Lincoln
County District Attorney., Pioche, Nevada 89043., 702-962-5171. Several
dozen copies were sent by Hilder to other researchers as well as several
activist, political, legal, media, patriot, congressional, and (real)
'National Defense' officials:

"Dear Mrs. Cafferata: I am calling on the Attorney General of the State of
Nevada to initiate an immediate 'FULL SCALE' Grand Jury Investigation into
the activities of the Wackenhut S.S., your office and the Lincoln County
Sheriff's Department. The reason for the urgency of this action is because
of the rapidly increasing number of 'LIFE THREATENING' situations CREATED
by unidentified paramilitary personnel who operate under the color of law
to harass, intimidate and suppress the constitutional rights of many
hundreds of American citizens and Japanese nationals who come to view the
Unidentified Flying 'Saucer-Shaped Disks' being tested over your county.

"It is my prayer that with the prodding of the people and the press that
the Attorney General will launch 'this investigation' in time to avert one
of these innocent individuals from being murdered by that paramilitary mob
or winding up as a permanent prisoner in one of the 'strange' underground
'experimental laboratories' below Dreamland and S-4 within the Nellis Test
Range.

"During my conversation with you on the afternoon of June 6, I made
repeated attempts to acquire the names of six individuals who were arrested
last month by the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department somewhere in the
Tickaboo Valley. As a reporter, I sought your professional cooperation. I
did not get it.

"Not only did you refuse to reveal the names of those arrested and their
'alleged' violation of law -- you continually badgered me for my home
address, phone number and specifically just what radio stations would be
broadcasting the story. Could it be that you wanted to 'cover-up' the
story? As I stated, I simply wanted to cover the event.

"I am curious as to the reason you would attempt to prevent the media from
reporting the arrest. Obviously you didn't want me to contact those people
for their side of the story before their arraignment. Is there something
you fear from honest disclosure? What is it that you don't want to know?
Could it be that these arrests were illegal?

"Did the Sheriff's Department violate 'the constitutional rights' of these
citizens, Mrs. Cafferata? Has it become the policy of Lincoln County
Sheriff's Department WITH YOUR APPROVAL and under the color of law, to
'HARASS AND INTIMIDATE' the curious onlookers who come to your county to
sit beneath the stars in the high desert, hoping to see and possibly
photograph the strange and 'alien lights' in the night sky for which that
region has now become famous? Is this a crime in Nevada? One might wonder
if Lincoln has now become the first county in a 'Hitlerian Superstate' of a
NEW WORLD ORDER -- where freedoms are suppressed and terror tactics are
'public policy'?

"...It's definitely not a TOP SECRET that what's going on within the bowels
of those underground bunkers at S-4 and Area 51 in the Nellis Test Site is
'ABOVE TOP SECRET'. Obviously there's something very strange going on out
there that the 'BLACK PROJECT BOYS' have to hide regardless of what it
costs. If the public were to become aware of what these 'Dr. Strangelove's'
were 'creating' in those underground laboratories -- I believe the world
would be shocked and horrified beyond all belief.

"Need I remind you that it is your responsibility as District Attorney of
Lincoln County to UNCOVER -- NOT COVER UP crimes that are being committed
in your county. Other questions arise. Is there a dereliction of duty by
the District Attorney's office? Do you have a conflict of interest? And for
whom do you serve?

"I am deeply concerned as is the American Civil Liberties Union in seeing
that the constitutional rights of all Americans who live in or pay a visit
to Lincoln County are PROTECTED -- NOT VIOLATED by the WACKENHUT S.S.
(Security Service), your Sheriff's Department, or anyone else.

"Correct me if I am wrong, but at one time or another did you not take some
sort of oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States? Or
is the Lincoln County District Attorney EXEMPT from upholding such
'antiquated trivialities' as the United States Constitution?

"Would you be willing to share with me information as to how and why the
Wackenhut S.S. is ALLOWED by your office under the color of law to STOP,
INTIMIDATE AND HARASS 'sightseers' on PUBLIC land? Are they 'ABOVE THE
LAW'? Are they IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION?

"What law is it that allows the WACKENHUT S.S. to drive unlicensed vehicles
on county roads in the state of Nevada at speeds far exceeding the posted
limit? Does your office now allow them to search sightseers' vehicles
without warrants? Maybe some judge in Lincoln County issued them 'POCKET
WARRANTS'? And if so, what judge has the legal authority in this country to
issue such 'invisible warrants' to the WACKENHUT S.S. or any other
PARAMILITARY MOB? What law gives you the legal authority to allow the
WACKENHUT S.S. to stop, interrogate and intimidate sightseers, tourists,
campers and naturalists? Or for that matter, do they need ask your
permission at all? Are they a law unto themselves?

"Are these 'HITLERIAN HARASSERS' CIA, NSA, 'Black Project', U.N. or
paramilitary personnel? Just where is the law in Lincoln County? Asleep? Or
do you simply WINK YOUR EYE at all those Orwellian incidents?

"The obvious collusion between Wackenhut and the Sheriff's Department
necessitates that these questions be asked. It has become EVEN MORE
NECESSARY to prevent our freedoms from disintegrating -- that these
questions be answered.

"Who are these men who stand behind LOADED FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, show NO
IDENTIFICATION, wear camouflaged clothing, DISPLAY NO BADGES, wear no
emblems, drive unlicensed vehicles and who show no warrants when they stop
and interrogate American citizens on American soil? They demand to see
identification, social security cards, driver's licenses, take pictures of
the sightseers, record their conver- sations, search their cars and write
down the license plate numbers for 'zher files' just like in Nazi Germany.
They have even on occasion drawn their weapons and aimed them at American
citizens -- with what can only be described as INTENT TO KILL -- should the
'sightseers' not instantly obey their commands. Surely you must be aware
that all this is taking place on public 'tax-payer owned' land in your
county. Why are you allowing this, Mrs. Cafferata?

"Who are these paramilitary people that you seemingly protect from
prosecution? Under whose authority do these NEO- FASCIST FORCES operate?
Yours? MJ-12? Some cryptic banking cartel? The Skull and Bones? The Jason
Society? Global 2000? The Tri-Lates? I know it's not the Boy Scouts, Mrs.
Cafferata. Just who is running the show?

"I doubt seriously that the average citizen of Lincoln County who pays your
salary has any idea what's going on. I feel quite certain that the
residents of Rachel, Pioche and Alamo haven't secretly met with you in some
obscure smoke-filled back-room to persuade you to make sure that the
WACKENHUT S.S. remains 'immune' from criminal prosecution.

"I don't quite understand why you're doing what you're doing or rather NOT
DOING. Does somebody have some sort of hold on you? Does some 'secret
society' pay for your co-operation? or are you and the Sheriff's Department
just working with the Wackenhut S.S. VOLUNTARILY, without pay?

"In Nazi Germany, Hitler had a quasi-government group called the S.S.
Beyond their borders, they called the collaborators WAFFEN S.S. They were
authorized by the Fuhrer to operate 'BEYOND THE LAW'. Is this the case in
Lincoln County? Has the Wackenhut S.S. replaced the WAFFEN S.S.?

"Under what law have you allowed unmarked black helicopters to buzz, harass
and threaten the lives of tourists in Lincoln County? If these aircraft are
not, by the law, allowed to threaten the lives of people who come to
Tickaboo Valley 'to see the sights', then why hasn't your office prosecuted
these criminals? Are they above the law? Or has 'SELECTIVE PROSECUTION'
replaced CRIMINAL JUSTICE in Lincoln County?

"Are you ready to testify in a court of law that you are 'unaware' that
BLACK HELICOPTERS have been swooping down upon innocent travelers -- in an
attempt to scare them or try to kill them?

"...If you don't recollect any such incident, let me remind you but one.
Norio Hayakawa, Gary Schultz and a party of sightseers were buzzed by an
unmarked helicopter -- in a LIFE- THREATENING MANNER in May of 1991.

"Under what law do you allow such outrage to occur over Lincoln County
roads? Have you bothered to even so much as 'discuss' this attack with
those who authorized it? Why haven't they been brought to court to explain
their OFFENSIVE ACTION taken against those innocent, unarmed people? Did
you make NO ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER to prosecute the perpetrators of that crime?
Might I remind you that it occurred over a Lincoln County road, which is
under your jurisdiction?

"...On March 26 of this year Norio Hayakawa and Shinichiro Namiki were
stopped by Undersheriff Gary Davis and Deputy Sheriff Doug Lamoreaux, at
which time their camera equipment was 'FORCIBLY CONFISCATED' on public land
by these TWO ARMED MEN. In years gone by this was considered HIGHWAY
ROBBERY. Under what law do you justify such outrage now? or is theft now
legal in Lincoln County?

"Is it not incumbent upon you to at the very least bring Lamoreaux and
Davis up before a judicial hearing in front of an unbiased judge? In case
you've lost their numbers, Mrs. Cafferata, you can reach Undersheriff Davis
at 702-725-3447 and Deputy Sheriff Lamoreaux at 702-725-3645 in their
off-hours when they might be more inclined to give some straightforward
answers about this outrageous behavior.

"I realize that you are at the very least angered by my inquiries. If your
arrogant attitudes towards this reporter is any example of how you slip,
slide, duck and hide from inquiries by others in the Fifth Estate -- you
must hold those of us in the media with very deep disdain. Your attitude
reminds me of Richard Nixon. He had a similar attitude towards the free
press, but you are in good company -- so did Adolph Hitler.

"This country has been very good to me, Mrs. Cafferata. I owe a great debt
to our forefathers who had the courage to stand up and speak out against
tyranny imposed upon them by King George. They had to fight for the freedom
we enjoy in this greatest nation on earth. So I am not about to remain
silent, turn my back and do nothing as you would prefer me to do while I
see our constitutional rights that they FOUGHT and died for twisted and
turned by the knaves of Lincoln County law enforcement.

"I realize that you are paid handsomely to do and say what you do, Mrs.
Cafferata. I have no problem with you making money, just as long as you
don't 'sell out' our freedoms to obtain your fortune. Our freedoms are not
for sale and we are not willing to see you surrender them to some
'Neo-Fascist' NEW WORLD ORDER. I fear that if your belligerent behavior is
allowed to remain UNCHALLENGED in Lincoln County, Nevada may well be on its
way to becoming Nazi-ized.

"I thank God that we still have freedom of speech and expression in this
country. In the Commu-nazi nations of this world I would be investigated
and subject to arrest for daring to make such inquiries of even a tank-town
backwoods bureaucrat. Up until recently in the Soviet 'SLAVE SYSTEM' the
KGB would concoct evidence against individuals like Solzhenitzen who dared
to bring to light the grizzly Hitlerian horrors happening in the Gulag
Archipelago.

"As deeply as you might be in 'COVERING' for those who are 'COVERING UP'
the Nightmares at Nellis, I believe that you will soon discover that the
overwhelming majority of those who receive this letter are far more
dedicated to 'UNCOVERING CRIMES' being committed against American citizens
in your neck of the world -- than you will be in prosecuting crimes
committed in Lincoln County.

"Incidentally, irrespective of how 'new' you might think that President
Bush's NEW WORLD ORDER is, his 'presidential proclamation' is definitely
not new. Adolph Hitler used the exact same words to describe 'his plan' for
Global Government some fifty years ago. Now Bush claims he wants to
accomplish it 'IN A KINDER AND GENTLER WAY.' But that's just on TV -- for
the mindless masses. For your edification THE NEW WORLD ORDER is the title
of Hitler's second book......the first one was MEIN KAMPF. It served the
Fuhrer and his Fascist followers who justified the INHUMAN WRONGS of 'HUMAN
RIGHTS' committed throughout Europe. This included justification for Dr.
Joseph Mengele's monstrous 'MEDIAL EXPERIMENTS' that were performed on the
unsuspecting population in order to develop a MASTER RACE.

"Of course there's a difference between Bush and Hitler's phraseology.
Hitler talked about a THOUSAND-YEAR REICH. Bush talks about a THOUSAND
POINTS OF LIGHT.

"I know that it shatters your senses for someone like myself to suggest
that 'GENETIC ENGINEERING' and 'MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS' could be going on in
the miles of tunneled underground facilities at S-4 and Groom Lake -- and
that history could be repeating itself, yet this topic has come up
repeatedly over the past year -- from 'several sources'.

"I recall one case in point when the Lincoln County Sheriff's Department
picked up a young black woman named Trassie Wingfield who was wandering
about in the Tickaboo Valley one night near the perimeter of the base. As I
understand it she's in the Navy and is stationed out of Hawaii. She claimed
to have been abducted and brought to 'the facility' twice for 'medical
experiments'. Did your office investigate her charges? And if not, why not?

"According to the FBI and Department of Justice records, well over 300,000
children end up MISSING AND UNACCOUNTED FOR in this country every year.
Where do you think these 'MILK CARTON KIDS' disappear to, Mrs. Cafferata?
Certainly they can't all get swallowed up in the inner cities or wind up in
shallow graves off lonely backwoods roads or served up on the table of some
psychopathic cannibal.

"In Bill Hamilton's book 'COSMIC TOP SECRET' there may be an answer to this
question. In it is described a literal Hitlerian 'hell under the earth'
which was created at a TOP SECRET- BLACK PROJECT base called Dulce. That
one is located in New Mexico, not far from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. I have enclosed two pages from Hamilton's book for your review.
Though I suspect you will -- I pray that you don't -- take these murderous
matters lightly.

"I have recently heard stories of people who, under hypnosis, have
described in nightmarish terms what goes on in these God-forsaken
underground facilities like DREAMLAND. Based upon what I have heard, I can
only describe the 'HELL-HOLES' as 'FRANKENSTEIN FACTORIES'. According to my
sources, these laboratories are run by a small army of I.G.O.R.S. (the
Invisible GOvernment's RobotonS) who follow 'the party line' as did their
Nazi predecessors who ran the Hitlerian Hospitals at Auschwitz and Dachau.

"I don't know what Hitlerian horrors are happening out there with PROJECT
REDLIGHT but I feel it's imperative to ask the Attorney General of the
State of Nevada to appoint a special (independent, non-government)
investigative team to uncover just what kind of 'experimentation' is going
on in the underground facilities at S-4 and Groom Lake (if these biogenetic
experiments are taking place in United States territory, should not they be
subject to the same Federal regulations that all of the other Medical
Institutions are subject to? - Branton). The country has the right to know
if the missing 'MILK CARTON KIDS' are being used for 'genetic engineering'
and if adult 'abductees' are used for mutation experiments and body parts.

"I would think that if you refuse to cooperate with such an investigative
team or to even address this issue -- one might conclude that you, like
your predecessors, are following close to 'the party line'.

"A final question about 'THE FINAL SOLUTION', Mrs. Cafferata. As you know,
Adolph Hitler was reported to have ordered HIS I.G.O.R.S. to gas millions
of innocents in 'death camps' like Auschwitz and Dachau 'TO CLEANSE' the
world of the Jewish problem. Did you ever ask yourself what happened to
those atomic scientists in Germany who were developing the A-Bomb and the
dozens of doctors who conducted those medical experiments on human beings?
Is it merely coincidental that there exists many thousands of Malthusian
Minded Men who openly accept 'MASS MURDER' as necessary to bring about a
NEW WORLD ORDER? These Orwellian ONE WORLDERS working within the Bush
'Black Projects' believe that the world's population has to be reduced by
1,2500,000,000 people by the year 2000 (25%). If you don't believe, there
are madmen with this mind-set... Read GLOBAL 2000's MASTER PLAN.

"These Malthusian men have the minds of monsters. They use 'controlled
conflicts' (war), 'bacteriological warfare' (AIDS), sterilization,
mandatory abortion and 'weather modification' to create droughts that
result in mass starvation. To achieve their 'end objective' for global
government upon the ashes of all national-sovereignty they are willing to
mass-murder millions. That requires, of course, the 'cooperation' of
officials like you, Mrs. Cafferata, to follow 'the party line'.

"I know it's very hard for you to accept, even in your wildest thoughts,
that an AMERICAN AUSCHWITZ could exist UNDER American soil. I bet it's even
harder for you to conceive that it could be fully functioning in Lincoln
County. Are you willing to testify in a court of law that it doesn't exist
there, Mrs. Cafferata?
