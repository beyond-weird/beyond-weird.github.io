ABDUCTION EXPERIENCE CLASSIFICATIONS



By : Richard D. Butler



The following is a brief description of the most commonly
reported abduction experience types. 

It is intended to provide a standard of classification in
abduction research.



[AE-1] LUCID DREAM

This is a lucid dream experience generated internally by the
subjectUs subconscious. There is no Human/ET  interaction at any
level. They are usually grandiose in nature and lack a logical
progression.



[AE-2] TECHNO/TELEPATHIC  LUCID DREAM

This is a lucid dream experience, internally generated by
external forces. It is ET in origin and accomplished by
technologically enhanced psychic intrusion of the subjectUs
subconscious. The subject reports the disassociation ,or collapse
of, a normal dream and the insertion of a scenario or message
which enhances certain ideals or beliefs. If the subject awakens
immediately after, they report a circle of glowing whitish
colored energy on the ceiling, approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter, with a
shaft of the same energy slowly retracting back into the
circle. This shaft is approximately 3 to 6 inches in diameter and 2.5 to 4 feet
long. 



[AE-3] PSY/BIO ENERGY FIELD EXTRACTION

This experience involves the extraction of a conscious energy
field from the subjectUs body. It should not be confused with
naturally occurring OOBE phenomena, as separation is externally
induced. The technology employs the use of a white or
bluish-white colored extraction beam. Subjects describe a
feeling of deep penetration of this beam throughout their body,
followed by the sensation of an irresistible or attractive
force. The extracted field maintains cohesion, and is capable of
perceiving stimuli at a greatly enhanced level. Perceptions
include 360 degree sight and sensory feedback at the molecular,
and even atomic level. Experiences seem to focus around
communications and reinsertion of the bio-field into a humanoid
body other than the original. It is this type of abduction that
accounts for the severe missing time memory failure in some
cases.

Since the subjectUs brain is not physically present, the memories
are not hard-written. There does appear to be a shadow memory
effect that can retain the memories of the events in some type
of energy memory matrix, within the subjects bio-field. Full
understanding of this process could lead to breakthroughs in
education and learning technologies.



[AE-4] PHYSICAL ABDUCTION

This is the physical removal of a subject from their environment
to an ET environment. The subject is first tranquilized to
reduce possible injury to either side. These abductions follow a
very strict military-like protocol. Subjects are transported via
a small shuttle, lifting beam or  direct transfer. Direct
transfer utilizes a hyper-dimensional tunnel. It will appear as
a large brilliant white energy gate. The subject steps through
the gate and is instantly aboard the craft. Also reported is the
nullification of the nuclear repulsive forces in solid objects.
This allows the subject to physically pass through solid
objects. Once onboard, the person is subjected to various
physical tests and procedures. The main thrust is in the genetic
experimentation area. Reports of sperm and ovum extraction are
quite common. After these procedures are performed, the subject
is returned unharmed, to their original location. A screen memory
is then inserted into the subjectUs subconscious. This slightly
shifts the reality recalled by the abductee but never erases the
event entirely. This distinguishes them from [AE-3]. 



[AE-5] PAST LIFE RECALL

These experiences are the least reported and the most
interesting, in terms of their implications. They appear to
represent events in the experience of an ET life form. Subjects
relate being in an underground military facility, sometimes on
Mars, the Moon and even under the Earth's oceans.

Memories of being onboard a spacecraft and other ET environments
are also recalled. What is so interesting is that the subject
views this, not from an Earth human perspective, but from that of
an ET. This suggests two very interesting possibilities. 
A.) During telepathic communication some memories are subconsciously
transferred. 
B.) The subject is recalling actual past life
memories of their own. This second possibility opens the door to
much speculation. It suggests that part of the abduction
phenomena may be a, massive and covert, reconnaissance operation.
It may also explain why the Greys have said they have the right
to do what they do. If abductees are souls that have been
transferred from the ET environment to Earth, then technically
they are not abducting human beings but volunteer ETs.
