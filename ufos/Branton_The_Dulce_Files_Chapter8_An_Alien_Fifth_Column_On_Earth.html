AN ALIEN FIFTH COLUMN ON EARTH?





The mysterious "government insider" whose books have been published by Tim
Beckley's Abelard Press of New York, "Commander X," related a very
interesting incident which involved the subterranean mega-complex beneath
Dulce, New Mexico:



"...In another case an old illustrator, John D., does very painstaking
work, but during his being on active duty at Dulce he began to act very
queerly. He would write letters to the President informing him of a plot
underway to undermine the government, and to sabotage the base. He began to
draw pictures of American flags, beautifully executed. He drew strange
designs of mechanical devices, began to visit the library and bring back
books on physics and advanced electronics. He hardly knew how to spell the
words.

"He would patiently explain something of a very technical nature which he
shouldn't have understood. When asked what he was raving about and why he
was causing trouble by writing the President, John D. would say that he had
been 'sensitized.'

"'Last year when I was sick [John D. explained], the doctor on the base
gave me sulfanilamide. There is a fifth column in this country that is tied
up with aliens. Selenium is being slipped into SULFA DRUGS, and this
selenium lodges in the bones and makes the body receptive to extremely
short waves, those in the wave band of the brain. Similar to the waves that
can be detected by the encephalograph. About 300,000 people in this country
have been sensitized, and at least seven secret radio stations have been
set up in this country, and they are broadcasting to these sensitized
persons, instructing them in the best way to perform acts of sabotage
against our planet.'"



These claims as given by the Dulce worker, John D., are incredible indeed,
and could easily be dismissed as the ravings of a madman, IF NOT FOR THE
FACT that many others are saying basically the same thing, that there is a
movement underway to bring the minds of the masses under the subjection of
an alien force, whether through electronic implantation and control,
subliminal programming, or through other means.

Why would the 'controllers' use the United States as the major target of
their activity? We believe that this is due to the fact that the United
States is a place that was originally intended by it's 'founding fathers'
to be a refuge for peoples FROM ALL NATIONS to come and work out their
collective destinies free from the restrictions of prejudice and the
oppressiveness of tyrannical rule -- a land where all people could express
their creativity, culture and individual destinies without interference.
This was their 'intention', however it is obvious that the 'dream' has not
been fully realized because of collective and governmental compromise of
the principle that "all men are created equal". The United States,
nevertheless, is unlike any other single nation. It is a cultural "melting
pot" and a place where not only international human societies on the
surface CONVERGE and intermingle in a dramatic way, but apparently where
human societies beneath or beyond the earth converge as well. For instance,
according to various reports, most non-surface human societies who are
aware of planet earth have their representatives walking among us in our
own society [and to some extent, other nations throughout the world],
although many of these choose to keep a low profile for either honorable or
not-so-honorable reasons. Another factor is the respect which the BILL OF
RIGHTS gives to all American citizens, allowing for personal freedom and
individuality so long as the freedom and individuality of others is not
threatened. Individuality is the MORTAL ENEMY of the alien "Hive", you
could say.

The U.S., then, seems to be in essence a "World Scenario", if not a
'universal' scenario in miniature and therefore the 'Conspiracy' sees it as
a most valuable prize. Therefore it would probably not be too 'far out' to
suggest that the war between the human and serpent races from all three
'realms' [extraterrestrial, ultraterrestrial and intra-terrestrial]
CONVERGE within the United States, and to be more exact, within the
vicinities of the Archuleta plateau near Dulce, New Mexico [a MAJOR
earth-base of the Reptiloid interventionist Empire forces]; the Death
Valley region of California [a MAJOR earth-base of the Humanoid
non-interventionist Federation forces]; and then we have the
'battle-grounds' between the AMERICAN-COM12-CABAL-PHILADELPHIAN-NORDIC and
the BAVARIAN-AQUARIUS-MAJI-PHOENICIAN-REPTILOID forces within high-security
military complexes like those which permeate the underground territories
below California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma and New
Mexico... and apparently centered specifically in or near the underground
military-industrial systems beneath Lancaster, California; Mercury, Nevada;
Burley, Idaho; Dougway, Utah; Page, Arizona; the underground systems below
the Denver International Airport of Colorado; and also below Oklahoma City.
All of these basing areas are seen by the proponents of the New World Order
as strategic sites that they MUST maintain control of if they are to force
America to submit to a one-world government.
