CONDUCTED IF AN INDIVIDUAL CHANGES DUTY

POSITIONS AND IS CERTIFIED BY HIS SUPERVISOR FOR THE NEW POSITION. THE QC
EVALUATION WILL CONSIST OF A THREE

PHASE EVALUATION: ORAL, WRITTEN AND PRACTICAL. A MINIMUM OF SCORE OF 70%
FOR THE ORAL, 70% FOR THE WRITTEN

AND 80% FOR THE PRACTICAL HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR ALL POSITIONS EXCEPT FOR
THE SECURITY CONTROLLER, A

SCORE OF 80% OVER ALL AREAS IS REQUIRED. ALL POSITIONS WILL TAKE A
WEAPONS/USE OF FORCE TEST WHICH IS

CORRECTABLE TO 100%.

SECURITY CATEGORIES

SECURITY CATEGORIES ARE DIFFERENT POSTURES OF SECURITY REQUIRED TO MEET
SECURITY OBJECTIVES OF

DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS. THE POSTURES MAY EFFECT SITE OPERATIONS INVOLVING
NON-PERMANENT PERSONNEL NOT

CLEARED ON THAT PROGRAM. THE CATEGORIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

CATEGORY 1: THIS IS THE SECURITY POSTURE DURING NON-DUTY HOURS WHEN PROGRAM
ACTIVITIES ARE NOT IN OPERATION

AND THE MAJORITY OF THE BASE POPULACE HAS COMPLETED DUTY FOR THE DAY.

CATEGORY 2: THIS IS THE SECURITY POSTURE DURING NORMAL DUTY HOURS WHEN
PROGRAM ASSESTS ARE NOT EXPOSED

AND THE MAJORITY OF THE BASE POPULACE IS PRESENT FOR DUTY.

CATEGORY 3: THIS IS AN INCREASED SECURITY POSTURE REQUIRED FOR DEPARTMENTAL
PROGRAMS. THE LETTER

DESIGNATORS FOLLOWING THE NUMBER '3' WILL IDENTIFY THE PROGRAM AS
IDENTIFIED IN DET 3 REG 125-2. THIS CATEGORY

WILL BE IN EFFECT WHENEVER DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAM ASSESTS ARE EXPOSED ON THE
GROUND AND INADVERTENT

EXPOSURE TO NON-CLEARED PERSONNEL IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE. NON-PERMANENT
PERSONNEL NOT CLEARED FOR THAT

PROGRAM WILL BE SEQUESTERED.

CATEGORY 4: THIS INCREASED SECURITY POSTURE IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS
CATEGORY 3, EXCEPT DEPARTMENTAL

PROGRAM ASSESTS ARE EXPOSED IN OPERATION AND INADVERTENT EXPOSURE TO
NON-CLEARED PERSONNEL IS

PROBABLE. NON-PERMANENT PERSONNEL NOT CLEARED FOR THAT PROGRAM WILL BE
SEQUESTERED.

CATEGORY 3/4 WITH NIGHT TIME DEVIATIONS

DURING NIGHT HOURS, APPROVED PROGRAM PERSONNEL MAY IMPLEMENT CATEGORY 3
THROUGH SECURITY WHEN TEO IS

NOT MANNING THE CURRENT OPERATIONS CENTER (WHITE ROOM). HOWEVER, A NIGHT
TIME CATEGORY 3 IMPLEMENTED BY

THE PROGRAM PERSONNEL IN THIS MANNER MUST TERMINATE THE CATEGORY 30 MINUTES
PRIOR TO SUNRISE, UNLESS TEO

CURRENT OPERATIONS (WHITE ROOM) IS MANNED AND OPERATING.

STANDARD DEVIATIONS: APPROVED PROGRAM PERSONNEL MAY REQUEST OR APPROVE A
STANDARD DEVIATION TO

CATEGORY 3. THE STANDARD DEVIATION ALLOWS NON PERMANENT PERSONNEL NOT
CLEARED ON THAT PROGRAM TO MOVE

WITHIN THE MAIN BASE AREA WITHOUT SEQUESTERING. OTHER VISITOR CONTROL AND
ESCORT PROCEDURES STILL APPLY.

FIELD SENSOR GUIDE

THE FIELD SENSOR IMPLANTED THROUGHOUT THE RANGES ARE ELECTRONICAL SENSORS
WHICH ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A

VEHICLE ENTERING OR EXITING THE INSTALLATION BY OTHER THAN
APPROVED/AUTHORIZED ENTRY POINTS.

A. CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENSOR: THE SENSOR SYSTEM INCORPORATES A CANISTER
WHICH HOUSES THE 'BRAIN' OF THE

SENSOR, TWO (2) PROBES FOR RECEIVING INBOUND/OUTBOUND SIGNALS, THE ANTENNA
AND A BATTERY PACK FOR POWER.

B. OPERATION OF THE SENSOR: WHEN PROPERLY PLACED IN THE GROUND A VEHICLE
PASSES THE FIRST PROBE INDICATING

WHETHER LEAVING OR ENTERING THE AREA. THIS SIGNAL IS THEN SENT VIA THE
ANTENNA TO (IN SOME CASES A REPEATER)

THE SMS IN CSC WHICH DECIPHERS THE SIGNAL AND DISPLAYS IT ON THE COLOR
MONITOR AND THE VT220 SCREEN.

NOTE #1: THE PROBES SHOULD BE BURIED/COVERED COMPLETELY WITH DIRT AND THE
FLAT END FACING THE ROADWAY.

NOTE #2: THE ANTENNA IS NORMALLY MOUNTED TO THE CANISTER BUT IT CAN BE
MOUNTED TO A STAKE FOR BETTER

TRANSMITTING CAPABILITIES.

C. PATROL PROCEDURES: WHEN A PATROL IS DISPATCHED TO A SENSOR TO DISCONNECT
IT DUE TO NUMEROUS ALARMS,

THEY WILL DISCONNECT THE BATTERY SUPPLY FROM THE BATTERY. IF YOU DISCONNECT
IT FROM THE CANISTER (J5+12V

INPUT) INSURE YOU REPLACE THE PROTECTIVE CAP ON THE 'J5' CONNECTOR. DO NOT
DISCONNECT ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS

TOLD BY THE SENSOR SECTION PERSONNEL.

NOTE #1: IF A PROBE IS LAYING SIDEWAYS, REPOSITION IT SO THE FLAT SIDE IS
FACING THE ROADWAY.

NOTE #2: IF ANY OF THE CABLES ARE CHEWED UP OR MANGLED, NOTIFY THE SENSOR
SECTION PERSONNEL (IN PERSON,

ANNOTATION ON THE ACTIVITY LOG OR LEAVE A NOTE).

D. IDENTIFYING THE SENSOR: CURRENTLY AS YOU APPROACH THE GENERAL AREA OF A
SENSOR THERE SHOULD BE A STAKE

PAINTED WITH ORANGE PAINT ON ONE SIDE. WITHIN 20 FEET OF THAT STAKE YOU
SHOULD FIND THE SENSOR.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

MOVEMENT OF TEST ARTICLES

1. This Standard Operating Procedure is intended to describe instructions
for the safe and secure transportation of the test articles by members

of the USAFO Test Force. It is further intended to provide information to
those site organizations involved in support of the USAFO (TEG).

2. The test articles are assembled in building 735, and then transported to
either the munitions storage area, or directly to the Weapons Test

Range (WTR) launch area.

3. The test articles will be transported on a missile pallet that is bolted
to a pallet trailer. The articles will be towed behind a truck with a
pindle

hook hitch. This vehicle will be escorted by two (2) other vehicles in a
convoy. The vehicles will consist of a security vehicle in the lead, with

emergency flashers on, and one member of the USAFO Test Force aboard. The
prime mover, towing the test articles, will be 50 meters behind

the first vehicle and will be driven by a member of the USAFO Test Force.
The last vehicle following the prime mover by 50 meters will be a

security vehicle with emergency flashers on and one member of the USAFO
Test Force aboard. This convoy will be used for the transportation

of test articles to all destinations.

4. The speed of the convoy will be no more than 15mph on the main base
area, and 30mph on the road to the WTR. The lead security vehicle

will be responsible to insure that the convoy speed limits are adhered to.
