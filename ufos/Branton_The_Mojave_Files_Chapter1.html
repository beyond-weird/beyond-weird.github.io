                     "AND SIGNS IN THE EARTH BENEATH...
                 "BLOOD, AND FIRE, AND VAPOUR OF SMOKE..."
                              -- Acts 2:19 --

The author of the following story is a Navaho Indian. He revealed this
tribal secret which he learned from the Paiute Indians, who inhabit the
Great Basin and Mojave deserts of Utah, Nevada, and California.

This native American, who went by the name Oga-Make, related the following
account in appreciation for a story on the Navaho which appeared in the
Spring of 1948 in a magazine which was carrying numerous articles on the
mysterious "signs" or "fires" in the skies which were causing an enormous
amount of confusion and debate during that same year, as well as the years
following.

The article on the Navaho nation, which appeared in an earlier issue, told
of the suffering that their tribe had gone through during past winter
seasons, and encouraged the readership to send goods and supplies to help
them through the upcoming winter of '48-'49, which many of them did.

In appreciation of this, Oga-Make related the following 'legend' which told
of the secret history of the Americas which ran it's course, possibly
thousands of years before white men set their foot en masse upon it's
shores:

"...Most of you who read this are probably white men of a blood only a
century or two out of Europe. You speak in your papers of the Flying
Saucers or Mystery Ships as something new, and strangely typical of the
twentieth century. How could you but think otherwise? Yet if you had red
skin, and were of a blood which had been born and bred of the land for
untold thousands of years, you would know this is not true. You would know
that your ancestors living in these mountains and upon these prairies for
numberless generations, had seen these ships before, and had passed down
the story in the legends which are the unwritten history of your people.
You do not believe? Well, after all, why should you? But knowing your
scornful unbelief, the storytellers of my people have closed their lips in
bitterness against the outward flow of this knowledge.

"Yet, I have said to the storytellers this: now that the ships are being
seen again, is it wise that we, the elder race, keep our knowledge to
ourselves? Thus for me, an American Indian, some of the sages among my
people have talked, and if you care to, I shall permit you to sit down with
us and listen.

"Let us say that it is dusk in that strange place which you, the white-man,
calls 'Death Valley.' I have passed tobacco...to the aged chief of the
Paiutes who sits across a tiny fire from me and sprinkles corn meal upon
the flames...

"The old chief looked like a wrinkled mummy as he sat there puffing upon
his pipe. Yet his eyes were not those of the unseeing, but eyes which
seemed to look back on long trails of time. His people had held the Inyo,
Panamint and Death Valleys for untold centuries before the coming of the
white-man. Now we sat in the valley which white-man named for Death, but
which the Paiute calls Tomesha--The Flaming Land. Here before me as I faced
eastward, the Funerals (mountains forming Death Valley's eastern wall) were
wrapped in purple-blue blankets about their feet while their faces were
painted in scarlet. Behind me, the Panamints rose like a mile-high wall,
dark against the sinking sun.

"The old Paiute smoked my tobacco for a long time before he reverently blew
the smoke to the four directions. Finally he spoke.

"'You ask me if we heard of the great silver airships in the days before
white-man brought his wagon trains into the land?'

"'Yes grandfather, I come seeking knowledge.' (Among all tribes of my
people, grandfather is the term of greatest respect which one man can pay
to another.)

"'We, the Paiute Nation, have known of these ships for untold generations.
We also believe that we know something of the people who fly them. They are
called The Hav-musuvs.'

"'Who are the Hav-musuvs?'

"'They are a people of the Panamints, and they are as ancient as Tomesha
itself.'

"He smiled a little at my confusion.

"'You do not understand? Of course not. You are not a Paiute. Then listen
closely and I will lead you back along the trail of the dim past.

"'When the world was young, and this valley which is now dry, parched
desert, was a lush, hidden harbor of a blue water- sea which stretched from
half way up those mountains to the Gulf of California, it is said that the
Hav-musuvs came here in huge rowing-ships. They found great caverns in the
Panamints, and in them they built one of their cities. At that time
California was the island which the Indians of that state told the Spanish
it was, and which they marked so on their maps.

"'Living in their hidden city, the Hav-musuvs ruled the sea with their fast
rowing-ships, trading with far-away peoples and bringing strange goods to
the great quays said still to exist in the caverns.

"'Then as untold centuries rolled past, the climate began to change. The
water in the lake went down until there was no longer a way to the sea.
First the way was broken only by the southern mountains, over the tops of
which goods could be carried. But as time went by, the water continued to
shrink, until the day came when only a dry crust was all that remained of
the great blue lake. Then the desert came, and the Fire-God began to walk
across Tomesha, The Flaming-Land.

"'When the Hav-musuvs could no longer use their great rowing-ships, they
began to think of other means to reach the world beyond. I suppose that is
how it happened. We know that they began to use flying canoes. At first
they were not large, these silvery ships with wings. They moved with a
slight whirring sound, and a dipping movement, like an eagle.

"'The passing centuries brought other changes. Tribe after tribe swept
across the land, fighting to possess it for awhile and passing like the
storm of sand. In their mountain city still in the caverns, the Hav-musuvs
dwelt in peace, far removed from the conflict. Sometimes they were seen in
the distance, in their flying ships or riding on the snowy-white animals
which took them from ledge to ledge up the cliffs. We have never seen these
strange animals at any other place. To these people the passing centuries
brought only larger and larger ships, moving always more silently.'

"'Have you ever seen a Hav-musuv?'

"'No, but we have many stories of them. There are reasons why one does not
become too curious.'

"'Reasons?'

"'Yes. These strange people have weapons. One is a small tube which stuns
one with a prickly feeling like a rain of cactus needles. One cannot move
for hours, and during this time the mysterious ones vanish up the cliffs.
The other weapon is deadly. It is a long, silvery tube. When this is
pointed at you, death follows immediately.'

"'But tell me about these people. What do they look like and how do they
dress?'

"'They are a beautiful people. Their skin is a golden tint, and a head band
holds back their long dark hair. They dress always in a white fine-spun
garment which wraps around them and is draped upon one shoulder. Pale
sandals are worn upon their feet...'

"His voice trailed away in a puff of smoke. The purple shadows rising up
the walls of the Funerals splashed like the waves of the ghost lake. The
old man seemed to have fallen into a sort of trance, but I had one more
question.

"'Has any Paiute ever spoken to a Hav-musuv, or were the Paiutes here when
the great rowing-ships first appeared?'

"For some moments I wondered if he had heard me. Yet as is our custom, I
waited patiently for the answer. Again he went through the ritual of the
smoke-breathing to the four directions, and then his soft voice continued:

"'Yes. Once in the not-so-distant-past, but yet many generations before the
coming of the Spanish, a Paiute chief lost his bride by sudden death. In
his great and overwhelming grief, he thought of the Hav-musuvs and their
long tube-of-death. He wished to join her, so he bid farewell to his
sorrowing people and set off to find the Hav-musuvs. None appeared until
the chief began to climb the almost unscaleable Panamints. Then one of the
men in white appeared suddenly before him with the long tube, and motioned
him back. The chief made signs that he wished to die, and came on. The man
in white made a long singing whistle and other Hav-musuvs appeared. They
spoke together in a strange tongue and then regarded the chief thought-
fully. Finally they made signs to him making him understand that they would
take him with them.

"'Many weeks after his people had mourned him for dead, the Paiute chief
came back to his camp. He had been in the giant underground valley of the
Hav-musuvs, he said, where white lights which burn night and day and never
go out, or need any fuel, lit an ancient city of marble beauty. There he
learned the language and the history of the mysterious people, giving them
in turn the language and legends of the Paiutes. He said that he would have
liked to remain there forever in the peace and beauty of their life, but
they bade him return and use his new knowledge for his people.'

"I could not help but ask the inevitable.

"'Do you believe this story of the chief?'

"His eyes studied the wisps of smoke for some minutes before he answered.

"'I do not know. When a man is lost in Tomesha, and the Fire-God is walking
across the salt crust, strange dreams like clouds, fog through his mind. No
man can breathe the hot breath of the Fire-God and long remain sane. Of
course, the Paiutes have thought of this. No people knows the moods of
Tomesha better than they.

"'You asked me to tell you the legend of the flying ships. I have told you
what the young men of the tribe do not know, for they no longer listen to
the stories of the past. Now you ask me if I believe. I answer this. Turn
around. Look behind you at that wall of the Panamints. How many giant
caverns could open there, being hidden by the lights and shadows of the
rocks? How many could open outward or inward and never be seen behind the
arrow-like pinnacles before them? How many ships could swoop down like an
eagle from the beyond, on summer nights when the fires of the furnace-sands
have closed away the valley from the eyes of the white-man? How many
Hav-musuvs could live in their eternal peace away from the noise of
white-man's guns in their unscaleable stronghold? This has always been a
land of mystery. Nothing can change that. Not even white-man with his
flying engines, for should they come too close to the wall of the Panamints
a sharp wind like the flying arrow can sheer off a wing. Tomesha hides its
secrets well even in winter, but no man can pry into them when the Fire-God
draws the hot veil of his breath across the passes.

"'I must still answer your question with my mind in doubt, for we speak of
a weird land. White-man does not yet know it as well as the Paiutes, and we
have ever held it in awe. It is still the forbidden
'Tomesha--Land-Of-The-Flaming-Earth.'"

The preceding account, titled "TRIBAL MEMORIES OF THE FLYING SAUCERS",
appeared in the Sept. 1949 issue of FATE magazine. Coincidentally or not,
this same 'legend' was repeated in amazing similarity by an old prospector
by the name of Bourke Lee in his book "DEATH VALLEY MEN" (Macmillan Co.,
New York, 1932). However, Lee stated that it was NOT a legend, but an
actual account of the discovery of a (now abandoned) city WITHIN the
Panamint Mountains as he heard it from three other people who claimed to
have seen this ancient wonder beneath the earth.

Believe it or not, those who talked to Bourke Lee mentioned the ancient
'lake' within Death Valley, the ancient city within the Panamints
themselves, and even the large tunnel-like 'quays' or ancient boat docks
above the ancient shoreline on the eastern slope of the Panamints which led
INTO the ancient city... ancient artifacts which they swore they saw with
their own eyes.

The Editors of FATE magazine introduced the story which appears above with
the following words:

"...FATE presents two new saucer stories in this issue. The first is a
startling account of an aviation editor's encounter with two disks (two
week's after he had photographed four and was frustrated in every attempt
to get the photo into the big dailies and thus prove the flying saucers
were real at the height of the 'scare'); and the second is a tribal secret
of the Paihute Indians given to FATE magazine out of appreciation for
FATE's Navaho story in the Spring, 1948 issue, which helped relieve their
hardship in the ensuing winter. Your editor wonders about (these) stories,
and presents them as a possible solution of the nature and origin of the
famous disks. Both these stories arrived on our desk on the same day. They
corroborate each other. We say that investigation will prove both to be
true. We admit, however, that we believe it will be as impossible to prove
the Hav-musuv story as it has been to produce a captive disk. Your editor,
however, has been a friend of the American Indian for many years, and he
has rarely known an Indian to lie. He is convinced of the sincerity of the
story we present in this issue, and that it has not been distorted. What
does it mean? What, really, are the Hav-musuvs?"

The story of the Hav-musuvs seems to be a major or key 'piece' of the
overall puzzle of a wide range of aerial as well as subsurface phenomena
which have mystified numerous researchers throughout this century.

Not the least of these unusual phenomena were the so-called 'contactees' of
California who during the 1950's and '60's, in fact, described their own
alleged encounters with 'benevolent' human-like beings who were seen to
emerge from aerial disks, not far at all from the mysterious Panamint
mountains them- selves.

The Mojave Desert is also, believe it or not, the very place where William
Shatner claimed to have had his UFO encounter with a 'silvery disk', which
he alleges saved his life after he became lost in the Mojave's
other-worldly expanse, and this long before he was Christened 'Captain' of
the U.S.S. Enterprise!

The Mojave Desert of California is in this sense perhaps one of the most
interesting areas in the world whereas encounters with strange aerial
phenomena are concerned. In certain small California and Mojave Desert
towns, like the small town of Anza for instance, one is more likely to be
called crazy for NOT believing in UFO's than they are for believing in
them. Sightings have been so numerous over the years that these aerial
visitors are an accepted fact of life.

The interesting thing, however, is that the two most commonly reported
types of 'occupants' which are described by thousands of witnesses with
remarkable consistency the world over (in relation to these aerial
phenomena) play a large part in the Mojave Desert scenario as well. These
are the two groups which have often been referred to at the 'Saurian Grays'
and the 'Nordic Blonds'.

Both types of 'entities' have appeared in many accounts describing
encounters with not only so-called extraterrestrial beings, but also the
lesser known -- although nevertheless persistent -- accounts of
intra-terranean beings as well. In this file we will document numerous
accounts which seem to suggest that the 'Nordics' may be our ancient
ancestors who, a few thousand years previous to the modern 'space race',
may have attained the science and technology necessary to burrow deep into
the earth in order to construct vast subterranean tech- nological
metropolises, and shortly thereafter like a slingshot from the lower depths
of the earth they may have hurled them- selves in starships of their own
devising through the interplanetary and perhaps even interstellar depths of
space.

The strange allegation among 'UFOlogists', however, is one mentioned by
many 'contactees' who allege that a neo-sauroid or reptilian race known as
the GRAYS may have for hundreds if not thousands of years been in conflict,
or even in even all-out warfare with the so-called 'Nordics' (as we will
see further on, the "Nordic" appellation may be closer to the truth than
one might think). The explanation given by some researchers as to the
ACTUAL ORIGIN of this malevolent and predatory (other) race of 'grayish'
aliens may shock you!

Since National Polls reveal that approximately 80 percent of all Americans
believe in the phenomena known as UFO's to some degree, and that as many as
2 percent or 1 in 50 believe that they have been targets of 'abduction' by
the same in the past, this file is written with the assumption that the
reader is one of the 80% (and possibly even one of the 2 percent who have
experiential knowledge of the UFO phenomena).

If the reader believes that they are part of the 20 percent who do not
believe in UFO's and have no desire to do so, then the following may not be
for you. If one does not like the idea of having the very 'fabric' of their
concept of reality torn apart and woven back together again, then they
might do well to pass on this information to someone with a more open mind.
But if you desire to bear with us, we will reveal to you the hidden secrets
of one place on earth which appears to be a 'doorway' to other worlds, to
worlds and realities and adventures which may well make the reader's own
perception of 'reality' seem absolutely mundane to the extreme...

But if you dare, then read on:

George H. Leonard, in his book "SOMEBODY ELSE IS ON THE MOON" (David McKay
Co. Inc., New York., 1967), quotes Morris K. Jessup (the UFOlogist who died
under mysterious circumstances after exposing the so-called 'PHILADELPHIA
EXPERIMENT'), who asked the question: "Who has beaten us to the moon by
hundreds or even thousands of years?"

Leonard, based on research gathered by himself and certain ex-NASA
employees, confirms the suspicions of certain researchers to the effect
that NASA is aware of the fact that an alien race (the Grays, etc.) AND a
human-like race has for centuries been fighting for possession of the moon,
that mining equipment has been seen as well as many other evidences of
lunar activity. Leonard says:

"More than one...race occupies the Moon - Culture traits and technology
seen in different parts of the Moon vary considerably ... it appears from
the body of reliable data that one or more of the (non-human) races regards
us with disdain and values human life cheaply... Races capable of moving
between star systems... and existing on the Moon must be capable of wiping
us out at will. It is probably this (understandably) which PANICS the
military."

Mr. Leonard, during one of his interviews with an ex-NASA employee whom he
refers to as Dr. Sam Wittcomb (a pseudonym to protect his real identity),
at which time he showed 'Whittcomb' the ms. for his book, learned the
following disturbing facts:

"...And Sam Wittcomb read my manuscript in draft and then sat staring into
the black night. When he spoke, it was in a hushed voice. I'd never heard
him like that before. 'They brought scientists together from many countries
in the Spring of 1975. The meeting was in England. They wanted to talk on
the quiet about "extraterrestrials" and what they're up to. A lot of people
at the top are scared.' A cold spot formed in the small of my back. Sam
turned to me. 'They invited a physicist from Colorado, a man named Joachim
Kuetner, who'd worked on the Moon program and know's what's up there. He
could tell them about it first hand. About the frenetic building and
digging going on, the spraying of craters and carving up of crater rims and
ridges. I don't know exactly what they talked about. But you can bet they
know it's not Earth-people's Moon anymore -- if it ever was. It belongs to
THEM.'"

As we've said, at least one of the races on the Moon is human, or identical
to those of us on earth. If this is so, then we might ask ourselves "where
on earth did these people come from, and how did they get to the moon
before 'we' did?" It is certainly a reasonable question.

There exist several corroborative accounts taken from ancient Hindu scripts
(again, as Ripley would say "believe it or not"), which we will quote
shortly, stating that the ancient GREEKS had actually developed flying
ships thousands of years ago. Is it possible that the Hav-musuvs (which as
we've said, may have been a neo-Grecian race because of their dress and
their marble- like cities) would have taken the next logical step after
developing aerial travel: that is, attempt to land one or more of their
kind on the Moon... eventually upon Mars... and possibly even later upon
planets in a nearby star system?

The United States has made incredible advances in this area in a period of
less than 100 years, thanks to the phenomena known as the technological
curve (i.e. that a synchronous effort on the part of many contributing
factors eventually leads to a multiplying explosion in technology). If
America landed a man on the moon only 70 years after the Wright Brothers
opened the skies to aerial travel, then can we expect anything less from
the Hav-musuvs or others like them? For instance technology in our society
is becoming thousands of times more sophisticated every year. Is it
possible that the ancient Greeks or a similar ancient society had a
'technology explosion' thousands of years ago? If so, then it may have been
possible for them to establish bases or colonies on the Moon, Mars, and
perhaps beyond! We might add that there are some who even claim that the
secret of "hyper- space" travel was inadvertently discovered only 40 years
after the Wright Brothers successfully tested their aircraft at Kitty Hawk
- during a super-secret Navy experiment called the Rainbow Project which
was carried out at the Philadelphia Naval harbor in 1943.

If 'we' can go from the horse-and-buggy to landing men on the moon in LESS
that 100 years (or from the horse-and-buggy to "hyperspace" travel in only
40 years!?) then how much exploration and colonization of other planetary
bodies might have taken place by a race who three or four THOUSAND years
ago possessed aerial craft and technologies equal to or greater than our
own?

One 'contactee', incidentally, has stated that a large 'space port' does in
fact exist in a network of caverns deep below present-day Death Valley.

In reference to this we will quote from a 'synopsis' of the experiences of
Brazilian 'contactee' Jefferson Souza, as it appeared in a catalog put out
by the UFO LIBRARY (11684 Ventura Blvd. #708., Studio City, CA 91604). Many
of the individuals referred to in this catalog, which offers taped
interviews or lectures describing their encounters, are either 'contactees'
who have had friendly encounters with the so-called 'Nordic' or human-like
beings who pilot many of the 'alien' craft; or who have been 'abducted' by
the more manipulating and predatory 'Gray' or 'saurian' entities. Quoting
from their description of Mr. Souza's experiences:

"Reaction to the first sighting of a UFO is unpredictable. Jeff Souza had
his first contact in 1979 when he was only 13. The memory of it was tucked
away in the recesses of his mind. Twenty alien contacts during the next 10
years never fully restored the image. But those years were filled with
excitement that would result in one of the most inspirational stories of
alien contact ever recorded.

"The young Brazilian was possessed of intelligence and intuition. He
studied and managed to complete one semester of medical school before
giving up his formal education.

"In contact with two races of extraterrestrials, Jeff has met them in
Brazil, Argentina and the United States. But where they occurred is
unimportant when compared to the depth and cope of what he learned.

"The gentle VEGANS and the business-like UMMITES taught Souza more than he
could ever imagine about technology and life on all planets. He was
transported aboard a spaceship by LIGHT (anti-gravity rays? - Branton) and
taken to other planets and (other) parts of the world. On one such trip he
suffered an unusual reaction - all his hair fell out. His watch broke at
every contact.

"Jeff Souza has been questioned by experts in the field of alien contact.
He has been clinically regressed through hypnotism to the time of his first
contact but the answers came only in Portuguese. At that age, Jeff could
not speak English.

"The details he has learned are awe inspiring. Answers to questions about
time, space, matter, energy, life and spirituality easily rolled from his
tongue. All prompted by the alien contacts of his past and present.

"His interview and the recorded details of his many physical contacts
PROVIDE HITHERTO UNKNOWN INFORMATION ABOUT SEVERAL ALIEN RACES INCLUDING
THE MYSTERIOUS AND THREATENING GRAYS. FROM JEFF SOUZA WE LEARN ABOUT THE
SEVEN RACES (possibly humanoid and/or saurian - Branton), THE ALIEN NAME
FOR EARTH, A SUBTERRANEAN SPACE STATION IN DEATH VALLEY AND IF AIDS MIGHT
BE CURED BY ALIENS.

"There is a final precaution from his contacts - we must all learn the
lessons given to Jeff Souza because we are destroying our planet and if we
don't change, not even the friendly aliens will be able to save us."

We see here then a definite connection between the subterranea of the Death
Valley region, which is reportedly inhabited by the neo-Grecian (?)
Hav-musuvs and the human societies in 'Vega' and 'Ummo', which as we shall
see later on, according to other contactees, are "Federated" with other
human colonies or civilizations in Tau Ceti, Epsilon Eridani, Alpha
Centauri, the Pleiades and elsewhere.

Although Jefferson Souza claims to have encountered the Ummo People in
landed craft, the Vegans are the ones who allowed him to travel on their
craft most often. It was also the Vegans who showed him the MASSIVE basing
complex below Death Valley, which contained chambers miles in diameter and
numerous compartmentalized sectors which had been adapted to meet the
gravitational, atmospheric and environmental needs of the various
Federation world representatives who use the base as a way-station for
their operations on earth. Apparently the Hav-musuvs have been VERY BUSY
for the last few thousand ears, if we are to believe Souza's account.

In addition to the above, Souza learned of two other alien species that are
in conflict to some extent with the humanoids with whom he maintained
contact. One of these includes an "Insectoid" type race, while the other is
reptilian. The latter consists of a tall, very reptilian-saurian appearing
"master" race to which the shorter reptilian "Grays" are subservient. There
are at least three types of "Grays", according to Souza: those that
reproduce via egg-hatcheries, those that reproduce via cloning, and those
that reproduce via polyembryony.

One might ask: if some of our ancient ancestors were so intelligent that
they could develop aerial craft, then where is all the evidence? The
evidence is there, but has been largely ignored by orthodox scientists who
cannot fit the existence of advanced prehistoric civilizations into their
own theoretical framework. For instance:

Ancient sophisticated artifacts discovered imbedded in SOLID ROCK
(including ancient 'spark plugs', metal cubes, gold chains, metal vases,
nails, screws, and even electric batteries such as those described in Rene
Noorbergen's 'SECRETS OF THE LOST RACES' - Bobbs-Merril Co., N.Y.), as well
as artifacts found on the ocean floor, give evidence to the fact that our
ancient ancestors were FAR more intelligent in the scientific realm than we
give them credit for. Yves Naud, in his book "UFO'S AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS
IN HISTORY" (Ferni Publishers, Geneva, Switzerland, 1978) describes one
such artifact:

"In 1900, sponge divers near Antikythera (Greece), found rusty fragments of
a metallic apparatus on the sea floor. Scientists at first thought that
they were remnants of an astrolabe dating from 65 B.C. In 1959, the English
scientist, Solla Price, made a discovery which astounded the professional
world when he published it in the NATURAL HISTORY review of March 1962:

"'It appears that this object is really a computer which can determine and
describe the movements of the sun, of the moon, and probably of the
planets.'

"This modern expert felt extremely humble and could only pay homage to the
high science of our ancestors, although the homage was tinged with fear.

"'It is quite frightening,' he wrote in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (June, 1959),
'to learn that, shortly before their great civilization crumbled, THE
ANCIENT GREEKS had come as close as this to our time, not only in terms of
their thinking, but also in their scientific technology.'"

Back to the Mojave Desert mystery -- it would seem that, based on the
various reports (many of which we will record later on), that the Mojave
Desert of Southern California and the deserts of western Nevada may in fact
be a secret 'battleground' involving U.S. Government troops working in
ALLIANCE with the alien races known as the 'Nordics'. Who are 'they'
fighting? Their battle, according to SEVERAL sources is against the 'Grays'
which have over the last century, possibly earlier, entrenched themselves
below ground in underground 'bases' in the Mojave Desert region and
elsewhere.

Just as the U.S. government is allegedly working with 'Nordics' based at
Mt. Shasta near Weed, California and others in nearby star systems such as
those mentioned above who have a base below the Panamint Mt.-Death Valley
region; their neo-saurian adversaries are allegedly working with others of
their kind within a huge subterranean network centered below the Mt.
Archuleta region near the town of Dulce in Northwestern New Mexico (which
seems to be the U.S. CENTER of activity in regards to MIBs or 'Men In
Black', abductions, mutilations, disappearances, sightings of reptilian
entities and so on).

These 'Grays' are allegedly working with other 'Draconians' who have
established themselves in Alpha Draconis, Epsilon Bootes, Zeta Reticuli,
Altair in Aquila, Rigel and Belletrax Orion, as well as possibly other
NEARBY star systems. Why is this 'war' being carried on in secret? Partly
because the U.S. Government does not believe that the American public can
handle the truth. Just recall Orson Wells' 'WAR OF THE WORLDS' radio
program of so many years ago, and the panic it incited.

In reference to Zeta Reticuli, from where many of the Grays are said to
'originate', Jeffrey L. Kretch, in his article 'THE AGE OF NEARBY STARS'
(which appeared in ASTRONOMY Magazine in response to Terence Eckerson's
Dec. 1974 article 'THE ZETA RETICULI INCIDENT', describing the Hill
abduction, an article which incidentally raised more interest among the
readership than any other article the magazine had published), makes note
of the METAL and CARBON deficiencies of this binary system. He suggests
that carbon-based life could not have 'evolved' in such an environment, and
he may be right, for the 'Grays' have 'told' some abductees that they are
actually RETURNING to earth, their native planet. No doubt 'they' will try
to use this argument, even if true, in an attempt to justify their planned
takeover of the planet.

Recently one researcher, K.S., was approached by the family of a U.S.
Intelligence worker (O.S.I.) by the name of 'Tucker', who had disappeared
mysteriously. They were concerned and frightened as they had discovered, in
a personal locker of his, SEVERAL papers describing INTIMATE details of
activities surrounding the Dulce, New Mexico and Nevada (S-4, etc.)
underground installations. Among this large stack of papers was hidden the
following letter which was stamped 'SECRET'. The letter, copies of which
were apparently also in the hands of a few other researchers as well,
stated the following:

"Dear John...

"I am writing to you in the event that I do not return.

"There is a triangle surrounding the Nevada Test Site.

"There are in fact two of them. Each one frontiers on the other. One is the
ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TRIANGLE, installed by MJ-12. This is a shield to protect
the 'Benevolents' (very human looking) from the EBEs (so-called
"extraterrestrial biological entities" or Grays - Branton) while they help
us develop our counter-attack/defenses. The other is the EBEs' 'trap'
keeping the benevolents in the redoubt... At each corner of the EM Triangle
you will find BLM stations and they are the transmitters of the shield.

"Facing each one of these is an EBE transmitter... There are MANY OF THESE
STAND-OFFS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. It is important that you do not interfere
by attempting to destroy one of their 'surrounds', they would be able to
'double-up' some- where else and overthrow that position. Once that link is
over- thrown, our support team would fail. Their over extension is
deliberate on our part. We are like the Chinese, we can't out technology
them but we can out number them. Especially since they can't breed here and
it is too far for them to go back home without our help. Many of our EM
Triangles are ruses to keep them over extended. They can't get out of our
solar system because our electro-magnetic field (at this time - Branton) is
the wrong frequency for their propulsion system to work efficiently. This
explains why the EBEs can not commit more vehicles to our solar system."

The humans at the Nevada Test Site 'may' in fact, if we are to believe some
researchers, be victims of subtle reptilian propaganda and intimidation.
For instance, this source apparently believes that ALL the saurian-grays or
EBE's come from extraterrestrial worlds. However as we've shown there is
much evidence that saurian activity exists within deep sub- terranean
levels and cavities throughout the earth, and has so for many centuries.
This is a fact that the saurians have tried to hide from humankind, both
terrestrial and extraterrestrial. Also, there are accounts suggesting that
the sauroids, grays, etc., ARE IN FACT breeding profusely and reproducing
them- selves via deep subterranean polyembryony tanks below Dulce and
elsewhere, and are not as 'over-extended' as they might have us to believe.

However, on the other hand, the fear the humans might have of prematurely
attacking the 'enemy' positions might possibly be propaganda intended to
keep humans from taking OFFENSIVE action, believing they are keeping the
grays, etc., 'at bay' when in fact the Grays ARE ATTACKING OFFENSIVELY
HUMAN SOCIETY on other hidden fronts via mass abductions, deception,
implantations, psychic manipulation, recruitment of 'fifth column' humans
and infiltration. We personally do not believe in 'standoffs'. In war there
is no 'neutrality', one is either attacking (in various ways) or being
attacked, in various ways -- ways which those on the defensive might not
even be aware of. The letter continued:

"The 'headquarters' of this particular 'surround' is Deep Springs,
California. At this location one can find a 'school' for Communist
homosexuals who have defected to the EBEs in exchange for a cure for AIDs
and a promise to their own little world, including reproduction via cloning
and artificial wombs. Their sperm fertilize eggs taken from abductees. You
will not likely see the hybrids hidden inside the mountain, unless you
have... starlite binoculars. Some homosaphien APPEARING malevolents
(mercenaries) are also there. Nine Soviets were there at the same time
Soviets were at the NTS. They were there in the hopes of talking them into
defecting back to our side. We are still hopeful.

"The collaborators use the cover organization Natural Resources Defense
Council, with front offices in New York and 1350 New York Avenue, N.W.,
suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20005 [tel.(202) 783-7800]. It is headed by Tom
Cochran, staffed by Kevin Priestly UNR, John Brune UNR, Holly Eisler UnSan
Diego, Gary Reisling Univ. Ca. Pasadena, Holly Nelson NY, Mary Manning LV
Sun, Ed Vogel LVR; and many others I can reveal later.

"One will also find that each corner of their triangle is at the base of a
mountain. At each location you will find several entrances to underground
systems. Do not attempt to enter, unless you wish to become liquid protein.
You may however harass the EBEs' two other corners by placing a large
magnet on the vaults... (placing a magnet on the other two entrances at
each location will not affect anything). This temporarily interrupts their
communications with Deep Springs until a collaborator team comes out to see
what is going on. If you place a large magnet on this entrance (it has a
large computer near the surface, you can hear it), it will affect an
immediate interruption. So, you can take it off in a short time (1 hr) and
take it with you. They will still have to come and reset the system. If you
plant magnets (camouflaged like rocks) around these entrances, the EBEs
won't come out & the sell outs won't be able to find them. The EBEs are
also allergic to high concentrations of sugar. You will find that at two
locations I have poured sugar around their exits. Always wear magnets near
these locations, they interrupt the EBEs' sense of direction (due to an
internal compass much like those found in migrating birds) similar to our
loss of balance when our ear drum is affected.

"Please wait until I have returned, if you have an airplane, I would like
to take aerial photos, we can photograph them together.

"Our alliance crest, symbolic of the EM Shield, and our sign/mark/graffiti
is inclosed. Do not reveal them or else every- body will use them & you
won't know the real from the pseudos.

     "YOU DO NOT KNOW ME, I DO NOT KNOW YOU. THIS IS NOT FOR PUBLIC
     DISSEMINATION. ZEALOTS MAY DISRUPT THE BALANCE BEFORE V-EBE DAY."

Another researcher by the name (or pseudonym) of Jason Bishop has revealed
that 'John', to whom the letter was addressed, is non other than John Lear
(one of the most decorated test pilots in U.S. history, and whose father
William Lear founded Lear Jet Corp., invented the 8-track tape recorder,
and so on) who himself claims many connections with people 'in the know'.
According to the letter, both the Nevada Test Site and Deep Springs are
areas of conflict between U.S. Govt.-'Nordic' groups who are at war with
the saurian grays or the 'reptilians' - since the internal makeup of the
grays is reportedly reptilian- based rather than mammalian-based.

Jason Bishop also released some other information he received by way of
John Lear, from this individual whose letter we just quoted. According to
Lear, the author of the letter was actually a Security Officer at the Test
Site who had called in to the Billy Goodman talk show (KVEG radio - Las
Vegas, NV) on a few occasions. This person used the codename:
'Yellowfruit,' which he claimed was actually the codename of a top secret
group that worked at the site, with which he was involved. YF also sent
Lear a copy of the 'Benevolent' teachings. The 'Benevolents' are allegedly
working at the Test Site with MJ-12 and are 'Blond-Nordic and/or
Aryan-like' people. It is not certain whether these 'aliens' are tied in
with the so-called exterran Nordic' Pleiadeans, the terran 'Aryan'
Antarcticans, or the subterran 'Blond' Telosians - as all three groups
allegedly exist according to different sources, and may have been confused
with each other in the past. All three of these groups allegedly posses
aerial disks, although in reality their societies may be somewhat distinct
from each other.

The BENEVOLENT TEACHINGS (not limited to the below) were identified as
follows:

"DISCOURAGED - NON PREPARATORY SPORTS (Activities That Can Not Be Used In
Nonsporting Life) motocross, auto- racing, skateboarding, roller skating,
football, baseball, hockey. Also Discouraged: Processed Sugar, Recreational
Carbo- hydrates, Recreational Fluids, White Bread.

"ENCOURAGED - NONCEREMONIAL LESSONS OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS & PREPARATORY
SPORTS (Activities That Can Be Used In Nonsporting Life) swimming, running,
hiking, martial arts, survival arts. Teach Your Children!

"FORBIDDEN - Alcohol, Illegal Drugs, Nicotine, Recreational Drugs,
Unjustifiable Homicide.

"MUST - Avoid Weakness (evil grows in weakness). Execute Evil Prisoners In
Order To Help Other Prisoners (Editors Note: One personal suggestion would
be to place all 'unreformable' death-row prisoners together for life,
without possibility of parol, in large though sealed single-entrance
extreme-security closely- monitored DEEP underground 'prisons' with others
of their own kind and gender. Provide minimum life provisions and possibly
even religious-Christian consultation, or broadcasting, and hope at least
that the 'Hell' that these people make for each other will motivate some of
them to seek for a better existence in the afterlife - Branton).

"MUST - Quarantine Contagious Disease (AIDS) Victims Humanely. Show
Strength. Stop Illegal Drugs. Stop Destruction of Environment. Stop
Pollution. Use Nuclear Power.

"STUDY - Bill Of Rights, Biology, Computers, Economics, Geography, History,
Latin, Mathematics, Philosophy, Survival Skills, United States Of America's
Declaration Of Independence, United States Of America's Constitution,
Vocational Skills."

Yellowfruit also provided coordinates for the Electro-magnetic Triangles he
referred to in his letter. These include: N 37 22 30 - E 117 58 0; N 38 21
0 - E 115 35 0; N 35 39 0 - E 114 51 0. Also: Yucca Lake: N 37 0 30 - E 116
7 0.

From what we can gather from the letter quoted earlier 'there are many'
areas of conflict or 'standoff' between the humans and saurians around the
world. Those who realize that the conflict exists, such as the inner
government, have failed to warn the general population of the problem
possibly out of fear. However, as we have seen, the documentation proving
that such a hidden conflict between the human and serpent races has existed
since ancient times is surfacing en masse. We must realize however that due
to the likelihood of the existence of recovered antediluvian technologies
(as well as the apparent existence of hidden human and reptilian
communities within the earth, which have utilized and added to such
technologies since ancient times), the possibility exists that this 'war'
began on the surface of the earth, spread to the caverns, and was later
propelled out into interplanetary and interstellar space.

From the depths of the earth both 'races', as these technologies developed,
apparently rushed to take control of as much territory as possible before
the other side had a chance to, the humans - motivated more by their desire
to expand their civilizations for the good of their overall societies; and
the reptilians (and possibly humans "sellouts" who had collaborated with
them) - motivated largely through Imperialistic tendencies, including the
desire to establish god-like control over all creation without regard for
universal law, a 'prime directive', etc. However, we must be reminded that
man is partially to blame for opening the 'door' for these intelligent yet
corrupted creatures to enter in and invade our societies, as well as
possibly opening the way for their parasitical infestation of the heavens.
Perhaps the 'war in heaven' between Michael and the 'Dragon' or the 'Old
Serpent', referred to in REVELATION chapter 12, ties in with this scenario
as well?!

Utilizing the ancient technologies and adding upon them through a
multiplication process, it is uncertain just which 'race' was first able to
land itself upon Luna and other planetary bodies, the humans or the
reptilians? But there are indications that they both may have done so at
least a few thousand years ago, give or take a millenia. According to John
Lear's Intelligence sources, U.S. astronauts have even been warned of the
dangers of space exploration by human 'UFO' occupants who have allegedly
monitored and even accompanied many of the space shots - possibly something
along the line of similarity to an older brother teaching a younger brother
how to ride a bike, although in this case the stakes are much higher. Many
of these 'dangers' would no doubt include malevolent alien entities.

UFO's have also allegedly followed U.S. space shots such as the Apollo and
the Shuttle flights, the latter of which have actually 'filmed' what appear
to be battles between alien craft and earth-based 'SDI' defense systems.
The Apollo shots were allegedly followed FROM EARTH by UFO's, suggesting
that an ancient Terran society which already went through the 'space race'
phase, perhaps hundreds or thousands of years ago, was concerned with the
feeble efforts of their 'little brothers' to move out into space. As we
will see later on in this file, the possibility that an ancient Terran race
developed space travel thousands of years ago is one which may be backed-up
by actual evidence. When we realize that the United States itself became
the major world power in less than two hundred years, and as we've said had
essentially gone from the 'horse-and-buggy' to interplanetary travel in
less than 75 years; then how much activity might have resulted in
extraterrestrial realms over a period of two or three thousand years by
human AND saurian beings whose 'sciences' were increasing at a synchronous
rate?

Also, do the 'benevolent' human-aliens allegedly working at the Nevada Test
Site have any connection with the Hav-musuvs described earlier? Were the
'human' occupied bases on Luna as seen by NASA officials, according to
George H. Leonard and others, actually installations placed there by the
Hav-musuvs or another society affiliated with them? These are questions we
intend to answer in this File.

As we've indicated, there are numerous accounts suggesting that an ancient
race who utilize high-technology now resides in the bowels of Mt. Shasta in
the Cascade Range of northern California. According to researcher William
F. Hamilton, who claims to have met representatives of this society, the
inhabitants of the subterranean 'city' under Mt. Shasta are usually tall,
blue- eyed blonds who number in excess of over one-and-a-half million in
their large 5-leveled, 20-mile long underground city.

Mt. Shasta has been a major site for UFO contacts for decades. Also Indian
legends - as well as stories of strange people being seen on it's slopes -
abound there. These accounts are so well-known that many of the travel
guides to the Shasta area mention the legends of the ancient people who are
said to dwell within this ancient volcanic peak.

Aside from the apparent 'Greek' connection with the under- ground city
allegedly existing beneath Mt. Shasta (that is, the name 'Telos' itself,
which is a GREEK word that literally means 'uttermost, purpose'), Mr.
Hamilton also states that some of the 'Telosians' claim to be descended
from ancient cultures such as the 'Quetzals' and the 'Naga-Mayas'. This
seems to indicate a possible Meso-American connection or origin of some of
the alleged inhabitants of Shasta. Is it possible that South American
cultures AND Mediterranean cultures such as the ancient Greeks 'teamed up'
in their obsession to explore the heavens?

James Churchward (who authored several books describing the history of an
alleged sunken island-continent which he believed existed within the Indian
Ocean and which went by the name of 'MU') has indicated that the
'Naga-Mayas' were a human tribe tied-in with ancient India. Whether the
Telosians are descended from ancient Mayapan, India or Greece is not clear.
It is possible as we've said that many ancient empires, such as was
suggested in the Hav-musuv account, flowed-in to each other and traded and
interacted with each other to a large degree.

Early archeologist Augustus Le Plongeon, one of the first researchers to do
an in-depth study of the Mayan Language, came under criticism from orthodox
scientists when he claimed to have broken the Mayan language code, and
learned of the close connections the Mayas had with Egypt, India and an
ancient island continent called 'MU'. Although Churchward placed MU in the
Indian Ocean, Le Plongeon placed it somewhere in the Caribbean, perhaps in
the Bermuda Triangle region - possibly mistaking it with the ante-diluvian
'Atlantis' legends. Others however place MU or ELAM-MU off the west coast
of North America or, in fact, identify modern-day California as none other
than the ancient kingdom of MU which in ancient times was a peninsula or
large island just of the California coast, as the Havmu-suv account seems
to suggest. It is also possible that the 'MUrians' had several 'colonies'
throughout the ancient world.

Zechariah Sitchin, author of many books, states that some Mayas may
originally have came from Egypt. This might be the case when we realize the
apparent similarities between the Egyptians and Mayas as they can be seen
in the Mayan and Egyptian Pyramids, and so on. Another possibility is one
suggested by Churchward, that the Mayas or Naga-Mayas came from India.
However, even if they came from Egypt, a connection to India may still
exist, for the ancient Greek writer Philostratus insists that the first
Egyptians were originally navigators from INDIA! Whether or not the Mayas
were originally descended from the Egyptians OR ancient East Indians, there
is much evidence that the Mayas WERE never- the-less a highly scientific
society, who were well advanced in medicine, astronomy, architecture and
mathematics. In fact, Charles Berlitz (author of many books on the Bermuda
Triangle, the Philadelphia Experiment, and other mysteries) refers to the
account of a Colorado art historian by the name of Jose Arguelles.

Arguelles claimed to have met an old Mayan 'sage' by the name of Humbarty
Men who told him that his people, the Mayas, still exist as a civilization
(underground? - Branton) and that they have in the last millennia succeeded
in 'navigating' at least seven nearby planetary systems through advanced
spacefaring technologies.

In relation to this, a man by the name of Morris Doreal, also of Colorado
(a state which is or was believed to be the home of an advanced
subterranean human culture), runs an organization called the 'Brotherhood
of the White Temple'. Doreal claims to have visited a few of the ancient
underground cities and alleges that several 'members' of his organization
are Guatemalan Indians of Mayan descent who have told him of their own
knowledge of subterranean cities inhabited by both good and evil
(reptilian?) beings. It is true that there are many strange caverns in the
regions of Yucatan and Guatemala. Eastern Guatemala has 'Silpino Cave'
which has allegedly been explored for months in the direction of ancient
volcanic cones without the daring Speleonauts' ever finding an end to the
labyrinth; while the 'Loltun Caves' of Yucatan have an even more
interesting history, being surrounded with accounts of ancient treasure
troves, endless passages, encounters with people within it's depths who
claimed to be centuries old, and even stories of lost tribes who vanished
into the depths while fleeing their enemies, never to be seen again. Now
back to the subject of the Hav-musuvs and the mysterious Mojave and Death
Valley region.

In addition to all of the above, there is much evidence that thousands of
years ago the 'Nordic' Vikings landed on the west coast of the Americas.
However, whether 'they' have anything at all to add to this scenario is
uncertain. The best possible source however for the 'Hav-musuvs' and in
fact the 'Telosians' themselves seems to be the ancient Greeks AND Mayas
(Greco-Mayans?), although as we've indicated, possibly several ancient
societies may have been working together. It is said by some that the
Greeks borrowed much of their scientific thought from India during the time
of Alexander the Great, and subsequently may have put this scientific
thought into physical applications which were in turn shared with some of
the leaders of India. As we will see later on, the ancient Greeks AND
(Aryan?) East Indians may have been collaborating thousands of years ago in
a 'space race' which propelled these cultures outwards to nearby star
systems, possibly a millennia or more before the appearance of Christ.

In 1961, SEARCH Magazine published a letter in it's October issue, pp.
76-81, from a Gene A. Statler of (at the time) North Street, Jackson,
Missouri. Excerpts from this letter are given here:

"Dear Mr. Palmer: A few days ago I wrote you a letter in which I brought to
your attention an item which was placed by you in the Classified
Advertisements section of the December, 1959, issue of SEARCH MAGAZINE. In
this ad, you requested any information as to the whereabouts of L. Taylor
Hansen, who had disappeared twelve years prior to that issue, and he was
quoted as saying that he had discovered a black, polished shaft, leading
down into the earth near Death Valley.

"You will remember that I mentioned that it was strange to have the poem,
'The Curse of Tippecanoe', listed as written by Hansen if the author had
been missing for fourteen years. Well, my face is really red! While looking
over some of the newest SEARCH and FLYING SAUCER magazines, I found that no
less than five articles in the past three issues of your magazines have
been written by Mr. Hansen. Therefore, I can safely assume that Mr. Hansen
is not missing! Please accept my apologies for my rash statements. I'll try
to be a little more comprehensive in my investigations the next time I try
to make an earth-shaking announcement!

"However, my one suggestion still stands. Why not inform everyone, if you
have not already done so, as to the real, whole story behind Hansen's
disappearance and his discovery? What was his polished, black shaft?"

Ray Palmer's editorial reply to Statler's letter was as follows:

"...It is true that we searched for Mr. Hansen for all those years, and
when we found him, he had this cryptic remark to make concerning his
whereabouts: 'It would be best just to drop the subject.' However, we do
have Mr. Hansen back doing articles for us, and not only that, but we have
one book manuscript in production - one on Atlantis, and one on Lemuria. We
feel sure that these will be quite sensational, and it may be they will
answer a lot of unanswered questions concerning Mr. Hansen and his
mysterious twelve-year silence."

As we have seen by the Hav-musuv and related accounts, hidden technological
societies descended from ancient Grecia or other ancient societies, may
very well have established aerospace travel several hundred, if not a few
thousand, years ago.

Assuming this, once aerial travel was accomplished by ancient races such as
those described by Oga-Make, William Hamilton and others, 'space' travel
would be the next logical step. There are indications that the Hav-musuvs
may have been only one of many ancient 'Terran' groups to discover 'free-
energy' (electromagnetic) propulsion, and they certainly have not been the
last. The problem is, when a segment of the human race, a scientific cabal
for instance, stumbles upon the secret of electromagnetic propulsion (or
even atomic, mercury, ion or tachyon energy drives - tachyons being an
actual faster-than- light particle recognized by quantum physicists), they
have a propensity to seclude themselves from mainstream humanity. This was
usually done, according to various accounts, out of a fear that their
technologies would be stolen and used for destructive purposes. It has only
been in recent centuries that this 'techno-imperialism' on the part of the
secret scientific fraternities has weakened, as the overall masses of
humanity have demanded their 'share' of the technological 'pie', and with
it they have also recieved the darker side of technology - machine guns,
missiles, atomic weapons - the works.

Usually man has a suspicious outlook toward his fellow man, understandably,
and this has apparently led many such sub- terranean cultures to develop
their technologies in secret. Some hidden societies such as the MIB or 'Men
In Black' have been especially defensive of intrusion and have used a type
of 'psychological terrorism' in order to keep their secrets hidden from
those on the surface, especially now that the technologies of the
'International' societies are becoming more refined. This defensiveness and
paranoia on the part of the MIB might be explained by their own guiltiness
which stems from their ancient associations with the serpent races, and the
subsequent mental control which the reptilians have established throughout
their own and other 'collaborative' societies. Many of the MIB' however are
prisoners of environmental influence and cannot be condemned for being
'born' into such a society (we refer here to the 'humanoid' MIB, although
androidal and even reptilian 'Men In Black' have also been encountered).
There is no telling how many times such a scenario (of a society
discovering the utilization of electro- magnetic energy and subsequently
dis-connecting themselves from mainstream society) has run its course
throughout the millennia.

As for the 'Men In Black', which according to researchers like John Keel
are an 'Illuminati-like' secret society who may be collaborating with the
malevolents (reptilians), their Black Automobiles have been seen entering
and leaving underground areas, like for instance--according to one
witness--a particular mountain near a road that runs between Hopland and
Lakeport California, a road on which many automobiles including government
vehicles have allegedly disappeared throughout the years.

The Haitians refer to these large black automobiles, which have sometimes
been seen 'apparently' operating without a visible driver, as the 'Zobops'.
The superstitious Haitians, many of whom are into Voodoo and serpent
worship themselves, refer to the Zobops as a race of sorcerers, and add
that if one sees one of these large black automobiles apparently operating
without a driver that they had better leave it alone. As we have suggested,
there are also many cases which suggest that many of the so- called 'Men In
Black' are not human at all.

But whether good or evil, there are apparently numerous societies--many of
them highly advanced technologically and many of them very ancient--who
have hidden themselves away from mainstream surface societies, again for
either benevolent or malevolent reasons. There is, in fact, evidence that
such high-tech ancient cultures did exist in ancient times:

Yves Naud, in his book "UFO'S AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN HISTORY," records
actual accounts of ancient metallurgy factories, as well as documented
evidence that the ancients were very familiar with atomic sciences. He
states that: "...The manufacture of metal objects (a very advanced form of
metallurgy would be necessary in the construction of machines or aerospace
craft - Branton) presupposes the existence of appropriate factories. In
spite of the fact that the modern mind draws back from this conclusion, we
are forced to accept the evidence. Dr. Korioun Meguertchian, brought to
light a foundry where the Ancients worked copper, lead, zinc, manganese,
steel, etc. Scientists who were doubtful of the existence of blast furnaces
now have material proof: twenty-five of these constructions have been
discovered, but it is calculated that there must have been at least two
hundred..."

These ancient scientists as we've indicated also seem to have made
persistent efforts to hide their knowledge from irresponsible persons,
although some of this ancient knowledge apparently did fall into the wrong
hands, if certain accounts of ancient nuclear explosions are to be
believed. Yves Naud reveals: "We again encounter traces of the antique
atomic sciences in India. The Brahman treatises VAISESIKE and NYAYA, the
sacred book YOGA VASISCHTA, all speak of the structure of matter: 'There
are vast worlds within the voids of each atom, as diversified as dust in
the rays of sunlight.'

"Being wiser than we are, and aware of the danger that atomic force
represented, the Ancients divulged none of the secrets of that science to
the profane, in order that the atom would not be used for destructive ends.
'It would be the greatest of sins,' a Chinese wrote, a thousand years or
more ago, 'to disclose the secret of our art to soldiers.'

"Antique people knew about the atom, but were they capable of producing an
atomic explosion? Scientists spent a long time wondering about this
question until the discovery of the DRONA PARVA, a Hindu text which
recounts the explosion of an atomic bomb:

"'A flaring projectile with the brilliance of a flame without smoke, was
launched. A great darkness suddenly obscured the skies. Clouds thundered in
the uppermost air, releasing a downpour of blood. Burned by the heat of
this arm, the world appeared shaken by fever.'

"...The physicist, Frederick Soddy, asks: 'In these old tales, can't we see
some justification of the belief that prior representatives of a forgotten
race of men not only achieved the level of knowledge that we have so
recently attained, but even a power that we do not yet have?' Indeed,
traces of ARTIFICIAL radioactivity have been detected in various parts of
the world in the course of diggings into antique sites. In India a skeleton
was exhumed which revealed a powerful intensity of radioactivity. This
would tend to confirm the theory of atomic explosions in prehistory." Mr.
Naud concludes.

Daniel Cohen, in his book "THE ANCIENT VISITORS" (Doubleday & Co. Inc., New
York. 1976), also relates an account taken from an ancient text concerning
what might have been aerial craft developed by an old race: "A number of
ancient epics from India contain descriptions of fiery flying chariots.
There are lines like this one, 'Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous
ray which was brilliant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a
storm.'"

Yves Naud related still other accounts suggesting that ancient Terrans did
in fact attempt space travel...successfully:

"A CHINESE ON THE MOON 4,300 YEARS BEFORE THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS -
The ancient people, making use of their astronomical knowledge, may have
been able to launch out into the exploration of space.

"'The way was long, and as if enveloped in darkness,' explains Chu Yan, a
Chinese poet of the third century B.C. Chinese tradition narrates the
extraordinary adventure of Hou Yih, an engineer of the Emperor Yao, who
decided, 4,300 years ago, to go to the moon with a 'celestial bird.' In the
course of the flight, the bird indicated to the traveler the exact
movements of the rising, the apogee, and the setting of the sun. Hou Yih
thereafter explained that he 'sailed up the current of luminous air.' Could
this current have been the exhaust of a rocket?

"'He no longer perceived the rotary movement of the sun,' the narrator
points out. Effectively, contemporary astronauts have noted that, in space,
it was not possible to discern the diurnal passage of the sun. And what did
the Chinese engineer observe on the moon? He saw 'an horizon which appeared
frozen.' To protect himself from the glacial air, he built the 'Palace of
the Great Cold.' His wife, Chang Ngo, left to join him on the satellite,
which she described as 'a luminous sphere, brilliant as glass, of an
enormous size, and very cold.'"

If one such flight to the moon was successful, then we must assume that
many others followed. Actually, Yves Naud quotes another ancient legend
from China which suggests that at one point a great 'space race' to explore
and colonize nearby planets was a reality, and that as a result of a
perverted race of troglodytes the world was thrown into a dark ages which
led to an almost complete loss of contact and communication between the
other-planetary colonists and the ancient world. Quoting from the legend:

"...The Mao-tse were (a) perverted race which had taken refuge in the
caverns. It is said that their descendants still live in the outlying areas
of Canton. Then, under the influence of Tchu-Yeo, they stirred up trouble
throughout the world, and it became ridden with highwaymen. The lord
Chan-Ty (a king of the so-called 'divine' dynasty) saw that the people had
lost every vestige of virtue. And so he ordered Tchang and Lhy to cut all
communication between heaven and earth. From that time on there was no more
going up nor coming down."

In connection to the above, it may not be any coincidence that John A. Keel
states on pp. 93-94 of his book 'THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES' (Signet Books,
N.Y., 1975 paperback edition) the following concerning certain UFO
witnesses: "...In some cases, ancient lettering like Greek or Chinese
appears on the object. The effect is the same. Months, even years, later
the same percipient may again see the same numbers or letters on an
object..."

From the ancient text, the BRIHAT KAHTA, we read how the ancient
inhabitants of INDIA were aware of the flying craft WHICH HAD BEEN
DEVELOPED BY CERTAIN GREEKS who were very possessive of their scientific
and mechanical knowledge. In the ancient account we read:

"Padmavit explains that Queen Vasavadotta wishes to fly in a chariot to
visit the (other parts of) earth. Vasantoke, the Master of Entertainment,
broke into a laugh and told her: 'The women servants of the king have
exactly that same desire. I have told them to suspend a swing between two
high poles and to use this to go to and fro in the air. And if the queen
wishes these aerial voyages, then she must content herself in the same
fashion!' Everybody started to laugh, but Rumanavit cut in, 'That is quite
enough joking,' he said, 'now let us look at the facts.' 'We are talking in
the void,' Yangandharayame interrupted. 'That is a problem for the
artisans.'

"Rumanavit convoked the carpenters and gave them strict injunction to build
a flying machine at once. The corps of artisans joined together and after a
long period of shuffling about in an effort to avoid the whole problem,
they finally sent their delegators, trembling in fear, to find Rumanavit.
'We know of four sorts of machines,' they told him, 'those made of water,
those made of air, those made of dust, and those composed of a great many
pieces. But as far as flying machines are concerned, we have never even
seen one. The Yavanas (Greeks) are the ones who know about them.'

"Then a Brahmin spoke of a carpenter, Pukrasaka, whom the King had told
(of) the existence of a certain Vicvita, who was mounted upon a mechanical
cock. The foreign ambassadors whispered: 'We should never reveal the secret
of the flying machines to anyone whomsoever, be he artisan or other. It is
too difficult to understand for one who is NOT GREEK.'

"All of a sudden, a stranger (a Greek?) appeared. He called upon Rumanavit
to supply him with necessary material, and he built a flying chariot in
(the) form of Garuda (the eagle with a human body, the steed of 'Vishnu').
It was ornamented with flowers. The queen and her husband flew around the
world and then returned to their city..."

This account, as we can see, indicates that the ANCIENT East Indians and
Greeks were allies and were working together in the development of aerial
craft. Could this explain the apparent involvement of neo-Grecian, and
possibly 'Indian' and Mayan cultures in connection with the human
civilizations living in the various cavern systems beneath California?

There are other indications besides those that we've just mentioned which
suggest that the ancient Greeks were very steeped in the intellectual
sciences and used this knowledge to explore the unknown regions. Is it
possible that before the Grecian empire crumbled, certain members of that
society continued to carry on their own version of their civilization in
remote outposts beneath or beyond the earth? According to Judeo-Christian
history and prophecy (book of Daniel), four world 'empires' would run their
course before the Messiah Himself finally reigned as king of an
incorruptible Kingdom. The first was the Babylonian empire, second was the
Medo-Persian Empire, followed by the Grecian empire which would subdue "the
face of the whole earth" (see: Daniel 8:5,21). The last empire would be the
largest, cruelest and most oppressive, the Roman Empire. It would rise and
rule the nations, and then 'fall' in a sense although still retain
considerable control over the 'religious' world (Revelation ch. 17-18) and
then revive into a '10-horned' empire ruled by a counterfeit messiah.

The idea that the Grecian empire went about "on the face of the whole
earth" might be significant if we consider that the 'Hav-musuvs' for
instance were connected with ancient Grecia. As for the highly intellectual
nature of the Greeks, this was confirmed by the Apostle Paul, who alleged
that during his visit to Athens, Greece, "...the Atheneans and strangers
which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or
to hear some new thing." (Acts 17:21). Actually, when we consider the
possibility that an ancient Grecian-like race developed aerospace travel
thousands of years ago and compare this with modern accounts of human
UFOnauts, there are indications that a connection between the two may be
found. Many modern historians attribute our present sciences to the ancient
Greek philosophers. However, when the Dark Ages of Roman Inquisition came
these sciences were suppressed. But what if, as some suggest, certain of
the early Greek philosophical-fraternal- scientific societies discovered
for themselves hidden abodes far from the oppression of mainstream society
and continued to develop their sciences with the freedom and creativity
that only such hidden colonies could provide?

One very interesting account, which seems to indicate that hi-tech human
societies on and within the earth did in fact colonize other planetary
bodies thousands of years ago, appeared in SEARCH magazine. The article,
titled "BRACE YOURSELVES", was written by an ex-NASA employee who
identified himself only as 'The Doc'. His account appeared in the Winter,
1988-89 issue of that magazine. This ex-NASA employee related at the
beginning of the article two very remarkable things that he'd heard while
working at NASA. One of them included the discovery that the sun's surface
may not be a region of continuous thermonuclear activity as has commonly
been believed. Instead, scientists had found that it appeared to be in
essence a tremendous electromagnetic dynamo or sphere which in turn
generates the electromagnetic fields of the planets. In other words it
seemed to be more of a gigantic electrical 'light' or 'sphere' than a
gigantic thermonuclear reactor, although nuclear reactions might play a
part, but not nearly to the extent that many believe.

Some have alleged that the 'heat' experienced from the solar orb on a
planets' surfaces is not so much determined by their proximity to the sun,
but more by the amount and type of atmosphere with which the solar
radiations and rays interact to produce friction and heat. In simple terms,
the sun is not 'hot' in the sense that most believe, but the solar flares
and explosions taking place on the surface of the sun are more consistent
with tremendous electrical 'arcs' than with nuclear explosions. The other
'revelation' he received from other NASA employees was that the U.S. Navy
has for several year been making regular reconnaissance-observation trips
to monitor alien 'bubble-cities' on the ocean floor.

Some years afterwards, while practicing homeopathic medicine in Phoenix,
Arizona in 1984, 'The Doc' met a young man who had come into his office to
pick up some 'UFO photos' he had loaned to a different doctor on a previous
visit. The ex- NASA employee struck up a conversation with the young man.
Following is an excerpt from the conversation which ensued between the
young man and 'The Doc' during that visit. The young man said, after
talking to 'The Doc' about the photos:

"So, do you know anything about UFO's?"

"Only what I've read since the 1950's and hear tell by others who have had
encounters. How about yourself?"

"Well, there are such craft now in our atmosphere with bases underground
and underwater. One group is very advanced and can take you anywhere in the
universe."

"Should Einstein be upset to hear that?" I thought about it for awhile.

"There is a whole science concerning traveling above the speed of light.
These people are so advanced that most of the world is not ready to
understand or appreciate their values and their scientific attainment."

"Well, no matter how advanced their technology, spiritually they have the
same plight as we. We are all spiritual brothers and sisters and must solve
the mystery of returning to our Source."

He looked at me penetratingly and continued.

"When I was eight years old and playing with a friend out in a field, a
craft came down, landed not far from us and a man and woman came out and
walked up to us, smiling and calling us by name. They seemed to know all
about me, what school I was going to, what subjects I liked best, and they
told me that they would every so many years return and visit with me. They
also said that they wanted me to do well in school."

"Did they return?" I asked, smiling, half in disbelief.

"Yes, surprisingly, they did. About five years later. I was about thirteen
or fourteen. They told me that I was one of them and I was put on this
planet to help them someday in the future."

"Incredible!" I played along with this.

"You haven't heard the best part. I was nineteen and was driving one night
up through a wooded area in Connecticut, and suddenly this saucer swooped
down over my car. I almost drove off the highway I was so shocked. It paced
me, staying just above the car, and this voice came over my car radio
speakers, but my radio wasn't even on! This voice knew my name and asked a
number of times, 'Dave (pseudonym), when will you return home? You have
been gone so long.'

"I was really shaken up by this, and then they somehow lifted my car off
the highway and took me over a hill and brought me back down on the same
highway, without my tires even squealing. They finally said that they would
return again someday.

"I stopped at the first public phone and phoned my parents in Vermont. When
my mother answered I was so shaken and anxious over the possibility of my
parents having not told me the truth, I didn't bother to tell her what had
happened on the highway. 'Mom, who am I?'

"'Why, Dave, you're my son.'

"'Mother, who am I really? How did I get into this world?'

"'Son, you got into this world just like other boys. I delivered you in a
hospital.'

"'Mom, I don't believe it. Over and over I have been visited by people in
starships who, somehow, know me. They say I am supposed to help them
someday. Their ship just came down over my car, they called me by name and
toyed with me about when I would come home to them someday. And then they
picked up my car off the highway and gave me quite a shocker of a ride. I'm
different, aren't I. I want to hear the truth.'

"There was a long silence at the other end of the phone."

"'All right. We were going to tell you someday as you have continued to
mention these kind of things. Your father and I found you and your sister
one evening as we were walking out behind the cabin like we did every
evening after dinner. We found you and your sister wrapped in a blanket
nestled between some boulders up on the hillside. We couldn't believe what
we saw. You both were dressed in shiny one-piece suits. You were about a
year old. We asked around and could not find anyone that might know your
parents. We figured that you had been abandoned but we both had the
strongest impulse to take care of you both until someone came into town and
asked about you.'"

I was now shaking my head. "And have you continued to be visited by your
friends?"

"Yes. More frequently, like a calendar."

"Where are they from?" He had me going now.

"Are you familiar with the Seven Sisters constellation?"

"I don't think so."

"It's also called the Pleiades constellation."

"Why are they, YOU here?"

"They won't interfere for the most part with the social problems and
destiny of the Earth. It's a policy of theirs."

I was standing up now looking sad, "I'm sorry to hear that..."

"The Doc" then gave him a checkup, since the young man had originally come
in for back problems. After he had informed the doctor that his back no
longer bothered him, he told "The Doc" that he had to rush to catch a
flight to Switzerland, and left the clinic.

"As I was turning into my office," the Doc continued, "one of the
chiropractic physicians called as he was walking towards me down the hall
carrying an X-ray.

"'Look at this X-ray. This guy is really different.'

"I looked at it. 'Two extra cervical vertebrae.'

"'Also abnormally low vital signs (blood pressure, pulse). Not sure about
the placement of the organs either.'

"I looked at the helpless expression on my associate's face. 'Friend of
yours?'

"'The guy that just left to catch a flight to Switzerland.'

"I found myself looking down an empty hallway, far off into the
distance..."

In his book "LIGHT YEARS" (Morgan Entekin Books., Atlantic Monthly Press.,
N.Y. 1987), Gary Kinder reveals that the Swiss contactee Eduard 'Billy'
Meier was told by the star travelers he allegedly encountered that 'they'
were from the Pleiades, some 430 light-years from earth. The Pleiades are a
relatively nearby 'open' star cluster consisting of hundreds of stars, and
according to scientists the sun (or Sol) itself and some of its neighbors
revolve around Alcyon, the central star of the Pleiades cluster. However,
the Pleiades are a relatively young system of stars which are unlikely to
have developed life of their own and, in fact, the Pleiadeans claim that
they are not native to that part of the galaxy. The Pleiadeans claimed to
have 'terra-formed' certain planets in that sector to support life and that
their actual place of origin IS MUCH CLOSER TO EARTH, in the Lyra systems,
some 30-or-so light years from our Sol-ar system. In other words, they
migrated outwards from the general direction of the earth.

The Pleiadeans according to Meier look remarkably, almost exactly, like us
although many of them are allegedly 'Nordic' appearing, some with blonde
hair and others with darker shades. They number only a little more than 500
million on their Terra- formed planet of Erra, in the 'Taygeta' system of
the Pleiades. This suggests that they have probably been living on that
planet for a relatively short period of time as compared with the
inhabitants of the earth, who number over 7 billion.

'They' also claim to have horses, cows, rabbits, fish, and other 'Terran'
life-forms roaming about on their planet. This strongly suggests that the
ancestrage of the Lyran-Pleiadeans and those on earth are intimately linked
via ancient civilization, and in fact Meier was told that 'their' ancient
lineage does in fact converge with that of earth's ancient inhabitants.
When we consider that the Pleiadeans originally came from Lyra, which is
much closer to planet earth, and consider the remarkable similarities
between terran and Lyran-Pleiadean life, then one might wonder if Lyra
itself might have been originally colonized by ancient explorers such as
the Hav-musuvs, or by other civilizations such as the Mayas, Greeks,
Chinese or Eastindians who according to many sources all possessed aerial
and/or interplanetary exploratory craft a few thousand years ago. There is
incidentally ANOTHER GROUP of 'extraterrestrials' who have made themselves
known to various contactees and who claim to be tied-in with the Pleiadeans
AND ancient earth, suggesting an even greater possibility that these as
well as the Pleiadeans had their genesis originally on (ancient) earth
thousands of years ago. Could planet earth be the original 'seed' from
which all sentient life in the universe proceeded?

To be honest, there have been many claims -- mostly through so-called
"channeled" information -- which would have us to believe that the Earth
was originally colonized by beings from other worlds. We are of the
opposite opinion, however, and suggest that much of the inhabited sectors
of this galaxy were colonized by the many expeditions which, "unofficial"
history tells us, were sent outward from earth by several hidden societies
who had attained the ability to initiate interplanetary or interstellar
travel throughout the past 3 or 4 thousand years, in post-diluvian times.
The "other side" in this argument may present all the evidence they can
gather to support their theory, however they must allow us the same
privilage. We feel that if we are to suggest that planet earth was the
original life-seed of the galaxy, then we have the duty to compile the
evidence to support this theory, so most if not all of the information
contained in these files is information which we have gathered in support
of the above thesis and we make no apologies.

We present this possibility not because of any egotistical desire to place
planet earth above any other 'world', but simply because it seems to be the
one explanation which fits with all of the accounts given in this File.
This 'other' spacefaring group who are allegedly tied-in with the
Pleiadeans claim to come from the Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridanus star
systems, which are two of the nearest SOL-type star systems in this sector
of the galaxy.

According to Meier, a great interplanetary battle and mass human exodus
took place ages ago within the Lyran system, and as a result a large
percent of the human inhabitants were forced to evacuate their planet
within that system after many of their ancestors were apparently killed in
the war. Meier was not told, to our knowledge, just who the 'attackers'
were, but another 'contactee' claims that the attackers in the 'Lyran wars'
were none other than the interstellar parasites known to us as the 'Grays'.
Some who have been abducted against their will by the grays have even been
shown holographic recordings of such an interplanetary war, as if the grays
in their leviathan pride were parading their supposed invincibility to
their frightened and confused abductees.
