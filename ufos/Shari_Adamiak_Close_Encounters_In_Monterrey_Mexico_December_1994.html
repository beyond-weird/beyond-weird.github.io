CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FIFTH KIND IN MONTERREY, 
           MEXICO - DECEMBER 1994
    
          By Shari Adamiak ©1995
             Executive Director of CSETI

Introduction:

The following is an account - from my point of view - 
of events that occurred during a CSETI investigative 
team activation to Monterrey, Mexico in Decemer of 
1994.  While necessarily somewhat subjective based 
on my own experiences, every attempt has been made 
to present an accurate depiction of events that were 
experienced by myself and our team.

CSETI Reacts to Flap in Mexico:

After seeing a tape of a "Hard Copy" program 
showing an active wave of UFO activity in 
Monterrey, Mexico - the third largest metropolis 
in Mexico - we made an effort to contact the 
researcher who had taken those videos.  Santiago 
Yturria is a thorough researcher and skilled 
videographer who, along with Diana Perla Chapa, 
the host of a popular live talk show on Mexican 
network television, has had a UFO group for over 
20 years in the state of Nuevo Leone.
	
Dr. Steven Greer, international director of CSETI, 
activated a CSETI Rapid Mobilization Investigative 
Team (RMIT) to Monterrey to investigate this current 
flap.  Santiago, Diana, and the entire Ovni Club of
N.L. assisted us, took us to sites, shared their 
evidence and graciously welcomed us to Monterrey.  
Dr. Greer, myself, a woman from New York and a man, 
also a videographer, from Minneapolis made up the 
CSETI team. (Names furnished upon request.)

Consciousness Connections:

Lucid dream activity played a significant role 
in the events that unfolded in Monterrey.  Three 
of the team had dreams that proved to be portents 
of happenings on this project.  I had a dream in 
the early hours of December 13th.  In it, the 
extraterrestrials were showing us the spot where 
we should come in order to have a meeting with 
them.  They showed me aerial views, in stop 
motion - each one closer to the ground - and 
marked the site with a strobing turquoise laser 
pattern.  They showed me a view from the ground, 
looking up at some steep peaks, and showed it to 
me both in day and nighttime views.  The night 
view revealed two stars in a particular 
configuration over one of the peaks.

That very afternoon, Santiago and his friends drove 
us to Las Mitres mountains, well known as an area 
of many sightings of UFOs. As we approached, it 
dawned on me that it was identical to what I was 
shown in my dream. We decided to use the spot as 
our field research site that night.  When we came 
to Las Mitres (so named because the mountain peaks 
resemble a bishop's miter hat) that night, the two 
stars were indeed in the sky in the same position 
as I had seen in my lucid dream.

The Team Gets to Work:

The CSETI team had observed some anomalous objects 
in the sky at two different sites on the nights of 
December 11th and 12th, but the next two nights, 
the 13th and 14th at the Las Mitres sites, proved 
to be exceptional. The Las Mitres mountains contain 
a large cave where the local investigators believe 
that spacecraft conceal themselves when coming to
the Monterrey area.  And, unusually dense low
clouds were known to form over the cave and other 
parts of the peaks very quickly.  On the night of 
December 13th, the entire CSETI team set up camp at 
the base of Las Mitres. We were joined by an 
American woman who was a friend of one of our 
teammates, who was married to a Mexican man and 
living in Monterrey.  She had arranged our lodging 
and transportation for us.

Around 10:30 pm, following our first Coherent 
Thought Sequencing (a CSETI protocol) session, we 
observed a very bright light that appeared in the 
zenith of the sky, traveling rapidly in an upward 
arc that terminated in the center of the constellation
Orion.  At 10:45 pm, very dense clouds materialized 
within a minute on parts of the sheer mountain cliffs.

The Close Encounters Begin:

At approximately 1:00 am, Dr. Greer and another team 
member were standing slightly down the gravel road 
when they observed a bright, strobe-like white light 
to appear at the edge of the mountain.  At about the 
same time, I had gotten up and walked closer towards 
the brush at the base of the mountain.  Dr. Greer 
looked for me to tell me of the strobe light and 
found me at the spot where it had appeared.  As we 
stood there, another round light came rolling down 
the side of the steep slope.  Just then, I felt some 
invisible energy that felt as if it were gently 
pulling me in deeper to the brush.  Both Dr. Greer 
and I felt there was a presence nearby that, from 
past experience, led us to feel there was a 
spacecraft and extraterrestrial beings very nearby.

Just then, I began to perceive small, square-
shouldered beings in the brush around us. They could 
be sensed and dimly seen, but a clear view of them 
wasn't possible.  The little beings were extremely 
shy and reticent.  They would scurry close to us, 
then backtrack quickly into the brush.  We could not 
hear any brush moving or footsteps but we could dimly 
see them.  To me, they seemed to have on uniforms 
that covered their body and legs that were a dull
orange-rust color. They were very short, just up to 
my knees (I am 5'7").  I became aware of a telepathic 
message - they were concerned about our video camera, 
behind me to the right.  I turned my head and looked.  
Sure enough, unknown to me previously as I had not 
seen it in the dark, was our teammate's professional
camera set up on a tripod.  I send back the mental 
message to them not to worry, the camera wasn't on 
and we wouldn't let him touch it.  They seemed to 
trust my assurance, as the event continued to unfold.  
I related this two-way communication to Dr. Greer, 
who went back to the other three people and 
instructed them to stay where they were unless he 
called them forward.
	
These rich, rare exchanges with what appear to be 
extraterrestrial life forms are very delicate 
scenarios.  Any sudden, rash or extreme emotion or 
movement can thwart the entire event and bring it 
to a screeching halt, and the extraterrestrials 
vanish.  Sometimes our second-guessing of what is 
needed to allow an event to unfold in all its 
possible fullness is accurate; sometimes it is not. 
It is almost like hesitant dance partners, longing 
but afraid to get closer.  Until we as a people are 
more accepting of close contact with extraterrestrials, 
our interactions are likely to continue in this way.
     
I could mentally 'hear' concerned conversation going 
on amongst the small beings. They eventually conveyed 
to me the message, again mentally, that they were 
having difficulty adjusting our energies in 
preparation for a meeting because my physical energy 
was concentrated on my stomach, trying to digest some 
food.  Just before all this began, I had eaten about 
a half of a Power Bar, a dense protein energy food.  
It was cold and hard from being in my gear bag for 
hours and I could feel it kind of just laying in my 
stomach.  At this point, I sent a very deliberate 
message to the life forms:  "I give you permission 
to take it out of my body".  Suddenly, I felt as if 
someone were standing some distance away with a
fishing line whose hook was inside my stomach. It 
felt as if someone were slowing reeling in the line 
as the food came back out the way it went in.  Now, 
I detest vomiting more than almost anything and I 
was struck by the gentleness that was used in 
removing this food from my body. It was only mildly 
unpleasant.  Dr. Greer, an emergency physician, 
asked me if I was alright.  I told him that I was 
fine and that this was being done with my permission.  
After this little purging, the energy felt softer, 
with less intense vibration.
     
Soon the little beings sent both Dr. Greer and I the 
message that if we removed our glasses, we would be 
able to see them better. Although I normally use 
contact lenses, glasses are preferable for field 
work when wind and dust often gets blown into my 
eyes, plus the fact that we are often in the field 
until the wee hours of the morning.  After receiving 
this message, we each removed our glasses.  One last 
request from the little ETs - that we remove our hats 
(it had been a chilly night.)  At this point, I could
actually feel a harmonious flow of energy between us, 
the little beings, and some other unseen source.

Another Being is Perceived:

At this point, the small life forms disappeared.
Shafts of golden light began to come from an unknown, 
unseen source and lay across the bushes in front of 
us.  We learned later that the three other team 
members behind us could see this as well, although 
they had not been able to perceive the small beings.  
I could feel one of these shafts of light approach me 
and fill my torso with a warm, golden glow.  After 
the light rays faded, a large oval of bluish fog began 
to form about ten feet in front of us.  As the blue
mist began to coalesce, Dr. Greer and I became aware 
of a being within it.  Although again we could see him
only dimly, he appeared very humanoid, tall, with long 
and straight silverish hair.  He appeared to be clothed 
in a light blue and silver uniform.

We learned later that one team member saw a tendril 
of the blue fog travel along the ground towards her.  
It frightened her a little until the mist reached her 
foot and began to send wisps around her feet.  She 
later told us that there was a gentle kindness about 
the fog and all misgivings vanished.  However, our
American friend who was not an actual team member 
became very frightened by the golden light and blue 
fog.

We learned later that it was all too much for her - 
something the extraterrestrial would tell us.  For as 
we stood there facing one another, the tall being 
sent us a message that they would very much like to 
manifest more fully in the physical to meet with us, 
but that if they did so, one of our team members would 
be dangerously frightened.  Their caution and concern 
were touching. And a far cry from the crying wolf that
goes on so often when extraterrestrials are said to be 
heartless, devoid of feeling, and out to harm human 
beings.  We in CSETI feel that this type of encounter 
points up the absolute need and appropriateness of 
doing real-time field work in our efforts to learn 
exactly what these beings are all about.
	 
It is important, and interesting, to note that both 
Dr. Greer and myself received nearly identical mental 
messages each time there was a communication from the 
extraterrestrial.

Dr. Greer and I consulted one another and decided to 
send a joint message.  We told the tall being that if 
they could not come to us, it was okay with us if they 
could take us to where they were.  We could sense this 
was being discussed with a 'central command control', 
or his more senior team members.  Dr. Greer and I saw 
a copper-gold sphere, ten to twelve feet in diameter, 
begin to coalesce to the left of the tall being.  It 
never reached material solidity but soon began to 
disperse. The tall being then sent us a message that 
it would frighten our teammates just as much to see us 
disappear in front of their eyes as it would for the 
ETs to manifest right there.  At this time, we had no 
idea that any member of our team was having difficulty 
coping with these events.

Soon Again, Soon Again:

Finally, after what seemed like a few moments, the 
tall being sent us a message that they would not be 
able to manifest fully in the physical this night.  
But they sent a message: "soon again; soon again".  
At this point, Dr. Greer went back to speak with the 
other team members and I stayed put.  For the next 
five minutes, the being and I exchanged blessings to
each other, to our teams.  It was poignant and lovely.  
I cannot recall any of the actual 'words' or specific 
communications; it was not a left-brained exchange, 
but was beyond the bounds of linear thought.

Their Reluctance is Proven Out:

When I joined the others, I learned that our American 
friend had become extremely frightened, so much so 
that she had taken refuge in our vehicle.  We had 
designated the big Suburban as the 'safe area".  We 
do this on all our field research - setting aside a 
specific enclosure that any team member can go to if
unfolding events prove fearful to them.  In fact, it 
is our policy to send a 'buddy' along, who remains with 
them the entire time they wish to stay in the safe area.  
We divide into buddies at the beginning of our field 
session so that each team member is accounted for, and
accountable, at all times.  She told us that if she had 
seen anything more from the ETs, she would have run 
screaming down the mountainside.

Preparation is Key:

Her reactions impressed upon us the importance of 
training for each team member. It served as a strong 
reminder to us to be more stringent in adherence to our 
policies regarding untrained guests who wanted to join 
our field work.

Much to my surprise, Dr. Greer and I learned from our 
teammates that we had been standing there, exchanging 
communication with the extraterrestrials, for nearly 
two hours. We both thought no more than thirty minutes
had elapsed.  By this time, it was nearly 3:00 am, so 
we broke camp and went home.

The Encounters Continue:

The following day was a busy one with an appearance 
on Diana Chapa's live TV show in the morning, a field 
trip to another site in the afternoon, and a talk at 
the Ovni Club that evening.  It was about 11:30 pm 
by the time we were driving up the narrow road to our
Las Mitres site.

Interestingly, our videographer teammate was absent 
from field work.  He had decided to stay in the city to 
visit his friend and her son.  As the Suburban headed 
up the gravel lane, Dr. Greer and I simultaneously
observed a small, bright light on the side of Las
Mitres.  We knew from the previous night that there 
was no light normally in that area. Tonight we also had 
with us our American friend's Mexican husband.  He and 
our driver assured us there were no houses, no power
lines, no roads, nothing on the sheer cliffs of Las
Mitres.
	
As we came to the base of the mountain, Dr. Greer 
jumped from the Suburban while it was still rolling.  
The other woman and I jumped out and grabbed the bare 
necessities of field gear:  a 500,000 candle power 
portable halogen light, our night vision scope, 
binoculars, a small camcorder, and a hand-held micro-
cassette recorder.
	
Because of the reaction by an untrained participant 
the previous night, we sent our driver and his friend 
down the road.  We told them we could not afford any 
panic this night.  Unbeknownst to us at the time, the 
men went to a spot at the bottom of the road where they 
could clearly see the events that unfolded.

Are We in a Spielberg Movie?:

Dr. Greer grabbed the halogen light and sent a signal 
to the star-like light on the hillside.  Instantly, the 
light transformed into a gigantic, brilliant round beam 
that shot light down the entire mountainside!  We were 
astonished.  It came close to being the time we always 
joke about - when events are so incredible that we'll
wish we had on "Depends" undergarments!  We continued to 
have a Close Encounter of the Fifth Kind - a human-
initiated or human-interactive experience - with this 
craft for the next two hours and fifteen minutes.  An
exchange like this, with a team in the field, is 
unprecedented.

During the lengthy encounter, we sent light signals to 
the craft.  The craft would signal back to us in the 
exact same sequence.  Then its lights would extinguish.  
Within a few minutes, it would again illuminate and 
initiate a signal to us.  This went on and on.  Twice 
during this time period, we saw the shadows of beings
walking in front of the blinding beam.  At times, the 
beam would rotate upon itself, appearing to the left of 
its original position - then back where it was.  Once 
the light seemed to turn over on itself, illuminating 
the sparsely forested slope behind it.  This was one 
of the times when figures were seen to move in the beam.

Hoaxability Ration - Low to Zero:

It must be emphasized that this is a very remote area 
devoid of roads.  For anyone to have hoaxed this event 
would have required something on the scale of a major 
motion picture crew.  There was simply no way to have
moved equipment like this onto these sheer slopes.  
It would have caused quite a commotion in the suburbs 
below if a crew of that magnitude had traversed those 
sheer cliffs that day.  The area would have been 
swarming with lookie-loos.

At the end of the two hours and fifteen minutes, the 
light, which by now had split into two candle-flame 
colored round lights, turned to brilliant red, shot 
out a lightning bolt of energy and vanished.  We saw 
a golden streak shoot through the sky towards the 
direction of the ancient volcano, Topochico.  And the 
energy was gone.  It was not until this point that we 
fully appreciated that 1) we'd been standing up for 
all that time, and 2) our hair had stood on end the 
entire time.  As a side note, I want to report that 
when we first got out of the vehicle at the base of 
the mountain, I heard crickets chirping in 
stereophonic synchronicity. One would chirp on our 
right, then one would chirp on our left.  The chirping 
was loud and distinct. When I heard it, I told my 
teammates that it was significant.  I had heard 
similar chirping prior to another major encounter in 
the past.  It was moments later that the gigantic 
craft illuminated before us.

Eventful Trip Home:

We signalled to our drivers to bring up the Suburban.  
When they arrived, we learned that the men had gone 
to a vantage point and had seen everything, giving us 
two independent witnesses.  In fact, from their extra 
distance the light was not so blinding and they were 
able to discern the craft.  They both reported seeing
a very large disc-shaped craft with a domed top.  The 
men were extremely excited.  They said they felt 
bonded now, like brothers.  The American's husband 
said that his life would never be the same again.
     
As we were riding on our 30-minute drive home, Dr. 
Greer remarked that he felt the ETs would follow us.  
Within a minute, the man in front was exclaiming, 
"la luz, la luz!" (the light, the light!)  We could 
then see that the gigantic light was visible from the 
road, showing itself to us on the opposite side of the 
mountain from where it had been at our field site!  We
stopped at a closed gas station, signalled and videoed 
(which came out fuzzy and blurred). You will recall 
that, of all nights, our videographer was not with us 
this night.  Coincidence or orchestrated by the ETs?   
So many such things happen that we have to ponder the
possibility.  This time, the light was not appearing 
as two lights side by side. Instead, they were two 
lights stacked one on top the other.  We continued to 
observe it on the remainder of the homeward ride, 
stopping twice more to observe.
     
When we arrived home, we climbed up to our flat roof.  
We could still see it, even though the entire valley 
of the city of Monterrey was now between us, the back 
side of Las Mitres and the rest of the range.  The 
lights were still there.  They had changed position 
again and were now staggered, one atop the other.  
They had been so bright that we could see the rock
face behind it illuminated.  As we watched, the lights 
dimmed down to about half their luminosity.

The Craft Revealed:

At this point, we could clearly see the structure of 
the craft.  It was indeed a large disc with a sloped 
dome on top.  By measuring with fingers at arm's length,
Dr. Greer determined that the craft was between one-half 
to one full city block in size.
     
As the birds began to sing and the sky began to lighten, 
we bid goodbye and heartfelt thanks to our visitors for 
these remarkable experiences and went inside to sleep, 
and dream of them.

Final Notes:  I wish to advise that the three persons 
who interacted with the craft as described above 
included three very responsible and stable individuals.  
Dr. Greer is a practicing trauma physician, father of 
four, world-renowned expert on extraterresrial 
intellignce.  He is the founder of CSETI, and the 
visionary and guiding force of it.  Our teammate from 
New York is cofounder of a research foundation, and is
personal friends with world leaders in both the 
political and private sectors.  And I myself have been 
educated in the sciences and the law and worked for 
many years as a paralegal, which gives me a logical 
mind upon which to base my ongoing extraterrestrial 
experiences.
