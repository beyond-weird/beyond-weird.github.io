think of them, but what appear to be wilderness observation platforms. The
Dulce Report denies any of these buildings appeared in their investigation.

(Opening Note: ParaNet has done an investigation into the PHOENIX
organization which put out this report. Contrary to the claims of the
authors of this document, ParaNet HAS FOUND obvious links between the
PHOENIX PROJECT and the PHOENIX REPORT, an outlet for the ASHTAR
Collective. One of the 'leaders' and 'spokesmen' for this collective is a
being that goes by the name of HATONN. Hatonn, according to some sources,
is a 9 ft. 'Pleiadean' with severe fascist leanings who claims to be a
reptilian 'defector' from the Unholy Six Orion-Draconian Empire. Other
sources claim that the Ashtar Collective -- or at least a large segment of
the collective which was infiltrated and assimilated by Draco-Orion agents
posing as "ascended masters" -- is now in direct collaboration with the
reptilian Grays and the 'Unholy Six'. In such an event, it would NOT be
surprising for the Draco-Orion controlled segment of the Ashtar network to
seek to discredit a base under Dulce, New Mexico IF IN FACT the base is
being controlled and operated jointly by Draconian AND Ashtarian forces...
for instance the joint Draconian-Ashtarian forces which, some believe, are
operating in conjuction with the anomalous "Hale-Bopp" comet. Since the
original document-chain in which the 'Dulce Report' appears contains over
140 KB's and is an obvious smear effort -- for instance throughout the
document you will read passage after passage containing phrases like
"...there is no evidence" for phenomena which HAVE been confirmed by
several other researchers -- I have decided not to waste valuable space,
and have eliminated the rambling and innocuous sweeping opinionated
attempts on the part of the authors to wipe the entire Dulce issue under
the carpet. I have instead gleaned the information which may be useful to
those who accept the obvious fact that 'something' is actually going on
near Dulce, New Mexico. Whether it involves top secret government activity
OR alien activity OR both is debatable. The fact is, something strange IS
happening in and around Dulce, New Mexico. - Branton)



The document begins as follows:



...The Town of Dulce, is located in northern New Mexico near the southern
border of Colorado. Dulce is located eighty-three miles northeast of
Farmington, New Mexico on U.S. Route 64. See Map Exhibit 1.



It has a population of 1,648 and is nestled in a valley. Just to the north
and overlooking the town is the large Archuleta Mesa. The town is at an
altitude of 6,825 feet above sea level. The main income producing activity
in the area is cattle ranching. The business and service activities are
typical of those needed in a community of this size. There are no military
or industrial activities, large or small, in the area. See Photo Exhibits 4
and 5.



In order to present the results of our investigation it is necessary to
refer to items of information, widely available to UFO researchers,
concerning the Dulce, U.S.\Alien base. In the following, we will quote from
those items of information. We will attempt to identify the source whenever
possible. This will be followed by our findings.





The Investigation



1) Source Information Excerpts: Dulce Papers.Txt Author Unknown



...A joint US/EBE facility exists beneath the Archuleta Mesa near the town
of DULCE NEW MEXICO. (1A) This facility has been in existence in one form
or another since 1948.



(1B) ...The facility proper is located one kilometer underground.



(1C) The base is approximately 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost
overlooks the town.



(1D) There is a paved government road 36 feet wide going into the area.



* * *



Findings of Phoenix Project Investigation (PHX) regarding the foregoing:



(PHX-1A) No substantiating County records confirm this. Local residents
have no memory of any government installation, civilian or military ever
having existed in this area.



(PHX-1B) Same as 1A. There is no record or memory of any underground heavy
construction, excavation, or mining activity in the area.



* * *



2) Source Information Excerpts: 1988 Krill2.Txt



...During the occupation of the Greys, they have established quite a number
of underground bases all over the world, especially in the United States.
(2A) One such base [among others in the same state] is under Archuleta
Mesa, which is about 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, New Mexico.



The foregoing extract is from a transcript of a conversation between Jim
McCampbell and Dr. Paul Bennewitz on July 13, 1984...



* * *



3) Source Information Excerpts: 1988 Krill2.Txt



(3A) ...Bennewitz reports he was able to determine the location of the
underground facility: a kilometer underground beneath Archuleta Mesa on the
Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation near Dulce, New Mexico [since 1976, one
of the areas of the U.S. hardest hit by mutilations]. (3B) Bennewitz'
information is that this installation is operated jointly as part of an
on-going program of cooperation between the U.S. government and the EBEs.

Back to the base under discussion. After Bennewitz briefed Air Force
officials on what he had found, a trip to the area revealed the following
data:



(3C) The base is 2.5 miles northwest of Dulce, and almost overlooks the
town. (3D) There is a level highway 36 feet wide going into the area. It is
a government road. (3E) One can see telemetry trailers and buildings that
are five-sided with a dome. Next to the domes, a black limousine was noted
-- a CIA vehicle. (3F) These limos will run you off the road if you try to
get into the area. (3G) To the north there is a launch site. (3H) There are
two wrecked ships there; they are 36 feet long with wings, and one can see
oxygen and hydrogen tanks. The ships that we got out of the trade are
atomic-powered with plutonium pellets. Refueling of the plutonium is
accomplished at Los Alamos. (3I) The base has been there since 1948.



Some of the disks are piloted by the NSA. (3J) The base is 4,000 feet long
(3K) and helicopters are going in and out of there all the time. When it
became known that Bennewitz was familiar with this, the mutilations in the
area stopped. (3L) In 1979, something happened and the base was temporarily
closed. There was an argument over weapons and our people were chased out.
The aliens killed 66 of our people, and 44 got away. (Side Note: Christa
Tilton claims that the government activity at Dulce may no longer be
present, as there are signs that the upper levels have been de-activated,
at least in regards to human government activity. Sightings of Greys atop
the Archuleta mesa HAVE been reported by Jicarilla Apache Indians as of the
early 1990's. Such reports have made their way to Christa Tilton,
suggesting that even if the 'government' activity at Dulce has ceased, the
Greys/Reptiloids are apparently still operating there en masse and very
active within the base, and are continuing on with their former agendas. -
Branton)



One of the people who in fact got away was a CIA agent who, before leaving,
made some notes, photos, and videotapes, and went into hiding. He has been
in hiding ever since, and every six months he contacts each of five people
he left copies of the material with. His instructions were that if he
missed four successive contacts, the people could do whatever they want
with the material. [The material] was received in December, 1987, by many
researchers. The "Dulce Papers" were composed of 25 black and white photos,
a videotape with no dialogue and a set of papers that included technical
information regarding the jointly occupied [CIA-Alien] facility one
kilometer beneath the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. (3M) The
facility still exists and is currently operational.



* * *



Findings: (I've deleted SEVERAL paragraphs which basically state -- in the
most technical sounding terminology the authors could conjure -- that ALL
of the above "doesn't exist". - Branton)...



* * *



4) Source Information Excerpts: "PROJECT BETA" BY DR. PAUL BENNEWITZ



(4A)...numerous road blocks extend northward. (4B) Maintained road some
thirty feet wide and servicing facilities, tanks, etc. There is also an
apparent foundation for another helo pad______

(4C) human housing, and another black limousine with tracks leading to it
west of the road.



...The total alien basing area apparently contains several cultures, [all
under the designation 'UNITY'] (4D) and is approx 3km wide by 8km long and
is located in the middle of nowhere on the Jicarilla Indian Reservation
west of Dulce, NM. ...Based on the number of ships presently in this area,
the total alien population is estimated to be at least 2,000 and most
likely MORE. (The former self-professed Dulce base Security Officer Thomas
C. Castello stated that there were over 18,000 Greys based under Dulce
while he was there. - Branton)



----- Logistical plans -----



...initial logistics would indicate a plan sequentially implemented as
follows: This plan does not include all requirements and preparatory safety
measures to be employed by the ground force; however, if Air Force
Intelligence desires to pursue the approaches suggested in this report,
each significant requirement will be discussed in depth.



(4E) The attack must be directed almost entirely on the ground since
vehicle ignition problems will be encountered. All electrical and
electronic equipment must be 'hardened' using specific techniques perfected
prior to implementation. This information has been checked by interaction
and eavesdropping on their communication channels _______ as far as
weaknesses are concerned. The program would be instigated in phases:



(4F)

1) The first procedure would be to close the gates of the dam above the
Navajo River. This dam could be held closed for the duration. Internal to
the one cave, there is a small dam for water storage. Its capacity is
small.



(4G) There is also a discharge outlet downstream that could be closed,
causing waste water to back up into the caves. The water is vacuum pumped
apparently by some electrostatic means from the river. (4H) There is a
water intake and dam upstream that can be totally cut off and the water
re-routed to Chama, New Mexico.

rambling evasiveness. However if you really ARE determined to see the
entire file, I suppose you could log-on to PARANET via the Internet and

Michael,



Didn't Bill Moore get tangled up in this situation? Didn't this whole
episode cause Paul Bennewitz to have a nervous breakdown? Do you have any
further documentation on this aspect of the investigation? I for one would
like to find out where some [if not all] of the disinformation came from.
Are there any other investigations "The Phoenix Project" is working on?



Thanks,

Rod

First, that was not my work, nor did I have anything to do with it. Someone
uploaded that material to ParaNet and I simply reposted it with permission.
I have found numerous problems with it myself and, although I do not
necessarily believe that something is happening at Dulce, I think that the
Phoenix material is just more disinformation...

Recently we published two reports generated by the Phoenix Project, a group
in Carson City, Nevada. These two documents allege that members of this
group investigated reports of underground alien bases in Dulce, New Mexico,
and an underground alien base located in the Plumas National Forest in
Northern California. (Note: Basically their investigation 'proved' that the
Dulce base did NOT exist, but that the 'K2' UFO base in California DID! Why
do I get the feeling that IF the K2 base DOES in fact exist, then we should
not be too concerned about it? Could it be that there is an actual alien
force based in the Plumes National Forest that is CONTESTING the activities
at Dulce? Just remember that for every visible conflict, there is often an
invisible conflict taking place behind the scenes. Often the 'pawns' cannot
see who the real "chess players" are. - Branton)



Because of the following findings/reasons, ParaNet has assigned a high
level of probability that the material contained in the documents is
disinformation and is inaccurate.



The reasons are as follows:



1) The Phoenix Project is unknown to the general UFO research community. No
where in any of the materials are the principals of the organization
identified. As is the case with any materials where substantive findings
are reported, it demonstrates a strong lack of credibility when the names
and addresses of the investigators are not provided.



2) Due to an investigation that has been ongoing, we have found that the
material on Dulce is inaccurate. It is interesting that the Dulce report
denies that ANYTHING exists at Dulce. Although we have found no information
to the contrary, we feel that the report from the Phoenix Project is
inaccurate as to location of buildings and other factors. There are things
down there which ARE unusual.



3) The K2 material is too ambiguous and does not provide enough reliable
data bits to launch an investigation into the claims. It appears that
although the report is written with some literary license, the findings are
presented in a very unscientific fashion.



ParaNet will provide a complete report of its investigation into the
various other claims contained in the reports as soon as the information is
available. We have written to the Phoenix Project requesting further
information.



In the meantime, we urge caution in the use of this material.

Over the last few days we have been posting information supplied by the
Phoenix Project of Carson City, Nevada. This information has been strongly
disclaimed by ParaNet pending the results of our investigation to determine
the validity of the Phoenix Project and its officers.



While the investigation is still ongoing, we have found some highly
disturbing things relating to credibility of the group. This information
will be reported as soon as the investigation is completed. This should be
in the next few days.



Until this investigation is complete and the findings published, ParaNet
wishes to urge everyone not to send any money to the group.

A few weeks ago, ParaNet received on-line copies of several documents which
purported to come from a previously unknown organization called "The
Phoenix Project". The project is described in the documents as a "private,
civilian, research organization" which was "formed in 1952 to investigate
and correlate information" concerning UFOs and ETs. According to the
information contained in the documents, for a small price one can receive
printed copies of the project's reports, complete with maps, magnetometer
readings, and a host of other supporting charts and diagrams which serve to
make the whole endeavor look scientific and legitimate.



The documents we received were formulated as investigative reports on two
of the hottest and most controversial issues within the UFO research
community: the underground alien bases which are said to exist at numerous
locations around the United States, and the cluster of alleged UFO-related
projects sometimes referred to collectively as "Operation Majestic Twelve".
Specifically, the material consisted of three separate documents:



(1) "The Ultimate Secret", originally dated 4 August 1989 and revised most
recently 5 May 1992, purporting to lay bare the inner workings of the
government's secret UFO projects, including the recovery of alien
technology and bodies from crashed UFOs, the exploitation of this
technology by a number of code-named government projects, and the
involvement of NASA and the SDI program in preparing for CONFLICT with
alien INVADERS;



(2) "The Dulce Report", dated 27 May 1992, describing an on-site
investigation of the Dulce and Archuleta Mesa area in New Mexico, which
purportedly proved beyond any doubt that there is nothing there of any
interest to UFO researchers despite PERSISTENT reports to the contrary; and



(3) "The K-2 Report", originally dated 28 July 1989 and revised 27 June
1992, which purports to document the discovery of a genuine "secret alien
base" in the Pilot Peak area of Plumas County, California.



ParaNet quickly reviewed this material and posted it in its entirety for
our subscribers, pursuant to the permissions attached to the material by
the publisher. We also posted a preliminary evaluation which warned that
the material might contain inaccuracies or deliberate disinformation. This
evaluation was based on a number of factors:



(1) much of the information in "The Ultimate Secret" about Operation
Majestic Twelve and associated projects is clearly related to, and probably
derived from, earlier material which has been dismissed as worthless by
almost all reputable UFO researchers;



(2) much of the information in "The Dulce Report" about Dulce and the
Archuleta Mesa contradicts information already provided to ParaNet by other
capable investigators;



(3) some of the information in "The K-2 Report" is intrinsically
implausible [although, admittedly, not impossible], such as the claim that
a seasoned military intelligence operative 'forgot' his camera when rushing
to document a UFO landing site, or that by the next day that same landing
site had been re-sodded by the aliens to obliterate all the evidence.



ParaNet received the three documents as uploads from a Mr. Jack L. Mathias
of Carson City, Nevada, who represented himself as the sole public
spokesman for the Project. But the reports themselves name neither the
authors of the documents nor the principals of the Phoenix Project.
Instead, they cryptically state that they are the work of "former military
personnel who have all been associated with intelligence activities, and
have knowledge of covert government operations concerning UFO's" (AND also
'disinformation' projects? - Branton). Given the sorry history of anonymous
documents and 'former' government agents in the UFO community, ParaNet felt
it necessary to start its own investigation in an effort to determine just
who was behind the Phoenix Project and what their motives might be.



First we sent a letter to the post office box listed in the documents,
asking for further information about the group; but the letter was not
answered. We corresponded by electronic mail with Mr. Mathias, who
represents himself as an agent for the group, but he refused to provide any
of the information we requested. So much for the direct approach.



Each document formally states that the Phoenix Project logo is a registered
trademark [presumably in the state of Nevada, since that is where their
mailing address is located], so we tried a query to the Nevada trademark
office in Carson City. That office informed us that the state of Nevada has
NO record of any current trademarks under the "Phoenix Project" name. They
did say that articles of incorporation were filed under the name of the
Phoenix Project on 25 August 1988 by a Mr. Thomas Naylor of Las Vegas,
Nevada. However, the corporation failed to file the names and addresses of
its officers by 1 July 1989 as required by Nevada law, as a result of which
the incorporation was revoked by the Nevada Secretary of State. And so we
reached another apparent dead end, except for one bit of trivia uncovered
by a ParaNet investigator in Las Vegas: An attorney named Thomas C. Naylor
had recently moved into an office building at 2810 West Charleston in Las
Vegas.



Next we contacted the U.S. Postal Service in Carson City, Nevada to
determine the box holder for the Phoenix Project's publisher, Advent
Publishing Company. We were told that the box was registered to a Richard
T. Miller, whose address was given as a mobile-home park in Carson City.
Following this, we contacted the Clerk and Recorder's office in Carson
City, and determined that a Richard Miller is listed with them as the legal
owner of Advent Publishing. However, the telephone number they gave us for
Mr. Miller has been disconnected, and directory assistance was unable to
provide a new one. Another brick wall.



To this point, all attempts to verify the Phoenix Project's legitimacy
using conventional methods had proved futile, so we decided to try a
different approach. The Phoenix Project explicitly and emphatically
disclaims affiliation with any other groups using the name 'Phoenix'. And
just to make sure everyone gets the message, each document states at the
beginning that "[i]n particular, there is no affiliation with a publisher
known as America West, any of its publications, or the individuals known as
George and Desiree Green" (Note: one source has informed us that George
Green has ties to the CIA. However, this source was not able to confirm
this claim, and so it should be taken only as a 'possibility'. - Branton).
Unfortunately, ParaNet has uncovered evidence that these disclaimers may be
intended to conceal rather than to illuminate.



America West, it turns out, is the publisher of a magazine called the
Phoenix Liberator, which carries large quantities of channeled material
alleged to originate with an entity from the Pleiades known as 'Hatonn'.
The Phoenix Liberator has come under fire recently from some in the UFO
community as anti-Semitic and neo-fascist. [See, for example, "Hatonn's
World: A Neo-Nazi ET?" by Don Ecker in the July/August 1992 issue of UFO
Magazine.] (Note: According to the video 'SECRETS OF THE THIRD REICH' --
available via Vladimir Terziski, President, American Academy of Dissident
Sciences, 10970 Ashton Ave. #310, Los Angeles, CA 90024, phone and fax:
USA-(310)-473-9717 -- the Nazi Thule society not only 'channeled' the
Ashtar forces, but had developed several aerial disc designs, photographs
of which are depicted in the film. One disc type was the 'Adamski' model.
Whether Adamski's contacts were actually 'Nazis' masquerading as
'Venusians', or whether the Nazi's had somehow gained access to a
Venusian-Pleiadean scout ship is not clear at this time, however John Lear
has stated that a small renegade 'Pleiadean' faction in Aldebaran which had
sold itself over to the Ashtarian-Draconian agenda, had intentionally
'crashed' one of their ships -- loaded to the hilt with high-tech equipment
-- so that they could get the technology to their Germanic/Bavarian allies
while at the same time making an effort to seemingly by-pass the
established non-intervention laws of the
Saturnian-Lyran-Pleiadean-Andromedan 'Federation'. Lear also claims that
this Pleiadean-Ashtarian faction also wanted Germany to initiate a war
which hopefully would reduce the population of the planet to a point where
the Ashtar/Gizeh alliance or collective could establish more influence with
less resistance in the international affairs of planet earth... this
collaboration with the Bavarians also being motivated by certain extremist
Interventionist and RACIST factions from Lyra and Aldebaran who were intent
on making their 'Aryan' brothers on earth the dominant race. - Branton).
But 'Hatonn' and his defenders vehemently deny the charge [of being
'Nazis'], and the whole affair has been widely and rather nastily trumpeted
both on the net and in print.



It seems that until recently America West Publishers and the Phoenix
Liberator were operated out of TEHACHAPI, California (Which, according to
many investigative sources, is a MAJOR center for collaborative alien and
military-industrial activity - Branton). But a few days ago one of
ParaNet's subscribers uploaded a response from 'Hatonn' to Don Ecker, which
he said he had pulled down from the Phoenix Liberator BBS; and with it he
posted a new address for the Liberator. That address was all too familiar:
2810 West Charleston Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada -- THE SAME BUILDING, it
seems, where an attorney named Thomas Naylor also has his new office.



And then another strange coincidence: A posting coming across the Internet
stated that before 'Hatonn' channeled through his current host, he used to
convey his messages through a Mr. RICHARD MILLER, who started an
organization which was known as the Solar Cross and which was apparently a
forerunner of the Phoenix Liberator (Note: These 'channeled' messages are
apparently recieved through psionic beams from hovering craft which
interact with micro-electronic implants that have been placed in various
individuals who have been 'connected' to the Ashtar collective in this
manner. - Branton). Is this the same RICHARD MILLER who owns the Phoenix
Project's publisher, Advent Publishing Company?



We do not yet know if the THOMAS NAYLOR who tried to incorporate the
Phoenix Project is the same THOMAS NAYLOR who apparently SHARES 2810 West
Charleston with the new offices of the Phoenix Liberator. We do not yet
know if the RICHARD MILLER who owns Advent Publishing is the same RICHARD
MILLER who reportedly once channeled 'Hatonn'. In short, we do not yet know
if the Phoenix Project is truly an independent organization, or merely
another incarnation of America West Publishers and the Phoenix Liberator.
But the coincidences are certainly striking and suggestive. And in light of
this we again urge extreme caution in dealing with the Phoenix Project
material, until such time as a definitive assessment of the Project's
motives and reliability can be made.



ParaNet will keep you advised of our findings as they become available. If
you have any information about the Phoenix Project, especially regarding
its possible relationship with the Phoenix Liberator or America West
Publishers, please send it to Michael Corbin by Internet mail to

* Forwarded from "ParaNet UFO Echo"

* Originally from ParaNet Information Service

* Originally dated 08-20-92 13:23



On 6 August 1992, ParaNet Information Service posted a preliminary
statement on our investigation into an organization known as the Phoenix
Project, which had recently released "investigative reports" entitled "The
Dulce Report", "The K-2 Report", and "The Ultimate Secret". In our
statement we pointed out some apparent problems with all three Phoenix
Project reports, as well as some suspicious aspects of the Project's
organization itself. In our conclusion, we issued a warning not to take the
Phoenix Project reports at face value, pending further investigation.



On 10 August 1992, Jack Mathias of the Phoenix Project responded in a long,
rambling message posted to a number of bulletin boards and news groups.
Unfortunately, rather than dealing with the substantive issues raised in
our previous postings regarding the project and its publications, Mr.
Mathias's statement consisted mostly of ad-hominem attacks impugning the
motives, integrity, and competence of ParaNet's officers and investigators.
Here is some typical language excerpted from the Phoenix Project statement:



" ... you blew it ..."

" ... a snap judgement without examining the evidence ..."

" ... your spontaneous and instant negative reaction ..."

" ... your attitude problem ..."

" ... you abused your position of trust and responsibility ..."

" ... inexcusable ... a new record for prejudice ..."

" ... you've just won the Golden Fleece Award ..."

" ... outstanding ineptness ..."

" ... amateur sleuthing ..."

" ... self-centered ..."

" ... lacking any real expertise ..."

" ... seated upon your starry throne ..."

" ... elected yourself to be the final arbiter of the truth ..."

" ... Judge, Jury, and Executioner ..."

" ... Kangaroo Court Proceeding of your own fashioning ..."

" ... arm-chair expertise ..."

" ... laughable ..."



Following paragraph after paragraph of this kind of personal invective, Mr.
Mathias then suggests that:



PP> In our opinion, the public deserves the truth regarding the real

PP> story of UFO's, government involvement and the Alien threat.

PP> That should be our objective. ... Perhaps you'll agree that, that

PP> objective is more productive than entertaining the public via the

PP> BBS links with a side-show of petty squabbles and bickering

PP> between individuals and organizations.



This is a noble sentiment, and one which we at ParaNet wholeheartedly agree
with. Hopefully in the future the Phoenix Project's representatives will
take some of their own advice and try to keep the rhetoric down to a more
civilized level.



Having said that, let's look at the actual issues raised by this latest
salvo from the Phoenix Project, and see how they stack up.



PP> Let us review the facts. You reacted by issuing a public warning

PP> to the members of ParaNet, which was also widely distributed via

PP> other BBS's nation-wide. That warning contained language which

PP> implied the information, and the source, were highly suspect.

PP> Thus, single-handedly, you created a strong impression throughout

PP> the UFO community, that our information was false. Many sincere

PP> people, trusting your qualifications, accepted your warning.



True.



PP> You took it upon yourself to make a snap judgement without

PP> examining the evidence.



False. We did not arrive at our conclusion single-handedly or
instantaneously. Our analysis and the resulting warning were the products
of considerable discussion among ParaNet's researchers and subscribers.
They were also labeled as tentative, pending further investigation.



PP> In your message, you mention that you wrote to the Phoenix Project,

PP> after the fact and your preliminary judgement, requesting further

PP> information. You made the same comment in other BBS messages.

PP> You state that we did not respond to your request. You also imply,

PP> by insinuation, that this is a mark against us and a further indication

PP> that we are suspect. ... To date we have not received your letter of

PP> inquiry. Apparently, of all the mail we receive, your letter is the

PP> only one that has gone astray. We can only conclude that it was either

PP> lost in the mail or you didn't mail it. Did it ever occur to you to

PP> mail us a second request, when you did not receive a response to your

PP> first inquiry?



The letter was followed up with electronic mail to the Project's spokesman,
Jack Mathias. The request for information was repeated through that
channel. The request was refused.



PP> But, this was not the end of your attitude problem regarding the

PP> Phoenix Project. You did the same thing, again, issuing warnings,

PP> etc., with our release of the K-2 and the Ultimate Secret Reports.

PP> And, again, you had not seen or examined the supporting documents

PP> at the time you issued those warnings to ParaNet and the public.



We have already stated our reasons for suspecting the 'K-2' and "Ultimate
Secret" reports. As with the 'Dulce' report, our suspicions went to the
core of the entire concept and execution of both reports; consequently, it
seemed unlikely that the "supporting documents" would make much difference.
Our judgement in this matter was borne out when we received the "supporting
documents" from another source. We were not impressed.



PP> Would we be out of line in concluding that your mind was already

PP> made-up?



Yes, that would be out of line, since our minds were not and in fact are
not yet entirely made up. Our warnings were tentative, and in our view
totally justified. So far we have not been provided with any evidence to
the contrary. If such evidence is provided, we will not only change our
minds but say so publicly.



PP> Fortunately, for the UFO Movement, other investigators and

PP> researchers don't share your opinion.



That's not the feedback we've been getting.



PP> You state in your initial message that "much of the information

PP> in the Dulce Report about Dulce and the Archuleta Mesa contradicts

PP> information already provided to ParaNet by other capable

PP> investigators." What information? Who provided it? How did

PP> you determine its validity?



Our information consists of the testimony of ParaNet investigators and
others who have been in Dulce and on the Mesa. Their experiences were very
different from what you describe, and it is difficult to reconcile your
claims with the findings of our own people.



PP> We formally request access to that information. We'd like to

PP> examine it ourselves. Can we obtain copies of 'that' information?



Our investigation continues, and the information will be made public when
it is complete. At that time we will be glad to provide you with a
complimentary copy of our report.



PP> Now, let us get to the main thrust of your message - your

PP> investigation to reveal the personnel of the Phoenix Project.

PP>

PP> [several paragraphs of meaningless abuse deleted]

PP>

PP> What, if anything, is the Phoenix Project guilty of? Is it

PP> the fact that we dared to question and investigate two of the

PP> sacred cows of UFO-dom namely the ones you mentioned, i.e.,

PP> "underground alien bases, and the cluster of government projects

PP> referred to collectively as Operation Majestic Twelve?"

No. ParaNet has long questioned both of those sacred cows. To this point we
have seen no acceptable PROOF for the existence of any underground alien
base near Dulce, nor have we seen adequate proof for the existence of
"Operation Majestic Twelve". We have publicly stated as much on many
occasions. (Note: I personally believe that there is much 'evidence' for
underground activity near Dulce. As for 'proof' -- along the line of a
Network video crew broadcasting a Live Special Report from inside the Dulce
underground labs or something of the sort -- admittedly that kind of
'proof' is yet to be forthcoming. - Branton)



PP> According to our sources within the intelligence community, the

PP> Dulce Scam, perpetrated by the disinformation specialists of MAJI,

PP> better known to you as Majestic Twelve with help from the CIA and

PP> NSA, is considered one of their most brilliant success stories.



But, of course, these 'sources' cannot be named, and all we have to go on
is your word that they even exist. And, unfortunately, you are making a
concerted effort to keep anyone from knowing who *you* are, either.
Anonymous stories relayed by anonymous story tellers. Sorry, but that's not
'evidence'.



PP> We sent in experienced investigators, not amateurs, to check out

PP> the alleged Dulce Base. Those people knew what to look for, how

PP> to look for it, how to get answers, and are not easily mislead.



We have no evidence for this except your say-so.



PP> If you do not agree with our findings, get off your posterior, go

PP> to Dulce, and check it out for yourself.



We have.



PP> In fact, we invite anybody to do the same thing. We're sure you'll

PP> find exactly what we did ...



We didn't.



PP> You imply that you're good at asking questions -- how are you

PP> at answering them? We have a few questions ... Would you mind

PP> sharing with all of us, everyone on the BBS's and the public, what

PP> hard evidence you have that, without question, supports the presence

PP> and validity of the Dulce Base.



Would you mind sharing what hard evidence you have that we ever said
anything of the kind? We have never said anything in support of the
presence of a secret alien base at Dulce. In point of fact, we consider it
extremely unlikely that any such base exists -- at Dulce or anywhere else.
That's one of the reasons we have so much trouble with your 'K-2' report,
which purports to document the existence of just such a base in California.



PP> Unless you have irrefutable evidence to present, made available

PP> for public scrutiny and evaluation, which invalidates the findings

PP> of the Phoenix Project regarding Dulce, K-2, or the Ultimate Secret,

PP> or our future reports, back off. Either put-up or shut-up. In other

PP> words, get off our back.



All right, challenge accepted. Let's start with this statement from your
"Ultimate Secret" report:



PP> According to eye-witness testimony, the CIA agent

PP> in charge of this covert operation, wearing the

PP> uniform of an AF Colonel, was William C. Cooper. ...

PP> This witness testifies that this is the same William C.

PP> Cooper, who has been prominent since 1988 in the

PP> civilian UFO movement.



Is this "William C. Cooper" supposed to be the famous Bill Cooper we have
all come to know so well? Apparently so. Unfortunately, in his own
published documents Bill Cooper gives his full name as "Milton William
Cooper", not "William C. Cooper". Either Cooper doesn't know his own name,
or the Phoenix Project's "eye witness" doesn't know what he's talking
about.



And while we're on the subject of Bill Cooper, it is instructive to compare
some of the text of the Phoenix Project's "Ultimate Secret" document with
some of Bill Cooper's material on the same subject. Cooper writes in his
"Operation Majority -- Final Release":



BC> [Project Grudge] was financed by CIA confidential funds

BC> [nonappropriated] and money from the illicit drug trade ...

BC> The purpose of Project Grudge was to collect all scientific,

BC> technological, medical and intelligence information from

BC> UFO/IAC sightings and contacts with alien life forms. This

BC> orderly file of collected information has been used to advance

BC> the United States Space Program.



Now look at the corresponding paragraph of the Phoenix Project's "Ultimate
Secret" report:



PP> Project Aquarius was funded by CIA confidential funds

PP> [non-appropriated] ... The purpose of Project Aquarius

PP> was to collect all scientific, technological, medical

PP> and intelligence information from UFO/IAC sightings and

PP> contacts with alien lifeforms. This orderly file of collected

PP> information has been used to advance the United States'

PP> Space Program and provided the data needed to develop

PP> present stealth technology.



You don't have to be an intelligence agent to see that these two passages
are virtually identical in both content and phrasing. Since Cooper's
statement is dated 10 January 1989, more than half a year before the
"Ultimate Secret" report's 'origination' date of 4 August 1989, we seem to
be left with three possibilities: (1) Cooper was somehow privy to the
Phoenix Project's investigative results even before they were first put to
paper; or, (2) the Phoenix Project plagiarized Cooper's writings; or (3)
the Phoenix Project's own investigations drew on the same [original]
sources as Cooper apparently did in compiling his own materials. Whichever
one you pick, it's not a pretty picture.



But it gets worse:



PP> The basic information revealing the existence of

PP> Operation Majestic-12, the crashed UFOs, alien beings,

PP> and their secret bases within the United States, was

PP> obtained through the Freedom of Information Act from the

PP> files of the CIA, NSA, FBI, State Department, the U.S.

PP> Air Force.

This is utter nonsense, as any perusal of published FOIA documents on UFOs
would quickly reveal. FOIA requests have forced the government to disgorge
many hundreds of pages of UFO documents over the years, but they provide
little if any support for the existence of Operation Majestic Twelve,
crashed saucers, alien beings, or secret bases. If the Phoenix Project is
relying on already published documents as their source for this claim
[e.g., "The UFO Cover-UP" by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry Green-wood, or
"Above Top Secret" by Timothy Good], then clearly they have not examined
them very carefully. On the other hand, if the project really does have
such explosive FOIA documents in its possession, let's see them; their
publication would do more to establish the project's credibility than
anything else it could possibly do short of producing a live alien.



PP> PROJECT GRUDGE: This project was originally

PP> established in 1953, by order of President Eisenhower

PP> and is under the control of the CIA, NSA, and MAJI.

PP> Project Grudge went underground and another project,

PP> Project Sign, was established as a cover operation.

PP> In 1960, the Project's name was changed from Project

PP> SIGN to Project Bluebook.



This is demonstrably and totally wrong. Project Sign was established first,
in 1947, and it was under the control of the Air Force, not the CIA. The
name was changed to Project Grudge in 1949, and to Blue Book in 1952 -- not
1960. [For details, see "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" by
Edward J. Ruppelt, who headed the project from 1951 to 1953.] The exact
dates slide around a little bit depending on whether you're talking about
when the decision was made, when the order was signed, or when the order
became effective; but the differences are on the order of months, not
decades! How could the Phoenix Project's experienced intelligence agents
make so many ludicrous errors in a single paragraph?

In fact, this whole business was such an embarrassing mess that the Phoenix
Project issued a 'correction' document to try to straighten it out. But,
ironically, the correction is also wrong -- just less obviously so.



We could go on, but I think you get the point. The "Ultimate Secret" report
is, at best, a rehash of other people's garbage. At worst, it is a
deliberate effort to confuse and disinform.



PP> We actively encourage other serious investigators to use the

PP> information we have provided as a basis for conducting their

PP> own inquiry and to carry-on our effort. Can you, Mr. Corbin,

PP> or ParaNet, or Mufon, make the same claim. Or, is it true that

PP> the results of critical investigations are held sacred by the

PP> elite leadership of these organizations, and are not shared with

PP> the member's of their organizations or the public?



We can't speak for other organizations, but in the case of ParaNet we have
always made our results public as soon as our investigations are complete.



PP> In your message, you insinuate that because of our past military

PP> and intelligence backgrounds, our area of expertise so-to-speak,

PP> that the motives of the Phoenix Project are suspect. You further

PP> insinuate that we are possibly government operatives attempting

PP> to send serious researchers off on a variety of wild goose chases.



Given the prior history of government disinformation in ufology, most of it
purveyed by active or former intelligence agents and their victims, anyone
who (1) purports to have a military intelligence background, (2) refuses to
divulge their identity, and (3) propagates known disinformation as reliable
intelligence [whether deliberately or not] should expect his motives to be
considered suspect until proven otherwise. It is extremely naive of you to
think it would happen any other way.



PP> If anyone needed assurance that the truth regarding UFO's

PP> will remain a deep, dark, secret -- they can rest secure in

PP> the knowledge that you, are on the job. There are any number

PP> of government agencies who would welcome you with open arms.

PP> Expect some offers.



Sorry, none so far. We'll let you know if we get any.



PP> We are sure that the honest and sincere members of ParaNet and

PP> other UFO investigative organizations [and there are many] must

PP> be seriously considering whether your qualifications, fitness and

PP> investigative ability warrant your continuance in a position of

PP> leadership within what used to be a respected research organization.



(Note: In my own experience with misiformation, disinformation and dubunker
'agents', very little effort is made to address the information at hand or
rationally explain-away information, claims or data that is being released
by an individual. Most of the efforts on the part of such agents are
directed against the individuals themselves, as in character assassinations
and attacks. In many cases they KNOW that they cannot refute the
information, so they attempt to discredit the information through character
assassination. Do police officers immediately "discredit" what a drug
dealer tells them when he is exposing his superiors so that he himself can
aquire a lesser sentence, or what a convicted child molester might tell
them about a ritual child abuse ring that he has been involved with? No,
especially if there is sufficient evidence to back up their claims. Someone
who has been involved personally with some illicit activity can be more of
a reliable source than someone who just hears about it second-hand. So the
character assassination strategy by certain agents does not hold water
especially in a case such as this, wherein ParaNet officials have had their
character and integrity UNJUSTLY attacked in order to DIVERT ATTENTION from
the subject at hand, OR TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE LACK OF INTEGRITY OR
OUTRIGHT DECIETFULNESS OF THESE 'AGENTS' THEMSELVES. I personally do not
claim to be the infallible specimen of a perfect human being. I have a jail
record, and suffer from emotional and psychological disabilities resulting
from years of suppressed interactions with what I believe to be malevolent
alien agendas and certain human agencies which are or were involved with
them. Although the psychological-emotional turmoil or instability may not
be entirely my fault, the jail term was a result of my own
irresponsibility. What I am trying to say is that I do not CLAIM to have it
all together any more than the average human being does, so why engage in
'character assassination' against someone who lives in a world whose
overall inhabitants are generally lacking in perfect character? Show me
someone with full awareness of "good and evil" who has never broken a law
or one of the ten commandments. Aside from the Messiah Himself, there is no
human being on earth that can make such a claim. And most often then not,
when someone targets an individual for character assassination, as they
say, "It takes one to know one." So in the search for the truth about what
is really happening in this world, I would suggest that you do not get
caught-up in emotional exchanges and character attacks which only serve to
cloud the real issue -- which is WHETHER THE INFORMATION ITSELF IS OR IS
NOT CORRECT! This is not to say that 'character' has no bearing whatsoever
on information. For instance someone who has been known in the past to be a
con artist might not be taken as seriously as an ORIGINAL SOURCE of
information as, you might say, someone who has won a Pulitzer prize for
investigative journalism. However we do need to keep a 'balance'. -

Exactly the opposite, actually. Most of our people are grateful for the
warning, and are coming to the same conclusions as we did.



PP> Instead of making an honest attempt to validate or disprove our

PP> findings regarding the subjects mentioned -- missing the point

PP> completely, you chose to become obsessed with determining

PP> the identity of Phoenix Project personnel. For what reason? Do

PP> you intend to judge the validity of the information based on the

PP> credentials of those providing it? Some people would interpret

PP> that as putting the cart before the horse.



And some people would interpret it as a determination not to fall prey to
the same fate as far too many others in this field, who trusted strangers
too easily and ended up wasting years chasing wild geese -- or worse...



PP> You suggest a possible link between our organization and America

PP> West. Sorry about that, but you're dead wrong. It has come

PP> to us from several sources that we're not on their list of favorite

PP> people. We will take this opportunity to categorically deny that

PP> we have any affiliation with America West, their publication the

PP> "Phoenix Liberator," or any other publication they provide. Do

PP> not expect us to respond to the other coincidences, suppositions,

PP> insinuations or innuendoes contained in your message.



Why? Perhaps because there are other 'insinuations' that cannot be
truthfully denied? As a matter of fact, we now have solid confirmation of
another one of our 'insinuations' -- i.e., the fact that the Richard Miller
who owns Advent Publishing is indeed the same Richard Miller who used to
channel 'Hatonn'. That confirmation came from none other than Mr. Miller
himself. So I guess we're not doing too badly.



In consideration of your explicit denials of any ties to America West, and
in view of the additional information provided privately by Mr. Miller, we
withdraw our previous suggestion of possible connections between the
Phoenix Project and the America West/Phoenix Liberator operation. As we
stated before, those suggestions were tentative pending further
investigation, and further investigation has not uncovered any additional
evidence to support them. Unfortunately, this is the kind of burden that
the Phoenix Project inevitably took on when it chose to publicly portray
itself as a clandestine organization.



PP> Since you brought up America West and The "Phoenix Liberator,"

PP> why not turn your investigative abilities loose on their

PP> organization. Just suppose that Milton Cooper is, quietly,

PP> linked to their organization. That should intrigue you...

PP> Equally intriguing, is where their funding comes from - not the

PP> obvious subscription income - the covert funding. Or, how about

PP> the busy and numerous, off premise, writers that prepare the volumes

PP> of 'Hatonn' material, and their use of high-speed modems to provide

PP> the copy for each weekly issue of the "Phoenix Liberator" and the

PP> dozens of books they produce. In our supposition, we're talking

PP> about a big-time operation. You might also check out their printing

PP> facilities, distribution centers, and world-wide circulation. Equally

PP> fascinating is their sudden rise, in a few short years, to the top of

PP> the New Age Movement. You might even think to ask yourself, why the

PP> New Age Movement? What possible connection is there with covert

PP> government UFO activities, or a New World Order, with the New Age

PP> Movement? The answer to that might be revealed, if you dig deep

PP> enough, and discover high-speed modem links between their headquarters

PP> and certain organizations located at Langley and Ft. Meade. Yes, if

PP> you really dig, you might uncover all kinds of interesting things

PP> about America West.



Thanks for the tip.



(I may be wrong, but this sounds very similar to the ramblings of cultists
who have broken off from the 'mother' sect to establish their own branch
cults... essentially agreeing with the basic 'belief system' -- which in
this case might be the channeling of 'Ashtar' intelligence's -- while at
the same time claiming that 'they' and not their former 'apostate leaders'
are the sole spokesmen for the 'higher powers' on earth. As for the
religious 'denomination' in which I was raised, one which dominates a major
western state and stretches the Constitutional restrictions on separation
of church and state to their uttermost limits, I have come to find out that
over 500 'branch' religions ranging from a few followers to tens of
thousands of followers have separated from the 'main' denomination. This is
one of the main reasons why I became a non-denominationalist
Judeo-Christian. One of these 500-or-so branches incidentally was the
'Freeman Order' which was involved in a drawn-out FBI stand-off in 1996.
The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights allows for the right to worship as
one wishes SO LONG AS one does not infringe on the constitutional rights of
others and the laws of the land. Of course 'inquisitional' or 'terrorist'
religious practices, or the 'religious' practice of ritual child abuse, or
religious institutions that attempt to force their will upon an elected
government, or one whose members in government use taxpayer funds or
personal influence to show political favoritism towards their 'churches',
have no place in a Constitutional Democratic-Republic. Nor does a our
Constitutional system have to put up with cults like the 'Freemen' who have
blatantly resisted the PUBLICLY-instituted legal restrictions against money
fraud or child sexual abuse, even if the 'Freeman' or similar cults
hypocritically use 'Ruby Ridge', 'Waco' or other legitimate yet incendiary
catch-phrases to justify their own illegal activities. - Branton)



PP> As to your effort in trying to identify staff personnel of the

PP> Phoenix Project -- good luck. However, we do have to admit that

PP> you may get lucky and hit on a couple of them. However, since

PP> there are many, it is doubtful you will ever get beyond that point.



Our only interest in the personnel of the Phoenix Project is to determine
whether the Project has a hidden agenda, and whether it is covertly linked
to other organizations whose agendas are known. That interest was made
necessary by the Project's clandestine nature and consequent lack of public
accountability. You brought it on yourselves, and your continuing hostility
and evasiveness suggest that we were not entirely mistaken in our
suspicions.



Our investigation continues. We'll let you know what we find out.
