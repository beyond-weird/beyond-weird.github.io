                                       expansion overseas through an
                                       aggressive exploration program
                                       underway in several countries. ARCO
                                       is a major gas producer in China,
                                       the United Kingdom North Sea and a
                                       major oil and gas producer in
                                       Indonesia. In 1992, the company
                                       signed an agreement with the
                                       People's Republic of China to
                                       develop a South China Sea natural
                                       gas field with an estimated 3
                                       trillion gross cubic feet of gas
                                       reserves discovered by ARCO nine
                                       years earlier. ARCO is operator and
                                       34.3 percent partner in the China
                                       project. A 480-mile pipeline to
                                       Hong Kong was completed in late
                                       1995, and start-up of the field
                                       took place in January 1996.

                                       In another milestone development
                                       (February 1996), ARCO signed a
                                       production sharing contract with
                                       Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil
                                       company, to undertake a major
                                       Enhanced Oil Recovery project at
                                       Rhourde El Baguel, Algeria's second
                                       largest oil field. In addition to a
                                       $225 million bonus payment to
                                       Sonatrach, ARCO will invest over
                                       $1.3 billion in the project. EOR
                                       efforts should yield over 500
                                       million total barrels of crude oil
                                       equivalent. ARCO will receive up to
                                       49% of the project's annual
                                       production.

                                       ARCO has clearly identified itself
                                       as a hydrocarbon-based company,
