DULCE NEW MEXICO AND A COSMIC CONSPIRACY?





John Lear, a captain of a major U.S. Airline has flown over 160 different
types of aircraft in over 50 different countries. He holds 17 world speed
records in the Lear Jet and is the only pilot ever to hold every airman
certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. Mr. Lear has
flown missions worldwide for the CIA and other government agencies. He has
flown clandestine missions in war-zones and hot-spots around the world,
often engineering hairs'-breath escapes under dangerous conditions. A
former Nevada State Senatorial candidate, he is the son of William P. Lear,
designer of the Lear Jet executive airplane, the 8-track stereo, and
founder of the LEAR Siegler Corporation. John Lear became interested in the
subject of UFO's 13 months prior to the date given below, after talking
with a friend in the United States Air Force by the name of Greg Wilson who
had witnessed a UFO landing at Bentwaters AFB, near London, England, during
which three small 'gray' aliens walked up to the Wing Commander. Since then
Lear has tapped his contacts in intelligence, investigating the allegations
that the executive and military-industrial branches of the United States
'government' knows about, and colludes with, alien forces. Lear no longer
suggests the following scenario is a 'possibility', he emphatically states
that the aliens are here, and that many of them bode us ill.



"It started after World War II," he begins.

"We [the Allied forces] recovered some alien technology from Germany -- not
all that they had; some of it disappeared. It appears that some time in the
late '30s, Germany recovered a saucer. What happened to it we don't know.
But what we did get was some kind of ray gun..."



The following is a "Public Statement" released by John Lear on December 29,
1987 and revised on March 25, 1988. It was originally sent to some of
Lear's personal friends and research associates who in turn put pressure on
the Ace Pilot to release this information publicly. The first version of
the statement was apparently meant for the 'inside' crowd of researchers
with whom Lear associated, whereas the following revision contains the same
information as the first edition, yet is directed towards the public in
general:



NOTE TO THE PRESS:



"The government of the United States continues to rely on your personal and
professional gullibility to suppress the information contained herein. Your
cooperation over the past 40 years has exceeded OUR wildest expectations
and we salute you.

"'The sun does not revolve around the Earth'.

"'The United States Government has been in business with little gray
extraterrestrials for about 20 years'.

"The first truth stated here got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake in AD
1600 for daring to propose that it was real. THE SECOND TRUTH HAS GOTTEN
FAR MORE PEOPLE KILLED TRYING TO STATE IT PUBLICLY THAN WILL EVER BE KNOWN.
(Note: emphasis here and throughout this section is ours. - Branton)

"But the truth must be told. The fact that the Earth revolves around the
sun was successfully suppressed by the [Roman] church for over 200 years.
It eventually caused a major upheaval in the church, government, and
thought. A realignment of social and traditional values. That was in the
1600's.

"Now, about 400 years after the first truth was pronounced we must again
face the shocking facts. The 'horrible truth' the government has been
hiding from us over 40 years. Unfortunately, the 'horrible truth' is far
more horrible than the government ever imagined.

"In its effort to 'protect democracy', our government sold us to the
aliens. And here is how it happened. But before I begin, I'd like to offer
a word in defense of those who bargained us away. They had the best of
intentions.

"Germany may have recovered a flying saucer as early as 1939. General James
H. Doolittle went to Norway in 1952 to inspect a flying saucer that had
crashed there in Spitzbergen.

"The 'horrible truth' was known by only a very few persons: They were
indeed ugly little creatures, shaped like praying mantises... Of the
original group that were the first to learn the 'horrible truth', SEVERAL
COMMITTED SUICIDE, the most prominent of which was Defense Secretary [and
Secretary of the NAVY] James V. Forrestal who jumped to his death from a
16th story hospital window.

(Note: William Cooper, a former member of a Navy Intelligence briefing
team, insists that Forrestal was in fact murdered by CIA agents who made
his death look like a suicide. Based on sensitive documents Cooper claims
to have read, two CIA agents entered the hospital room, tied a bedsheet
around Forrestal's neck and to a light fixture, and threw him out the
window to hang. The bedsheet[s] broke and he fell to his death, screaming
on his way down according to some witnesses "We're being invaded!" -
Branton).

"Secretary Forrestal's medical records are sealed to this day.

"President Truman put a lid on the secret and turned the screws so tight
that the general public still thinks that flying saucers are a joke. Have I
ever got a surprise for them.

"In 1947, President Truman established a group of 12 of the top military
scientific personnel of their time. They were known as MJ-12. Although the
group exists today, none of the ORIGINAL members are still alive. The last
one to die was Gordon Gray, former Secretary of the Army, in 1984.

"As each member passed away, the group itself appointed a new member to
fill the position. There is some speculation that the group known as MJ-12
expanded to at least seven more members.

"There were several more saucer crashes in the late 1940's, one in Roswell,
New Mexico; one in Aztec, New Mexico; and one near Laredo, Texas, about 30
miles inside the Mexican border.

"Consider, if you will, the position of the United States Government at
that time. They proudly thought of themselves as the most powerful nation
on Earth, having recently produced the atomic bomb, an achievement so
stupendous, it would take Russia 4 years to catch up, and only with the
help of traitors to Democracy. They had built a jet aircraft that had
exceeded the speed of sound in flight. They had built jet bombers with
inter-continental range that could carry weapons of enormous destruction.
The post war era, and the future seemed bright. Now imagine what it was
like for those same leaders, all of whom had witnessed the panic of Orson
Wells' radio broadcast, "The War of the Worlds", in 1938. Thousands of
Americans panicked at a realistically presented invasion of Earth by beings
from another planet. Imagine their horror as they actually viewed THE DEAD
BODIES OF THESE FRIGHTENING LITTLE CREATURES WITH ENORMOUS EYES, REPTILIAN
SKIN AND CLAW LIKE FINGERS. Imagine their shock as they attempted to
determine how these strange 'saucers' were powered and could discover no
part even remotely similar to components they were familiar with: no
cylinders or pistons, no vacuum tubes or turbines or hydraulic actuators.
It is only when you fully understand the overwhelming helplessness the
government was faced with in the late 40's that you can comprehend their
perceived need for a total, thorough and sweeping cover up, to include the
use of 'deadly force'.

"The cover-up was so successful that as late as 1985 a senior scientist
with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, Dr. Al Hibbs,
would look at a video tape of an enormous flying saucer and state the
record, 'I'm not going to assign anything to that [UFO] phenomena without a
lot more data.' Dr. Hibbs was looking at the naked emperor and saying, 'He
certainly looks naked, but that doesn't prove he's naked.'

"In July 1952, a panicked government watched helplessly as a squadron of
'flying saucers' flew over Washington, D.C., and buzzed the White House,
the Capitol Building, and the Pentagon. It took all the imagination and
intimidation the government could muster to force that incident out of the
memory of the public.

"Thousands of sightings occurred during the Korean war and several more
saucers were retrieved by the Air Force. Some were stored at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some were stored at Air Force bases near
the locations of the crash site.

"One saucer was so enormous and the logistic problems in transportation so
enormous that it was buried at the crash site and remains there today. The
stories are legendary on transporting crashed saucers over long distances,
moving only at night, purchasing complete farms, slashing through forests,
blocking major highways, sometimes driving 2 or 3 lo-boys in tandem with an
extraterrestrial load a hundred feet in diameter. (It is alleged that ALPHA
or BLUE Teams out of Wright-Patterson AFB were the ones who were most often
mobilized to carry out "crash-retrieval" operations. - Branton)

"On April 30, 1964, the first communication [occurred] between these aliens
and the 'U.S. Government'. (Others claim that there was an even earlier
contact-communication in 1954 during the Eisenhower administration. -
Branton)

"During the period of 1969-1971, MJ-12 representing the U.S. Government
made a deal with these creatures, called EBE's [Extraterrestrial Biological
Entities, named by Detley Bronk, original MJ-12 member and 6th President of
John Hopkins University]. The 'deal' was that in exchange for 'technology'
that they would provide to us, we agreed to 'ignore' the abductions that
were going on and suppress information on the cattle mutilations. The EBE's
assured MJ-12 that the abductions [usually lasting about 2 hours] were
merely the ongoing monitoring of developing civilizations.

"In fact, the purposes for the abductions turned out to be:

"(1) The insertion of a 3mm spherical device through the nasal cavity of
the abductee into the brain [optic and/or nerve center], the device is used
for the biological monitoring, tracking, and control of the abductee.

"(2) Implementation of Posthypnotic Suggestion to carry out a specific
activity during a specific time period, the actuation of which will occur
within the next 2 to 5 years.

"(3) Termination of some people so that they could function as living
sources for biological material and substances.

"(4) TERMINATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO REPRESENT A THREAT TO THE CONTINUATION
OF THEIR ACTIVITY.

"(5) Effect genetic engineering experiments.

"(6) Impregnation of human females and early termination of pregnancies to
secure the crossbreed infant.

(Note: Or perhaps a better term for it would be a "genetically altered"
infant, since there has been no evidence forthcoming that an actual
'hybrid' between humans and the 'EBE' or 'Grey' species has been
successful. In other words, the offspring would tend to fall to one side or
the other, a 'reptilioid' or 'grey' entity possessing no
'soul-energy-matrix', or a humanoid being possessing such a matrix or soul
although somewhat altered genetically in it's outward physical appearance
or characteristics. - Branton).

"The U.S. Government was NOT initially aware of the far reaching
consequences of their 'deal'. They were LED to believe that the abductions
were essentially benign AND SINCE THEY FIGURED THAT THE ABDUCTIONS WOULD
PROBABLY GO ON ANYWAY WHETHER THEY AGREED OR NOT, they merely insisted on a
current list of abductees be submitted, on a periodic basis, to MJ-12 and
the National Security Council. Does this sound incredible? An actual list
of abductees sent to the National Security Council? Read on, because I have
news for you...

"The EBE's have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system is
atrophied and not functional... In order to sustain themselves they use
enzyme or hormonal secretions obtained from the tissues that they extract
from humans and animals.

"The secretions obtained are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide [to kill
germs, viruses, etc.] and applied on the skin by spreading or dipping parts
of their bodies in the solution. The body absorbs the solution, then
excretes the waste back through the skin. (Urine is also excreted through
the skin in this manner, which may explain the ammonia-like STENCH that
many abductees or witnesses have reported during encounters with the
grey-type 'aliens'. - Branton).

"The cattle mutilations that were prevalent throughout the period from 1973
to 1983 and publicly noted through newspaper and magazine stories and
included a documentary produced by Linda Howe for a Denver CBS affiliate
KMGH-TV, were for the collection of these tissues by the aliens. The
mutilations included genitals taken, rectums cored out to the colon, eyes,
tongue, and throat all surgically removed with extreme precision. In some
cases the incisions were made by cutting between the cells, a process we
are not yet capable of performing in the field. In many of the mutilations
there was no blood found at all in the carcass, yet there was no vascular
collapse of the internal organs. THIS HAS ALSO BEEN NOTED IN THE HUMAN
MUTILATIONS, one of the first of which was Sgt. Jonathan P. Lovette at the
White Sands Missile Test Range in 1956, who was found three days after an
Air Force Major had witnessed his abduction by a 'disk shaped' object at
0300 while on search for missile debris downrange. His genitals had been
removed, rectum cored out in a surgically precise 'plug' up to the colon,
eyes removed and all blood removed with, again, no vascular collapse. From
some of the evidence it is apparent that this surgery is accomplished, in
most cases, WHILE THE VICTIM, ANIMAL OR HUMAN, IS STILL ALIVE.

(Note: According to former Green Beret commander Bill English, THIS
incident was also mentioned in the Above-Top-Secret "GRUDGE / BLUE BOOK
REPORT NO. 13" which was never released with the rest of the innocuous and
voluminous "Project Blue Book" reports. The "Blue Teams" who were sent on
crash-retrieval operations were reportedly working on behalf of the covert
branch of the Blue Book operations, and Ufological legend has it that a
secret warehouse with multiple underground levels exists at Wright
Patterson AFB in Ohio, one which is literally packed with alien craft,
hardware, and even alien bodies 'on ice'. Wright Patterson was -- and is?
-- the headquarters of Project Blue Book. - Branton)

"THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY ARE TAKEN TO VARIOUS UNDERGROUND
LABORATORIES, ONE OF WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE NEAR THE SMALL NEW MEXICO TOWN OF
DULCE. THIS JOINTLY OCCUPIED [CIA-ALIEN] FACILITY HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS
ENORMOUS, WITH HUGE TILED WALLS THAT 'GO ON FOREVER'. WITNESSES HAVE
REPORTED HUGE VATS FILLED WITH AMBER LIQUID WITH PARTS OF HUMAN BODIES
BEING STIRRED INSIDE.

"After the initial agreement, Groom Lake, one of the nations most secret
test centers, was closed for a period of about a year, sometime between
about 1972 and 1974, AND A HUGE UNDERGROUND FACILITY WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR
AND WITH THE HELP OF THE EBE'S. THE 'BARGAINED FOR' TECHNOLOGY WAS SET IN
PLACE BUT COULD ONLY BE OPERATED BY THE EBE'S THEMSELVES. NEEDLESS TO SAY,
THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY COULD NOT BE USED AGAINST THE EBE'S THEMSELVES,
EVEN IF NEEDED.

"During the period between 1979 and 1983 it became increasingly obvious to
MJ-12 that things were not going as planned. IT BECAME KNOWN THAT MANY MORE
PEOPLE [IN THE THOUSANDS] WERE BEING ABDUCTED THAN WERE LISTED ON THE
OFFICIAL ABDUCTION LISTS. IN ADDITION IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SOME, NOT ALL,
BUT SOME OF THE NATION'S MISSING CHILDREN HAD BEEN USED FOR SECRETIONS AND
OTHER PARTS REQUIRED BY THE ALIENS.

"IN 1979 THERE WAS AN ALTERCATION OF SORTS AT THE DULCE LABORATORY. A
SPECIAL ARMED FORCES UNIT WAS CALLED IN TO TRY AND FREE A NUMBER OF OUR
PEOPLE TRAPPED IN THE FACILITY, WHO HAD BECOME AWARE OF WHAT WAS REALLY
GOING ON. ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE 66 OF THE SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND OUR
PEOPLE WERE NOT FREED.

"By 1984, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror at the mistake they had made
in dealing with the EBE's. They had subtly promoted 'Close Encounters of
the Third Kind' and 'E.T.' to get the public used to 'odd looking' aliens
that were compassionate, benevolent and very much our 'space brothers'.
MJ-12 'sold' the EBE's to the public, and were now faced with the fact THAT
QUITE THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE. In addition, a plan was formulated in 1968 to
make the public aware of the existence of aliens on earth over the next 20
years to be culminated with several documentaries to be released during
1985-1987 period of time. These documentaries would explain the history and
intentions of the EBE's. The discovery of the 'GRAND DECEPTION' put the
entire plans, hopes and dreams of MJ-12 into utter confusion and panic.

"Meeting at the 'Country Club', a remote lodge with private golf course,
comfortable sleeping and working quarters, and its own private airstrip
built by and exclusively for the members of MJ-12, it was a factional fight
of what to do now. PART OF MJ-12 WANTED TO CONFESS THE WHOLE SCHEME AND
SHAMBLES IT HAD BECOME TO THE PUBLIC, BEG THEIR FORGIVENESS AND ASK FOR
THEIR SUPPORT. The other part [the majority] of MJ-12 argued that there was
no way they could do that, that the situation was untenable and there was
no use in exciting the public with the 'horrible truth' and that the best
plan was to continue the development of a weapon that could be used against
the EBE's under the guise of 'SDI', the Strategic Defense Initiative, which
had nothing whatsoever to do with a defense for inbound Russian nuclear
missiles. As these words are being written, Dr. Edward Teller, 'father' of
the H-Bomb is personally in the test tunnels of the Nevada Test Site,
driving his workers and associates in the words of one, 'like a man
possessed'. And well he should, for Dr. Teller is a member of MJ-12 along
with Dr. Kissinger, Admiral Bobby Inman, and possibly Admiral Poindexter,
to name a few of the current members of MJ-12.

"Before the 'Grand Deception' was discovered and according to a meticulous
plan for metered release of information to the public, several
documentaries and video tapes were made. William Moore, a Burbank,
California, based UFO researcher who wrote 'The Roswell Incident' -- a book
published in 1980 that detailed the crash, recovery and subsequent cover-up
of a UFO with 4 alien bodies -- has a video tape of 2 newsmen interviewing
a military officer assoc
