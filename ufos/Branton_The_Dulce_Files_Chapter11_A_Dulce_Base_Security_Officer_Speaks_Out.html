A DULCE BASE SECURITY OFFICER SPEAKS OUT





The following is a list of questions that were directed to former Dulce
Base Security officer Thomas Edwin Castello approximately a year before his
death [or disappearance]. They are followed by his responses:



QUESTION - When exactly was the [upper human-occupied level of the]
Archuleta installation constructed?

ANSWER - I heard Dulce was started in 1937-38 by the Army engineers,
enlarged over the years, most recent work was completed 1965-66 to connect
tunnels to the Page [Arizona] Base, site of one of the older underground
facilities. The four corners base is called PERICA. Most of the Native
Americans [the Indians] living in that area are aware of that base, and
could tell us about the underground life forms that frequently are spotted
near those communities, Bigfoot, etc. (Note: The references to the Dulce
base here deal mainly with the upper levels, not the extreme lower levels
which include vast natural caverns and, some believe, very ancient tunnel
systems as well. This would include the tunnels illuminated by phosphorus
pentoxide which the alien grays avoid, and the origin of which is unknown.
In fact sources have informed us that some of the underground NORAD
facilities of Colorado were constructed within already-existing cavern
systems, suggesting that Ray Palmer and Richard Shaver were correct when as
early as the mid-1940's they wrote about the government's search for
ancient underground cave and tunnel systems to be converted for their own
use. - Branton)



Q -- By what means was the [upper] installations constructed? Are you
familiar with the alleged developments made by the Rand Corporation of a
highly-efficient bore or mole machine capable of melting rock using nuclear
powered wolfram-graphite tipped 'drill-cones'?

A -- According to several senior maintenance workers, part of it was
blasted by nuclear devices in the sixties. There are sections, like the
shuttle tunnels, that were formed by an advanced tunneling machine that
leaves the tunnel walls smooth. The finished walls in those tubes resemble
polished black glass.



Q -- By WHOM was the Dulce installation originally constructed?

A -- Nature started the caverns. The Draco [reptilian humanoids] used the
caverns and tunnels for centuries. Later, through RAND Corporation plans,
it was enlarged repeatedly. The original caverns included ice caves and
sulfur springs that the 'aliens' found perfect for their needs. The Dulce
caverns rival Carlsbad caverns in size. (Note: Carlsbad caverns and
especially the adjacent Lecheguilla caves are 'officially' among the
largest and deepest in the world, with several 'leads' that remain to be
explored by professional speleonauts - Branton)



Q -- What exactly are the cattle [and human] organs such as blood, anal
tissue, eyes, reproductive organs, tongues, etc. used for -- i.e. the
organs obtained via cattle and human mutilations?

A -- Read the so-called Dulce papers [for more information].



Q -- Are the various electromagnetically-controlled air or space craft --
[that have been seen] leaving from and arriving at Mt. Archuleta -- manned
by humans, the 'alien entities', or both?

A -- Archuleta Mesa is a minor area... the craft leave [and are stored] in
five areas. One is SE of DULCE, one near Durango Co., one at Taos, N. M.,
and the main fleet is stored at LOS ALAMOS [under]. (Note: I believe Thomas
Castello is referring to the 'joint-operational' fleet. From combined
sources however it appears as if Dulce is absolutely SURROUNDED ON ALL
SIDES by 'alien' bases, and that Archuleta peak -- although apparently the
central NEXUS of the entire underground network -- is nevertheless just one
part of an overall complex that some claim is nearly the size of Manhattan!
One source has indicated that there are chambers a few hundred feet below
the very town of Dulce itself that are part of level one of the facility.
This close proximity may explain why it has usually been described as the
'Dulce Base'. Apparently even with his high-security clearance, Thomas
Castello was only familiar with one part of the overall mega-complex which
underlies the area. Whatever amount of activity is taking place there,
different sources seem to indicate that the town of Dulce nevertheless lies
over a major crossroads, convergence or 'intersection' area of alien
activity even though the 'core' of alien activity has been extended to Los
Alamos. Los Alamos and the mountainous regions east and southeast of it in
and around the Santa Fe National Forest seem to be the MAJOR 'nest' of
Reptiloid/Gray forces in North America, although there is also a large
number of 'dens' scattered throughout the underground networks between
Dulce and Area 51. Dulce seems to be a major 'through' point for exterran
and subterran reptilian activity, a central 'infiltration' zone for surface
operatives, as well as an operational base for
abduction-implantation-mutilation agendas and also a major convergence for
sub-shuttle terminals, UFO ports, and so on. - Branton)



Q -- Others have suggested that some of the entities below Dulce are not of
'extraterrestrial' ORIGIN, and that they are actually descended from
saurian or reptiloid beings such as the Velociraptors or Stenonychosaurus
Equallus -- a 'serpentine' race or races similar to that hinted at in the
third chapter of the book of Genesis?

A -- Yes, some 'reptoids' are native to this planet. The ruling caste of
'aliens' ARE reptilian. The beige or white beings are called The Draco.
Other reptilian beings are green, and some are brown. They were an ancient
race on Earth, living underground. It may have been one of the Draconian
beings that 'tempted' Eve in the Garden of Eden. Reptoids rightly consider
themselves "native Terrans." Perhaps they are the ones we call the Fallen
Angels. Maybe not, either way, we are [considered] the 'squatters' on
Earth.



Q -- Some have suggested that the so-called underground 'E.T.' bases and
tunnels may, for a large part, be literally thousands of years old...
constructions of an antediluvian race which attained to a considerable
level of scientific complexity, and who were destroyed by a
Divinely-initiated cataclysm which took place after they attempted to merge
their science with occult/supernatural forces. For instance some have
suggested that the Bermuda Triangle phenomena may be the result of an
out-of-control Atlantean experiment that led to a space-time disaster which
produced "electromagnetic fallout" in the Triangle area and elsewhere after
they had accidentally loosed powerful forces and energies into the world
that they knew very little about. Do your observations tend to confirm or
refute such a possibility?

A -- I'm not sure about the Divine part, but these 'aliens' consider
themselves 'NATIVE TERRANS.'



A -- Where do the little gray Aliens fit in?

Q -- They work for, and are controlled by the Draco. There are other gray
skinned beings that are not in league with the Draco.



Q -- Did you ever talk to any of the 'Aliens' at the Base?

A -- Since I was the Senior Security Technician at that base, I had to
communicate with them on a daily basis. If there were any problems that
involved security or video camera's, I was the one they called. It was the
reptilian "working caste" that usually did the physical labor in the lower
levels at Dulce. Decisions involving that caste were usually made by the
white Draco. When human workers caused problems for the working caste, the
reptoids went to the white Draconian 'boss', and the Draco called me. At
times, it felt like it was a never ending problem. Several human workers
resented the "no nonsense" or "get back to work" attitude the working caste
lives by. When needed, intervention became a vital tool. The biggest
problem were human workers who foolishly wandered around near the "OFF
LIMITS" areas of the "Alien Section." I guess it's human nature to be
curious and to wonder what is past the barriers. Too often someone found a
way to bypass the barriers and nosed around. The camera's near the entrance
usually stopped them before they got themselves in serious trouble. A few
times I had to formerly request the return of a human worker.



Q -- Are there other sites tied-in to the 'shuttle network' other than
those which you mentioned, and if so, where are the entrances?

A -- WHERE!?! EVERYWHERE! THEY CRISS CROSS THE WORLD AS AN ENDLESS
SUBTERRANEAN HIGHWAY. LIKE A FREEWAY, EXCEPT THIS ONE IS UNDERGROUND... The
subterranean highway in America is like a freeway except it's underground.
That highway depends on electric motors [for trucks, cars and buses] for
the paved roads, and it is for limited travel. There is another style of
transit for freight and for passengers that is for rapid travel. That world
wide network is called the "Sub-Global System." It has "check points" at
each country entry. There ARE shuttle tubes that 'shoot' the trains at
incredible speeds using a mag-lev and vacuum method. They travel at a speed
that excels the speed of sound. Part of your question involves the location
of entrances to that base. The easiest way to answer is to say every state
in the U.S.A. has them. Frequently, the entrances are camouflaged as sand
quarries, or mining operations. Other complex portals are found on military
bases. New Mexico and Arizona have the largest amounts of entrances
followed by California, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Kansas,
Arkansas and Missouri. Of all the state's Florida and North Dakota have the
least amount of entrances. Wyoming has a road that opens directly into the
subterranean freeway. That road is no longer in use, but could be
reactivated if they decide to do so, with minimal cost. It's located near
Brooks Lake.



Q -- Are there any 'bases' in the state of Utah? (Note: Thomas mentioned
several areas surrounding Utah -- Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and
Idaho, where there are 'connections', but little on Utah which according to
some sources lies directly over one of the largest NATURAL cavern systems
in North America, one that is said to reach deep beneath the Western
Rockies as well as beneath the Bonneville basin) Have you heard anything
about an alleged underground installation within the Wasatch Mountains...?

A -- Salt Lake, Lake Powell Area, Dark Canyon, Dougway Grounds, Modena,
Vernal. All have exits there. Others too.

(Note: There have been many rumors of ancient 'tunnel' systems being
intersected during the excavations of sub-basement levels below major
industrial and mall areas in downtown Salt Lake City. Various stories
surrounding these tunnels include: explorers who have entered the tunnels
and never returned; reports of 'lizard people' down in the labyrinths;
reports of grays working with humans on electronic equipment and massive
building projects going on in huge caverns beneath the mountains to the
east; reports of humans who are part of an Asian-based 'Agharti' kingdom
who maintain colonies within the tunnels and caverns below -- and who are
in conflict with the reptiloids, grays, and a group collaborating human
fascists from a network of massive underground facilities beneath the Neu
Shwabenland region of Antarctica; reports of men in suits having been seen
pacing back and forth through large underground chambers carrying uzi
machine guns; reports of seemingly bottomless shafts; large tunnels strung
with lights that are "big enough to drive a semi-truck through"; sections
of tunnel walls that looked solid yet which one could put their hands
through; rooms which emanate a strange greenish phosphorescent glow;
abductees who are taken below and encounter all types of aliens; discs that
have been seen emerging from the mountains to the east and attacking
incoming UFOs over the valley; Dungeons & Dragons fanatics who have been
down in the tunnels and tell wild stories of hundreds of miles of maze-like
passages; reports of connections to the tunnel systems via the
sewer-drainage network especially underneath the downtown "Crossroads"
area; reports of alien activity similar to that which has been described in
connection to Dulce New Mexico; and reports of a huge cavern network that
reaches beyond the border of the state in all directions -- a huge network
that connects the underground systems of Nevada with those of New Mexico.
There is a famous story which is not openly talked about -- there are two
versions... both may be true. In one version a Mormon Temple worker
penetrated an underground tunnel below the 'square' in downtown Salt Lake
City and traveled for some distance through a series of underground
catacombs until running into a 'lizard' like man. The creature attempted to
attack him but the man escaped and managed to find his way back to the
surface. He began telling other people what had happened and soon
afterwards the 'government' arrived in the area and went in and closed off
many of the tunnels leading to the sub-basements of the Temple. Presumably
there was some heated debates over how much of the underground system this
denomination was allowed to control. A similar dispute apparently occurred
to the southwest where the LDS church maintained a large storage facility
under Granite Mountain in Little Cottonwood canyon, within the upper levels
of a vast network of caverns. Fascist CIA elements and the Grays came in
and took control of the larger caverns deeper within the mountain and
ordered the 'vault' workers to stay out of the 'forbidden' areas -- and
stated that the "U.S. Government" was now using them for "National
Security" purposes and that it was their "patriotic duty" to maintain the
secret. The other version concerned a custodian who entered a tunnel near
the cinemas area below the Crossroads Mall across the street and to the
south from the temple square, while excavation was being carried out in a
that part of the Mall. The worker entered the tunnel and before long
encountered a 'serpent' type man, beat a hasty retreat, and told his fellow
workers what he had seen. The FBI and/or the local police soon arrived and
sealed the tunnel. Another story involved a young man who, along with a
friend, had used a chain tied to his pickup truck to rip-up a manhole cover
in the area near the 'Mall' and the 'Square'. They navigated through a maze
of sewer passages underneath and came to a shaft that descended in a series
of 5 small 'rooms' one below the other, and from the bottom room a tunnel
led south into a large chamber wherein they saw a seemingly bottomless
shaft, a large southwest tunnel strung with lights and 'large enough to
drive a semi through', and the footprints of some type of three-toed
bi-pedal creature. Other sources imply that early pioneers and settlers of
the area who explored these tunnels came in contact with and in some cases
even joined with some of the Telosian-Agharti-Melchizedek-Mayan underground
colonies below the Salt Lake Flats, the Salt Lake Valley and the Western
Rockies. These subterraneans had formerly established territorial
agreements with the Reptiloids and Grays before the aliens begun invading
their subterranean lands below the intermountain west en-masse in the early
1900's. The treaties were part of an attempt to stave off a possible
inter-species conflict, as skirmishes between the humanoids [Teros] and
reptiloids [Deros] within the cavern networks of North America had been
increasing since the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Because of a somewhat
non-exclusive collective-mind with which these humans interacted, it was
decided that one possible way to 'convert' the reptilians into becoming
beings of emotion and compassion was to allow them access to the group
consciousness. The reptiloids however, once given access, immediately began
taking advantage of the collective and used it to CONTROL the humans on a
subliminal basis. The ease with which this occurred may have been enhanced
by the fact that the Reptiloids and Grays were already operating as part of
a collective or group mind, one which was far more complex than the Ashtar
or Astarte collective itself which many of the 'Aghartians' depended on.
This suggests that the reptilian 'collective' or HIVE itself is absolutely
void of any and all care, concern or compassion for human beings.
Individual reptiloids operating distinct from the draconian collective
might however be 'tamed' by other collective-free humanoids in some cases
-- as some have reportedly been 'tamed' by the Andro-Pleiadean worlds. If
the non-humans could be severed from the 'collective' they might be
deprogrammed and reprogrammed so-to-speak and even attain individual
awareness and a degree of emotionalism. In such cases it would not be
advisable to give these creatures equal standing among humans, and absolute
subservience and monitoring should be enforced even if means were found to
sever them from the collective mind network. When dealing with the
reptilian forces, unconditional surrender should be first offered, and if
this is not accepted than direct military action would be justified
especially in light of the many permanent 'abductees' whom the Greys and
Reptiloids have taken captive [those who are still alive] to their
underground systems. Most of the treaties that the humanoids had made with
the reptiloids 'down under' have since been broken... especially following
the Groom Wars of 1975 and the Dulce Wars of 1979, during which time much
of the underground U.S. base networks [which were funded by American tax
dollars by the way] were taken over by the Grays. Some sources have implied
that the aliens took advantage of the chaos especially during the Dulce
wars and commenced to invade and conquer several of the older underground
colonies. This apparently led to a rift in the 'Ashtar' collective, with
many humanoids and hybrids splitting off and joining with the
Andro-Pleiadean Federation non-interventionists, and many reptiloids and
heartless humanoid agents splitting off and joining with the
interventionists of the Draco-Orion Empire. The Sirius-B system which --
aside from Arcturus and Sol -- has been the major center of 'Ashtar'
activity, has since been shaken by this split between the two opposing
Ashtarian factions and war had reportedly raged through the Sirius system
for several years, according to some 'contactees'... an apparent reflection
of the division within the underground networks of North America between
the Pleiadean-backed Sirian humanoids and Orion-backed Sirian reptiloids
which both had maintained operations within the underground levels before
the "Dulce Wars" broke out. The Dulce wars were just the mere tip of the
proverbial iceberg when we consider that the overall events which happened
at Dulce had a chain reaction effect throughout this whole sector of not
the galaxy. Before the division occurred, the reptiloids were invited to
take part in 'peace talks' in Telos and elsewhere as an act of good faith,
but the reptiloid-grey collectivists were more interested in expanding
their empire and feeding their insatiable appetite for conquest than they
were in making peace, although they agreed to peace treaties that they
never intended to keep for 'Trojan horse' manipulation purposes. There is a
remnant collaboration such as that taking place in the underground
facilities near Paradox Nevada where collectivist humanoids and reptiloids
from Sirius and Sol still maintain a collaboration of necessity -- in order
to establish a global control system, however a large number of humanoids
within the underground systems are at war with the
collectivist-interventionist Reptilian infiltrators who would otherwise
'assimilate' these humanoids into their collective through deception,
espionage and mind control. Now several contactees like Alex Collier, Ray
Keller, Stan Johnson and others are claiming that the conflicts in Sirius
between the Andro-Pleiadean backed Ashtar forces and the Draco-Orion backed
Ashtar forces -- which were infiltrated and commandeered by Draco-Orion
agents -- have now spread to the Sol system, as both stellar superpowers
have focused on this most strategic system, intent on protecting their
respective 'interests' here from being subverted by the other side. -

Q -- Does the Mt. Archuleta "shuttle system" connect with a shuttle system
which allegedly radiates from Mt. Shasta in northern California?

A -- Yes. Mt. Shasta is a major site of Alien - Elder Race - Reptilian Race
- Human meetings. Beginning Cleveland, Grover every president in U.S.
history have visited Telos City. Truman was supposed to have visited the
Lower Realms as a High Archon on Earth. He was supposed to have met the
King of the World there, and gave him the "Keys to the U.S.A." (Note:
Whether or not the reigning 'King' of the Agharti realms at the time had
benevolent or other motives, subjecting America to an outside super-power
without Congressional consent would be considered high treason. Although
unelected/appointed 'individuals' working within the
Executive-Military-Industrial branch of 'government' might choose to do so
of their own volition without Congressional or Senatorial consent, such an
act cannot apply to the 'America' which is based on the Declaration of
Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. There are
apparently two 'nations' occupying the United States, the traditional
grass-roots 'America' established by the founding fathers and led by the
'Electorate' government, and the fascist Bavarian-lodge-backed 'underground
nation' led by the 'Corporate' government which is contesting the original
'America' on its own soil. Some predict an inevitable civil [?] war between
the Electorate/Constitutional/Surface government of the U.S., and the joint
humanoid-reptiloid Corporate/National-Global Socialist/Underground New
World Order government, which incidentally was bought and paid for by
American taxpayers and other unsavory money-making projects. This war will
apparently provoke an armed United Nations / New World Order invasion of
the U.S.A. which, according to George Washington's famous 'vision' at
valley forge in 1777, will ultimately end with an American victory as a
result of Divine Intervention. Something like this may be inevitable if
FREEDOM is to be preserved on this world, and beyond. We should never
forget however that the NWO corporate elite and their draconian masters
intend to 'depopulate' the surface of this planet AND the underground
systems as well. According to one Navy intelligence source the 33-plus
Masons [there are allegedly several degrees above the 33rd degree which
interact directly with the draconians and are part of the interplanetary
initiatory lodges] intend to set the left-wing caverns and the right-wing
caverns against each other in order to depopulate the underground realms so
that they can impose absolute Bavarian-Draconian global control of 'both'
worlds. The 33+ and higher degrees according to this source intend to ride
out the inferno in super-secret fortified caverns while the 33rd and lower
degree masons and their respective left-wing and right-wing armies will be
left to die in the surface and subsurface wars. It may be that some of the
33+ Masons intend to ride-out the holocaust in their Alternative-3 bases on
the Moon and Mars, IF those bases are still active. Remember, the roots of
BOTH the 'right-wing' National Socialist AND the 'left-wing' Global
socialist agendas trace back to Bavaria. Isn't it interesting that the
legendary 'dragon' has TWO 'wings' -- a right wing and a left wing -- both
of which are controlled by a single 'beast'?. In essence, when it comes
right down to it the war is between the Judeo-Christian based
Constitutional Republic of America and the Luciferian-cult-based Socialist
empire of Bavaria. Both the right and left wing movements are Machiavellian
extremes created by the Bavarian Black Nobility ['Black' here being a
reference to something hidden that cannot be seen, and NOT skin color] in
order to foment global chaos. There are several claims that the
collaboration with the Reptilians began with the Luciferian cults of
Bavaria, and was later brought into America via the infiltration of the
Scottish Rite and the fascist core of the NSA-CIA. There may have
nevertheless been a reptilian presence below North America within the
caverns that dates back several centuries, however a MASSIVE reptilian
infestation of these underground systems seems to have begun near the
beginning of the 20th century. 'Mt. Archuleta' might be considered the
'capital' of the ALIEN segment of the 'secret' [Bavarian-Draconian] New
World Order government in America -- with the deep underground systems
beneath the Denver International Airport being the 'capital' of the HUMAN
segment of the secret government. - Branton). Truman received assurance to
new high tech knowledge, and victory over all enemies on Earth. He then was
introduced to Samaza and Khoach, aliens from Bootes and Tiphon [Draco],
both reptilian 'kings' or Embassadors. Truman updated the '100 Treaty'
[that began IN 1933, Roosevelt] and requested magnetic advance, space
knowledge and experiments. Khoach agreed, Samaza partially agreed. He
exchanged hostages for genetic experiments and magnetic advance, but vetoed
space and beam weaponry.



Q -- Did you notice any involvement of high-level Freemasons, Rosicrucians
or Jesuits within the underground installation and/or with the aliens?
(This question is based on the assumption made by some researchers that
many of the Masonic lodges were, beginning about 1776, infiltrated by the
Bavarian Illuminati. Much of the Masonic world is ultimately controlled by
the Bavarian-lodge-backed 33+ degrees of Scottish Rite Masonry, a 'Rite'
which according to early Masonic authority Rebold can be traced back to the
JESUIT college at Clermont in Paris -- a Rite which advocates the
destruction of national sovereignties in exchange for world government, the
destruction of religious and especially Judeo-Christian movements, and the
destruction of the family-structure to be replaced by 'State' control of
children, etc., as opposed to the more traditional Protestant-Christianized
YORK RITE of Masonry which the SCOTTISH RITE has attempted to subvert since
its inception into Masonry. This question was also based on claims from a
former 33rd degree Mason, James Shaw, that the Scottish Rite headquarters
in the "House of the Temple" -- which lies at the northern apex of the
pentagram-like street layout of Washington D.C. -- is filled with all kinds
of indications of serpent worship in the form of murals, carvings, statues,
etc., depicting serpentine figures. Actually, from what my sources tell me,
not only are there degrees beyond the 33rd degree, but the 33rd degree
itself is made up of two cores, an inner and outer core, the 33rd degree
and the 33+ degree. In the past when the 33rd degree initiation was reached
a potential initiate might have been given a Bible or a Cross and asked to
spit on it or desacrate it in some manner. If they refused to do this they
were told that they had made the "right decision" and remained in the outer
core of the 33rd degree, thinking that they had finally 'arrived'. If they
did or do commit this form of blasphemy then they are told that they have
made the "right decision", and they are sent on to the inner core of the
33+ degree, which is the springboard to the higher levels which interact
with the joint humanoid-reptiloid Ashtarian lodges or branches of the
'Serpent Cult' on other planets, within underground cities, and possibly
even other dimensions. One source informs me that former president George
Herbert Walker Bush -- who was at one time the HEAD of MJ-12 -- had
attained to the 42nd degree, however he may have attaned to even higher
levels since that time. I would guess that the one who holds the highest
level of initiation would be the 'dragon-king' of Draconis himself, or
whatever appellation the leader or the leaders of the Draconian Empire may
go by. - Branton):

A - Yes I did, but that is a loaded question, and I won't comment further.
I'm not a Mason, or member of any other secret fraternal group. There is
one organization I am a member of [in the U.S.A.]. That group is commonly
called the "Central Unit." It is a pleasure to tell you that I AM a member
of the "Sub-Galactic League" of Costa Rica.



Q -- Is there any truth to the allegations that the CIA/'Aliens' have
established 'bases' on the moon, and also Mars?

A -- I've HEARD that too, but I haven't seen proof with my own eyes. The
'aliens' do allegedly have bases on several moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
The CIA operates in other COUNTRIES, but I've never heard they operate on
other PLANETS (Note: Perhaps we should have referred to the CIA's superior
agency, the NSA, whose personnel reportedly pilot the "black-budget UFOs"
between the LUNA and DREAMLAND bases. - Branton).



Q -- Have you heard any hints or rumors suggesting that there may be lower
levels beneath the ULTRA-7 level of the Dulce base, and also, where these
might lead to and what they might consist of?

A -- YES. Your guess is as good as mine... Sure, there was lots of TALK but
that doesn't mean it's there. However, I will tell you I saw elevators that
were "off limits" unless you had an UMBRA or higher security clearance. At
that base, information is supplied to me at a "need to know" basis ONLY!
[My clearance was ULTRA-7]



Q -- Some insist that the U.S./Secret government has developed it's own
disk-craft based largely upon top secret antigravity experiments carried
out by the Nazi-German scientists during World War II. Have you heard
anything referring to this?

A -- When I was working in Photo-security, heard a lot of talk, never saw
the proof, but once in the Air Force I developed a roll of film that showed
a craft LIKE ADAMSKI'S, WITH A SWASTIKA ON THE SIDE. (Note: A letter from
'R.J.M.' of Pennsylvania dated 1-31-91 stated: "...I have a lot of UFO
videos. I also have 'THE SECRET LAND' [1947]. It shows Bunger's Oasis and
says they discovered warm land at the South Pole. One German author claims
the Nazi's had a photo-finish FIGHT with Byrd. At the end of the movie, it
says: 'Byrd's Intrepid 4,000 met and defeated ANTARCTICA'S TOUGHEST
BATTALIONS.' I don't think they were talking about the weather..." Another
source has stated that there were loses on BOTH sides, and the Battle for
Antarctica against the Nazi's "Last Battalion" -- which had fortified
themselves in underground bases below the mountains of Neu Schwabenland,
Antarctica -- ended in a stalemate. Question: Why would Adolph Hitler and
Eva Braun commit suicide after Hitler had spent so much energy executing
over 5000 Nazi officials whom he 'suspected' were behind his assassination
attempt at the 'Wolf' bunker, especially if he had a way out via a secret
Nazi South Polar base? The March 18, 1994 issue of THE PLAIN DEALER
[Cleveland, Ohio] carried an AP story titled "DOCTORS FIND BURNT BODY COULD
NOT BE HITLER'S". Excerpts include: "...French forensic experts say the
charred corpse said to be Hitler's is not his body... experts FALSIFIED
verification reports ordered by Josef Stalin to APPEASE the Soviet
dictator.... the body is actually that of an unknown German male. [The
forensic experts] spent more than two years analyzing the autopsy reports
prepared by Soviet coroners in the days following [the] surrender of the
Third Reich in 1945... the body [said to be Hitler's] had an extra tooth
and only one testicle... no German doctor who had examined Hitler before
his death ever mentioned either anomaly." This is also interesting when we
consider that the well-known 'abductee', Barney Hill, remembered the
following experience under regressive hypnosis as recorded in the
paranormal encyclopedia, "MYSTERIES OF MIND, SPACE & TIME". Barney and his
wife Betty were abducted by gray-skinned humanoids "from Zeta Reticuli".
HOWEVER, one of the 'beings' on the craft was described by Barney Hill
under regressive hypnosis in the following words which are taken from
p.1379 of the encyclopedia: "...another figure has an EVIL face... HE LOOKS
LIKE A GERMAN NAZI. HE'S A NAZI... HIS EYES! HIS EYES. I'VE NEVER SEEN EYES
LIKE THAT BEFORE!" Remember that this occurred nearly 15 years after Europe
had supposedly been "de-Nazified". There seems to be an Antarctic
connection with the Dulce scenario as well as other possible 'Nazi'
connections: German 'tourists' scouring New Mexico, exploring mines and
caves and buying up land and mineral rights just before the outbreak of
WWII; the Nazi-connected CIA's involvement and their placement of several
Nazi S.S. agents -- who had been brought into the U.S. via Project
Paperclip -- within the Dulce and other underground facilities; the
involvement of secret 'Bavarian' lodges at Dulce; and the possible
Antarctican-Dulce connection to 'Alternative 003'. Another interesting
connection is the fact that the secret Nazi teams involved in the
construction and operation of the underground bases below the mountains of
Neu Schwabenland and elsewhere in Antarctica were called ULTRA teams. ULTRA
is also the code-name for the DULCE base! Also there seems to be a direct
connection between the Dulce base and the Montauk base in Long Island --
which was/is[?] reputedly jointly operated by the Draconian Reptiloids,
Orion Greys and the Bavarian Thule Society which had backed the Nazi
agenda. - Branton)



Q -- Tom, did you have access to the alien craft? Were you ever inside any
of them?

A -- Yes, I frequently saw them in the garages, there are quite a few of
them. The main fleet is stored at Los Alamos. Yes, I entered several
crafts. There were two things that stick in my mind, the odd spongy feeling
of the floors, and the unusual pinkish purple color of the lighting. The
crew stated the floor becomes ridged in flight, and the purple tint of the
lighting changes to bright blue white. The entire inside of the air craft
are scaled down in size, when compared to the average human. The halls were
curved and narrow, but some how, when inside it appears bigger than it
looks. Certain areas, the outermost sections, almost felt and looked alive.
I was never taken up in one.



Q -- Can you give me more information on the reptilian race, what do they
do on the sixth level? [The area called Nightmare Hall.]

A -- The worker caste does the daily chores, mopping the latex floors,
cleaning the cages, bringing food to the hungry people and other species.
It is their job to formulate the proper mixture for the type one and type
two beings that the Draco Race has created. The working caste work at the
labs as well as at the computer banks. Basically speaking, the reptilian
races are active at all levels of the Dulce Base. There are several
different 'races' of aliens that work on the east section of level six (No
doubt some collaborating 'Nordic' factions included. - Branton). That
section is commonly called "the alien section." The Draco are the
undisputed masters of the 5-6-7 levels. The humans are second in command of
those levels. I had to ARGUE with one large Draconian 'boss' frequently.
His name is difficult to verbalize, Khaarshfashst [pronounced throaty
kkhhah-sshh-fahsh-sst]. I usually called him 'Karsh,' and he hated it. The
Draconian leaders are very formal when talking to the human race. These
ancient beings consider us a lower race. Karsh called me "Leader Castello,"
but it was used in a sarcastical way. However the worker caste is friendly
enough, as long as you allow them to speak first. They will answer if you
address them. They are very cautious beings, and consider most humans to be
hostile. They always seem surprised when they found many of the humans were
open and trustworthy. There is no fraternizing with the aliens off hours.
It is forbidden to speak to any alien race [in the halls or an elevator]
without a clear business oriented reason. Humans can talk to humans, and
aliens can speak to aliens, but that is as far as it goes. At the work
site, however, it's different. There is "free speech" in the labs. The
camaraderie found in the labs also reaches the computer banks section. In
those areas, everybody talks to anybody. However, everything changes the
minute you cross the threshold of the hall. Instantly, all conversations
become strictly formal. Hard as it was, several times I had to arrest some
one, simply because they spoke to an alien. It's a strange place.



Q -- Exactly what first made you aware that something was wrong at Dulce?
Seems to me that a place as obviously horrible as this one wouldn't need an
Einstein to know that this is a CRIME site! What took you so long? Are you
the guy who blew the whistle?

A -- There are several things you should know about. I took an oath, under
the penalty of death, that no matter what I saw or heard I would never
divulge the information. Also, I signed a waiver that states I would
willingly give up my life if I was found guilty of 'treason'. At the Dulce
Base treason is "ANYTHING that mentions the details of daily operations at
this facility, when outside the confinement of the this base." When I first
arrived, a "need to know" policy was in effect. The story the 'honchos'
told us was that "this is a Tri-Biotransfer Facility with Advanced
Technology, doing advanced adventurous methodology for medical and mental
gains." Which is a fancy way of saying they do really risky things with
human life just to see what would happen. If a medical cure happens, it
will be heralded on the surface of the earth as a marvelous new cure,
saying it was found after years of research at some well known medical lab.
The real story of the cure is never explained. After all, the Dulce Base IS
A SECRET FACILITY! These people are very good at what they do. They do not
tell the truth about the unfortunate people that end up in "Nightmare
Hall." I worked with aliens. With that in mind, you should get the idea of
the secrecy and the security at that place. Yes, I know this was not the
usual hospital type job site, but in the beginning I 'bought' the whole
package. I was reminded daily by intercom, in the elevators, that "this
site does high risk advanced medical and drug testing to cure insanity,
please, never speak to the inmates, it can destroy years of work." I'm
sensible, when doctors say don't speak to them, who was I to destroy the
delicate situation? But one man some how caught my eye. He repeatedly
stated that he was George S---- and that he had been kidnapped and he was
sure someone was searching for him. I don't know why he sticks in my mind,
I found I was remembering his face, thinking he sure didn't look or sound
insane, but many inmates said that. The next weekend I convinced a friend
of mine, a cop, to run a check on the guy, saying I had a run in with him
and was curious. I didn't mention the base at all. It was a sickening
feeling when the computer confirmed that George S. was missing. What's
worse, the cops thought he was just another guy that got tired of the daily
grind and split. That was the beginning. Am I the one that blew the
whistle? No. The next Monday, I searched for George, but he was gone. There
were no records that explained what happened to him. It was another
security officer that came to me saying he and some lab workers wanted an
off duty meeting at one of the tunnels, [off the record]. Curiosity took
over and I said OK. That night, about nine men showed up. They said they
knew they were risking me turning them in but they wanted to show me some
things they thought I should see. One by one they showed records that
proved many inmates were missing people. There were newspaper clippings,
and even photos that they had some how smuggled into the base. They hoped
to smuggle them back out, without me turning them in to the honchos. I
could see the fear in their faces as they spoke. One man stated he would
rather lose his life by trying, than to lose his soul by not doing anything
at all. It was that remark that turned the tide. I told them about George
and the things I found out about him. After a few hours we pledged to
attempt to expose the Dulce Base.



Q -- The name Nightmare Hall is descriptive, but surely there was a
'regular' name, what was it called in the manuals?

A -- In the manuals it was called "The Vivarium". It describes Dulce Base
as a "secured facility for tending bio-forms of all types." In their report
it is retold as "a private subterranean bio-terminal park, with
accommodations for animals, fish, fowl, reptile, and mankind." After SEEING
this 'park' the name Nightmare Hall is far more accurate than the manual.
The 'accommodations' for the inmates at Nightmare Hall fall short of the
pretty picture the manual describes.



Q -- You mentioned one reptilian leader, Khaarshfashst, do you know any
thing about him, like where is he from? Is he from Earth or some other
planet?

A -- His name means "keeper of the laws". They recieve their name after
they reach the "age of awareness". They do not recognize time as an
important factor in "being aware" the way humans do. Upon their "age of
awareness" they are cognitive of the station or position they are destined
to fulfill. At that time they chose or allow someone to choose their name.
Their name will include the position they hold and several personally
chosen letters. Each letter has a personal meaning, known only to the alien
and the one that chose their name. Since Karsh's name means keeper of the
laws his name includes kaash [memory or keep, base word for 'Akashic'
record] and fashst [law, base word fast or bind]. Reptilians choose to be
not only private but secretive of the location of their natal place. To
them birth, or emergence of life, is considered as one of the sacred rites
of life. They consider Earth or Terra their "home planet", but several
reptoids discuss several star maps. Most of those stars were within the
Milky Way. Within those star maps lies the stars and planets of the Planets
of the Allegiance. Earth being one of the planets in their trade routes. If
any human asked clear questions about the Allegiance, the Aliens referred
the questions to the Draco. The Draco in turn, referred the questions to
their supervisor [me]. I did not have that information about the stars,
because information was supplied on a "need to know" basis. I didn't 'need'
that information.



Q -- Did any of the working caste join in the revolt? Could you give me
some names?

A -- A few of the reptilian janitorial crew let us know that THEY knew WE
were attempting to sabotage the work going on in the sixth and seventh
levels. One of them, with the name Schhaal, secretly formed a small group
of reptoids with the same mind set as my group (Take note of the similarity
between this scenario and the NBC mini-series "V", which is now available
on video cassette after years of non-availability. I have it on good
authority that the original author of the "V" idea was an investigator who
knew Thomas Castello on a personal basis. He had connections in Hollywood
and had written a motion picture script, which was in turn seen and
'borrowed' without permission by an NBC employee and re-written as a
mini-series. The show was based on

reptilian humanoids from Sirius-B who had come to earth under the guise of
benevolent human-like space brothers to bring a new order of universal
peace. In reality they had a secret agenda to rape planet earth of her
resources and steal her people for biological sustenance. This agenda was
being contested by a human resistance who refused to fall for the
reptilian's facade, and these resistors were in turn working with a secret
fifth-column of reptilians who did not agree with their leaders' agenda for
planet earth. Could this mini-series have had an actual basis in a bizarre
reality? - Branton). Sshhaal took upon himself the danger of informing me.
He was as open as is possible in a unique situation. On the day I found out
about it, I was inspecting a camera near an exit tunnel. He approached,
stooped down (the tall reptiloids average about 7-8 ft. in height according
to most witnesses - Branton), seemingly scraping some non-existent dirt,
and he quietly said, "A few of us agreed that you are singular in your
interest in missing-human reports. If true, walk away. I'll reach you. If
it's untrue, destroy my life now!" My heart almost leaped out of my chest,
but I silently walked toward one of the wide halls. For the rest of my life
I'll remember those words! It was the first time I KNEW reptilians could
have individual thoughts and opinions! Basically, they formed a uniform
front with a small variety of interests. Or at least, that was what we had
thought. It was a couple days before I heard from him again. As he walked
beside me in the sixth level's infamous hall, I heard him say "Enter the
exit tunnel on the sixth level, north, after your shift." The next few
hours were long and filled with thoughts of betrayal, or worse, but I
shouldn't have worried. I contacted one of the original nine [resistance]
men, and let him know, just in case. Gordon wanted to go with me, but I
convinced him to wait a few feet from the exit and pretend he was having
trouble with his cart [electric, like a golf cart]. When I got there, there
were three of them. SSHHAAL formerly introduced FAHSSHHAA and HUAMSSHHAA
[name base word is SSHHAA or assist]. With that, I quickly grabbed Gordon
from the hall and the five of us talked and walked in the dark tunnels
about three hours. After that day, the joined resistance group got bigger
and bolder. Ultimately, it ended when a military assault was initiated via
the exit tunnels and they executed anybody on their list, human or
reptilian. We fought back, but none of the working caste had weapons, nor
did the human lab workers. Only the security force and a few computer
workers had flash guns. It was a massacre. Every one was screaming and
running for cover. The halls and tunnels were filled as full as possible.
We believe it was the Delta Force [because of the uniforms and the method
they used] that chose to hit at shift change, an effort that killed as many
as named on their list (NOTE: If Thomas Castello is correct in his
assertion, then based on his overall revelations, as well as the
revelations of others such as Robert Lazar, Phil Schneider, etc., the Dulce
Wars were the result of at least five overlapping factors or scenarios
which converged at more or less the same time or played into each other.
This may have also involved a conflict of interest within MJ12 itself, and
apparently involved different security forces including the Delta Force,
Black Berets, Air Force Blue Berets, Secret Service, FBI Division Five, CIA
stormtroopers and Dulce Base security. The various factors which seem to
have played into the Dulce wars would include animosity towards the Greys
for their slaughter of several scientists and security personnel in the
Groom Wars below Area 51 three years earlier as described by former MJ12
Special Studies Group agent Michael Wolf; accidental [?] encounters between
aliens and human construction workers and security forces near Dulce as
described by Phil Schneider; an attack on the Dulce base 'resistance' that
was apparently ordered by die-hard collaborators in deep-level intelligence
as described by Thomas Castello; an attempt to rescue several of our best
scientists who had been captured by the aliens after they had discovered
the "Grand Deception" involving a violation of the established treaties,
that is the permanent abduction of thousands of humans to the Dulce and
other bases for God only knows what purposes, as described by John Lear --
could it be that MJ12 / PI40 was unaware of these abductees, yet their
superior agency the BLACK MONK / MAJIC agency was aware and had agreed to
an actual exchange of human life for technology?; and another factor would
involve a dispute over whether human security personnel could carry flash
guns as opposed to machine guns. All of these were apparently contributing
factors to the 'altercations' which raged throughout the Dulce Base
beginning in 1979. - Branton). We, to this day, do not know who BETRAYED
us. Gordon Ennery ran beside me as we ran into the third level exit
tunnels, and he died when several bullets slammed into his back. I
vaporized that assassin and kept running. And I'm still running. Gordon
will be remembered.



Q -- Tell me more about the flash gun. Is it difficult to operate, or is it
like the weapon on Star Trek, that can stun or kill on different modes?

A -- It is an advanced beam weapon that can operate on three different
phases. Phase one, like Star Trek, can stun and maybe kill, if the person
has a weak heart. On phase two, it can levitate ANYTHING no matter what it
weighs. Phase three is the SERIOUS BUSINESS mode. It can be used to
paralyze anything that lives, animal, human, alien and plant. On the higher
position on the same mode, it can create a TEMPORARY DEATH. I assure you,
any doctor would certify that person is dead, but their life essence
lingers in some strange limbo, some kind of terrible state of non-death. In
one to five hours the person will revive, slowly; first the bodily
functions will begin, and in a few minutes, consciousness followed with
full awareness. In that mode the alien scientists re-program the human
brain and plant false information. When the person awakes, he 'recalls' the
false information as information he gained through life experience. There
is no way for a person to learn the truth. The human mind 'remembers' and
believes completely the false data. If you attempt to inform them, they
would laugh or get angry. They NEVER believe the truth. Their mind always
forgets the experience of re-programming. You asked if the flash gun is
difficult to operate. A two year old child could use it with one hand. It
resembles a flash light, with black glass conical inverted lens. On the
side are three recessed knobs in three curved grooves. Each knob is sized
differently. The closer the knob to the hand the less the strength. It's
that simple. Each knob has three strengths also, with automatic stops at
each position. The strongest position will vaporize any thing that lives.
That mode is so powerful it will leave NO TRACE of what it vaporized.



Q -- Is the weapon called a Flash Gun or is there a different name in the
manuals?

A -- Everybody calls them Flash Guns, or more commonly "The Flash" or "my
Flash" when talking about it. In the manual it is first introduced as the
ARMORLUX Weapon. After that, it is explained as the Flash Gun.



Q -- What type of security is found at the Dulce Base? What else is used
against espionage or unauthorized entry?

A -- I'll mention a few, but it would be nearly impossible to cover it all.
The weapon, besides the Flash Gun, mostly used is a form of sonic. Built in
with each light fixture [and most camcorders] is a device that could render
a man unconscious in seconds with nothing more than a silent tone. At Dulce
there also are still and VCR cameras, eye print, hand print stations,
weight monitors, lasers, ELF and EM equipment, heat sensors and motion
detectors and quite a few other methods. There is no way you could get very
far into the base. If you made it to the second level, you would be spotted
within fifteen feet. More than likely, you would become an inmate and never
see the light of the surface world again. If you were 'lucky', you would be
re-programmed and become one of the countless spies for the Ruling Caste.



Q -- According to certain reports, the Dulce Base is host to [other] aliens
that live in level five. Is that true? Can the humans freely roam or meet
one-to-one in the halls or is some type of protocol in effect?

A -- There is protocol from the first time you enter the base and it MUST
be followed every time you SEE an alien there. From the working caste, to
the visiting aliens, to the Ruling Caste, there is a never ending check
list of rules, law, and strict protocol. There is never a chance to roam on
the fifth level. The alien housing area is off limits to any human. The Hub
is surrounded by security, arsenal, military and CIA\FBI sections. The area
past the security is one of the most secured areas because it houses so
many classified files. The entire east side of the fifth level is off
limits except for security personnel holding ULTRA-7 [security clearance]
or higher. The garage on the west side of the fifth level requires ULTRA-4
clearance.



Q -- Is there proof available that could confirm the allegations of the
underground base, or are we just supposed to believe you?

A -- Many people have asked that one. No, I don't expect people to believe
with blind faith, there is tangible proof that has been seen, felt or
inspected by quite a few folks. I'm in no position to go on a lecture
circuit to explain to every person on a one-to-one basis. I am trying to
stay alive. All I can do is state again, that Dulce is a SECRET FACILITY.
They work HARD to make sure nobody can find the place. If everyone could
easily find it, it wouldn't be a SECRET facility. I've explained the
extreme security methods they use. There is other proof available. There
are five sets of copies in five different boxes in five different locations
that hold complete proof of every thing I have tried to explain. Here is a
list of contents of each box (delivered into the safe-keeping of five
individuals known only to Thomas Castello and to the individual recipients
- Branton): (A) 27 sheets of 8 x 10 photographs of Aliens, creatures, cages
and vats. (B) One silent candid video tape, begins on the computer banks,
shows the vats, multi shots of Nightmare Hall, two shots of Greys, one shot
of the Terminal showing sign saying 'To Los Alamos' and about thirty
seconds of the Shuttle train arriving. (C) 25 pages of diagrams, chemical
formulas and schematics of alien equipment. (D) A copy of the new treaty
complete with signatures. (E) 2 pages of original Alien documents signed by
Ronald Reagan [as governor of California], each page includes Reagan's
signature. The ORIGINAL set mentioned above is sealed in one piece oxygen
free heavy plastic box. That set includes: (A) 27 sheets of 8 x 10 WITH
original negatives (B) The video tape, AND the original micro film, from
which the video tape was copied. (C) The 25 original pages of diagrams
[with notations], formulas, alien equipment schematics plus the schematics
for the Flash Gun and MY Flash Gun. (D) The treaty with Reagan's signature
plus seven other political signatures and four Alien signatures. The
working Flash Gun in that box is an extremely dangerous weapon. In the
wrong hands, there is no limit on the danger it could inflict. That proof
must be protected. But when placed in the hands of certain government
agencies, it would not be treated as proof for an Alien visitation. That
government branch KNOWS THE TRUTH and they publicly lie. Think about it
like this, do you KNOW, for certain proof, that George Washington lived? Or
do you believe what other people SAID about him? There is no one alive that
saw with their own eyes what is claimed about him. You judge all you know
about him by what other people SAID. Columbus SAID there is a new land, and
it was found. I am SAYING there are aliens in several underground bases in
this country and terrible things happen in those places. If I die, before
it is proven, search for proof (after all, the Dulce Base and the other
bases aren't going anywhere. Unlike UFO's themselves they are not "here
today and gone tomorrow". If they are there, then there are bound to be
some indications of the fact. - Branton). Demand that the government admit
it. If enough people demand it, they WILL find a way to explain the base,
or at least explain why they must keep it secret. There are MANY people
that work at the Dulce Base that know me. I am challenging those co-workers
to speak up, at least anonymously. Send a letter, or a telegram [or fax] to
confirm what I have explained. In the name of the brave men, woman,
children and aliens that died TRYING to let the public know what is going
on at the Dulce Facility, EXPOSE that horrid place before thousands more
innocent people are tortured and die unspeakable deaths.



Q -- What about the elevators, do they drop from the surface to the seventh
level in a couple of seconds? Do you know anything about them? Are they
electrically lifted? Every where on the surface world there are elevators
made by Otis Elevator Company. Does that company make the elevators at
Dulce?

A -- I failed to notice what brand was available in the elevators at the
base. I could tell you that there is no elevator anywhere at Dulce that
drops from the surface to the seventh level. The security blue prints show
the levels are 'stepped' down. Each level drops one floor only. Not even
the Hub has an express elevator. After the third level, not only would you
change elevators, you are weighed and color coded, before you re-enter the
car. All the elevators are magnetically controlled, even lights in
elevators, as well as all lights on all levels are magnetically induced.
The light bulbs are not the type bought on the surface, but a totally
different type of light system. The illumination found there is a closer
match to natural sunlight than any artificial light on the surface world.
The shape of the elevators is unique. If you have ever seen a Tupperware
sugar bowl, you could see the shape copied in the elevator. Sort of like an
open ended oval with another half oval on each side. The elevator shaft
matches the shape perfectly. The magnetic controls are in the half oval
shape. If you could stand in or close to the half ovals, you would feel the
slight pull of the power of those magnets. The motion is smooth and silent,
there is a nearly unnoticed surge when the motion starts or stops. There
are no cables needed, because the lift is magnetic, not electric. Since
there are no cables in the elevator cars there is no chance of them
falling.



Q -- I understand that certain groups of cleared individuals in the
government are collaborating with alien groups. Is it known how many groups
and of what type they are working with?

A -- I don't know how many groups or what type they are working with.



Q -- A mysterious security man calling himself agent "Yellow Fruit" says he
worked at Groom Lake [Area 51]. The Security Officer states that he's been
in contact with benevolent aliens, at the Groom Lake facility -- are you
aware of such a group?

A -- Yellow Fruit is one of the slang names for Yellow Jack [or Yellow
Flag] that shows quarantine and caution in the labs. There are so many
different slang names at Dulce labs that meant quarantine that the workers
published a booklet to show the meanings. At Dulce, Yellowfruit are the lab
workers [so called from the yellow light outside the decontamination
chambers]. Banana is the older workers, lemon is the new guys and so on.



Q -- Is there an alien installation under Groom Lake or Papoose Lake at the
Nevada Test Site, and are they conducting biological research at these
sites?

A -- Most of the stuff at the Groom facility deals with defense, but there
is a large storage area in the tunnels that holds thousands of alien craft
parts. From what I have heard, the medical tests at the Nevada Test Site
are conducted by and for the Navy.



Q -- According to my sources, the Aerospace companies have a secret
underground installation in the Tehachapi Mountains, not far from Rosamond
near Edwards AFB. Insiders refer to the Tahachapi Installment as the Ant
Hill. They are experimenting with advanced technology such as antigravity
disks. Some have seen basketball sized floating orbs patrol the facility,
do you have any further information on this?

A -- The California mountains [Tehachapi, Chocolate, Shasta, etc.] all have
alien security methods and equipment. The basketball size orbs are used for
unmanned patrol. They are silent, but when photographing living beings
there is a humming sound. The glow that emits light is magnetic aura. This
[light] is in the visible spectrum [3900 angstroms]. You can see the light,
but the light does not reflect off any thing.



Q -- Is there anything you can tell me about the moon - alien
installations? Atmosphere? U.S. bases?

A -- There is not much I can tell you there. I wasn't in the Lunar Program.
I heard there was a LOT of equipment sent to the moon between 1959-1964
under "Project Whiteout".



Q -- How do the aliens use magnetism? Do they use it as an energy source?
Is there more we need to know about magnetism?

A -- The aliens use magnetics for EVERY THING! They use magnetics as the
basic structure for their energy source. The more you learn about
magnetics, the better. The Human Race calls them 'magnets', the Aliens call
them 'lodestar'. They have been harvesting lodestars [lodestones] for
centuries. Not only that, they want ALL the magnetic power on Earth. They
intend to continue harvesting that power, now and in the future. As long as
we were only using magnetic power as an oddity, there was no problem. But
in recent times, the human race has begun using magnetic power and finding
more ways to utilize that commodity. There was a treaty made. In the
original treaty, the human race (or those who supposedly 'represented' the
human race, if you could call it that - Branton) didn't mind at all, 'we'
considered magnets as hardly more than useless. As people searched for
another source for power, we turned to magnetics. The aliens wanted a new
treaty. What could we offer? They chose land, underground mining rights,
animals and humans for new experiments. The general public NEVER KNEW about
the treaty. The governmental [Bavarian cultist] heads of the world chose
another treaty in 1933. This time 'we' got high-tech knowledge in exchange.
So now, the more we use magnetics, the more they claim humans, and the
lands of the U.S.A. We were 'sold' in exchange for magnets. If you doubt
it, look around -- there are token companies that 'really' utilize magnetic
power, but are depending on electric based or ceramic magnets, NOT lodestar
[magnetic oxide of iron] based magnets.



Q -- What do the aliens do with the cow blood and other parts from
mutilated animals? Do they need these fluids for research or survival?

A -- The aliens use the blood and body parts for formula to keep them alive
[their food] and for use in the growing vats, and for the artificial wombs.
Plasma and amniotic fluid are the two most vital ingredients for their
lives. Also, the 'sap' of some plants can keep them alive for months. Most
of the plants are parasitic in nature, but red grapes and okra plants can
also be added to the formula to keep them alive, if they have no 'regular'
formula.



Q -- Female abductees report being inseminated by aliens. Are they trying
to hybridize our species?

A -- Yes, they are breeding slave-warriors for the upcoming war with the
alien races (the Nordic races? - Branton). The serpentine races are in
orbit around Earth, Venus and Mars.



Q -- Abductees have reported that the aliens can pass their bodies and that
of the abductee through window glass. Is this a feat of magic achieved by
advanced technology or is it a psychic power?

A -- The aliens have mastered atomic matter. They can go through walls like
we go through water! It is not magic, just physics. We can learn to do the
same thing. It has to do with controlling atoms at will.



Q -- Are you in communication with benevolent aliens or do you have
contacts that are? If you are, can you tell us how we can communicate with
their teams?

A -- I am not at liberty to discuss communications with any friendly alien
life forms. I can tell you there is a friendly factor active in Costa Rica,
I am in direct communication with that factor. I am an active member of the
Sub-Galactic League of Costa Rica. This organization, using a small
satellite dish, a television set and ham radio equipment reached this
factor. I might suggest that by using similar equipment and a low band
frequency, you may reach the same factor.



Q -- Do you stay in the U.S.A., or do you live abroad? Do you work now? I
know you have been on the run for several years.

A -- Yeah, quite a few years. I visit the U.S., but it's really dangerous
when I do. I've lived in several countries. I spent a few years in Mexico,
working as a mercenary soldier. It's rough work, frequently living in the
bush, eating what ever I can find. I spent time in South America, fighting
the drug cartel [it's not the citizens, it's the secret government, top
officials AND American alphabet boys -- CIA, FBI, etc.]. I settled in Costa
Rica, 'bought' a small house in Limon. Actually it is a shanty that some
one abandoned. I paid the equivalency of $11 to one of the local constables
for the right to call it 'mine'. My name changes when I think some one is
asking questions. I've worked in one of the underground bases near the
Panama border. It's in the mountains, not very far from a passive but
'active' volcano. It is not as fancy as Dulce, but the people are
wonderful.



Q -- What is the best city in Costa Rica for an American to visit and maybe
move to live?

A -- None of them are worth anything [by comparison], but I like Limon.
There is a real culture shock when you get past the tourist sections.
Inside the urban areas, it's not so bad, but away from the beaten path the
picture changes. There are no improvements in the shanties, no sewers,
plumbing, or paved roads. But if you stay in the cities, and you don't mind
the big difference in the cultures, the countries have a lot to offer. Nice
weather, great beaches and beautiful trees with fruit growing everywhere.



Q -- Are there any other security level names [other than 'secret' - 'top
secret' - 'ultra']?

A -- There are many other security clearances, here are a few, UMBRA,
STELLAR, G2-7Z, TRIAD, UMT [Universal Military Training] and UMS [Universal
Military Service], ASTRAL and SUB-ASTRAL. UMBRA is higher than ULTRA (Note:
It may be conceivable that some of the higher security clearances are used
for the joint human-alien interstellar projects. For instance Whitley
Streiber described an abduction to another planetary sphere where he
encountered ancient ruins, aliens and human personnel dressed in military
kackies and carrying camcorders, automatic weapons, etc. Obviously such
personnel would have to possess an extremely high security classification,
such as "Universal Military Service" for instance? The joint
alien-illuminati "alternative-3" projects have reportedly taken part in
joint offensive operations against the peaceful residents of other worlds,
this according to a couple who 'defected' from the alternative-3 movement
after an agent from the 'Federation' warned them about such atrocities. -
Branton)



Q -- Ever see a badge with 'MAJI'?

A -- No.



Q -- Since you have lived in Spanish speaking countries, it's obvious that
you are bilingual. What other languages do you speak?

A -- Other than English, the only other languages I speak are Spanish and
Eusshu, the common language [alien] spoken at Dulce. I speak Spanish
fluently, and enough Eusshu to keep my self out of trouble. Shortly after I
first transferred to Dulce, I took a crash course in Eusshu. Any one that
plans to spend more than one week working at that base, they are wise to
learn the basics. Other wise, you are required to wait for an escort to get
around. All the signs at that base are written in the universally
recognized symbolic language. Eusshu is logical and easy to learn.



Q -- What are the eating habits of the aliens? Are they carnivores?

A -- That depends weather they are one of the gray worker caste, one of the
reptilian worker caste, or one of the higher developed Draconian Leaders.
Also, the created beings, replicants, type two being, or one of the really
strange [genetic] mixtures. I'll try to cover a little of each. The formula
includes amniotic water, plasma and several other body parts [raw, usually
bovine]. This nearly clear mixture with a texture of pureed peaches, and
almost in that color. The grays make the attempt not to 'eat' around the
humans, because the odor of it is VERY unpleasant to ANY human. They can
spend days or even weeks between feedings. The working caste of the
reptilians eat meat, insects and a large variety of plants including
vegetables and fruit. They prefer their meat raw and very fresh, but have
learned to enjoy some cooked meat like rare beef steak (Note: According to
many abductees, the reptiloids are not above eating human flesh. It has
been said that they prefer flesh that is young enough to be free of toxins,
yet old enough to be imbued with a lifetime of accumulated "emotional
energy residue" which is resident within the human body. Some abductees
claim that certain reptilian factions have such complex bio-technologies
that they are able to remove a human's soul-energy-matrix and place it in a
containment 'box', and use the controlled 'body' for whatever purpose they
choose. Some abductees also insist that in some cases the reptiloids can
create a cloned duplicate of a person in a short amount of time through
time warping and replace the soul-energy-matrix of a person back into the
new cloned body if their disappearance from society would otherwise create
too many problems. This way they can ingest the emotional-residue-imbued
original body without the abductee realizing [in most cases] that their
soul-memory-matrix has been transferred to a cloned body, because they
would have experienced a total 'soul-matrix' energy transfer and a
suppression of any memories relating to the transfer process. The cloned
bodies do not possess the integrated emotional residue that the
vampirialistic reptiloids apparently crave and find intoxicating in a
similar manner as a human on earth who is addicted to hard drugs. -
Branton). Unlike the Greys, they eat frequently and usually carry or send
for food on their breaks. The Ruling Caste is SECRETIVE about their foods.
They have created several dietary myths that they carefully embellish when
the chance arrives. One of their favorite legends involves one of their
ancestors' ability to eat an entire flock of geese in one setting. They
RARELY eat in sight of any other species. They carefully choose their food,
then carry their meal to their quarters. It was only when dignitaries
arrive at the base did they join their meals. They enjoy the same foods we
do, and they have been seen secretly munching on a freshly found snail. The
"human looking" replicants eat some cooked vegetables. They rely on
vitamins and liquid protein for sustenance. If they have to eat on the
surface world, they can eat what ever they are served, but as soon as
possible they regurgitate. Their digestive systems frequently fail to
process the food properly. The engineered beings have a special diet,
created for their dietary needs. The mixture includes several organ foods
blended with plasmatic fluids, amniotic liquids and parasitiplasm
materials. These unique 'animals' also enjoy occasional green plants,
usually grasses or lettuce. The creatures that are designed to become
warriors, eat protein filled liquids.



Q -- In the Dulce Papers, copper seems to be high on the importance list.
In what methods is copper used?

A -- One of the main uses of copper at Dulce is containment of the magnetic
flow, magnets are used every where at that base. The infamous vats'
interiors are lined with copper, and the exterior walls are clad with
stainless steel. The mechanical arm that stirs the liquid is made of a
copper alloy. Other uses include dietary needs in a few of the transbiotic
beings. There are several specially made cells or rooms built first with
lead, then magnetic steel then clad in copper. It is in those cells on the
Fourth Level that contain living aural essence. This essence is what you
would call [a captured disembodied] 'soul' or..."astral body". (Note: This
may tie-in with the reports of certain remote-viewing "astral spies" who
claim to have "projected" into underground facilities like Dulce New Mexico
or Pine Gap Australia, only to have close encounters with these astral
containment fields, or have been captured by the same and released after
being 'interrogated' via super-sensitive electronic equipment. In one case
an Australian remote-viewer was probing the Pine Gap facility where he also
"saw" three other astral spys.

The magnetic or astral body of one of these people had been captured by
such a containment field, which really disturbed him. This man, Robert,
also saw Greys and Reptiloids operating in the deeper levels of Pine Gap
and also Nordic-type humans who were apparently captives and who did NOT
seem to be very happy about being there. - Branton)



Q -- Growing multi-species beings, blood formulas and human parts in vats
sounds like a bad plot to a science fiction movie. The doctors and
scientists of the world claim you can't mix the species (Note: Naturally
this may be true, however through genetic bioengineering and gene-splicing
this has apparently been accomplished to some extent - Branton). The
concepts mentioned in the Dulce Papers sounds far fetched. Could you
provide information that the average "surface world" reader could
understand about similar things?

A -- The doctors and scientists on the SURFACE world may say that, but
underground, away from the prying eyes of ethics boards, they DO GROW
TRANS-GENUS BEINGS! There is a lot of written material available at
libraries. One of the best sources is an easy to read book published back
in 1969, by Prentice-Hall International, with the title of "THE SECOND
GENESIS, THE COMING CONTROL OF LIFE" by Albert Rosenfelt. In this book,
they discuss "animals that may be especially bred to supply genetically
reliable organs for people." -- and "...the use of fetal or embryonic
material from which adult sized organs and tissues may be grown..." Also he
discusses the fact that embryonic tissue has no immunological activity,
therefore it cannot provoke the defense mechanism in the recipient. IT WILL
JOIN THE BODY NOT AS A FOREIGN ANTIGEN, BUT AS A NATURAL PROTEIN. He
further discusses solitary generation, commonly called virgin birth, but
also known as parthenogenesis. With one "virgin birth" in 1.6 million
births average ON THE SURFACE of the world, in Dulce that rate is reversed.
Occasionally, a "normally born" human infant is born in the hospital wards
on the Seventh Level. Parthenogenesis is the method used to grow type two
beings. The now common transsexual surgery on the surface world, began at
the Dulce Base. Men became women on a whim in the Seventh Level labs, and
with the Fourth Level technology, the brain washing [resulted in] the
"eager desire to become a woman" and that poor man [whether a willing or
unwilling participant] FIRMLY BELIEVES he always wanted to be a woman. No
one could convince him to believe the truth. ALL THINGS ARE TWISTED AT
DULCE. A quote by Dr. Ralph W. Gerard [in THE SECOND GENESIS] put in his
now classic statement: "There can be no twisted thought without a twisted
molecule". MOST have originated at Dulce.



Q -- How are the human workers stopped from telling everything about Dulce?

A -- Implants, fear threats to harm the families, EM control, also
reprogramming with ELF [Extremely Low Frequency] and drugs are the most
common methods to 'encourage' the workers not to divulge the location or
daily routine.



Q -- A construction worker at "The Ant Hill" [The Northrup's Tehachapi
Base] reports seeing 10-12 foot tall human looking beings in lab coats. Who
are these guys, are they from the hollow earth? (Note: The Hollow Earth
theory is one that was postulated by various well known individuals,
including Marshall B. Gardner, Raymond Bernard, William Halley - discoverer
of Halley's comet, Edgar Allen Poe, Edgar Rice Burroughs, John Cleves
Symmes, John Uri Lloyd and others. Basically the thesis involves what one
might refer to as the Geoconcavitic sphere theory, or that as the earth was
forming in its molton state the planetary spin created a hollow or
concavity within the center similar to the hollow created by the
centrifugal force of a horizontal washing machine following a spin cycle.
The theory, which has been postulated in para-geological theories, in
adventure novels, and in some cases even in alleged visits to the "inner
world", states that the 'shell' of the earth averages between 800-1000
miles thick, with an interior surface consisting of oceans and land
illuminated perpetually by a sphere of electromagnetic and/or nuclear
energy suspended at the very center of the "empty space". There are
reputedly funnel-like openings near the polar regions, perpetually
concealed by mist created by the collision of cold air from the outside and
hot air from the inside, which permits ingress and egress to and from this
inner 'world'. The theory states that the inner surface has its own
gravity, yet slightly less than the outer surface gravity. One side-theory
is that between the inner and outer surface where gravity is nullified
there exists a layer of weightless or low-weight caverns in an eternal
state of chaos where minerals, liquids, gases and chemicals continually
slam together from the earth's rotation, causing intense magmatic activity,
a virtual inferno, or "bottomless pit". Some have theorized that -- based
on the Apocryphal book of Esdras, chapter 13, which contains non-cannonized
Jewish legends -- that the 10 'lost' tribes of Israel disappeared beyond
the river Sambatyon and to a place in the far north where humans never
lived before called 'Arzareth'. In the last days, a path would be made
through the ice and waters of the north and the lost tribes would return.
There are three tribes accounted for as of this writing, or rather two
tribes and two half tribes: Judah, Benjamin, half of the Levite tribe, and
apparently half of the tribe of Dan if we are to believe the Ethiopian
'Jews' who claim to be descended from Dan. The '13th' tribe would be
accounted for by the fact that the two Josephite tribes of Ephraim and
Manassah are considered distinctive tribes in and of themselves. As for the
'giants', some believe that these have a direct connection to the 10-12
foot tall 'Anakim' people mentioned in the Old Testament who were driven
out of Palestine, following which the Torah gives no further details as to
their fate, although there have been many reports of such 'giants' being
encountered in large cavern systems below Alaska, Oregon, California, Utah,
Texas and Mexico, and also reports of ancient gravesites in the western
U.S. and elsewhere where the remains of human giants have reportedly been
discovered. Most often they -- like the fifth dimensional "Sasquatch
people" themselves -- have been described as being benevolent, unless
provoked. - Branton)

A. They are probably inner earth drones [workers]. The deeper you get, the
stranger the life forms. The tall men are from the subterranean levels,
lower yet are the dwarfed deformed forms. I don't trust either of them.
There are other forms, that both the tall men and the dwarfed men fear and
loathe, they are similar to Bigfoot in appearance, but extremely violent
and enjoy eating what ever they find while it is still alive! They are
subhuman and demented, with an IQ around 15 (Note: Apparently, according to
another source, these lower 'Bigfoot' type creatures -- having more of a
resemblance to apes than to the more "human-like" faces and features of the
much friendlier Sasquatch people who frequent the surface -- dwell in wild
cavern systems some 6 or more miles deep, along with other very large and
dangerous insectoid and quadruped or serpentine reptilian life forms
reminiscent to something from out of a hadean nightmare. This is according
to a report I investigated some years ago of a group of speleonauts who
reportedly broke into a vast underground labyrinth west and northwest of
Cushman, Arkansas, where they encountered these types of creatures as well
as friendly blue-skinned humans who claimed to be descended from a family
that had survived an ancient global deluge by taking refuge within a large
ship. These ancient people claimed that their ancestors had come to the
Americas and discovered the cavern 'world', wherein they commenced to
establish their hidden civilization. - Branton). The reptiloid [hominoid as
opposed to quadruped or serpentine] life forms stay in caves or caverns
that aren't very deep. They prefer the desert mountains. They use
camouflage rather than fighting, but they do carry vril rods for protection
[flash guns]. They do have a symbol, not the hokey "snake-with-wings" that
I keep seeing in the public (which is used mostly by the GREYS and also as
a medical symbol for the Delta Force - Branton). The REPTOIDS use a dragon
with its tail in its mouth [a circle] with seven pointed stars in the
middle.



Q -- There have been reports of the Delta Force having black vans with no
tires that hover over the ground. How much are we [U.S.A.] already
inter-working with alien cultures?

A -- I haven't seen the black vans you mentioned. We are totally submerged
with alien cultures. Very little of the original human cultures have
survived.



Q -- How can WE [the public] go after, or expose an alien culture which is
covert and hidden?

A -- Go for the best shot. That means go after the REPTOID. They stay near
the surface, they choose to try to hide and avoid contact. They are
soldiers, doing a job and usually there are two or three at each job site.
They are 'manning' a remote post. They are not to bother the humans unless
they are endangering the post. Most of them are not hostile and won't
kidnap you, they may blast you with a flash gun that may paralyze you [you
won't remember the flash] for an hour or two and cause confusion and mild
fear. It could cause you to black out [pass out] for a while. It is their
way to escape and buy time to hide any visible equipment. If you know any
areas with repeated reptilian sightings, then that is the place for you to
look. They are fearsome to meet face to face, and their voices are harsh
and whispery with heavy ss's, but most of them understand English [and
several other languages]. Wear something with a reptile [not something
violent, like St. George killing the Dragon!] in sight. If you see one,
keep your hands OPEN, palm forward, arms DOWN. That is the non-aggression
approach. DON'T raise your arms, unless told to. DON'T carry anything in
your hands or arms. If he doesn't run, walk SLOWLY towards him. Let him
speak first. They consider humans repulsive and hostile and threatening
[with good reason!]. DON'T try to offer him anything, DON'T touch him or
anything of his. If he hisses at you, back up a couple feet, but DON'T LOOK
AWAY! It simply means he finds you smelly. DON'T try to overpower him, he
is stronger than ten or twelve men! Usually, if he hasn't run so far, he is
curious and wants to talk to you. FIGHT YOUR FEAR and your thoughts of
panic.



Q -- How do we get closer to some kind of data to prove to others that
there really is a danger from non-human beings?

A -- Good question. I'm afraid we will find the proof the hard way, when we
are invaded. Try to keep a small camera with you at all times. When you
search for reptoids, keep it in your pocket.



Q -- Is there a specific location where the public can set up their cameras
and equipment to DOCUMENT an alien-government base, and/or their
activities?

A -- The problem is, most of the meetings are held in military bases or
underground. The Groom Lake Facility does fly several alien craft that
regularly fly over unpopulated land that go back and forth from several
bases, Southern California has several notable areas. Twenty Nine Palms --
Lancaster or Chocolate Mountains are well know for such activities.



Q -- Could you provide us with a copy of your badge or card you used at
Dulce?

A -- Badges or cards never leave the bases. All exits have bars or walls of
metal... to open, to go out requires using the card. When you use it for an
exit slot, the card won't come out. Each time you leave the base, you are
issued a new card, with all the usual data about you, plus your weight
added, corrected daily. There are several mines in the Chocolate Mts. that
open into a base highway, but be aware that they are patrolled regularly
and there are cameras there.



Q -- There are so many types of really far out 'Aliens' seen in TV, movies,
magazines and popular fiction, is there one type of a fictional unknown
race, in your opinion, that fits the term 'Alien'?

A -- Yes! There are two, an alien that is totally indescribable, and
another would be a pseudo-alien.

Q -- What are the dimensions of the Dulce Facility?

A -- There are 1,700 paved miles of roads under Dulce and Northern New
Mexico., towards Los Alamos is another 800 miles of tunnels. The base is
STILL GROWING [due west].



Q -- What is the top depth?

A -- The First Level starts 200 feet from the surface. Each level has a
ceiling of seven feet, except levels six and seven, the ceiling there is 45
and 60 feet. There are approximately 45 feet or more between each level.
The average highway ceiling is twenty five feet. The HUB at the base is
3,000 feet wide. Use a 7.5 minute scale map to try to comprehend the size
of the place.



Q -- Are there "regular vehicle" exits that can be observed from the
ground?

A -- Yes, but they are inside Los Alamos.



Q -- Are their aerial exits that can be observed?

A -- Twenty miles due north of Dulce (across the border into southern
Colorado? - Branton) is a large hanger, it is hidden by a facade of cliffs.
Look for an isolated short road on the top of a mesa, with no road to or
from the top.



Q -- Are the ventilation shafts visible?

A -- The ventilation shafts are hidden by bushes or vents inside caves.
There are five on the top of the mesa, be aware there are cameras inside
most of the vents.



Q -- Is there external security, and could we recognize them in or around
the town itself?

A -- There is minimal security on the surface, most of the men [and women]
are Air Force or "highway crew" men. There used to be a Best Western motel
that hosts or hires a lot of Base workers from Level One. I don't know if
that motel is still operational. Most of the security force live in Santa
Fe. Others live at White Pine [Los Alamos].



Q -- Are there security sensors? What type? If so, what is their power
source?

A -- Yes there are many types of sensors, radar, infrared, heat sensors,
microwave, EMGW, and satellite. Most of the sensors are powered by magnetic
power. The only thing you may notice on the surface, would be an occasional
satellite dish.



Q -- If you can, give us some information on the upcoming war with the
aliens. When does it start? Do you recommend going underground?

A -- The war has already begun. To start, they use "weather control"
devices that can cripple a city in hours. Storms, flood and drought -- with
those few things they can bring any country to their knees in a hurry. Yes,
I do recommend going underground. Choose a location that has a higher
elevation than the surrounding terrain. Pick out a cave or even an
abandoned mining shaft or two, bury a cache of supplies [including food and
water!] near these locations. Place the supplies in heavy plastic boxes
that have tight lids [to prevent the destruction by earth burrowing rodents
and insects]. Then plan to live like a squatter when it becomes necessary.
If you own land, create a system of tunnels and tell no one. Use your
tunnels to secrete your supplies, and plan to live in those corridors when
you must.



Q -- What about the reptilian ships that are in orbit around the equator
(presumably including the original two 'planetoids' that arrived in
geosynchronous orbits around earth at 400 and 600 miles up in 1953. This
reportedly led to an NSA project which successfully communicated with the
Grey aliens and resulted in a contact-landing-treaty scenario involving
president Eisenhower and other Executive-Military-Industrial officials at
Muroc/Edwards/Holloman Air Force Bases in 1954 - Branton), are they
cloaked?

A -- They are not cloaked the way you may think. It's more like nobody is
learning to SEE, even though it is in plain sight. Like the mail man
becomes invisible because you are so used to seeing him you never noticed
he is alive. One of the favorite methods of covert activities is to 'hide'
their operation in such an OBVIOUS way [or place] that no one would suspect
it is covert (for instance, hiding entrances to underground bases beneath
religious shrines, federal buildings, mining works, malls, libraries,
lodges, hotels or basically areas that one would consider the least likely
places to hide or accommodate an entrance to an underground facility. The
underground New World Order 'FEMA' facilities throughout the United States
apparently utilize this type of concealment with many of their bases. -
Branton)!



Q -- What are the Greys susceptible to?

A -- The grays are photosensitive, any bright light hurts their eyes. They
avoid sunlight, and travel at night. Camera flashes causes them to back up.
It could be used as a weapon against them, but they recover quickly. It
could buy enough time to escape. Use commands, or nonsensical words in the
form of commands and they will back up. Their brain is more logical than
ours and they do not create 'fun'. They do not understand poetry either.
What really confuses them is saying things in "pig-latin". We learned that
in a hurry, and used it against them [the GREYS] in the Dulce Wars.



Q -- Can greys read your intentions if you came up behind one?

A -- Yes. They read your INTENT, because they use your body's frequency.
The human race broadcasts a frequency, that they recognize as an
electromagnetic impulse. Each person has a slightly different frequency,
that difference is what we call 'personality'. When a human thinks, they
broadcast strong impulses, in the case of 'fear' the frequency is 'loud'
and easy to recognize (by the same right, a calm and composed mind-set
should be far more difficult to 'recognize' - Branton).



Q -- Can we shield ourselves against their mental control?

A -- We CAN shield ourselves against them, however 95% of the human race
never try to control their thoughts, and controlling our own thoughts is
the best weapon. The average person rarely thinks in a clear pattern. That
allows the brain to think in a chaotic way. Control your thoughts, AND YOU
CAN STOP THE ALIENS ATTEMPTING TO ABDUCT AND CONTROL YOU. Controlling my
own thoughts have kept me alive for years.



Q -- Could you shed some light on the type of human the aliens are looking
for when they abduct?

A -- I can tell you that the most common are petite women in their early
twenties or early thirties, dark haired boys between five to nine, small to
medium size men in their mid-twenties to mid-forties. But, let me stress
that there are ALL TYPES of people being held against their will in the
Dulce Base! There are tall heavy men and women, teenagers, elderly folks
and very young girls in the cages AND the vats. I only mention the most
common age-size are the small young men and petite women. The boys are
favored because at that age their bodies are rapidly growing, and their
atomic material is adaptable in the transfer chamber. The young small women
are frequently very fertile. The men are used for sperm. I have no idea why
they prefer small to average size men.



Q -- Did you ever see twins or triplets, etc.?

A -- Since you mentioned it, no. It never crossed my mind to search for
them. But then that doesn't mean they aren't there. There is no way I could
have seen everybody at that huge complex.



Q -- What is the prevalent human race at the Dulce Base? I am curious about
both the human workers, and the inmates.

A -- The human work force is made of people from every nation on the
surface world. The one thing they share is that they all speak english. If
you are asking if there are white, black, red, yellow and brown skin color,
again I'll have to say that there is no 'prevalent' race there. As for
inmates, I could see ALL races there. From what I could see, it looked like
there were more 'white' people, but again, I saw a constant flow of
different people, many I think, were only there for a few hours.



Q -- Please explain the method they use to identify each inmate.

A -- No one has a name. When first brought to this facility, they were
issued one large 'number'. Usually that code has a mixture of numbers and
letters. They show the place, how, and by who, followed by the time, age,
sex and finally the personal number [their S.S. number]. For example it
might look like this: NVLV-00A-00700-P00:00:00-00-M-000-00-000



Q -- With that huge facility, trash and garbage must be a real problem, how
do they dispose it?

A -- It was never a problem. Some of it is 'reformed' or melted down then
remade. Some of the wet garbage is 'eaten' by bacterial forms, and what's
left is vaporized in a vat like chamber. The residue of that action [it
takes them months to get enough to measure] is used in a complex lye and
used to fertilize crops.



Q -- Where is your family? Not just your wife and son, but parents and
siblings?

A -- Cathy and Eric are still missing. My parents died in a car crash when
I was in my teens. I have one brother, if he is alive I suspect he is
inside an underground base some where. I haven't heard from him for several
years. Please pray for them, please!



Q -- What is your birth date, and where were you born?

A -- 23 April 1941, Glen Ellyn, IL [actually in a farm at home, in the
place now called Glen Ellyn, my birth certificate list is at Wheaton, IL]



Q -- You have been through so much, and yet keep fighting, what is your
biggest fear?

A -- That the general public will forget THE TRAPPED INNOCENT PEOPLE in the
despicable place, and will ignore THE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN, WOMEN AND MEN
ADDED TO THAT PLACE EVERY MONTH.
