       Whitley Strieber     | Glad to be here. Hope I manage to stay 
                            | connected 
                            | this time.
       Ann Fischer/SYSOP    | Welcome to the UFO Forum's Conference 
                            | featuring

                            | FORMAL 
                            | open discussion.  Please type a "?" to ask a 
                            | question 
                            | and a "!" to make a comment.  You will be

                            | to let us

       claudine             | ?
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Yes, we will all be keeping our fingers 
                            | crossed for 
                            | you!  Would you like to say anything before 
                            | we start 
                            | taking questions?
       A51Decoy             | ?
       Tanya                | ?
       Whitley Strieber     | Just that there seems to be an exceptional 
                            | amount of 
                            | UFO activity, especially since July. 
                            | Incredible video 
                            | from all over the place, and lots of 
                            | encounter reports. 
                            | ga
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Yes, I have noticed that.  Pretty exciting. 
                            | A51, ga
       A51Decoy             | are you still in contact, and is your family? 
       Whitley Strieber     | Last week a friend who is totally unconnected 
                            | with the 
                            | experience
                            | had a face-to-face encounter in broad 
                            | daylight and
                            | was left pretty astonished. Afterward, I had 
                            | what 
                            | seemed
                            | tobe telepathic contact for about twenty-four 
                            | hours.
                            | It seemed related to the chain of mountains 
                            | that
                            | stretches from Canada to South America, and 
                            | was 
                            | very eerie. At one point, I heard the phrase, 
                            | "a
                            | shadow hangs over the cordilliera" and saw an 
                            | image of these mountains. Of course, the 
                            | greatest
                            | amount of UFO activity by far in the past few 
                            | years, 
                            | has occurred from Colorado to Argentina, 
                            | along the 
                            | whole massif. ga
       A51Decoy             | I mean, can you contact them? do you think 
                            | you are 
                            | messing with something that is beyond your 
                            | reach?
                            | ga
       Whitley Strieber     | Contact them? I don't really try at the 
                            | present time. I've 
                            | done that and it worked pretty well, as I 
                            | chronicled in 
                            | Breakthrough. But I want to go beyond simply 
                            | contacting
                            | them. I want to be actively involved in the 
                            | search. ga
       Wily Coyote          | ?
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Claudine, you're turn.
       claudine             | hello mr Stieber, I am not in the USA but 
                            | trying to get all your 
                            | books, are you preparing a new one? are they 
                            | still visiting you?
       Ender                | ?
       Whitley Strieber     | You won't get Breakthrough extra-US. For some 
                            | reason, I could not get the agent to sell it 
                            | abroad even 
                            | though there is a big market. I am still 
                            | involved with 
                            | them, but I wouldn't say that it involves 
                            | "visits." I want 
                            | to make some kind of new relationship. I 
                            | don't know 
                            | just what I want from the right now. The most 
                            | powerful thing i can get, I suppose.
                            | ga
       Lillian              | ?
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Wily Coyote, you are next.
       Wily Coyote          | What does telepathy feel like? Do you sense 
                            | words in your mind or do you feel 
                            | non-verbal energies that you interpret after 
                            | sensing them - or something else?

       Ronald E. Cooksey    | ?
       zermatt              | zermatt ?
       Whitley Strieber     | Feels like a lot of things, ranging from very 
                            | exact 
                            | phrases, spoken as if by a living voice, to 
                            | pictures, to 
                            | ideas. Trouble is, IS IT REAL? I am never 
                            | sure, of 
                            | course, which is both the problem with it and 
                            | the
                            | thing that makes it so provocative and 
                            | interesting.ga
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Tanya, your turn
       A51Decoy             | ?
       Tanya                | First, thanks for talking to us. Do you 
                            | believe the 
                            | visitors are on a specific timetable to 
                            | ultimately 
                            | reveal themselves to mankind in general? Have 
                            | they revealed any further info on where 
                            | mankind is 
                            | headed in the near term? ga
       Madelynne            | ?
       Whitley Strieber     | Timetable, yes. But part of how it unfolds 
                            | seems to 
                            | have to do with us. Part of it is very 
                            | mechanical. For 
                            | example, the first gigantic public sighting 
                            | that took
       Susan S. Surrett     | !
       Whitley Strieber     | place in Mexico occurred on the day one of 
                            | the native
                            | calendars changed to a new sun. ga
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Ender, you are next.
       Ender                | A little off the suject, (sorry,
                            | but I'm curious) I recently
                            | saw the Communion movie,
                            | what was your impressions
                            | of it? 
       Whitley Strieber     | Complex question! Simple answer: it was 
                            | emotionally authentic, but the effects did 
                            | not work as 
                            | well 
                            | as we had hoped, and the director, in his 
                            | effort to 
                            | communicate the ambiguity of the experience 
                            | and 
                            | some of its
                            |  hyperdimensional flavor, took lots of 
                            | liberties with
                            | the structure of my encounters as I remember 
                            | them.
       DianneG              | ?
       Whitley Strieber     | Overall, I am finding that I like the film 
                            | better as time 
                            | goes by, to coin a phrase. The director's 
                            | ideas
       Tanya                | ?
       Whitley Strieber     | are surprisingly rich, I think. It;s a film 
                            | that will last, I 
                            | feel, and I am surprised at that--pleasantly. 
                            | ga
       Lillian              | In your interviews with abductees has anyone 
                            | ever related an experience of seeing  large 
                            | almond shaped emerald green eyes? Thank 
                            | you  GA
       Whitley Strieber     | Red, white, black, brown. Don't recall green 
                            | or 
                            | emerald, but it could be in the database 
                            | somewhere.ga
       Melanie Green/ SL6   | Claudine, you are next :)
       claudine             | I am convinced (from my experience) that we 
                            | are using a small 
                            | part of our mind potential to undersand this 
                            | "phenomena", then 
                            | there are other different perceptions like 
                            | emotions, which are 
                            | then captured by the brain, and not least, 
                            | are our higher 
                            | perceptions that belong to the realm of 
                            | intuition.  We have to work 
                            | hard on ourselves to develop as human beings, 
                            | so we can really 
                            | start to communicate and understand them, you 
                            | all know it is 
                            | difficult enough to do this with our own 
                            | human brothers and 
       Whitley Strieber     | We have a life that is entirely outside of 
                            | time, that we 
                            | intentionally do not remember while we are 
                            | enacting 
                            | our lives.
                            | But we are going to remember--the fact that 
                            | we can 
                            | even see the visitors means that we are 
                            | starting to do 
                            | that. Mankind is entering the cosmos, 
                            | beginning to 
                            | raise
                            | its consciousness to this new level. Exciting 
                            | time to 
                            | be alive. ga

       Ronald E. Cooksey    | Hi Whitley, I have had strange happenings for 
                            | 12 
                            | yrs. but no conscious memory of visitors. how 
                            | can i 
                            | get them to show themselves to me?ga

       Whitley Strieber     | Be careful with this or your imagination will 
                            | do the 
                            | showing for you! I would try to create as 
                            | much peace 
                            | in my life as possible, to meditate, and give 
                            | myself 
                            | permission to remember. This will help some, 
                            | if you 
                            | are patient. It's a tough one, but if you

       Whitley Strieber     | The next thing in this experience has to do 
                            | with 
                            | learning to go outside of time and see our 
                            | true past 
                            | and probable future. We can learn to use 
                            | prophecy as 
                            | a tool. Fortunately, in this case, science is 
                            | keeping up
                            | with us, because, as Hawking said in October,

                            | And I agree with you about images. It works,

                            | call of sorts, with the theme "woe to she who 
                            | knows and does nothing!"  It was really 
                            | upsetting 
                            | and we all felt terribly guilty for not

       Whitley Strieber     | That quote rings a bell. Bible, maybe? I'm 
                            | always 
                            | getting the feeling--or actually being 
                            | told--that I am 
                            | screwing up. My question back is, on whose 
                            | terms? If 
                            | I screw up because I don't get the message, 
                            | then I 
                            | think that the messenger has to take partial

       Whitley Strieber     | Since the friend I referred to at the top of 
                            | the CO had 
                            | his encounter on a city street, I would 
                            | assume that 
                            | they are indeed living among us. Breakthrough

       Paul S. Cilwa        | Regarding your friends who initiated contact 
                            | and 
                            | then wanted it to stop: If you are ABSOLUTELY 
                            | UNAMBIGUOUS that you want the visits to 
                            | cease--sub-consciously as well as 
                            | consciously--they 
                            | will. Controlling the subconscious is tricky 
                            | but can be 
                            | done with visualization, self-hypnosis, 
                            | chanting, etc. I

       Whitley Strieber     | They are not a mental effect isolated within 
                            | the 
                            | individual. There are too many multiple

                            | experiences for that to be true. I think that 
                            | they are a 
                            | whole lot of things, or so complex that they 
                            | might as
                            | well be a group of related phenomena, as far 
                            | as we 
                            | are concerned. Are they aliens from another

                            | On some level, probably. But I think, mostly, 
                            | that 
                            | we cannot yet articulate what they are. we

       DianneG              | Whitley, there is a book by Courtney 
                            | Brown...whereby 
                            | he makes claims of remote viewing an alien 
                            | race 
                            | currently living in SA. What are your

       Whitley Strieber     | SA? What is SA?ga
       DianneG              | South America!! GA
       Whitley Strieber     | Oh, yes. Major Dames and his people believe, 
                            | as I 
                            | understand it, that there are Martians living 
                            | in South 
                            | America. 
                            | Mars certainly plays some role in all this, 
                            | but 
                            | we have a lot to learn about remote viewing 
                            | before we 
                            | can rely on it absolutely as a source of 
                            | fact. 
                            | Courtney's
                            | book is an experiment, and a brave one.  But 
                            | it is only 
                            | the beginning. Lots of adventure in that 
                            | direction, I 
                            | would think. He has a school in Atlanta, by

       Whitley Strieber     | I don't know the answers to these questions. 
                            | In a 
                            | way, it isn't time. I think that mankind is 
                            | still in the 
                            | process of deciding if we want this at all. 
                            | Once we 
                            | have turned toward it within ourselves as a

                            | and a part of our world, we will find that the

       Whitley Strieber     | secrecy, official and otherwise, disappears, 
                            | and we

       ECL Robin            | I had a dream in which I had some loving

                            | Their craft (very large) came over my head

                            | that?  Are the Martians living in South

                            | people described in Courtney's book are more

                            | What do 
                            | you think is the Biblical significant of 
                            | these abductions 
                            | from your personal experiences?  Seems that 
                            | many 
                            | become more spiritual after becoming aware of 
                            | visitors.  But I also recall that many 
                            | primitive tribes also 
                            | thought that more advanced civilizations were

       Whitley Strieber     | Threw the table in 1989, my friend. What

                            | to do it was the fact that something ran at

                            | across the room, and it did not look like

       Whitley Strieber     | It is written and I am struggling to find a

                            | Even though my sales are great, there is lots

                            | adventure. But we have a lot of deciding to 
                            | do. We 
                            | don't need to worry, though. We WILL decide. 
                            | The 
                            | important thing for those of us deep
                            | in the experience, is to make as much noise 
                            | as we 
                            | can so that

                            | flavor of the 
                            | thing--and not one corrupted by the Satanic 
                            | influnces
