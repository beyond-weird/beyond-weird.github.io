Due to lack of free time, I am no longer up keeping the faq, it has grown
vary large and requires more time than I have to up keep it. If you are  
intrested in maintaining this faq, write me. To those who want to have

won't be adding it. Please accept my appologies about this. 
I still may post the faq every so often when I have the time to do so;
however it won't have any new information it it. I don't have much time

if you post a request for the faq there, I may miss reading it. 

Hello and welcome to the alt.alien.visitors Frequently Asked Questions
posting. You may notice that this FAQ does not follow the standard question
asked, question answered format. The reason for this is that this FAQ is
designed to answer questions of people who are new to this Usenet discussion
group, and designed to be a useful reference source to those interested in
UFOlogy. I tried to keep a neutral stance when I researched the many of the
subjects covered in this FAQ; however you may also notice that some of the
material seem to be one-sided. When doing some of the research I may have
only used one book or source, thus (as you may have noticed) some authors
present information from only one point of view and this has a tendency to
be carried over to this FAQ, do to the lack of information on the subject
from another point of view.  (deep huh?) 

Also please when reading information from this FAQ (as one poster put it)
take everything you read here with a very large grain of salt. (rock salt)
Even I don't believe all the information that I have included in this FAQ.
As I said its mainly a reference to help you out. If you find yourself
interested in a UFO related subject, **DO RESEARCH** read books on the
subject, dig into both sides, write letters to the authors and researchers. 

I would once again like to thank everyone who contributed to the FAQ, 
I would like to especially thank Steve Gamble and Jeff Papineau for the work  
they put into the UFO Organizations section.

=== 0.0: Whats New to the FAQ?
------------------------------
New informarion since last psoting:
None - some information may be out of date.

Due to lack of free time, I am no longer up keeping the faq, it has grown
vary large and requires more time than I have to up keep it. If you are  
intrested in maintaining this faq, write me. To those who want to have
information added or updated in the FAQ, please don't send it to me. I 
won't be adding it. Please accept my appologies about this. 
I still may post the faq every so often when I have the time to do so;
however it won't have any new information it it. I don't have much time
to read a.a.v. these days, I do manage to get on every one in a while, so
if you post a request for the faq there, I may miss reading it. 

=== 0.1: About alt.alien.visitors
---------------------------------
alt.alien.visitor is a Usenet discussion group available through internet.
Currently a.a.v. is the only UFO related discussion group available on
Usenet. It caters to a wide rage of UFO related discussion from New Age
UFOlogy to Scientific UFOlogy. It currently receives around 36 posting
daily. All comments by me are indicated by the square brackets[]

=== 0.2: Posting to alt.alien.visitors
--------------------------------------
The following idea was suggested by matthews_k@cubldr.colorado.edu and is
taken from mwauford@UTKUX1.UTK.EDU (Melissa Wauford)'s "*** REC.ARTS.TV
POSTING GUIDELINES ***". I have adapted it to fit alt.alien.visitors, and
I feel that this is an excellent idea. I would recommend that you use this
system when posting to alt.alien.visitors.

alt.alien.visitors can be a controversial newsgroup with a wide variety
of discussed topics. A few topics may generate more traffic than others
and may contain subject matter related to UFOlogy that others wish to
filter out or concentrate upon.  In order to allow those who use rn or
some other method of pre-selecting articles to filter out (or save away)
postings about these heavy traffic subjects, an abbreviation scheme has
been created.  Please help out by starting your subject line with one of
the following abbreviations when posting about these topics. For example:

~Subject: HOT - Dancing Aliens

or

~Subject: OP: Grey finger snacks,(the trick is in how you fold them)

New abbreviations will be added as needed. Send suggestions directly to
me, and I'll add them to the list. Objections to any abbreviations should
probably be posted so that a consensus may be reached. Old abbreviations
will be deleted when no longer necessary.


Suggested Abbreviations by matthews_k@cubldr.colorado.edu:
[revised by Fsdlk@acad3.alaska.edu]

 ABD = Abduction information
  CE = Pertaining to UFO sightings and phenomena, Close Encounters,
       alien contact
  HA = Jokes & silliness
 HOT = Someone flaming someone else
 INV = Postings about alien invasions and conspiracies 
MISC = Other categories like Atlantis/Mu/Spacemen, etc...
  NA = New Age stuff 
NEWS = UFO related news, upcoming conventions.
  OP = Opinions
 REP = Repostings of older post like Lear, Cooper, etc..
 SCI = Scientific (preferably not pseudo) findings on UFO related issues


=== 0.3: People who post to alt.alien.visitors
----------------------------------------------
Readers and writers of a.a.v. are made up of:

A) People that have had contact.(Rarely post... obvious reasons) 
B) Government paid disinformation people. (Poor to fair fiction) 
C) Questioning/Inquiring minds (post questions, do research, answer
   questions) 
D) Wanderers (Just passing through, make snide remarks if any) 
E) A few who think aliens are out there but haven't/won't come here. 
F) A few who think aliens are with us know but have had no contact. 
G) Aliens (Grey, life sucking, invader of utopia) 
H) Guys like me that just can't unsubscribe from this group. (It's just to
   much fun. Life looks darker and things aren't very clear. (guess this
   belongs in alt.consp....) But when all else falls through pull up a.a.v.
   and smile. Someone is always a little worse off than you are and here is
   one sure fired place to find one.
I) People who are not contactees, or new-agers, or sceptics, but are simply
   interested in high-strangeness phenomenon of all sorts (and generally try
   not to post snide comments or be simple minded!)
J) Humans from parallel dimensions who are trapped in ours. (Luckily, they
   come from one w/higher tech and brought their own spacefleet. Either
   that, or they have used our tech to build some things to fight the Grays
   with, say..Orion-class pulse engines (nuclear explosions for propulsion.))

== 0.4: Common Sense Guidelines
-------------------------------
When posting to any Usenet group please follow these general guidelines.

(1)  Do not post on subjects that clearly unrelated to the newsgroup.
     Take them to the appropriate news group for discussion.

     Example: Discussion of abortion, gun control, politics and other
     strictly non related UFO should not be posted on this news group.

(2)  Do not completely repost others peoples postings and then write your
     opinion about it. Selectively edit the the post to get the information
     you need from it to make your point. The standard symbol used to show
     information from another post is the ">".

     Example of what not to do: Repost a long section of material quoted
     from a previous article, followed by "I agree" or words to that
     effect.

2:03: Marfa Lights
------------------
Marfa lights  are balls of lights that appear, change different colors
and dance around in the air.  These lights where named after the town
that they have been appearing in, Marfa Texas. They have also been sited
in other areas. Some theories as to what they are include Ball lighting,
Car headlights, and Alien space ships. The last current sighting I'm
aware of was Marfa Texas on September 1 1992.

Main Source: Sightings, FOX Network airdate September 25, 1992

2:04: Men In Black (MIB)
------------------------
These are a group of individuals who are said to wear black suits and
drive and fly around in unmarked black cars and helicopters.  They go
about  threatening people who have claimed to have seen UFOs into not
talking about what they witnessed.

The very first occurrence of MIB was traced to a man named Albert K.
Bender.  He was the editor of a flying saucer publication called the
"Space Review" In the October 1953 issue he placed an announcement
stating that he had come across information that would solve the flying
saucer mystery but they could not print it because they were ordered not
to.  They then ended the announcement warning others in saucer work to be
"very cautious"  they then stopped their publications. Later in an
interview Bender stated that "three men wearing dark suits" had ordered
him to stop publishing flying saucer material, and  that he had complied
with the order because he had been "scared to death" of them. He later
published a book called "Flying Saucers and the Three Men in Black"

2:05: Tectonic Strain Theory (TST)
----------------------------------
A theory of electromagnetic effects upon the human brain and/or the
physical environment, such that all Forteana including UFOs, ghosts, ESP,
sasquatch, and religious fervour can be explained as being caused by
seismic activity generating electromagnetic radiation which in turn makes
people think they are witnesses to an anomalous event. Alternatively, the
EMM radiation can luminesce so that it appears as a UFO.  Chief
proponent: Michael Persinger. A variant is the "Earth Lights" hypothesis
described by Paul Devereux.

-------------- 
A term used by the UFO community in reference to the alien abductors or
extraterrestrials.

=== Alien Races 
---------------------
These are often talked about in books, Publcations and on this discussion
group.

3.00: Andromedans
---------------
These are a non-physical race of purely awesome ancient angelic beings from
the Andromeda galaxy. They ultimately are the spiritual force behind the
Ashtar command and are the leaders behind the Pleiadians and our whole
human branch of evolution! Not only that, but they are the guiding power
behind at least one other completely different branch of evolution: The
Cygnusian races - quiet, slimy, amphibian like creatures who come from
planets in the constellation Cygnus. Again, the way the Andromeda galaxy
beings are helping the beings in our own Milky Way galaxy grow, is a
macrocosmic example of how the Pleiadians civilization is helping our Earth
civilization grow.

3.01: Arcturus
--------------
Members of Confederations of Humans   
The Arcturians are a very spiritual race that lives in a universe or
reality of pure love. There seems to be a gateway of some sorts at
this planet which transmits higher energies to our dimensional
universe.

3.02: Aryans (Blondes)
----------------------
Blond Nordic Humanoids who work with the greys. Said to be captured by
the Reptoids and also have implants. They are said to have a tendency to
switch their loyalties between the Reptoids and the Confederations of
Humans.

3.03: Bllues (Star Warriors)
----------------------------
The Blues are said to have translucent skin, large almond shaped eyes and
small of stature. The main issue of their teaching was PURSUE YOUR
PASSION, follow your own way, do your own thing, don't be pressured into
being anything but what and who you are.

The information about the Blues comes from Robert Morningsky a
Hopi/Apache dancer. According to Morningsky the first alien contact
started about 1947 - 1948 with the Greys contacting the U.S. Government
to form a treaty with them. Another body of Aliens arrived, called the
Blues. The Blues advised the government not to deal with the greys saying
it would only lead to disaster. They told the U.S. to follow your own
path. They said they would would teach with peace and harmony if men
would disarm and listen. The military said no deal. So they left, but a
few decided to remain and stayed in Northern Mexico and Arizona and made
a treaty with the Hopi Indians. These Aliens are known by the Hopi as
Star Warriors. The greys started monitoring the Blues. So the Blues had
to flee the reservation and go into hiding, a few of the Elders went with
them.

The Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather
who came from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from
under the earth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out
of the earth, these evil under-grounders were also called two hearts.

3.04: Centaurian
--------------
These are blond nordic types who come from Alpha Centauri. They like the
Pleiadians seek to help us grow spiritually, but they don't take as active
a role as the other races, although they do and have made contacts with
select people on Earth.

3.05: Confederation of Humans (Intergalactic Confederation)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is more often referred to as the "Intergalactic Confederation",
headed by the Ashtar Command. It consists of an organization of alien
groups born out of positive energy, that are helping the human race along
and desire to protect them.  Includes: Vega, Arcturus, Sirius, Pleiades,
Lyrians, DALs and Centaurians.

3.06: DALs
--------
This is a race of nordic types who come from what is called the
DAL Universe. They are a branch of the Lyrians and are very advanced
technically and spiritually; about 300-1000 years ahead of the
Pleiadians. They are helping the Pleiadians in a very similar manner
to which the Pleiadians are helping us.

3.07: Greys
-----------
This is the most commonly identified alien race in UFOlogy. Their are
many different views, stories and theories regarding them ranging from
the different New Age views to the different Scientific, and conspiracy
views.

Greys as presented by the Scientific Community:
 The Greys are the most commonly described race by abduction victims. In
this view they are considered a race with an unknown motives, and
agendas. They seem to be abducting, studying, testing and using various
individuals for their one unclear reasons. [See: Abductions and Current
Theories]

Greys as presented by the New Age Movement:
  In the new age movement the Greys are often associated as an evil race,
or a race with bad energy. They are often associated with many other
races, such as the Reptoids and their motives are known.

Greys as presented by Different Conspiracy Theories
  The different conspiracy theories are often a mix of the scientific and
new age views. The standard conspiracy base states that the Greys crashed
one or more of their space ships and they were found by the U.S.
Government. The Government them makes a secret treaty with the Greys
allowing them to abduct humans in exchange for their technology. The
conspiracy theories often end with the Greys not keeping their part of
the deal. [I will try and include some of the different conspiracy
theories when I have more time to research them in detail]

Their are descriptions of several types of Greys: they are all humanoid in
appearance, a head, main body, two arms, hands, legs, and feet.

1: The most commonly seen grey is around two to four feet tall, very
slender and delicate looking, small beings and light weight, extremely
penetrating black slanted eyes with no pupils, almost vestigial mouth
and nose, a very large head with a pointed chin. The skin color varies
from dark grey to light grey, tan to tanish grey, white to pale white.
They have no hair on their bodies.

2: Another commonly seen Grey is described similarly as above, except
their usually six inches taller, and seem to give the orders. A variation
of this same described individual is: same as above except eyes like big
black buttons and are rounded.

3: Another type of Grey are the small robot like beings, stocky and
little, with smooth rounded hat on top, with dark deep set holes for eyes
and a round O shaped mouth, square breastplate with concentric circles on
it, smell like burnt match heads, mushroom grey skin. These Greys are
often said to act like security guards.

Other variations are described as Reptilian like with claws an preying
mantis like. There have also been many report of cross breeds that are
not exactly human and not exactly Greys.

3.08: Lyrians
-----------
This is the very ancient parent race from which our entire
branch of human or humanoid races emerged, including all the nordic
types, the Orions, and even the Greys. Quite warlike in the infancy of
their civilization, they gradually improved their ways and are now
technically and spiritually at about the level of the Pleiadians.

3.09: Orion Empire (Orion forces)
---------------------------------
The "Orions" are made up of two opposed races. The "Council of Light" was
one based at the star system Betelgeuse, and the equally powerful evil
Orions were based at the star system Rigel. The Orions took over lots of 
planets back in our galaxy's less spiritual days but were always balanced
by the Intergalactic Confederation.

The conquering part of Orion empire was defeated 200,000 years ago
by the Intergalactic Confederation, and they haven't been a threat to
Earth since. They are presently getting ready to "transform into the
4th dimension" just as we of Earth are. In fact, some people on Earth
are reincarnated Orions who are here to integrate their negativity and
hence allow both our worlds to ascend.

3.10: Pleiadians
---------------- 
The Pleiadians are a collective of extraterrestrials from the star system
Pleiades. They are also from various times in our future, starting from
500 years from now to millions of years from now. The Pleiadian culture
is ancient and was "seeded" from another universe of love long before
Earth was created. They have formed a tremendous society which operates
with love, with ideas and ideals that we are yet unfamiliar with.

The Pleiadians started a project to contact and inspire earth humans to
take back their power and create a better reality for themselves. They
are here as ambassadors from another universe to help Earth through her
transition from the third dimension to the fourth dimension and to assist
each of us in our personal endeavors of awakening, remembering and
knowing. As this project has become more successful, more ETs have
joined the group, some from other systems. The group later changed its
name from Pleiadians to the Pleiadians Plus.

The Pleiadians say that their reasons for contacting us is that there is
a chance of tyranny in the future and they are coming back to inspire us
as much as possible so we will take charge of creating our own reality
and change the future.
   They teach a very empowering form of personal and social metaphysics,
with love and clarity. The Pleiadians speak as a collective and there are
no individuals identified. They do not appear in physical form although
they say they can. They say it is safer to come through the channel,  and
it does not attract as much attention.


Billie Meier's Contact from the Pleiades 
Billie Meier was contacted over 130 times between 1976 and 1982 by a
female named Samjese who said she was from the star system Pleiades. She
was the first to telepathically contact Meier and tell him where to go
for the first physical contact. Meier had indepth conversations with
Samjese. The contact notes are published in following four books and are
out of print:

3.11: Sirius
-------------
Members of Confederations of Humans  
They are a watery, dreamy race who are basically an evolved version of
dolphins and whales, somewhat. They are said to live in the Christ
consciousness, and are in a solar system very linked with our own in a
psychic manner. They too play a role in helping Earth, but they are doing
it from a more subtle standpoint, like through the cetaceans in our seas.

3.12: Reptoids
---------------
A reptilian race from Draco bent on conquest,  They are said to be
controling the greys by means of an implant, the same one that the gray
are implanting into humans.  They are also said to be the master minds
behind the abduction plans. Their master plan involves using the newly
created 'Half-breeds' with implants to defeat the Confederations of
Humans. The Reptoids also use humans as food.  [Does this remind you of
the movie V?]

=== Abductions and Current Theories
-----------------------------------
4.00: About Abductions
----------------------
There are many people who believe they have been abducted by UFOnauts.
These abduction victims often experience memory loss and "missing time".
some of them have been able to recall their abductions from memory and
others have recalled their abductions by the aid of hypnosis. Often these
encounters involve being taken aboard an alien craft and examined by the
UFOnauts and put through a variety of physical and mental procedures.
Then the individuals are returned. Many of the abduction victims has
shown signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Some of the major researchers who have studied the abduction field
include Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John Mach, Philip Klass, and Jenny
Randles.

There are several groups with distinct opinions. The dyed-in-the-wool
Skeptics, who who don't believe it. Others who are passing no verdict, but
are still examining  the evidence. Those who believe due to the
similarities of the abduction testimonies. Those who claim to have
information through means such as channeling. Those who claim to have had
first-person experiences, with automatic conscious recall. Those who
claim to have had first-person experiences, with recall under hypnotic
regression.

The opinions of some skeptics such as Klass believe that the hypnotists
themselves are leading the abduction victims unknowingly into believing
that they have had an abduction experience. The skeptics believe that the
the media has been saturated so much with the abduction material that when
people having nightmares or people who believe that they have experienced
the "missing time" are put under hypnosis, they draw upon what they have
seen in the media to fulfill the expectations of the hypnotist and
causes themselves to be put trough the trauma for that reason. They say
the nightmares are often caused by the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, and
the "missing time" is not an uncommon experience and is caused when the
mind is preoccupied by other matters. They often give the advice to go to
clinical doctors, and not to contact an abductionist.

Other researchers such as Jacobs and Hopkins believe that there is
something physical causing the abduction experiences. Hobkins has stated
that he believes that the abduction are real and that the recounts of the
abductions are to similar to each other to be anything but the truth.
Jacobs takes a slightly different approach, he has been categorizing all
the accounts and trying to find patterns in the testimonies. Through this
method he come up with new more indepth theories regarding the
abductions. 

The Channelers believe that the abductions are part of a battle between
good energy forces and evil energy forces. [See Reptoids, Greys and
Pleiadians]

There people on the net who believe they have had personal experiences
with Alien contacts or abductions. Some have posted accounts of their
experiences. Many others decline to post due to attacks by skeptics.

There has been possible material evidence of UFOs or Alien contacts. There
are abundant material traces, even excepting those confiscated by the
military. Material traces include burned grass and earth where UFOs have
landed, UFOs shown on radar tapes, UFOs on film and in photos. Bodily
traces on abductees include scoop-marks in the flesh, incisions, burns,
apparent radiation exposure, bruises, inflammation, etc. Whether any of
these is considered *evidential*, however, is a subjective value call.

=== UFO Projects & Theories & Controversies
--------------------------------------------

6.00: Aurora Project or "deep black" projects
----------------------------------------------
The "Black Projects" are governmental projects that are considered
technological secrets. These can range from laser and particle beams to
top secret aircraft. The "Aurora Project" is the name given to one of
these types of projects by the industry experts involving two new types
of reported aircraft. These aircraft where observed in the south west US
and are said to have been developed at highly classified government
facilities in the Nevada desert. There are two types of advanced aircraft
reported.

One is nick named the "Pulser" aircraft. There have been many sights of
this aircraft by several different  witnesses. When sighted it has
repetitively been described as "A high-speed aircraft characterized by a
very loud, deep, rumbling engine noise (1-2 Hz pulse rate) reminiscent of
heavy-lift rockets."  The smoke trail of the aircraft is described as
being segmented and in a linked sausage shape. (Or another good example
would be to look at one side of your coat zipper, un-zipped, with the
teeth facing you) It is also described as a high-altitude aircraft that
crossed the sky at extremely high speeds. Both ground based and airborne
observers have reported it to be seen flying at altitudes above 50,000
ft. observers have reported see the aircraft as a single bright light
that seldom changed direction, however speed changes where observed. One
observer estimated that it covered 350 miles in 6 minutes. (3500
miles/hr)


This this aircraft may indeed exist. There has been research in to what
are called Pulsed Detonation Engines (PED's) also refereed to as Pulsed
Detonation Wave Engines. These are different type of engine than the
pulse jet engines, which is already publicly know, and has been tested in
aircraft. The PED's are said to be in laboratory and computer analysis
level of development (reported oct of 91) The PED's exhaust emission
produces smoke trails that closely match the pulser aircraft. Simulations
of theses engines are said to be able to propel large aircraft in the
"Mach 0.2-3.0 flight regime"

How PED's work: PED's use shock waves created in a detonation to compress
the fuel-oxidizer mixture prior to combustion. A cylinder chamber
designed to support the detonation is constructed with a flat forward end
which makes up the thrust wall. Air along with fuel is fed into the
engine from behind the thrust-wall. The detonation wave created travels
forward to the thrust wall at about Mach 4 and compresses the fuel-air
mixture, promotes supersonic combustion and causes a pressure rise in the
engine. The wave then strikes the thrust wall and rebounds accelerating
the combustion products towards the nozzle. Some of the products are
ejected by the wave to the outside air-stream through the air inlet
openings creating a toroidal vortex out side the engine. Then the cycle
repeats.

The said advantages of this type of engine are: 
* Theoretically a higher fuel efficiency than a "constant pressure engine" 
* Engines can be produced in many sizes and thrust outputs from a few 
  inches in diameter at a thrust of several pounds to  larger one that can
  output in the thousands of pounds range. 
* They have high thrust to weight ratio (ie.lighter engine, more thrust) 
* They are mechanically simple, and have few moving parts. 
* They could operate in or out of the atmosphere using fuel oxidizers.


There is very little information on the other reported aircraft. It is
reported as "A triangular-shaped, quiet aircraft". This craft has been
seen by many observers and flying with several F-117 stealth aircraft.

6.02: NASA Footage September 12th 1992
--------------------------------------
Space Ice or an alien craft dodging a missile. That's the big debate on
the footage taken by an unmanned camera on the 13th flight of OV-103
space shuttle Discovery. One sidec says that it is space Ice accelerated
by the space shuttles thrusters. The other side says the excelleration of
some the objects don't follow the correct paths don't match physics. They
speculate its a alien craft dodging a Starwars missile.

6.03: Planetoid (Wormwood)
--------------------------
Beyond Pluto astronomers believe there is a ring of ice chunks circling
the solar system 37 to 59 A.U. from the sun. They have called the ice
belt the Kuiper belt. Beyond that astronomers say there is a similarly
composed Oort cloud which forms a sphere around our planetary system that
stretches two light years in distance. A tiny red spot of light was
recorded in hawaii in October of 92,  which is thought to be the first
component of the Kuiper belt ever observed. The object was named 1992 QB1.
It is about 200 km across and 5.1 billion km away from the sun (41.2
a.u.). The object is fairly red, suggesting a surface rich in organics.
The current position is, for 0h UT on September 15, 1992:  0h 00.09+0d
01'.7 (2000.0). It is moving retrograde at only 3" per hour. David Jewitt
and Jane Luu discovered it using the University of Hawaii's 2.2-meter
telescope on Mauna Kea.  They have been searching for such an object for
the last five years. The first images were secured August 30, but just as
with the discovery of Pluto in 1930 the discovery was kept "under wraps"
for awhile to allow a better assessment. Jewitt believes it to be one of
the larger members of the Kuiper belt. Jewitt says that it will take two
months to confirm the object.

Another theory involving the planetoid comes to us from channelers. It is
a hollowed out body that was moved here by the Reptoids, in order to
transport an army of Grays or Reptoids. [sorry, I'm not sure which, I
haven't had a chance to research this in-depth] It is now  parked outside
the orbit of Pluto.  It is currently being used as a base by the
Reptoids.

Then there is also the theory that the planetoid may be the star that is
mentioned in the Bible as "Wormwood" (also translated as "bitterness");
which when the "third angel" in the book of Revelation blew his trumpet,
fell to the earth and poisoned one third of the earths waters.  Another
interesting fact is that "chernobyl" (as in the Nuclear power plant in
"Russia" that had a meltdown) in Ukranian also means Wormwood.

6.04: Project Blue Book
-----------------------
On Sep 30 ,1947  Lt General Twining of ACM expressed his opinion that there
was sufficient substance in reports to warrant a study on UFOs. On Dec.
23,1947 Project Sign was established to collect, collate, evaluate, and
disseminate all information concerning UFO sightings and phenomena.
Project sign completed it evaluations in Feb of 1949 and concluded "No
definite and conclusive evidence is yet available that would prove or
disprove the existence of these UFOs as real aircraft of unknown and
unconventional configuration." Project Sign was changed to Project Grudge
on Dec.16, 1948. Project Grudge recommended that the investigation and
study of UFO reports be reduce in scope. In early 1950 UFO reports by the
public increased. This prompted Project Grudge to be changed to Project
Blue Book in march of 1952.
 
Project Blue Book goals were to find out: 
1: To find an explanation for all the reported sighting of UFO's. 
2: To determine if the UFO posed any security threat to the United States.
3: To determine if UFO's exhibit any advanced technology which the U.S.
   could Utilize.

When the project ended the Air Force concluded:
1: There is no evidence that any UFOs are "extraterrestrial vehicles"
2: No UFO has ever given any indication of a threat to the national
   security. 
3: There is no evidence that UFO's represent technological developments
   or principals beyond present-day scientific knowledge.

You can get the project Blue Book papers from Any Federal Repository which
has copies of National Archives material (there are various scattered
around the country). Or, you can go to the National Archives in
Washington, DC. They're on microfilm, like the Census records that
genealogists use.

Project Blue Book: The Top Secret UFO Findings Revealed,

6.05: Roswell Crash Incident
----------------------------
  The Roswell Incident started with sightings of UFOs on June 24, 1947. In
July 2,  of the sane year Mac Brazel heard a loud crash.  The next day he
went out Horseback riding with a neighbor and came upon a field with
debris scattered about.

 The debris field was 3/4 of a mile long and 300 feet wide. It was
oriented in a northwest to southeast direction.  There was a gouge in the
northwest side of the debris field that was 500 feet long and 10 feet
wide.  The debris on the field mostly consisted of I-beams and parchment
like, paper thin pieces of metal material. The material was very light in
weight, a dull gray in color, and most pieces were 6 to 7 inches in
length.  Some pieces that were even thinner that paper could not be
broken in half,  cut or burned.
  Mac Brazel collected several pieces of the debris and went back to his
ranch.  On July 6,  Brazel went into Roswell to report what he had seen
and to show a piece of the debris to sheriff Wilcox. The sheriff decided
to call the local air base. During this time Frank Joyce called in from
the local radio station to see if anything newsworthy was happening
around town. Brazel gave him the information about what he had found.
  Major Jesse A. Marcel and a few other military personal arrived from
the base only a few minutes after the sheriff had finished  talking to
the people at the base.  Brazel and the military personal left and went
back to the Ranch. The next morning (July 7) they went to the crash
sight. The military retrieved some of the debris and returned to Roswell.
  On July 8, the military came back and sealed off the area, They took
Brazel into custody.  That same day they found a second crash sight two
and 1/2 miles southeast of the first.  Barney Barnett and 4
archaeologists  had stumbled onto the new sight a few minutes before the
military had gotten there.  At the sight was found a "pretty good sized
metallic dull gray object" and 4 small alien bodies. They were 4 to 5
feet tall,  with large pair shaped heads, small bodies and skinny arms
and legs.  They had two large eyes,  no ears and no hair. Their skin was
pinkish grey and leathery.  They were wearing a one piece grey suits. The
civilians were escorted out of the area when the military arrived.

  On July 9th the military escorted Brazel to the radio station , there
he told Frank Joyce that he saw a weather balloon. He left again with the
military and didn't get back to his ranch until around July 15.  Later
when asked about what had happened Brazel said he had given a oath and
could not talk about it.
  The Incident remained closed and the public and  UFO research
organizations at large accepted the weather balloon story until 1970 when
Jesse A.  Marcel broke the silence and told his part in the story.

   - A program that originates from Pennsylvania, it has a pre-recorded
and a live section. The person who runs it sells packets of books by
mail-order. He likes to think that he is presenting irrefutable proof not
only of the existence of UFOs but also of the Government's Conspiracy to
keep them secret and frequently features people like Randall Terry.

   - an early 1980's half-hour show hosted by the man himself. The show
was similar to "In Search Of", in theme and content, a few of which covered
UFO's.

7.04: In Search Of (A&E)
----------------------
  - a late 1970's half-hour show, currently in syndication
(on A&E, right now), hosted by Leonard Nimoy.  Each show took on a
different unusual phenomenon, and gave a thumbnail sketch of the story of
it.  The show's format was decidedly non-sceptical, with lines like "could
it be that <'believer' side>?"  and "some believe that <believer side>".
UFO-related shows include "UFO", "UFO Australia", "UFO Captives", "Earth
Visitors", and several others, along with various non-UFO things -- Loch
Ness Monster, Bigfoot, Killer Bees, Atlantis, Reincarnation, DB Cooper,
Shroud of Turin, and some fairly mundane things - Tornados, Volcanos, and
Earthquakes.  The Fox network show "Sightings" is very similar in theme,
but often devotes significantly less time to a given subject.

"Revelations of Awareness" published by Cosmic Awareness Communications

Revelations of Awareness is a Newsletter that covers UFO as they relate
to channeling and the New Age movement.  All the information given in the
newsletter is information recorded from channeling sessions. The format
of of the news letter begins with a question asked of the Cosmic
Awareness, then replies are given by the Awareness through the rest of
the news letter starting out with the phrase "This Awareness indicates..."

The following Statement appears at the top of every Issue:

Cosmic Awareness is the force that expressed Itself through Jesus of
Nazareth, the Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Edgar Cayce and other great
avatars who served as 'Channels' for the 'Heavenly Father' and who speaks
again today as the world begins to enter the 'New Age' of spiritual
consciousness and awareness. Since 1963 Cosmic Awareness has been
communicating through carefully trained channels. This information is for
those who desire to help in bringing in the new age. Throughout the
thousands of 'Readings' given through these various channels, Cosmic
Awareness tells us not to believe anything, but to question, explore,
doubt, and discover for yourself, through your own channel what is the
truth. Cosmic Awareness will only 'indicate' and 'suggest'. Neither C.A.C
or any of the Interpreters is responsible for anything Cosmic Awareness
states in any of these readings, nor does C.A.C. or the Interpreters
necessarily agree with the statements of Cosmic Awareness. The
interpreters interpret the energies as they see them in trance levels and
are not personally responsible for what is said. This is entirely the
responsibility of the editor. Members of C.A.C. are invited to send in
questions of general interest to ask Awareness for possible publication
in this newsletter.

file, and to solicit contributions and book comments for it.  The file

also again by date-of-publication, and also includes Keith Rowell's
excellent bibliography file (which is also worked into the above two
parts).  Many titles have comments from various people as to the value of
the book; I would like any comments on any of the books from anyone, and
also additional books for inclusion. Check out the UFO Bibliography that
you can ftp at:

NASA Pics Sites
----------------
NOTE: the material at these sites is exceedingly voluminous; 
I'd strongly suggest just getting the CD-ROMs instead of attempting
to transfer scores of gigabytes of pix and other material.

To access the online catalog of NASA material, CD-ROMS, et cetera:

	telnet nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov
	login as "NODIS"
	no password

Anonymous ftp sites (five):

nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov [128.183.10.4]

	This is a VAX/VMS box, so you must ftp-login as "anonymous".  To get
	a dir listing into a file on your system:

	ftp> dir [...] file_on_your_system

vab02.larc.nasa.gov

	lots of stuff, including Aliens of all colors, and UFO pix (though  
this
	seems to mirror a lot of what's at phoenix.oulu.fi and has some
	additional material).

ames.arc.nasa.gov

	online copies of what appears to be all NASA's CD-ROMs, and lots of
	GIFs, *.img and *.jpg from most (all?) space missions since Apollo.

iris1.ucis.dal.ca

	dunno; it appears to be down today (Saturday, 18-July-1992).

archive.umich.edu

	apparently popular (and, hence, slow).  Is supposed to have many
	NASA and Voyager data files.
