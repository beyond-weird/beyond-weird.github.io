            Schiff Receives, Releases Roswell Report
         (missing documents leave unanswered questions)

Washington: Congressman Steve Schiff today released the General
Accounting Office (GAO) report detailing results of a records audit
related to events surrounding a crash in 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico,
and the military response.

The 20 page report is the result of constituent information requests to
Congressman Schiff and the difficulty he had getting answers from the
Department of Defense in the now 48-year-old controversy.

Schiff said important documents, which may have shed more light on what
happened at Roswell, are missing. "The GAO report states that the
outgoing  messages from Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) for this period of
time were  destroyed without proper authority." Schiff pointed out that
these messages would have shown how military officials in Roswell were
explaining to their superiors exactly what happened.

"It is my understanding that these outgoing messages were permanent
records, which should never have been destroyed. The GAO could not identify
who destroyed the messages, or why." But

    -more-

(page two)

Schiff pointed out that the GAO estimates that the messages were
destroyed over 40 years ago, making further inquiry about their
destruction impractical.

Documents revealed by the report include an FBI teletype and reference
in a newsletter style internal forum at RAAF that refer to a "radar
tracking device" - a reference to a weather balloon. Even though the
weather balloon story has since been discredited by the US Air Force,
Schiff suggested that the authors of those communications may have been
repeating what they were told, rather than consciously adding to what
some believe is a "cover up."

"At least this effort caused the Air Force to acknowledge that the
crashed vehicle was no weather balloon," Schiff said.  "That explanation
never fit the fact of high military security used at the time."  The Air
Force in September, 1994 claimed that the crashed vehicle was a then-
classified device to detect evidence of possible Soviet nuclear testing.

Schiff also praised the efforts of the GAO, describing their work as
"professional, conscientious and thorough."

A two page letter discussing a related investigation into "Majestic 12"
was also delivered.

Schiff will be available to the media Saturday, July 29th, from 10:00 AM
to 2:00 PM (Eastern) at 2404 Rayburn HOB in Washington, DC and by
telephone: (202) 225-6316.

A copy of the report may be obtained by calling (202) 512-6000 and

The Honorable Steven H. Schiff
House of Representatives

Dear Mr. Schiff:

In response to your request, we asked several agencies for their views
on the authenticity of the publicly circulated written material referred
to as Majestic 12.  The origin of this material is unknown, but it is
purported to represent highly classi fied government records explaining
unidentified flying object recovery procedures and the crash of a disc-
shaped aircraft near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947.

Since the late 1980s, several federal agencies have been contacted by
nongovernmental persons and asked to comment on the authenticity of the
Majestic 12 material.  The agencies contacted include

- the Information Security Oversight Office (responsible for overseeing
the information security programs of all executive branch agencies that
create or handle classified national security information),

- the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Deputy for Security and
Investigative Programs, and

- the National Archives.

These agencies responded to the inquiries by stating that their
knowledge of Majestic 12 was limited to the written material submitted
to them by nongovernmental persons. These agencies added that they found
no records in their files relating to Majestic 12.  Moreover, the
agencies' overall conclusion concerning the authenticity of the Majestic
12 written material was the same-there is no evidence that the Majestic
12 written material constitutes actual documents originally created in
the executive branch.  According to the Information Security Oversight
Office and the Air Force, the Majestic 12 material should not be treated
as if it had ever been actually classified by an executive branch agency
or government official.  We

[fax page break]

94-0692

found nothing in our work that contradicts the conclusions reached by
these agencies.

We also asked the archivists at the Harry S. Truman and Dwight D.
Eisenhower libraries for their views on the authenticity of the Majestic
12 material. The archivists said that over the years they have received
several inquiries from the public concerning this material. In their
search for related records, including classified intelligence and
National Security Council documents, they found nothing that appeared to
fit the description of the Majestic 12 material or any references to
this particular designation.

Lastly, during our review of material received from the public by the
Information Security Oversight Office in connection with past Freedom of
Information Act requests, we came across a message dated November 17,
1980. The message, which appeared to have been originated by the
Operations Division of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI), contained the words "MJ Twelve."

We contacted AFOSI to determine the authenticity of the November 1980
message. In a letter dated February 28, 1995, the Commander, AFOSI,
Investigative Operations Center, advised us that a search of AFOSI files
failed to disclose any official record copy of the message. The
commander also advised us that in connection with an earlier Freedom of
Information Act request, AFOSI had been asked to determine the
authenticity of the message. At that time, AFOSI concluded that the
message was a forgery.

If you have any questions, please contact me on (202) 512-3504.

Sincerely yours,

The Honorable Steven H. Schiff
House of Representatives

Dear Mr. Schiff:
On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) public information
office in Roswell, New Mexico, reported the crash and recovery of a
"flying disc." Anny Air Forces personnel from the RAAF'S 509th Bomb
Group were credited with the recovery. The following day, the press
reported that the Commanding General of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, Fort
Worth, Texas, annoumced that RAAF personnel had recovered a crashed
radar-tracking (weather) balloon, not a "flying disc."

After nearly 50 years, speculation continues on what crashed at Roswell.
Some observers believe that the object was of extraterrestrial origin. In
the July 1994 Report of Air Force Research Regarding the Roswell
Incident, the Air Force did not dispute that something happened near
Roswell, but reported that the most likely source of the wreckage was
from a balloon-launched classified government project designed to
determine the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research. The debate on
what crashed at Roswell continues.

Concerned that the Department of Defense (DOD) may not have provided you
with all available information on the crash, you asked us to determine
the requirements for reporting air accidents similar to the crash near
Roswell and identify any government records concerning the Roswell
crash. 

We conducted an extensive search for government records related to the
crash near Roswell. We examined a wide range of classified and
unclassified documents dating from July 1947 through the 1950s. These
records came from numerous organizations in New Mexico and elsewhere
throughout DOD as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBl), the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council.
The full scope and methodology of our work are detailed at the end of
this report.



Page 1          GAO/NSIAD-95-187 Government Records


Results in Brief

In 1947, Army regulations required that air accident reports be
maintained permanently. We identified four air accidents reported by the
Army Air Forces in New Mexico during July 1947. All of the accidents
involved military aircraft and occurred after July 8, 1947-the date the
RAAF public information office first reported the crash and recovery of
a flying disc near Roswell. The Navy reported no air accidents in New
Mexico during July 1947. Air Force officials told us that according to
record-keeping requirements in effect during July 1947, there was no
requirement to prepare a report on the crash of a weather balloon.

In our search for records concerning the Roswell crash, we learned that
some government records covering RAAF activities had been destroyed and
others had not. For example, RAAF administrative records (from Mar. 1945
through Dec. 1949) and RAAF outgoing messages (from Oct. 1946 through
Dec. 1949) were destroyed. The document disposition form does not
indicate what organization or person destroyed the records and when or
under what authority the records were destroyed.  Our search for
government records concerning the Roswell crash yielded two records
onginating in 1947-a July 1947 history report by the combined 509th Bomb
Group and RAAF and an FBI teletype message dated July 8, 1947. The
509th-RAAF report noted the recovery of a "flying disc" that was later
determined by military officials to be a radar-tracking balloon. The FBI
message stated that the military had reported that an object resembling
a high-altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector had been
recovered near Roswell.  The other government records we reviewed,
including those previously withheld from the public because of security
classification, and the Air Force's analysis of unidentified flying
object (1) sightings from 1946 to 1953 (Project Blue Book Special Report
No. 14), did not mention the crash or the recovery of an airborne object
near Roswell in July 1947. Similarly, executive branch agencies'
responses to our letters of inquiry produced no other government records
on the Roswell crash.

Reporting Air Accidents

According to press accounts from July 1947, Army Air Forces personnel
from RAAF were involved in the recovery of an airborne object near
Roswell. Therefore, if an air accident report was prepared, it should
have

(1) According to Air Force regulation, an unidentified fIying object is
an airborne object that by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or
unusual features, does not conform to known aircraft or missiles or does
not correspond to Air Force definitions of familiar or known objects or
unidentified aircraft.

Page 2

been prepared in accordance with Army regulations. According to an Army
records management official, in 1947 Army regulations required that air
accident reports be maintained permanently. An Air Force official said
there was no similar requirement to report a weather balloon crash.

According to an Air Force official who has worked in the records
management field since the mid-1940s, air accident reports prepared in
July 1947 under Army regulations should have been transferred to Air
Force custody in  September 1947, when the Air Force was established as
a separate service. 

The Air Force Safety Agency is responsible for maintaining reports of
air accidents. We examined its microfilm records to determine whether
any air  accidents had been reported in New Mexico during July 1947. We
identified four air accidents during this time period. (2) All of the
accidents involved  military fighter or cargo aircraft and occurred
after July 8, 1947 --  the date the RAAF public information office first
reported the crash and  recovery of a "flying disc" near Roswell.
According to the Army Air Forces'  Report of Major Accident, these four
accidents occurred at or near the  towns of Hobbs, Albuquerque,
Carrizozo, and Alamogordo, New Mexico. Only  one of the four accidents
resulted in a fatality. The pilot died when the  aircraft crashed during
an attempted take-off.

Search for Records

In searching for government records on the Roswell crash, we were
particularly interested in identifying and reviewing records of military
units assigned to RAAF in 1947 -- to include the 509th Bomb Group, the
1st Air Transport Unit, the 427th Army Air Force Base Unit, and the
1395th  Military Police Company (Aviation).

Document disposition forms obtained from the National Personnel Records
Center in St. Louis, Missouri, indicate that in 1953, the Walker Air
Force  Base (formerly RAAF) records officer transferred to the Army's
Kansas City  records depository the histories of units stationed at
Walker Air Force Base.  These histories included the 509th Bomb Group
and RAAF for February 1947  through October 1947; the 1st Air Transport
Unit for July 1946 through June  1947; and the 427th Army Air Force Base
Unit for January 1946 to February  1947. We could not locate any
documentation indicating that records of the  1395th Military Police
Company (Aviation)

(2) These records do not include information regarding mishaps of air
vehicles belonging to civilian or other government agencies. These
records  also do not include mishaps involving unmanned air vehicles
such as remotely  piloted aircraft, low-speed cruise missiles, and most
balloons.

were ever retired to the National Personnel Records Center or its
predecessor depositories. 

The July 1947 history for the 509th Bomb Group and RAAF stated that the
RAAF public information office "was kept quite busy . . . answering
inquiries on the 'flying disc,' which was reported to be in [the]
possession of the 509th Bomb Group. The object turned out to be a radar
tracking balloon." By his signature, the RAAF's commanding officer
certified that the report represented a complete and accurate account of
RAAF activities in July 1947. (Excerpts from the report are contained in
app. I.)

In addition to unit history reports, we also searched for other government
records on the Roswell crash. In this regard, the Chief Archivist for the
National Personnel Records Center provided us with documentation indicating
that (1) RAAF records such as finance and accounting, supplies, buildings 
and grounds, and other general administrative matters from March 1945 
through December 1949 and (2) RAAF outgoing messages from October 1946
through December 1949 were destroyed. According to this official, the
document disposition form did not properly indicate the authority under 
which the disposal action was taken. The Center's Chief Archivist stated 
that from his personal experience, many of the Air Force organizational 
records covering this time period were destroyed without entering a citation
for the governing disposition authority. Our review of records control forms 
showing the destruction of other records-including outgoing RAAF messages 
for 1950-supports the Chief Archivist's viewpoint. 

During our review of records at FBl headquarters, we foumd a July 8,
1947, teletype message from the FBI office in Dallas, Texas, to FBI
headquarters and the FBl office in Cincinnati, Ohio. An FBI spokesperson
confirmed the authenticity of the message.

According to the message, an Eighth Air Force headquarters official had
telephonically informed the FBl's Dallas office of the recovery near
Roswell of a hexagonal-shaped disc suspended from a large balloon by
cable. The message further stated that the disc and balloon were being
sent to Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio) for
examination. According to the Eighth Air Force official, the recovered
object resembled a high-altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector.
The message stated that no further investigation by the FBI was being
conducted. (A copy of the teletype message appears in app. II.)


Page 4

To follow up on the July 8th message, we reviewed microfilm abstracts of
the FBI Dallas and Cincinnati office activities for July 1947. An
abstract prepared by the FBI Dallas office on July 12, 1947, summarized
the particulars of the July 8th message. There was no mention in the
Cincinnati office abstracts of the crash or recovery of an airborne
object near Roswell.

Because the FBI message reported that debris from the Roswell crash was
being transported to Wright Field for examination, we attempted to
determine whether military regulations existed for handling such debris.
We were unable to locate any applicable regulation. As a final step, we
reviewed Air Matenel Command (Wnght Field) records from 1947 to 1950 for
evidence of command personnel involvement in this matter. We found no
records mentioning the Roswell crash or the examination by Air Materiel
Command personnel of any debris recovered from the crash.

Queries to Federal
Agencies Regarding
Records on the Crash

We sent letters to several federal agencies asking for any government
records they might have concerning the Roswell crash. In this regard, we
contacted DOD, the National Security Council, the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of
Energy.

The National Security Council, the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy, and the Department of Energy responded that they had
no government records relating to the Roswell crash. (Copies of their
responses appear in app. III, IV, and V.) The FBI, DOD, and the CIA
provided the following information.

Federal Bureau of
Investigation

The FBI informed us that all FBI data regarding the crash near Roswell
had been processed under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
previously received by the Bureau. We reviewed the FBI'S FOIA material
and identified the July 8, 1947, FBI teletype message discussing the
recovery near Roswell of a high-altitude weather balloon with a radar
reflector. (A copy of the FBI's response appears in app. VI.)

Department of Defense

DOD informed us that the U.S. Air Force report of July 1994, entitled
Report of Air Force Research Regarding the Roswell Incident, represents
the extent of DOD records or information concerning the Roswell crash.
The Air Force report concluded that there was no dispute that something


Page 5


happened near Roswell in July 1947 and that all available official
materials indicated the most likely source of the wreckage recovered was
one of the project MOGUL balloon trains. At the time of the Roswell
crash, project MOGUL was a highly classified U.S. effort to determine
the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research using balloons that carried
radar reflectors and acoustic sensors. (A copy of DOD'S response appears
in app. VII.)

Central Intelligence
Agency

In March 1995, the CIA'S Executive Director responded to our letter of
inquiry by stating that earlier searches by the CIA for records on
unidentifled flying objects produced no information pertaining to the
Roswell crash. The Executive Director added, however, that it was
unclear whether the CIA had ever conducted a search for records
specifically relating to Roswell. In the absence of such assurance, the
Executive Director instructed CIA personnel to conduct a comprehensive
records search for information relating to Roswel1. On May 30, 1995, the
CIA's Executive Director informed us that a search aganst the term
"Roswell, New Mexico," in all CIA databases produced no CIA documents
related to the crash. (A copy of CIA'S response appears in app. VIII.)

Agency Comments

A draft of this report was provided to DOD for comment. DOD offered no
comments or suggested changes to the report. The Chief Archivist,
National Personnel Records Center offered several comments clarifying
matters dealing with records management. These comments have been
incorporated into the final report where appropnate.

The CIA, the Department of Energy, the FBl, the National Security
Council, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
also received excerpts from the report discussing the activities of
their respective agencies. They had no substantive comments and made no
suggested changes to the report.

Scope and
Methodology

To determine the requirements for reporting air accidents in 1947, we
interviewed military service records management officials, reviewed
military record-keeping regulations in effect during this time penod,
and examined Army Air Forces and Navy air accident reports.

We also sought to identify any government records related to the Roswell
crash. In this regard, we visited and reviewed records at the locations
listed in table 1.

Our search of government records was complicated by the fact that some
records we wanted to review were missing and there was not always an
explanation. Further, the records management regulations for the
retention and disposition of records were unclear or changing during
the period we reviewed.

We also queried the National Security Council, the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Energy, the FBl, DOD,
and the CIA to determine what government records they have on the
Roswell crash. We did not independently verify the information provided
to us in their written responses.

In addition to physically examining govermnent records, we contacted the
following federal activities to determine whether they had any
information about the Roswell crash:

Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama;
Air Force Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio;
Army Center for Mihtary History, Washington, D.C.; and
509th Bomb Wing, Office of the Historian, Whiteman Air Force Base,
Missouri.

We conducted our review from March 1994 to June 1995 in accordance with
generally accepted government auditing standards.  Unless you publicly
announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this
report until 30 days after its issue date. At that time, we will make
copies available to other interested parties upon request.

The other three briefings were those which were given to the VIP and a
simulated briefing to a large group of Air Scouts representing all of
the troops in New Mexico which was given on 16 July 1947.

Several small projects were completed during the month including signs
on all the office doors, a building directory and a world situation map
which is maintained on a day-to-day basis.

The Historical Section of S-3 has been seriously handicapped by the
removal of the regular stenographer with the reduction in force.

Due to the fact that the quality of the department reports has in
general been so inadequate, lectures are being prepared to be given
early in August to properly train the liaison representatives of each
department.

The Office of Public Information was kept quite busy during the month
answering inquiries on the "flying disc", which was reported to be in
the possession of the 509th Bomb Group. The object turned out to be a
radar tracking balloon.

The main project of the month was making all preparations for a
successful Air Force Day. Lt. Colonel Oliver LaFarge, Air Reserve Corps,
at Santa Fe, made arrangements for Colonel Blanchard to visit the
governor of New Mexico and ask him to declare A ir Force Day in New
Mexico on 1 August.

In a letter dated 30 March 1995, this Agency advised you that it would
conduct a comprehensive record search to aid in the completion of your
investigation of the crash of an airborne object near Roswell, New
Mexico, in July 1947. In accordance with your request, we have searched
all of our data bases against the terms "Project Mogul" and "Roswell,
New Mexico."

The search did not yield any documents related to either of these terms.
Therefore, this Agency has no information, beyond those records already
reviewed by Mr. Gary Weeter of your staff, relevant to your
investigation.

    Sincerely,
