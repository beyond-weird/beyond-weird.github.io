"...'the PROTOCOLS OF ZION were published as a deception (by the Russian
Secret Police), to make people believe they had to worry about the Jews.'

"...'throughout history it has been a ploy of the Illuminati to dub anyone
who told the truth as an anti-Semite or a Nazi. They only prove my point
when they employ the same old tactics to shut people up and to intimidate
them. They don't know what to do with me, because I don't intimidate and
don't shut up.'

"Cooper states that he has traced the history of the nefarious Illuminati
all the way back to the Ancient Temple of Wisdom in Cairo, long before the
birth of Christ. 'The Illuminati exist today under many different names and
many different occupations.' Cooper told us. 'They practice Hegalian
conflict/resolution. They appear to oppose each other at the bottom ranks
(like the 'apparent' conflict between socialist Freemasonry and fascist
Romanism? - Branton), but at the highest levels they are actually
organizing and controlling the conflict which they have created to produce
the solution that they seek.

"'The Illuminati are extremely powerful, very wealthy men. They believe
that they are the guardians of the secrets of the ages. They believe that
the vast majority of people would not know what to do with the real
knowledge and the real truth and the real science -- and would, in fact,
misuse them all. They further believe that everything that they do is for
the ultimate betterment and survival of humankind -- even if it means
killing two billion people to reach their goal...'"

One possible area (aside from the so-called 'DREAMLAND' facility mentioned
by William Cooper) which also lies within the Mojave Desert region and
which also may connect to the alleged subsurface network is 'Iron
Mountain', one of the peaks in the El Paso Mountains northeast of Mojave,
California. There are many bizarre accounts connected with this mountain,
which apparently got it's name in part from the many old iron mines which
can be found there, along with numerous natural cavities which open out to
the surface in many different areas. The area has allegedly been the site
of certain activity concerning native American Indian occult practices, as
well as the site of alleged secret government activity, some of which
reportedly involves the observation and monitoring of strange creatures
and/or automatons which are said to emerge from underground openings in the
area on certain occasions. Just exactly what these 'creatures' are is
uncertain, but some accounts indicate that they are dangerous! Could this
also be a 'magnetic anomaly' zone due to the high iron content? There have
been mysterious references to time-space windows in the area as well.

Flying Ace John Lear, in 'statements' released over Computer 'Bulletin
Boards' devoted to researching the unknown (such as the PARANET BBS) has
stated:

     "...If the government won't tell us the truth and the major
     networks won't even give it serious consideration then what is
     the big picture, anyway? [Note: This was written before such
     programs as SIGHTINGS, ENCOUNTERS, UNSOLVED MYSTERIES, CURRENT
     AFFAIR, MONTEL WILLIAMS, NOW IT CAN BE TOLD and other TV programs
     DID in fact begin dealing with the UFO phenomena, abductions, and
     related phenomena in much greater depth - Branton], Are the
     EBE's, having done a hundred thousand or more abductions
     (possibly millions worldwide), built AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF SECRET
     UNDERGROUND BASES (Groom Lake, Nevada; Sunspot, Datil, Roswell,
     and Pie Town, New Mexico, just to name a few) getting ready to
     return to wherever they came from? Or, from the obvious
     preparations are we to assume that they are getting ready for a
     big move? or is (it) the more sinister and most probable
     situation that the invasion is essentially complete and it is all
     over but the screaming?

     "A well planned invasion of Earth for it's resources and benefits
     would not begin with mass landings or ray-gun equipped aliens. A
     properly planned and executed invasion by a civilization
     thousands... of years in advance of us would most likely be
     complete before a handful of people, say 12?, realize what was
     happening. No fuss, no mess. The best advice I can give you is
     this: Next time you see a flying saucer and are awed by its
     obvious display of technology and gorgeous lights of pure color -
     RUN LIKE HELL! -- June 3, 1988 Las Vegas, NV"

The above is just one excerpt taken from Lear's lengthy 'Press Release'
describing recoveries of alien craft and their occupants, accounts which
Lear claims to have learned from 'inside' sources. Lear has also stated:

     "...In 1983 when the Grand Deception was discovered MJ-12 (which
     may now be designated 'PI-40') started work on a weapon or some
     kind of device to contain the EBE's which had by now totally
     infested our society. This program was funded through SDI which,
     coincidentally, was initiated at approximately the same date. A
     frantic effort has been made over the past 4 years by all
     participants. (The beginning of the "retaliation" projects
     apparently began in 1979, when the DULCE and DREAMLAND massacres
     reportedly occurred - Branton) This program ended in failure in
     December of 1987. A new program has been conceived but will take
     about 2 years to develop. In the meantime, it is absolutely
     essential to MJ-12 (PI-40), that no one, including the Senate,
     the Congress or the citizens of the United States of America (or
     anyone else for that matter) become aware of the real
     circumstances surrounding the UFO cover-up and (the) TOTAL
     DISASTER it has become."

In their QUARTERLY REPORT, July - September 1990, the 'Fund For UFO
Research' (P. O. Box 277., Mount Rainier, MD 20712), related the following:

     "Dear Supporter:

     "I'm writing to you at a critical time in the history of the UFO
     movement. The issues contained in this letter are extremely
     sensitive, and so I would appreciate your confidentiality.

     "Because of your support for scientific research into the UFO
     phenomena, I want to bring you up-to-date on recent events which
     may result in a resolution of the mystery of Unidentified Flying
     Objects.

     "As you know, there is a great deal of interest currently in the
     apparent crash of one or more UFOs in New Mexico over 43 years
     ago. This event has become the most intensively- investigated --
     and best documented -- case in UFO history.

     "It came to the public's attention in 1980 with the publication
     of 'THE ROSWELL INCIDENT' by Charles Berlitz and William Moore.
     With the capable assistance of veteran UFO investigator and
     nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman, the authors documented that
     SOMETHING very unusual crashed in the New Mexico desert in July
     1947.

     "Friedman and Moore continued to follow up on new leads and
     uncovered new evidence following publication of the book. During
     the course of their research, they identified nearly 100
     witnesses who had information about the event.

     "However, the focus of their investigation changed with the
     release of apparently authentic documents outlining Operation
     Majestic Twelve, a TOP SECRET government research project
     initiated following the Roswell crash. The Fund for UFO Research
     awarded Mr. Friedman a $16,000 grant to investigate the
     documents, and his research into the MJ-12 matter inevitably
     turned up new witnesses in the Roswell event.

     "In the meantime, Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle, under the
     auspices of the Center for UFO Studies, decided to reexamine the
     Roswell case and managed to bring the number of first-hand
     witnesses and sources of information to more than 200..."

In the May, 1989 issue of 'Leading Edge' (formerly 'Nevada Aerial
Research') it was stated that: "...Information about underground bases at
Edwards AFB (CA) are not new. Stories have circulated for years. There was
the lady whose mother used to work at the cafeteria who overheard people
talking about aliens and disks. The constant stream of construction
materials going out to the end of the base, but nothing showed up on the
surface. NASA has a large underground base that has been there for years.

"'Tube shuttles take personnel 50 miles to the other end of the base in the
Tahachapi mountains. The underground base has been referred to as an
underground city. It is even said that there are disks stored in glasslike
enclosures under a vacuum to preserve them.'"

What may very well be a confirmation of the above appeared in the Dec. 1990
issue of a publication sent out by 'THE BORDERLAND SCIENCES RESEARCH
FOUNDATION', which had for years been under the direction of Riley H.
Crabb. The information was in the form of a letter which we quote here:

"...I spent the weekend with a 'recent' Edwards AFB workman and his wife --
'recent' because they are both repeat contactees and have become
'unmanageable' as the AFB management puts it. He was fired for blasting a
Spybee with spray paint -- which I find funny and as classic as the
graffiti on New York subway cars.

"'You did it on purpose,' they told him, and they knew of course, because
the Spybees are telepathic (i.e. capable of 'tuning in' to Extremely Low
Frequency or 'ELF' electro- encephalographic neuro-brain wave patterns -
Branton) as well as camera equipt. They also carry microphones. We were all
laughing as he told us how the little spray-painted gold orb, blinded, went
bouncing off walls and posts and was quickly withdrawn from its spy
mission. He said Spybees are about the size of a basketball. They fly by
antigravity all over any 'Above Top Secret' installation. They dart
soundlessly everywhere and hover between workers, sometimes programmed to
harass the guys for fun, like bumping them in the rear end.

"No person (that) he and his friends knew about there was allowed to say
one word to another while on the job. They would test by trying to write to
each other in the floor dust. Within two or three strokes a Spybee would
whiz around the corner, lock on to and stop above the writing. His last
comment was to write and draw a great big 'screw you'.

"His painting work was part of an ONGOING EXCAVATION beneath Edwards AFB on
the high DESERT in California. He and his crew were always blindfolded and
strip-searched before transit. They couldn't even have watches. BY TAKING
TURNS COUNTING IN THE ELEVATOR GOING TO AND FROM THE WORK SITE, THEY
ESTIMATED IT MUST BE SOME 9,000 FEET DOWN, AT LEAST TWO MILES, AND THE TRIP
TOOK ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

"Management accused him of doing it on purpose, and they knew... 'No, no.
The Spybee kept bumpin the back of my neck while I was sprayin. After one
real hard knock I whirled around with the spray gun still goin.'"

"A prominent researcher with us that Saturday evening suggested, after
careful questioning of the worker, THAT THE ELEVATOR ITSELF WAS
ANTI-GRAVITIC, AS THERE WERE NO CABLES; SO THE ESTIMATED DISTANCE WAS AT
BEST MINIMUM. ALL PRESENT CONFIRMED THE GOVERNMENT'S POSSESSION OF PLASMOLE
TUNNELING MACHINES WHICH MELT A 50 FOOT HOLE THROUGH SOLID ROCK, AT A RATE
OF ABOUT FIVE MILES PER HOUR.

"For part of the night we went 'foo chasing', their term for sightseeking
UFOs. Tahachapi (is) where H. Hughes and Northrup Corporations and the USAF
have just imported Delta Forces and fleets of black helicopters deployed by
the government for top security events coverage. There is no doubt
something major going on up there... even that night.

"The researcher and his team were hoping to see the 30- FOOT VERSION OF THE
SPYBEES, as there are growing numbers of reports on these. THEY ARE
DESIGNED TO FLY OVER YOUR HOUSE CARRYING SURVEILLANCE BEAMS FOR
THOUGHT/EMOTION CONTROL AND BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION (Note: Since thoughts and
emotions may be to some extent electromagnetic in nature, it may be
possible for them to be manipulated by EM rays - Branton).

"...I often see Terra now as in near-final throes of exactly the H.G. Wells
scenario where the unwilling and witless 90% of mankind inhabits a
play-fantasy world on Earth's surface, while the split-off race of highly
technical degenerates (in league with and/or controlled by the serpent
race? - Branton), the Trogs, prey on them from underground..."

The following information was sent to us via a researcher who is
investigating a continuous abduction of a young (at the time) nine-year-old
boy in southern Nevada, who may have been taken to underground levels below
that same area. Names, addresses and other details have been deleted on
request to protect the privacy of the sources. We quote from a series of
notes based on the young boys' experiences, exactly as they were sent to a
member of "the Group", with our emphasis added:

1: The 'greys', he says they don't use words but communicate THROUGH him.
THEY SHOW THEIR DIS- PLEASURE BY WRINKLING THEIR NOSES AND PURSING THEIR
LIPS WITH A SLIGHT HISSING SOUND AT HIM.

2: HE SAYS HE FEELS LIKE HE'S BEING WATCHED WHEREVER HE GOES (Note: This is
a very common observation made by people who claim to have experienced
aerial AND/OR subsurface abductions or encounters with non- human aliens -
Branton).

3: This is what they look like to him (a drawing was included depicting a
traditional 'gray' with a somewhat 'wiry' build - Branton).

4: This is what the uniform they wear looks like to him. He says the box in
the middle has different colored flashing buttons.

5: This is the large 'boat', A SORT OF FLOATING ISLAND HE WAS BROUGHT TO
(Note: Some aspects of the abduction suggest that the young boy was taken
to a large network of water-filled subterranean caverns - Branton). THERE
WERE MANY 'HYBRIDS' ON IT ALSO.

6: These are the hybrids he sees. He says that they sit in a large circle
holding hands. There is one small candle with a very large flame going. HE
SAYS HE IS NOT AFRAID OF THE HYBRIDS.

(Note: These may have been so-called "hu-brids" with a human soul-energy
"matrix". These according to different accounts are more or less 'slaves'
to the grays and reptoids/ reptons from birth. Many of the women who claim
to have been 'impregnated' during abductions and who have had their 'child'
removed from them a few months into its term are allegedly carriers to
these hybrids or hu-brids, although it is possible that re-brids or
'hybrids' without a soul-matrix (more saurian than human) might be gestated
in this manner also. The hu-brids are allegedly taken to underground bases
beneath the surface of the earth and/or possibly installations on or below
other planetary spheres. The ritual that the hybrids were apparently forced
to undertake might be part of a psychic warfare operation against humans
that their reptilian overlords are waging. It is interesting that
Satanists-Illuminists have been known to gather in a circle and meditate on
a candle flame in order to induce a state of astral projection, or
projection of the spirit form (some have erroneously referred to is as
"soul projection" - the "soul body" however can only separate itself from
the physical form at death. - Branton)

"THERE IS A FEMALE (hu-brid - Branton) who BLENDS with him and he says it
feels very peaceful and good. When asked if the greys were the only aliens
he sees, HE DREW THE REPTILIAN, THESE ARE THE UNIFORMS ON THEM ALSO. HE
SAYS THE GREYS COME TO GET HIM, BUT THEY FOLLOW THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
REPTILIANS. HE CALLED IT A LIZARD. HE SAID HE SEES HUMAN BEINGS - ALIVE -
HANGING FROM A WALL WITH NO EYES, OR MOUTHS LEFT.

"Please share with us your input on how to help this boy. We know what is
happening here and we are ready and willing to do anything we have to. Love
& Light, sincerely (Names deleted by request)."

The above is not, unfortunately, a singular case. MANY people are now
coming forward with stories of alien abuse, or of being abducted to
underground 'bases' controlled by small 'grayish' or large 'Reptilian'
beings. In previously years most of these people have been terrified at the
prospect of telling their stories, for fear of ridicule. Before the
'abduction' phenomena was widely known, many such people who spoke out
about alien experiences actually ended up in psychiatric institutions, so
there was at that time a definite danger of 'talking' too much about their
horrifying encounters. Added to this is the official governmental denial of
the phenomena, or even outright attempts to 'silence' those who knew too
much for supposed "National Security" reasons (actually it was/is
"Establishment Security" they were interested in). However at this point in
time when radio, television and even motion pictures are giving the subject
another (this time more respectable and honest) look, many more people are
gathering the courage to come forward with reports of abductions by
malevolent -- or contacts with benevolent -- 'aliens'.

In the hidden depths of the Nevada Military Complex a battle is raging. Few
know just how long it has been going on. Apparently it began several years
ago when the Nevada Test Site workers discovered vast subterranean cavities
deep underground, "possibly" as a result of the underground nuclear blasts
which had artificially excavated huge cavities deep below the surface.

This activity apparently corresponded with the same general time-period
when the U.S. Secret Government was making deals with the 'Grays',
establishing secret locations such as S-4 to study alien craft that had
crashed, and constructing environ- mental enclosures for some of the 'few'
alien beings that had been apprehended alive. Much of this activity
allegedly took place and is taking place within the extreme high-security
areas on and below the Nevada Military Complex.

However, the reports now coming out of the 'Complex' suggest that far more
than just a 'few' of the alien grays, and even their reptilian overlords,
are involved with the activities taking place in Nevada... more activity
than even a few alien survivors of crashed disks could account for. Many
accounts have spoken of vast caverns below the southern Nevada region which
'may' have been the ancient lairs of reptilian hominoids for decades or
centuries. All the accounts point to only one possible conclusion: That the
Test Site workers broke into the native habitat of these reptilian beings,
or a system of caverns which the reptilians had taken control of in the
recent or distant past. Possibly in an effort to prevent a unilateral
warfare between the two expanding 'worlds', the secret government decided
to establish a treaty with the saurian Grays (apparently the Grays tried to
convince the human governments that they had "originated" from
other-stellar regions -- and that the humans had encountered one of their
underground "bases" -- in order to steer the humans clear of the fact that
many of them were native to the Terran Subterranea. This may have been a
half-lie, as the reptilians do reportedly have ancient facilities that they
have established and entrenched on other planetary bodies).

Aside from establishing "treaties" with the extraterrestrial "Grays" that
are apparently returning to their native planet, a secret treaty was also
made with their counterparts in the so-called 'underground bases'. Most of
the 'workers' would not be aware of the alien activity taking place in
these extreme lower levels due to the higher security clearances necessary
to enter or even KNOW of them. This could explain the confusion which seems
to exist, and the comments made by workers, especially within the Nevada
Military Complex, that everything is 'way out of control'.

It might also explain the comments made by others 'in the know' who have
suggested that the government is in a panic since they have learned that
the sauroid 'aliens from other stars' have infiltrated and undermined the
surface of the earth without us even knowing it, and that this is why they
are in such confusion, why they are rushing head-long to develop weapons
such as 'Excalibur' to destroy subterranean alien strongholds, and so on.

In the movie 'THEY LIVE', which depicted an infiltration of human society
utilizing underground 'bases' beneath major cities, one of the human
resistance' members asks: "How LONG have they been here?" Later he comes to
realize... "Maybe they've ALWAYS been here!" Perhaps the reason behind the
supposed alien infestation and undermining of the underground systems below
the surface of the earth could be explained by the possibility that they
have ALWAYS been here, or have been for some time. Do not accounts of
reptilian hominoids date back to prehistoric times when the dinosaurs
walked the surface of the earth? Keep this possibility in mind when trying
to fit the following revelations into your framework of reality.

Is it possible that a subterranean race -- working closely with others of
their kind which long ago left the earth for extraterrestrial realms -- is
staging (via subversion, implantation, disinformation, coversion, and
infiltration) a takeover of human society FROM ABOVE AND BELOW?

One group that is allegedly tied-in with the inner workings of the
government-alien interactions and/or conflicts are known as the 'Delta'
Forces. The Delta's, some claim, have secretly been recruited by the secret
government in order to perform certain functions in relation to the
so-called 'joint-interaction' projects involving deep-level government
organizations and the 'aliens' (saurian greys, etc.).

At the beginning of the 'interaction', the government was optimistic about
their new-found alliance with an apparently benevolent race of non-human
beings. When the government finally discovered the true nature of the
grays; and the fact that they' were using the 'treaties' with the U.S.
government merely as a means to further their infernal plans of bringing
the human race under their control, then according to various sources 'all
hell broke loose!' The government-CIA in their zeal to establish contact
with what they hoped were technological 'saviors' from the stars, had
'bargained away' much of what they had, including much of the sovereignty
of the United States and the World. When the 'Horrible Truth' was
discovered it was too late, the aliens had already established too much
control and their physical and occult conquests were increasing every day.
And the Delta's were caught right in the middle.

The Delta Groups (or National Recon Group), wear the 'Trilateral' insignia,
a black triangle on a red background. 'Delta' is also the fourth letter in
the Greek alphabet, which has the form of a triangle. The symbol appears
prominently in certain Masonic lodges, and is said to have had it's origin
with the aliens (or serpent race).

The Delta Forces were the major group who, according to some sources, were
involved in the attempted operation that was implemented to rescue several
scientists who were being held captive within the deepest levels of the
'Dulce' complex below northwestern New Mexico. These workers had stumbled
across the 'Horrible Truth', and according to reports over 66 persons, many
of them Delta Forces, were slaughtered by the inhuman inhabitants and
controllers of these lower levels. Others allege that Air Force Blue Berets
were also involved in this conflict, which was later to become known as the
'Dulce Wars'. Exactly what part the Air Force Blue Berets played, however,
is uncertain.

With this in mind, the reader might better understand the following
revelations which were released by former Naval Petty Officer and
Intelligence worker, William Cooper. On January 10, 1989, Mr. Cooper posted
the following statement on a computer network devoted to the investigation
of paranormal events:

     "The following information was extracted from a rather long
     treatise/transcript/conversation between an individual and
     another who was assigned to DELTA SECURITY:

     01: Delta security has a lot to do with inter-service projects.

     02: The Trilateral insignia (alien) is valid and has been used to
     mark equipment.

     03: 'The whole thing is grim and won't get any better.'

     04: The Trilateral insignia has been seen on a disk at Edwards
     AFB, CA and Area 51 in NV.

     05: There is a hanger at Edwards referred to as the Delta Hanger.

     06: The Delta Hanger is on the North Base at Edwards.

     07: You need a special badge to get near it. It is a red badge
     with a black triangle on the face of it and personal information
     on the back.

     08: Disk in hanger at Edwards described as having insignia on the
     underside and on the top. It was about 50' in diameter, appearing
     like tarnished silver, about 15 to 18 feet thick. There were what
     looked like windows around the raised portion that were mostly
     described as rectangular. There was a groove around the disk
     about 4 feet from the edge all the way around. There was an area
     on the bottom that looked like vents or louvers.

     09: When people assigned to Delta would break down and cry for no
     apparent reason, you would never see them again.

     10: Apparently, the NRO (National Recon Organization) recruits
     for DELTA out of Fort Carson, Colorado.

     11: Just about everyone assigned to DELTA are orphans, have no
     relatives, etc.

     12: There are 'bounty hunters' connected with Dreamland.

     13: If you work at Dreamland and go on leave or are not back on
     time they send 'bounty hunters' after you. That's where the
     'visitors' live...there is an underground facility...

     14: Area 51 is at Groom Lake in Nevada. The disks are flown
     there.

     15: One of the craft looked like an upside-down diamond.

     16: There is a radiation hazard apparent when some of the craft
     fly.

     17: No one stays at Dreamland for more than a few months.

     18: 'Everything is way out of control...'" (no longer under
     'human' control? - Branton)

The following conversation, in relation to the Nevada Military Complex and
the 'underground facilities', took place on the "Billy Goodman Happening" -
KVEG Radio 840 AM, Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 19, 1989. It was
transcribed by a Las Vegas resident.

Billy Goodman incidentally, has personally planned visits, in collaboration
with KNBC Radio in Los Angeles, to observe the 'disks' which are being
tested at Groom Lake. Goodman and others claimed to have seen these disks
in operation, and back up these claims with video documentation. One such
video shows a hovering object making a vertical ascent, stop in mid-air,
make a horizontal traverse, followed by another vertical ascent. Something
like this would be impossible for any conventionally known aircraft of the
time to duplicate. Billy Goodman, who has since moved to another radio
station in Los Angeles, has been very instrumental in getting the
information out about the underground base at Site 51 (or Area-51, the
'underground facility' where the 'visitors' live, according to Bill
Cooper's source whom we've just quoted). In the following annotated
transcript, the caller will be identified as 'C' and Billy Goodman as 'G':

G: Hi! Your on the Billy Goodman Happening on KVEG! Sir, what can I do for
you tonight?
C: O.K. Are you ready? Hang on to your seats! Here goes! We are going 3,000
feet underground! O.K. We get to that point, 3,000 feet. We come out into a
stainless steel atmosphere... and we come upon people that are ah...
construction people... working people, and so forth that are supposed to be
in that area. Then we come upon another people who push us into another
little room. They tell us, "Do not come out of that area, until your told
to." These guys are 6 minute marines, all right? They tell us, "If you do,
you are going to get hurt!" OK? So we are construction workers!
G: Where are you working? Where is what you are describing to us.
C: On a certain test site!
G: A certain test site! Which one? You can't reveal which one?
C: We're kinda mixed up! We don't know what the hell is going on. We're
making ah... good bucks... and everything has come down on us... and they
are hurting us! OK? So we are contractors! We are workers! OK? So there's a
person that I called and explained what is happening to me and they told me
to call you and tell you! So, that is what I am doing right now! Calling
you!
G: You presented it in a very odd way! First of all I didn't know if you
were going to be serious or what! Are you saying to me that you are a
construction worker and you had to go 3,000 feet under ground? First of all
what would you be doing underground? Let me ask you that!
C: We are running lights and power.
G: And who assigned you this job?
C: It's through Reynold's Electronics. I have to say that because I get my
pay check from someone else! (Note: Reynold's Electronics is a branch of
"E.G. & G." Corporation which DOES IN FACT work with and contract through
the Nevada and Utah Test Sites - Branton)
G: They tell you to put these lights underground?
C: Yeh, but there's more to it than that! I'm sortof afraid of expressing.
Am I talking to you or what?
G: Yes, you are talking directly to me!
C: OK. You know some of the things that are happening, shouldn't be. It
should be made public! The public should know what the hell is going on!
And it scares the hell out of me. What is not being brought out you know?
For example, can I give you an example? Here's an example! A few weeks back
we were inside a certain cavern going through stainless steel halls, going
north, and as we move along we are hanging lights. In the rooms are...
they're like operating rooms. All of a sudden, off the elevator, our U.S.
Marines come out, crash us down off our scaffold, pushing us down, and then
into a room. This is taking a hell of a lot out of me to tell you this
right now! The bosses come into the room and we're getting debriefed and
all this kind of stuff and all of a sudden they are carrying fixed
bayonets. Now I fought in Vietnam and I thought these guys were my buddies!
Oh, no way! Forget it! These guys are from outer space! (Note: There is a
slight possibility that the 'soldiers' which this man encountered were not
'human' marines, but we will deal with this bizarre possibility later on -
Branton) These people brought these little characters on gurneys, OK? They
had big heads and little bodies and they went into this little room. Then,
behind them, these doctors in white coats and stuff! And we was really at
ah... we didn't know what the hell was going on! We were shocked to hell!
...I was SCARED man!
G: Well, sure you didn't know what was going on and didn't expect it! I
guess them handling you upset you first of all. Being man to man, you
thought why should you treat me this way! And that's to be expected. As far
as knowing where you are I have no idea.
C: I know where I was! I worked there every day! I keep a log and if
someone asks me I know what's going on! I'm telling you man they're not
telling us the truth. There is something damn wrong within our government.
I only got a glimpse of this scientist on television (i.e. most likely
referring to Robert Lazar - Branton), but I know he's not telling much of
what he knows. I'm just a worker. A hammer and nail man. This guy's got
more brains than I do, and would know more about it than I do. There's
something INSIDE they aren't telling us!
G:OK. I understand that! Now what do you want us to do about it?
C: EXPOSE IT!!!
G: I think you've done that yourself, just now! Now you haven't told us
your location and I think that's important so we have some idea where this
is. I hope you understand at this moment...
C: I work at Mercury, Nevada and I'm the best electrician there. This is
between you and me now. I don't want anybody else to know about this!
G: But your on the air Sir!
C: You mean somebody knows about this besides you and me?
G: But you are talking over the radio, Sir! Everybody, all over the West
Coast that is listening has just heard you! So you've gotten your word out.
Now let's see if anybody else knows about it. Maybe just maybe, we'll get
some calls from some of the people that work with you.
C: Wait a minute! You mean somebody else knows about this beside you and
me?
G: Now, this is a talk show, you called a talk show. I am over the radio -
that's where you called!
C: OH, MY GOD!!!
G: Why, what's wrong with that? You called a talk show!
C: I thought I was just talking to you!
G: Now you said someone told you to call me. Was it someone you work with?
C: Yes.
G: Nobody knows who you are. You haven't said your name or anything! Now,
let's see if anyone will back up your story!
C: But I didn't know other people would hear this. Now I'm scared for my
life! There's tremendous stuff out there that's being hidden. It's being
corrupted inside. It's being stashed away.
G: Well that's what we do here. We are trying to bring the information out,
and it's people like yourself who are making that happen. They bring us
information all the time! Are you trying to bring the information out
yourself because you don't like what's going on?
C: I fear for my life because I've seen what happened. I fear for my life
because the government is lying to me.
G: OK. Why do you fear for your life? Have you been threatened?
C: Before you even go down in the pit they threaten you! That is you tell
anything of what you saw, you are dead!!!
G: But you're not saying more than what you saw. Is there anything else you
want to say before we say thank you for calling?
C: Yes, one other thing. Whenever it gets down to the nitty gritty, it will
be clear to the people, that what they are seeing on the news, is true!
We've got six little bodies under ground, man!!!
G: Please keep in touch, OK? (end of transcript)

The reference to Reynold's Electrical, by the way, may be explained more
fully in it's connection with E.G. & G., from the following reference which
we quote, from an article that appeared in a newspaper called the
REVIEW-JOURNAL, January 9th, 1990. This Associated Press article stated:

"Three Nevada-based EG&G companies employ most of the workers at the Nevada
TEST SITE, the nations' nuclear proving grounds 65 miles northwest of Las
Vegas.

"The companies employ 8,000 people: 1,500 at EG&G Energy Measurements Inc.;
1,000 at EG&G Special Projects; and 5,500 at Reynolds Electrical and
Engineering Co."

Actually, present officials working at the Nevada Test Site are apparently,
at least for the most part, refusing the advice of the FOUNDER of EG&G.,
Herald 'Doc' Edgerton, who once made the following statement at a meeting
of the Archaeological Society of America:

"Work like hell, TELL EVERYONE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW, close a deal with a
handshake, and have fun." Edgerton apparently was no supporter of 'official
secrecy', yet many of those now involved in this company are being
threatened to remain silent to the point of endangering their very lives if
they speak out about what they have seen. Incidentally, Robert Lazar was
hired by EG&G himself to work at the S-4 installation at Groom Lake. In
fact, we will now relate another conversation which took place on the
"Billy Goodman Happening" almost a week following the conversation which is
recorded above. There are apparently SOME EMPLOYEES working at the Nevada
Test Site, who ARE speaking out about what is going on there, like the one
who called in to the Billy Goodman show on Nov. 24, 1989, possibly in
response to the caller from Mercury, Nevada mentioned earlier, as well as
in response to Bob Lazar's own experiences.

The person who transcribed this particular taped program indicated that
they had missed the first 15 seconds or so of the callers conversation.
This is NOT the same caller whose conversation we just described. In the
following transcript, (C:) indicates 'Caller'; (G:) indicates Billy
'Goodman'; and (L.:) refers to Bob 'Lazar', who was Goodman's guest for
that evening. Beginning with the 'Caller':

C: ...Well, we're kinda fed up with what's going on, right! And I mean
nothing gets done without the ants! We are the ants! We are the
construction workers, O.K.? We put things together and take them apart! You
are the scientists (referring here to Robert Lazar - Branton). You do all
the higher level of knowledge stuff, right? We do all the putting in this
and putting in that: installing, construction and so forth! Well we heard
about your situation, and it's going through a whole bunch of grape vines,
O.K? It's coming together where people are meeting in small groups and
they're trying to organize a support for you to back you up! Out of the
meeting we had yesterday of 7 people, counting myself there are two that
will come forward and support you! What they SAW, what they are INVOLVED
WITH! The other guys are just scared to death and I'm a little scared
myself, you know!
L.: Do these people work in area S-4?
C: Yeh, all over the area!
L.: That would be great!
C: Mostly UNDERGROUND! The deep sections of the area! The whole thing!
G: How do you feel Bob? Sounds like you are getting some support!
L.:Yea, that's great! There's power in numbers!
C: We are trying to get things where it will be safe! You know what I mean
Bob?
L.:Oh yeh, I do!
C: It's kinda hard to talk to you like this you know but the guys are for
you! People are for you and everybody's wanted to do something a long time
ago but nobody knew what they could do.
L.: Yeh, that was the consensus when I was down there! Everybody wanted to
do something. I'm glad everyone has that attitude!
C: Yeh, you are probably the beginning of the first motion of the wheel you
know! The first turn! The wheel is gonna turn faster and faster in order to
get where we want to get to!
L.:Well hopefully that will be the case! Do you think these people would
come forward if there was some sort of congressional amnesty for them?
C: I don't know but we all know a lot! We know our jobs well, like you do!
L.:I'm sure you do.
C: What we have to do is be firm about it, get to the point and say, "Hey,
here's what's happening!" Why don't you tell the people what's happening?
Why keep it a secret? Like before you walk into those hangers there.
Somebody had to install this and install that! It's frightening. It scared
the heck out of me. We got together out at Lathrup Wells and kicked it
around. We B.S.'ed a little bit and said, "We gotta do something!" SO WE
DID SOMETHING YESTERDAY. Like I said: there's only two of the seven of us
who are willing to do something.
G:Sir, Sir! Is there anything we can do to help you in this matter? Is
there anything the listening people can do? I know they are behind Bob
Lazar 100%. I had him on here one night and there hasn't been one person by
either mail, or by telephone, who has disputed what he has said! So they
are behind him. Is there anything we can do?
C: Well you could form some kind of walk or picket! Or announce it on the
street. Tell them we want to know! WE WANT TO KNOW!!!
G:When you say on the street, are you talking about downtown Las Vegas?
C: YES!
G:What do you think of that Bob? Do you think that would do anything?
L.:Certainly if these people come forward! They have a LOT to lose, if
people start making a ruckus like that! They could lose their jobs right
away! They talked about there being a ten year jail term and a $10,000 fine
for divulging information like that! I mean they have a lot to lose! You
might...
G:But you know something Bob? It's almost like...
C: We have the first amendment on our side!
L.:Yeh, you do but... have you thought about contact(ing) George Knapp? (of
KLAS-TV, Las Vegas, who produced an entire series of UFO-based
documentaries after Lazar came forward with his story - Branton) He's
looking for anybody that is coming forward from S-4, and any surrounding
areas having knowledge at all about that area or any of the flying saucer
information! He's gathering all he can and doing alot to try and expose it!
G:You might want to contact George! That might be a good idea! But I think
there's another side to this. It's almost like they're not concerned any
more about their jobs. They're more concerned about the Constitution!
They're more concerned about Humanity! That's the impression I get!
L.:Yeh, you get that point but you have to feed yourself too!
G:Well you know, there are people that take chances in life, and sometimes
they wind up with something better. Later on... down the line. You know
what I'm saying? Someone like yourself. I'm not saying this would happen by
coming forward, taking a chance, and all of a sudden, say, the government
cut you off. You might get an offer for a better position. You follow what
I'm saying? Because there are people who own the businesses that believe
the way you believe. And I believe this! I hear this gentleman talking and
it's happening more and more. There are people out there who would LOVE to
come forward with information.
C: But somebody has to start it.
G:Right. And I think you've done that Bob! You started the ball rolling. I
know you did. I think what is going to happen is the people who have been
wanting to say something; this might be a relief for them. It's coming out
and they won't have to keep it inside any more!
L.:That was the general consensus when I was out there.
G:Well obviously they want out too. They want to tell the truth.
C: Bob, did you have any work underground? IN THE TUNNELS?
L.:No! I have a friend whose dad worked on some of the drilling equipment!
I know there's some tunnels down there!
C: There's more than just tunnels down there! There's everything you can
imagine down there. I know cause we put it up!!! We installed. We did
everything. I just want you to know that the M.W.s (Mercury Workers) are
gathering together in small groups trying to put something together for you
and contact you somehow to join you. If the people want to join us in a
march or whatever it's going to be, that's what we're going to do!
L.:Oh! That's super!
C: So we're with you man!
G:Thanks for the call sir! Have a nice night. Bob, it sounds as though
people are starting to come forward. (end of transcript)

Still on the subject of the strange events taking place in (and beneath)
southern Nevada, we quote here part of a letter written by a subscriber to
N.A.R. (Nevada Aerial Research - now Leading Edge Research), who made the
following statements:

"...Bob Lazar, the scientist, was talking about riding in a bus with the
windows blacked out and it brought back something an airline stewardess
told me last summer (1989). She said, 'I'm trying to relocate to another
part of the country right now. Once a week, I'm assigned to a flight that I
hate! We only have Armed Forces officers on THIS flight. Before we take
off, we are instructed to pull the window covers over the windows! After we
take off, we circle widely, about 15 minutes (it would be unnoticeable to
most people) - fly straight for 15 minutes, circle again about 15 minutes
and then land. After we land the flight crew is ushered into a lounge. A
half hour later we repeat the process back to Las Vegas. The people are all
different on the return trip. We are told, 'Don't tell anyone about these
flights!' I just can't stand the tension on this flight!' (Note: just what
did she mean when she says the "people are different" on the return flight
-- different people or the same people with different personalities? -
Branton)

"I think these trips are to Groom Lake!

"The jets are still swarming over the Blue Diamond area. It's VERY odd. I
know in my heart that it's more than just practice flights!

"Something else very odd: (I think this might have something to do with the
tunnels). The apartment complex where I work (fourplexes - 450 of them)...
Two or three days ago the manager asked the maintenance men if any of them
were doing any work in ONE of the buildings. Everybody said no. She said
ALL 4 APARTMENTS in that building had called her and said that an explosion
knocked all the pictures off their walls and broke them. No one else, from
any other building felt anything. The man I said who saw the landing at
Holloman beat a path to me to tell me about this. ...A Las Vegas
subscriber."

In addition to this, here is another item which appeared in one of the NAR
newsletters: "On November 25th (1990), television station Channel 8 in Las
Vegas televised a two hour special on UFOs, Area 51, S-4 and the UFO
coverup. It is revealed that some of the people who contacted Channel 8 had
had their homes broken into in Las Vegas..." (could channel 8 have an
"infiltrator" working among them? - Branton)

Also, the following information appeared in the NAR Newsletter, under the
heading: "INTELLIGENCE REPORT" (also in reference to the UFO-Military
connection):

"NRO - National Recon Organization: Based at Fort Carson, Colorado.
Responsible for all alien or alien craft connected projects. Use unmarked
black helicopters.

"DELTA - Security teams from NRO specially trained to provide tasked
PROJECTS/LUNA security (MEN IN BLACK). This project is ongoing.

"BLUE TEAM - The first project responsible for reaction/ recovery of
downed/crashed alien craft and/or aliens. This was an AF Material Command
project.

"UFO sightings of craft accompanied by black helicopters are REDLIGHT
assets that originate at Groom Lake (Dreamland), Area 51 north of Las
Vegas.

"...PROJECTS: BLUE TEAM, SIGN, GRUDGE, AQUARIUS, SIGNA, PLUTO, SNOWBIRD,
LUNA, GABRIEL, EXCALIBUR (1988)... (Note: These are some of the 'secret
projects' allegedly relating to the U.S. Government's interaction with the
UFO phenomena. Further details on these projects are available from Leading
Edge Research., P.O. Box 481-MU58., Yelm, WA 98597. Although L.E.R. carries
much documentable information from very reliable sources, the reader should
be warned that they also carry some 'occult channeled' information which
may be of an extremely dubious nature, information that CANNOT be
physically substantiated. But the 'documentation' it does carry is
extensive and very well compiled - Branton).

The 'INTELLIGENCE REPORT' segment in NAR-LER also revealed the following
information concerning former Naval Officer Bill Cooper:

"Bill Cooper recently received some strange phone calls in which the
following statements were made by the caller:

"'I called to tell you that you are wrong about the alien base. LUNA is the
name of the base on the far side of the moon. The earth base is called
Dreamland.

"'You are in over your head. Would you like to end up in an asylum? If you
continue your activities you will meet me sooner than you think. You should
know who I am.'

"Bill Cooper has some comments. We will print them:

     "'When I released PUBLIC 02.DOC (release of info on computer
     bulletin board) my purpose was to expose the documents and
     information released by William Moore et al as being fraudulent
     and misleading. MAJESTIC TWELVE is an advisory team of scientists
     who's only purpose is to evaluate information and make
     recommendations. The information gathered by the control group
     MAJI is released to MAJESTIC TWELVE when study is needed.
     MAJESTIC TWELVE has never been the whole truth. MAJI is the
     MAJESTIC AGENCY FOR JOINT INTELLIGENCE and has total control of
     information and interface with the aliens in dealings with the
     United States government. Some of the documents released by Moore
     were changed from the original with the deliberate intent to
     mislead UFO researchers. I believe that the government is behind
     the whole thing. The rest of the documents are deliberate frauds.
     MAJIC is the highest security classification in the nation...'"
     (Other 'Above Top Secret' security classifications reportedly
     include the "Q", "E", "MJ" and "ULTRA" classifications - Branton)

The following information from William F. Hamilton III appeared in "UFO
UNIVERSE" and describes further details on the 'Yellow Fruit' account,
including claims which YF made over the air during the few 'interviews' in
which he took part on KVEG Radio's Billy Goodman talk show:

     "...Yellow Fruit revealed that A CONFLICT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN
     THE BENEVOLENT ONES and THE EBE's and that now the benevolent
     ones had gained the upper hand at Dreamland where he said a
     contingent of 37 benevolent ones were stationed and where 3 EBE's
     were held in captivity.

     "Bizarre! Science Fiction? Yellow Fruit knew a lot about the test
     site area. I resolved to go to the location he gave of the EBE
     installation in Deep Springs, California and then on to visit Pat
     at the Rachel Bar & Grill to make contact with Yellow Fruit (the
     name for the first level of security force at Area 51 and also
     the name of an old Army-CIA unit). The second level of security
     he called 'Sea Spray' and intimated that you would have an
     encounter of the unpleasant kind if you ever met with them.

     "Callers to the Billy Goodman Radio Happening had already
     organized trips to mile-marker 29 1/2 on highway 375 where a dirt
     road left the highway to intersect the road to Dreamland. There
     was a heavy black mail box on this road which identified it. I
     got to Rachel early one October morning and left my card with Pat
     at Rachel's Bar and Grill to pass on to Yellow Fruit. She knew
     him by sight. I then inspected the dirt roads where people stood
     to observe the test flights. I had already interviewed four
     witnesses by phone who testified that they had seen UFOs over the
     Groom Mountains on certain nights in the same area they were seen
     by John Lear. I made a second trip to the area in late October
     where a public group visited Rachel and that is when I saw the
     mysterious Yellow Fruit in the cafe. He later called me on the
     phone. I left him with a copy of my book, 'Alien Magic' and he
     remarked on the research I had done concerning the search for
     underground bases.

     "According to Yellow Fruit and others there are underground bases
     and tunnels that conceal the activities of the aliens and secret
     government projects..."

The following is an excerpt from an article which appeared in a UFO-related
publication. We do not know exactly who the author of the article is, but
we relate the excerpt as it was sent to us:

"...Lear directed my attention to a large map of Nevada, which delineates
all the areas which civilian maps coyly leave as uncharted military
preserves. 'Right in the very center is a place called Area 51. It is our
most secret complex. There are 1900 people there -- it takes presidential
clearance to work there -- and they're ferried in by aircraft in the
morning and taken out about 5 o'clock in the evening. They have nothing to
do with the saucers. The people who work on the saucers go up later in the
afternoon, and go home about midnight. The saucer facility is called S-4.'
S-4 is in the southwest corner of Area 51.

"Unfortunately, this facility -- and a similar set-up near Dulce, New
Mexico -- may now belong to forces not loyal to the U.S. Government, or
even the human race. 'It's horrifying for us to think that all the
scientists we think are working for us are actually controlled by the
aliens.'

"Here, Lear seems to contradict himself. He speaks of 'aliens,' plural, in
a controlling capacity, whereas previously he noted but one survivor, kept
as captive. He resolves this conflict by describing an alleged landing at
Holloman Air Force Base on April 24, 1964 -- our first 'diplomatic
contact,' as it were, with the visitors (Note: In addition, this writer
does not take into account the apparent SUBTERRANEAN connection and origin
of many of the 'alien' beings, which has been alleged by many sources and
which WOULD explain the large alien influence or presence in Nevada and
elsewhere - Branton). According to Lear and other sources, the 1973 Robert
Emenegger documentary 'UFOS: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE' presented a
thinly-fictionalized version of this event; government contacts allegedly
provided the film-makers actual footage of the meeting, which, alas, was
withdrawn at the last moment for as-yet un-specified reasons.

"'A deal was made with them in the latter part of the 1960s (Note: As we've
indicated earlier, this might have been a 'revisioning' of an earlier
treaty, as certain sources claim that these treaties go back to the 1930's,
if not earlier. Some of those involved in this 'deal' may have had good
intentions, since the Grays presented themselves as evolved 'space
brothers' who only wanted to help us. John Lear even alleged that huge
underground bases were constructed with the 'help' of the Grays, yet when
completed, the Grays did an about face and took control of not only the
lower levels of these bases but also the mechanisms which were supposedly
given to the government as part of the 'deal'. This is about the time that
the 'wars' began within the subterranean system itself, near the time when
the so- called 'Grand Deception' of the aliens was discovered - Branton).

"'In exchange for technology, we would cover up the existence of the
aliens.' Apparently this agreement -- engineered by an arm of government so
covert that even the President may not be on the 'need to know' list --
also sanctioned the abduction of humans, which the aliens rationalized as
an ongoing monitoring of a developing civilization. We asked only for a
list of the abductees.

"In 1973, the deal soured. 'Hundreds of people -- thousands -- were being
abducted that weren't on the list. In 1978-79, there was an altercation
between us and the aliens, in which they killed 44 of our top scientists,
and a number of Delta forces who were trying to free them. I'm not sure
where this altercation occurred -- it could have been Dulce (probably
Dulce, as the term 'Dulce Wars' -- which has been referred to by different
sources -- would seem to indicate. Also, there is some confusion as to the
"66" and "44" numbers. Paul Bennewitz says that 66 Special Forces were
killed in an attempt to set free some of our scientists from the "aliens"
that had taken them captive, whereas 44 escaped. Whether the 44 were
storm-troopers or scientists is uncertain, although most sources state that
the scientist did NOT make it out alive. Bennewitz claims that the "44" did
not die but escaped instead. Since some report that the scientists were NOT
set free it may have been that 100 special forces were sent in -- 66 of
them being killed in the attempt and 44 escaping the alien counter-attack -
Branton), or it could have occurred in Groom Lake (Robert Lazar has stated
that a similar confrontation between the aliens and human Security DID
occur in the bases below Groom Lake - Branton.) This battle, Lear claims,
left us bereft of our own facilities; ever since, we have attempted to
create a counterforce to meet the alien challenge." (In other words, the
'aliens' invaded and took control of the underground bases -- probably from
BELOW -- and killed many of the TOP SCIENTISTS in America, destroying much
of 'our' ability to defend ourselves, at least technically, from their
ongoing incursions - Branton)

"...The Strategic Defense Initiative was one such scheme. 'SDI, regardless
of what you hear, was completed two years ago; that was to shoot down
incoming saucers. The mistake was that we thought they were coming inbound
- in fact, they're already here. They're in underground bases all over the
place.' It seems that the aliens had constructed many such bases without
our knowledge, where they conduct heinous genetic experiments on animals,
human beings, and 'improvised' creatures of their own devising.'"

The following information was released by Leading Edge Research and
describes some additional details concerning the serpent race/greys based
upon the findings of several researchers who have pooled their
investigations in order to find out more about this apparent enemy or
nemesis to humankind. The following scenario emerged from this cooperative
effort (emphasis ours - Branton):

"NOTES ON ALF (Alien Life Forms): Term used by the government to describe
the Greys in terms of being a MALEVOLENT life form. The deal with the Greys
is that their field around their body is different (from) ours to the point
where merging of the fields ends up creating physical symptoms (the 'body
terror' mentioned by people like Whitley Strieber). The field around them
is in direct opposition to ours. IT IS AN ANTI- LIFE FIELD... THEY ARE
EXPERTS OF MANIPULATION OF BOTH THE HUMAN BODY (THROUGH MANIPULATION OF THE
FIELDS) AND THE HUMAN MIND. THEY REQUIRE BLOOD AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS
to survive. THEY ABDUCT HUMANS AND ANIMALS IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THESE FLUIDS
(VAMPIRIAL in nature - Branton). They implant small devices in the brain
which potentially GIVES THEM TOTAL CONTROL AND MONITORING CAPABILITY. These
devices are very difficult to detect. The analysis of the devices by
technical staff has produced a description that involves use of crystalline
technology combined with molecular circuitry and these ride on the resonant
emissions of the brain and the various fields of the human (body).
Information is entrained on the brain waves. It appears that all attempts
to remove the implants (1972) have resulted in the death of the human. They
perform surgery and other operations on human subjects. These abductions
continue to be an ongoing matter. A list of abductees is provided
periodically to MAJI, although IT IS KNOWN THAT MANY MORE ARE ABDUCTED THAN
ARE REPORTED... Various descriptions of the ALF's relate the following
characteristics: Between 3 to 5 feet in height, erect standing biped, small
thin build, head larger than humans, absence of auditory lobes (external),
absence of body hair, large... eyes (slanted approximately 35 degrees)
WHICH ARE OPAQUE BLACK WITH VERTICAL SLIT PUPILS, ARMS RESEMBLING PRAYING
MANTIS (normal attitude) which reach to the knees, long hands with small
palm, CLAW-LIKE FINGERS (various number of digits - often two short digits
and two long, but some species have three or four fingers), tough gray skin
WHICH IS REPTILIAN IN TEXTURE, small feet WITH FOUR SMALL CLAW-LIKE TOES...
a non-functioning digestive system; TWO SEPARATE BRAINS; movement is
deliberate, slow and precise; ALIEN SUBSTANCE REQUIRES THAT THEY MUST HAVE
HUMAN BLOOD AND OTHER BIOLOGICAL SUB- STANCES to survive. In extreme
circumstances they can subsist on other (cattle, etc.) animal fluids. Food
is converted to energy by Chlorophyll, by a photosynthetic process (this
supports results gained from autopsies at 29 Palms underground base where
it was seen that their 'blood' was greenish and the tissue was black).
Waste products are secreted through the skin. The two separate brains are
separated by mid-cranial lateral bone (anterior and posterior brain). There
is no apparent connection between the two (could one be an 'individual'
brain while the other works as part of a 'collective consciousness'? -
Branton). Some autopsies have revealed a crystalline network which is
thought to have a function in telepathic (and other) functions which help
to maintain the group consciousness between members of the same species.
Functions of group consciousness in this species does have a disadvantage
in that decisions in this species comes rather slowly as the matter at hand
filters through the group awareness of those who must make the decision..."

The above description fits almost perfectly with the description of the
'UFO occupants' witnessed by police officer/patrolman Herb Shermer. Shermer
described these creatures which he swore he encountered outside of Ashland,
Nebraska, shortly after midnight on December 3rd, 1967:

"...They were from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet tall. Their uniforms were
silver-gray, very shiny. Their suits came up around their heads like a
pilot's cap. On the right side of their helmet's they had a small antenna,
just above where the ear would be. Their chests were bigger than ours, they
were built very wiry and muscular. Their eyes were the one thing I will
never forget... THE PUPIL WENT UP AND DOWN LIKE A SLIT. When they looked at
me they stared straight into my eyes. They didn't blink. It was REAL
uncomfortable. Their noses were flat, their mouths looked more like a slit
than a regular mouth..."

The fact that the pupils of the creatures encountered by Shermer were
'slit-like' would indicate that the creatures were most likely
reptilian-saurian in nature, as most snakes and lizards, etc., have
vertical-slit pupils. The reptilian connection which we make with the
creatures encountered by officer Shermer is not based solely on his
testimony alone, but on the other testimonies of various persons who have
also encountered creatures similar to the ones just described. Many of
these accounts give a more definite link -- between the ancient
reptilian-saurian race which disappeared from the surface of this planet
ages ago -- and the non-human UFOnauts encountered by literally tens of
thousands of individuals the world over.

QUEST INTERNATIONAL (c/o 15, Pichard Court., Temple Newsam., Leeds, L515
9AY., ENGLAND U.K.), a major British UFO research organization consisting
mainly of retired Police, Security and Military personnel, is presently
investigating what may well be the most documentable case of the
crash-retrieval of an unidentified flying disk to date.

On the 7th of May, 1989, NORAD installations allegedly tracked an
unidentified object as it entered African air-space. The South African Air
Force is also said to have tracked the craft by radar, traveling at a
calculated speed of 5746 nautical miles per hour. The incident was related
by a South African Intelligence Worker, who along with documentation of his
military position, also sent secret files and transcripts to two QUEST
INTERNATIONAL investigators, Tony Dodd and Henry Azadehdel, telling of the
event. Also, several RECORDED telephone conversations with high-ranking
military and government officials were obtained which strongly suggest that
'something' did in fact happen over South African terrain. Some of these
recorded conversations involved military officials in South Africa who
strongly reprimand the intelligence-worker-turned-informer over the phone.
This was due to the fact that the informer had left South Africa for
Britain, where he stayed at the house of the researchers, and then later
went into hiding.

QUEST INTERNATIONAL director Graham W. Birdsall has stated that the
documentation and the individuals involved in the incident are of such a
nature that the event must have taken place, or the International
Intelligence Community is collectively perpetrating a hoax of incredible
magnitude concerning a crashed and recovered flying disk. Birdsall strongly
suspects that the incidents did take place, due to the weight of evidence.
Following is part of a word-for-word transcript given to the researchers by
the informant, which he alleged was taken from the actual top secret report
of the initial tracking of the object:

"...The object entered South African air space at 13.52 GMT. Radio contact
was attempted with object, but all communications proved futile. As a
result two armed Mirage fighters were scrambled. A short time later the
object suddenly changed course at great speed which would have been
impossible for conventional aircraft to duplicate.

"At 13.59 GMT, Squadron Leader ----- the pilot of the fighter reported that
they had radar and visual confirmation of the object. The order was given
to arm and fire the experimental aircraft- mounted Thor 2 laser cannon.
This was done.

"Squadron leader ----- reported that several blinding flashes emitted from
the object which had started wavering whilst heading in a northerly
direction. At 14.02 it was reported that the object was decreasing altitude
at a rate of 3000 feet per minute. Then at speed it dived at an angle of 25
degrees and impacted in desert terrain 80 miles north of the South African
border with Botswana, identified as the central Kalahari desert. Squadron
leader ----- was instructed to circle the area until a retrieval team
arrived. A team of Air Force Intelligence Officers, together with medical
and technical staff were promptly taken to the area of impact for
Investigation and retrieval. The findings were as follows:

1) a crater 150 meters in diameter and 12 meters in depth.
2) A silver coloured disk shaped object 45 degrees embedded inside of
crater.
3) Around the object sand and rocks were fused together by the intense
heat.
4) An intense magnetic and radio-active environment around the object
resulted in electronic failure of air force equipment (causing the crash of
one Air Force helicopter).
5) The object was eventually moved to an Air Force Base for further
investigation.
6) The terrain of impact was filled with sand and rubble to disguise all
evidence of the event having taken place..."

The report indicated that a hydraulic type landing gear was fully deployed,
suggesting that electronic malfunction had caused the object to crash,
probably due to the Thor 2 laser cannon having been fired at the craft.
While the team observed the object at the Air Force Base a loud sound was
heard. It was then noted that a hatch on the lower side of the craft had
opened slightly and appeared to be stuck. This opening was later forced
with the use of hydraulic pressure equipment, at which point two humanoid
entities in tight fitting grey suits emerged and were promptly apprehended.
The report stated that the entities were of the following description
(emphasis ours - Branton):

"HEIGHT: 4-5.5 ft.; COMPLEXION: Greyish blue - skin texture smooth,
extremely resilient; HAIR: Totally devoid of any bodily hair; HEAD:
Oversize in relation to human proportions. Raised cranium with dark blue
markings around head; FACE: Prominent cheek bones; EYES: Large and slanted
upwards towards side of face. NO pupils seen; NOSE: Small consisting of two
nostrils; MOUTH: Small slit devoid of lips; JAW: Small in relation to human
proportions; BODY/ARMS: Long and thin reaching just above knees; HANDS:
CONSISTING OF 3 DIGITS, WEBBED, CLAW-LIKE NAILS; TORSO: CHEST AND ABDOMEN
COVERED WITH SCALY RIBBED SKIN; HIPS: Small narrow; LEGS: Short and thin;
GENITALS: NO EXTERIOR sexual organs; FEET: CONSISTING OF THREE TOES, NO
NAILS AND WEBBED. NOTES: Due to AGGRESSIVE NATURE of humanoids, no samples
of blood or tissue could be taken (One humanoid ATTACKED DOCTOR causing
DEEP SCRATCHES ON FACE AND CHEST). When offered various food, refused to
eat... One way passage has been requested for both humanoids to Wright
Patterson Air Force Base USA for more advanced investigation and
research..."

Many of the details regarding these 'humanoids' are actually very similar
to other branches of the reptilian race as it has been described by other
witnesses. It appears as if the 'serpent race' is composed of several
different branches or types, much the same as dogs and other animals retain
their distinction but are composed of several different 'types' or
'branches'. Commonly known reptiles are devoid of bodily hair, have
prominent cheek bones, large slanted eyes, small openings in place of ears,
3-digit webbed hands and feet -- except in the case of snakes, etc., which
lost use of their limbs through atrophication over 1000's of years, -- have
claws, are covered with 'scaly' ribbed skin, and have no external
reproductive organs, being egg-layers, and are aggressive and predatory in
nature.

The top-secret document indicated that the passage of the object and
creatures would be implemented on the 23rd of June, 1989 to Wright
Patterson AFB. Actually, sources DO indicate that Wright Patterson DID IN
FACT GO ON RED ALERT on that date. Subsequent documents supplied by the
Intelligence source to QUEST INTERNATIONAL indicate that the creatures
seemed to have a strong connection with the SAURIAN race which existed in
ancient times. The exact wording of one particular document which is now in
the hands of QUEST INTERNATIONAL is as follows:

"All informations found aboard alien spacecraft concerning the evolution of
alien life forms indicates to an evolution similar to that which we find on
Earth PRIOR TO THE EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS... (the findings indicate) a
high degree of ADAPTABILITY. Further physiological and psychological
studies performed in South Africa and in the United States points to a
simple and complex structure of behavior. It would seem as if these
lifeforms CAN NOT FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT GROUP INTELLIGENCE AND
IDENTITY TOGETHER WITH A CENTRAL COMMAND. According to additional
informations found aboard retrieved craft a separate race is designated
superior by them. CONCLUSION: An in-depth study and analysis of the
psychological make-up and behavior prediction is advised. Studies performed
on two alien life forms captured has proven that they cannot act
independently from own acquired intelligence without access to
communication, orders and instructions from a hierarchy or central
command..."

Three different aspects of the South African affair in fact coincide very
closely with what other sources have revealed concerning these
reptilian-saurian or 'alien' creatures:

1) Numerous sources indicate that the saurioid 'grays' are the lower
echelon of a hidden reptilian hierarchy, and that the other race which is
considered to be superior is saurian-reptilian and hominoid as well,
although they are a different and larger 'branch' of the serpent race. They
resemble "lizard men" of a somewhat similar appearance to the RAPTORS
depicted in the movie JURASSIC PARK, yet of a more hominoid mutation or
appearance than those depicted in the movie;

2) Many other sources state that the serpent race, saurians or reptilians
operate on a 'collective consciousness' level as if the individual alien
beings are -- to put it in one perspective -- individual 'cells' in an
immense mind or body of a single immense creature. Actually there seems to
be a COMBINATION of both individuality AS WELL AS 'collective
consciousness' operating in these entities;

3) The description of the 'aliens' as well as the electromagnetic nature of
their craft corresponds exactly with descriptions given in THOUSANDS of
separate reports of this nature.

The Intelligence Officer who contacted QUEST INTER- NATIONAL and provided
them with the information, claims he did so out of concern for the security
of the human race as a whole, and although he was pressured into signing a
'National Secrecy Act' form he believes that he would be guilty of treason
against the human race if he did not disclose what he knew, and what the
governments were trying to hide.

It is remarkable that the majority of the non-human occupants which are
reported in connection with these AERIAL craft are said to be REPTILIAN or
SAURIAN in nature, especially in light of uch prophecies as the one given
in Revelation chapter 12, which reads:

     "...And there was WAR IN HEAVEN: Michael fought against THE
     DRAGON; and THE DRAGON fought and his angels... and the GREAT
     DRAGON was cast out, that OLD SERPENT, called the Devil, and
     Satan, which DECIEVETH the whole world..."

One of the 'phenomena' which we have mentioned earlier has taken place in
several different parts of the world, but most prominently along the
Continental Divide region of the U.S.

Since the late 1960's, bizarre animal (especially cattle) mutilations have
been on the increase. Numerous accounts claim that these mutilations were
performed with laser-fine surgical precision, with cuts so precise (down to
the separation of the molecules themselves) that they could not have been
accomplished by the conventionally known technology of the time. Eyes,
colons, reproductive organs, etc., are very often reported as having been
removed in such a manner as if part of a rehearsed process being carried
out in widely scattered locations. The blood is almost always described as
having been drained with no resulting vascular collapse (also impossible
with the conventional technology of our society at the time). In most cases
no tracks or markings in the ground have been discovered, which is another
mystery that investigators for a large part have been unable to explain;
but in the few cases where markings have been seen, the investigators
consistently report the existence of strange 'tripod' or 'crop-circle'
marks in the ground, nothing else. Another strange phenomena surrounding
these mutilations is the fact that predatory birds and other animals which
have fed off the carcasses of the mutilated animals have often been found
lying dead nearby. It is even reported that in some cases maggots have
refuse to touch such carcasses. Again, the reason is unknown. Just who or
what is mutilating these animals? The "Mutilation" phenomena was at its
height from the mid-1970's to the late 1980's. In the mid-1990's the
mutilations seem to have had a major resurgence, especially throughout the
Rocky Mountain states. In the Vol.5, No.4, 1990 issue of "UFO" Magazine
(pp.16-17), Linda Moulton Howe, in her article, "THE HARVEST CONTINUES:
ANIMAL MUTILATION UPDATE" made some very remarkable observations concerning
the mutilators themselves. She wrote:

     "In 1989, there were so many cattle mutilations in southern Idaho
     that Bear Lake County Sheriff Brent Bunn told me: 'We haven't
     seen anything like this since the 1970's.' Sheriff Bunn sent me
     16 neatly-typed 'Investigation Reports' about cattle mutilations
     that had taken place in his county between May and December. Over
     half occurred in a remote valley called Nounan. Only eighty
     people lived there. Ranching is their main income source, and
     cattle are precious. Disease and predators are old and
     well-understood enemies. What descended on Nounan, Idaho in the
     summer and fall of 1989 was not understood -- and it scared
     people.

     "'Bloodless cuts -- that's what bothers people,' officer Greg
     Athay wrote in his mutilation report,' There were no visible
     signs of the cause of death. It appeared that only the soft
     tissues (nose, lips and tongue) were gone off the head and four
     nipples off the bag. Again there was no blood on the hair and
     ground.'"

Howe described another incident which took place in this region during the
same time-period. This series of mutilations involved mostly cattle, over
half of which were young calves:

     "...One mutilated calf, found December 24 (1989), north of
     Downey, Idaho, was found lying on its back with the naval, rectum
     and genitals neatly cut out of the steer's white belly. No blood
     was found anywhere. The steer was taken for an autopsy to Dr.
     Chris Oats, D.V.M., at the Hawthorne Animal Hospital. Dr. Oats
     checked all the vital organs and was unable to determine the
     cause of death. During the autopsy, a sharp cut was found in the
     right chest area, and Dr. Oats also discovered that a main artery
     had been severed under the chest wound.

     "She was surprised that 'the steer had lost a large amount of
     blood, but (she) could not understand where it went to.' There
     was no blood on the steer or on the ground. Dr. Oats also
     determined that the steer had not been dragged by the neck or
     tied up around the feet."

Linda Howe also confirmed the fact that strange aerial disks have often
been reported in connection with the mutilations:

     "...Throughout the history of the animal mutilations, since 1967,
     there have been numerous eyewitness accounts of large, glowing
     disks or 'silent helicopters' over pastures where dead animals
     were later found. One Waco, Texas rancher said he encountered two
     four-foot tall, light green-colored 'creatures' with large,
     black, slanted eyes, carrying a calf which was later found dead
     and mutilated. In 1983, a Missouri couple watched through
     binoculars as two small beings in tight-fitting silver suits
     worked on a cow in a nearby pasture. The alien heads were large
     and white in color. Nearby, a tall, green-skinned 'lizard man'
     stood glaring with eyes slit by vertical pupils like a
     crocodiles..."

On Oct. 20, 1991, California researcher Michael Lindemann, founder of 'The
20/20 Group' (3463 State St., Suite 264., Santa Barbara, CA 93105), gave a
lecture before a large crowd of interested investigators which seems to
confirm much of the information which appears above. Mr. Lindemann began
his report by saying:

     "...How many of you saw the program on CBS Network on May 17th
     (1991) called 'ABDUCTION'? It was narrated by James Earl Jones.
     It was really quite a remarkable program, it took the subject of
     abduction absolutely seriously. This was prime time network, CBS.
     Of course FOX (network) has done a number of other programs and
     there have been some out standing UFO segments on 'UNSOLVED
     MYSTERIES'. But last night, maybe even a little more remarkable
     than the FOX 1-hour special, was what came on the news right
     after. Because in the Fox Network news program that followed in
     the 10 o'clock segment there was a hard news story about the
     allegation that the United States government is 'doing business'
     with greys. I have never seen anything like it... it was a very
     impressive indication of the way in which this subject is
     suddenly becoming O.K. to talk about. That says to me there has
     been a switch 'at the top'...

     "In our conversation today I use two terms... and the first of
     these terms is 'government'. We speak of the government as if it
     is a single thing. It is hardly that. It is actually a
     hodge-podge of...power-struggling people, but I would like to
     break it up into two main categories, and that is: 1) The
     government that we consider to be our duly constituted, our
     elected and appointed representatives who attempt as best they
     can to run a semblance of order or Federal government which
     follows the dictates of the constitution of the United States.
     The constitution is, after all, a darn good piece of paper, it is
     one of the best ever written... If only our government were
     capable of behaving in even...a resemblance of what is intended
     in the constitution, probably few of us would have a great deal
     to gripe about...

     "Now that they've failed to do that is not only because they are
     fallible humans, but also because they are undermined by another
     government.
