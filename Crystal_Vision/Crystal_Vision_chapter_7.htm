        We are now nearing the end of our

        conceptions, we should devote a little more time to matters less

        This little treatise, while giving as 
        wide a view as possible of the whole subject, aims to be intensely practical and 
        helpful to all who may read it. Some will be at one stage of 
        development, others will have reached a different level, but the author 
        trusts that all will obtain some hints that may actually be put into 
        practice, and thus lead the seeker to a clearer and better under<i>standing 
        of </i>himself and others.</p>

        A diet of fruit and vegetables may 
        have its advantages by making the student more susceptible to visions of 
        a clairvoyant type. On the other hand a mixed diet suits some people far 
        better, and may give more real staying power. Don’t become a &quot;diet
        crank&quot; you will have no time 
        for anything else more important. Use your common sense -- experiment if you like -- but 
        don’t form habits. The best type of man or woman is the one who can eat anything, and does eat anything according to the natural 
        promptings of his or her 
        being, and that without causing digestive troubles.</p>

        Drew, with wand, in front of me, a 
        circle (three times round) and formed astral in that. Rose to a great 
        height. Suddenly, as it were, a rope flashed round me and fell, forming 
        a spiral, ever widening, at the top of which I sat. Stood up on this, 
        only to fall, down, down, 
        down, not quite vertically, into the water. Rising again, and striking 
        out, I, after a short while 
        perceived a boat, something like a gondola, and swam towards it. It was 
        rowed by a dark-skinned man, old and wrinkled, whom I at first thought 
        to be an Indian. As I reached the boat and put my hand on the side, it 
        seemed as if he would strike at me with his oar, but no, he grinned, and 
        I drew myself into the boat and sat in the forepart, which was high and 
        covered with a sort of hood. Presently, it struck me that the man was 
        not living but dead (Death). We then drifted in a mist, and all became
        blank for awhile; the memory 
        of boat, man and self, <i>

        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;

        When the mist cleared I realized that 
        the man was no longer there, and I myself guided the boat. Coming back 
        out of the mist the waters were blue and no longer black, and I 
        realized, that day was breaking. Gradually I watched the Sunrise, and 
        set the boat in that direction, rowing so as to keep my face to the Sun. 
        It seemed like a Portal; but, keeping on, it presently rose, and by the 
        time it was getting high in the heavens I perceived a fair city ahead. 
        Domes, Minarets, etc. Arriving there, I for the first time noticed I was dark skinned and clad 
        in a loincloth. Landing, I was surrounded by men in an Eastern costume, Arabs or Turks, I thought them.</div>

        One old man took me by the hand, I 
        made the sign of the Pentagram over him, but he smiled and said &quot;Come along, 
        it’s all right,&quot; and led me along a street paved with cobbles, the houses of which 
        overhung, till we reached a sort of mosque.</p>

        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        Entering this, he led me to the 
        altar, which was supported by brackets from the wall, and above which 
        was a beautiful stained window. At the sides were thin columns and sort 
        of boxes, similar to theatre boxes. We knelt at the altar; and he took 
        my hand and said: &quot;Raise your consciousness.&quot; I perceived a star and 
        crescent above me, and a cross dimly formulated in the background.</p>

        After this, the astral seemed to 
        coincide with the body: but consciousness of the astral surroundings was 
        still clear. Continued to raise consciousness, and to send out thoughts of Love. Perceived around me 
        innumerable streams of thought, interlacing and like a net-work, and when the 
        Love-thought was sent out, the whole net sparkled, as with little specks 
        of gold. Continued in this thought for some minutes, and, gradually
        returned to normal. Gave 
        thanks and entered diary.&quot;</p>

        I quote this Vision, chiefly because 
        it was not what it should have been, and because this gives me the 
        opportunity of adding the Comments made upon it by my Guru. He wrote:</p>

        &quot;Very nearly in serious trouble, my 
        young and rash friend! It seems that you must go up well outside 
        earth-attraction if you wish to get good astrals. It sounds 
        Sunday-school talk, and I can give no reason. But I’ve tried repeatedly 
        going horizontally and downwards, always with the same result. Gross and 
        hostile things are below, pure being above. The vision is good enough 
        for what it is; it is clear and coherent. But I see no trace of 
        scientific method in directing the vision. I explain further in the general comment. O. M.&quot;</p>

        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        Such advice is worthy of the notice 
        of every &quot;seer&quot; for much of it applies to other forms of work. To search 
        the earth plane by means of visions, is practically valueless, and often 
        positively harmful. We can travel to another city for a few dollars 
        without expenditure of valuable occult power, but we have a right to use 
        it to examine &quot;Things above&quot; which cannot be reached by means of a 
        material aeroplane. We should always make use of physical means on the 
        physical plane if possible, people make the greatest mistakes by &quot;mixing the 
        planes.&quot; That is the chief trouble with &quot;mental science&quot; &quot;mental healing&quot; and what not. We 
        must learn to adjust things on their own <i>

        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;">planes. </span></i>
        The Physical by Physical, the Astral 
        by Astral, the Mental by Mental, and The Spiritual by Spiritual methods. 
        When we have straightened out these different levels of consciousness, a certain harmony will be apparent on all planes, which 
        in the end results in perfect 
        Unity. The Method of trying to control ideas of one plane, by means of 
        those of another, is a wrong one. Remember things are always true on 
        their own plane, but in very 
        few instances are they true on another. That is why we should examine 
        our visions scientifically, 
        while they are present in our consciousness, but when that consciousness 
        becomes aware of the material plane once more, we should place little, 
        if any reliance, on the truth 
        of our vision, as corresponding to events of everyday life.</div>

        other means. Few people realize that on the Astral Plane are the Records 
        from which such Inspired and Holy Books as Liber LXV are written, and that these Records may again be 
        Invoked by proper means.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 25.8pt; margin-left: 34.2pt; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &quot;March 24th, 1914. 9:40 to 10:50 P. 
        M.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &quot;During the day I prepared a Circle 
        of Orange, about 5 ft. in diameter (the largest I could make in the little 
        room I am using) and within it, an eight-pointed star of yellow. Within that again an Octagon. A Red upright Tau in the centre, 
        and eight small red 
        pentagrams at the points of the star to represent lights; for there was 
        no room to use them with 
        safety. The whole was very crude, but the best I could do with the 
        materials at hand.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &quot;Having robed and entered the temple, 
        I made a general Invocation (impromptu) of the Lord of the Universe, and 
        traced the circle and figures with the wand. Performed the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram; then Invoked &quot;Water&quot; and 
        sprinkled the circle to purify it. Performed the Lesser Ritual of the 
        Hexagon, followed by Invocation of Mercury and Hod, (impromptu) with appropriate Hexagram.</p>

        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        Lit incense. Made a further statement 
        of my intention. Knelt in the centre of Circle and tried to formulate a 
        &quot;White Astral&quot; with no very great success at first. Afterwards, I forgot about the 
        material body and began to get some result.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        Found my &quot;astral&quot; floating upon a 
        dark sea on a sort of plank. The moon was shining above, and the thought 
        came to me that ’perhaps the Moon represented the Unicorn I had set out to seek’, but I 
        decided it was not so.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        Rising higher, I tried to identify 
        myself with the moon, and then turned and faced the Sun; looking along 
        the Ray as a Path. I had the impression of being a little child.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        About this time I was reminded of my 
        physical body by a pressure on the brain, head and neck; a sort of 
        frozen rigidity, which caused me to lose concentration on the astral for 
        a little while. I determined to keep on, however, and astrally performed 
        the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. When I came to the words: 
        &quot;In the column stands the 
        Six-Rayed Star&quot; I seemed to rise quite easily.</div>

        Traveled about, with no particular 
        visions, seeking the Unicorn. I obtained an idea of a unicorn, but not 
        very distinctly, and spoke to it. It informed me that it had no desire 
        to converse. I made the sign of the Pentagram over it, whereupon, it 
        said that it was not that 
        which I sought. This being my own opinion also, I left it, and rose 
        higher to try again.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 34.2pt; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        This time I got a clearer idea of 
        the Unicorn, and began to converse with it.</p>

        We were on the edge of a wood, 
        beneath a night sky. It told me to look up, and having done so, I 
        perceived a <i>
        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;">comet </span></i>

        flash across the sky and disappear. 
        Turning back, I questioned 
        him, and he answered; ’All men are thus, the Universe is thus’. So I 
        gathered from his words that a 
        fragment appears for a moment (or a period) and disappears, leaving no 
        trace.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        I felt that this was something I must 
        get to understand, when he said: ’Look again’ and this time a <i>
        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;">meteor </span></i>
        flashed and then struck the earth. 
        And he said: ’Sometimes it is 
        thus, and there appears to be pain as a result’. Then I said to him: ’Do 
        I understand that man appears 
        for a moment only, and is forever gone again?’ And he answered ’The
        comet remains travelling in 
        its ellipse, and only disappears from sight. Further, he told me to look 
        again, and I beheld a <i>

        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;">fixed star, </span>
        </i>shining in the blue. Turning 
        again to him, I asked what 
        this meant; and he answered: ’The Masters are thus, they travel no more, 
        but give Light’. Then I asked if I should attain to this, to which he replied 
        ’Yea, but not yet. Thou must 
        be as a comet until after a while thou strikest, a star, and becoming 
        one with it, remain fixed.’</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 32.4pt; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        And I understood that there was 
        nothing further to be said at that time. So I returned, and having given thanks, 
        entered these experiences in my diary.&quot;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

        There is not much further to be said, 
        so far as this little book is concerned, though there is much that 
        might, and will be said at the proper time. The early vision, above recorded, took place 8 years 
        ago, and much has transpired since then.</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        It may be remarked that this vision 
        had a far wider and deeper application than ever the Seer realized at 
        the time, part of this became more apparent many years later, there is 
        still much to be accomplished.</p>

        <p class="Style2" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        But let me call your attention to the 
        Star. It is written, in Liber Legis, The Book of the Law, &quot;Every man and 
        every woman is a star.&quot; What does this mean? It would take another and longer treatise, to 
        tell you. This much may be said, however:</p>

        At the CENTRE of our Being is the 
        Star of Unconquered Will, that is the True or Divine Will, the Will of 
        the Universe. Each must discover this Star in his own being, and putting 
        his personal will in line with Its Guidance, become an active and 
        conscious cooperator in the Universal Plan. This Star is of Intense 
        brilliance. It is the Diamond Soul, the only Veil about the Innermost 
        Essential Self. It is thus the ULTIMATE CRYSTAL, of which it is written 
        by Our Lady Nuit -- Goddess of the Starry Heavens -­Who 
        represents INFINITE SPACE or the Universal Crystalline Sphere:</div>
