<p align="center"><b>THE ATTAINMENT OF CRYSTAL VISION</b></p>

<p>The reader will by now have realized that there is a certain
difference between Visions obtained by means of the Crystal, and
the attainment of Crystal Vision.</p>

<p>Let us consider the matter in greater detail. If we use a
crystal as a means of obtaining visions of what, to us, would
otherwise remain unseen, we accomplish our purpose through
learning to <i>concentrate our attention </i>on the Lesser
Crystalline Sphere. Just what we see by<i> </i>this means is
beyond our power of control, for we have taken no steps to insure
any particular type of vision appearing before us in the crystal.
The visions so obtained may be pleasant, or unpleasant;
symbolical or actual; past, present, or future; and we have to
rely upon our own power of comprehension and our own intuitive
ideas, in order to make such visions of value.</p>

<p>Also, the power to see such visions at all, largely depends on
our own inner state of development. If we have not been living on
the right diet, if we have not learned to breathe correctly, if
our own ideas are not of the greatest purity; these visions may
be coloured by our own thought, or we may not be able to get
beyond the very early stages.</p>

<p>Much therefore depends upon ourselves, and we must be prepared
to so train ourselves that these &quot;inner powers&quot;, which
enable us to contact the subtle vibrations concentrated on the
crystal from the Universal Sphere, may become apparent to our
conscious mind.</p>

<p><i>The concentration of </i>our gaze on the crystal is Perhaps
the most important part of the whole operation, for we are thus
learning to <i>concentrate our minds </i>on a single idea.</p>

<p>Concentration of mind leads to the highest results, if rightly
directed. It is a valuable acquirement and well worth the time
and trouble it may take in order to secure it.</p>

<p>The true Student will probably realize that this power of
mental concentration is of greater importance than the mere
elementary visions seen in the crystal while we are learning to
acquire it., The practices we have undertaken to that end will
have served to strengthen the will and with that strengthening of
the will comes more power of choice. We are no longer content to
remain slaves to our visions (or to our thoughts) we seek a
conscious mastery over these things.</p>

<p>In that case, we may begin to question the truth of our
visions. We may find ourselves in a position to see certain
events which have transpired, or are transpiring, or will
transpire on this material plane. We may follow our <i>inner
guidance </i>when we interpret these visions, and we may make a
true guess, so that what we have beheld may prove in line with
fact. On the other hand, we may find many instances when our
interpretation of the Symbols, or the Time, connected with our
visions is far from correct. Many people forget about these
things, and we only hear of the few instances when everything
turns out correctly.</p>

<p>Some persons seem naturally gifted with &quot;second
sight&quot; and are able to give others an accurate
&quot;reading&quot; in a fairly large percentage of cases. But
such persons are comparatively rare, and in any case they
represent the &quot;mediumistic&quot; passive type of
individuals, who are little better than reflectors, with no
creative powers of their own.</p>

<p>Crystal gazing, should teach us to become more positive,
rather than more negative. Our only chance of true advancement
lies in the direction <i>of control </i>of the Astral Plane. If
we let it control us, we are lost. </p>

<p>The Ancients, realizing this, devised the proper methods for
obtaining visions <i>of a definite type, </i>or at least from a <i>definite
type of intelligence, </i>represented -- in the examples
previously given -- by certain Angels of a high order. Such
Beings are capable of teaching us great truths, while the mere
elementals, with which we may come in contact by less scientific
methods, are only too likely to lead us astray.</p>

<p>But we also discovered that in order to carry out the
instructions of the Wise Seers of the past, we must first be in
possession of a fund of knowledge which would put us in the
position to work in an intelligent manner. Should we, on the
other hand neglect to obtain this, we should still be just as
much at the mercy of the elementary forces, since in our
ignorance, we could be easily deceived, and having no means of
testing the accuracy of our results, might well come to grief.</p>

<p>Our safest method, therefore, will be to treat every result as

<i>subjective, </i>as something arising within ourselves, and to
leave on one side the question of the <i>objective reality of </i>any
of our visions. Just because we perceive a &quot;vision&quot;
which appears to be in objective space, because we have our
physical eyes open and have been gazing at a Crystal, it does not
prove that this vision is really outside of us. As a matter of
fact all we perceive in the physical universe, is <i>within </i>our
organ of vision, and the outside cause may be quite other than
that which we think it is. A table, for instance, appears as it
does on account of certain vibrations from the
&quot;outside&quot; entering our consciousness through the
&quot;eye&quot; and our inner organ of vision reacts, and
projects into &quot;space&quot; the image that we call a

&quot;table&quot;. Just what a &quot;table&quot; is in reality,
we really do not know.</p>

<p>In any case, when we have been gazing at the crystal, after
the mist has cleared away and we become conscious of the
&quot;vision&quot;, we are not at the same time conscious of our
material surroundings.</p>

<p>So we see, that after all, our own &quot;vision&quot; needs to
be trained, and that is the most important consideration for the
true Seer.</p>

<p>Now, although it is not so easy perhaps, we are just as well
able -- with practice-- to concentrate our minds <i>inwards </i>as
<i>outwards. </i>We can make a <i>mental picture </i>of a crystal
or some other simple object, and concentrate on that <i>mental
image </i>while our physical eyes are closed. We have, in other
words a certain power of <i>inner vision </i>which may be much
developed. Once we have learned to concentrate the mind to some
extent, we may arouse, by means of our <i>creative imagination </i>any
kind of vision we desire. But again we cannot be sure that we <i>imagine
truly, </i>this, however, need not concern us very much for the
moment.</p>

<p>If we try to imagine, for instance, a &quot;Red Triangle&quot;
we find our mental picture, even of this simple object, trying to
escape us. It will change colour, and shape, and size; and at
first it is very little under our control. But it is slightly
under our control because we created it by means of our will <i>to
perceive a red triangle. </i>It is quite unlike an idea which <i>takes
possession of our mind </i>against our will, and obsesses us.
Also, the more we practice, the more vividly shall we be able to
see the Red Triangle, and the less it will change colour and
shape, till one day after we have been practicing a long time,
perhaps -- we shall be able to <i>hold it before our mental
vision at </i>will. The fact that we are able to do this, will
imply that we have been able to <i>cut away from consciousness </i>every
other thought except the Red Triangle. What will be the result?
There will be a &quot;rushing together of the Seer and the
Seen&quot; and in a moment we shall find ourselves in an <i>entirely
new state of consciousness. </i>Our mind -- for a brief period at
any rate -- will become CRYSTAL CLEAR. We shall have obtained,
what in Raja Yoga is called, Dhyana. This is but the first of the
Great results, but it is a thousand times more glorious, and more
worth while, than any vision in <i>the crystal </i>that might
have been obtained by concentration of the mind <i>outside </i>instead
of inside our own Crystalline Sphere.</p>

<p>Again, man has the power -- once he has learned to concentrate
-- to form for himself a &quot;Body of Light&quot; or
&quot;Astral Body&quot; which at first surrounds his physical
body, and may afterwards be separated from it, so that -- while
still retaining his full consciousness -- he may learn to <i>travel
</i>clothed in his Body of Light, on the Astral Plane. He may
visit other spheres, those depicted in the Diagram as surrounding
the physical world, governed by the planetary intelligences. He
may extend his field of knowledge further and further, until some
day, if he has succeeded in purifying himself sufficiently in the
meanwhile, he may gaze upon that UNIVERSAL CRYSTALLINE SPHERE,
mentioned in our Third Chapter.</p>

<p>It was such a course that Frater 0. M. took when he obtained
the series of 30 Visions of the Aires or Athyrs, in accordance
with the System partially worked out by Dr. Dee and Sir Edward
Kelly. Some of these visions are very wonderful indeed, and I
cannot refrain from quoting a part of his Magical Record on the
subject. The following is chosen because it introduces the Angel
Madimi, the same who first appeared to Dr. Dee.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE CRY OF THE 17TH AETHYR WHICH IS CALLED
TAN.</b></p>

<p>&quot;Into the <b><i>stone </i></b>there first cometh the head
of a dragon, and then the Angel Madimi. She is not the mere
elemental that one would suppose from the account of Casaubon. I
enquire why her form is different.</p>

<p>She says: Since all things are God, in all things thou seest
just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth thee. But behold!
Thou must pierce deeply into this Aethyr before true images
appear. For TAN is that which transformeth judgment into justice.
BAL is the sword, and TAN the balances.</p>

<p>A pair of balances appears in the stone, and on the bar of the
balance is written: Motion about a point is iniquity.</p>

<p>And behind the balances is a plume, luminous, azure. And
somehow connected with the plume, but I cannot divine how, are
the words: Breath is iniquity. (That is, any wind must stir the
feather of truth.)</p>

<p>And behind the plume is a shining filament of quartz,
suspended vertically from the abyss to the abyss. And in the
midst is a winged disk of some extremely delicate, translucent
substance, on which is written in the &quot;dagger&quot;
alphabet: Torsion is iniquity. (This means, that Rashith
Ha-Gilgalim is the first appearance of evil.)</p>

<p>And now an Angel appears, like as he were carven in black
diamonds. And he cries: Woe unto the Second, whom all nations of
men call the First. Woe unto the First, whom all grades of Adepts
call the First. Woe unto me, for I, even as they, have worshipped
him. But she whose paps are the galaxies, and he that never shall
be known, in them is no motion. For the Infinite Without filleth
all and moveth not, and the Infinite Within goeth indeed; but it
is no odds, else were the space-marks confounded.</p>

<p>And now the Angel is but a shining speck of blackness in the
midst of a tremendous sphere of liquid and vibrating light, at
first gold, then becoming green, and lastly pure gold. And I see
that the green of Libra is made up of the yellow of air and the
blue of water, swords and cups, judgment and mercy. And this word
TAN meaneth mercy. And the feather of Maat is blue because the
truth of justice is mercy. And a voice cometh, as it were the
music of the ripples of the surface of the sphere: Truth is
delight. (This means that the Truth of the universe is delight.)</p>

<p>Another voice cometh; it is the voice of a mighty Angel, all
in silver; the scales of his armour and the plumes of his wings
are like mother-of-pearl in a framework of silver. And he sayeth:
Justice is the equity that ye have made for yourselves between
truth and falsehood. But in Truth there is nothing of this, for
there is only Truth. Your falsehood is but a little falser than
your truth. Yet by your truth shall ye come to Truth. Your truth
is your troth with Adonai the Beloved one. And the Chymical
Marriage of the Alchemists beginneth with a Weighing, and he that
is not found wanting hath within him one spark of fire, so dense
and so intense that it cannot be moved, though all the winds of
heaven should clamour against it, and all the waters of the abyss
surge upon it to smother it. Nay, it shall not be moved.</p>

<p>And this is the fire of which it is written: &quot;Hear thou
the voice of fire I&quot; And the voice of Afire is the second
chapter of the Book of the Law, that is revealed unto him that is
a score and half a score and three that are scores, and six, by
Aiwass, that is his guardian, the mighty Angel that extendeth
from the first unto the last, and maketh known the mysteries that
are beyond. And the method and the form of invocation whereby a
man shall attain to the knowledge and conversation of his Holy
Guardian Angel shall be given unto thee in the proper place, and
seeing that the word is deadlier than lightning, do thou meditate
straightly thereupon, solitary, in a place where is no living
thing visible, but only the light of the sun. And thy head shall
be bare. Thus mayest thou become fitted to receive this, the
holiest of the Mysteries. And it is the holiest of the Mysteries
because it is the Next Step. And those Mysteries which lie
beyond, though they be holier, are not holy unto thee, but only
remote. (The sense of this passage seems to be, that the holiness
of a thing implies its personal relation with one, just as one
cannot blaspheme an unknown god, because one does not know what
to say to annoy him. And this explains the perfect inefficiency
of those who try to insult the saints; the most violent attacks
are very often merely clumsy compliments.)</p>

<p>Now the Angel is spread completely over the Globe, a dewy film
of silver upon that luminous blue.</p>

<p>And a great voice cries: Behold the Queen of Heaven, how she
hath woven her robes from the loom of justice. For as that
straight path of the Arrow cleaving the Rainbow became
righteousness in her that sitteth in the hall of double truth, so
at last is she exalted unto the throne of the High Priestess, the
Priestess of the Silver Star, wherein also is thine Angel made
manifest</p>

<p>And this is the mystery of the camel that is ten days in the
desert, and is not athirst, because he hath within him that water
which is the dew distilled from the Night of Nuit. Triple is the
cord of silver, that it may not be loosed; and three score and a
half a score and three is the number of the name of my name, for
that the ineffable wisdom, that also is of the sphere of the
stars, informeth me. Thus am I crowned with the triangle that is
about the eye, and therefore is my number three. And in me there
is no imperfection, because through me descendeth the influence
of TARO. And that is also the number of Aiwass the mighty Angel,
the Minister of Silence.</p>

<p>And even as the shew-stone burneth thy forehead with its
intolerable flame, so he who hath known me, though but from afar,
is marked out and chosen from among men, and he shall never turn
back or turn aside, for he hath made the link that is not to be
broken, nay, not by the malice of the Four Great Princes of the
evil of the world, nor by Choronzon, that mighty Devil, nor by
the wrath of God, nor by affliction and feebleness of the soul.</p>

<p>Yet with this assurance be not thou content; for though thou
hast wings of the Eagle, they are vain, except they be joined to
the shoulders of the Bull. Now, therefore, I send forth a shaft
of my light, even as a ladder let down from the heaven upon the
earth, and by this black cross of Themis that I hold before thine
eyes, do I swear unto thee that the path shall be open henceforth
for evermore.</p>

<p>There is a clash of a myriad silver cymbals, and silence. And
then three times a note is struck upon a bell, which sounds like
my holy Tibetan bell, that is made of electrum magicum.</p>

<p>I am happily returned unto the earth. Bou-Saada.</p>

<p>December 2, 1909. 12:15-2 A. M.</p>

<p align="center">---------</p>

<p>The above example of one of the most perfect types of Symbolic
Visions cannot be fully appreciated by those who are unacquainted
with the true Keys of the Holy Qabalah, and with some of the
Mysteries of the New Aeon. Those who have made some study of
&quot;Q. B. L.&quot;, of the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, the Tarot,
etc., will soon discover a great many underlying meanings, and to
them the perfect consistency of all the symbolism, will be quite
apparent. In any case, even those who have little knowledge of
such matters, will recognize the beauty, sublimity, and greatness
of this type of Vision, compared with any of a more partial
nature. Of course, this is but one of a series, and by itself is
not very explanatory, but I may add, that all these Visions were
of a definitely Initiatory nature -- so far as the Seer was
concerned -- and at the same time they have a perfectly true
Universal Application. It is a pity this cannot be said in regard
to the average &quot;crystal reading&quot;. But the concentration
of mind obtained by the earnest student of crystal-gazing, may,
as before remarked, result in visions of a much more important
character, if the seer is sufficiently interested in Truth to
learn to make his own Inner Vision, Crystal Clear.</p>
