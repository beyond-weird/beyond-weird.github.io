<p align="center"><b>THE LESSER CRYSTALLINE SPHERE</b></p>

<p>The study of Crystal Gazing without a Crystal would appear
very much like the study of a &quot;Bill of Fare&quot; without
troubling to obtain the material food described thereon. The mere
reading of a book on a subject of this nature without an attempt
to put into practice the processes described -- step by step --
from the very beginning, is futile and a mere waste of time.</p>

<p>The first consideration, therefore (if the would-be seer has
not already attended to the matter), will be the choice of a
suitable <i>Crystal</i><font face="Arial"><i> </i></font>to form
the <i>material basis</i><font face="Arial"><i> </i></font>of his
experiments and a <i>stepping-stone</i><font face="Arial"><i> </i></font>to
the development of his latent powers of clear vision.</p>

<p>In all probability the aspirant to this ancient art has
already been attracted to a Crystal Sphere of this nature, for
there is little doubt of the extraordinary magnetic attraction of
objects of this kind whenever they are exposed to our view, and
since the present interest in this fascinating subject has become
apparent, we may see these Crystals displayed more publicly than
has ever been the case in the past.</p>

<p>In olden times, and even up to the last few years, crystals
were the cherished possessions of those well advanced upon the
Path and kept by them from the eyes of the so-called profane.
Only after having found the way, often with difficulty, to the
presence of these Seers, did an opportunity occur to get even a
glimpse of such a magical link with the invisible spheres.
Fortunately for the modern aspirant, however, this difficulty has
been removed and it has been found that more good may result by a
proper study of this science so as to develop one's own latent
powers, than ever a mere visit to a Seer could produce. Man has
made a considerable advance on the road to Attainment.
Self-development and self-initiation are beginning to play a much
more prominent part than formerly. Man is no longer content to
believe what he is told, he at last desires to <i>know </i>from
his own experience. The Crystal is a stepping-stone towards
Self-knowledge.</p>

<p>We should select our crystal with great care; the more perfect
its quality, the more we should desire it as the means of our
development. It should be neither too large, nor too small, and
here our natural intuition should be allowed to guide us, but I
may say that it is not well that the Sphere be less than two and
one-half inches in diameter, and it is not necessary that it be
more than four. We should choose this crystal, I might almost
say, lovingly; at least, if a selection is presented to us we
should take the one to which, after a moment of silent
consideration, we feel most attracted; and this -- if possible --
regardless of the material consideration of its cost. We should
not, however, purchase a globe which is far beyond our material
means, so that other obligations would suffer thereby; otherwise,
lurking at the back of our consciousness whenever we use it, may
be the feeling of having acted wrongly in that connection from
the very start.</p>

<p>We must realize the importance of this advice, for the great
attraction that the Crystal has for us is something more than the
arousing of a mere idle curiosity on our part. It is no less than
a desire -- subconscious it may be -- to attain the same purity
of soul that we perceive in the Crystal before us, and, as a
matter of fact the results we obtain by a study and practice of
this Art will largely, if not entirely, depend on the purity of
our desire and the quality and state of development of our inner
nature.</p>

<p>That is why I am taking up the material consideration first of
all, for after the crystal has actually come into our possession,
our path lies away from such considerations, at least until we
have attained the success which will surely attend our earnest
efforts in the right direction.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then that the first step has been taken, a
suitable Crystal has been obtained, and that the possessor has
taken it into his own room -- the one he likes best and wherein
he feels most contented and serene. The choice of this room is
also of importance, though in this case we must make the best of
what is at our disposal. If possible this room should be one
wherein we have never had any particularly unpleasant experience,
where there is nothing that we feel antipathy towards, and
wherein are such objects as we love best of all our possessions.
In such an atmosphere the soul of the seer will feel at peace,
free from distractions, and consequently in the right mood to
commence his studies.</p>

<p>The Crystal should first be taken in both hands and held for a
few moments while we close our eyes and, calming the mind, raise
our consciousness to the highest and purest Ideal of which we are
capable. We should persist in our effort toward this state until
we <i>feel </i>that holy calm and stillness, so well symbolized
by the Crystal itself.</p>

<p>We should next turn our attention to the crystal, separating
the thumbs slightly, thus allowing it to rest easily in the
hollow of our hands. We should remember that we, too, rest thus
in the Hollow of the Hand of the Almighty without Whose aid, our
Work must come to naught.</p>

<p>As we look into the depths of this Globe -- material though it
be -- we cannot but be impressed with ideas of Purity. It is
almost as if we gazed into the eyes of a little child, and there
are few who have not experienced a peculiar sensation, almost
amounting to awe, certainly one of wonder, when so doing. The
soul of the seer is very like that of a little child -- or should
be -- and it is in order that we may regain the purity and
perfection of this child-like vision that we set out on this
path. Most of our material surroundings give us a certain feeling
of grossness, few, if any, can compare with the lucid depths of
the crystal now before us.</p>

<p>But, in entering this path, we are about to deal with ideas
and forces, finer and less apparent to our ordinary senses than
any we have yet known. Even the transparent crystal is not as yet
entirely pure, though we may be unable to perceive one spot on
its surface or within its depths.</p>

<p>It is charged with a certain subtle magnetism attracted to it
from the surroundings in which it has been prior to the time we
obtained it. It has passed through many hands before, for a few
moments, it rested in our own while we turned our thoughts inward
and upward towards the Highest. Even as our own aspiration at
that moment was pure, so must we first purify this symbol of our
Inner-self -- the Diamond Soul as it is sometimes called -- for
purification is the <b>first </b>step in the process whereby
Initiation may be obtained. We must pass this material thing --
inorganic and lifeless though it may seem to us -- through the
same processes of Purification, Consecration and Initiation,
through which we in turn desire to pass.</p>

<p>But how may this be accomplished? That is not so difficult as
it might at first appear, but it is quite necessary for all that,
and in order to impress this necessity on your minds I must first
devote a little time to an explanation of the process.</p>

<p>Every material object, including the physical body of man
himself, is but the outward expression of certain finer forms of
matter which interpenetrate it. Thus in the case of man, we may
say he is composed of body, soul and spirit, the soul, in that
case, being the plastic medium which enables the Pure Essence or
Spirit to contact and communicate with the outer physical shell
or envelope. This Soul of man -- and of the World -- is sometimes
called &quot;The Astral Light&quot; or &quot;Plastic
Mediator&quot;, for unlike grosser substances it may be readily
molded at will and without visible means. This Astral Light
interpenetrates all objects, it is invisible to our physical
senses, but its existence both in man and in all nature, makes
possible the power of Clairvoyance -- Clear Vision -- as well as
of Clairaudience and other powers the development of which does
not come within the scope of the present treatise.</p>

<p>This subtle magnetic fluid is everywhere present, and
reflected upon it -- as in a mirror -- may be found all the
events or pictures of what has occurred, or what is occurring on
this planet and even beyond this sphere. The Astral light absorbs
every least impression, and so, even though not apparent to our
normal and undeveloped senses, the astral counterpart of our
Crystal Globe is still charged with impressions of all kinds that
have accumulated within it since its material substance was first
formed. It is because of its attracting these subtle influences
that we wish to make use of it as a medium for bringing them to
our own consciousness, but we must in the first instance
demagnetize it, so as to banish all trace of the past influences
which it still contains.</p>

<p>This may be simply accomplished as follows: </p>

<p align="center"><b>PURIFICATION</b></p>

<p>First place the crystal on a slender cup-like stand. (One may
usually be obtained with the crystal in the first instance.) This
stand should be placed on the surface of a small table, which has
previously been carefully cleansed, and from which all other
objects have been removed.</p>

<p>We may either stand or sit before this table, within easy
reach of the <i>crystal </i>while we perform the first step
towards the purification of our <i>material basis. </i>Next place
the tips of the fingers of both hands together, the thumbs being
also joined, so as to form a circle -- symbol of infinity but
also of a limitation or boundary -- then <i>concentrate the
attention </i>on this circle until you clearly imagine, or
actually feel, a film <i>of fine astral matter, </i>like the film
of a soap-bubble, formed of the fine substance of your own astral
and etheric bodies, spreading over the hollow space between your
hands. As in the former instance, when your whole attention was
turned within, this film should represent to you the highest and
purest of which you are capable. A film of such purity that it
will have the effect of dispelling or banishing every lower
influence it contacts.</p>

<p>Having concentrated your mind in this way for a few moments --
and the ease with which this is accomplished is a good test of
your powers as a crystal-gazer -- you must now slowly move your
hands until they are directly above the crystal on the table, and
still keeping your mind firmly fixed on the idea of this pure
film of astral matter, pass your <i>hands down </i>over the
crystal, thus causing it, in its turn, to pass clear through the
magnetized circle of your hands.</p>

<p>When your hands reach the table at the base of the stand, they
should be drawn apart, thus breaking the &quot;film&quot; and
leaving the crystal above demagnetized of all that is of a lower
vibration than your own highest ideal. It is then like a blank
talisman, or a thing without life. If this first step has been
successfully accomplished, the crystal will now give an
impression of perfect 'cleanliness,' or that is the best
description one can give of the proper result obtained by the
process of purification. It must on no account be touched at this
stage of the work.</p>

<p>The next process is to charge it with your own magnetism, thus
<i>consecrating </i>it to the Work you wish to accomplish.</p>

<p align="center"><b>CONSECRATION</b></p>

<p>If<b> </b>the best results are<b> </b>to be obtained the
crystal<b> </b>must now be <i>consecrated </i>or dedicated to the
special mission for which it is destined. This mission is a very
important one, much greater than we at first imagined perhaps,
for it is no less than that of <i>representing to the seer his
own Soul in the pure condition to which he aspires to bring it. </i>For<i>

</i>that reason, his material basis, the crystal, must never be
used for any but the highest purposes. It is no longer an
ornament that may be placed on the mantel-shelf, but something he
is about to endow with his own life, to charge with his own
highest Will. Thus it becomes something most sacred to him, no
longer an object to be idly handled by the profane any more than
he would allow his own innermost feelings and ideals to be thus
roughly used by every passing stranger. This explains the
attitude of the true Seer of the past; it is not so much that the
Crystals they used became objects of superstitious mystery to the
ignorant, as this sacred value to the Seer himself, which caused
them to be so carefully preserved. Once we understand this, we
shall adopt the right attitude towards our studies from the very
start.</p>

<p>How then must we accomplish the Consecration of our Small
Crystalline Sphere?</p>

<p>Leaving it just where it stands on the table before us we must
next place the tips of our fingers and thumbs together, very much
as before, but this time allowing them to form a perfect
equilateral <i>triangle. </i>Our hands should be held in this
position over the crystal, while we strongly <i>concentrate our
minds </i>on the idea that <i>a positive current </i>is<i> </i>flowing
from them down into the crystal. This current must again
represent our highest aspiration in its purest form, but directed
this time by our True Will. When we fairly feel this current
flowing from our hands, they should be passed gently over the
crystal -- still<i> </i>forming the triangle as before but
gradually allowing the palms to encircle the globe, without
actually touching it; then, when we feel impressed to do so as by
an unseen force, we should gently but firmly grasp the crystal
itself, lifting it from its stand, and allowing our hands to pass
all over its surface. All this while the mind must be kept in the
highest possible condition of pure aspiration, as if we were
giving our very life to this object, as indeed we are, for it now
becomes more than a mere symbol of dead matter, it lives, and we
have brought it to birth as a child of our Will. Henceforth it
must be treated as such, as a sacred instrument, dedicated and
consecrated to the service of the Highest.</p>

<p>And here a warning is necessary, though it will not be needed
by the aspirant to this Art who has followed the directions
hitherto given in the right spirit. This warning was also given
by an earlier writer on this subject, John Melville, he writes:</p>

<p>&quot;A sure and certain law exists, viz: - That if the seer's
<i>purpose </i>be <i>evil </i>when he or she uses the crystal or
mirror, it will <i>react </i>upon the seer sooner or later <i>with
terrible effect; </i>wherefore all are strictly cautioned to <i>be
good </i>and <i>do good </i>only.&quot;</p>

<p>This may sound rather like Sunday-school talk, but when
explained in the light of the principles I have set forth above,
it becomes clear, for we thereby charge the body of our
&quot;child&quot; -- the crystal -- with a force which must
inevitably return to us as its creator, quite apart from any
question of outside influence from &quot;beings&quot; on other
planes.</p>

<p>But he again reminds us that &quot;The aerial spaces are <i>thronged
</i>with countless intelligences -- celestial, <i>good, pure,
true, </i>and the <i>reverse. </i>The latter have <i>force: </i>the
former possess <i>power. </i>To reach the good ones,<i> the heart
of the gazer must correspond, </i>and they should be invoked with
prayerful feelings. There are innumerable multitudes of the <i>bad

</i>on the confines of <i>Matter </i>and <i>Spirit. </i>These
malign forces are many and terrible; but they can never reach the
soul that relies on God in perfect faith, and which only Invokes
the Good, the Beautiful, and True for noble purposes.&quot;</p>

<p>Here we have many fresh ideas that need to be dealt with more
fully in their proper place, but the advice is good, and the
warning necessary to those who, with the best intentions, may
through ignorance of their own nature, and that of the Universe
in which they live and move and have their being, imprudently
attract to themselves forces of evil too great for them to
withstand, thus bringing about obsession, madness or even worse,
through use of wrong methods.</p>

<p align="center"><b>INITIATION</b></p>

<p>This stage in the process of the preparation Of our crystal
has been partially accomplished in the previous section of the
work. We have really CONSECRATED the object by determining to use
it only for the one work before us and for no other purpose, and
we have at least partially INITIATED it by charging it with our
own Will and Life. Initiation means a <i>begin</i>ning and we
shall have made a good beginning If the above instructions have
been carefully and faithfully followed. An elaborate ceremony
might have been adopted, but since we are ourselves only making a
beginning of the Work, such a Ceremony, even if described would
have appeared cumbersome and unwieldy. As it is the merest novice
has no excuse for neglecting the few simple rules laid down,
which in the end, will be seen to have a far greater importance
than is at first imagined.</p>

<p>If we start rightly we shall continue rightly, but a false
start practically ruins our chances of success.</p>

<p>Enough has been accomplished for the moment, and the next step
is to leave the crystal <i>alone </i>for a short time, not to
start to use it immediately. This will be a test of patience, for
one thing, and we shall<b> </b>need all our patience in order to
succeed<b> </b>fully.</p>

<p>But, as with a new born babe, we must not leave our crystal
unprotected.<b> </b>It should be carefully wrapped in a piece of
silk obtained for the purpose and likewise dedicated to that end.
Rose-pink is perhaps the best, as if to suggest our pure love of
this &quot;object&quot; we have so carefully prepared. Outside
that we might well place &quot;grey&quot; and finally

&quot;black&quot; silk wrappings.</p>

<p>If this seems too elaborate, use a piece of pure black silk
only, and whenever the Little Crystalline Sphere is used, first
polish it carefully with this same silk wrapper.</p>

<p>Now put your crystal away, and read the next Chapter carefully
before attempting to use it further.</p>
