<p align="center"><b>A CONSIDERATION OF THE ANCIENT<br>
METHODS</b></p>

<p>The enquirer, having read thus far, will have realized that
behind and beyond all that he may hitherto have considered as the
Art of Crystal Gazing, there is a Greater and Wider field of
application, making necessary more careful preparations, but
leading to correspondingly important results. At this point it
will be necessary for him, or her, to decide whether or not they
are prepared to carry the practice beyond the preliminary stages
already described, and in case they desire to do so, they must be
ready to fulfill the necessary requirements.</p>

<p>We should first consider the best of the ancient instructions
available, and later, we may be able to find points in which they
seem inadequate, and others that can certainly be improved upon.</p>

<p>The Methods of Trithemius of Spanheim - The Friend and Teacher
of Cornelius Agrippa - who lived in the Sixteenth Century, as
transmitted to us by Francis Barrett, who translated his work
from the Latin in the early part of the Nineteenth Century, have
been considered the clearest and best of their kind. We find
parts of these instructions quoted in practically all the books
on the subject that have been published since, sometimes with
acknowledgments and sometimes without.</p>

<p>A few fragments of Barrett's Introduction to that work,
written by him in the form of a letter to a young friend and
fellow Student, may not be out of place here, since the advice
then given, holds equally good at this day.</p>

<p align="center">----------</p>

<p>My Friend:</p>

<p>Knowing thee to be a curious searcher after those sciences
which are out of the common track of study, (I mean the art of
foretelling events, magic, talismans, etc.) I am moved
spiritually to give thee my thoughts upon them, and by these
ideas here written, to open to thine eye (spiritual) as much
information as it seems necessary for thee to know, by which thou
mayest be led by the hand into the delectable field of nature;
and to give thee such documents as, guided by the supreme wisdom
of the Highest, thou mayest refresh thy soul with a delicious
draught of knowledge; so that after recreating thy spirit with
the use of those good gifts which may please God to bestow upon
thee, thou mayest be wrapped up into the contemplation of the
immense wisdom of that great munificent Being who created thee.</p>

<p>Now, thou art a man in whose soul the image of Divinity is
sealed for eternity, think first what is thy desire in searching
after these mysteries? Is it wealth, honour, fame, power, might,
aggrandizement, and the like? Perhaps thy heart says, All I all
these I would gladly crave! If so, this is my answer, - seek
first to know thyself thoroughly, cleanse thy heart from all
wicked, vain and rapacious desires.</p>

<p>To know thyself is to know God, for it is the spiritual gift
from. God that enables a man to know himself. This gift but very
few possess, as may be daily seen.</p>

<p>Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all things shall be
added unto you.</p>

<p>Farewell, remember my poor counsel, and be happy.</p>

<p>F. B.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">OF THE MAKING OF THE CRYSTAL, AND<br>

THE FORM OF PREPARATION FOR A<br>
VISION.</p>

<p>Procure of a lapidary good clear pellucid crystal, of the
bigness of a small orange i.e. about one inch and a half in
diameter; let it be globular or round each way alike; then when
you have got this crystal, fair and clear, without any clouds or
specks, get a small plate of pure gold to encompass the crystal
round one-half; let this be fitted on an ivory or ebony pedestal,
as you may see more fully described in the drawing (see
Frontispiece). Let there be engraved a circle round the crystal
with these characters around inside the circle, next the crystal:
A <i>Hexagram, </i>a <i>Pentagram </i>and a <i>Maltese Cross; </i>afterwards
the name <i>&quot;Tetragrammaton&quot;. </i>On the other side of
the plate let there be engraved <i>&quot;Michael, Gabriel, Uriel,
Raphael;&quot; </i>which are the four principal angels ruling
over the Sun, <i>Moon, Venus </i>and <i>Mercury; </i>but on the
table on which the crystal stands, the following names,
characters, etc., must be drawn in order.</p>

<p>First, the names of the seven planets and angels ruling them,
with their seals and characters. The names of the four kings of
the four corners of the earth. Let them be all written within a
double circle, with a triangle on a table; on which plate the
crystal on its pedestal: this being done, thy table is complete
(as in Frontispiece) and fit for the calling of the spirits;
after which thou shalt proceed to experiment thus:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../images/Crystal_Fronticepiece.gif" width="671" height="928"></p>

<p>In what time thou wouldest, deal with the spirits by the <i>table
</i>and <i>crystal, </i>thou must observe the planetary hour: and
whatsoever planet rules that hour, the angel governing the planet
thou shalt call in the manner following; but first, say this
short prayer.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh God! who art the author of all good things,
strengthen, I beseech thee, thy poor servant, that he may stand
fast, without fear, through this dealing and work: enlighten, I
beseech thee, oh Lord, the dark understanding of thy creature, so
that his spiritual eye may be opened to see and know thy angelic
spirits descending here in this crystal: <i>(Then </i>lay <i>thy
hand on the crystal saying,) </i>and thou, oh inanimate creature
of God, be sanctified and consecrated, and blessed to this
purpose, that no evil phantasy may appear in thee; or, if they do
gain ingress into this creature, they may be constrained to speak
intelligibly, and truly, and without the least ambiguity, for
Christ's sake. <i>Amen. </i></p>

<p>&quot;And forasmuch as thy servant here standing before thee,
oh Lord! desires neither evil treasure, nor injury to his
neighbor, nor hurt to any living creature, grant him the power of
descrying those celestial spirits or intelligences, that may
appear in this crystal, and whatever good gifts (whether the
power of healing infirmities, or of imbibing wisdom, or
discovering any evil likely to afflict any person or family, or
any other gift) thou mayest be pleased to bestow on me, enable
me, by thy wisdom and mercy, to use whatever I may receive to the
honour of thy holy name. Grant this for thy son Christ's sake.
Amen.&quot;</p>

<p>Then taking your ring and pentacle, put the ring on the little
finger of your right hand; hang the pentacle round thy neck; <i>(Note,
</i>the pentacle may be either written on clean virgin parchment,
or engraven on a square plate of silver and suspended from thy
neck to the breast), then take your black ebony wand with the
gilt characters on it and trace the circle, saying, &quot;In the
name of the blessed Trinity, I consecrate this piece of ground
for our defense; so that no evil spirit may have power to break
these bonds prescribed here, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;
<i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Then place the vessel for the perfumes between thy circle and
the holy table on which the crystal stands, and, having fire
therein, cast in thy perfumes, saying.</p>

<p>&quot;I conjure thee, oh thou creature of fire! by him who
created all things both in heaven and earth, and in the sea, and
in every other place whatever, that forthwith thou cast away
every phantasm from thee, that no hurt whatsoever shall be done
in anything. Bless, oh Lord, this creature of fire, and sanctify
it that it may be blessed, and that they may fill up the power
and virtue of their odours; so neither the enemy, nor any false
imagination may enter into them; through our Lord Jesus Christ. <i>Amen.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Now, this being done in the order prescribed, take thy little
book, which must be made about seven inches long, of pure white
virgin vellum or paper, likewise pen and ink must be ready to
write down the <i>name, character, </i>and <i>office, </i>likewise
the seal or image of whatever spirit may appear (for this I must
tell you that it does not happen that the same spirit you call
will always appear, for you must try the spirit to know whether
he be a pure or impure being, and this thou shalt easily know by
a firm and undoubted faith in God).</p>

<p>Now the most pure and simple way of calling the spirits or
spirit is by a short oration to the spirit himself, which is more
effectual and easy to perform than composing a table of letters;
for all celestial operations, the more pure and unmixed they are,
the more they are agreeable to the celestial spirits: therefore,
after the circle is drawn, the book, perfumes, rod, etc., in
readiness, proceed as follows:</p>

<p>(After noticing the exact hour of the day, and what angel
rules that hour, thou shalt say.)</p>

<p>&quot;In the name of the blessed and holy Trinity, I do desire
thee, thou strong and mighty angel Michael (or any other angel or
spirit), that if it be the divine will of him who is called
Tetragrammaton, etc., the Holy God, the Father, that thou take
upon thee some shape as best beseemeth thy celestial nature, and
appear to us visibly here in this crystal, and answer our demands
in as far as we shall not transgress the bounds of the divine
mercy and goodness, by requesting unlawful knowledge; but that
thou will graciously shew us what things are most profitable for
us to know and do, to the glory and honour of his divine Majesty,
who liveth and reigneth, world without end. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Lord, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven:
-make clean our hearts within us, and take not thy Holy Spirit
from us.</p>

<p>&quot;0 Lord, by thy name, we have called him, suffer him to
administer unto us. And that all things may work together for thy
honour and glory, to whom with thee, the Son, and blessed Spirit
be ascribed all might, majesty and dominion. <i>Amen.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>Note, </i>In these dealings, two should always be present;
for often a spirit is manifest to one in the crystal when the
other cannot perceive him; therefore if any spirit appear, as
there most likely will, to one or both say,</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Lord! we return thee our hearty and sincere thanks
for the hearing of our prayer, and we thank thee for having
permitted thy spirit to appear unto us which we, by thy mercy,
will interrogate to our further instruction, through Christ. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>Interrog. 1. In the name of the holy and undefiled Spirit, the
Father, the begotten Son, and Holy Ghost, proceeding from both,
what is thy true name?</p>

<p>If the spirit answers, <i>Michael, </i>then proceed.</p>

<p>Question 2. What is thy office? 3. What is thy true sign or
character? 4. When are the times most agreeable to thy nature to
hold conference with us?</p>

<p>Wilt thou swear by the blood and righteousness of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that thou art truly Michael?</p>

<p>(Let him swear, then write down his seal or character in thy
book, and against it, his office and times to be called, through
God's name; also write down anything he may teach thee, or any
responses he may make to thy questions or interrogations,
concerning life or death, arts or sciences, or any other thing) ;
and then thou shalt say,</p>

<p>&quot;Thou great and mighty spirit, inasmuch as thou camest in
peace and in the name of the ever blessed and righteous Trinity,
so in this name thou mayest depart, and return to us when we call
thee in his name to whom every knee doth bow down. Fare thee
well, Michael; peace be between us, through our blessed Lord
Jesus Christ. <i>Amen.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Then will the spirit depart; then say, &quot;To God the
Father, eternal Spirit, fountain of Light, the Son, and Holy
Ghost, be all honour and glory, world without end. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p>I shall here set down the Table of the names of Spirits and
Planets governing the Hours; so thou shalt easily know by
inspection, what Spirit and<b> </b>Planet governs every Hour of
the Day and night in the Week.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/hours1.gif" width="339" height="446"> <img src="../../images/hours2.gif" width="374" height="450"></p>

<p><i>Note, </i>the<i> </i>day is divided into twelve equal
parts, called planetary hours, reckoning from sun-rise to sun-set
and, again, from the setting to the rising; and to find the
planetary hour, you need but to divide the natural hours by
twelve, and the quotient gives the length of the planetary hours
and odd minutes, which shows you how long a spirit bears rule in
that day; as Michael governs the first and the eighth hour on
Sunday, as does the Sun. After you have the length, of the first
hour, you have only to look in the table, as if it be the fourth
hour, on Sunday, you see in the Table that the Moon and Gabriel
rules; and so for the rest it being so plain and easy you cannot
err.&quot;</p>

<p>This concludes the Ancient Instruction.</p>

<p>Although at first reading the above instructions may appear
comparatively simple, as in fact they are, the student will soon
find that a great deal of further information is desirable, and
necessary in order to obtain a thorough practical grasp of the
matter. The more astute will discover that a much wider knowledge
of Magick and Occultism is implied, than is possessed by the
average reader. Herein lies the difficulty of the present author,
who, while desirous of being really helpful to earnest Students,
knows clearly the obstacles to the practical application of this
method of working.</p>

<p>For instance, we have been supplied with details whereby we
may appear to stand a fair chance of invoking the Angel <i>Michael
</i>(always provided our intentions are pure, and we are of that
simple Religious turn of mind, prepared be believe implicitly in
the instructions and the Powers Invoked, without questioning the <i>reason
</i>why things are <i>thus </i>and so and not <i>otherwise), </i>but
<i>Michael is </i>but one of the seven Angels mentioned in the
table of Planets and Rulers, and his services are only at our
disposal at intervals.</p>

<p>In order to be in a position to invoke the Angels of the other
hours and Planets, we must be in possession of their Names in
Hebrew, together with their Sigils or <i>Characters, </i>and
these must be Written on the Circle and Table in place of those
given in the Plate. Also, in place of the Symbol of The Sun, on
the rim of the Circle, must be placed the proper Planetary Symbol
corresponding to the Angel Invoked; and so on.</p>

<p>Nor do our difficulties end here, for we may ask why the Sigil
(that peculiar figure placed under the name Michael within the
Hexagon on the <i>Table, </i>and on the upper left hand side of
the <i>Circle) </i>should be that of Michael, and no other. In
order to answer this, the methods of drawing the Sigils of
Angels, Intelligences, and Spirits,<b> </b>from their Magic
Squares, or by other means, would need explanation.</p>

<p>Magick is in truth the Science of Life itself, and all things
in True Magick have a perfectly clear and lucid explanation, each
step has a definite connection with the one before and the one
following. But that is where the practical difficulty comes in;
we want to learn Crystal Gazing, and we find that before we can
do anything with the matter properly, we must have learned many
other things, in order to be in position even to carry out such a
simple Ceremony as above described. On the other hand, if things
are (apparently) made too easy for us, we fail to understand the
underlying principles involved, and through failure to obtain a
proper grasp of the matter, we are led into a condition where,
instead of us having the proper Power and Authority over the
spirit invoked, IT has power over us, and since we have no means
of TESTING its true NATURE, we may easily be deceived, led into
further error, and finally lost.</p>

<p>Every Divine Name, for instance, on the <i>Circle </i>or <i>Holy
Table </i>shown in the Plate, has a very definite meaning, and is
placed just where it is for a very definite reason. To the
Magician, who understands every detail, these form the best and
only true PROTECTION, since he USES these things as his
instruments and relies on his power to use them rightly. To the
novice or uninitiate, they mean little or nothing, and how can he
USE things he understands nothing about. Of course the fact that
he must procure even these few simple materials, and fashion them
properly, gives him a certain knowledge of the matter, but a very
superficial one. And these articles are not so <i>easily procured
</i>as one might imagine.</p>

<p>Take for instance &quot;The Black Ebony Wand&quot; shown in
the illustration, which we are told to engrave with certain Names
and Figures. If made, what will this wand mean to us?</p>

<p>It may mean a stick of wood, without life, and little more
than a walking-stick (if as much), or it may represent our
Highest and Most Divine Possession.</p>

<p>The True Wand is the Divine Will in Man, and one who is thus
able to exercise the Divine Will, may certainly be in a position
to use it to Consecrate a Circle. The Wand here described is a
Symbol of that Will and to prepare it we must have gone through a
Ceremony very like the one described in the First Chapter of this
Book, in regard to the Crystal, but much more powerful, since we
are dealing with our chief Magical Weapon. Why is the Wand Black?
To represent perfect Understanding on the part of the Instrument,
and perfect absorption of the Will of the Operator, which in turn
is God's Will. It thus forms a veritable &quot;Hollow Tube to
bring down fire from Heaven&quot;. Again its substance is rigid
and unbending <b>ebony</b> to represent the Power of Unconquered
Will. Engraved upon it are the Words of Power
AGLA-ON-TETRAGRAMMATON, and on the reverse side EGO ALPHA ET
OMEGA. What is the meaning of this to one who realizes the nature
of the Wand? AGLA is a Word of Power, the Initials of which form
the sentence &quot;Ateh Geburah le-Olahm Adonai&quot; which means
&quot;Unto Thee be the Power 0 My Lord Adonai&quot; thus
asserting the Power of Adonai, The Higher Self of Man (and of
Humanity) as Lord of All. The next Word, ON, is the Name of the
SUN in the old Egyptian Language, and the Sun again represents
The Power on High giving Life to all beings on this planet; again
it has a correspondence in ourselves, as, the Human Will situated
in the Heart, etc.</p>

<p>TETRAGRAMMATON, means the Four Lettered Name, the Ineffable
Name IHVH, having Power over all the Elements, and representing
the complete FORMULA of the MAGICK SYSTEM here used. The words on
the reverse side &quot;EGO ALPHA ET OMEGA&quot; mean &quot;I am
Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the first and the
Last&quot; thus asserting the Wand or True Will to be supreme,
and also containing the Greek formula of IAO, which is similar to
that of Tetragrammaton.</p>

<p>This will give the Student some idea of what is involved in
even such an apparently simple set of Magical Instruments as is
here depicted. Is he prepared to assert his Will as the Will of
God and the Universe? If not, he is not ready to acquire and use
the Wand. So it is with the other instruments, about which a long
treatise might be written, most useful and interesting to the <i>few
</i>earnest Students, but quite beyond the comprehension of the
ordinary reader.</p>

<p>It would give the Author great pleasure to write such a
treatise around the simple ceremony above described, but the
limits of this little book will not permit. Should a real demand
arise, it will no doubt become possible for the real student to
obtain the information necessary. For it is written &quot;When
the Pupil is ready the Master appears.&quot;</p>
