<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS - THE METHODS<br>
OF DR. DEE AND SIR EDWARD KELLY</b></p>

<p>There is one point the Student may, or may not, have noticed
in regard to the Simple Ceremony described in the previous
chapter, viz: the entire absence of any ceremony of Purification
or Banishing.</p>

<p>This may be accounted for by the fact that the Operator is
supposed to be one who has implicit faith and trust in the Divine
Powers Invoked, but it is only the Purest and Highest type of
Seer who can safely use these methods, and at the same time,
their simplicity is likely to attract the most ignorant.</p>

<p>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and Magick either
requires a great deal of knowledge, or <i>none at all, </i>and
when we say <i>None at all </i>we<i> </i>mean Knowledge must have
been transcended and have given place to Understanding or Direct
Perception.</p>

<p>There are proper Ceremonies for Banishing and Invoking which
should be used whenever a Circle is used in an operation of this
sort. Again, to understand them rightly requires considerable
work on the part of the Student.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to discourage the beginner from an
attempt to put into practice any part of this Art, which however
is also a Science. No Science can be learned in a day, and unless
the Scientific aspect be first mastered, how can one be in a
position to carry out the practical side in a skillful manner,
befitting any of the Arts.</p>

<p>A few words should be written on the necessity of Banishing
before undertaking any Occult or Magical Work. When we first of
all dealt with our crystal, we found it necessary to Banish from
it any impure Astral Influences that might have been present
within it, after which we Consecrated it, and Charged it with our
Will. It is equally necessary, therefore, that in the event of
our desiring to Work within a Magic Circle, drawn on the floor of
our Temple, (or Room) we should FIRST BANISH all impure
influences from that room, or at least cause them to remain
OUTSIDE the CIRCLE, which in this case is but Symbolical of THE
UNIVERSAL CRYSTALLINE SPHERE from which we desire to call down
influence upon our LESSER CRYSTALLINE SPHERE, and in turn to be
able to comprehend them, by means of a Vision, within our own
CRYSTAL SPHERE -- THE SOUL.</p>

<p>If this Soul is Pure and Clear in the first instance, nothing
can harm it, but usually the practices we undertake are for the
purpose of purifying our own vehicle.</p>

<p>The burning of incense may help to purify the atmosphere in
our surroundings, but this incense itself is impure until it has
been <i>PURIFIED </i>and <i>CONSECRATED to </i>the work in hand.
This at least we may accomplish, by methods very similar to those
adopted in the case of the crystal. A more elaborate preparation
is certainly advisable, but this is not the place to enter into
full details of the Banishing Rituals of the Pentagram and
Hexagram. These details may be found in &quot;The Equinox.&quot;
Vol. I Number 2 by those who need them sufficiently to feel it
worth while to obtain them.</p>

<p>The practical importance, however, of these Rituals cannot be
overrated. They form a means of Banishing all that is undesirable
in our surroundings, Elementary, Planetary and Zodiacal; and also
of invoking the Powers of the Elements, Planets and Signs in the
proper way.</p>

<p>The failure to understand these things has led in the past to
many disastrous results; and the world today seems blissfully
ignorant of even the necessity of any such performance, while at
the same time attempting to deal with &quot;Phenomena&quot; of a
Spiritualistic Type, which in many instances is nearer to the
necromantic results of Evocation than the comparatively safe
methods of Invocation described in the last chapter.</p>

<p>We may now turn our attention to some of the possible results
of Crystal Gazing, when undertaken in the right manner. This, at
least, may encourage the enquirer to &quot;make himself fit&quot;
to accomplish similar results in time.</p>

<p>Few people realize what an important factor the Crystal has
played, and is playing, in events of Planetary Importance
concerning the Initiation of the whole of Humanity. It seems a
far cry from the practice of Crystal Gazing to the New Aeon, but
it may be there is more than a slight connection even in that
instance. In any case, the practice may lead to results far
greater than ever imagined in the beginning, and these results
may only become manifest long after the original seer has passed
away and is almost forgotten.</p>

<p>In any case it is doubtful whether the old Abbot Trithemius of
Spanheim dreamed that his instructions, written so long ago, were
going to be copied and commented upon in this little book, or
could have foreseen -- any more than the present author can
foresee -- the result upon the lives of those who may read them
and act upon them in the future.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the Sixteenth and early part of the
Seventeenth Centuries, there lived another man, to whom the Art
of Crystal Gazing came to mean much. I refer to Dr. Dee who
during his Occult career made the acquaintance of a certain
Crystal Gazer known as Edward Kelly. The result of their work is
certainly active today, and had it not been for them, it is very
doubtful if the present treatise would ever have been written.</p>

<p>Quoting from a recently published <i>Life of John Dee</i> by
Charlotte Fell Smith (although this book is not of great
practical importance to the Student) we obtain the following:</p>

<p align="center">THE CRYSTAL GAZERS</p>

<p>&quot;It is a curious picture to call up, that of the
strangely assorted pair seated in the inner room at Mortlake,
acting out this spiritual drama. Dee had asked for instructions
about the room for the sittings:</p>

<p>&quot;May my little farthest chamber serve, if the bed be
taken down?&quot; The table, covered with its cloth, stood in the
centre upon the seals. Kelly, perhaps with the black cap he is
credited with having always worn, pulled close over his ears, was
seated at it. Dee at his desk sat writing in the great folio
book. He was now fifty-six years old; his beard was long, but
perhaps not yet 'as white as milk' as Aubrey describes it. He did
not apparently see the visions himself. Once he reproachfully
said: 'You know I cannot see or skry'. He conversed with the
spirits and sometimes heard what they said; but to the eye and
ear of his body they were invisible; hence his dependence upon a
skryer.</p>

<p>&quot;The sole object of his ambition was the attainment of
legitimate wisdom. When conversing with the angels, how near
within his grasp it seemed! Michael's exposition seemed almost to
promise it to him:</p>

<p>&quot;'Wilt thou have witt and wisdom? Here it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Michael points each time to a figure of seven squares
shown within a circle of light.</p>

<p>&quot;'The exaltation and government of princes is in my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;'In counsayle and Nobilitie, I prevayle.</p>

<p>&quot;'The Gayne and Trade of Merchandise is in my hand. Lo I
here it is.</p>

<p>&quot;'The Qualitie of the Earth and Waters is my knowledge,
and I know them. And here it is.</p>

<p>&quot;'The motion of the Ayre and those that move in it, are
all known to me. Lo! here they are.</p>

<p>&quot;'I<font face="Arial"> </font>signifie wisdom. In fire is
my government, I was in the beginning and shall be to the end.</p>

<p>&quot; 'Mark these mysteries. For this knowne, the state of
the whole earth is knowne, and all that is thereon. Mighty is
God, yea, mighty is he who hath composed forever. Give diligent
eye. Be wise, merry and pleasant in the <i>Lord.&quot;'</i></p>

<p>Here we have one of the communications from the Angel Michael
that has been Historically recorded. In fact a great deal of the
work of Dee and Kelly remains in actual writing to this day. Many
of their formulae are being used by the true Adepts, and much
work has yet to be done in order to make the meaning of this
early work entirely clear. The public knows little or nothing of
all this, but I may quote from certain Official Instructions of
The Great White Brotherhood or A. A. which deals with the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;The Skryer (Edward Kelly) obtained from certain Angels a
series of seven talismans. These, grouped about the Holy
Twelvefold Table, similarly obtained, were part of the furniture
of the Holy Table.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Other Pantacles were obtained in a similar manner. Here
(Figure V) is the principal one, which carved in wax, was placed
upon the top of the table. On four others stood the feet of the
table.</p>

<p>&quot;Note first the Holy Sevenfold Table containing seven
Names of God which not even the Angels are able to pronounce.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../images/Crystal_Ameth_god_names.gif" width="223" height="200"></p>

<p>&quot;These names are seen written without the heptagram
within the heptagon.&quot;</p>

<p>This Holy Sevenfold Table is probably the one referred to by
the Angel Michael in the communication above quoted. It forms the
Key to manifold and great Mysteries.</p>

<p>By reading these obliquely are obtained the names of other
sets of Angels, some of which were attributed to the Metals of
the Planets, as also by other methods of reading can be obtained
the Names of the Seven Great Angels, etc., etc. All the names of
the Angels thus drawn from the Sevenfold Table appear on the
Pantacle or SIGILLUM DEI AEMETH.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../images/Crystal_Ameth.gif" width="618" height="614"></p>

<p>Dr. Dee also had a <i>Shew-stone, </i>a<i> </i>crystal which
he alleged, to have been brought to him by angels. This was
placed upon the Table, and the principal result of the ceremonial
skrying of Sir Edward Kelly, was the obtaining of a series of
wonderful diagrams, containing the Keys to all the mysteries of
the Universe.</p>

<p>He symbolized the Fourth-Dimensional Universe in two
dimensions as a square surrounded by 30 concentric circles,
(known as the 30 Aethyrs or Aires) whose radii increase in
geometrical proportion.</p>

<p>The sides of the square formed Four Great Watch-Towers which
are attributed to the elements, these in turn are all governed by
what is known as <i>The Table of Union, </i>attributed to Spirit.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee also obtained the Alphabet of the Angelic Language, in
which all these mysteries were written. It is sometimes called
the Enochian Alphabet, as the angels claimed to be those which
conversed with the &quot;patriarch Enoch&quot; of Jewish fable.</p>

<p>The Thirty Aires or Aethyrs, surrounding the Material
Universe, each had their special name, drawn from these
pantacles. Also the names of their Governors were drawn from the
same sources. Each of the Aethyrs had three governors, and these
in turn controlled from two to nine thousand servitors.</p>

<p>A series of Forty-eight <i>Calls </i>or Invocations were also
obtained in the Angelic Language, and by means of these it became
possible to Invoke to Visible Appearance all these Aethyric
Spheres, with their Angel Guardians. This gives but a slight idea
of the extent of the practical Magical work done by Dee and Kelly
by means of the Crystal or Shew-Stone.</p>

<p>This work has formed the basis of much of the Magical Work of
the Adepts of this present time, and was instrumental in bringing
about what we now know as The New Aeon. Almost all will now have
recognized that we are living in a New Age or Era, and the
Magical Forces which have brought this about, are largely due, in
the first instance, to the <i>Keys </i>to the Higher Spheres
obtained by Dee and Kelly, some centuries before Humanity was
ripe for the actual Initiating of the Current of Higher Will,
which the practical use of these Keys made possible in this age.</p>

<p>All this may sound highly fantastical to those who have no
initiated knowledge of the Universe, or of the nature and powers
of Man. We do not wish to labor the point, but it illustrates how
important the Crystal may become in the hands of a true Seer.</p>

<p>The Real Prophet is one who has also the Power to make his
prophesies come true. That is the difference between the Major
and the Minor Prophets. In this instance many things <i>seen </i>by
Dee and Kelly are coming true, but chiefly because a greater
Adept than either of them, grasped the possibilities of their
Visions and by his Mighty Will, put the necessary Forces into
action. We may now consider what is meant by a <i>Shew-Stone.</i></p>

<p>This, in the instance above cited, consisted not in a crystal
sphere placed upon a stand on the table, but in a <i>stone </i>pressed
to the forehead of the Seer. At least such was the material means
used in obtaining the Visions of the 30 Aethyrs by Frater 0. M.
just before and after The Equinox of the Gods which occurred in
1904 E. V.</p>

<p>In that instance a great Topaz, set in a Scarlet Cross, was
used. The process was somewhat different from ordinary
crystal-gazing, as likewise were the results.</p>

<p>The place of what is known as the &quot;Third Eye&quot; in
man, is just above and between the exterior organs of sight. This
is known in Hindu Systems as the &quot;Ajna Chakra&quot; and is
thought by some to correspond to the Pineal Gland.</p>

<p>Intense concentration on this &quot;Lotus&quot; or
&quot;Chakra&quot; produces Visions of a very high character, and
this concentration may be increased or aided-by the pressure of a
<i>skew-stone </i>to<font face="Arial"> </font>the forehead just
over this &quot;third-eye.&quot;</p>

<p>In that case the Vision is turned <i>inwards </i>towards the
Ajna Chakra, instead of concentrated on an outside object such as
the crystal. When the power of concentration has been developed
by means of crystal-gazing (as described in the earlier chapters
of this book) this concentration may be taken up by the INTERIOR
ORGANS OF VISION, and the visions perceived, not in physical
space, but in the Chitakasha or MENTAL SPACE. Visions of this
nature are usually of much greater value than the others which
result from our early practices with the eyes open.</p>

<p>Consideration of Visions of this type, as of the proper means
of obtaining them, will lead us well on the path to obtaining
true Crystal Vision. Since, however, it forms a different aspect
of the Work, it will be best to treat of it in another Chapter.</p>
