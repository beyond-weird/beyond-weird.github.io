<p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>THE GREATER CRYSTALLINE SPHERE</b></p>

<p>We have given some consideration to the proper preparation of
our Crystal, or, as we termed it in the last chapter, the Lesser
Crystalline Sphere. We must now pay some attention to the
necessary condition of our own Inner Being or what we may term
The Greater Crystalline Sphere. </p>

<p>The attitude of mind in which we approach the practice of the
Art of Crystal-Gazing, will largely determine the results to be
obtained therefrom. These may be little or great, as we ourselves
look at the matter from a narrow or broad point of view.</p>

<p>Those who enter upon this study, actuated by a mere idle
curiosity, after having attempted to satisfy it, may find there
is apparently very little to be gained, while, on the other hand,
even if in the first instance curiosity alone was our motive, it
may give place to a genuine and lasting interest, leading to the
highest results, if we are prepared to add to our original
impulse enough energy to carry us through the very necessary
preliminary practices by which alone, success may be assured.</p>

<p>There are two important factors entering into this
proposition, The Seer or Gazer and the Crystal or object used to
concentrate the gaze upon. The proper relation of these two is
what brings about the desired result, viz: Clear Vision.</p>

<p>Now the clarity of our vision depends chiefly upon ourselves,
not upon the crystal which is but a convenient means of acquiring
this. We should now spend a few minutes in self-examination, in
the same way that we did when we first examined the crystal or
material basis of the work.</p>

<p>Why have we been attracted to the crystal. is just as
important a question as why did the crystal attract us? In fact
much more important, for our whole future may depend upon this
curious meeting. Was it because we had been told, or that we
imagined, that by some mysterious means we should thereby be
enabled to peer into the future there to discover what lies
before us on Life's Path, or what lies before those whom we hold
dear as friends or acquaintances? Was it that we might perchance
see the vision of one whom we had idealized in our imagination as
a soul-mate, and hoped thereby to be assured of the actual
existence of such? Was it that we might pry into the distant
past, or even into the immediate past, of the lives of those with
whom we are in daily contact, so that we might thereby obtain a
knowledge of events that would at the same time put us in
possession of a certain degree of power? Or was it as a stepping
stone to really Clear Vision, a better understanding of Life
itself, of our own being, and our true relationship with our
environment in a larger sense than could be expected by mere
physical means?</p>

<p>Probably our motives may have been compounded of some or all<b>
</b>of these, and many more, and on that account be somewhat
vague and uncertain. In that case we must at first expect a
certain vagueness and uncertainty in our visions. In proportion
to the clarity of our own conceptions, must our visions appear
hazy or perfect in every way. &quot;A true vision is to awakement
as awakement is to a dream: and a perfect vision is so nearly
perfect Reality that words cannot be found in which to translate
it, yet it must not be forgotten that its truth ceases on return
of the seer to the Material plane&quot;. This statement was made
by one of the Great Seers, one who no longer needs the aid of a
crystal, yet it holds good in this case also and will give the
aspirant a glimpse of what may be expected provided we go to the
trouble to thus perfect our instrument -- the Greater Crystalline
Sphere.</p>

<p>A certain honesty of purpose is requisite to this Art, that is
to say if it is our true desire to obtain the beat results. The
Good the Beautiful and the True are the natural desires of the
human soul, any inclination towards the reverse, shows an
imperfection in our Crystalline Sphere which needs to be
eradicated. Fortunately the Soul of man is Plastic and unlike the
Hard Crystal Globe, may be easily worked upon and remolded nearer
to the heart's desire.</p>

<p>A certain honesty of purpose must also be apparent in the
instructions we follow, and for that reason it may be well to say
a few words about the &quot;crystals&quot; and books on
Crystal-Gazing which may come into the hands of the Student.</p>

<p>First then in regard to Crystals and &quot;crystals&quot;. In
all probability the crystal you have purchased, purified,
consecrated, initiated and wrapped away so carefully, is not a
real crystal at all. This news may come to you with a kind of
sickening shock. But this shock will not last long if your own
&quot;Greater Crystal&quot; the Inner Part of your being is true,
and if you have faithfully carried out the preliminary
instructions as directed. You have accepted this symbolic crystal
as your &quot;child&quot;, as something into which you have
directed your highest aspiration and will. It matters little what
the substance is composed of, so long as it has now become for
you a sacred thing.</p>

<p>But how could you have been thus deceived if such were the
case. Through ignorance of the real value of Crystal. In all
probability the ball you purchased cost but a few dollars,
whereas, had it been genuine Crystal, it would have been much
beyond your means, or at least have cost more than you were
prepared to risk on the experiment in hand. You have probably
obtained a very carefully cut and polished sphere of glass, free
from flaws and difficult and expensive to make. But it is a
manufactured article, not a natural stone. It may be you could
see little difference between it and a genuine stone, but the
difference lies <i>within, </i>for the real crystal is built up
by Nature on hexagonal lines, yet so clear and transparent is the
stone that we do not see them. The one true test of all the
crystal family is the fact that the <i>angle of incidence </i>remains
the same in each species. Now the Hexagram symbolizes the
Macrocosm, the Great Universe, or God. For the moment we have
described the Soul of Man as our Greater Crystalline Sphere. In
many cases this Soul has not attained to its greatest purity, and
is little more than the Glass Sphere is to the Genuine Crystal.</p>

<p>Let this teach you your first great lesson in the Art, not to
be deceived by, appearances, for it is written &quot;The Devil
himself may appear to us as an Angel of Light&quot;. Yet do not
be discouraged by this discovery, let us examine the matter more
closely. Crystals are comparatively rare, and while little in
demand, and that only by the most earnest seekers and Seers who
were prepared to &quot;Buy their eggs without haggling&quot;, the
supply was ample to fill the needs of those who sought after
them. Today Crystal-Gazing has taken a more popular aspect, and
attracts -- in many instances -- less serious people, or those
who are not prepared to pay very highly for the fulfillment of
their desires. Consequently a demand has arisen for
&quot;something very like the real&quot; -- just as good perhaps
for the majority of persons -- but, what is more serious, there
is likely to be a corresponding decline in the value of the
practice, for less care may be taken in the methods used, and so
on, till -- like many other studies -- it fails to be understood
and thus falls into disrepute.</p>

<p>Fortunately the matter is not irreparable when understood in
its true light, and greater reliance placed upon the inner powers
of the Seer than on the objects at which he gazes. He cannot
change glass into crystal in the case of the globe before him,
but he may change Glass into Crystal in the case of his own Inner
Being, and the latter is far the most important consideration
after all.</p>

<p>Next, in regard to books on the subject of Crystal-Gazing, we
find the Art mentioned here and there in a great many Ancient and
Modern treatises on Occult matters, but there are few books of a
serious nature devoted entirely to this subject. What we do see
are usually produced in such a catch-penny style that they are
immediately associated with 'fortune-telling' and 'dream-books'
of the lowest order.</p>

<p>There is one little book, however, that is well worthy of
notice as it is evidently an earnest effort on the part of the
Author to set forth the main principles, as far as known to him,
in a truly helpful manner. I refer to &quot;Crystal Gazing and
Clairvoyance&quot; by John Melville. Published London 1910 by
Nichols and Co. in a new and revised form. I shall refer to this
little book again from time to time, meanwhile I should tell you
that it is out of print and not available in America in that
form. I may remark, however, that it has been copied almost word
for word by a person who, claiming to be an occultist, should
know better. The book was Copyrighted in England in 1896, but
apparently no American protection was secured by the Author or
Publisher. In that case it may be just within the scope of
legitimate business to publish an American Edition without
permission of the author or his agents, but in the case I refer
to even the Author's Preface was copied word for word and signed
by the impostor with his own name as being author of the whole
treatise; acknowledged references in the book itself to other
contributors were deliberately deleted and so changed that credit
was no longer given to original sources, and in addition
Copyright was claimed by the plagiarist, not alone in America but
even in England and other Countries covered by the original
Copyright. A warning was added that the contents of the volume
must not be copied in any way without written permission,
disregard of which would subject the offender to the penalty
provided by law. This seems to me to add insult to injury and,
whether the laws of the Country overlook such things or not, the
Law of Karma must in the long run deal with anyone who steals
another man's work and calls it his own and<b> </b>then foists it
upon the public, making everyone who purchases the book, whether
ignorant of the truth or otherwise, what can scarcely be other
than a receiver of stolen goods.</p>

<p><i>[Transcriber's note: The person being referred to above is
L.W. de Laurence, a notorious literary thief.]</i></p>

<p>From an occult point of view these circumstances practically
bar the serious student from any benefit he might otherwise have
derived from a study of the book itself, but fortunately, that is
not essential as after all the treatise leaves much to be
desired.</p>

<p>You may learn a further important lesson from what has just
been recited, viz: Don't be content to rely upon appearances, and
when you obtain a <i>message </i>from whatever source don't be
too sure that the source is the same that it purports to be, or
that you imagine it to be. In Crystal-Gazing, and all similar
practices this is of vital importance, for neglect of this
warning, may lead you far astray from the true Path. St. John
knew his business when he said: <i>&quot;Test ye the spirits, </i>whether
they be of God.&quot; (Good). And this <i>testing </i>of your
sources of information, as well as of your own motives is of
primary import.</p>

<p>To return, however, to John Melville's little book, it is cast
in the following form. First the composition of Beryls or
Crystals is taken up; but for reasons mentioned earlier in this
chapter, this aspect is of no great importance to the modern
enquirer. Then the derivation of the name is discussed and
certain other matters of a hypothetical nature are enquired into.
The Ancient Methods of Ceremonial in connection with the Art are
summarized, and a few practical directions for the modern student
follow. This concludes the first part of the book dealing
particularly with the matter in hand. The second part is by
another author, and entitled &quot;Hygienic Clairvoyance&quot;,
the title being a most unfortunate one in my opinion, although
there are some interesting hints in regard to &quot;Induced
Clairvoyance&quot; towards the end of the book. But there is no <i>connected

</i>and systematic thread to guide the student through the
various stages that may be necessary for him in order to attain a
complete knowledge and experience of the whole matter. For that
reason, having been requested to prepare a new and original
account of the processes involved, I have decided to start at the
very beginning, and lead the student by gradual stages to a
comprehension of the larger outcome of the Work.</p>

<p>But it is now time for us to consider the early stages of the
practical work, taking up the thread from where we left it at the
end of the last chapter.</p>

<p>Therefore take your crystal and polish it carefully placing it
upon its stand near you, while you pay attention to the following
directions.</p>

<p>In the first instance your desire is merely to cultivate a
certain degree of clairvoyant power by the regular use of this
globe. By this means what are called &quot;visions&quot; of
things or events, past, present or future may appear clearly to
the inner sight or eye of the soul.</p>

<p>No great harm can come from this practice, provided that the
inner motives of the Seer are kept pure and no attempt is made to
prostitute it to undesirable ends. Looked upon as a process of
self-development leading to concentration of the powers of the
mind, and a widening of the mental horizon, the practice of this
art may be recommended to almost everyone.</p>

<p>The rules laid down by John Melville for this stage of the
work are clear and concise, and leave little to be desired, I
shall therefore quote them practically in full, adding my own
comments, where necessary, in parentheses.</p>

<p>(1) &quot;Select a quiet room where you will be entirely
undisturbed, taking care that it is as far as possible free from
mirrors, ornaments, pictures, glaring colors and the like, which
may otherwise distract the attention.</p>

<p>&quot;This room should be of a comfortable temperature in
accordance with the time of year, neither too hot nor too cold.
About 60<font face="Symbol">°</font> to 65<font face="Symbol">°</font>
Fahr. is suitable in most cases, though allowance can be made for
natural differences in the temperaments of various persons. Thus
thin, nervous, delicately organized individuals, and those of
lymphatic and soft, easy-going, passive types, require a slightly
warmer apartment than the more positive class, who are known by
their <i>dark </i>eyes, hair and complexion, combined with more
prominent joints and sharper development of what phrenologists
term the Perceptive region of the forehead. Should a fire, or any
form of artificial light be necessary, it should be well screened
off, so as to prevent the light rays from being reflected in, or
in any manner directly reaching the crystal.</p>

<p>&quot;The room should not be dark, but rather shadowed, or
charged with dull light, somewhat such as prevails on a cloudy or
wet day.</p>

<p>(2) &quot;The crystal should be placed on its stand on a
table, or it may rest on a black velvet cushion, but in either
case it should be partially surrounded by a black silk or similar
wrap or screen, so adjusted as to cut off any undesirable
reflection.</p>

<p>&quot;Before beginning to experiment, remember that most
frequently nothing will be seen on the first occasion, and
possibly not for several sittings, though some sitters, if
strongly gifted with psychic powers in a state of unconscious,
and sometimes conscious degree of unfoldment, may be fortunate
enough to obtain good results at the very first trial.</p>

<p>&quot;If, therefore, nothing is perceived during<b> </b>the
first few attempts, do not despair or become impatient or imagine
that you will never see anything.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a royal road to crystal vision, but it is open
only to the compound password of Calmness, Patience,
Perseverance. If at the first attempt to ride a bicycle failure
ensues, the only way to learn is to pay attention to the
necessary rules, and to <i>persevere daily </i>until the ability
to ride comes naturally.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it is with the would-be seer. Persevere in
accordance with these simple directions, and success will sooner
or later crown your efforts.</p>

<p>(3) &quot;Commence by sitting comfortably with the eyes fixed
upon the crystal, not by a fierce stare, but with a steady, calm
gaze, for ten minutes only, on the first occasion. In taking the
time it is best to hang your watch at a distance where, while the
face is clearly visible, the ticking is rendered inaudible. When
the time is up, carefully put the crystal away in its case, and
keep it in a dark place, under lock and key, allowing no one but
yourself to handle it.&quot;</p>

<p>(The importance of this latter instruction will be clear to
those who have studied the first chapter of this present
treatise, and who have actually prepared their crystals in the
proper manner. Strange magnetism will of course have its effect
on the crystal globe, and again render necessary some such
process of Purification as already described.)</p>

<p>&quot;At the second sitting, which should be <i>at the same
place, in the same position, </i>and <i>at the same time, you </i>may
increase the length of the effort to fifteen minutes, and
continue for this period during the next five or six sittings,
after which the time may be <i>gradually </i>increased, but
should in no case exceed one hour.&quot;</p>

<p>(The first instruction in the above paragraph, relative to
place, time, etc., is given in order that the student may take
advantage of certain Cyclic Laws, which make the repetition of an
act under similar circumstances, easier with each attempt, on
account of the fact that he has begun to <i>form a habit </i>of
working.)</p>

<p>(4) &quot;Any person, or persons admitted to the room, and
allowed to remain while you sit should (a) keep absolute silence
and (b) remain seated at a distance from you.&quot;</p>

<p>(The presence of any other person is of course a handicap to
concentration of mind, and should be avoided at first. Any
movement in the room may reflect in the crystal, and thus disturb
the vision.)</p>

<p>&quot;When you have developed your latent powers, questions
may, of course, be put to you by one of those present, but even
then only in a very gentle, or low and slow tone of voice; never
suddenly, or in a forceful manner.&quot;</p>

<p>(It is far better to make the whole practice one of
self-development, and not to have people around who will ask a
lot of idle questions. Again, the soul of the seer is to some
extent thrown open during the practice, so as to make impressions
from the Higher Spheres possible, and it is quite another matter
to let other, probably ignorant, people, pump the mind of the
seer full of suggestions of a lower order, while in that
condition. Therein lies the danger of the practice.)</p>

<p>(5) &quot;When you find the crystal begins to look dull or
cloudy, with small pin points of light glittering therein, like
tiny stars, you may know that you are <i>commencing </i>to obtain
that for which you seek - viz: crystalline vision. Therefore
persevere with confidence. This condition may, or may not,
continue for several sittings, the crystal seeming at times to
alternately appear and disappear as in a mist. By and by this
hazy appearance will in its turn give place quite suddenly to a
blindness of the senses to all else but a blue or bluish ocean of
space, against which, as if it were a background, <i>the vision </i>will<i>
</i>be clearly apparent.&quot;</p>

<p>(The above is practically all the instruction necessary to the
desired result, the rest is <i>practice </i>on your part. Yet
here are a few further hints for your guidance:)</p>

<p>(6) &quot;The crystal should not be used soon after taking a
meal,<b> </b>and care should be taken in matters of diet to
partake only of digestible foods, and to avoid alcoholic
beverages. Plain and nourishing food, and outdoor exercise, with
contentment of mind, or love of simplicity of living, are great
aids to success. Mental anxiety, or ill health, are not conducive
to the desired end. Attention to <i>correct breathing is of
importance.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>(A long comment might be added on the necessity of correct
breathing, it will perhaps find a place later on in this
treatise.)</p>

<p>(7) &quot;As regards the time at which events seen will come
to pass, each seer is usually impressed with regard thereto; but
as a general rule, visions appearing in the extreme background
indicate time more remote, either past or future, than those
perceived nearer at hand, while those appearing in the forefront,
or close to the seer, denote the present, or immediate
future.&quot;</p>

<p>(This question of 'time' is an important one, and it is
unfortunate that it should largely depend on the 'hunch' of the
seer. Time on other planes is differently conditioned, or rather
since time is a mode of the human mind, and our mind is at a
different state of vibration when examining a vision, the
question arises as to the ability of the seer to translate one
set of time senses into another corresponding to a different
plane. Time in the long run, is discovered to be an illusion
after all. There is much in the warning, previously given, that
however perfect a vision may appear, it is untrue when brought
down to the material plane. More may be said on this matter
later.)</p>

<p>(8) &quot;Two principal classes of visions will present
themselves to the sitter (a) The Symbolic, indicated by the
appearance of symbols such as a flag, boat, knife, gold, etc.:
and (b) Actual Scenes and Personages, in action or
otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>(In the former instance much will depend on the ability of the
seer to translate the symbols correctly, and in the latter there
is always liable to be deception by elementals masquerading as
the persons that appear to the seer. Remember our warning about
the faked book.)</p>

<p>&quot;Persons of a Positive cast of organization, the more
active, excitable, yet decided type, are most likely to perceive
symbolically or allegorically; while those of a Passive nature
usually receive direct or literal revelations. Both classes will
find it necessary to carefully cultivate truthfulness,
unselfishness, gratitude for what is shown, and absolute
confidence in the <b>Love, Wisdom and Guidance of God </b>Himself.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">--------------</p>

<p>So ends Mr. Melville's instruction, and he displays his wisdom
in thus warning the reader of the necessity of cultivating purity
in his own Larger Crystalline Sphere and in relying on nothing
but the highest as his ultimate Guide. We shall understand this
more clearly as the work progresses, meanwhile enough has been
given to enable the would-be seer to start without further
delay-his actual practice of the Art.</p>

<p>Follow the above instructions carefully, and perform your
first ten-minute practice now, before you go any further in the
study of this treatise. Then make up your mind to do the practice
regularly <i>every day </i>till you have <i>proved for yourself </i>the
possibility of obtaining some results by this means.</p>
