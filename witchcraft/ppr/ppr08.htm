<p align="center">(<i>Assyrian</i>)</p>  
<p><DIR>BIND the sick man to Heaven, for from Earth he is being torn away!<br> Of the brave man who was so strong, his strength has departed.<br> Of the righteous servant, the force does not return,<br> In his bodily frame he lies dangerously ill.<br> But Ishtar, who in her dwelling, is grieved concerning him, descends from her mountain unvisited of men.<br> To the door of the sick man she comes.<br> The sick man listens!<br> Who is there? Who comes?<br> It is Ishtar, daughter of the Moon God!<br> Like pure silver may his garment be shining white!<br> Like brass may he be radiant!<br> To the Sun, greatest of the gods, may he ascend!<br> And may the Sun, greatest of the gods, receive his soul into his holy hands!</DIR></p>
