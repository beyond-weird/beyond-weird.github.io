</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PRAYER OF THE MAIZE</h3>  
<p align="center">(<i>Mexican</i>)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">(This is a conventional ceremony where a high priest, masked, personates Kin-teotl, god of the maize. An altar priest chants of the loves and greatness of the gods, but with an earthly love in his heart for a vestal who personates the goddess of art in a similar ceremony at the adjacent temple of Cholula)</FONT></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Priest</i></p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">(Placing flowers of the field on shrine)</FONT></p>  
<p>THE FLOWER in my heart blossoms, sweetness it brings in the night!</p>  
<p>Our mother has loved. The goddess of love has scattered flowers of fragrance!"</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Kin-teotl</i></p>  
<p>"I, Kin-teotl, god of the grain, am as a flower--a flower ever renewing!"</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Priest</i></p>  
<p>"Kin-teotl was born from the water, he came as a mortal, as a youth, from the cerulean home of the fishes, an ever new, glorious god!</p>  
<p>He shone as the sun; his mother dwelt in the House of the Dawn!"</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Kin-teotl</i></p>  
<p>"I come forth on the earth--even to the market place like a mortal--even I--great and glorious!</p>  
<p>Be ye happy under the flower bush varied in hue as the quetzal bird; Listen to the quechol singing to the gods! Listen to the singing of the quechol along the river:--hear its flute along the river in the home of the reeds!"</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">(The flutes sound the call of the birds as Kin-teotl disappears in the temple followed by the devotees)</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Priest</i></p>  
<p>"Ai!--would that my altar flowers would cease from dying! Our flesh is as flowers--even as flowers in the place of the flowers.</p>  
<p>She goes to the mart! As goddess they carry her to the mart! She speaks at Cholula--she startles my heart! She startles my heart!</p>  
<p>"Ai! for joy the high priest is there at her shrine! Where merchants sell the ear rings of green jade, she is to be seen by men--in the Place of Wonders she is to be seen!</p>  
<p>Sleep, sleep, sleep! I fold my hands to sleep!</p>  
<p>I, O Woman!--sleep!"</p>
