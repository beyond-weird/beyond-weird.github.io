<H2>The Third Head</H2>
<H3>Which is the last Part of this Work. How the Process is to be Concluded by the Pronouncement of a Definite and Just Sentence</H3></CENTER>
 
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HAVING by the grace of God 
examined the proper means of arriving at a knowledge of the heresy of 
witchcraft, and having shown how the process on behalf of the faith should be 
initiated and proceeded with, it remains to discuss how that process is to be 
brought to a fitting termination with an appropriate sentence.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Here it is to be noted that this heresy, as was shown in the beginning of this 
Last Part, is not to be confused with other simple heresies, since it is 
obvious that it is not a pure and single crime, but partly ecclesiastical and 
partly civil. Therefore in dealing with the methods of passing sentence, we 
must first consider a certain kind of sentence to which witches are in the 
habit of appealing, in which the secular judge can act on his own account 
independently of the Ordinary. Secondly, we shall consider those in which he 
cannot act without the Ordinary. And so thirdly it will be shown how the 
Ordinaries can discharge themselves of their duties.
