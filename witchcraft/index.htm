<p><span class="p-small2"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Neopaganism covers a 
wide range of belief systems which have emerged in the past 50 years, primarily 
in the UK, Europe, and the United States. This includes the better known Wicca, 
which is a synthesis of traditions from the British Isles, as well as many less 
visible groups which draw inspiration from other parts of the world.</font></span></p>

<A HREF="gbos/index.htm">The Gardnerian Book of Shadows</A><BR>
<span class="p-small2">
The Book of Shadows is a Wiccan text which is maintained by the initiated in
manuscript form, and contains description of rituals, spells, and other
knowledge.
This tradition was carried on by Gerald Gardner, who (depending on the
account) either synthesized Wicca, or took it public, during the 1950s.</span></font></P>

Were there ever <I>real</I> witches?
If not, what were all the witch trials about?
And how about those fairies?
Murray tries to answer these and other questions objectively with
plenty of documentary evidence.
She is often cited as a primary source for Gerald Gardners' ideology.

By Sir Walter Scott [1885].
This book by the 19th Century
novelist covers much of the same
evidence as Murry (albeit in a more popular style).
Scott draws few conclusions other than
that our ancestors were extremely superstitious.</span></font></p>

<span class="p-small2">
<br>
By James Bonwick [1894].
This book reflects a scholarly perspective on the Druids.
It ties together many strands of mythology and anthroplogy
to shed light on Irish Paganism.

<span class="p-small2">
<br>
By W. Winwood Reade [1861].&nbsp;
This book is fairly typical of the mid-19th Century literature about Druidry,
which had some romantic misconceptions about the Druids.
For instance, we now know that the builders of Stonehenge
preceded the historical Celts by many centuries.

<span class="p-small2">
From the 14th to the 17th Century a hysteria spread across Europe
which involved torturing and executing people based on accusations
that they were witches.
Whether any actual practitioners of a pre-Christian pagan tradition were
persecuted as the result of a witch trial is up for debate.
These books and texts are period documents which illustrate
the methods, rationale (such as it was) and history of this persecution.</span></font></P>
