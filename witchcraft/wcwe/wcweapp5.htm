<P>
As noted in the text, several of the ingredients listed here are DEADLY POISONS.
Some of these ingredients can KILL YOU simply through SKIN CONTACT.
We include this appendix because it is an integral part of the original text
of the book <I>the Witch-Cult in Western Europe</I>.
We do not recommend attempting to duplicate this formula or using ANY
of the ingredients in this formula. NOTE: sacred-texts.com will not
be held responsible for the outcome of anyone attempting to
use this formula or any of these ingredients. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.

Here is a quote from an interview with
Sharon Devlin, an experienced wiccan herbalist,
from the book <I>Drawing Down the Moon</I> by Margot Adler:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"One day I decided to make a flying ointment. I was doing it in front
of a student who I wanted to impress. Well, I made it about a thousand-fold
stronger than I should have because I was using denatured alcohol
instead of sprits of wine to extract it, which is what they did in
the old days.  And instead of lard I was using hydrophilic ointment.
As a result I increased the potency about two hundred to three hundred
percent, and I got enough under my fingernails just by mixing it to kill me.
And I would have died if it hadn't been for a friend of mine who was
a doctor and a magician, whom I called immediately.  I learned a very
heavy lesson.  It was my first heavy experience with death, and a lot
of bullshit pride went down the toilet with the rest of the flying ointment."

<hr color="#000000">
<P>THE three formulae for the 'flying' ointment used by witches are as follows:</P>
<P>1. Du persil, de l'eau de l'Aconite, des feuilles de Peuple, et de la suye.</P>
<P>2. De la Berle, de l'Acorum vulgaire, de la Quintefeuille, du sang de chauuesouris, 
  de la Morelle endormante, et de l'huyle.</P>
<P>3. De graisse d'enfant, de suc d'Ache, d'Aconite, de Quintefeuille, de Morelle, 
  et de suye.</P>
<P>These formulae may be translated as follows -</P>
<P>1. Parsley, water of aconite, poplar leaves, and soot.</P>
<P>2. Water parsnip, sweet flag, cinquefoil, bat's blood, deadly night. shade, 
  and oil.</P>
<P>3. Baby's fat, juice of water parsnip, aconite, cinquefoil, deadly nightshade, 
  and soot.</P>
<P>These prescriptions show that the society of witches had a very creditable 
  knowledge of the art of poisoning: aconite and deadly nightshade or belladonna 
  are two of the three most poisonous plants growing freely in Europe, the third 
  is hemlock, and in all probability 'persil' refers to hemlock and not to the 
  harmless parsley, which it resembles closely.</P>
<P>The other ingredients have no marked toxic action, unless 'berle' and 'ache' 
  refer not to the harmless water parsnip but to the poisonous water hemlock or 
  cowbane. The baby's fat and bat's blood would of course have no action.</P>
<P>Aconite was one of the best-known poisons in ancient times; indeed it was so 
  extensively used by professional poisoners in Rome during the Empire that a 
  law was passed making its cultivation a capital offence. Aconite root contains 
  about 0.4 percent of alkaloid and one-fifteenth of a grain of the alkaloid is 
  a lethal dose. The drug has little effect upon the consciousness, but produces 
  slowing, irregularity, and finally arrest of the heart.</P>
<P>The use of belladonna as a poison was also known in classical times; fourteen 
  of the berries have been known to produce death; a moderate dose will produce 
  wild excitement and delirium.</P>
<P>Hemlock is also a well-known and ancient poison; the fruit may contain as much 
  as 0.9 per cent. of alkaloid, and ¼ grain of the alkaloid may produce death. 
  The action of hemlock usually is to produce a gradual motor paralysis, consciousness 
  being unimpaired, and death being caused by paralysis of respiration, but sometimes 
  hemlock may produce delirium and excitement.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, therefore, about the efficacy of these prescriptions and 
  their ability to produce physiological effects. They were administered by being 
  rubbed into the skin, which is not an efficient way of introducing most drugs 
  into the body, indeed some have denied that alkaloids can be absorbed from the 
  unbroken skin; but there is no doubt that alkaloids can be absorbed when rubbed 
  into scratches or into the quick of the nails, and it must be remembered that 
  an unbroken skin is only possessed by those who are free from vermin and who 
  wash regularly, and neither of these conditions would be likely to apply to 
  a mediaeval witch. Cases of poisoning associated with delirium have actually 
  been recorded following the application of belladonna plasters to the skin.</P>
<P>Of the three prescriptions the first is a watery solution and would not be 
  very efficacious when rubbed into the skin, but the second and third are ointments, 
  and if they were rubbed into the skin in sufficient quantities definite physiological 
  results would be produced.</P>
<P>The first preparation, which contains hemlock and aconite, would produce mental 
  confusion, impaired movement, irregular action of the heart, dizziness and shortness 
  of breath.</P>
<P>The belladonna in the second ointment would produce excitement which might 
  pass into delirium.</P>
<P>The third ointment, containing both aconite and belladonna, would produce excitement 
  and irregular action of the heart.</P>
<P>I cannot say whether any of these drugs would produce the impression of flying, 
  but I consider the use of aconite interesting in this respect. Irregular action 
  of the heart in a person falling asleep produces the well-known sensation of 
  suddenly falling through space, and it seems quite possible that the combination 
  of a delirifacient like belladonna with a drug producing irregular action of 
  the heart like aconite might produce the sensation of flying.</P>
