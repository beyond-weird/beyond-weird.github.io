<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">I. CONTINUITY OF THE RELIGION</H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">OF the ancient religion of pre-Christian 
  Britain there are few written records, but it is contrary to all experience 
  that a cult should die out and leave no trace immediately on the introduction 
  of a new religion. The so-called conversion of Britain meant the conversion 
  of the rulers only; the mass of the people continued to follow their ancient 
  customs and beliefs with a veneer of Christian rites. The centuries brought 
  a deepening of Christianity which, introduced from above, gradually penetrated 
  downwards through one class after another. During this process the laws against 
  the practice of certain heathen rites became more strict as Christianity grew 
  in power, the Church tried her strength against 'witches' in high places and 
  was victorious, and in the fifteenth century open war was declared against the 
  last remains of heathenism in the famous Bull of Innocent VIII.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">This heathenism was practised only 
  in certain places and among certain classes of the community. In other places 
  the ancient ritual was either adopted into, or tolerated by, the Church; and 
  the Maypole dances and other rustic festivities remained as survivals of the 
  rites of the early cult.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Whether the religion which survived 
  as the witch cult was the same as the religion of the Druids, or whether it 
  belonged to a still earlier stratum, is not clear. Though the descriptions, 
  of classical authors are rather too vague and scanty to settle such a point, 
  sufficient remains to show that a fertility cult did once exist in these islands, 
  akin to similar cults in the ancient world. Such rites would not he suppressed 
  by the tribes who entered Great Britain after the withdrawal of the Romans; 
  a continuance of the cult may therefore be expected among the people whom the 
  Christian missionaries laboured to convert.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">As the early historical records of 
  these islands were made by Christian ecclesiastics, allowance must be made for 
  the religious bias of the writers, which caused them to make Christianity appear 
  as the only religion existing at the time. But though the historical records 
  are silent on the subject the laws and enactments of the different communities, 
  whether lay or ecclesiastical, retain very definite evidence of the continuance 
  of the ancient cults.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">In this connexion the dates of the 
  conversion of England are instructive, The following table gives the principal 
  dates:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">597-604. Augustine's mission. London 
  still heathen. Conversion of &AElig;thelbert, King of Kent. After &AElig;thelbert's 
  death Christianity suffered a reverse.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">604. Conversion of the King of the 
  East Saxons, whose successor lapsed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">627. Conversion of the King of Northumbria.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">628. Conversion of the King of East 
  Anglia.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">631-651. Aidan's missions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">635. Conversion of the King of Wessex.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">653. Conversion of the King of Mercia.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">654. Re-conversion of the King of 
  the East Saxons.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">681. Conversion of the King of the 
  South Saxons.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">An influx of heathenism occurred on 
  two later occasions in the ninth century there was an invasion by the heathen 
  Danes under Guthrum; and in the eleventh century the heathen king Cnut led his 
  hordes to victory, As in the case of the Saxon kings of the seventh century, 
  Guthrum and Cnut were converted and the tribes followed their leaders' example, 
  professed Christianity, and were baptized.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">But it cannot be imagined that these 
  wholesale conversions were more than nominal in most cases, though the king's 
  religion was outwardly the tribe's religion. If, as happened among the East 
  Saxons, the king forsook his old gods, returned to them again, and finally forsook 
  them altogether, the tribe followed his lead, and, in public at least, worshipped 
  Christ, Odin, or any other deity whom the king favoured for the moment; but 
  there can be hardly any doubt that in private the mass of the people adhered 
  to the old religion to which they were accustomed. This tribal conversion is 
  clearly marked when a heathen king married a Christian queen, or vice. versa; 
  and it must also be noted that a king never changed his religion without careful 
  consultation with his chief men.[1] An example of the two religions existing 
  side by side is found in the account of Redwald, King of the East Saxons, who 
  'in the same temple had an altar to sacrifice to Christ, and another small one 
  to offer victims to devils'.[2]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">The continuity of the ancient religion 
  is proved by the references to it in the classical authors, the ecclesiastical 
  laws, and other legal and historical records.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">1st cent. Strabo, 63 B.C.-A.D. 23.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">'In an island close to Britain, Demeter 
  and Persephone are venerated with rites similar to the orgies of Samothrace.'[3]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">4th cent. Dionysius says that in islands 
  near Jersey and Guernsey the rites of Bacchus were performed by the women, crowned 
  with leaves; they danced and made an even greater shouting than the Thracians.[4]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">7th cent. Theodore, Archbishop of 
  Canterbury, 668-690.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">The <I>Liber Poenitentialis</I>[5] 
  of Theodore contains the earliest ecclesiastical laws of England. It consists 
  of a list of offences and the penance due for each offence; one whole section 
  is occupied with details of the ancient religion and of its rites. Such are:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Sacrifice to devils.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Eating and drinking in a heathen temple, 
  (a) in ignorance, (b) after being told by the [Christian] priest that it is 
  sacrilege and the table of devils, (c) as a cult of idols and in honour of idols.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">'Not only celebrating feasts in the 
  abominable places of the heathen and offering food there, but also consuming 
  it. Serving this hidden idolatry, having relinquished Christ. If anyone at the 
  kalends of January goes about as a stag or a bull; that is, making himself into 
  a wild animal and dressing in the skin of a herd animal, and putting on the 
  heads of beasts; those who in such wise transform themselves into the appearance 
  of a wild animal, penance for three years because this is devilish.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><I>Bull of Pope Innocent VIII</i>, 
  1481,<BR>
  'It has come to our ears that numbers of both sexes do not avoid to have intercourse 
  with demons, Incubi and Succubi; and that by their sorceries, and by their incantations, 
  charms, and conjurations, they suffocate, extinguish, and cause to perish the 
  births of women, the increase of animals, the corn of the ground, the grapes 
  of the vineyard and the fruit of the trees, as well as men, women, flocks, herds, 
  and other various kinds of animals, vines and apple trees, grass, corn and other 
  fruits of the earth; making and procuring that men and women, flocks and herds 
  and other animals shall suffer and be tormented both from within and without, 
  so that men beget not, nor women conceive; and they impede the conjugal action 
  of men and women.'</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">It will be seen by the foregoing that 
  so far from the Bull of Pope Innocent VIII being the beginning of the 'outbreak 
  of witchcraft ', as so many modern writers consider, it is only one of many 
  ordinances against the practices of an earlier cult. It takes no account of 
  the effect of these practices on the morals of the people who believed in them, 
  but lays stress only on their power over fertility; the fertility of human beings, 
  animals, and crops. In short it is exactly the pronouncement which one would 
  expect from a Christian against a heathen form of religion in which the worship 
  of a god of fertility was the central idea. It shows therefore that the witches 
  were considered to deal with fertility only.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Looked upon in the light of a fertility 
  cult, the ritual, of the witches becomes comprehensible. Originally for the 
  promotion of fertility, it became gradually degraded into a method for blasting 
  fertility, and thus the witches who had been once the means of bringing prosperity 
  to the people and the land by driving out all evil influences, in process of 
  time were looked upon as being themselves the evil influences, and were held 
  in horror accordingly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">The actual feelings of the witches 
  towards their religion have been recorded in very few cases, but they can be 
  inferred from the few records which remain. The earliest example is from Lorraine 
  in 1408, 'lequel m&eacute;fait les susdites dames disoient et confessoient avoir 
  endur&eacute; &agrave; leur contentement et saoulement de plaisir que n'avoient 
  eu onc de leur vie en tel pourchas'.[1] De Lancre took a certain amount of trouble 
  to obtain the opinions of the witches, whereby he was obviously scandalized.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">'Vne sorciere entre autres fort insigne

  ne se repentent, &amp; meurent obstinees en leur mechancet&eacute;'.[2]</FONT></P>

  <I>I will not be other than I am; I find too much content in my Condition</I>.'[3] 
  Though the English and Scotch witches' opinions are not reported, it is clear 
  from the evidence that they were the same as those of the Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, 
  for not only did they join of their own free will but in many cases there seems 
  to have been no need of persuasion. In a great number of trials, when the witches 
  acknowledged that they had been asked to become members of the society, there 
  follows an expression of this sort, 'ye freely and willingly accepted and granted 
  thereto'. And that they held -to their god as firmly as those de Lancre put 
  to death is equally evident in view of the North Berwick witches, of Rebecca 
  West and Rose Hallybread, who 'dyed very Stuburn, and Refractory without any 
  Remorss, or seeming Terror of Conscience for their abominable Witch-craft';[4] 
  Major Weir, who perished as a witch, renouncing all hope of heaven;[5] and the 
  Northampton witches, Agnes Browne and her daughter, who 'were never heard to 
  pray, or to call vppon God, never asking pardon for their offences either of
