<b>THE TRUE GREATER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM </b><br>
As the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram places the Magician on the Path of Samech, so this Greater Ritual <br>
places him on the Path of Gimel above, instead of below  Tiphareth. <br>
Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and annoint body with Holy Oil before performing this <br>
Greater Ritual of the Pentagram. <br>
   <br>
Take up your position facing the West, strike the bell once <br>
and  cry aloud Abrahadabra!  giving the Threefold Sign of Enterer (Horus), Silence (Harpocrates), and <br>
Apophis (Set Triumphant). Whirl around as on a pivot as rapidly as you can with the Wand or Sword <br>
outstretched, thus making a magick circle. Then say, with all the exaltation possible: <br>
 The light is mine; its rays consume me: <br>
I have made a secret door into the House of Ra (Enterer towards East) and Tum (Enterer towards West), of <br>
Khephra (Enterer towards North) and of Ahathoor (Enterer towards South). <br>
(In centre, facing West, in Sign of Silence) <br>
I am thy Theban, O Mentu, The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu! Bell. <br>
 Turning 60 degrees to your left, make the inverted Invoking Pentagram of Fire and cry NUIT. <br>
Turning 60 degrees to your original right (i.e. to the North of West) make the same Pentagram and cry <br>
HADIT. <br>
Turn to the East, make the same Pentagram and cry <br>
RA-HOOR-KHUIT. <br>
Then turn 60 degrees North of East, make the erect Invoking Pentagram of Fire and cry BES-NA-MAUT. <br>
Then  turn  60  degrees  South of East, make  the same Pentagram  and cry  TA-NECH. <br>
Then to the West, make the same Pentagram and cry <br>
ANKH-AF-NA-KHONSU. <br>
 Seat yourself with your hands on your knees, like an enthroned Egyptian God, or stand in the Sign of Hoor-<br>
Paar-Kraat.Say slowly, and very forcibly, in a low voice: <br>
Ardent and awful on my right <br>
Rage Ratziel and Tzadkiel. <br>
Red Raphael on his burning throne <br>
Guards me behind:  with magian might <br>
Dread Khamael and Tzaphkiel <br>
War on my left:  the avengers own Before me flaming out alone The Majesty of Metatron! <br>
For around me in six several ways The fivefold sword-stars beat and blaze; <br>
While in the column shines and slays The star that hath eleven rays. <br>
Abrahadabra! <br>
Bell. <br>
Rise and give the Threefold Sign, remaining in the Sign of Apophis- Typhon to invoke whatever force thou <br>
wishest to invoke. <br>
<hr>
<A name=4></a>Bell <br>
 Repeat all of part I, and then forcibly say: <br>
By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat; <br>
By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell. <br>
Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit! <br>
Bid me within thine House to dwell, O winged Snake of Light, Hadit! <br>
Abide with me Ra-Hoor-Khuit! <br>
 <br>
NTES <br>
This Pentagram Ritual is combined openly with the Hexagram, for the secret formulation of Abrahadabra. <br>
The Hexagram is arranged differently on the Tree, to correspond with Kether (highest top point), Chokmah <br>
(top-right), Binah (top-left), Chesed (bottom-right), Geburah (bottom-left) and Tiphareth (lowest bottom <br>
point). Keep in mind that this Ritual is done on the Path of Gimel. When making Pentagrams and vibrating <br>
Names in this Rite you are also formulating the Hexagram. Thus: <br>
Nuit = Binah <br>
Hadit = Chokmah <br>
Ra-Hoor-Khuit = Tiphareth <br>
Bes-Na-Maut = Chesed <br>
Ta-Nech = Geburah <br>
Ankh-af-na-khonsu = Kether <br>
 Note that Bes-Na-Maut and Ta-Nech are the parents of Ankh-af-na-khonsu. These are lesser forms of Nuit <br>
and Hadit. Ankh-af-na-khonsu of course has a direct relationship to Ra-Hoor-Khuit; he is the physical <br>
incarnation of that God. <br>
Crowley remarked that this Ritual is not satisfactory unless there be a properly constructed Circle marked <br>
with the Hexagram and Six Lamps. <br>
He further stated that this Ritual is neither perfect nor inspired.--- <br>
