<h2>Aleister Crowley's diary and notes 25th March 1900 to 18th April 1900</h2>

 <I><B>Sunday</I></B> <i>{March 25th, 1900 e.v.?}</i>:<DD>

    12.10 A.M.  I have invoked <i>{Coptic: God presiding over the Earth of Water 
  Castle in Enochian Chess, evidently same as Egyptian "Shu".  See note on 
  page 141 in <I><B>Liber 777</I></B> 2nd revision, Chico edition, to col. XX.}</i> as I never 
  invoked before.  First L<i>(esser)</i> B<i>(anishing)</i> R<i>(itual of the)</i> Pentagram. 
  Vibrate Shin-Dalet-Yod Aleph-Lamed Chet-Yod with S. from R., then inv<i>(oke){initial letter of the 
  above Coptic deity name, H.R.H.R.C. TS gives "Shu" and omits the first 
  sentence.}</i> impromptu, and assumed his form and attributes.  Charged 
  tel<i>(esma)</i> by <I><B>will</I></B> and sealed by K.A.P. <i>(?K.A.D.)</i> R and C by lamp and lo!  I 
  saw you to the end.  Now for the vision.<DD>

     I fancy I must have got too active: I saw little, and fell asleep.  But 
  my dreams were all that they should be.<DD>
     An idea that the planetary, etc., influence at time of waking determines 
  dreams.<br>
  <I><B>Monday</I></B>:  Trouble getting P.W.  Shu vision cut off by sleep.<br>
  <I><B>Tuesday</I></B>:  Ski on Hills.<br>
  <I><B>Wednesday</I></B>:  Revise climbing paper with O.E<i>(ckenstein)</i>.  Dreams much better 
  all this time.<br>

  <I><B>Thursday</I></B>:  I had gone to sleep meditating L.V.X. and woke v<i>{ery}</i> early still 
  doing this [Curious dreams of prison-breaking - eventual arrival at 
  Eastbourne - regatta - tendency to Eastbournehabits.]<br>
  Now L. Yod = <img src = "/images/virgb.gif" alt = "Virgo"> Lamed = <img src = "/images/librab.gif" alt = "Libra"> and HICES = Moon.  On Tree Does V = and Teth = 
  serpent --<br>
  V = <img src = "/images/scorpb.gif" alt = "Scorpio"> as rebirth <i>(Phoenix Wand)</i>  X = Samech and Osiris<br>

  <i>(Note.  In pencil on opposite side of note-book.  L, sowing seed.  V, 
  apparent corruption, X, resurrection)</i>.   Now I think there is a change of god-form here connoted.  Chief Adept with 
  wand = Thoouth or HICES <i>{<I><B>777</I></B> Ibid. Water of Earth Queen}</i> with Crook and 
  Scourge = <i>{Coptic: <I><B>777</I></B> Ibid. Spirit of Earth King}</i>.  Second Adept would be 
  HOOR or <i>{Coptic: <I><B>777</I></B> Ibid. Earth of Earth Castle}</i> or more obviously Apophis. 
  The question is whether Apophis is not only the evil dyad: but the dual 
  nature.  I clearly get the pyramid formula of attracting light.  Yet the 
  manner of vibration is difficult.  <i>(Added later in pencil "Closing of plumes 
  of Amoun")</i>.  There is a great equilibration of officers: and they seem to 
  overlap and interchange.  Thus S. has sword sacred to Osiris and T. to Isis 
  while C. has the Caduceus.  Yet in function are the officers very similar to<br> 
  0<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 0<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif">.<br>

  <I><B>Friday</I></B>:  Another useless day.<br>
  <I><B>Saturday</I></B>: Either Thursday or Friday night I dreamt of beginning the 
  Operation, and of some obstacle on the second day.<DD>
    Heard this evening from Deodate.  S.O.<i>(Second Order)</i> apparently mad. 
  Resolved to write to D.D.C.F. <i>(Mathers)</i> offering myself.  I invoke Yod-Koph-Dalet-Yod-Aleph-Lamed to 
  give me an answer in my dreams.  Got him visibly.<br>

  <I><B>Sunday</I></B> <i>{April 1st?}</i>: A most extraordinary dream!  A woman-tapir on an 
  island, and a beautiful girl and her younger sister!  Love all, latter at 
  last.  I seem to remember very little.  Anyway, what doth this portend?  I 
  leave for London Monday: as it is written: "His Face was Fixed as a Flint to 
  go unto Jerusalem".<br>
  <I><B>Monday</I></B>: Journey all day and night.<br>
  <I><B>Tuesday</I></B>: Arrive at 10 L.G.P.  Go to E.S.D.  Bring him back and trap Gnothi 
  Seauton in attempting Laura.  He seems nearly as big a blackguard as myself. 
  I misbehave as usual.  Oh Lord, how long?<br>
  <I><B>Wednesday</I></B>:  To V.N. <i>(G.C.Jones)</i><br>

  <I><B>Thursday</I></B>: Why, they haven't got the 4 scales! <i>(Refers I think to a G.D. MSS 
  on the four scales of colour.)</i><br>
  <I><B>Friday</I></B>: V.N. Kicks me out [as S.S.D.D. <i>(Florence Farr.)</i> will visit him?] 
  C.S. comes in evening.<br>
  <I><B>Saturday</I></B>: Find Vault locked <i>(the G.D. Temple)</i>.  See M.W.Th <i>(Blackden)</i>.  V.N. 
  wires.  D.D.C.F.'s <i>(Mathers)</i> letter forwarded to me.  Fidelis <i>(Elane 
  Simpson)</i> appoints Sunday morning.  D.D.C.F. accepts my services.<br>

  <i>(Note. On opposite page a Tarot divination "Shall I go to london re S<i>(econd)</i> 
  O<i>(rder)</i>?  Fortune and hope to the Universe.  The Imperator?  The fortune of 
  the Imperator will change.  Hope that reconcilement will avert destruction 
  by fire.  The U<i>(niverse)</i> shall be led to the Initiatrix to the Sun." 
  Another divination on the next page.  "Good fortune and unexpected help in 
  the matter.  The strife inspires a change.  An involuntary change finally 
  decides for glory, gain etc.")</i>.<br>
  Therefore do I rejoice, that my sacrifice is accepted.  Therefore do I again 
  postpone the Operation of Abramelin the Mage, having by God's Grace 
  formulated even in this a new link with the Higher, and gained a new weapon 
  against the Great Princes of the Evil of the world.<p>

  It was told me by a V.H.Frater since resigned concerning a certain fog or

  is m. b. to obsess or vampirize.<br><center><big>

Notes on London row.<br></center>
  S.S.D.D. <i>(Florence Farr.)</i> cannot work longer with S.R.<i>(Mathers)</i>, as she 
  knows he is definitely working against England, and using o<i>(dd?)</i> b<i>(rethren?)</i> 
  of O<i>(rder)</i> for this end.  C.S. = LLB<br><center><big>

                                               ----<br></big></center>
  20 Jan 1900.  V.N. <i>(G.C.Jones)</i> hears from S.R.<i>(Mathers)</i> that S.S.D.D. 
  <i>(Florence Farr)</i> wants Isis <i>(Urania Temple in London)</i> close.  L<i>(evavi)</i> 
  O<i>(culos)(Bullock)</i> confirms as S<i>(econd)</i> O<i>(rder)</i> resolution.  The 3 questions 
  are put<br>

  D.D.C.F. <i>(Mathers)</i> is told "astral jar" in I<i>(sis)</i> U<i>(rania)</i> T<i>(emple)</i>.  This 
  is a lie.<br>
    Politics the real basis.<br><center><big>

                                               ----<br></big></center>
  D.D.C.F's reply "Take it or leave it!"  Will not close I<i>(sis)</i> U<i>(rania)</i> 
  T<i>(emple)</i>.<br>
  Meeting.  V.N. <i>(Jones)</i> crushes L.O. <i>(Bullock)</i>.  Vote of censure on V.N. 
  suggested. M.W.Th <i>(Mahawani Thesi. Blackden){Latin Cross symbol in text}</i> to 
  stop rowdiness.<br>

  They write again.  S.S.D.D. will continue until successor found.  Hole and 
  corner meeting arranged.  S.S.<i>(D.D.)</i> has heard from S.R. <i>(Mathers)</i> and slept 
  on it; will show it and does!  Contents secret.  V.N. has seen it.<br>
  They ask for further information and tell S.R. of "Committee".  V.N. attends 
  a meeting and they write "Please further information of circ<i>(umstances)</i> 
  Founding <i>(of)</i> O<i>(rder)</i>.<br>

  General meeting S<i>(econd)</i> O<i>(rder)</i>.  Committee gets itself elected.<br>
  Committee thinks it has power to arraign S.R. at its bar, or call on him to 
  resign <i>(as Imperator.)</i><br>
  Apparently D.D.C.F. <i>(S.R. = Mathers)</i> ipse "doubts" authenticity of M.S.S. 
  <i>(the cypher M.S. on which the rituals of the G.D. were founded.)</i><br>

  N.B. The do not approve of S<i>(apere)</i> A<i>(ude.  Wynn Westcott.)</i>.  V.N. Distrusts 
  Resurgam.<br>
  Hist<i>(orical)</i> Lecture <i>(of the G.D.)</i>  3 Alchemical Earth W.W<i>(inn)</i> W<i>(estcott)</i>  S.A. translates 
  Cipher.  <i>(Cypher states)</i> "Apply to G<i>(ermany)</i>.  They do.  G.H.S. <I><B>S.D.</I></B>A.   L.L.L. object to S<i>(apiens)</i> D<i>(ominabitur)</i> A<i>(stris. Fraulein Sprengel.)</i> when 
  dead.  O<i>(rder)</i> - T<i>(emple)</i> work contrary to practice <i>(of the German brethren 
  of whom S.D.A. a member)</i>: yet they would allow her work to go on as far as 
  <I><B>her</I></B> M.S.S. were concerned.  But <I><B>no more.</I></B>  S.R. <i>(Mathers)</i> establishes new 
  link: goes Paris.<br><center><big>

                                               ----<br></big></center>
  Another lie.  S.R.'s latest V.N.<br><center><big>
                                               ----<br></big></center>
  C.S. very shy of talking.  Undesirable class of people being admitted. 
  Thinks whole thing - everything will collapse.  They have no obligation to a 
  forger and therefore can continue on their own.  Z.2 [One of the S<i>(econd)</i> 
  O<i>(rder)</i> documents] all rot: even more than other knowledge.  Revolt scheme 
  nearly universal.<br><center><big>

                                               ----<br></big></center>
  M.W.Th <i>(Blackden)</i>.  Point merely technical - warrant etc.  Any strong lie 
  will secure his allegiance and that of many others.  D<i>(emon)</i> E<i>(est)</i> D<i>(eus)</i> 
  I<i>(niversus.  W.B.Yeats.)</i> and possibly S.S.D.D. <i>(Florence Farr.)</i>  Cipher 
  authenticity he has never heard question.  If S.R. <i>(Mathers.)</i> is not 7<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 4<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif"> 
  then there is no S<i>(econd)</i> O<i>(rder)</i> and no G<i>(olden)</i> D<i>(awn)</i> and no obligations 
  and no nuffin.  S<i>(apere)</i> A<i>(ude.  Winn Westcott)</i> yielded from fear.<p><center>

              A scheme of action proposed by P<i>(erduabo. Crowley)</i> to S.R. <i>(Mathers)</i><br>

  1. S<i>(econd)</i> O<i>(rder)</i> to be summoned at <I><B>various</I></B> times during two or three 
  days.  They find, on being admitted one by one, a masked man in authority 
  and a scribe.  These questions etc pass after pledged secrecy re the 
  interview.<br>

  a]. Are you convinced of the doctrines and knowledges received in 5<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 6<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif">?<br>
  b.i] Then their origin can spring from a pure source only?<br>
  b.ii] I degrade you to be a L of P or P of V.<br>
  c]. Are you satisfied with the logic of the statement?  Do you solemnly 
  promise to cease these unseemly disputes as to the headship of this order? 
  I for my part can assure you that from my own knowledge D.D.C.F. is really a 
  7<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 4<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif">.<br>

  d.i]. Then you will sign this paper.  It contains a solemn reaffirmation of 
  your ob<i>(ligation)</i> as a 5<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 6<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif">, slightly expanded.  Pledge to support 
  heartily the new regulations.<br>
  d.ii]. I expel you from the order.<br>
  2. The practice of masks is to be introduced.  Each member will know only 
  the member who introduced him.  Severe test of the c<i>(andidate)</i>'s moral 
  excellence - courage - earnestness - humility - refusal to do wrong - to be 
  inserted in Portal or 5<img src = "/images/degb.gif"> = 6<img src = "/images/sqrb.gif"> ritual.<br>

  3. Outer <i>(order)</i> to be summoned.  Similar regulations announced to them. 
  New pledge required - that they will not communicate the identity of anybody 
  they happen to have known to any new member.<br>
  4. Reorg<i>(anisation)</i> of O<i>(rder)</i>.<br><center><big>

  Fidelis and Perseverantia <i>(just back)</i>.  Will affirm authority of chief - 
  demand opening of rooms etc.  Will aid chief in any way, placing their time 
  <i>(or that of Fidelis in particular)</i> at D.D.C.F.'s disposal.  Resurgam said to 
  hold similar views.  But Perseveratia opposes him on astral <i>(Lake Harris)</i>.<br>

  If he cannot get them, wire S.R. <i>(Mathers.)</i><br>

  <I><B>Friday</I></B>: Left Paris on this business.  Cab lamps catch fire.  Slight trouble 
  at first with Perseverantia: so put her through questions.  Ditto Resurgam. 
  Slept Paddington Hotel.  Runaway horse.  Fidelis' fire has refused to burn.<br>

  <I><B>Saturday</I></B>: Rose-Cross whitened.  Rubber macintosh nowhere near the fire 
  catches light.<br>
  Fire not too anxious to burn.<br>
  Perseverantia informs me of the real charge against me.  This is "sex- 
  intemperance on Lake Harris lines in order to obtain magical power <i>(both 
  sexes are here connoted)</i>"!!!<br>
  I had a long dream re. Horos lot.  They were at Boleskine and wanted to get 
  some one M.S.<br>
  I had nobody I could trust at all and it was Hell and Tommy for a long 
  while.  The end tragic for them.<br>

  <I><B>Sunday</I></B>: Sent Aubery Grahame to M.W.Th <i>(Blackden)</i> with letter<br>
  <I><B>Monday</I></B>: Saw landlord <i>(of Isis Urania Temple lodge room.)</i> and convinced him. 
  Saw Fidelis and arranged final details capture of Vault.  Engaged chucker- 
  out at a public house in Leichester Square.<br>
    In the morning I was very badly obsessed and entirely lost my temper -- 
  utterly without reason or justification.  5 times at least horses have 
  bolted at sight of me <i>{Remember what Crowley was wearing at the time! -- 
  ED}</i>.  Horse bolted with Fidelis on Saturday night.  Fires at 15 R.R. refuse 
  utterly to burn.<br>

  <I><B>Tuesday</I></B>: Recaptured vault.  Suspended Cracknell, H. et S. and S.S.D.D. came. 
  Fight.  Police.  Victory.<br>
  <I><B>Wednesday</I></B><i>{April 18th, 1900 e.v.?}</i>:  Letters sent off.<br><center><big>
