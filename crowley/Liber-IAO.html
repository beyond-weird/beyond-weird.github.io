   <p>Analysis and comprehension of formulas the matter 
is far from simple. Magic formulas, they are the secret names of 
god, were always considered incomprehensible. But if 
it cannot be approach the essence of magic formula by means of the 
reflection above its manifestation in the creation of human spirit, we
can be touched the inexpressible essence of magic formulas. 
   <p>God creates the universe by means of the word. This 
idea, undoubtedly, is really archetype, since it appeared in 
 different ways and is in no way connected to cultures. Hindus, Jews, 
gnostics, Christians, manifest surprising unanimity in this. 
   <p>God creates the universe from chaos. It means, its 
secret names are spokesmen, the certain original laws, which organize 
the space of spirit and material. The utterance of name is 
actuating of this law. But since macrocosm and microcosm are 
united, the same laws, act in the space of microcosm, i.e., human 
psyche. 
   <p>The determination of magic formulas in Krouli most 
corresponds to the Yungians determination of archetype. Many
frequently confuse gods with the archetypes, but this is not entirely 
correct, since the gods - essence of the manifestation of archetype, 
i.e., archetype means, whereas magic formulas are an 
expression of original archetype. I.e., it is possible to say 
that the magic formulas are too complex to understand, other than by gods. 
   <p>Gods clearly correspond to ways on the tree - meditate 
on them, it is simple - sufficient to use correspondences Liber 777, 
and with the presence of perseverance, force and some knowledge, 
understanding will occur. But as to understand magic formula, 
heart of gods, word of "secret and inexpressible god", which are 
almost so inexpressible. 
   <p>The Yungians determination of archetype, completely 
can be applied to the magic formula: "archetype in itself is 
certain (Word Unknown - nepredstavimyy), it is clearly factor, certain disposition, 
which at some moment of the development of human spirit comes in the 
action, <i>beginning to erect the material of 
consciousness into the specific figures</i>. They 
frequently ask me, from where archetype is taken, it is acquired or 
not. To answer these questions directly I cannot. Regarding 
archetypes be the certain factors and the motives, which order and 
which erect mental elements into the known means (calling by 
archetype), but is done this so that to recognize them is 
possible only on the effect produced by them. They exist 
(Word Unknown - predsoznatel'no) and supposedly, are formed the structural dominants of
mental generally. <i>It is possible to compare them 
with invisible beings present in the mother liquor crystal 
lattice</i>. From an empirical point of view the 
archetype never appeared within the framework of organic life. 
<i>It appeared together with the life</i>"(K.Yung, the dictionary of analytical psychology). 
   <p>Thus, any manifestations in the mental and spiritual plan 
are archetype means, whereas archetype is the invisible source 
of this manifestation and organizes chaos into the certain structure. 
In these positions we see the special relationship of the idea 
of archetype and magic formula in the manner that was understood by
Alister Of krouli.  
   <p>In the history of magic, Krouli was first, who 
attempted to comprehend the essence of magic formulas by means of 
conducting of parallels and kabbala calculations. In 
this his method occurs similar to the practice of amplification, 
analytical psychology, when the search for close and parallel values 
makes it possible to be touched the invisible nucleus of analytical 
psychology. 
   <p>In the "magics in the theory and in practice" Krouli gives
the analysis of key magic formulas, direction for the analysis and 
amplifications are assigned, but in this direction the unlimited 
freedom for a study remains. 
   <p>In this work I would want to reveal essence of one of the 
magic formulas, after tracing, as it is manifested in the life of 
human spirit - from the highest philosophy to the most commonplace 
levels, to which we do not turn attention. 
   <p>First of all, let us be turned to the "magics into the 
theory and in practice". Which the basic essence of formula IAO?
At the very beginning of chapter Krouli it writes the following:
"these are the original and most characteristic formula Of 
osirisa, the formula of the atonement of humanity. I - these are
Isida, or nature, ruined BY A - by Apopom- destroyer - and revived By 
osirisom ". Let us focus attention on the ordinal number of 
chapter - five, although formula IAO is ternary, on its spirit, it is 
active, man formula, therefore it is correlated with the fifth lasso 
of container - Iyerofantom.
   <p>Being the formula of meditation, it represents three 
natural periods: <i>"at the sources of meditative 
practice always lie calm enjoyment, quiet process of natural increase.
Meditiruyushchiy is lively interested in its work; it 
seems light; to begin it - one pleasure. This stage 
presents Isidu. Ho sooner or later it follows depression - this 
dark Hoc6 showers, infinite fatigue and aversion to the work. 
Even simplest and lung action becomes almost impracticable. 
This weakness fills soul by fear and desperation. The 
force of this aversion hardly is intelligible for those, who it did 
not survive. This is the period Of apopa. The alchemists 
teach on the same. The initial product, with which they work - 
basic and simplest; however, "natural". After a lapse of 
different stages appears "black dragon"; but from it grows pure 
and perfect gold "</i>.

<p>In "8 lectures on the yogi" Krouli enlarge understanding 
this formula, giving the concrete example: <i>"make it 
possible to me for some time to be distracted and to turn to the fact 
that I spoke in my book about magic with respect to formula IAO. 
This formula includes entire knowledge. You begin from the
glad sensations as child with the new toy, they become then boringly, 
and you attempt to break it. Ho the clever child has scientific 
position with respect to the toy, then it will not begin to break it. 
You will traverse the stage of boredom and will be raised from 
the tortures of hell to the state of the revival, when toy becomes 
god, it reveals to you its deepest secrets and it becomes the active 
part of your life. Het are more than that immaturity, wild 
opposition to pain and enjoyment. New knowledge is mastered 
"</i>. 
   <p>Thus, formula IAO, is applicable practically to any form 
of knowledge. For example, the stage of this formula can pass 
friends or enamored ones, when the admiration, based on the mutual 
idealized projections, (phase I) changes boredom and the 
disappointment, when the means of partner becomes unrealistic, but 
already in the negative aspect (phase A) and only in those, who will 
find in itself forces to accept their shadow and shadow of close one, 
it is possible to enter the phase of the ripe relations, based on the 
real knowledge and understanding of each other. 
   <p>Human history passes the same phases, to what is focused 
attention To krouli. The first phase - phase I, it presents 
phase, to infantile reality and maximum naturalism, phase A is 
correlated with the Christian era of suffering, fragmentation, when 
the idea of sufferings became the prevailing idea of culture. 
Phase o is fallen to the new, recently begun postkhristianskuyu 
era the mountain, when humanity at long last proved to be to 
preparedly perceive integral vision. It does not be worthwhile 
to be flattered on this score, let us recall that, in the opinion Of 
krouli before era mountain will enter into its rights, must pass five 
hundred years "dark it is age-long". 
   <p>It is interesting that the formula IAO in the projection 
on the history is encountered in analytical psychology of almost 
constant, although any acquaintance of Young with the works Of krouli 
is excluded:  
   <p>"about the peace of the father:
   <br><i></i><i>"Mir of father symbolizes the epoch, which is 
characterized by the protoplastic unity with entire nature".
   <br>"... to this epoch are alien critical judgment and moral 
conflict". "it reflects... the state of man in the 
childhood"</i>.
    <p>On the peace of the son:
   <br><i></i><i>"this peace is full of tendency toward the rescuing and 
toward that state of perfection, in which the man preserved unity with
the father. He in the melancholy is examined to the peace of 
father, but this peace is forever lost, because the irreversible 
increase in the consciousness of man in the past took place and it 
made its independent variable ".
   <br>"the stage of son reflects conflict situation chiefly... 
Freedom from the law aggravates oppositions "</i>.
    <p>On the peace of the holy spirit:
   <br><i></i><i>"approximation to the third stage (holy spirit) assumes 
even if not real subordination to unconscious, then, in any case, a 
kind of its recognition... Exactly as passage from the first 
stage to the second requires refusal of the children's dependence, so 
also passage to the third stage it requires refusal of the exceptional
independence "</i>. (K.Yung, The answer To Job)
   <p>The fact that Krouli identifies the first phase 
with the phase of mother, and Young with the phase of father, must not
us deceive - united it here remains that the fact that ego in this 
phase is in the idealistic state of original paradise. Young 
rests on the heritage Joachim florskiy's mysticism, who for the first 
time assumed existences of three eras, but newest discoveries of 
unconscious, conducted by the same Young, they prove, that the model 
Of krouli, where at first nevertheless the discussion deals with the 
domination of maternal principle, more corresponds to reality.  
   <p>This finds confirmation in studies of Young's followers. 
For example, Eugene Monica, the psychoanalyst, who integrates 
some aspects of Young study, it projects the same invisible structure 
at the stage of the development of the personality: Old 
consciousness is represented by the state of the matriarchal oriented 
consciousness, and on it is observed the domination of mother and the 
tyranny of instinct. At the following level ego enters into the 
stage of urgent consciousness, which is defined as patriarchy. 
Accordingly Monica, of it is characteristic the contrast to 
bessoznatel'nogo=zhenstvennosti - soznaniyu=maskulinnosti; 
khtonicheskiy (i.e., solid) phallus is contradicted to phallus 
solar, to Logos, and other side of spirit is tyranny superego. 
Only in the total stage, defined Monikom as UNUS NUNDUSE, 
becomes possible realized individuatsiya, the realized loss of 
innocence occurs, psychological androgyneity is reached, and the godly
marriage of oppositions consists.    
   <p>Let us note that the Monicas it rests on Young's concept 
about three stages, but intuitively it cannot be held in order not to 
correct its small error in accordance with the real state of affairs.
   <p>The same we find in another student of Young - ester Of 
kharding. Deriving three stages of human development, to the 
first it separates Autos, i.e., the authority of instinct, the second 
- Ego, authority of consciousness, and by the third - Samost', i.e., 
reaching integrity. In the works of Eric noyman we find 
practically identical picture, only instead of autosa, it as the 
symbol of matriarchal supremacy proposes uroboros. 
   <p>It is interesting that the primary promise of Young 
(father, son, spirit) or (To yakhve, Christ, mercury) is unanimously 
corrected by his students. Must be, the interpretation of 
formula IAO, data Of krouli, it occurs nearer to the truth. 
   <p>Let us note that Krouli it correlates formula IAO s it 
tifaret, i.e., its passage from the point of view of the way of 
magician it corresponds, to interview with the holy angel by keeper. 
As is known, precisely, the fifth lasso of containers is 
connected with SAKH, and ordinal number five, so it becomes 
intelligible and natural. Between the establishment of axis 
Ego-Samost' and the interview with the holy Angel- keeper there is an 
obvious parallel, not note which it can only blind. 
   <p>At the quite lower level this formula is manifested 
practically in any contemporary work of mass culture. Hero 
begins from the ideal state, which as a result of the intrusion of 
external and force of aggression, is destroyed, after which, after 
passing long journey, hero preodolevayet something in himself and in 
the world, destroys evil, and original accordion is restored. 
   <p>It is significant, what in this final struggle according 
to the laws of genre hero must almost perish, and only at the last 
moment - find in himself forces, rise again for inflicting of a final 
impact. The archetype of death and revival, placed into this 
formula, at its level is twisted in each second film, shown TV. 
   <p>The intuitive understanding of formula IAO appears grow 
prettier by the litmus paper, which makes it possible to determine, 
how actually are adequate esoteric and psychological schools, with 
which we come into contact. Of course to po.chle of reaching 
interview formula IAO ceases to be urgent, but at that level, at which
we act, she is the basis of spiritual way. 
   <p>The majorities of contemporary esoteric schools, on the 
contrary - go not from Isidy to Apopu, but from Apopa to Osirisu, 
i.e., exactly vice versa. It suffices to listen to those dies, 
which are used by a majority of similar "teachers" in order of this to
be convinced: the "return to the childhood", the "destruction 
ego", the "destruction of control", the "lost paradise", "space 
parents". It is worthwhile to listen to, in what moved, 
idealistichnym voice they this say in order to draw an obvious 
conclusion - way which they propose inverted, and directed either 
toward the forced retention of stage (I), or toward the return to it, 
and flight from the burdens of the knowledge of oppositions (A-stage).
It is characteristic that the motion against the natural laws 
does not remain unpunished, and Apop, is manifested in the wild and 
unrealistic shady projections on the representatives of any other 
schools. Projection of shadow and unconsciousness are natural 
for those, who use the inverted formula. Briefly stated, 
wherever you not heard about the "backward movement", run from there 
away. 
   <p>There is a directly opposite error, which is encountered 
in satanistov, atheists and other black (but not dark, since the way 
of dark, it relates to much the higher sacraments) magicians. 
This those, for whom it succeeded, by the price of the wild 
effort to be detached away from the authority of matriarchal 
unconscious, and now they by any price try to be held in the state 
reached, erecting bastion, in the complexity not being inferior to the
Tower of Babel. It is characteristic that the stage Of apopa in 
the yungianskoy tradition already corresponds to stage Ego, and the 
fact that satanisty they constantly emphasize, celebration ego above 
all, confirms this hypothesis. 4 he would say that satanistami 
become those, who feel the greatest threat their ego from the side of 
matriarchal unconscious, and therefore they require to oppose against 
this offensive although something. 
   <p>The position of the second, deserves larger respect than 
the position of the first, since they was succeeded in move further on
the evolutionary ladder; however, those and others equally distort 
formula, and therefore, in the final analysis, I risk to lose 
consciousness. Where will carry out after wreck the bastion of 
satanistov back - in I or forward - in o, this cannot predict anyone. 
   <p>In the conclusion I want to say that the understanding of 
magic formula far from so simply as it may seem on the reading of the 
explaining materials, like this. To me there remains only to 
wish successes any to that embarked on the path of spiritual increase.
And I will emphasize that at present there is only one 
organization, whose members have gnosis of this formula, and others - 
and much higher formulas, and this organization - O.T.O.
