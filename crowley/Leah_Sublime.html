<br>
Leah Sublime,<br>
Goddess above me!<br>
Snake of the slime<br>
Alostrael, love me!<br>
Our master, the devil<br>
Prospers the revel.<br>

Tread with your foot<br>
My heart til it hurt!<br>
Tread on it, put<br>
The smear of your dirt<br>
On my love, on my shame<br>
Scribble your name!<br>
Straddle your Beast<br>
My Masterful Bitch<br>
With the thighs of you greased<br>

With the Sweat of your Itch!<br>
Spit on me, scarlet<br>
Mouth of my harlot!<br>
Now from your wide<br>
Raw cunt, the abyss,<br>
Spend spouting the tide<br>
Of your sizzling piss<br>
In my mouth; oh my Whore<br>
Let it pour, let it pour!<br>

You stale like a mare<br>
And fart as you stale;<br>
Through straggled wet hair<br>
You spout like a whale.<br>
Splash the manure<br>
And piss from the sewer.<br>
Down to me quick<br>
With your tooth on my lip<br>
And your hand on my prick<br>

With feverish grip<br>
My life as it drinks&#151;<br>
How your breath stinks!<br>
Your hand, oh unclean<br>
Your hand that has wasted<br>
Your love, in obscene<br>
Black masses, that tasted<br>
Your soul, it&#146;s your hand!<br>

Feel my prick stand!<br>
Your life times from lewd<br>
Little girl, to mature<br>
Worn whore that has chewed<br>
Your own pile of manure.<br>
Your hand was the key to&#151;<br>
And now your frig me, too!<br>
Rub all the much<br>
Of your cunt on me, Leah<br>

Cunt, let me suck<br>
All your glued gonorrhea!<br>
Cunt without end!<br>
Amen! til you spend!<br>
Cunt! you have harboured<br>
All dirt and disease<br>
In your slimy unbarbered<br>
Loose hole, with its cheese<br>
And its monthlies, and pox<br>

You chewer of cocks!<br>
Cunt, you have sucked<br>
Up pricks, you squirted<br>
Out foetuses, fucked<br>
Til bastards you blurted<br>
Out into space&#151;<br>
Spend on my face!<br>
Rub all your gleet away!<br>
Envenom the arrow.<br>

May your pox eat away<br>
Me to the marrow.<br>
Cunt you have got me;<br>
I love you to rot me!<br>
Spend again, lash me!<br>
Leah, one spasm<br>
Scream to splash me.<br>
Slime of the chasm<br>
Choke me with spilth<br>

Of your sow-belly&#146;s filth.<br>
Stab your demonical<br>
Smile to my brain!<br>
Soak me in cognac<br>
Cunt and cocaine;<br>
Sprawl on me! Sit<br>
On my mouth, Leah, shit!<br>
Shit on me, slut!<br>

Creamy the curds<br>
That drip from your gut!<br>
Greasy the turds!<br>
Dribble your dung<br>
On the tip of my tongue!<br>
Churn on me, Leah!<br>
Twist on your thighs!<br>
Smear diarrhoea<br>
Into my eyes!<br>

Splutter out shit<br>
From the bottemless pit.<br>
Turn to me, chew it<br>
With me, Leah, whore!<br>
Vomit it, spew it<br>
And lick it once more.<br>
We can make lust<br>
Drunk on disgust.<br>
Splay out your gut,<br>

Your ass hole, my lover!<br>
You buggering slut,<br>
I know where to shove her!<br>
There she goes, plumb<br>
Up the foul Bitch&#146;s bum!<br>
Sackful of skin<br>
And bone, as I speak<br>
I&#146;ll bugger your grin<br>

Into a shriek.<br>
Bugger you, slut<br>
Bugger your gut!<br>
Wriggle, you hog!<br>
Wrench at the pin!<br>
Wrench at it, drag<br>
It half out, suck it in!<br>
Scream, you hog dirt, you!<br>
I want it to hurt you!<br>

Beast-Lioness, squirt<br>
From your Cocksucker&#146;s hole!<br>
Belch out the dirt<br>
From your Syphillis soul.<br>
Splutter foul words<br>
Through your supper of turds!<br>
May the Devil our lord, your<br>
Soul scribble over<br>

With sayings of ordure!<br>
Call me your lover!<br>
Slave of the gut<br>
Of the arse of a slut!<br>
Call me your sewer<br>
Of spilth and snot<br>
Your fart-sniffer, chewer<br>
Of the shit in your slot.<br>
Call me that as you rave<br>

In the rape of your slave.<br>
Fuck! Shit! Let me come<br>
Alostrael&#151;Fuck!<br>
I&#146;ve spent in your bum.<br>
Shit! Give me the muck<br>
From my whore&#146;s arse, slick<br>
Dirt of my prick!<br>

Eat it, you sow!<br>
I&#146;m your dog, fuck, shit!<br>
Swallow it now!<br>
Rest for a bit!<br>
Satan, you gave<br>
A crown to a slave.<br>
I am your fate, on<br>
Your belly, above you.<br>

I swear it by Satan<br>
Leah, I love you.<br>
I&#146;m going insane<br>
Do it again!</p>
