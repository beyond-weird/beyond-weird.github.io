        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With these striking words the official Report of Douglas' chief
        commissioner began. It would be tedious to quote the 488 folio pages in
        full. Douglas himself did not read it; the transcript made by Vesquit of
        Abdul Bey's &quot;inspiration,&quot; with a few [235] practical
        questions to the latter, told him all that he needed.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Audience over, he dismissed Arthwait and his companion with
        orders to hold themselves in readiness for a renewal of the campaign.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas had many a moment of bitter contemplation; his hatred of
        Cyril Grey fed upon repulse; and it was evident that his assistants had
        met more than their match. He would have to act personally -- yet he
        feared to expose himself in open battle. His plan hitherto had been to
        bribe or dupe some of the jackal journalists of London to attack him;
        but Grey had not so much as troubled to bring libel actions.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But he would not give in. He studied Vesquit's transcripts
        attentively, and with indecision. He did not know how far to trust the
        oracle, and he did not understand how Vesquit had come to die, since on
        that point even Arthwait had been silent. The demons whom he consulted
        were emphatic in favour of the document, but failed to explain how the
        fortress was to be reduced from the inside.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He was clear in his mind as to the nature of Grey's operation; he
        saw perfectly that Lisa herself was the weak point in it; but he did not
        see how to get at her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He continued in his bitter mood until the early hours, and he was
        interrupted by the return of his wife from her miserable night's
        trudging. She put two francs on the table without a single word as soon
        as she entered.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Is that all?&quot; snarled Douglas. &quot;You ought to be
        getting fives again now spring's coming. Though you're not as pretty as
        you were.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He garnished this greeting with garlic of low abuse. Rarely to
        any other person did he use even mild oaths; he affected the grand
        manner; but he [236] knew that foulness of speech emphasized his wife's
        degradation. He had no need of the vile money that she earned; he had a
        thousand better means of buying whisky; but he drove her to the streets
        as no professional <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">souteneur</i> would have dared do. By extreme refinement of cruelty he
        never struck or kicked her, lest she should think he loved her. To him,
        she was a toy; a means of exercising his passion for torture;
        to her, he was the man she loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Pitifully she pleaded that the cold rain of the night -- she was
        wet through -- had driven all Paris from the boulevard to the cafe; and
        she added an excuse for her unattractiveness which should have sent her
        husband to his pistol for very shame had a spark of manhood, or a memory
        of his mother, been alive within him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Instead, he promised to change all that the next time Dr. Balloch
        came to Paris.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He had systematically degraded and humiliated her, corrupted her,
        branded her with infamy, for many a year; yet there was still in her a
        motion of revolt against the crime. But even as she made her gesture of
        repulsion, Douglas leapt to his feet, with the light of hell burning in
        his eyes. &quot;I have it!&quot; he shouted, &quot;get to your straw,
        you stinking slut. And you may thank your stars that as you can't be
        ornamental, you're going to be useful.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was dawn before Douglas turned into bed, for his great idea
        brought with it a flood of imagination, and a million problems of
        detail. The servant girl was already half dressed for the day's work;
        and he made her fetch him a final whisky before he slept.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Late in the following afternoon he woke, and sent Cremers, whom
        he had turned into a drudge, to telegraph to Balloch to come over, and
        to bring her friend Butcher to see him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas had previously refused to see this man, [237] who was a
        Chicago semi-tough. He ran a fake Rosicrucian society in America, and
        thought that Douglas could give him power over the elusive dollar. But
        Douglas had found no use for him; he rather insisted on respectability
        in his neophytes; it was only in the higher
        grades that one found the disreputable. It was an obvious point of
        policy. But Douglas had now remembered one little fact about this
        person; he fitted the Great Idea so nicely that his presence in Paris
        seemed as apt as an answer to prayer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was a rare, if doubtful, privilege to visit Douglas in his
        home. He never allowed the visit of any but those high in his
        confidence; the locality was hardly inspiring to an inquiring duchess.
        He had two other places in Paris, which he used for two types of
        interviewer; for although he discouraged knowledge of his authority in
        the Black Lodge, he did a good deal of the fishing himself, especially
        with rich or highly-placed people. For his subordinates had sticky
        fingers.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        One of these places was a discreet apartment in the very best
        quarter of Paris. Here he was the Scottish Nobleman of the Old School.
        The decorations were rich but not gaudy; even the ancestors were not
        overdone. The place of honour was occupied by Rob Roy's claymore,
        alleged. One of his claims was that the Highland Cateran was his
        ancestor, owing to a liason with a fairy. Another claim was that he
        himself was James IV of Scotland,
        that he had survived the Battle of Flodden Field, become an adept, and
        immortal. Despite what to a profane mind might seem the incompatibility
        of these two legends -- to say nothing of the improbability of either --
        they were greedily swallowed by the Theosophist section of his
        following.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In this apartment he received the credulous type of person who is
        impressed by rank; and no man [238] could play the part of stateliness
        better than this old reprobate.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His other place was of the hermit's cell model, a tiny cottage
        with its well-kept garden; such abound all over Paris in the most
        unexpected spots.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He actually imposed upon the old lady who kept this house for
        him. Here he was the simple old man of utter holiness, the lonely
        recluse, the saintly anchorite, his only food bruised herbs or pulse,
        his only drink the same as quenched the thirst of Father Adam. His long
        absences from this sacrosanct abode were explained by the fact of his
        absorption in trance, in which he was supposed to indulge underground.
        Of course he only visited the place when he had to receive a certain
        type of&nbsp; visitor, that
        loftier type which has enough rank and wealth to know that they are not
        necessary to a search after Truth, and is impressed by simplicity and
        saintliness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was at the former address that the Count received Mr. Butcher.
        He was dressed in severe and refined broadcloth, with the rosette of the
        Legion of Honour -- to which he was well entitled -- in his buttonhole.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In presence of this splendour the American was ill at ease; but
        Douglas knew how to make a man his own by giving him a good conceit of
        himself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am proud to meet you, Mr. Butcher,&quot; he began,
        affably. &quot;May I beg of you to take the trouble to be seated! The
        chair is worthy of you,&quot; he added, with a smile; &quot;it was at
        one time the property of Frederick the Great.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The servant, who was dressed as a Highland Gillie in gala
        costume, offered cigars and whisky.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Say, this is sure some whisky, Count! This is where I fall
        off the wagon, one time, John. You watch my batting average!&quot;
        observed Mr. Butcher, settling himself by placing his legs upon the
        table. [239]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is from the private stock of the Duke of Argyll,&quot;
        returned Douglas. &quot;And you, Mr. Butcher? I knew a Count Butcher
        many years ago. You are a relation?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Mr. Butcher had only the vaguest notion as to his ancestry. His
        mother had broken down under cross-examination.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Search me!&quot; he replied, biting the end off his cigar,
        and&nbsp; spitting it out.
        &quot;We Rosicrucians are out for the Hundred Years Club Dope, and the
        Long Green Stone; we should worry. We're short on ancestors in
        Illinois.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But these matters are important in magic,&quot; urged
        Douglas. &quot;Heredity goes for much. I should be glad indeed to hear
        that you were one of the Dorsetshire Butchers, for example, or even the
        Shropshire branch. In both families second sight is an appanage.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Here the conversation was interrupted by the gillie. &quot;I
        crave your pardon, my lord,&quot; he said, bowing; &quot;but his Grace
        the Duke of Hants is at the door to beg your aid in a most urgent matter
        which concerns his family honour.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am engaged,&quot; said Douglas. &quot; He may
        write.&quot; The man withdrew with a solemn bow.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I must apologize for this disturbance,&quot; continued
        Douglas. &quot;The importunity of one's clients is exceedingly
        distressing. It is one of our penalties. I venture to suppose that you
        are yourself much annoyed in similar ways.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Butcher would have liked to boast that J. P. Morgan was always
        trying to borrow money from him, but he dared not attempt to bluff his
        host. Nor did he suspect that Douglas was himself engaged in that
        diverting and profitable pastime.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;To come to business,&quot; went on Douglas, eyeing his
        guest narrowly, and assuring himself that his [240] scheme had borne
        fruit in due season, &quot;What is it that you require of me? Frankly, I
        like you; and I have long admired your noble career. All that I can do
        for you -- in -- honour -- pray count it done!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Why, Count,&quot; said Mr. Butcher, spitting on the floor;
        &quot;Buttinsky's in Kalamazoo. But to come down to brass tacks, I guess
        I'd like to sit into the game.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I pray you to excuse me,&quot; replied Douglas, &quot;but
        my long residence in Paris has almost deprived me of the comprehension
        of my mother tongue. Could you explain yourself further?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Why, this Black Lodge stunt, Count. It's a humdinger. I
        guess it's a hell of a favour, but I see a dollar at the end of it, and
        old Doc. Butcher buys a one-way ticket.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas grew portentous. &quot;Are you aware of what you
        ask?&quot; he thundered. &quot;Do you understand that the ineffable and
        Sacrosanct Arcanum is not to be touched by profane hands? Must I inform
        you that Those who may not be named are even now at the Gate of the
        Abyss, whetting their fangs upon the Cubical Stone of the Unutterable?
        Oh ye magistral ministrants of the Shrine of the Unspeakable
        Abomination! Hear ye the Word of Blasphemy!&quot; He spoke rapidly and
        thickly in a tongue unknown to Butcher, who became alarmed, and even
        took his legs off the table.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Say!&quot; he cried. &quot;Have a heart! Can the rough
        dope, Count! This is a straight proposition, honest to God!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am already aware of your sincerity,&quot; answered the
        other. &quot;But infinite courage is required to confront those
        formidable Entities that lie in wait for the seeker even at the first
        Portal of the Descending Staircase!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, I'm wise to Old Dog Cerberus. Ish [241] Kabibble. Gimme
        an upper berth in the Chicawgo, Saint Lewis, and Hell Limited, if it
        busts the roll. Do you get me, Steve?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I understand you to say that you persist in your
        application.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Sure. Andrew P. Satan for mine.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I shall be pleased to place your name before the Watchers
        of the Gate.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How deep do I have to dig?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Dig? I did not quite catch your remark.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;In the wad. Weigh the dough! What does it set me back? Me
        for the bread-line?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The initiation fee is one thousand francs.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I guess I can skin that off without having to eat at
        Childs.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You will remit the amount to the Comptroller of my Privy
        Purse. Here is the address. Now be so good as to sign the preliminary
        application-form.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They went over to the bureau (Douglas was prepared to derive it
        from the library of Louis XIV), on which lay a private letter from the
        Kaiser, if one might believe the embossed arms and address, and a note
        asking President Poincare to dinner, &quot;quite informally, my dear
        friend,&quot; which Butcher could not fail to see. The preliminary
        application form was a document which might have served for an
        exceptionally solemn treaty. But Douglas was above the charlatanism of
        requiring a signature in blood: Butcher signed it with an ordinary
        fountain pen.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And now, Mr. Butcher,&quot; said Douglas, &quot;I will ask
        you in your turn to render me a small service.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Bat it up!&quot; said Mr. Butcher. &quot;I would buy an
        Illustrated Edition of O. Henry in nineteen parts.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas did not know that Americans dread book agents more than
        rattlesnakes; but he gathered [242] that his guest would acquiesce in
        any reasonable suggestion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am informed that you are -- or were -- a Priest of the
        Roman Church.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Peter is my middle name,&quot; admitted the 'Rosicrucian,'
        &quot;and that's no jolly.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But -- apart from questions of nomenclature for the moment,
        if you will pardon me -- you are a priest of the Roman Church?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yep: I took a chance on Pop Dago Benedict. But it's a con
        game; I'm from Missouri. Four-flushing gold brick merchants! Believe me,
        some bull! I took it like playing three days in Bumville. Them boobs got
        my goat for fair, babe. No pipe!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You were interdicted in consequence of some scandal?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I ran a sporting house on the side, and I guess they
        endorsed my license for speeding.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Your Bishop took umbrage at some business activity which he
        judged incompatible with your vows?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Like Kelly did.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, Bishop Kelly. Far too severe a disciplinarian, in my
        judgment. But you are still a priest? Your orders are still valid? A
        baptism or a marriage performed by you would hold good?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's a cinch. The Hallelujah Guarantee and Trust Company,
        St. Paul. Offices in the James D. Athanasius Building.&quot; 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then, sir, I shall ask of you the favour to hold yourself
        in readiness to baptize two persons at nine of the evening precisely,
        the day after to-morrow. That ceremony will be followed by another, in
        which you will marry them.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I swan.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I may rely on your good offices?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'll come in a wheelbarrow.&quot; [243]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Suit yourself, Mr. Butcher, as to the mode of transit; but
        pray be careful to attend punctually, and in canonical costume.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'll dig the biretta out of the ice-box.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After a further exchange of courtesies the new disciple took his
        leave.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The same evening witnessed a very different interview.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Antony Bowling was being eentertained at dinner by Simon Iff, and their conversation turned upon the favourite subject of the old
        mystic -- the Way of the Tao.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;In view of what you have been saying about the necessity of
        dealing with mediums on their own ground,&quot; remarked the host,
        &quot;let me tell you of a paradox in magick. Do you remember a certain
        chapter in the Bible which tells one, almost in consecutive verses,
        firstly to answer a fool according to his folly, and secondly, not so to
        answer him? This is the Scriptural version of a truth which we phrase
        otherwise. There are two ways of dealing with an opponent; one by
        beating him on his own ground, the other by withdrawing to a higher
        plane. You can fight fire with fire, or you can fight fire with water.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is, roughly speaking, legitimate magick to resolve a
        difficult situation in either of these two ways. Alter it, or withdraw
        to higher ground. The black magician, or as I prefer to call him,
        sorcerer, for the word magick should not be profaned, invariably
        withdraws to lower planes. Let us seek an analogy in the perfectly
        concrete case of the bank cashier.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This gentleman, we will assume, finds his salary inadequate
        to his outgoings. Now he may economize, that is, withdraw himself to a
        kind of life where money is no longer needed in such quantity, or he
        [244] may devote himself day and night to his business, and so increase
        his salary. But there is no third course open to a man of self-respect.
        The sorcerer type of man appeals to lower planes of money-making. He
        begins by gambling; beaten there, he resorts to the still viler means of
        embezzlement; perhaps, finally, he attempts to cover his thefts by
        murdering his mother for the insurance money.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Notice how, as his plane becomes debased, his fears grow
        greater. At first, he is merely annoyed about his creditors; in the next
        stage, he fears being sharped by his fellow-gamblers; then, it is the
        police who loom terrible in his mind; and lastly the grim form of the
        executioner threatens him.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Very nicely Hogarthed,&quot; said Lord Antony.
        &quot;Reminds me of how the habit of lying degenerates into
        unintelligible stupidity. We had a case in the War Office last month, a
        matter of supplying certain furs. As you know, the seal furnishes a
        valuable fur. Less valuable, though superficially similar, is that of
        the rabbit. Now in trade, so it appears, it is impolitic to say rabbit,
        which sounds cheap and nasty, so the Scriptural equivalent, coney, is
        employed, thus combining Piety with Profit. Having caught your coney,
        you proceed to cook him, until he
        resembles seal. So you have a dyed rabbit-skin, and you call it seal
        coney. But there are by-ways that stray further yet from the narrow lane
        of truth. The increasing demand for rabbits has reduced the profit on
        seal coney, and it becomes desirable to find a cheaper substitute.
        Reckless of the susceptibilities of the ancient Egyptians, this is found
        in that domesticated representative of the lion family which consoles
        our spinsters. Having disguised the skin as far as may be, they next
        disguise the name; some buyer must be made to pay the price of seal
        coney, and think that he is getting it; so 'cat' becomes `trade seal
        coney' [245] -- and unless one has the whole story there is no
        possibility of derivation. The lie has become mere misnomer.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is the general case of Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy,&quot;
        returned Simon Iff. &quot;I had an amusing example the other day in an
        article that I wrote for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Review</i>
        -- rather prudish people. My little essay ended: `So Science offers her
        virgin head to the caress of Magick.' The editor thought `virgin' rather
        a `suggestive' word, and replaced it by 'maiden'.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You remind me of a curate we had over at Grimthorpe
        Ambrose. 'Leg' has for many years been a not quite proper word; when the
        terrible necessity of referring to it arose, the polite ass replaced it
        by 'limb.'
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The refined sensibility of our curate perceived the
        indelicacy of saying 'limb,' since every one knew that it meant 'leg';
        so he wrapped it up in the decent obscurity of the Latin language, and
        declined to play croquet one afternoon on the ground that, the day
        before, in visiting old Mrs. Postlethwaite, he had severely strained his
        member.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The wicked fall into the pit that they
        have digged,&quot; said Iff. &quot;All this applies to the question of
        magick. It is a question
        of debasing coinage. I have great sympathy with the ascetics of India
        and their monkish imitators in Europe. They held spiritual gifts to be
        of supreme value, and devoted their lower powers to the development of
        the higher. Of course mistakes were made; the principle was carried too
        far; they were silly enough to injure their lower powers by undue
        fasting, flagellation, and even mutilation. They got the false idea that
        the body was an enemy, whereas it is a servant -- the only servant
        available. But the idea was right; they wanted to exchange dross for
        gold. Now the sorcerer [246] offers his gold for dross, tries to
        exchange his highest powers for money or the gratification of envy or
        revenge. The Christian Scientist, absurdly so-called, is a sorcerer of
        the basest type, for he devotes the whole wealth of religion to the
        securing of his bodily health. It is somewhat stupid, too, as his main
        claim is that the body is only an illusion!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Am I right in suggesting that ordinary life is a mean
        between these extremes, that the noble man devotes his material wealth
        to lofty ends, the advancement of science, or art, or some such true
        ideal; and that the base man does the opposite by concentrating all his
        abilities on the amassing of wealth?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Exactly; that is the real distinction between the artist
        and the bourgeois, or, if you prefer it, between the gentleman and the
        cad. Money, and the things money can buy, have no value, for there is no
        question of creation, but only of exchange. Houses, lands, gold, jewels,
        even existing works of art, may be tossed about from one hand to
        another; they are so, constantly. But neither you nor I can write a
        sonnet; and what we have, our appreciation of art, we did not buy. We
        inherited the germ of it, and we developed it by the sweat of our brows.
        The possession of money helped us, but only by giving us time and
        opportunity and the means of travel. Anyhow, the principle is clear; one
        must sacrifice the lower to the higher, and, as the Greeks did with
        their oxen, one must fatten and bedeck the lower, so that it may be the
        worthier offering.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And what happens when you go on the other tack?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;When you trade your gold for pewter you impoverish
        yourself. The sorcerer sells his soul for money; spends the money, and
        finds he has nothing else to sell. Have you noticed that Christian
        Scientists [247] are hardly ever in robust health? They have given up
        their spiritual forces for a quite imaginary standard of well-being; and
        those forces, which were supporting the body quite well enough without
        their stupid interference, are debilitated and frittered away. I pray
        daily for a great war, that may root out the coward fear of death and
        poverty in the minds of these degenerate wretches. Death should be, as
        it used to be in the middle ages, even, and yet more in pagan times, the
        fit reward and climax of a life well spent in risking it for noble
        causes; and poverty should be a holy and blessed state, worthy of the
        highest minds and the happiest, and of them alone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;To return to our sheep -- I mean our sorcerer. He has not
        much against him to begin with, but he chooses to trade his sword for
        gold. The barbarian, having the sword, naturally uses it to recover the
        gold. In other words, the devil, having bought the soul, regains the
        price, for the sorcerer spends it in the devil's service. The next stage
        is that the sorcerer resorts to crime, declares war on all humanity. He
        uses vulgar means to attain his ends, and the price may be his liberty.
        Ultimately, he may lose life itself in some last desperate effort to&nbsp;
        retrieve all at a blow. When I was young and had less experience,
        I had many a fight with sorcerers; and it was always the end of the
        fight when Mr. Sorcerer broke the law. He was no longer fighting me, but
        the consolidated will of humanity; and he had no time to attack me when
        he was busy building breakwaters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And that reminds me. We have a young friend at bay -- with
        the worst pack of devils in the world at him. I wonder if I have done
        wrong to leave him so much to himself. But I wanted the boy to gain all
        the laurels; he's young enough to like them.&quot;
        
        </p>

        &quot;I think I know who you mean,&quot; said Lord Antony,
        smiling; &quot;and I don't think you need be [248] very much afraid. I

        the original hatred; and, unfortunately, the boy made some fundamental

        pet pugilist used to say. And now I must run away; there is a seance

        name among the martyrs!&quot;
