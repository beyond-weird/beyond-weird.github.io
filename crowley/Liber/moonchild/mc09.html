        THEY BROUGHT THE BAD NEWS FROM ARAGO TO &nbsp;QUINCAMPOIX: AND WHAT ACTION WAS TAKEN THEREUPON</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        JUST as Lord Antony Bowling turned into the Grands Boulevards
        from the Faubourg Montmartre, Akbar Pasha was leaving them. The Turk did
        not see the genially flourished cane; he was preoccupied -- and perhaps
        he did not wish to be recognized. For he dodged among the obscure and
        dangerous streets of &quot;The Belly of Paris&quot; with many a look
        behind him. To be sure, this is but a reasonable precaution in a
        district so favourable to Apache activities.
        At last he came out into the great open square of the markets; and,
        crossing obliquely, came to a drinking den of the type which seeks to
        attract foreigners, preferably Americans. It bore the quite incongruous
        name &quot;Au Pere Tranquille.&quot; Akbar mounted the stairs. It was
        too early for revellers; even the musicians had not arrived; but an old
        man sat in one corner of the room, sipping a concoction of gin, whisky
        and rum which goes in certain circles by the name of a Nantucket
        Cocktail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This individual was of some sixty years of age; his hair and
        beard were white; his dress was that of a professional man, and he
        endeavoured to give dignity to his appearance by the assumption of a
        certain paternal or even patriarchal manner. But his eye was pale and
        cold as a murderer's, shifty and furtive as a thief's. His hands
        trembled continually [117] with a kind of palsy; and the white knuckles
        told a tale of gout. Self-indulgence had bloated his body; unhealthy fat
        was everywhere upon him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The trembling of his hands seemed in sympathy with that of his
        mind; one would have said that he was in deadly fear, or the prey to a
        consuming anxiety.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the Turk's entrance he rose clumsily, then fell back into his
        chair. He was more than half intoxicated.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Akbar took the chair opposite to him. &quot;We couldn't get
        it,&quot; he said; in a whisper, though there was nobody within earshot.
        &quot;Oh, Dr. Balloch, Dr. Balloch! do try to understand! It was
        impossible. We tried all sorts of ways.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The doctor's voice had a soft suavity. Though a licensed
        physician, he had long since abandoned legitimate practice, and under
        the guise of homeopathy pursued various courses which would have been
        but ill regarded by more regular practitioners.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His reply was horrible, uttered as it was in feline falseness,
        like a caress. &quot;You foul ass!&quot; he said. &quot;I have to
        take
        this up with S.R.M.D., you know! What will he say and do?&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I tell you I couldn't. There was an old man there who
        spoilt everything, in my idea.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;An old man?&quot; Dr. Balloch almost dropped his
        hypocritical bedside voice in his rage. &quot;Oh curse, oh curse it
        all!&quot; He leant over to the Turk, caught his beard, and deliberately
        pulled it. There is no grosser insult that you can offer to a Mussulman,
        but Akbar accepted it without resentment. Yet so savage was the assault
        that a sharp cry of pain escaped him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        You dog! you Turkish swine!&quot; hissed Balloch. &quot;Do you
        know what has happened? S.R.M.D. sent a Watcher -- a bit of himself, do
        you understand what that means, you piece of dirt? -- and it hasn't
        returned. It must have been killed, but we can't find out how, [118] and
        S.R.M.D. is lying half dead in his house. You pig! Why didn't you come
        with your storry at once? I know now what is wrong.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You know I don't know your address,&quot; said the Turk
        humbly. &quot;Please, oh please, leave go of my beard!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch contemptuously released his victim -- who was a brave
        enough man in an ordinary way, and would have had the blood of his own
        Sultan, though he knew that the guards would cut him to pieces within
        the next ten seconds, for the least of such words as had been addressed
        to him. But Balloch was his Superior in the Black Lodge, which rules by
        terror and by torture; its first principle was to enslave its members.
        The bully Balloch became
        a whimpering cur at the slightest glance of the dreaded S.R.M.D.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Tell me what the old man was like,&quot; he said. &quot;Did
        you get his name?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; said Akbar, &quot;I got that. It was Simon
        Iff.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch dashed his glass upon the ground. &quot;Oh hell! Oh hell!
        Oh hell!&quot; he said, not so much as a curse but as an invocation.
        &quot;Hear, oh hear this creature! The ignorant, blind swine! You had
        him -- Him! -- under your hand; oh hell, you fool, you fool!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        I felt sure he was somebody,&quot; said Akbar, &quot;but I had no
        orders.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And no brains, no brains,&quot; snarled the other.
        &quot;Look here; I'll tell you how to get your step in the Lodge if
        you'll give me a hundred pounds.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do you mean it?&quot; cried Akbar, entirely his own man in
        a moment, for abject fear and obsessing ambition combined to make his
        advancement the tyrant of his whole tormented mind. &quot;Will you swear
        it?&quot; [119]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch made an ugly face. &quot;By the black sow's udder, I
        will.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His whole frame trembling with excitement, Akbar Pasha drew a
        cheque-book from his pocket, and filled in a blank for the required sum.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch snatched it greedily. &quot;This is worth your
        money,&quot; he said. &quot;That man Iff is in the second grade, perhaps
        even the first, of their dirty Order; and we sometimes think he's the
        most powerful of the whole damned crew. That fool Grey's a child to him.
        I know now how the Watcher was destroyed. Oh! S.R.M.D. will pay somebody
        for this! But listen, man -- you bring that old beast's head on a
        charger -- or Grey's, either! -- and you can have any grade you dare ask
        for! And that's no lie, curse it! Why,&quot; he went on with increasing
        vehemence, &quot;the whole thing's a plant of ours. Monet-Knott's one of
        us; we use him to blackmail Lavinia King -- about all he's fit for, the
        prig! And we got him to drag that dago woman in front of Master Grey's
        dog nose! And&nbsp; now they
        bring in Simon Iff. Oh, it s too much! We've even lost their trail. Ten
        to one they're safe in their Abbey to-night. Be off! No, wait for me
        here; I'll bring back orders. And while I'm gone, get that son of yours
        here -- he's got more sense than you. We'll have to trace Grey somehow
        -- and astral watchers won't do the trick when Simon Iff's about.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch rose to his feet, buttoned his coat around him, put on a
        tall silk hat, and was gone without wasting another word upon his
        subordinate.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Turk would have given his ears to have dared to follow him.
        The mystery of S.R.M.D.'s personality and abode were shrouded in the
        blackest secrecy. Akbar had but the vaguest ideas of the man; he was a
        formless ideal of terrific power and knowledge, a sort of incarnated
        Satan, the epitome of successful [120] iniquity. The episode of the
        &quot;Watcher&quot; had not diminished the chief's prestige in his eyes;
        it was evidently an &quot;accident&quot;; S.R.M.D.
        had sent out a patrol and it had been ambushed by a whole division, as
        it were. So trivial a &quot;regrettable incident&quot; was negligibly
        normal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Akbar had no thought but of S.R.M.D. as a Being infinitely great
        in himself; he had no conception of the price paid by the members of the
        Black Lodge. The truth is, that as its intimates advance, their power
        and knowledge becomes enormously greater; but such progress is not a
        mark of general growth, as it is in the case of the White Brotherhood;
        it is like a cancer, which indeed grows apace, but at the expense of the
        man on whom it feeds, and will destroy both him and itself in the long
        run. The process may be slow; it may extend over a series of
        incarnations; but it is sure enough. The analogy of the cancer is a
        close one; for the man knows his doom, suffers continual torture; but to
        this is added the horrible delusion that if only the disease can be
        induced to advance far enough, all is saved. Thus he hugs the fearful
        growth, cherishes it as his one dearest possession, stimulates it by
        every means in his power. Yet all the time he nurses in his heart an
        agonizing certainty that this is the way of death.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch knew S.R.M.D. well; had known him for years. He hoped to
        supplant him, and while he feared him with hideous and unmanly fear,
        hated him with most hellish hatred. He was under no delusion as to the
        nature of the Path of the Black Lodge. Akbar Pasha, a mere outsider,
        without a crime on his hands as yet, was a rich and honoured officer in
        the service of the Sultan; he, Balloch, was an ill-reputed doctor,
        living on the fears of old maids, on doubtful and even criminal services
        to foolish people from the supply of morphia to the suppression of [121]
        the evidence of scandal, and on the harvest of half-disguised blackmail
        that goes with such pursuits. But he was&nbsp;
        respectability itself compared to S.R.M.D.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This man, who called himself the Count Macgregor of Glenlyon, was
        in reality a Hampshire man, of lowland Scottish extraction, of the name
        of Douglas. He had been well educated, became a good scholar, and
        developed an astounding taste and capacity for magic. For some time he
        had kept straight; then he had fallen, chosen the wrong road. His powers
        had increased at a bound; but they were solely used for base ends. He
        had established the Black Lodge far more firmly than ever before,
        jockeyed his seniors out of office by superior villainy, and proceeded
        to forge the whole weapon to his own liking. He had had one terrible
        set-back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey, when only twenty years of age, a free-lance magician,
        had entered the Lodge; for it worked to attract innocent people under a
        false pretence of wisdom and of virtue. Cyril, discovering the trick,
        had not withdrawn; he had played the game of the Lodge, and made himself
        Douglas's right-hand man. This being achieved, he had suddenly put a
        match to the arsenal.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Lodge was always seething with hate; Theosophists themselves
        might have taken lessons from this exponent; and the result of Cyril's
        intervention had been to disintegrate the entire structure. Douglas
        found his prestige gone, and his income with it. Addiction to drink,
        which had accompanied his magical fall, now became an all-absorbing
        vice. He was never able to rebuild his Lodge on its former lines; but
        those who thirsted for knowledge and power and these he still possessed
        in ever increasing abundance as he himself decayed -- clung to him,
        hating and envying him, as a young ruffian of the [122] streets will
        envy the fame of some robber or murderer who happens to fill the public
        eye.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was with this clot of perverse feelings that Balloch
        approached the Rue Quincampoix, one of the lowest streets in Paris, and
        turned in at the den where Douglas lodged.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        S.R.M.D. was lying on a torn soiled sofa, his face white as
        death; a mottled and empurpled nose, still showing trace of its original
        aggressive and haughty model, alone made for colour. For his eyes were
        even paler than the doctor's. In his hand was a bottle half full of raw
        whisky, with which he was seeking to restore his vitality.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I brought you some whisky,&quot; said Balloch, who knew the
        way to favour.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Put it down, over there. You've got some money.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch did not dare to lie. S.R.M.D. had spotted the fact
        without a word.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Only a cheque. You shall have half to-morrow when I've cashed
        it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Come here at noon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Despite the obvious degradation of his whole being, S.R.M.D. was
        still somebody. He was a wreck, but he was the wreck of something
        indubitably big. He had not only the habit of command, but the tone of
        fine manners. In his palmy days he had associated with some very highly
        placed people. It was said that the Third Section of the Russian Police
        Bureau had once found a use for him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Is the Countess at home?&quot; asked Balloch, apparently in
        courtesy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;She's on the Boulevard. Where else should she be, at this
        time of night?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was the vilest thing charged against that vile parody of a
        man, his treatment of his wife, a young, beautiful, talented, and
        charming girl, the sister of [123] a famous Professor at the Sorbonne.
        He had delighted to reduce her to the bedraggled street-walker that she
        now was.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Nobody knew what Douglas did with his money. The contributions of
        his Lodge were large; blackmail and his wife's earnings aided the
        exchequer; he had probably a dozen other sources of income. Yet he never
        extricated himself from his sordidness; and he was always in need of
        money. It was no feigned need, either; for he was sometimes short of
        whisky.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The man's knowledge of the minds of others was uncanny; he read
        Balloch at a gesture.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Grey never struck the Watcher,&quot; he said; &quot;it was
        not his style; who was it?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Simon Iff.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I shall see to that.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch understood that, though S.R.M.D. feared Iff and loathed
        him, his great preoccupation was with Cyril Grey. He hated the young
        magician with a perfect hatred; he would never forget his ruin at those
        boyish hands. Also, he forgave nothing, from a kindness to an insult; he
        was malignant for the sake of malice.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They will have gone over to their house on Montmartre,&quot; continued Douglas, in a voice of absolute certitude.
        &quot;We must have the exits watched by Abdul Bey and his men. But I
        know what Grey will do as well as if he had told me; he will bolt
        somewhere warm for his damned honeymoon. You and Akbar watch the Gare de
        Lyon.
        Now, look here! with a bit of luck, we'll finish off this game; I'm
        weary of it. Mark me well!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas rose. The whisky he had drunk was impotent to affect him,
        head or legs. He went over to a small table on which were painted
        certain curious figures. He took a saucer, poured some [124] whisky into
        it, and dropped a five-franc piece into the middle. Then he began to
        make weird gestures, and to utter a long conjuration, harsh-sounding,
        and apparently in gibberish. Lastly, he set fire to the whisky in the
        saucer. When it was nearly burnt through, he blew it out. He took the
        coin, wrapped it in a piece of dark-red silk, and gave it to his pupil.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;When Grey boards a traiin,&quot; he ordered, &quot;go up to
        the engine-driver, give him this, and tell him to drive carefully. Let
        me know what the fellow looks like; get his name, if you can; say you
        want to drink his health. Then come straight here in a cab.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch nodded. The type of magic proposed was familiar enough to
        him. He took the coin and made off.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the Sign of the Tranquil Father, Akbar was awaiting him with
        his son Abdul Bey. The latter was in charge of the Turkish Secret
        Service in Paris, and he did not hesitate to use the facilities thus at
        his disposal to his own magical advancement. All his resources were
        constantly at the service of Balloch. Now that S.R.M.D. himself was
        employing him, he was beside himself with pride and pleasure.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch gave his instructions. An hour later the house where Lisa
        was even then undergoing her ordeal would be surrounded by spies;
        additional men would be placed at all the big terminals of Paris; for
        Abdul Bey meant to do the thing thoroughly. He would not take a chance;
        for all his fanatical faith in Douglas, he thought it prudent to provide
        against the possibility of an error in the chief's occult calculations.
        Also, his action would prove
        his zeal. Besides, Cyril might deliberately lay a false trail -- was
        almost sure to play some trick of the sort.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch and Akbar Pasha were stationed in a [125] restaurant
        facing the Gare de Lyon, ready to answer the telephone at any
        moment.&quot; Now,&quot; said Abdul, &quot;Have you photographs of these
        people to show my men?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch produced them.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I've seen this man Grey somewhere,&quot; remarked the young
        Turk casually. And then he gave a sudden and terrible cry. In Lisa he&nbsp;
        recognized an unknown woman whom he had admired the year before
        at a dance -- and whom he had craved ever since. &quot;Tell
        S.R.M.D.,&quot; he roared, &quot;that I'm in this thing for life or
        death; but I ask the girl for a trophy.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You'll get that, or anything else,&quot; said Balloch,
        &quot;if you can put an end to the activities of Mr. Cyril Grey.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul Bey rushed off without another word spoken; and Balloch and
        the Pasha went to the rendezvous appointed. They passed that night and
        the next day in alternate bouts of drink and sleep. About half-past
        eight on the following evening the telephone rang. Douglas had judged
        rightly; the lovers had arrived at the Gare de Lyon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Balloch and his pupil sprang to life -- fresh and vigorous at the
        prick of the summons to action.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was easy to mark the tall figure of the magician, with the
        lovely girl upon his arm; at the barrier their distinction touched the
        humanity of the collector. Tickets through to Rome -- and no luggage!
        Most evidently an elopement!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With romantic sympathy, the kind man determined to oppose the
        passage of Balloch, whom he supposed to he an angry father or an
        outraged husband. But the manner of the Englishman disarmed him;
        besides, he had a ticket to Dijon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Concealing himself as best he could, the doctor walked rapidly to
        the head of the train. There, assuming the character of a timid old man,
        he [126] implored the driver, with the gift of the bewitched
        &quot;cart-wheel,&quot; to be sure to drive carefully. He would drink
        the good fellow's health, to be sure -- what name? Oh! Marcel Dufour.
        &quot;Of the furnace -- that is appropriate!&quot; laughed the genial
        passenger, apparently reassured as to his security.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But he did not enter the train. He dashed out of the station, and
        into a motor-cab, overjoyed to return to Douglas with so clean a record
        of work accomplished.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He never gave the Turk another thought.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Akbar Pasha had had an idea. Balloch had taken a ticket for
        Dijon -- he would take one, too. And he would go -- he would retrieve
        his error of yesterday. He was not in the least afraid of that cub Grey,
        when Simon Iff was not there to back him. It would go hard, but he
        should get a drop of Lisa's blood -- if he had to bribe the wagon-lit
        man. Then -- who knows? -- there might even be a chance to kill Grey. He
        waited till the last moment before he boarded the train.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The train would stop at Moret-les-Sablons; by that time the beds
        would be made up; he would have plenty of time to act; he could go on to
        Rome if necessary.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey, away from the influence of Simon Iff, had become the
        sarcastic sphinx once more. He was wearing a travelling suit with
        knickerbockers, but he still affected the ultra-pontifical diplomatist.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The upholstery of these cars is revolting,&quot; he said to
        Lisa, with a glance of disgust. And he suddenly opened the door away
        from the platform and lifted her on to the permanent way; thence into a
        stuffy compartment in the train that was standing at the next
        &quot;Voie.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A frosty moonlight night like this,&quot; he said, pulling
        a large black pipe from his pocket and filling [127] it, &quot;indicates
        (to romantic lovers like ourselves) the propriety of a descent at Moret,
        a walk to Barbizon through the forest, a return to Moret by a similar
        route in a day or so, and the pursuance of our journey to Naples. See
        Naples and die!&quot; he added musingly, &quot;decidedly a superior
        programme.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa would have listened to a proposition to begin their travels
        by swimming the Seine, on the ground that the day after to-morrow would
        be Friday; so she raised no objection. But she could not help saying
        that they would have reached Moret more quickly by the rapide.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;My infant child!&quot; he returned; &quot; the celebrated
        Latin poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus has observed, for our edification
        and behoof, 'Festina lente.' This epigram has been translated by a
        famous Spanish author, 'manana.' Dante adds his testimony to truth in
        his grandiose outburst, 'Domani.' Also, an Arab philosopher, whom I
        personally revere, remarks, if we may trust the assertion of Sir Richard
        Francis Burton, K.C.M.G. -- and why should
        we not? -- 'Conceal thy tenets, thy treasure, and thy travelling!' This
        I do. More so,&quot; he concluded cryptically, &quot;than you
        imagine!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They were still waiting for their local funeral (which the French
        grandiloquently describe as a train) to start when Dr. Balloch returned
        radiant to the Rue Quincampoix.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas was on the alert to receive him. The news took only a
        second to communicate.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Marcel Dufour!&quot; cried S.R.M.D. &quot;We shall drink
        for him, as he may not drink on duty.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He carefully opened two bottles of whisky, mixed the stale spirit
        in the magic saucer with their contents, and bade Balloch join him at
        the table.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Your very good health, Marcel Dufour!&quot; cried Douglas.
        &quot;And mind you drive carefully!&quot; [128] Balloch and he now set
        to work steadily to drain the two bottles -- a stiff nip every minute --
        but the stuff had no effect on them. It was far otherwise with the man
        on the engine.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Almost before he had well left Paris behind him, he began to fret
        about the furnace, and told his fireman to keep up the fullest head of
        steam. At Melun the train should have slackened speed; instead, it
        increased it. The signalman at Fontainebleau was amazed to see the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">rapide</i> rush through the station, eight minutes ahead of time,
        against the signals. He saw the driver grappling with the fireman, who
        was thrown from the foot-plate a moment
        after, but escaped with a broken leg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;My mate went suddenly mad,&quot; the injured man explained
        later. &quot;He held up a five-franc piece which some old gentleman had
        given him, and&nbsp; swore that
        the devil had promised him another if he made Dijon in two hours. (And,
        as you know, it is five, what horror!).&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He grew afraid, saw the signals set at danger, and sprang to the
        lever. Then that poor crazed Dufour had thrown him off the train.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The guard was new to that section of the line, and so, no doubt,
        too timid to take the initiative; he certainly should have applied the
        brakes, even at Melun.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        An hour later Cyril Grey and Lisa and all their fellow passengers
        were turned out at Fontainebleau. There had been a terrible disaster to
        the Paris-Rome <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rapide</i> at
        Moret. The line would be blocked all night.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This contretemps,&quot; said Cyril, as if he had heard of a
        change of programme at a theatre, &quot;will add appreciably to the
        length -- and, may I add, to the romance -- of our proposed walk.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When they reached Moret more than three hours [129] later, they
        found the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rapide</i> inextricably
        tangled with a heavy freight train. It had left the line at the curve
        and crashed into the slower train. Cyril Grey had still a surprise in
        store. He produced a paper of some sort from his pocket, which the
        officer of the police cordon received in the manner of the infant Samuel
        when overwhelmed by the gift of prophecy. He made way for them with
        proud deference.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They had not to walk far before the magician found what he was
        seeking. Beneath the ruins of the rear compartment were the remains of
        the late Akbar Pasha.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I wonder how that happened,&quot; he said. &quot;However,
        here is a guess at your epitaph: 'a little learning is a dangerous
        thing.' I think, Lisa, that we should sup at the Cheval Blanc before we
        start our walk to Barbizon. It is a long way, especially at night, and
        we want to cut away to the west so as to avoid Fontainebleau, for the
        sake of the romance of the thing.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa did not mind whether she supped at the White Horse, or on
        one. She realized that she had hold of a man of strength, wisdom, and
        foresight, far more than a match for their enemies.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He stopped to speak to the officer in charge of the cordon as
        they passed him. &quot;Among the dead: Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Grey. English
        people. No flowers. Service of the minister.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The officer promised to record the lie officially. His deference
        was amazing. Lisa perceived that her lover had been at the pains to arm
        himself with more than one kind of weapon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa pressed his arm, and murmured her appreciation of his
        cleverness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It won't deceive Douglas for two minutes, if he be, as I
        suspect, the immediate Hound of the Baskervilles, but he may waste some
        time rejoicing [130] over my being such an ass as to try it; and that's
        always a gain.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa began to wonder whether her best chance of ever saying the
        right thing would not be to choose the wrong. His point of view was
        always round the corner of her street! [131]
