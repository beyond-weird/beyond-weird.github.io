        A CERTAIN DAWN UPON OUR OLD FRIEND THE BOULEVARD
        ARAGO; AND OF THE LOVES OF LISA LA GIUFFRIA
        AND ABDUL BEY, HOW THEY PROSPERED. OF
        THE CONCLUSION OF THE FALSE ALARM OF THE GREAT
        EXPERIMENT, AND OF A CONFERENCE BETWEEN DOUGLASS
        AND HIS SUBORDINATES.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        LORD ANTONY BOWLING was one of three men in the War Office who
        could speak French perfectly; despite this drawback, he had been
        selected to confer with the French headquarters in Paris. Here he met
        Cyril Grey, busy with his tailor. The young magician had once held a
        captaincy in a Hussar regiment, but a year of India
        had developed his native love of strange places and peoples. He had been
        tempted to resign his commission, and yielded. He had gone exploring in
        Central Asia, and the deadly districts beyond Assam. He could not stand
        gymkhanas, polo, and flirtation. Simon Iff had given him a hint now and
        again of what magick might effect if a war came, and the boy had
        profited. He had formed provisional plans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He encountered Lord Antony by chance one evening on the Boulevard
        des Italiens, dined him, and on finding that all amusements, even that
        of watching the world from the terrace of a cafe, were to end by order
        of the Military Governor of Paris, at eight o'clock, suggested that they
        should spend the evening smoking opium &quot;chez Zizi,&quot; a
        delightful girl who lived with a brilliant young English journalist
        [307] on the Boulevard M Marcel. At midnight, serenely confident that
        God was in his heaven, as asserted by the late Robert Browning, they
        decided to finish the night at Cyril's studio. Here the young magician
        &quot;reconstructed the crime&quot; of the jumping balls of the
        mysterious countess, and recounted the episode of the Thing in the
        Garden, to the delectation of the &quot;Merman of Mayfair.&quot; He then
        offered to amend Bowling's coat of arms by the introduction of twelve
        prawns couchant, gules,&nbsp; gartered
        azure, and the substitution of Poltergeists for the Wild Men of the
        ducal escutcheon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Modestly disclaiming these heraldic glories, Lord Antony regaled
        his host with an ingenious account of a Swedish gentleman who
        materialized the most voluminous spectres from -- as subsequently
        appeared in circumstances which can only be qualified as dramatic -- the
        contents of a steel cylinder measuring twelve inches in length and three
        in diameter, which a search of the medium, stripped to the buff, had at
        first failed to disclose.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But neither was honestly interested in his own remarks; the
        subconscious excitement of the War made all conversation on any other
        topic sound miserably artificial. Bowling's story made them both
        distrait; they fell into a heavy silence, pondering methods of
        concealing dispatches or detecting spies. Investigation of spiritualism
        makes a capital training-ground for secret service work; one soon gets
        up to all the tricks.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Presently Cyril Grey began to preach magick.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Germany is on a pretty good wicket,&quot; he said.
        &quot;She is at war; we have only taken a holiday to go fighting. The
        first condition of success in magick is purity of purpose. One must let
        no other consideration interfere with the business in hand. But we are
        hypocrites in England; consequently, [308] we compromise and fumble.
        When a magician does get in charge of an affair, all goes pretty well;
        look how Simple Simon has isolated Germany! Even there he has been
        thwarted by the Exchequer; five millions in the right place would have
        bought the Balkans. How much do you think that little economy will cost
        us before we're through? As for the foolishness of leaving Turkey
        doubtful, it's beyond all words!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; agreed Bowling &quot;we ought to have supported
        Abdul Hamid from the first. The best kind of Englishman is blood brother
        to the best kind of Mussulman. He is brave, just, frank, manly and
        proud. We should always be in alliance Islam against the servile Hindus
        and so-called Christians. Where is the spirit of the Paladins and the
        Templars and the Knights of the Round Table? The modern Christian is the
        Bourgeois, whose character is based on fear and falsehood.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There are two kinds of animals, mainly: one whose defence
        is obscurity, shunning death, avoidance of danger; the other whose
        defence is attack.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes; we're all right so long as we make ourselves feared.
        But Victorian prudery turned our tigers into oxen; we found that it was
        wrong fight dangerous to drink beer, wicked to love; presently it was
        cruel to eat beef, immoral to laugh, fatal to breathe. We went in terror
        of the omnipresent germ. Hence we are fat, cowardly slaves. I hear that
        Kitchener is hard put to it to get his first 100,000 men. Only the
        public schools respond. Only gentlemen and sportsmen really love England
        -- the people that have been cursed these last few years as tyrants and
        libertines.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Only the men.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And few there are, in the crowd of canaille, old women,
        slackers, valetudinarians, eaters of nuts!&quot; [309]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;God rest the soul of Edward Seventh! I thought all would be
        well when Victoria died; but now ---&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This is no hour of the night to lapse into poetry! Anyhow,
        Germany is nearly as bad, with her Social Democratic Party.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do you think that?&quot; cried Cyril, sharply, sitting up.
        His gesture was indecipherably intense; it seemed utterly disproportionate
        to Bowling's casual commonplace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I know it. It's one of the chief causes of the war. The
        Zabern incident showed the Junkers that they were safe only for a year
        or two; after that the people would start out to be too proud to
        fight,&quot; replied Lord Antony, anticipating a transpontine chameleon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And so?&quot; Cyril's voice trembled. A tense thrill ran
        through his body. He had become sober in an instant.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The Court Party wanted war, to bring back the manly spirit
        to the nation, and incidentally to keep their place in the sun.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The boy sank with a large sigh into his seat. His tone changed to
        its old supercilious slurring.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Bloody Bill was afraid for his dynasty?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Scared green.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't talk for five minutes, there's a good chap! I've a
        strange feeling come over me -- almost as if I were going to
        think!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Antony obliged with silence. The five minutes became twenty.
        Then Cyril spoke.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I had better get to Cripps double quick,&quot; said he;
        &quot;I'm his Intelligence Officer, and I think it my duty to inform him
        of the plans of the German Great General Staff!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, you should certainly do that!&quot; answered Lord
        Antony, laughing. [310]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then let's stroll up the Boulevard. Dawn's breaking. We'll
        get a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cafe-brioche</i> at the
        Rotonde, and then I'll tyrannize my tailor, and get off.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They went out into the cold morning air. Three hundred yards
        away, outside the Sante prison, a small crowd had collected. The centre
        of attraction seemed to be a framework, two narrow uprights crowned with
        a cross-bar where a triangular piece of metal glittered in the pale
        twilight.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war!&quot;
        drawled Cyril, cynically. &quot;Confess that I have entertained you
        royally! Here is a choice savoury to wind up our feast.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Antony could not conceal his horror and repulsion. For he
        knew well enough what sight chance had prepared for them. But the
        fascination drew him far more surely than if his temperament had
        resembled that of his friend. They approached the crowd. A ring was kept
        about the framework by a cordon of police.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Just then the gates of the prison opened, and a little procession
        came out. All eyes were drawn instantly to its central figure, an old,
        old man whose jaw was dropped, and from whose throat issued a hoarse
        howling, utterly monotonous and inhuman. His eyes were starting from his
        head, and their expression was one not to be described. His arms were
        bound tightly to his sides. Two men were half supporting him, half
        pushing him. Save for
        his horrible cry, there was no sound. There was no movement in the crowd
        -- no whisper. Like automata the officials did their duty. In a trice
        the prisoner was thrown forward on to a board, thrust up toward the
        framework. His caterwaul suddenly ceased. A moment later a sharp order
        rang out in the voice of one of the prison
        officials. The knife fell. From the crowd burst a most dreadful sound --
        an &quot;Ah!&quot; so [311] low, so fierce, that it had no human
        quality. Lord Antony Bowling could never be sure whether it was after
        that or before it that he heard the head tumble into the basket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Who was it?&quot; asked Cyril of a bystander.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Un anglais,&quot; answered the man. &quot;Le docteur
        Balloch.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril started back. He had not recognized his old enemy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But even at that moment he was accosted by one whom he would
        never fail to know, even dressed&nbsp; as
        he was in the uniform of&nbsp; French
        colonel -- Douglas. On his arm was a child whose eyes were blear already
        with debauchery, who staggered, her eyes rolling, her hair dishevelled,
        her mouth loose and wet, laughing with indecent and profane
        intoxication.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Good morning, Captain Grey; well met, well met
        indeed!&quot; began Douglas, urbane in his triumph.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I trust you passed a pleasant time in Naples.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Very pleasant,&quot; returned Grey.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Dr. Balloch,&quot; continued Douglas, &quot;crossed my
        path. I am glad you should have seen the end of him.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am glad,&quot; said Cyril.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And what end do you think I have reserved for you?&quot;
        said the sorcerer, with sudden foam of ferocity.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Something charming, I am sure,&quot; said Cyril, silkily.
        &quot;I always admired your work, you know. That translation of 'The
        Book of the Sacred Magick of Abramelin the Mage,' in particular. You
        remember the passage about the wicked Antony of Prague,&quot; he went
        on, with sudden force and solemnity, &quot;the marvellous things he did,
        and how he prospered -- and how he was found by the roadside, his tongue
        torn out, and the dogs at feast upon his bowels! Do you know what has
        saved you so far? Only one [312] bar between you and destruction -- the
        love of your wife, whom you have murdered!&quot; With that Cyril cried
        aloud three words in a strange tongue, and giving the other no chance to
        reply, marched rapidly away with his friend.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas could not have recovered, in any case. He was as one
        stunned. How did this boy know of the death of his wife? Well, that
        might be understood; but how did he know his most secret fear, the fact
        that since the crime his demons had lost their courage? He shook the
        feeling off, and turned again to gloat over the death of Balloch.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Who was that?&quot; asked Bowling.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The Grand Panjandrum himself, with the little round button
        on top! That's Douglas!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The Black Lodge man?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ex-man.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I see daylight. Balloch was condemned, you know, for a
        crime done twenty years ago. Douglas must have known about it and
        betrayed him.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That's the regular thing.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How does he come to be a colonel in the French Army?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't know. He was close in with one or two ministers;
        Becasseux, I think, in particular. There's a lot of politics in
        Occultism, as you know.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'll think that over. I might ask the minister this
        morning. But I tell you it's no time for trifles. Ever since all the
        mobilization plans were scrapped by the failure of Liege and Namur to
        hold out, distraction has reigned supreme, no casual mistress, but a
        wife, and procuress to the Lords of Hell at that!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do not quote Tennyson, even mixed, under the shadow of the
        Lion de Belfort! As to trifles, there are none in war. Ask the Germans
        if you don't believe me.&quot; [313]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A little later, after the Rotonde Cafe' in the Boulevard
        Montparnasse had refreshed them with its admirable coffee, and those
        brioches which remind one of boyhood's earliest kisses, they walked down
        to the Place de la Concorde, and parted.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril went on to the Opera, to his tailor in the Rue de la Paix.
        His mind was full of meditations upon the details of the great idea that
        had come to him, the divination of the enemy's objective. His suggestion
        had made Lord Antony laugh. He himself had never felt less like
        laughing; he was on fire with creative genius -- and terrified lest his
        work should fall upon barren soil. Well he knew how hard it is to get
        Power to listen to Reason!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the corner of the Place de l'Opera he lifted his eyes to
        assure himself of a free crossing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        *
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The mind of Abdul Bey was in turmoil. His first night upon the
        yacht had been mere wallowing in debauch; but he woke with a clear head,
        acutely alive to the complexity of his situation. He was personally
        triumphant; there was nothing in his private affairs to worry him. But
        in charge, as he was, of the Turkish Secret Service in Paris, he knew
        the political situation well enough. He knew that Turkey would throw in
        her lot with Germany, sooner or later; and he was doubtful as to the
        wisdom of returning to France. On the other hand, duty called him with
        clarion voice; and he wanted to have as many fingers as possible in the
        pie. After much consideration, he thought he would land at Barcelona,
        and get through with his American passport -- for he had papers from
        most nations -- as a distracted millionaire. His companions -- both
        American citizens -- would aid the illusion. Supposing that there was
        already trouble or suspicion, this subterfuge [314] would serve; once in
        Paris, he could find out how the land lay, and act accordingly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He gave orders to the captain to make for Catalonia. The voyage
        was uneventful, save for the brief visit of a cruiser which discovered
        nothing contraband; in fact, Abdul and Lisa remained drunk the whole
        time. Only, just off the Spanish coast, a capful of wind once again
        interfered with Lisa's enjoyment of the honeymoon. It had another
        consequence, more serious. No sooner had they landed at Barcelona, than
        Lisa became suddenly and terribly ill. After a week, the doctors decided
        upon a radical remedy-operation. The next day a girl child entered the
        world, very much alive, despite the irregularity of her entrance. No
        ordinary child, either. She was a beautifully made baby, with deep blue
        eyes; and she was born with four teeth, and with hair six inches long,
        so fair as to be silvery white. Like a tattoo-mark, just over the heart,
        was a faint blue crescent.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa recovered rapidly from her illness, but not too quickly for
        the amorous Turk; though he was surprised and annoyed to find that she
        had recovered her early grace and activity. The fat had gone from her in
        the three weeks of illness; and when she began to be able to move about,
        and drive in the city, she looked once more almost as she did on the
        night when Cyril first saw her, a gay, buxom, vigorous woman. The change
        cooled Abdul's ardour, and her own feelings altered with it. Her lover's
        sloppiness began to disgust her. As to the child, it was a source of
        irritation to both of them. Cremers, again, was hardly a boon companion;
        she would have depressed a hypochondriac going to the funeral of a
        beloved uncle who had left him nothing. Before Lisa had been out of bed
        three days, a crisis arose; she felt instinctively that Paris would be
        &quot;no fun,&quot; and [315] wanted to go
        to America. Abdul felt that he must lose no time in getting to Paris.
        Cremers, for some reason, had changed her mind about reporting to
        Douglas; she was homesick for West 186th Street, so she said. The
        explosion came at lunch, the Spanish nurse having failed to muffle the
        baby with due adequacy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh hell!&quot; said Abdul Bey.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;God knows, I don't want the little beast!&quot; said its
        proud mother.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look'e here!&quot; remarked Cremers. &quot;I do want it.
        Sure some baby!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh hell!&quot; repeated Abdul Bey.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look'e here! You gimme the rocks, an' I'll take her across
        the pond. There's ships. Gimme three thousand bucks and expenses, and
        three thousand every year, and I'll fix it. You folks get off and paint
        Paree pink. Is it a go?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul Bey brightened immediately. Only one thought chilled him.
        &quot;What about Douglas?&quot; he said.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'll `tend to that.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's a good scheme,&quot; muttered Lisa.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Let's get away to-night; I'm sick of this hole.&quot; She
        caressed the Turk warmly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Paris was no longer the Paris of her dreams, no longer the
        Paris of idleness and luxury &quot;where good Americans go when they
        die&quot;; it was a Paris of war, of stern discipline, of patriotic
        enthusiasm, nothing less than a nightmare for the compatriots of the
        lady who didn't raise her boy to be a soldier. She blamed Abdul, who
        shrugged his shoulders, and reminded her that she was lucky to get
        dinner at all, that the Germans were likely
        to be in the city in a week or so. She taunted him; he let loose his
        ancestral feelings about women, those which lie deep-buried in all of us
        who are at least not utterly [316] degenerate in soul, however loose
        morality may have corrupted us upon the surface. She rose in the
        automobile, just as they crossed the Place de l'Opera, and broke her
        parasol over his head; then turned her nails loose on his eyes. He
        fisted her in the abdomen, and she collapsed into the seat of the car
        with a scream. It was this that diverted the attention of Cyril Grey
        from his contemplation of the designs of Germany.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The boy made a leap, and had Abdul by the throat in a moment,
        dragging him out of the car, and proceeding to administer summary
        castigation with his boot. But the police interfered; three men rode up
        with drawn sabres, and put an end to the affair. They arrested all
        parties, and Cyril Grey only escaped by the exhibition of that paper
        which had won him such respect months earlier on the shambles of Moret
        railway station.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I have to go to my tailor: service of the minister,&quot;
        he remarked with a cynical smile; and was dismissed with the profoundest
        respect.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;After all, it was no business of mine,&quot; he muttered as
        he wriggled into his new tunic, to the immense admiration of the tailor,
        a class whose appreciation of manly beauty depends so largely upon the
        price of the suit. &quot;'Tis better to have loved and lost than never
        to have loved at all. The trouble comes when you can't lose `em. Poor
        old Lisa! Poor old Abdul! Well, as I said, it's none of my business. My
        business is to divine the thoughts of the enemy, and -- oh Lord! how
        long? -- to get the powers that be to understand that I am right.
        Considering that they
        needed eight million marching men to persuade them that Bloody Bill
        meant war, I fear that my task may be no sinecure.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He went to the barracks, where a military automobile was waiting
        for him, and told the chauffeur, with bitter wit, to go out to meet
        General Cripps. [317] As to Lisa and the Turk, it was twenty-four hours
        before they were set at liberty. The sight of Cyril, his prompt
        intervention in her defence, relit the flames of her half crazy passion.
        She rushed over to the studio to see him; it was shut up, and the
        concierge could give her no news. She drove wildly to the Profess-House
        in Montmartre. There they told her that he had gone to join the British
        army. Various excited enquiries in official quarters led her at last to
        Lord Antony Bowling. He was genuinely sympathetic: he had liked the girl
        at first sight; but he could hold out no hopes of arranging for her to
        see him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There's only one way for you to get to the front,&quot;
        said he. &quot;Join the Red Cross. My sister's here forming a section.
        I'll give you a note to her, if you like.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa jumped at the suggestion. She saw, more vividly than if it
        were actual, the obvious result. Cyril would be desperately wounded,
        leading the last victorious charge of the dragoons against the walls of
        Berlin; she would interestingly nurse him back to life, probably by
        means of transfusion of blood; then, raised to the peerage, Marshal Earl
        Grey of Cologne (where he had swum the Rhine, and, tearing the keys of
        the city from the trembling hands of the astonished burgomaster, had
        flung them back across the river to his hesitating comrades) would lead
        her, with the Victoria Cross in gold and diamonds on his manly bosom, to
        the altar at St. Margaret's, Westminster.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was worth while learning magick to become clairvoyant like
        this! She dashed off, still at top speed, to enroll herself with Lady
        Marcia Bowling.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She gave no further thought to Abdul. He would never have
        attracted her, had she not perceived a difficulty in getting him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As to that gentleman himself, if grief tore at his [318] heart
        strings, he showed it that night in an unusual way. It may have been but
        simulation of philosophical fortitude; there is no need to enquire. His
        actions are of more interest: they consisted of picking up a cocotte on
        the Boulevard des Italiens, and taking her to dinner at the Cafe de
        Paris. At the conclusion of a meal which would have certainly been
        prescribed as a grief-cure to any but a dyspeptic, the maitre d'hotel
        approached their table, and tendered, with a bow, an envelope. Abdul
        opened it -- it was a summons from Douglas to appear immediately in his
        presence at the apartment in the Faubourg St. Germain.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Turk had no choice but to comply. He excused himself to his
        fair guest, at the cost of a hundred-franc note, and drove immediately
        to the rendezvous.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas received him with extreme heartiness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A thousand congratulations, dear young man, upon your
        brilliant victory! You have succeeded where older and more learned men
        failed badly. I called you here to-night to tell you that you are now
        eligible for a place in the Fourteen, the Ghaagaael, for a seat is
        vacant since this morning.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They executed Balloch?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas nodded with a gloating smile.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But why did you not save him, master?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Save him! It was I that destroyed him when he tried to
        betray me. Candidates take notice!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul protested his loyalty and devotion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The supreme test,&quot; continued Douglas, &quot;cannot
        conveniently be imposed in time of war. There is too much to do just
        now. But -- as a preliminary -- ?&quot; how do you stand with
        Germany?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul shrank back, startled out of his presence of mind.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Germany!&quot; he stammered at last. &quot;Why, [319]
        Colonel,&quot; (he emphasized the title) &quot;I know nothing. I have no
        instructions from my Government.&quot;He met the eye of his master, and
        read its chill contempt. &quot;I--er--er--&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Dare you play with me?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The young man protested that no such thought had crossed his
        mind.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;In that case,&quot; pursued the sorcerer, &quot;you won't
        know what that means?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas took from his pocket a fifty-franc note. The Turk caught
        it up, his eyes grown momentarily wider with surprise.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Examine it!&quot; said Douglas, coldly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Turkish agent held it to the light. In the figures numbering
        the note were two small pinpricks.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Allah!&quot; he cried. &quot;Then you are ---&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am. You may as well know that my colleague in the Lodge,
        'A.B.', is going to stir up trouble for the British in India. Her
        influence with certain classes of Hindus is very great. For your part,
        you may try discreetly to tamper with the Mussulman section of the
        French troops, the Africans. But be careful -- there is more important
        work to your hand, no less than the destruction of the French armies in
        the field. Now let us see what you can do. I am going to send you to my
        little garden hermitage, where I occasionally appear in the character of
        a great ascetic; there is an old lady there, devoted to me. Have your
        best man there to play Yogi. In the garden -- here's the plan -- is the
        terminal of a wire. There's another in that house where you got baptized
        and married -- remember? Thence there's a cable up Seine to another
        cottage where that old Belgian mystic lives -- the friend of
        Maeterlinck! ha! ha! He's really von Walder, a Dresdener. And he is in
        charge of another cable -- underground three hundred [320] miles, thanks
        to Becasseux, who helped us with the road squads, to a place which by
        now is firmly in the hands of the Crown Prince. So all you have to do is
        to tell your man to sit and pretend to meditate -- and tap. I shall send
        you plenty of information from the front. You will know my agents by a
        nick filed in a trouser-button. Each message will have a number, so that
        you will know if any go astray. All clear?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Admirable. I need not say how proud I am to find that we
        are on the same side. I was very frightened of that uniform!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;L'habit ne fait pas
        le moine,&quot;</i> replied Douglas gaily. &quot;And now, sir, let us
        spend the night discussing our plans in detail -- and some very
        excellent whisky which I happen to have by me.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The spies pursued their double task, with pitiless energy, till
        morning was well broken. Later in the day Douglas left for Soissons. He
        was attached to the French army as chief of a corps of signallers --
        thanks, once again, to the good offices of Becasseux. His plans were
        perfect: they had been cut and dried for over fifteen years. [321]
