        THE&nbsp; MOON OF HONEY, AND ITS
        EVENTS; WITH SUNDRY
        REMARKS ON MAGICK; THE WHOLE ADORNED WITH
        MORAL REFLECTIONS USEFUL TO THE YOUNG</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        THE many-terraced garden of the villa was planted with olive and
        tamarind, orange and cypress; but in the lowest of them all, a crescent
        over whose wall one could look down upon one of the paths that threaded
        the hillside, there was a pavement of white marble. A spring wept from
        the naked rock, and fell into a circular basin; from this small
        streamlets issued, and watered the terrace in narrow grooves, between
        the slabs. This garden was sacred to lilies; and because of its apt
        symbolism, Cyril Grey had chosen it for the scene of Lisa's dedication
        to Artemis. He had set up a small triangular altar of silver; and it was
        upon this that Sister Clara and her disciples came thrice nightly to
        make their incantations. The ritual of the moon might never be
        celebrated during daylight.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Upon the evening of Monday, after the adoration of the setting
        sun, Sister Clara called Lisa aside, and led her to this garden.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There she and the hand-maidens unclothed her, and washed her from
        head to foot in the waters of the sacred spring. Then she put upon her a
        solemn oath that she would follow out the rules of the ritual, not
        speaking to any man except her chosen, not leaving the protection of the
        circle, not communicating with the outer and uninitiated world; but, on
        the other [145] hand, devoting herself wholly to the invocation of the
        Moon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then she clothed her in a specially prepared and consecrated
        garment. It was not of the same pattern as those of the Order; it was a
        loose vestment of pale blue covered with silver tissue; and the secret
        sigils of the moon were woven cunningly upon its hem. It was frail, but
        of great volume; and the effect was that the wearer seemed to be wrapped
        in a mist of moonlight.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In a languid and mysterious chant Sister Clara raised her voice,
        and her acolytes kept accord on their mandolines; it was an incantation
        of fervour and of madness, the madness of things chaste, remote, and
        inscrutable. At the conclusion she took Lisa by the hand, and gave her a
        new name, a mystic name, engraved upon
        a moonstone, set in a silver ring which she put upon her finger. This
        name was Iliel. It had been chosen on account of its sympathy of number
        to the moon; for the name is Hebrew, in which language its characters
        have the value of 81, the square of 9, the sacred number of the moon.
        But other considerations helped to determine the choice of this name.
        The letter L in Hebrew refers to Libra, the sign under which she had
        been born; and it was surrounded with two letters, I, to indicate her
        envelopment by the force of creation and chastity which the wise men of
        old hid in that hieroglyph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The final &quot;EL&quot; signified the divinity of her new being;
        for this is the Hebrew word for God, and is commonly attached by the
        sages to divers roots, to imply that these ideas have been manifested in
        individuals of angelic nature.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This instruction had been given to Lisa in advance; now that it
        was ceremonially conferred upon her, she was struck to the heart by its
        great meaning. Her passion for Cyril Grey had been gross and vehement,
        [146] almost vulgar; he had translated it into terms of hunger after
        holiness, of awful aspiration, of utter purity. Nor Rhea Silvia, nor
        Semele, nor any other mortal virgin had ever glowed to inherit more
        glorious a destiny, to feel such infinite exaltation of chastity. Even
        the thought of Cyril himself fell from her like a stain. He had become
        no more than
        a necessary evil. At that moment she could have shaken off the trammels
        of humanity itself, and joined Sister Clara in her ecstatic mood, passed
        on, imperial votaress, in maiden meditation fancy-free. Only the
        knowledge of her sublime task inured her to its bitter taste. From these
        meditations she was awakened by the voice
        of Sister Clara.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, Iliel! Oh, Iliel! Oh, Iliel! there is a cloud upon the
        sea.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The, two girls chimed in with the music of their mandolins.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is growing dark. I am afraid,&quot; cried Sister Clara.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The girls quavered in their melody.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We are alone in the sacred grove. Oh, Artemis, be near us,
        protect us from all evil!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Protect us from all evil!&quot; echoed the two children.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There is a shape in the cloud; there is a stirring in the
        darkness; there is a stranger in the sacred grove!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Artemis! Artemis! Artemis!&quot; shrilled the girls, their
        instruments fierce and agitated.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At that moment a great cry arose from the men, who were in
        waiting on the upper Terrace. It was a scream of abject fear,
        inarticulate, save for the one word &quot;Pan!&quot; They fled shrieking
        in every direction as Cyril Grey, clad in a rough dress of goatskins,
        bounded from the topmost terrace into their midst. In another moment,
        leaping down the garden, he [147] reached the parapet that overlooked
        the little terrace where the girls crouched, moaning.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He sprang down among them; Sister Clara and her disciples fled
        with cries like startled sea-birds; but he crushed Iliel to his breast,
        then flung her over his shoulder, and strode triumphant to the house.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Such was the magical ceremony devised by the adept, a
        commemoration or dramatic representation of the legend of the capture of
        Diana by Pan. It is, of course, from such rites that all dramatic
        performance developed. The idea is to identify oneself, in thought by
        means of action, with the deities whom one desires to invoke.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The idea of presenting a story ceremonially may have preceded the
        ritual, and the Gods may have been mere sublimations of eponymous heroes
        or personifications of abstract ideas; but ultimately it is much the
        same. Admit that the genius of man is divine, and the question
        &quot;Which is the cart, and which the horse?&quot; becomes as pointless
        as if one asked it about an automobile.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The ensuing month, from the middle of November until the week
        before Christmas, was a honeymoon. But animal appetite was scarce more
        than an accidental adjunct; the human love of Cyril and Lisa had been
        raised to inconceivable heights by the backbone of spirituality and love
        of mankind that hay behind its manifestations. Moreover, everything was
        attuned to it; nothing detracted from it. The lovers never lost sight of
        each other for an hour; they had their fill and will of love; but in a
        way, and with an intensity, of which worldly lovers never dream.
        Even sleep was to them but as a veil of many colours cast upon their
        rapture; in their dreams they still pursued each other, and attained
        each other, beneath bluer skies, upon seas that laughed more [148]
        melodiously than that which lay between them and Capri, through gardens
        of more gladness than their own, and upon slopes that stretched
        eternally to the palaces of the Empyrean.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For four weeks no word came from outside; with one exception,
        when Sister Clara brought a telegram to Cyril. It was unsigned, and the
        message curt. &quot;About August First&quot; was all its purport.
        &quot;The better the day, the better the deed!&quot; cried Cyril gaily.
        Iliel questioned him. &quot;Just magick!&quot; he answered. She did not
        pursue the subject: she divined that the matter did not concern her, and
        she regretted even that microscopical interruption.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But although Iliel was kept from all knowledge of external
        events, it was by dint of steel. The Black Lodge had not been idle;
        Brother Onofrio, in charge of the garrison, had found his hands full.
        But his manoeuvres had been successful; the enemy had not even secured
        their first point of vantage, a material link with the Brotherhood.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is a law of magick that causes and effects lie on the same
        plane. You may be able to send a ghost to frighten someone you dislike,
        but you must not expect the ghost to use a club, or steal a pocket
        handkerchief. Also, most practical magick starts on the material plane,
        and proceeds to create images on other planes. Thus, to evoke a spirit,
        you first obtain the objects necessary for its manifestation, and create
        subtler forms of the same nature from them. 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Butterfly-net was worked on exactly the same lines. Morality
        enters into magick no more than into art or science. It is only when the
        effects react upon the moral nature of man that this question arises.
        The Venus de Medici is neither good nor bad; it is merely beautiful; but
        its reaction on the mind of an Antony Comstock or a harry Thaw may be
        disastrous, owing to the nature of such minds. One can settle [149] the
        details of a murder over the telephone; but one should not blame the
        telephone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The laws of magick are closely related to those of other physical
        sciences. A century or so ago men were ignorant of a dozen important
        properties of matter; thermal conductivity, electrical resistance,
        opacity to the X-ray, spectroscopic reaction, and others even more
        occult. Magick deals principally with certain physical forces still
        unrecognized by the vulgar; but those forces are just as real, just as
        material -- if indeed you can call them so, for all things are
        ultimately spiritual -- as properties like radio-activity, weight and
        hardness. The difficulty in defining and measuring them lies principally
        in the subtlety of their relation to life. Living protoplasm is
        identical with dead protoplasm in all but the fact of life. The Mass is
        a magical ceremony performed with the object of endowing a material
        substance with divine virtue; but there is no material difference
        between the consecrated and the unconsecrated wafer. Yet there is an
        enormous difference in the moral reaction upon the communicant.
        Recognizing that its principal sacrament is only one of an infinite
        number of possible experiments in talismanic magic,
        the Church has never denied the reality of that Art, but treated its
        exponents as rivals. She dare not lop the branch on which she sits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        On the other hand, the sceptic, finding it impossible to deny the
        effects of ceremonial consecration, is compelled to refer the cause to
        &quot;faith&quot;; and sneers that Faith is the real miracle. Whereupon
        the Church smilingly agrees; but the magician, holding the balance
        between the disputants, and insisting upon the unity of Nature, asserts
        that all force is one in origin. He believes in the &quot;miracle,&quot;
        but maintains that it is exactly the same kind of miracle as charging a
        Leyden Jar with electricity. You must use a moral [150] indicator to
        test one, an electrical indicator to test the other; the balance and the
        test-tube will not reveal the change in either.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Black Lodge knew well enough that the weak strand in the
        Butterfly-net was Lisa's untrained mind. Its white-hot flame of
        enthusiasm, radiating passionate love, was too active to assail
        directly, even could they have succeeded in communicating with it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But they were content to watch and wait for the reaction, should
        it come, as they knew it must ultimately do. Eros finds Anteros always
        on his heels; soon or late, he will be supplanted, unless he have the
        wit to feed his fire with the fuel of Friendship. In the meanwhile, it
        was the best chance to work upon the mind through the body. Had they
        been able to procure a drop of Iliel's blood, she might have been as
        easy a prey as that unlucky engine-driver of the Paris-Rome <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">rapide</i>.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Sister Clara saw to it that not so much as a nail-paring of
        Iliel escaped careful magical destruction; and Brother Onofrio organized
        a nightly patrol of the garden, so that no physical breach of the circle
        should be made.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The man in charge of the mission of the Black Lodge was one
        Arthwait, a dull and inaccurate pedant without imagination or real
        magical perception. Like most Black Magicians, he tippled habitually;
        and his capacity for inflicting damage upon others was limited by his
        inordinate conceit. He hated Cyril Grey as much as he hated any one,
        because his books had been reviewed by that bright spirit, in his most
        bitterly ironical strain, in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Emerald Tablet</i>, the famous literary review edited by Jack Flynn; and
        Grey had been at particular pains to point out elementary blunders in
        translation which showed that Arthwait was comically ignorant of the
        [151] languages in which he boasted scholarship. But he was not the man
        for the task set him by Douglas; his pomposity always stood in his way;
        a man fighting for life is exceptionally a fool if he insists on
        stopping every moment to admire
        himself. Douglas had chosen him for one of the curious back-handed
        reasons which so often appeal to people of perverse intelligence: it was
        because he was harmless that he was selected to work harm. A democracy
        often chooses its generals on the same principle; a capable man might
        overthrow the republic. It apparently prefers to be overthrown by a
        capable enemy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Douglas had backed him with a strong executive.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul Bey knew no magic, and never would; but he had a desperate
        passion for Lisa, and a fanatical hatred of Grey, whom he credited, at
        the suggestion of Balloch, with the death of his father. He had almost
        unlimited resources, social and financial; there could hardly have been
        a better man for the external part of the work.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The third commissioner was the brains of the business. He was a
        man highly skilled in black magic in his own way. He was a lean,
        cadaverous Protestant-Irishman named Gates, tall, with the scholar's
        stoop. He possessed real original talent, with now and then a flash of
        insight which came close to genius. But though his intellect was keen
        and fine, it was in some way confused; and there was a lack of virility
        in his make-up. His hair was long, lank
        and unkempt; his teeth were neglected; and he had a habit of physical
        dirt which was so obvious as to be repulsive even to a stranger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But there was no harm in him; he had no business in the Black
        Lodge at all; it was but one of his romantic phantasies to pose as a
        terribly wicked fellow. Yet he took it seriously enough, and was [152]
        ready to serve Douglas in any scheme, however atrocious, which would
        secure his advancement in the Lodge. He was only there through
        muddle-headedness; so far as he had an object beyond the satisfaction of
        his vanity, it was innocent in itself -- the acquisition of knowledge
        and power. He was entirely the dupe of Douglas, who found him a useful
        stalking-horse,
        for Gates had a considerable reputation in some of the best circles in
        England.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas had chosen him for this business on excellent points of
        cunning; for he neither hated nor loved his intended victims, and so was
        likely to interpret their actions without passion or prejudice. It was
        this interpretation that Douglas most desired. Douglas had seen him
        personally -- rare privilege -- before he left for Naples and explained
        his wishes somewhat as follows.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The fool Arthwait was to blunder pedantically along with the
        classical methods of magical assault, partly on the chance of a hit,
        partly to keep Grey busy, and possibly to lead him to believe that the
        main attack lay there. Meanwhile he, Gates, was to devote himself, on
        the quiet, to divining the true nature of Grey's purpose. This
        information was essential; Douglas knew that it must be something
        tremendous; that the forces which Cyril was working
        to evoke were cosmic in scope. He knew it not only from his own
        divinations, but deduced it from the fact of the intervention of Simon
        Iff. He knew well that the old Master would not have lifted a finger for
        anything less than a world-war. Douglas therefore judged that if he
        could defeat Grey's purpose, it would involve the triumph of his own.
        Such forces, recoiling upon his head who had evoked them, would shatter
        him into a thousand
        fragments. Douglas, still weak from the destruction of his
        &quot;watcher,&quot; was particularly clear on this point! [153]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arthwait was to be the nominal head of the party in all things,
        and Abdul Bey was to be urged to support him vigorously in all ways that
        lay in his power; but if necessary Gates was to thwart Arthwait, and
        secure the allegiance of the Turk, bound to secrecy on the matter, by
        showing him a card which Douglas then and there duly inscribed and
        handed over.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Louis XV tried a double-cross game of this sort on his
        ambassadors; but Douglas was not strong on history, and knew nothing of
        how those experiments resulted.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Nor, apparently, had he taken to heart the words of the gospel:
        &quot;If Satan be divided against Satan, how shall his kingdom
        stand?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Still less did he realize that this ingenious plan had been
        suggested to him by Simon Iff! Yet it was so: this was the head of the
        counter-attack which the old mystic had agreed to deliver on behalf of
        Cyril Grey. It was only a quarter of an hour's work; the Way of the Tao
        is the easiest as it is the surest.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is what &quot;Simple Simon&quot; had done. Since all simple
        motion is one-pointed, and its enemy is inertia, the swordsmith brings
        his sword to a single sharp edge; the fletcher grinds his arrow-barb to
        a fine point. Your Dum-Dum bullet will not penetrate as does your nickel
        tip; and you cannot afford to use the former unless the power of
        penetration is so great as to reach the soft spots before the bullet
        expands and stops. This mechanical principle is perfectly applicable in
        magick. Therefore, when there is need to resist a magical attack, your
        best method will be to divide your antagonist's forces.

        Douglas had already lost a pawn in the game, Akbar Pasha having
        gone to his destruction through setting up an idea of his own, apart
        from, and inconsistent with, the plan of his superior. The defect is
        inherent in all Black Magic, because that art is itself [154] a thing
        set up against the Universal Will. If it were not negligibly small, it
        would destroy the Universe, just as the bomb-throwing Anarchist would
        succeed in destroying society if he amounted to, say, a third of the
        population.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now Simple Simon, at this time, did not know Douglas for the
        enemy General; but he was in the closest possible magical touch with
        him. For he had absorbed the Thing in the garden into himself and that
        Thing had been a part of Douglas.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So he set himself to the complete assimilation of that Thing; he
        made certain that it should be part of himself for ever. His method of
        doing this was as simple as usual. He went over the Universe in his
        mind, and set himself to reconcile all contradictions in a higher Unity.
        Beginning with such gross things as the colours of the spectrum, which
        are only partialities of white light, he resolved everything that came
        into his mind until he reached such abstractions as matter and motion,
        being and form; and by this process worked himself up into a state of
        mind which was capable of grasping those sublime ideas which unite even
        these ultimate antinomies. That was all.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas, still in magical touch with that &quot;watcher,&quot;
        could feel it being slowly digested, so to say, by some other magician.
        This (incidentally) is the final fate of all black magicians, to be torn
        piecemeal, for lack of the love which grows by giving itself to the
        beloved, again and again, until its &quot;I&quot; is continuous with
        existence itself. &quot;Whoso loveth his life shall lose it&quot; is the
        corresponding scriptural phrase.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So Douglas, who might at that moment have saved himself by
        resignation, was too blind to see the way -- an acquired blindness
        resulting from repeated acts whose essence was the denial of the unity
        of himself with the rest of the universe. And so he [155] fought
        desperately against the assimilation of his &quot;watcher.&quot;
        &quot;It's mine, not yours!&quot; he raged. To the steady and continuous
        affirmation of true unity in all diversity which Simon Iff was making,
        he opposed the affirmation of duality. The result was that his whole
        mind was aflame with the passion of contrasting
        things, of playing forces off against each other. When it came to
        practical decisions, he divided his forces, and deliberately created
        jealousy and hatred where co-operation and loyalty should have been the
        first and last consideration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet Simon Iff had used no spell but Love. [156]
