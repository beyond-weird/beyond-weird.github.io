        <p align="center">OF
        THE THING IN THE GARDEN; AND OF THE WAY OF THE TAO
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;OH, little Brother!&quot; said the old mystic sadly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How long will it take you to work through this wretched
        business?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I have omnipotence at my command, and eternity at my
        disposal,&quot; smiled the boy, using Eliphaz Levi's well-known formula.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I ought to explain,&quot; said Simple Simon, turning to
        Lisa. &quot;This boy is a desperate magician confined within the circle
        of this forest. His plan is Action; he is all for Magick; give him a
        Wand and a host of Demons to control, and he is happy. For my part, I
        prefer the Way of the Tao, and to do everything by doing nothing. I know
        it sounds difficult; one day I will explain. But the practical result is
        that I lead a placid and contented life, and nothing ever happens; he,
        on the contrary, makes trouble everywhere, excites the wrath of Turks,
        and worse, if I am right; he thereby brings about a situation where
        perfectly competent ladies' maids have epileptic fits, mediums endeavour
        to procure blood from bewitching damozels -- and now there's a Thing in
        the Garden.&quot; His voice had a wail of comic disgust.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;However, this is Cyril's funeral, not mine. He called me
        in; I must say I approve of his general plan, on the whole, and I dare
        say much&nbsp; of the opposition
        is unavoidable. In any case he is the [64] magician; Principal Boy in a
        Pantomime. I merely hold the sponge; and we have to use his formula
        throughout, not mine. If it ends in disaster,&quot; he added as a
        cheerful afterthought, &quot;perhaps it will teach him a lesson! A
        Chinese God, indeed! He would be better as a Chinese coolie, smoking
        opium at the feet of Chwangtze!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He tells me that I stand in my own way, that I love
        struggle and adventure, and that this is weakness and not strength.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This girl is in danger: quite unnecessary danger.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am going to ask my master to show you his method; you
        will see plenty of mine in the next few weeks; and I should like you to
        have a standard of comparison. Maybe you'll want to choose one
        day!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm afraid I, too, like danger and excitement!&quot; cried
        Lisa.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm afraid you do! However, since Brother Cyril asks it,
        the Way of the Tao shall be trodden so far as this is possible: What
        would Brother Cyril do?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I should take the Magic Sword, make the appropriate
        symbols, and invoke the Names Divine appurtenant thereto: the Thing,
        shrivelled and blasted, would go back to those that sent it, screaming
        in agony, cursing at the gods, ready to turn even on its employers, that
        they might wail with it in torment.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;One of the best numbers on the programme,&quot; said Simon
        Iff. &quot;Now see the other way!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes: if your way is better than that!&quot; cried the girl,
        her eyes gleaming.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It isn't <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">my</i>
        way,&quot; said the mystic, with a sudden inflection of solemnity. His
        voice rose in a low monotonous chant as he quoted from &quot;The Book of
        the Heart girt with the Serpent.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I, and Me, and Mine were sitting with lutes in [65] the
        market-place of the great city, the city of the violets and the roses.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The night fell, and the music of the lutes was stilled.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The tempest arose, and the music of the lutes was stilled.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The hour passed, and the music of the lutes was stilled.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But Thou art Eternity and Space; Thou art Matter and
        Motion; and Thou art the Negation of all these things. For there is no
        symbol of Thee.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The listeners were thrilled to the marrow of their bones. But the
        old man merely gathered a handful of dittany leaves from the chased
        golden box where they were kept, and led the way to the garden.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was very dark; nothing could be distinguished but the outlines
        of the shrubs and the line of the fence beyond.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do you see the Thing?&quot; said Iff.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa strained her eyes.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You mustn't look for anything very definite,&quot; said the
        mystic.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It seems as if the darkness were somehow different in that
        corner,&quot; said Lisa at last, pointing. &quot;A sort of reddish tinge
        to the murk.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh dear me! if you will use words hike 'murk'! I'm afraid
        you're all on Cyril's side! Look now! &quot; And he put his hand on her
        head. With the other he offered her the dittany. &quot;Chew one of these
        leaves!&quot; he said.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She took one of the silver-grey heaves, with its delicate
        snow-bloom, between her teeth.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I can see a sort of shapeless mass, dark-red,&quot; she
        said after a pause.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Now watch!&quot; cried Iff. He took several steps into the
        garden, and raised his right hand. &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the
        whole of the Law!&quot; [66] he proclaimed in such a voice as once shook
        Sinai.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then he threw the rest of the dittany in the direction of the
        Thing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;By all the powers of the Pentagram!&quot; shouted Cyril
        Grey; &quot;he's deliberately making a magical link between it and
        Lisa.&quot; He bit his lip, and cursed himself in silence; he knew he
        had been startled out of prudence.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff had not noticed the outburst. He quoted &quot;The Book
        of the Law,&quot; &quot;Be strong!&quot; he cried. &quot;Enjoy all
        things of sense and rapture! There is no god that shall deny thee for
        this!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Thing became coherent. It contracted slightly. Lisa could now
        see that it was an animal of the wolf type, couchant. The body was as
        big as that of a small elephant. It became quite clearly visible. It was
        a dull fiery red. The head was turned toward her, and she was suddenly
        shocked to see that it had no eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The old man advanced towards it. He had abandoned his prophetic
        attitude. His whole gait expressed indifference -- no, forgetfulness. He
        was merely a quiet old gentleman taking an evening stroll.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He walked right into the Thing. Suddenly, as it enveloped him,
        Lisa saw that a faint light was issuing from his body, a pale
        phosphorescence which kindled warmly as he went. She saw the edges of
        the Thing contract, as if they were sucked inwards. This proceeded, and
        the light became intense. About a burning ovoid core dawned and vibrated
        the flashing colours of the rainbow. The Thing disappeared completely;
        at the same moment the light
        went out. Simon Iff was once again merely an old gentleman taking an
        evening stroll.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But she heard a soft voice, almost as faint as an echo; it
        murmured: &quot;Love is the law, love under will.&quot; [67]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Let us go in,&quot; said he as he rejoined them. &quot;You
        must not catch a chill.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa went to the divan. She said nothing; she was stupefied by
        what she had seen. Perhaps she even lost full consciousness for a
        moment; for her next impression was of the two men arguing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I agree,&quot; Cyril was saying, &quot;it is very neat, and
        shows the&nbsp; restraint of the
        great artist; but I am thinking of the Man behind the gun. I should have
        struck terror into him.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But fear is failure!&quot; protested Iff mildly, as if
        surprised.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But we want them to fail!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh no! I want them to succeed.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril turned rather angrily to Lisa. &quot;He's impossible! I
        fancy myself at paradox, you know; but he goes beyond my understanding
        every time. I'm an amateur, and a rotten amateur at that.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Let me explain!&quot; said Simple Simon. &quot;If everybody
        did his Will, there would be no collision. Every man and every woman is
        a star. It is when we get off our orbits that the clashes come. Now if a
        Thing gets off its orbit, and comes into my sphere of attraction, I
        absorb it as quietly as possible, and the stars sing together
        again.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Whew!&quot; said Cyril, and pretended to wipe the sweat
        from his brow.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But weren't you in danger from that devilish Thing?&quot;
        asked Lisa, with the memory of a great anxiety. She had trembled like an
        aspen during the scene in the garden.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The rhinoceros,&quot; quoted Simon Iff, &quot;finds no
        place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in
        which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And
        for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you did nothing. You were just acting [68] like an
        ordinary man. But I think it would have been death for any one but
        you.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;An ordinary man would not have touched the Thing. It was on
        a different plane, and would no more have interfered with him than sound
        interferes with light. A young magician, one who had opened a gate on to
        that plane, but had not yet become master of that plane, might have been
        overcome. The Thing might even have dispossessed
        his ego, and used his body as its own. That is the beginner's danger in
        magick.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And what is your secret?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;To have assimilated all things so perfectly that there is
        no longer any possibility of strungle. To have destroyed the idea of
        duality. To have achieved Love and Will so that there is no longer any
        object to Love, or any aim for Will. To have killed desire at the root;
        to be one with every thing and with Nothing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look!&quot; he went on, with a change of tone, &quot;why
        does a man die when he is struck by lightning? Because he has a gate
        open to lightning; he insists on being an electrical substance by
        possessing the quality of resistance to the passage of the electric
        current. If we could diminish that resistance to zero, lightning would
        no longer take notice of him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There are two ways of preventing a rise of temperature from
        the sun's heat. One is to oppose a shield of non-conducting and opaque
        material: that is Cyril's way, and at the best it is imperfect; some
        heat always gets through. The other is to remove every particle of
        matter from the space which you wish to be cold; then there is nothing
        there to become hot; and that is the Way of the Tao.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa put an arm round Cyril's neck, and rested her head on his
        shoulder. &quot;I shouldn't know how [69] to begin!&quot; she said:
        &quot;and -- I know it would mean giving up Cyril.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It would mean giving up yourself,&quot; retorted the
        mystic, &quot;and you'll have to do it one day: But be reassured!
        Everybody has to go through your stage -- and unless I'm mistaken, you
        are about to go through it in a particularly acute form.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I've tried the Tao,&quot; said Cyril, half regretful,
        &quot;but I can't manage it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The old man laughed. &quot;You're like the old man in the storm
        who realized that he would be warmer elsewhere. So he decided to
        diminish the amount of himself by removing his clothes, and only found
        it colder. It gets worse and worse till the moment when you vanish
        utterly and for ever. But you have only tried half-measures. Naturally,
        you have found your will divided against itself -- the will to live
        against the will to Nirvana, if I may call it so -- and that is not even
        good magick.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The boy groaned inwardly. He could understand just enough to
        realize how far the heights reached above him. His heart almost failed
        him at the thought -- which was instinctive knowledge -- that he must
        scale them, whether he would or no.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Take care!&quot; suddenly cried Simon Iff.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At almost the same instant a terrible scream shrilled out from a
        neighbouring studio.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is my fault,&quot; murmured the old man, humbly. &quot;I
        divided his will. I have been talking like an old fool. I must have been
        identified with Simon Iff for a moment. Oh, pride! Oh, pride!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Cyril Grey had understood the warning. He rose to his full
        height, and made a curious gesture. Then, with a grim face, he ran out
        of the studio. In a moment he was battering at the door of his
        neighbour. It burst open under the momentum of his shoulder. [70]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A woman lay upon the floor. Over her stood the sculptor, a
        blood-stained hammer in his hand. He seemed absolutely dazed. Grey shook
        him. He looked round stupidly.&quot; What have I done?&quot; he said.
        &quot;Nothing!&quot; snarled Cyril. &quot;I did it, I. Quick! can't we
        save her?&quot; But the sculptor burst into lamentation: he was
        incapable of anything but tears. He flung himself upon the body of his
        model, and wept passionately. Cyril gritted his teeth; the girl
        was on the borderland. &quot;Master!&quot; he cried, in a terrible
        voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;In a case of this kind,&quot; said Simple Simon, who was
        standing unperceived within a foot of him, &quot;where Nature has been
        outraged, an attempt made to interfere violently with her laws, it is
        permissible to act -- or rather, to counteract just so much as is
        necessary to restore equilibrium. There was a seed of quarrel in the
        hearts of these young people; the blow aimed at you, when your own will
        became divided, struck aslant; their own
        division attracted the murder-force to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I will administer The Medicine.&quot; He took a flask from
        his pocket, put a drop of the contents on the lips of the girl, and one
        in each nostril. He then sprinkled a little upon a handkerchief, and put
        it to the wound on her head.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly the sculptor rose to his feet with a great cry. His
        hands were covered in blood, which streamed from his own scalp.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Quick! back to the studio!&quot; said Simon. &quot;We don't
        want to make explanations. They'll both be all right in five minutes,
        and they'll think it all a dream. As, indeed, like the rest of things,
        it is!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Cyril had to carry la Giuffria. The rapid successions of
        these mysterious events had ended by throwing her consciousness
        completely out of gear. She lay in a deep trance. [71]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A very fortunate circumstance!&quot; remarked Simon, when
        he observed it. &quot;This is the time to take her over to the
        Profess-House.&quot; Cyril wrapped her in her furs; between them they
        carried her to the boulevard, where Simon Iff's automobile was in
        waiting.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The old mystic held up his left hand, with two of the fingers
        crossed. It was a signal to the chauffeur. In another moment they were
        running on easy speed up the Boulevard Arago.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa came to herself as the car, crossing the Seine, pointed at
        the heights of Montmartre; and she was perfectly recovered as it stopped
        before a modest house of quite modern type, which was set against the
        steepest part of the hill.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The door opened, without alarm being given. Lisa learnt later
        that in this house no orders needed to be issued, that simplicity had
        reached so serene a level that all things operated together without
        question. Only when unusual accidents took place was there need for
        speech; and little, even then.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The door stood open, and a quite ordinary butler presented
        himself, bowing. Simon Iff returned the salute, and walked on, when a
        second door opened, also spontaneously. Lisa found herself in a small
        lobby. The man who had opened the inner door was clad from neck to knee
        in a single black robe, without sleeves. From his belt hung a heavy
        sword with a cross-hilt. This man held up three fingers. Simon Iff again
        nodded, and led his
        guests to the room on the left.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Here were the three guests indicated by the gesture of the guard.
        Lord Antony Bowling was a familiar friend of the old mystic. He was a
        stout and strong man of nearly fifty years of age, with a gaze both
        intrepid and acute: His nose was of the extreme aristocratic type, his
        mouth sensual and strong. [72]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey had nicknamed him &quot;The Merman of Mayfair&quot;
        and claimed that Rodin got the idea for his&nbsp;
        &quot;Centaur&quot; the day that he met him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He was the younger brother of the Duke of Flint, his race
        probably Norman in the main: but he gave the impression of a Roman
        Emperor. Haughtiness was here, and great good-nature; the intellect was
        evidently developed to the highest possible pitch of which man as man is
        capable; and one could read the judicial habit
        on his deep wide brows. Against this one could see the huge force of the
        man's soul, the passionate desire for knowledge which burnt in that
        great brain. One could conceive him capable of monstrous deeds, for he
        would let no man, no prejudice of men, stand in his way. He would
        certainly have fiddled while Rome was burning if it had been his hobby
        to play the violin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This man was the mainstay of the Society for Psychical Research.
        He was the only absolutely competent man in it, perhaps; at least, he
        stood well above all others. He had the capacity for measuring the
        limits of error in any investigation with great accuracy. Just as the
        skilful climber can make his way on rotten chalk by trusting each
        crumbling fragment with just that fraction of his weight which will not
        quite dislodge it, so Lord Antony could prepare a sound case from
        worthless testimony. He knew the limits of fraud. He might catch a
        medium in the act of cheating a dozen times in a seance, and yet record
        some of the phenomena of that seance as evidential. He used to say that
        the fact of a medium having his hands free did not explain the
        earthquake at Messina.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If this man had ever caused people to distrust his judgment --
        nobody but an imbecile could have doubted his sincerity
        -- the cause lay in his power to fool the mediums he was investigating
        to the top of their bent. He would enter into every phase of their [73]
        strange moods as if he had been absolutely one with them in spirit;
        then, when they were gone, he would withdraw and look at the whole
        course of events from without, as if he had had no share in them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But people who saw him only in the first phase thought him easily
        hoodwinked.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The second of the guests of Simon Iff, or, rather, of the Order
        to which he belonged, was a tall man bowed with ill-health. A shock of
        heavy black hair crowned a face pallid as death itself; but his eyes
        blazed formidably beneath their bushy brows. He had just returned from
        Burma, where he had lived for many years as a Buddhist monk. The
        indomitable moral valour of the man shone from him; one could see in
        every gesture the marks of his fierce
        fight against a dozen deadly sicknesses. With hardly a week of even
        tolerable health in any year, he had done work that might have
        frightened the staff of a great University. Almost single-handed, he had
        explored the inmost doctrine of the Buddha, and thrown light on many a
        tangled grove of thought. He had reorganized Buddhism as a missionary
        religion, and founded societies everywhere to study and practise it. He
        had even found time
        and strength, amid these labours, to pursue his own hobby of electrical
        research. Misunderstood, thwarted, hampered in every way, he had won
        through; and he had never violated the precepts of his Teacher by
        raising his voice to denounce error. Even his enemies had been compelled
        to recognize him as a saint. Simon Iff had never met him, but he went to
        greet Cyril with the affection of a brother. The boy had been the
        greatest of his pupils, but the Mahathera Phang, as he was now called in
        his monastery, had long ago abandoned magick for a path not very
        different from that of Simon Iff.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The third man was of very inferior calibre to [74] either of the
        others. He was of medium height and good build, though somewhat frail.
        But in him was no great development. One divined a restless intelligence
        fettered to mere cleverness, a failure to grasp the distinction between
        genius and talent. He was an expert conjurer, had all the facts of
        psychic research at his finger's end, was up in all the modern theories
        of psychology, but was little
        more than a machine. He was incapable of refuting his own logic by an
        appeal to his common sense. Some one having once remarked that we all
        dig our graves with our teeth, Wake Morningside had started to prove
        scientifically that eating was the direct cause of death; and that,
        consequently, absolute fasting would confer immortality. This was of
        course easy to prove -- in America.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He had continued with experiments in weighing souls,
        photographing thoughts, and would probably have gone fishing for the
        Absolute if he had only thought of it! He was a prop to the editors of
        the New York Sunday Newspapers, and was at present engaged on writing a
        scenario for moving pictures in which he was to incorporate the facts of
        psychical research. Nobody in the world was better aware than he that
        everything reliable could
        be packed into a single reel, and rattle, but he had undauntedly
        contracted for a series of fifty five-part pictures. He chewed his
        chocolate -- his latest specific for averting the perils of more complex
        nutrition -- with no idea that these activities might damage his
        reputation as a research student. And he was really a very clever man,
        with a quick eye and brain. If he had possessed moral force, he might
        have been saved from many of his follies. But his belief in his own fads
        had impaired his health and made him somewhat hysterical; as a result of
        this,
        and of his tendency to exploit his knowledge in second-rate ways, people
        had begun to [75] doubt the value of his testimony even in serious
        matters. For instance. Some years before, he had been one of the
        signatories to a favourable report on a medium named Jansen; the
        following year he had brought the man over to America, and made a great
        deal of money out of the tour. The action destroyed both Jansen and the
        earlier report. In New York the Scandinavian medium had been exposed,
        and when Morningside had objected that this did not invalidate the
        earlier report, his opponent retorted: &quot;No: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Your</i>
        presence there does that!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Bowling, with whom he had just crossed from England, knew him
        better than to think venality of him, and still valued his co-operation
        in the investigations of alleged spiritualistic phenomena for his
        extraordinary skill in conjuring, and his practically complete knowledge
        of every trick that ever had been played, or could be played. In fact,
        he was Bowling's expert witness on the question of the limits of
        possible fraud.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Until Simon Iff and his party entered, these three men had been
        entertained by a woman. She was dressed in a plain purple robe, made in
        a single piece. It fell to her feet. The sleeves were long and widening
        towards the wrist. A red rose, upon a cross of gold, was embroidered on
        the breast. Her rich brown hair was coiled over her ears.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The face of this woman was of extreme beauty, in a certain
        esoteric fancy. Like her whole body, it was sturdy and vigorous, but
        there was infinite delicacy, surprising in so strong a model. Her eyes
        were clear and fearless and true; but one could see that they must have
        served her ill indeed often enough, for they were evidently incapable of
        understanding falsity, and evil. The nose was straight and broad, full
        of energy; and the mouth passionate and firm. The lips were somewhat
        thick, but they were mobile; [76] and the whole expression of the face
        redeemed any defect of any feature. For while its general physical
        aspect was severe, even savage -- she might have been a Tartar beauty,
        the bride of a Gengis Khan, or a South Sea Island Queen, tossing her
        lovers into
        the crater of Mauna Loa after killing them in the excess and fantasy of
        her passion -- yet the soul within shone out and turned the swords to
        plowshares. There was pride, indeed, but only of that kind which is (as
        it were) the buckler on the arm of nobility; the woman was incapable of
        meanness, of treachery, or even of unkindness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There were terrible fires in the depths of that volcano; but they
        had been turned to human service; they had been used to heat the forge
        of art. For this woman was a great singer; and no one outside the Order
        knew of her secret aspirations, or that she retired from time to time to
        one or the other of the Profess-Houses of the Order, there to pursue a
        mightier transmutation of her being.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She greeted Cyril with peculiar warmth -- indeed, it had been she
        to whom he had once thrown a pair of socks. In a way, it was he that had
        made her a great artist; for his personality had broken down her dykes;
        not till she met him had she ever let herself go. And it was by a
        magical trick that he had shown her how to use her art as a vehicle for
        her soul.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Later, he had brought her into the Order, realizing the
        inestimable value of her virtue; and if she was not its most advanced
        member she was its most beloved.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They called her Sister Cybele. [77]
