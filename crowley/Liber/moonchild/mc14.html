        INFORMATIVE DISCOURSE UPON THE OCCULT CHARACTER
        OF THE MOON, HER THREEFOLD NATURE, HER FOURFOLD
        PHASES, AND HER EIGHT-AND-TWENTY MANSIONS;
        WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS THAT PRECEDED
        THE CLIMAX OF THE GREAT EXPERIMENT, BUT
        ESPECIALLY OF THE VISION OF ILIEL</p>
        <p>&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        THE Ancients, whose wisdom is so much despised by those who have
        never studied it, but content themselves with a pretence of
        understanding modern science which deceives nobody, would have smiled to
        observe how often the &quot;latest discoveries&quot; are equivalent to
        some fancy of Aristotle, or some speculation of Heracleitus. The remoter
        Picay-universities of America, which teach farming or mining, with a
        little &quot;useless&quot; knowledge as a side-course,
        for show, are full of bumptious little professors who would not be
        allowed to sweep out a laboratory in London or Berlin. The ambition of
        such persons is to obtain an illustrated interview in a Sunday
        supplement, with a full account of their wonderful discoveries, which
        have revolutionized the art of sucking eggs. They are peculiarly severe
        upon back numbers like Charles Darwin. Their ignorance leads them to
        believe the bombast of
        democracy-flatterers, who scream weekly of Progress, and it really
        appears to them that anything more than six months old is out-of-date.
        They do not know that this is only true of loud-shouted mushroom rubbish
        such as they call truth. [185]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The fundamental difference between ancient and modern science is
        not at all in the field of theory. Sir William Thomson
        was just as metaphysical as Pythagoras or Raymond Lully, and Lucretius
        quite as materialistic as Ernst Haeckel or Buchner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But we have devised means of accurate measurement which they had
        not, and in consequence of this our methods of classification are more
        quantitative than qualitative. The result has been to make much of their
        science unintelligible; we no longer know exactly what they meant by the
        four elements, or by the three active principles, sulphur, mercury, and
        salt. Some tradition has been preserved by societies of wise men, who,
        because of the persecutions, when to possess any other book than a
        missal might be construed as heresy, concealed themselves and whispered
        the old teaching one to another.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The nineteenth century saw the overthrow of most of the old
        ecclesiastical tyranny, and in the beginning of the twentieth it was
        found once more possible to make public the knowledge. The wise men
        gathered together, discovered a student who was trustworthy and
        possessed of the requisite literary ability; and by him the old
        knowledge was revised and made secure; it was finally published in a
        sort of periodical encyclopedia (already almost
        impossible to find, such was the demand for it) entitled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
        Equinox</i>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now in the science of antiquity, much classification depended
        upon the planets. Those things which were hot and fiery in their nature,
        lions, and pepper, and fevers, were classed under the Sun or Jupiter or
        Mars; things swift and subtle under Mercury; things cold and heavy under
        Saturn, and so forth.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet the principles of most of the planets appeared in varying
        proportions in almost everything; and the more equally these proportions
        were balanced and combined, the more complete was anything supposed to
        be, the nearer modelled on the divine perfection. Man himself was called
        a microcosm, a little universe, an image of the Creator. In him all the
        planets and elements had course, and even the Signs of the Zodiac were
        represented in his nature. The energy of the ram was in his head; the
        bull gave the laborious endurance to his shoulders; the lion represented
        the courage of his heart, and the fire of his temper; his knees, which
        help him to spring, are under the goat -- all works in, and is divided
        and subdivided in, beauty and harmony.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In this curious language the moon signifies primarily all
        receptive things, because moonlight is only reflected sunlight. Hence
        &quot;lunar&quot; is almost a synonym of &quot;feminine.&quot; Woman
        changes; all depends upon the influence of the man; and she is now
        fertile, now barren, according to her phase. But on each day of her
        course she passes through a certain section of the Zodiac; and according
        to the supposed nature of the stars beyond her was her influence in that
        phase, or, as they called it, mansion. It was in order to bring Iliel
        into harmony with every quality of the moon that her daily routine was
        ordered.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But beyond such minuteness of detail is the grand character of
        the Moon, which is threefold. For she is Artemis or Diana, sister of the
        Sun, a shining Virgin Goddess; then Isis-initiatrix, who brings to man
        all light and purity, and is the link of his animal soul with his
        eternal self; and she is Persephone or Proserpine, a soul of double
        nature, living half upon earth and half in Hades, because, having eaten
        the pomegranate offered her by its lord, her mother could not bring her
        wholly back to earth; and thirdly, she is Hecate, a thing altogether of
        Hell, barren, hideous and malicious, the queen of death and evil
        witchcraft. [187]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All these natures are combined in woman. Artemis is unassailable,
        a being fine and radiant; Hecate is the crone, the woman past all hope
        of motherhood, her soul black with envy and hatred of happier mortals;
        the woman in the fullness of life is the sublime Persephone, for whose
        sake Demeter cursed the fields that they brought forth no more corn,
        until Hades consented to restore her to earth for half the year. So this
        &quot;moon&quot; of the ancients has a true psychological meaning, as
        sound to-day as when the priest of Mithras slew the bull; she is the
        soul, not the eternal and undying sun of the true soul, but the animal
        soul which is a projection of it, and is subject to change and sorrow,
        to the play of all the forces of the universe, and whose
        &quot;redemption&quot; is the solution of the cosmic problem. For it is
        the seed of the woman that shall bruise the serpent's head; and this is
        done symbolically by every woman who wins to motherhood.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Others may indeed be chaste unto Artemis, priestesses of a holy
        and ineffable rite; but with this exception, failure to attain the
        appointed goal brings them into the dark side of the moon, the cold and
        barren house of Hecate the accursed.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It will be seen how wide is the range of these ideas, how
        sensitive is the formula of woman, that can touch such extremes,
        springing often from one to the other in a moment -- according to the
        nature of the influence then at work upon her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey had once said, speaking at a Woman's Suffrage Meeting:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Woman has no soul, only sex; no morals, only moods; her
        mind is mob-rule; therefore she, and she only, ought to Vote.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He had sat down amid a storm of hisses; and received fourteen
        proposals of marriage within the next twenty-four hours. [188]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Ever since the beginning of the second stage of the Great
        Experiment, Iliel had become deffinitely a Spirit of the Moon While
        Cyril was with her, she reflected him, she clung to him, she was one
        with him, Isis to his Osiris, sister as well as spouse; and every
        thought of her mind being but the harmonic of his, there was no
        possibility of any internal disturbance.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But now she was torn suddenly from her support; she could not
        even speak to her man; and she discovered her own position as the mere
        centre of an Experiment.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She knew now that she was not of scientific mind; that her
        aspirations to the Unknown had been fully satisfied by mere love; and
        that she would have been much happier in a commonplace cottage. It says
        much for the personality of Sister Clara, and the force of her
        invocations, that this first impulse never came to so much as a word.
        But the priestess of Artemis took hold of her almost with the violence
        of a lover, and whisked her away into
        a languid ecstasy of reverie. She communicated her own enthusiasm to the
        girl, and kept her mind occupied with dreams, faery-fervid, of uncharted
        seas of glory on which her galleon might sail, undiscovered countries of
        spice and sweetness, Eldorado and Utopia and the City of God.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The hour of the rising of the moon was always celebrated by an
        invocation upon the terrace consecrated to that planet. A few minutes
        earlier Iliel rose and bathed, then dressed herself in the robes, and
        placed upon her head the crescent-shaped tiara, with its nine great
        moonstones. In this the younger girls took turns to assist her. When she
        was ready, she joined the other girl, and together they went down to the
        terrace, where Sister Clara would be ready to begin the invocations.
        [189]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Of course, owing to the nature of the ceremony, it took place an
        hour later every day; and at first Iliel found a difficulty
        in accommodating herself to the ritual. The setting of the moon
        witnessed a second ceremony, directly from which she retired to her bed.
        It was part of the general theory of the operation thus to keep her
        concealed and recumbent for the greater part of the day; which, as has
        been seen, really lasted nearer 25 hours than 24.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But with soft singing and music, or with the recital of slow
        voluptuous poetry, her natural disinclination to sleep was overcome, and
        she began to enjoy the delicious laziness of her existence, and to sleep
        the clock round without turning in her bed. She lived almost entirely
        upon milk, and cream, and cheese soft-curded and mild, with little
        crescent cakes made of rye with white of egg and cane sugar; as for
        meat, venison, as sacred to the huntress Artemis, was her only dish. But
        certain shell-fish were permitted, and all soft and succulent vegetables
        and fruits.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She put on flesh rapidly; the fierce, active, impetuous girl of
        October, with taut muscles and dark-flushed mobile face, had become
        pale, heavy, languid, and indifferent to events, all before the
        beginning of February.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And it was early in this month that she was encouraged by her
        first waking vision of the Moon. Naturally her sleep had already been
        haunted by this idea from the beginning; it could hardly have been
        otherwise with the inveterate persistence of the ceremonies. The three
        women always chanted a sacred sentence, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Epelthon&nbsp;
        Epelthon&nbsp; Artemis</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</a>
        continuously for an hour after her couching; and then one of them went
        on while the others slept. They would each take a shift of three hours.
        The words were rather droned than sung, to an old magical chant, which
        Sister&nbsp; Clara, who was half
        Greek, half [190] Italian, born of a noble family of Mitylene, had
        inherited from some of the women of the island at her initiation as a
        young girl into some of their mysteries. They claimed that it had come
        down unaltered from the great singers of history. It was a drowsy lilt,
        yet in it was a current of fierce heat like that of the sun, and an
        undertone of sobbing like the sea.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So Iliel's dreams were always of the moon. If the watcher beheld
        trouble upon her face, as if disturbing influences were upon her, she
        would breathe softly in her ear, and bring her thoughts back to the
        infinite calm which was desired for her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For Cyril Grey in devising the operation had by no means been
        blind to the dangers involved in choosing a symbol so sensitive as Luna.
        There is all the universe between her good and evil sides; in the case
        of a comparatively simple and straightforward planet like Saturn, this
        is not the case. And the planets with a backbone are far easier to
        control. If you once get Mars going, so to speak, it is easy to make him
        comply with Queensberry rules; but the moon is so passive that the
        slightest new influence throws her entirely out.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And, of course, the calmer the pool the bigger the splash! Hence,
        in order to draw down to Iliel only the holiest and serenest of the
        lunar souls, no precaution could be too great, no assiduity too intense.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The waking vision which came to her after about a month of the
        changed routine was of good cheer and great encouragement.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was an hour after sunset; the night was curiously warm, and a
        soft breeze blew from the sea. It was part of the duty of Iliel to
        remain in the moonlight, with her gaze and her desire fixed upon the
        orb, whenever possible. From her room a stairway led [191] to a tall
        turret, circular, with a glass dome, so as to favour all such
        observations. But on this night the garden tempted her. Nox erat et
        caelo fulgebat Luna sereno inter minora&nbsp;
        sidera. The moon hung above Capri, two hours from her setting.
        Iliel held her vigil upon the terrace, by the side of the basin of the
        fountain. When the moon was not visible, she would always replace her by
        looking upon the sea, or upon still water, for these have much in common
        with the lunar influence.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Something -- she never knew what -- drew her eyes from the moon
        to the water. She was so placed that the reflexion appeared in the
        basin, at the very edge of the marble, where the water flowed over into
        the little rivulets that coursed the terrace. There was a tremulous
        movement, almost like a timid kiss, as the water touched the edge.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And, to the eye of Iliel, it seemed as if the trembling of the
        moon's image were a stirring of vitality.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The thought that followed was a mystery. She said that she looked
        up, as if recalled to her vigil, and found that the moon was no longer
        in the sky. Nor indeed was there any sky; she was in a grotto whose
        walls, fantastically draped with stalactites, glimmered a faint purplish
        blue -- very much the effect, she explained, of luminous paint. She
        looked down again; the basin was gone; at her feet was a young fawn,
        snow-white, with a collar of silver. She was impelled to read the
        engraving upon the collar, and was able to make out these words:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p align="center">Siderum
        regina bicornis audi,
        
        </p>
        <p align="center">Luna,
        puellas.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel had learnt no Latin. But these words were not only Latin,
        but the Latin of Horace; and they were exactly appropriate to the nature
        of the Great [192] Experiment, &quot;Luna&quot; she had heard, and
        &quot;regina&quot;;&nbsp; and she
        might have guessed &quot;puellas&quot; and even &quot;siderum&quot;; but
        that is one thing, and an accurate quotation from the Carmen Saeculare
        is another. Yet they stood in her mind as if she had always known them,
        perhaps even as if they were innate
        in her. She repeated aloud:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Siderum regina bicornis audi,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Luna, puellas.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;List, o moon, o queen of the stars, two-horned,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        List to the maidens!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the time, she had, of course, no idea of the meaning of the
        words.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When she had read the inscription, she stroked the fawn gently;
        and, looking up, perceived that a child, clad in a kirtle, with a bow
        and quiver slung from her shoulders, was standing by her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the vision passed in a flash; she drew her hand across her
        brow, as if to auscultate her mental condition, for she had a slight
        feeling of bewilderment. No, she was awake; for she recognized the
        sacred oak under which she was standing. It was only a few paces from
        the door of the temple where she was priestess. She remembered perfectly
        now: she had come out to bid the herald blow his horn. And at that
        moment its mountainous music greeted her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But what was this? From every tree in the wood, from every blade
        of grass, from under every stone, came running little creatures in
        answer to the summons. They were pale, semi-transparent, with oval (but
        rather flattened) heads quite disproportionately large, thin, match-like
        bodies and limbs, and snake-like tails attached to the base of their
        skulls. They were extraordinarily light and active on their feet, [193]
        and the tails kept up a lashing movement. The whole effect was comic, at
        the first sight; one might have said tadpoles on stilts.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But a closer inspection stayed her laughter. Each of these
        creatures had a single eye, and in this eye was expressed such force and
        energy that it was terrifying. The effect was heightened by the
        sagacity, the occult and profound knowledge of all possible things,
        which dwelt behind those fiery wills. In the carriage of the head was
        something leonine as well as serpentine; there was extraordinary pride
        and courage to match the fierce persistency.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet there seemed no object in the movements of these strange
        beings; their immense activity was unintelligible. It seemed as if they
        were going through physical exercises -- yet it was something more than
        that. At one moment she fancied that she could distinguish leaders, that
        this was a body of troops being rallied to some assault.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then her attention was distracted. From her feet arose a
        swan, and took wing over the forest. It must have been there for a long
        time, for it had laid an egg directly between her sandalled feet. She
        suddenly realized that she was dreadfully hungry. She would go into the
        temple and have the egg for breakfast. But no sooner had she picked it
        up than she saw that it, like the collar of the fawn in her dream, was
        inscribed with a Latin sentence. She read it aloud: the words were
        absolutely familiar. They were those of the labarum of Constantine
        &quot;In hoc signo vinces.&quot; &quot;In this sign thou shalt
        conquer.&quot; But her,eyes gave the lie to her ears; for the word
        &quot;signo&quot; was spelt
        &quot;Cygno&quot;! The phrase was then a pun -- &quot; In this Swan thou
        shalt conquer.&quot; At the time she did not understand; but she was
        sure of the spelling, when she came afterwards to report her vision to
        Sister Clara. [194]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It then came into her mind that this egg was a great treasure,
        and that it was her duty to guard it against all comers;
        and at the same moment she saw that the creatures of the wood --
        &quot;sons of the oak&quot; she called them instinctively -- were
        advancing toward her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She prepared to fight or fly. But, with a fearful crackling, the
        lightning -- which was, in the strange way of dreams, identical with the
        oak -- burst in every direction, enveloping her with its blaze; and the
        crash of the thunder was the fall of the oak. It struck her to the
        ground. The world went out before her eyes, dissolved into a rainbow
        rush of stars; and she heard the shouts of triumph of the &quot;sons of
        the oak&quot; as they dashed forward upon her ravished treasure.
        &quot;Mitos ho Theos!&quot; they shouted -- Sister Clara did not know,
        or would not tell, its meaning.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As the iridiscent galaxy in which she was floating gradually
        faded, she became aware that she was no longer in the wood, but in a
        strange city. It was crowded with men and women, of many a race and
        colour. In front of her was a small house, very poor and squalid, in
        whose doorway an old man was sitting. A long staff was by his side,
        leaning against the door; and at his feet was a lantern -- was it a
        lantern? It was more like the opposite of one; for in the full daylight
        it burned, and shed forth rays of darkness. The ancient was dressed in
        grey rags; his long unkempt hair and beard had lacked a barber for many
        a day. But his right arm was wholly bare, and around it was coiled a
        serpent, gold and green, with a triple crown sparkling with ruby,
        sapphire, and with it he was engraving a great square tablet of emerald.
        [195]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She watched him for some time; when he had finished, he went away
        with the staff, and the lamp, and the tablet, to the sea shore. Along
        the coast he proceeded for some time, and came at last to a cave. Iliel
        followed him to its darkest corner; and there she saw a corpse lying.
        Strangely, it was the body of the old scribe himself. It came to her
        very intensely that he had two bodies, and that he always kept one of
        them buried, for safety. The old scribe left the tablet upon the breast
        of the dead man, and went very quickly out of the cave.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Iliel remained to read what was written.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was afterwards translated by Cyril Grey, and there is no need
        to give the original.

        In this obscure and antique oracle, so Simon Iff himself
        subsequently agreed, the secret of the Universe is revealed to those who
        are worthy to partake of it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel could not understand a word of what was written, but she
        realized that it must be valuable, and, taking the tablet, she hid it in
        her robe and came out of the cave. Then she saw that the coast was
        changed: it was the familiar Posilippo which hung above her, and she
        could see Vesuvius away to the right. She turned to breast the steep
        slope between her and the road, when she found herself confronted by
        something that she could not see. She had only a feeling that it was
        black, that it was icy cold, and that it wished to take the tablet from
        her. Her first sentiment was that of acute hatred and repulsion; but the
        thing, whatever it was, seemed so wretched, that
        she felt she would like to help it. Then she suddenly glowed hot -- the
        arms of Abdul Bey were round her, and his face was looking into hers.
        She dropped the tablet hastily; she was back again in a ball-room
        somewhere, thousands of miles and thousands of years away. And then she
        saw the moon, near her setting, over Capri; she was on the terrace,
        seated on the ground, perfectly awake, but with the silver crescent from
        her hair lying upon the marble before her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sister Clara, on her knees beside her, was trying to decipher the
        scratches that she had made.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That is the writing on the tablet,&quot; said Iliel, as if
        Sister Clara already knew all about it,&nbsp;
        &quot;that the old man hid in the cave.&quot; [197]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was now the hour for her to cradle her limbs in slumber; but,
        while the monotonous chant of her hand-maidens wooed the soft air, Cyril
        Grey and Brother Onofrio were at work upon the inscription.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Almost until dawn they toiled; and, down in another villa,
        another labour reached its climax. Arthwait had finished his Grimoire.
        He was just in time. For the great operation of necromancy should
        properly begin on the second day of the waning of the moon, and there
        were nine previous days of most arduous preparation, no longer of the
        materials, but of the sorcerers themselves.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They must eat dog's flesh, and black bread baked without salt or
        leaven, and they must drink unfermented grape-juice -- the vilest of all
        black magical concoctions, for it implies the denial of the divine
        beatitude, and affirms God to be a thing of wood. There were many other
        precautions also to be taken. The atmosphere of the charnel must be
        created about them; they must abstain from so much as the sight of
        women; their clothing might not be changed even for an hour, and its
        texture was to be that of cerements, for, filching the grave-clothes
        from corpses of the unassoiled, they must wrap themselves closely round
        in them, with some hideous travesty of the words of the Burial Service.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A visit to the Jewish graveyard put them in possession of the
        necessary garments; and Arthwait's palinode upon the &quot;resurrection
        unto damnation&quot; left in each mind due impression of the ghastliness
        of their projected rite.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And, in Paris, Douglas, smashing the neck of a bottle of whisky
        on the edge of the table, was drinking the good health of his visitor,
        an American woman of the name of Cremers.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her squat stubborn figure was clad in rusty-black clothes, a
        man's except for the skirt; it was [198] surmounted by a head of unusual
        size, and still more unusual shape, for the back of the skull was
        entirely flat, and the left frontal lobe much more developed than the
        right; one could have thought that it had been deliberately knocked out
        of shape, since nature, fond, it may be, of freaks, rarely pushes
        asymmetry to such a point.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There would have been more than idle speculation in such a
        theory; for she was the child of hate, and her mother had in vain
        attempted every violence against her before her birth.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The face was wrinkled parchment, yellow and hard; it was framed
        in short, thick hair, dirty white in colour; and her expression denoted
        that the utmost cunning and capacity were at the command of her
        rapacious instincts. But her poverty was no indication that they had
        served her; and those primitive qualities had in fact been swallowed up
        in the results of their disappointment. For in her eye raved bitter a
        hate of all things, born of the selfish envy which regarded the
        happiness of any other person as an outrage and affront upon her. Every
        thought in her mind was a curse -- against God, against man, against
        love, or beauty, against life itself. She was a combination of the
        witch-burner with the witch; an incarnation of the spirit of Puritanism,
        from its sourness to its sexual degeneracy and perversion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas put the broken glass to his mouth, and gulped down a
        bumper of whisky. Then he offered the bottle to his visitor. She refused
        by saying that it &quot;played hell with the astral body,&quot; and
        asked her host to give her the price of the drink instead. Douglas
        laughed like a madman -- a somewhat disgusted madman, for in him was
        some memory of his former state, and even his fall had been
        comparatively decent, the floor of his hell a ceiling to her heaven.
        [199] But he had a use for the hag, and he contemptuously tossed her a
        franc. She crawled over the floor, like some foul insect, in search of
        it, for it had rolled to a corner; and, having retrieved it, she forgot
        her mannish assumptions in her excitement at the touch of silver, and
        thrust it into her stocking. [200]
