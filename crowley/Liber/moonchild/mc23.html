        THE ARRIVAL OF A CHINESE GOD UPON THE FIELD OF BATTLE;
        OF HIS SUCCESS WITH HIS SUPERIORS AND OF A
        SIGHT WHICH HE SAW UPON THE ROAD TO PARIS. ALSO
        OF THAT WHICH THEREBY CAME UNTO HIM, AND OF
        THE END OF ALL THOSE THINGS WHOSE EVENT BEGAT A

        UNMATCHED in history is the Retreat of the British Army from
        Mons. It was caught unprepared; it had to fight three weeks before it
        was ready; it was outnumbered three to one by a triumphant enemy; it was
        not co-ordinated with the French armies, and they failed to support it
        at critical moments; yet it fought that aweful dogged fight from house
        to house, and field to field, through league on league of Northern
        France. The line was forced to lengthen constantly as the retreat
        continued; it was attenuated by that and by its losses to beyond any
        human breaking-point; but luckily for England, her soldiers are made of
        such metal that the thinner the wire is drawn the tougher it becomes.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, there is a point at which &quot;open order&quot; is like
        the word &quot;decolletee&quot; used to describe a smart American
        woman's dinner dress; and General Cripps was feeling it at the moment
        when his new Intelligence Officer presented himself. It was about six
        o'clock at night; Cripps and his staff were bivouacked in the mairie
        of a small village. They were contemplating a further retreat that
        night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Sit down, Captain Grey,&quot; said the chief kindly. [322]
        &quot;Join us at dinner -- just as soon as we can get these orders out
        -- listen and you'll pick up the outlines -- we'll talk after dinner --
        on the road.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril took a chair. To his delight, an aide-de-camp, Lord
        Juventius Mellor, an exquisite young dandy with a languid lisp, who, in
        time of peace, had been pupil and private secretary of Simon Iff, came
        to greet him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ju, dear boy, help me out. I've got to tell Cripps
        something, and he'll think I'm mad. It's bluff, too; but it's true
        for all that -- and it's the one chance in the world.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Right O!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Are we retreating again?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;All through the night. There's not a dog's chance to save
        Paris, and the line stretches every hour.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't worry about Paris -- it's as safe as Bordeaux. Safer,
        because the Covernment is at Bordeaux!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;My poor friend, wouldn't you be better in a home?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The British Army had no illusions about its situation. It was a
        thin, drab line of heroes, very thin and very drab, but there was no
        doubt about the heroism, and no uncertainty about what would happen to
        it if the Germans possessed a leader with initiative. So far the hostile
        legions had moved according to the rules, with all due scientific
        precaution. A leader of temperament and intuition might have rushed that
        tenuous line. Still, science was as sure as it was as slow -- and the
        whole army knew it. They prepared to die as expensively as possible,
        with simplicity of manhood. They had not yet heard that Press and Pulpit
        had made them the laughing-stock of the world by the invention of the
        ridiculous story of the &quot;Angels of Mons.&quot; [323] Lord Juventius
        Mellor was something of a hero-worshipper. From Simon Iff he would have
        taken any statement with absolute respect, and Grey's remark had been
        somewhat of the Simon Iff brand. It was, therefore, almost as much an
        impertinence as it was an absurdity. Paris was as certain to fall as the
        sun to set. It was in rotten bad taste to joke about it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look here!&quot; said Cyril, &quot;I'm serious.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;All the worse!&quot; retorted Mellor. &quot;You really
        would be better in a home.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You wouldn't talk like that if we were discussing
        magick.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;True.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then you are an ass. I am talking magick. If you had only
        ears to hear!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Everything's a magical phenomenon, in the long run. But
        war's magick, from the word jump. Come now therefore and let us reason
        together, saith the Lord. I have done a divination by the Tarot, by a
        method which I cannot explain, for that it pertaineth to a grade so much
        more exalted than yours that you have never even heard the name of it;
        and I know the plans of the German General Staff in detail.&quot;
        Cyril's tone transformed his asinine utterance
        into something so Sybilline, Oracular, Delphic, Cumaean, that his
        interlocutor almost trembled. Verus incessu patuit Deus -- when Cyril
        thought it necessary to impress the uninitiate. To the majority of
        mankind gold looks like dross unless it be wrapped up in tinsel, and
        tenfold the proper price marked on it in plain figures, with the word
        &quot;Sacrifice.&quot; Hence it is that the most successful merchants
        omit the gold altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh; I didn't understand.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You'll observe that I can't explain this to [324] Cripps,;
        I shall have to spin some sort of a yarn.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, yes.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In point of fact the &quot;yarn&quot; was already spun; Cyril had
        not been divining by any means more occult than his innate sagacity; but
        Lord Juventius was one of those people who bow only before the
        assumption of authority supported by mystery and tomfoolery, since their
        reason is undeveloped. Such people make excellent secondary figures in
        any campaign; for their confidence in their leaders impresses the
        outsider, who does not know how mentally abject they are. It is said
        that no man is a hero to his valet. On the contrary, every man is a God
        to his secretary -- if not, he had better get rid of the secretary!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Juventius could not have followed Cyril's very astute
        calculations -- those which he meant to lay before General Cripps; but
        he would have staked his life on the accuracy of a Tarot divination so
        obscure that he was not allowed even to hear its nature, and which in
        fact had not been performed. Indeed, it did not even exist, having been
        invented on the spur of the moment by the unscrupulous magician.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I shall tell him that the military situation is
        inextricably bound up with political and dynastic considerations;
        I
        shall drop a word about Anschauung and Welt-politik; you know!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Juventius giggled adorably.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;By the way,&quot; continued Cyril &quot;have you any
        influence -- personal, I mean -- with the old man?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lord Juventius bent forward with lowered eyelids, and sank his
        voice to a confidential whisper.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The day we crossed,&quot; he murmured.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Great. But I thought -- &quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Prehistoric. It's perfectly Cocker.&quot; [325]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Such conversations lack the merit of intelligibility to the
        outsider; but then the outsider is particularly to be kept from
        understanding. Dialogues of this curious sort determine most important
        events in English society and &quot;haute politique.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then see to it that I get taken seriously.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Surely, Kurille!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Precetur oculis mellitis!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Kurille, Catulle!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When Englishmen return to the use of the dead languages, it is a
        sign of that moral state which is said by the Psalmist to resemble the
        Holy Oil that flowed down upon the head of Aaron, even unto the skirts
        of his garments.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The orderly called the Staff to dinner. Cyril, as the guest of
        the evening, was on the Commander-in-Chief's right hand.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You have been very highly recommended to me,&quot; said the
        old Cavalry leader, when the time came to smoke, &quot;and I look to you
        to distinguish yourself accordingly. You will be under the orders of
        Colonel Mavor, of course; you should report to him at once.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;May I give you some information direct?&quot; asked Cyril.
        &quot;The matter hardly brooks delay, as I see it: you should know it at
        once, and -- to be frank -- I think this my best chance of your ever
        hearing it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A damned funny beginning,&quot; growled the general.
        &quot;Well, get on!&quot; The permission was not very gracious; but an
        irregularity is a serious thing in the British Army. General Cripps made
        bad worse.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Unofficially, mind, absolutely unofficially,&quot; he
        added, before Cyril could begin.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is the English expedient for listening to anything without
        hearing it, or saying anything without meaning it. An official
        conversation cannot [326] be thus sterile; it involves notes, memoranda,
        dockets, recommendations, reports, the appointment of commissions,
        interminable deliberations, more reports, questions in Parliament, the
        introduction of bills, and so on. Nothing is done in the end, exactly as
        in the case of an unofficial conversation; so you can take your choice,
        sir, and be damned to you!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Unofficially, of course, General!&quot; agreed Cyril.
        &quot;My object is merely to disclose the plans of the German General
        Staff.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Thank you, Captain Grey,&quot; replied the great man,
        sarcastically;&quot; this will indeed be a service. To save time,
        begin
        from Von Kluck's occupation of Paris, about four days hence.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Impossible, General! Von Kluck will never capture Paris.
        Why, the man is actually of plebeian origin!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;After dinner -- but only then -- such observations are in
        perfectly good taste. Proceed!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am not joking in the least, General. Von Kluck will not
        be allowed to try to capture Paris.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is at least curious that he is marching straight upon
        the city!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Only to thin out our line, sir. Do you observe that the
        Germans have driven a salient to St. Mihiel?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I have. What of it? &quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The object, sir, I submit, is to cut off Verdun from the
        South.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Why Verdun? Because the Crown Prince is at the head of the
        army which threatens it. Paris will never be taken but by that modern
        Caesar!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Something in that, I admit. The little beast is certainly
        unpopular.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They are bound to make him the national hero, at any
        cost.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And where do we come in?&quot; [327]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;What could be clearer? Their right wing will break through
        somewhere, or roll us up. Verdun will be isolated. Der Kronprinz (God
        bless his noble heart!) will walk through, and goose-step all the way to
        Paris. It is the only chance for the Hohenzollern dynasty.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is military madness.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They think they have enough in hand to risk it. But see,
        sir, for God's sake see the conclusion! If I'm right, Von Kluck is bound
        to swerve East, right across our front -- and we'll smash him!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He couldn't risk such a crazy manoeuvre.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Mark my word, sir, he will.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And what do you suggest that I should do about it?
        Unofficially, Captain Grey, quite unofficially!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Get ready to lam it in, sir -- quite unofficially.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, sir, I congratulate you -- on having talked the most
        amusing nonsense that I've heard since my last talk with General Buller!
        And now perhaps you had better report to Colonel Mavor as Intelligence
        Officer.&quot; The general's tone was contemptuous. &quot;Facts are
        required in this army.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Psychological facts are facts, General.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Nonsense, sir; you are not in a debating society or at a
        scientific tea-party.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That last, sir,&quot; replied Cyril coldly &quot;is my
        unavailing regret.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Lord Juventius Mellor frustrated the effect of this impolitic
        speech. He fixed his languid eyes upon the red face of the veteran, and
        his voice came in a soft caressing whisper.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Pardon me; do let us be unofficial for five minutes
        more!&quot;&nbsp; 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, boy?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I think it's only fair to let General Foch enjoy the joke.
        I hear he has been depressed lately.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He might not take it so easily. The French do [328] not
        care to be played with when their country is at stake.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He can only shoot poor Cyril, mon vieux! Just give him two
        days leave, so that he can run over before reporting to Mavor.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh well, I dare say the Intelligence Department can get on
        without its champion guesser for a day or so. Trot along, Grey; but for
        your own sake I advise you to think up a fact or two.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril saluted, and took his leave. Juventius came to see him into
        the car. &quot;I'll wheedle the old ass,&quot; he whispered to his
        friend, &quot;I'll get him to make such dispositions as he can without
        disturbing the line too much; so that if Foch should see any sense in
        your scheme, by any chance, we shan't be too backward in coming
        forward.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Good for you. So long!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ta.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril drove off. It was a terrible and ominous journey to the
        headquarters of General Foch. The line sagged hideously here and there
        so that long detours were necessary. The roads were encumbered not only
        with every kind of military supply, all in disorder, but with fugitive
        soldiers and civilians, some burdened with their household goods, some
        wounded, a long trail of agony lumbering to the rear. The country was
        already patrolled by herds of masterless and savage dogs, reverted, in a
        month of war, to the type of the coyote and the dingo. But Cyril shouted
        in his joy. His confidence rose as he went; he had thought out one of
        General Cripps's &quot;facts&quot; which he felt sure would carry
        conviction to the mind of the French commander.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arrived at the chateau where the general was quartered, he found
        no trouble in gaining audience. The Frenchman, splendidly built, his
        eyes glittering with restless intelligence, concentrated all his
        faculties [329] instantly on his visitor. &quot;You have come from
        General Cripps?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, my General, but on my own responsibility. I have an
        idea ---&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Foch interrupted him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you are in an English uniform!&quot; he could not help
        saying with brisk Gallic surprise.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Cuchullus non facit monachum,&quot; retorted Cyril Grey.
        &quot;I am half Scotch, half Irish.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then pray give yourself the trouble to continue.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I may premise that I have told my idea to General Cripps.
        It convinced him that I am an imbecile or a joker.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        That was his &quot;fact,&quot; his master-argument. It told
        heavily. The face of Foch grew instantly keen and eager with all
        expectation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Let me hear it!&quot; The General reached for a memorandum.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Grey laughed. In a few words he repeated his theory of the German
        plans.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But it is certain!&quot; cried Foch. &quot;One moment;
        excuse me; I must telephone.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He left the room. In five minutes he was back.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Rest easy, Captain Grey,&quot; he said, &quot;we shall be
        ready to catch Von Kluck as he turns. Now, will you do me the pleasure
        to take this note back to your chief? The British must be ready to
        strike at the same moment. I won't ask you to stay; but -- I beg of you
        to come to dine with me after the victory.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is impossible to give any idea of how the word
        &quot;victoire&quot; sounds in the mouth of a French soldier. It has in
        it the ring of a sword thrust home to the hilt, and the cry of a lover
        as he seizes his mistress, and the exultation of a martyr who in the
        moment of his murder reaches conclusively to God.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril went back to the British Headquarters, and [330] handed in
        General Foch's request, through Colonel Mavor, officially.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The events of the next week are of the very spine of history. The
        cruel blow was definitely parried. More still, that first great victory
        not only saved France for all time, but showed that the men of Bonaparte
        had come into their own moral sublimity again. It proved 1870 to have
        been but a transient weakness like our own year of shame when Van Tromp
        swept our ships from the seas.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        General Cripps summoned Cyril Grey to his quarters.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm afraid,&quot; said the old man, &quot;that nothing can
        be done to recognize your services. That your crazy theory should have
        proved correct is only one more example -- we have many such every day
        -- of the operation of the laws of Chance. The weather forecasters
        themselves cannot guess wrong every time. But even if your act had
        merited reward, we should still have been powerless; for, as you
        remember, our conversation was strictly unofficial.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Unofficially, however, you get your step and the K.C.B.&nbsp;
        Favouritism, sir, rank favouritism! Now go across to General
        Foch, Major -- he wishes to present you to two gentlemen named
        respectively Joffre and Poincar'e. Boot and saddle! No time to
        waste,&quot; he said hastily, to check any expression of gratitude. But
        as the two men gripped hands, their eyes were dim -- they were thinking
        of England.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So off went Cyril on the road to Paris, where his rendezvous was
        fixed.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The victory had changed the aspect of the country in the rear of
        the armies as by stage-craft. There were no more fugitives, no more
        disorder. Still the long trains of wounded clogged the roads, here and
        there, but the infection of glory had spread like sunlight over a sky
        swept clear of storm. The supply [331] trains radiated confidence.
        Always the young man met new guns, new wagons, new horses. At every turn
        of the road were fresh
        regiments, gaily singing on their way to the front. Cyril was enchanted
        at the aspect of the troops. Their elasticity and high spirits were
        overwhelming. Once he came upon a regiment of Turcos being transferred
        to another sector -- every man of them with a trophy of the great
        battle. His intense love for all savage men, true men unspoilt by
        civilization, almost mastered him: he wanted to embrace them. He saw
        life assurgent, the menace of
        the enemy thwarted, and his joy flooded his heart so that his throat
        caught fire, and song leaped to his lips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then chill caught him as he came suddenly upon a dreadful
        sight.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Before him on the road stood a sign-post, the lance of a Spahi,
        thrust into the bank of a ditch; nailed to it was a placard on which was
        coarsely chalked the one word ESPION. A fatal curiosity drew him to the
        spot; as he approached, the wild dogs that were fighting around the
        sinister signal fled in terror from their ghastly meal.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A sword had been thrust through the belly of the corpse; the
        tongue had been torn out. One could recognize at a glance the work of
        Algerian troops -- men who had lost a third of their effectives through
        the treacheries of the German spies. But, despite all mutilation, he
        recognized more than that: he recognized the carcass. This carrion had
        once been Douglas.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey did a strange thing, a thing he had not done for many
        years: he broke into a strong sobbing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I know now,&quot; he murmured, &quot;that Simon Iff is
        right. The Way of the Tao! I must follow that harder path, the Path
        where he who would advance draws back.&quot; [332]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He put spurs to his horse; half-an-hour later he saw the sunset
        glint upon the Eiffel Tower, and on the wings of one of those gallant
        birds that circled about it to keep watch and ward on Paris.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The next morning he reported himself to the British authorities;
        and it was Lord Antony Bowling who presented him to the President and
        Commander-in-Chief.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At the banquet he found himself an Officer of the Legion of
        Honour; but his brilliancy and buoyancy were gone. He dined in dull
        decorum. His thoughts still turned to the shameful corpse in the ditch
        by the wayside. He excused himself early, and left the Elysee. At the
        gate stood an automobile. In it sat Lisa la Giuffria. She jumped out and
        caught him by the shoulders. She poured out the tale of her madness, and
        its result, and its cure, her careful tracking of his movements, her
        determination to recover him at any cost. He listened in silence -- the
        silence of incurable sadness. He shook his head.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Have you no word for me?&quot; she cried impetuously, torn
        by her agony.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Have you no gift for me?&quot; he answered.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She understood. &quot;Oh, you are human! you are human!&quot; she
        cried.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I do not know what I am,&quot; he answered. &quot;Yesterday
        I saw the end of the game -- for one!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He told her in a few words of the horror on the roadside.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Go!&quot; he said, &quot;take that girl, Douglas's last
        victim, for your maid. Go to America; find the Child of the Moon. There
        may, or there may not be, other tasks for us to do; I know not -- time
        will show.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I will, I will,&quot; she cried, &quot;I will go now,
        quickly. Kiss me first!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Once again the tears gathered in the magician's [333] eyes; he
        understood, more deeply than he had ever done, the Sorrow of the
        Universe. He saw how utterly incompatible are all our human ideals with
        the Laws of Life. He took her slowly and gently in his arms; and he
        kissed her. But Lisa did not respond; she understood that this was not
        the man whom she had loved: this was a man that she had never known, one
        whom she dared not love. A man set apart, an idea to adore! She knew
        herself unworthy, and she withdrew herself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I go,&quot; she said, &quot;to seek the Child. Hail and
        farewell!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hail and farewell!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The girl mounted unsteadily into her car. Cyril Grey, his head
        bowed upon his breast, plunged into the wooded pleasaunce of the Champs
        Elysees.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        An ineffable weariness came upon him as he walked. He wondered
        dully if he were going to be ill. He came up against the Obelisk in the
        Place de la Concorde with a shock of surprise. He had not noticed that
        he had left the trees. The Obelisk decided him; its shape smote into his
        soul the meaning of the Mysteries of Egyptian Magick. It was as
        invigorating as a cold plunge. He strode away towards Montmartre.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Profess-House of the Order had been converted into a
        hospital. But who should come to greet him if not Sister Cybele?
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Beside her stood the severe figure of Simon Iff. There were two
        others in the background. Cyril was not surprised to see his old master,
        the Mahathera Phang; but the other? It was Abdul Bey.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Come forward and shake hands,&quot; cried Simon Iff.
        &quot;I have not been inactive, Cyril,&quot; added the old man. &quot;I
        have had my eye on our young friend for a long time. I put my hand on
        him at the right moment. I showed him that spying was a dog's [334]
        game, with a dog's death at the end of it. He has renounced his errors,
        and he is now a Probationer of our Holy Order.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The young men greeted each other, the Turk stammering out an
        appeal for pardon, the other laughing off his embarrassment.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you are ill, Cyril!&quot; cried Sister Cybele. And in
        truth the boy could hardly stand.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Action and reaction are equal and opposite,&quot; explained
        Simon Iff, cheerily. &quot;You will sleep, Brother Cyril, and you will
        then pass seven days in meditation, in one of the high trances. I will
        see to the extension of your leave.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There is a meditation,&quot; said Cyril firmly, &quot;given
        by the Buddha, a meditation upon a corpse torn by wild beasts. I will
        take that.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff acquiesced without comprehending. He did not know that
        Cyril Grey had understood that the corpse of Douglas was his own; that
        the perception of the identity of himself with all other living things
        had come to him, and raised him to a great Adeptship.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But there was one to comprehend the nature of that initiation. As
        Cyril walked, leaning on the arm of Sister
        
        </p>
        <p>Cybele,
        to the room appointed for his prescribed solitude, he beheld a great
        light. It shone serenely from the eyes of the Mahathera Phang.
