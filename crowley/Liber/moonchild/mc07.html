        <p align="center">OF
        THE OATH OF LISA LA GIUFFRIA; AND OF HER<br>
        VIGIL
        IN THE CHAPEL OF ABOMINATIONS</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;BEFORE we go further,&quot; began Cyril Grey, &quot;I think
        it right to express a doubt as to the advisability of our procedure. We
        have already seen the most determined opposition to our plans; and for
        my part, I would say frankly that it might be wiser, certainly safer, to
        abandon them.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa turned on him like a tigress. &quot;I don't know what your
        plans are, and don't care. But I didn't think you'd go back on
        them.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Impulsive ladies,&quot; returned Cyril, &quot;rush in where
        angels fear to tread.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'll go,&quot; said she. &quot;I'm sorry for all that has
        happened -- all!&quot; and she fixed her lover with a look of infinite
        contempt.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril shrugged his shoulders. &quot;If you feel like that, of
        course, we can continue. But when the pinch comes, don't squeal! I have
        warned you.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Brother Cyril could not draw back if he wished,&quot; put
        in Sister Cybele. &quot;He is bound by his oath -- as, in a little
        while, you will be.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa read upon the woman's face a smile, as of triumphant malice.
        It disturbed her far more than Cyril's protest. Was she indeed in a
        trap? It might be so; then, Cyril, who had tried to save her, was in the
        trap too. She must go on, if only to be able to save him when
        opportunity occurred. At present [91] she was wholly in the dark. She
        could feel the atmosphere of constraint, of subtle and terrible forces
        in the abyss which she was treading blindfold upon some razor-edge whose
        supports she could not even imagine; the adventure was to her a supreme
        excitement, and she lived first and last for that. Had she known herself
        better, she would have understood that her love for Cyril was little
        more than a passion for the bizarre. But at the moment she was Joan of
        Arc and Juliet in one.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Moreover, she had the instinctive feeling that wherever these
        people might be going it was certainly somewhere. They were engineers
        building a bridge to an unknown land, just as methodically and
        purposefully as the builders of an earthly bridge. There was no doubt as
        to the validity of their knowledge or their powers. She perceived that
        Lord Antony Bowling had spent his life in the investigation of
        disjointed, purposeless items of mostly
        plain fraud; while under his very nose the Brethren of this Order were
        proceeding calmly with some stupendous task, not troubling even to
        acquaint the world with their results. And she could dimly guess why
        this was so, and must be so. They did not wish to be dragged into
        foolish controversies with the ignorant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And just then Simon Iff took up the conversation with a remark in
        tune with that thought.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We shall not ask you for any pledge of secrecy, he said,
        &quot;for you have only to say what you see and hear to be laughed at
        for a liar. If this be our last meeting, we are quits. You will be taken
        to a little chapel leading from this room. There you will find a circle,
        which you must enter, being careful not to touch it, even with your
        dress; for that would be dangerous. Within that circle you must remain
        until we send for you, unless you wish to leave, in [92] which case you
        have only to pass through the white curtains in the north. You will find
        yourself in a lighted passage; open the dooor at the end, you will be in
        the street, where my automobile awaits your orders. Your use of this
        exit will, however, close your career in magick; in any future relations
        we should merely be good friends -- or I hope so -- but we should not
        consider any proposal to reconstruct the present situation.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I will wait until you send for me,&quot; cried Lisa.
        &quot;I swear it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff placed his hand upon her brow; in another instant he
        was gone from the room.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sister Cybele rose and took her by the hand. &quot;Come!&quot;
        said she; &quot;but you had better bid farewell to your lover.&quot; The
        girl once again thrilled to the undertone of malice in the voice. But
        Cyril took her fondly in his arms, and crushed her to him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said, &quot;brave heart, true heart!
        To-morrow we shall be alone together!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Trembling, la Giuffria returned to Sister Cybele, and followed
        her to the door of the chapel. She threw a last look over her shoulder:
        to her amazement Cyril was regarding her with a cynical smile of
        amusement. Her heart went deadly cold; she felt the pull of Sister
        Cybele's hand, suddenly grown iron and inexorable. The door shut behind
        her with a monstrous clang; and she found herself in a room at once
        obscure and menacing.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She wondered why they called it a chapel. It was a bell-shaped
        cave. She dimly saw the white curtains of which Iff had spoken; there
        was nothing else in the room but a square thin altar whose surface was
        of polished silver, around whose base ran a broad copper band, evidently
        the circle referred to, and ten lamps, set in little stars of iron,
        which gave a faint blue light. The entire chamber was cut out of the
        solid rock. [93] Only that part of it which lay within the circle had
        been dressed; the rest of the floor, and the walls, which bent over to
        meet in a point, were rough.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She stepped carefully into the circle, raising her dress. Sister
        Cybele faced her squarely. In the woman's face Lisa read a thousand evil
        purposes, a cruelty devilishly hot as Cyril's was devilishly cold, and
        the assurance in those grey eyes that she had fallen into the power of
        creatures utterly abominable. Sister Cybele suddenly broke into a short
        harsh laugh, then stepped aside, and Lisa, turning quickly, only saw the
        door close behind her. Heedless of caution, she leapt after her in the
        impulse of self-preservation -- but the door was entirely smooth on the
        inside. She beat against it, uttering a horrible, fierce cry: but only
        silence answered her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The impulse passed as quickly as it had come. Mechanically she
        stepped back into the circle. And as she did so the thought of Simon Iff
        came to calm her. The other two might puzzle her,&nbsp;
        but she felt that Iff would neither do nor suffer wrong.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During dinner, too, she had fixed her gaze, fascinated, upon the
        Mahathera Phang. She knew that he was more than friendly to the Order,
        though not a member of it; and his face, coupled with the fact that he
        had not spoken even once in her presence, redoubled that confidence.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In front of the little altar, she discovered, as her eyes
        accommodated themselves to the dimness, a curiously-shapen stool covered
        with leather. She squatted on it, and found it a very Paradise of ease.
        And then it dawned upon her that she had to wait. To wait!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There was no sound or movement to fix her attention; presently
        she began to amuse herself by making faces at herself in the polished
        silver of the [94] altar. It was not long before she tired of that; and
        once again she found herself waiting.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her imagination soon began to people the little room with
        phantoms; the memory of the Thing in the Garden began to obsess her.
        Once again Simon Iff came to the rescue. She knew that her imagination
        was at work, and that, even had the shapes about her been real, they
        could not harm her. She heard herself repeating the old mystic's words:
        &quot;Because there is in him no place of death.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She became perfectly calm; for a little while her thoughts
        occupied her. Suddenly they fled, and she found herself (so to speak) in
        a small open boat, without provisions, in the midst of a limitless ocean
        of unutterable boredom.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She had a period of fidgets; that over, she became listless, and
        merely prayed for sleep.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then she noticed that a square pencil of light had entered from
        the apex of the chapel, and was casting glory upon the top of the altar.
        She rose instantly -- and gasped in amazement, for figures were moving
        on the silver.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Three men, with strange musical instruments, species respectively
        of flute, viol, and drum, were walking across a room. This room was hung
        with rose-coloured curtains, and lit with silver candelabra. At one end
        was a dais, and on this the men took their seats. They began to tune
        their instruments, and so strong was her fancy, that she thought she
        heard them. It was a fantastic Oriental dance-music. Presently a small
        boy, a negro, dressed in a yellow tunic and baggy breeches of pale blue,
        entered the room. He carried a salver, on which were a great flask of
        wine and two goblets of gold.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then, to her utter amazement, Cyril Grey stepped into the room
        with Sister Cybele. They took the wine from the boy, and, each placing
        the left hand on the [95] left shoulder of the other, they touched their
        goblets, and, throwing their heads back, drained them. The boy took the
        empty cups and disappeared.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She saw Cyril and Cybele draw together; they gave a laugh which
        (once again) she fancied she could hear. It rang demoniac in her very
        inmost soul. An instant more, and their mouths met in a kiss.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa felt her knees give way. She caught the altar, and saved
        herself from falling; but she must have lost consciousness for a second
        or two, for when her eyes opened she saw that they had discarded their
        robes, and were dancing together. It was wild and horrible beyond all
        imagination; the dancers were locked so closely that they appeared like
        a single monster of fable, a thing with two heads and four legs which
        writhed or leapt in hideous ecstasy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was so shaken that she did not even ask herself the nature of
        the vision, whether it was a dream, an hallucination, a picture of the
        past, or an actual happening. The bacchanal obscenity of it was
        overwhelming. Again and again she turned her eyes away; but they always
        returned to the gaze, and every gesture shot a pang of agony to her
        soul. She understood the ambiguities of her lover; his strange behaviour
        seemed like an open book to her; and the malice of Sister Cybele, her
        elfin laughter, her satanic sneer, sank into her bleeding heart like
        acid, burning, fuming.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The revel did not diminish; instead, it took novel and more&nbsp;
        atrocious forms. All that she had ever conceived of sensuality of
        bestiality, was a thousandfold surpassed. It was an infinite refinement
        of abomination joined with an exaggeration of grossness that might have
        turned Georges Sand to stone. The light went out.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The thought of flight from that abominable chapel never came to
        her. It was Cyril -- the man to whom [96] she had given herself utterly
        at the first touch -- who was plunging this poisoned dagger into her
        soul. And she could not even die; it was ferocity and madness that awoke
        in her. She would wait until the morning -- and she would find a way to
        be avenged. Yet she felt that she was slowly bleeding to death; it did
        not seem that any morning
        could ever come to her. She would not be able to face Cyril; it seemed
        somehow as if the shame were hers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then she screamed aloud -- a soft hand was on her shoulder.
        &quot;Hush! Hush!&quot; came a gentle voice in her ear. It was the girl
        who had waited on her at dinner. Even at the time Lisa had noticed that
        she was very different to the others; for they were of most cheerful
        countenance, and this girl's eyes were red with weeping. &quot;Come
        away!&quot; said the girl, &quot;come away while it is time. This is the
        first chance I have ever had to escape; I was set to watch the chapel
        door to-night; and I found the spring. Oh, come away quickly! They're
        criminals; they corrupt you and they torture you. Oh do come, sister! I
        can't escape without you; the man in the automobile would stop me. But
        if you come, I can slip away. It's only a step through the passage. Oh
        God! Oh God! if I had only gone when I was as you are!&quot; Lisa's
        whole soul went out in sympathy to the gentle creature.&quot; Look what
        they've done to
        me!&quot; &quot;Feel all down my back!&quot; The girl winced with pain
        even at Lisa's gentle finger-tips. Her back was a mass of knotted weals;
        she must have been beaten savagely with a sjambok or a knout.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And see my arms!&quot; The girl lifted her hands, and the
        loose sleeves of her robe fell back. From wrist to elbow she was a mass
        of parallel cuts. &quot;I wouldn't do what they wanted,&quot; she
        moaned, &quot;it was too horrible. You'd think no woman would; [97] but
        they do. Sister Cybele's the worst. O come! do come from this abominable
        house!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa had touched the summit of the mountain of hysteria. Her
        feelings were far beyond all expression; she was living in a world
        deeper than feeling. She gained the consciousness of her own nature,
        something far deeper than anything she had ever known, and she expressed
        its will in words of absolute despair. &quot;I can't leave Cyril
        Grey.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm afraid of him more than all the others,&quot; whispered
        the girl.&quot; I loved him too. And when I came to him two days ago,
        thinking that he still loved me -- he laughed -- and he had me whipped.
        Oh come away!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I can't,&quot; said Lisa, brokenly. &quot;But you shall go.
        Here, take my dress; give me your robe. The chauffeur won't know the
        difference. Tell him to drive to the Grand Hotel; ask for Lavinia King;
        I'll get word to you to-morrow, and money if you need it. But - I -
        can't - go.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The last words dripped out icily from the frozen waters of her
        soul. Quickly the girl dressed herself in Lisa's clothes: then she threw
        the white robe over her -- La Giuffria never thought of the symbolism of
        the action; she would have rather stood naked before a thousand men than
        appear in that garment of infamy ---
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The girl pressed one soft kiss upon her forehead: then was gone
        headlong through the curtains. Lisa heard the clang of the outer door,
        and a breath of cold air swept round the room.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It dizzied her, as if she had been drunk; she remembered no more;
        probably she slept.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At last, she came to consciousness again in a most strange state
        of being. A peculiar smell was in the air, something as of the sea; she
        felt a physical exhilaration incomparable. Her mind was still quite [98]
        blank as to the past; she was not even surprised at her surroundings.
        She rose and began to stretch her arms in a dozen physical exercises.
        Just as she touched her toes for the tenth time the door behind her
        opened. Sister Cybele was standing
        there. &quot;Come, Sister!&quot; she cried, &quot;it will be dawn in
        three minutes; first we must make the Adoration of the Sun, and then
        comes breakfast!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The horror of the night returned to Lisa in a flash. But somehow
        it had receeded into a deeper stratum of her being; when it came to a
        question of any possible action, she seemed remote. She had the horrible
        fancy that she had died in the night. She followed Sister Cybele as she
        would have followed her executioner to the block.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together they went up a spiral staircase. They
        came to a large room, circular in shape; it was full of the members of
        the Order, in their robes. At the East, where an oriel opened toward the
        dawn, she could see the figure of Simon Iff, his eyes fixed, awaiting
        the rising of the Sun.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A beam touched his face; and he began:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hail unto thee that art Ra in thy rising; even unto thee
        that art Ra in thy strength, that travellest over the Heavens in thy
        Bark in the uprising of the Sun! Tahuti standeth in his splendour at the
        prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm; hail unto thee from the abodes of
        night!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It seemed to her that the whole assembly, uniting in the singular
        gesture with which Simon Iff accompanied his words, was uplifted in some
        subtle way beyond her understanding. The crowd-psychology assailed her;
        and she gritted her teeth to curse this hypocrisy of devilry.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But at that moment the crowd broke like a wave upon the beach;
        and she saw a girl running upon her. [99]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, you were splendid, sister!&quot; cried a voice, and two
        scarred arms were thrown about her neck. It was the girl of the night
        before!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Didn't you escape?&quot; babbled Lisa, incoherent.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the child's ringing laughter silenced her. &quot;I forgive
        you for spoiling my record,&quot; she bubbled over. &quot;You know, I'm
        supposed to get them five times in six.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa stood bewildered. But Sister Cybele was wringing her hands
        and kissing her, and Cyril Grey was telling the child that he had first
        claim on the strangle-hold ---
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then they all suddenly melted from her. Simon Iff was walking
        toward her, and his hand was open.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I congratulate you, sister,&quot; he said solemnly,
        &quot;upon your initiation to our holy Order. You have well earned the
        robe in which you stand, for you have paid its price -- service to
        others without thought of the consequence to yourself. Let us break our
        fast!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And he took Lisa's arm; presently they came to the refectory. As
        in a well-rehearsed play, every one fell into his place; and before Lisa
        realized the utter subversion that had taken place in her being, Sister
        Cybele was on her feet, proclaiming:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa thought that breakfast the most delicious she had ever
        tasted in her life.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A great reaction from the strain of the previous twenty-four
        hours was upon her. She had lived a lifetime in that period; and in a
        sense she had most surely died and been reborn. She felt like a little
        child. She wanted to climb on to everybody's knee, and be hugged! She
        had regained at a single [100] stroke the infant's faith in human
        nature; she looked at the universe as simply as a great artist does.
        (For in him too lives and rejoices the Eternal Babe).
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But her greatest surprise was in her physical health and energy.
        She had passed through a fierce and furious day, a night of infernal
        torture; yet she was unaccountably buoyant, eager, assiduous in every
        act, from her smiled word of pleasure to the drinking of her coffee.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Everything at that meal seemed matter of intoxication. She had
        not previously realized that toast, properly understood, was a superior
        stimulant to brandy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When breakfast ended, she could not have walked across the room.
        It was dancing or nothing, so she said to herself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Somehow she found herself once more in the Chapel of
        Abominations. On the altar was laid a sprig of gorse, and the sunlight,
        streaming through the apex of the vault, made its thorny bloom of the
        very fire and colour of day.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff stood behind the altar; Cyril Grey was on her right
        hand, Sister Cybele on her left. They joined their hands about her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I will now complete the formality of your reception,&quot;
        said the old man. &quot;Say after me: 'I (your name).'&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I, Lisa la Giuffria ---&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Solemnly promise to devote myself&quot; She repeated the
        phrase.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To the discovery of my true purpose in this life.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She echoed in a lower tone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All three concluded &quot;So mote it be.&quot; &quot;I receive
        you into this Order,&quot; which Simon Iff, &quot;I confirm you in the
        robe which you have won; I greet you with [101] the right hand of
        fellowship; and I induct you to the Gate of the Great Work.&quot; Still
        holding the hand which he had grasped, he led her from the chapel.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They passed through the refectory, and entered a room on its
        other side. This room was furnished as a library; there was nothing in
        it to suggest magick.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This is the Hall of Learning,&quot; said Simon Iff
        &quot;Here must your work begin. And, innocent as it seems, it is a
        thousandfold more dangerous than the chapel from which you have come
        forth with so much credit.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa seated herself, and prepared to listen to the exposition of
        her task in life which she expected to follow.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But she could not know why the old mystic was at so great pains
        (as he afterwards proved) to make every syllable of his discourse
        intelligible; for she had not heard his conference with Cyril Grey at
        the moment when Sister Cybele had called her. 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Brother Cyril!&quot; the old mystic had said, &quot;I shall
        go on -- I shall even put more than the necessary care into the work --
        as if this were victory and not defeat.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I tell you that you will never do anything yourself, still
        less anything for others, so long as you rely on women. This victory of
        the woman's is only the chance resultant of a chaos of emotional states.
        She's in it for the fun of the thing; she's not even an artist; she's
        merely the female of the species; and I do not alleviate the situation
        by one further precision -- your species!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Are women no use? Why were they made?&quot; asked Cyril,
        angry He did not know that his question was prompted by a desire yet
        unconquered in [102] himself. But Simon Iff answered him with mock
        humility.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am unskilled to unravel the mysteries of the Universe.
        Like Sir Isaac Newton, I am ---&quot; But seeing the muffled rage in the
        boy's eyes, he spared him the conclusion. [103]
