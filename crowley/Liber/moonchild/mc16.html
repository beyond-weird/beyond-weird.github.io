        <p align="center">OF
        THE SPREADING OF THE BUTTERFLY-NET; WITH A DELECTABLE
        DISCOURSE CONCERNING DIVERS ORDERS OF
        BEING; AND OF THE STATE OF THE LADY ILIEL, AND
        HER DESIRES, AND OF THE SECOND VISION THAT SHE
        HAD IN WAKING.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A GREAT peace brooded on the Villa. Daily sun gathered the
        strength; and the west wind told the flowers that a little bird had
        whispered to him that the spring was coming.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The results of the magical invocations began to peep through the
        veil of matter, like early crocuses. The atmosphere of house and garden
        was languid and romantic, so that a stranger could not have failed to
        feel it; yet with this was a timid yet vigorous purity, a concentration
        of the longing of the magicians.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The physical signs were equally unmistakable. By night a faint
        blue luminosity radiated from the whole enclosure, visible to the
        natural eye; and to one seated in the garden, darting scintillations,
        star-sparkles, would appear, flitting from flower to flower, or tree to
        stone, if he kept as still and sensitive as one should in such a garden.
        And on the rightly tuned and tempered ear might fall, now and again,
        vague snatches of some far-off music. Then there were pallid perfumes in
        the air, like suggestions of things cool, and voluptuous, and chaste and
        delicate, and lazy, of those soft tropical loves which satisfy
        themselves with dreams. [215] 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All these phenomena were of a peculiar quality. It will be well
        to recite the fact, and to suggest an explanation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        These sights and sounds are conveyed clearly enough; but they
        disappear the moment the full attention is turned upon them. They will
        not bear inspection; and the fact has been used by shallow thinkers as
        an argument against their reality. It is a foolish point to take, as
        will now be proved.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The range of our senses is extremely limited. Our sensorial
        apparatus only works properly with reference to a very few of very many
        things. Every child knows how narrow is the spectrum, how confined the
        range of musical tone. He has not yet been drilled properly to an
        understanding of what this may mean, and he has not been told with equal
        emphasis many similar facts relating to other forms of perception. In
        particular, he has not learnt the meaning of diluted impression, in
        spite of an admirable story called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The New Accelerator</i> by Mr. H. G. Wells.
        
        </p>
        <p>Our
        vision of things depends upon their speed; for instance, a four-bladed
        electric fan in motion appears as a diaphanous and shining film. Again,
        one may see the wheels of automobiles moving backwards in a
        cinematograph; and, at certain distances, the report of a cannon may be
        heard before the order to fire is given.
        Physics is packed with such paradoxes. Now we know of living beings
        whose time-world is quite different to ours, only touching it over a
        short common section. Thus, a fly lives in a world which moves so fast
        that he cannot perceive motion in anything with a speed of less than
        about a yard a second, so that a man may put his hand upon it if he can
        restrain the impulse to slap. To this fly, then, the whirling fan would
        look quite different; he would be able to distinguish the four blades.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We have thus direct evidence that there are [216]
        &quot;real&quot; &quot;material&quot; beings whose senses are on a
        different range to ours.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We also have reason to believe that this total range is almost
        inconceivably great. It is not merely a question of the worlds of the
        microscope and the telescope; these are mere extensions of our gamut.
        But we now think that a molecule of matter is a universe in most rapid
        whirl, a cosmos comparable to that of the heavens, its electrons as
        widely separated from each other, in proportion to their size, as the
        stars in space. Our universe, then, in its unmeasured vastness, is
        precisely similar in constitution to one molecule of hydrogen; and we
        may suppose that it is itself only a molecule of some larger body; also
        that what we call an electron may itself be a universe -- and so on for
        ever. This suggestion is supported by the singular fact, that the
        proportion in size of electron to molecule is about the same as that of
        sun to cosmos, the ratio in each case being as 1 to
        10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suppose a drop of water, 1/8 inch in diameter, to be magnified to
        the size of the earth, there would be about 30 molecules in every cubic
        foot of it, each molecule being about the size of a golf-ball, or a
        little more.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, the point involved is a simpler one, so far as our
        argument is concerned; it is this -- that there is no question of
        &quot;illusion&quot; about any of these things. Electrons are quite as
        elusive as ghosts; we are only aware of them as the conclusion to a
        colossal sorites. The evidence for ghosts is as strong as that for any
        other phenomenon in nature; and the only argument, for a horse-laugh is
        not argument, which has been adduced against their existence is that you
        cannot catch them. But, just as one can catch the fly by accommodating
        oneself to the conditions of its world, one might (conceivably) catch
        the ghost by conforming with its conditions. [217]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is one magical hypothesis that all things are made up of ten
        different sorts of vibrations, each with a different gamut, and each
        corresponding to a &quot;planet.&quot; Our own senses being built up
        similarly, they only register these when they are combined. Hence, a
        &quot;lunar&quot; being, purified of other elements, would be
        imperceptible. And if one, by emphasizing the lunar quality in oneself,
        began to acquire the power of perceiving similar beings, one would begin
        by perceiving them as tenuous and elusive; just, in fact, as is observed
        to be the case.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        We are therefore justified in regarding the phenomena of the
        magicians as in all respects &quot;real,&quot; in the same sense as our
        own bodies; and all doubt on the subject is removed by consideration of
        the fact, to which all magicians testify, that these phenomena can be
        produced at will, by using proper means.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is no criticism to reply that it should be possible to show
        them &quot;in the laboratory,&quot; because laboratory conditions happen
        not to suit their production. One does not doubt the reality of
        electrical phenomena either, because electricity is not perceptible
        directly by any of the senses, or because its ultimate nature is
        unknown, or because the electrician refuses to comply with your
        &quot;test conditions&quot; by his irrational and evidently felonious
        habit of insulating his wires.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So far as Iliel was concerned, the result of the operation was
        almost too evident. Simon Iff might have thought that things were being
        overdone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For she had become extremely fat; her skin was of a white and
        heavy pallor; her eyes were almost closed by their perpetual droop. Her
        habit of life had become infinitely sensuous and languid; when she rose
        from recumbency she lolled rather than walked; her lassitude was such
        that she hardly cared to feed herself; yet she managed to consume five
        or [218] six times a normal dietary. She seemed always half asleep. A
        cradle, shaped like
        a canoe had been arranged for her on the Terrace of the Moon; and most
        of her waking hours were spent there, drinking milk, and munching creams
        flavoured with angelica. Her soul seemed utterly attracted to the moon.
        She held out her body to it like an offering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Just before the new moon of February, Abdul Bey, before leaving
        Naples, determined to seek a last sight of his adored Lisa. He had found
        her easily, and was amazed at the physical changes in her. They
        increased his passion beyond all measure, for she was now the very ideal
        of any Turkish lover. She appeared hardly conscious of his presence upon
        the wall beyond the little lane that wound below the Terrace of the
        Moon, but in reality she absorbed
        his devotion with a lazy hunger, like a sponge. For her activity and
        resistance had been reduced to zero; she reflected any impression,
        feeling it to the utmost, but incapable of response He understood that
        she could not have repulsed him, yet could have taken no step towards
        him; and he cursed the vigilance of the patrol. Help he must have; and
        though it was agony to drag himself from Naples, he knew that without
        Douglas he could do nothing more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        From the new moon of February, the invocations of Artemis had
        become continuous. Brother Onofrio and his two henchmen devoted their
        time and energy to the rituals which banish all other ideas than the one
        desired; but the boys had joined Sister Clara and her maidens in an
        elaborate ceremony in which the four represented the four phases of the
        moon. This ceremony was performed thrice daily; but the intervals were
        fully occupied. During the whole of the twenty-five hours one or the
        other of the enchanters kept up their conjurations by spells, by music,
        and by dances. Every day witnessed some new [219] phenomenon, ever more
        vivid and persistent, as the imminence of the lunar world increased, and
        as the natures of the celebrants became more and more capable of
        appreciating those silvern vibrations.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey alone took no active part. He represented the solar
        force, the final energy creatrix of all subordinate orbs; his work had
        been done when he had set the system in motion. But since Brother
        Onofrio represented so active a force as Mars, he made himself a silent
        partner to the Italian, an elasticity to buffer the reactions of his
        vehemence. Thus he became a shadow to the warrior, giving him the
        graceful ease which was the due reward of fatigues so exhausting as were
        involved in the Keeping of the Circle. For the labour of banishing
        became daily more arduous; the preponderance of lunar force within the
        circle created a high potential. All the other forces of Nature wished
        to enter and redress the balance. It is the same effect as would be seen
        were one to plunge a globe full of water beneath the sea, and gradually
        withdraw the water from the globe. The strain upon the surface of the
        globe would constantly increase. It may be remarked in parenthesis that
        the Laws of Magick are always exactly like those of the other natural
        forces. All that Magick lacks to put it on a footing with hydrostatics
        or electricity is a method of quantitative estimation. The qualitative
        work is admirably accomplished.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The moon was waxen beyond her first phase; she set well after
        midnight. The nights were yet cold; but Iliel's cradle had been made
        like a nest in cloudland with fleece of camels -- for they are sacred to
        the moon; and she was covered with a quilt of silver fox. Thus she could
        lie in the open without discomfort, and yearn toward her goddess as she
        moved majestically across heaven.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now that the climax of the Experiment was upon [220] her, the
        exaltation of wonder seized her wholly; she was in precisely the state
        necessary to the magical plan. She remained in a continuous reverie of
        longing and expectancy for the marvel which was to come to her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was now the night of the full moon. She rose over the crest of
        Posilippo soon after sunset, and Iliel greeted her from her cradle on
        the Terrace with a hushed song of adoration.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was more languid than ever before, that night. It seemed to
        her as if her body were altogether too heavy for her; she had the
        feeling so well known to opium-smokers, which they call &quot;clou'e 'a
        terre.&quot; It is as if the body clung desperately to the earth, by its
        own weight, and yet in the same way as a tired child nestles to its
        mother's breast. In this sensation there is a perfect lassitude mingled
        with a perfect longing. It may be that it is the counterpart of the
        freedom of the soul of which it is the herald and companion. In the
        Burial Service of the Church,
        we read &quot;earth to earth, dust to dust,&quot; coupled with the idea
        of the return of the spirit to the God that gave it. And there is in
        this state some sister-similarity to death, one would not say sleep, for
        the soul of the sleeper is usually earth-bound by his gross desires, or
        the memory of them, or of his recent impressions. But the smoker of
        opium, and the saint, self-conscious of their nature celestial, heed
        earth no more, and on the pinions of imagination or of faith seek
        mountain-tops of being.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was in this state or one akin to it that Iliel found herself.
        And gradually, as comes also to the smoker of opium, the process of
        bodily repose became complete; the earth was one with earth, and no
        longer troubled or trammelled her truer self.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She became acutely conscious that she was not the body that lay
        supine in the cradle, with the moon [221] gleaming upon its bloodless
        countenance. No; she was rather the blue mist of the whole circle of
        enchantment, and her thoughts the sparkling dew- spirits that darted
        hither and thither like silvery fire-flies. And, as if they were parts
        of herself, she saw Sister Clara and her pages and her hand-maidens
        under the image of stars. For each
        was a radiant world of glory, thrilling with most divine activities, yet
        all in azure orbits curling celestially, their wake of light like
        comets' tails, wrapping her in a motion that was music.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A flaming boundary to her sphere, the fires of the circle blazed
        far into the night, forked swords of scarlet light in everlasting
        motion, snakes of visible force extended every way to keep the gates of
        her garden. She saw the forms of Brother Onofrio and his captains, of
        the same shape as those of Sister Clara and her companions, but blazing
        with a fierce and indomitable heat, throwing off coruscations into the
        surrounding blackness. She was reminded of a visit that yonder idle
        carcass in the cradle had once made to an observatory, where she had
        been shown the corona of the sun.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then, instinctively, she looked for Cyril Grey. But all that
        she could find of him was the green-veiled glory that surrounded the
        sphere of Brother Onofrio; and she understood that this was a mere
        projection of part of his personality. Himself she could not find. He
        should have been the core of all, the axis on which all swung; but she
        could feel nothing. Her intuition told her, in a voice of cogency beyond
        contradiction, that he was not there.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She began to argue with herself, to affirm that she held a part
        of him by right of gift; but, looking on it, she beheld only an
        impenetrable veil. She knew and understood that not yet was the
        Butterfly in the Net, and in that she acquiesced; but the absence of her
        [222] lover himself from her, at this moment of all moments, was mystery
        of horror so chill that she doubted for a time of her own being. She
        thought of the moon as a dead soul -- and wondered -- and wondered ---
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She would have striven to seek him out, to course the universe in
        his pursuit; but she was incapable of any effort. She sank again into
        the receptive phase, in which impressions came to her, like bees to a
        flower, without eliciting conscious response.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And it was then that her bodily eyes opened. The action drew her
        back into her body; but the material universe held her only for a
        second. She saw the moon, indeed, but in its centre was a shape of
        minute size, but infinite brightness. With the speed of a huntress the
        shape neared her, hid the moon from her, and she perceived the buskined
        Artemis, silver-sandalled, with her bright bow and her quiver of light.
        Leaping behind her came her hounds, and she thought that she could hear
        their eager baying.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Between heaven and earth stood the goddess, and looked about her,
        her eyes a-sparkle with keen joy. She unslung her baldric, and put her
        silver bugle to her lips.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Through all the vastness of heaven that call rang loud; and, in
        obedience, the stars rushed from their thrones, and made obeisance to
        their mistress. It was a gallant hunting-party. For she perceived that
        these were no longer stars, but souls. Had not Simon Iff once said to
        her: &quot;Every man and every woman is a star&quot;? And even as she
        understood that, she saw that Artemis regarded them with reverence, with
        awe even. This was no pleasure chase; he who won the victory was himself
        the quarry. Every soul was stamped with absolute heroism; it offered
        itself to itself, like Odin, when nine windy nights he hung in space,
        his own spear thrust into his side. What [223] gain might be she could
        not understand;&nbsp; but it was
        clear enough that every act of incarnation is a crucifixion. She saw
        that she had been mistaken in thinking of these souls as hunters at all;
        and at that instant it seemed to her as though she herself were the
        huntress. For a flash she saw the fabled loadstone rock which draws
        ships to it, and, flashing forth their bolts by the might of its
        magnetism, loosens their timbers so that they are but waifs of flotsam.
        It was only a glimpse; for now the souls drew near her. She could
        distinguish their differences by the colour of the predominating rays.
        And as they approached, she saw that only those whose nature was lunar
        might pass into the garden. The others started back, and it seemed to
        her that they trembled with surprise, as if it were a new thing to them
        to be repelled.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And now she was standing on the Terrace of the Moon with Artemis,
        watching the body of Lisa la Giuffria, that lay there in its cradle. And
        she saw that the body was a dead thing, as dead as the cradle itself; it
        was unreal; all &quot;material&quot; things were unreal, shells void of
        meaning, geometrical abstractions, as Simon Iff had explained to her on
        their first meeting. But this body was different to the other husks in
        one respect, that it was the focus of a most startling electrical
        phenomenon. (She could not think of it but as electrical.) An
        incandescent cone was scintillating before her. She could see but the
        tip of it, but she knew intuitively that the base of it was in the sun
        itself. About this cone played curious figures, dancers wreathed with
        vine leaves, having all sorts of images in their hands, like toys,
        houses, and dolls, and ships and fields, and woods, little soldiers in
        their uniforms, little lawyers in their wigs and gowns, an innumerable
        multitude of replicas of every-day things. And Iliel watched the souls
        as they came into the [224] glow of the cone. They took human shape, and
        she was amazed to see among them
        the faces of many of the great men of the race.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There was one very curious feature about the space in which this
        vision took place: this, that innumerable beings could occupy it at
        once, yet each one remain distinct from all the rest as the attention
        happened to focus it. But it was no question of dissolving views; for
        each soul was present equally all the time.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With most of the faces there was little attachment, scarce more
        than a vague wreath of a mist that swirled purposelessly about them.
        Some, however, were more developed; and it seemed as if more or less
        definite shapes had been formulated by them as adjuncts to their
        original personalities. When it came to such men as Iliel remembered
        through history, there was already a symbolic or pictorial
        representation of the nature of the man, and of the trend of his life,
        about him. She could see the unhappy Maximilian, once Emperor of Mexico,
        a frail thing struggling in an environment far too intense for him. He
        was stifled in his own web, and seemed afraid either to stay where he
        was, or to attempt to approach the cone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Less hampered, but almost equally the prey of hideous
        vacillation, lack of decision, was General Boulanger, whose white horse
        charged again an again through space toward the cone, only to be caught
        up each time by the quick nervous snatch at his rein.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Next him, a gracious girlish figure<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</a>
        was the centre of sparkling waves of music, many-hued; but one could see
        that they were not issuing from her, but only through her. A man of
        short stature<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</a>,
        with a pale face, stood before her, very similar in the character of his
        radiations; but they were colder, and duller, and less clear and
        energetic. [225]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And now all gave way to a most enigmatic figure<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</a>.
        It was an insignificant face and form; but the attributions of him
        filled all heaven. In his sphere was primarily a mist which Iliel
        instinctively recognized as malarious; and she got an impression, rather
        than a vision, of an immense muddy river rushing through swamps. And
        then she saw that from this man's brain issued phantoms like pigeons.
        They were neither Red Indians nor Israelites, yet they had something of
        each in their bearing. And these poured like smoke from the head of this
        little man. In his hand was a book, and he held it over his head. And
        the book itself was guarded by an angelic figure whose face was
        extraordinarily stern and unbeautiful, but who scattered with wide hands
        the wealth of life, children, and corn, and gold. And behind all these
        things was a great multitude; and about them were the symbolic forms of
        exile and death and every persecution, and the hideous laughter of
        triumphant enemies. All this seemed to weigh heavily upon the little man
        that had created it; Iliel thought that he was seeking incarnation for
        the sake of its forgetfulness.
        Yet the light in his eyes was so pure and noble and magnetic that it
        might have been that he saw in a new birth the chance to repair his
        error.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And now her attention was drawn to a yet nobler and still more
        fantastic form<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</a>.&nbsp;
        It was a kingly figure, and its eyes blazed bright with an
        enthusiasm that was tinged almost with madness. His creations, like
        those of the last seen, were something vague and unsubstantial. They
        lacked clear draughtsmanship. But they made up for this by their
        extravagance and brilliance. It was a gorgeous play of dream; yet Iliel
        could see that it was only dream.[226] Last of this company came a woman<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[5]</a>
        proud, melancholy, and sweet. Her face was noble and 
        intelligent;
        but there was a red line about her throat, and the eyes were suffused
        with horror, and about her heaved rolling mists of blood. And then the
        greater pageant spread its peacockry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;In this great group not only the men but all their spheres
        were clean-cut and radiant; for here was direct creation, no longer the
        derivative play of fancy upon existing themes. And first came one<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</a>
        &quot;with branded and ensanguined brow,&quot; a mighty figure, although
        suffering from a deformity of one foot, virile, herculean, intense but
        with a fierce sadness upon him. He came with a rush and roar as of many
        waters, and about him were a great company of men and women, almost as
        real as he was himself. And the waves (which Iliel recognized as music)
        surged about him, a stormy sea; and there were lightnings, and thunders,
        and desolations!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Behind him came another not unlike him, but with less vehemence;
        and instead of music were soft rays of light, rosy and harmonious; and
        his arms were folded upon his heart and his head bowed. It was clear
        that he understood his act as a sacrament.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then came a strange paradox of a man<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[7]</a>
        -- utter violence and extreme gentleness. A man at war within himself!
        And in his ecstasy of rage he peopled space with thousands of bright and
        vigorous phantasms. They were more real than those of all the others;
        for he fed them constantly with his own blood. Stern savagery, and lofty
        genius, hideous cruelty and meanness inexplicable, beauty, and madness,
        and holiness, and loving-kindness; these followed him, crying aloud with
        the exultation and the passion of their fullness of life. [227]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Close upon him came one<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[8]</a>
        who was all music, fierce, wild, mystical, and most melancholy. The
        waves of his music were like pines in the vast forest, and like the
        undulations of frozen&nbsp; steppes;
        but his own face was full of a calm glory touched with pity.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Behind him, frowning, came a hectic, ape-like dwarf<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[9]</a>.
        But in his train were many people of all climes, soft Indians, fierce
        Malays and Pathans and Sikhs, proud Normans, humble Saxons, and many a
        frail figure of woman. These were too self-assertive, Iliel thought, to
        be as real as those of the other man. And the figure himself was
        strained, even in his pride.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now came a marvellous person<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[10]</a>
        -- almost a god, she thought. For about him were a multitude of bones
        that built themselves up constantly into the loveliest living forms,
        that changed from one into another, ever increasing in stature and in
        glory. And in his broad brow she read the knowledge of the Unity of
        Things, and in these eyes the joy unspeakable which that knowledge
        gives. Yet they were insatiable as death itself; she could see that
        every ounce of the man's giant strength was strained toward some new
        attainment.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And now came another of the sons of music<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[11]</a>.&nbsp;
        But this man's waves were fiery flames like snakes contorted and
        terrible. It seemed to Iliel as if all heaven were torn asunder by those
        pangs. Wave strove with wave, and the battle was eaten up by fresh
        swords of fire that burst from him as he waved onward those battalions
        to fresh wrath. These waves moreover were peopled with immense and
        tragic figures; Iliel thought that she could recognize Electra, and
        Salome, daughter of Herodias.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Next, amid a cloud of angels bearing silver trumpets, came one<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[12]</a>
        with great height of brow, and eyes of golden flashes. In him the whole
        heaven [228] rocked with harmonious music, and faint shapes formed up
        among the waves, like Venus born of ocean foam. They had not substance,
        like so many Iliel had seen; they were too great, too godlike, to be
        human. Not one was there of whom it could not be said &quot;Half a woman
        made with half a god.&quot; And these, enormous and tragic, fiery, with
        wings and sandals of pure light, encompassed him and wooed him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Last of this company -- only a few of the visions are recorded
        here -- came the greatest of them all<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[13]</a>.
        His face was abrupt and vehement; but a veil was woven over it, because
        of the glory of his eyes, and a thick scarf, like a cloud, held over his
        mouth, lest the thunder of it destroy men's hearing. This man was so
        enormous that his stature spanned all heaven; and his creatures, that
        moved about him, were all godlike -- immensely greater than the human.
        Yet were they human; but so patriarchal, so intense, that they almost
        overwhelmed Iliel. On him she dared not look. He had the gift of making
        every thing a thousand times larger than its natural size. She heard one
        word of his, a mere call to a pet: &quot;Tiger, tiger!&quot; But the
        beast that broke through the mazes of heaven was so vast that its claws
        spanned star and star. And with all that he smiled, and a million
        babe-children blossomed before him like new-budded flowers. And this man
        quickened as he came nigh to Iliel; he seemed to understand wholly
        the nature of the Great Experiment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But every soul in all that glorious cohort of immortals, as it
        touched the cone, was whirled away like a pellet thrown upon a swiftly
        moving fly-wheel. And presently she perceived the cause of this.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The tip of the cone was sheathed in silver. So white and
        glittering with fierce heat was that corselot, and so mighty its pulse
        of vibration that she had [229] thought it part of the cone. She
        understood this to be the formula of the circle, and realized with a
        great ache, and then a sudden anger, that it was by this that she was to
        be prevented from what might have been her fortune, the gaining of the
        wardenship of a Chopin or of a Paul Verlaine.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But upon the face of Artemis was gaiety of triumph. The last of
        the souls whirled away into the darkness. Humanity had tried and failed;
        it was its right to try; it was its fate to fail; now came the turn of
        the chosen spirits, proved worthy of the fitted fastness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They came upon the Terrace in their legions, Valkyrie-brave in
        silver arms, or like priestesses in white vestments, their hair close
        bound upon their brows, or like queens of the woodland, swift for the
        chase, with loose locks and bright eyes, or like little children, timid
        and gracious.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But amid their ranks were the black hideous forms of hags, bent
        and wrinkled; and these fled instantly in fear at the vision of the
        blazing cone. There were many other animal shapes; but these, seeing the
        cone, turned away indifferent, as not understanding. Only the highest
        human-seeming forms remained; and these appeared as if in some
        perplexity. Constantly they looked from Artemis to the cone, and back
        again to Artemis. Iliel could feel their thought; it was a child-like
        bewilderment, &quot;But don't you understand? This is a most dangerous
        place. Why did
        you bring us here? Surely you know that to touch the cone is certain
        death to us?&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel understood. The human souls had long since made themselves
        perfect, true images of the cosmos, by accepting the formula of Love and
        Death; they had made the great sacrifice again and again; they were
        veterans of the spiritual world-war, and asked nothing better than to go
        back to the trenches. But these others were partial souls; they had not
        yet [230] attained humanity; they had not understood that in order to
        grow one must assimilate
        oneself with another being, the death of two to create the life of one,
        in whom the two live once more, transmuted
        and glorified, the corruptible having put on incorruption. To them
        incarnation was death; and they did not know that death was life. They
        were not ready for the Great Adventure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So they stood like tall lilies about the coruscating cone of
        Light, wondering, doubting, drooping. But at the last came one taller
        than all the rest, sadder of mien, and lovelier of features; her robes
        were stained and soiled, as if by contact with other colours. Artemis
        drew back with quick repulsion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For the first time the maiden goddess spoke.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;What is thy name?&quot; she cried.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am Malkah of the tribe of the Sickles.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And thy crime?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I love a mortal.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Artemis drew back once more.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Thou, too, hast loved,&quot; said Malkah.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I drew my mortal lovers unto me; I did not sully my life
        with theirs; I am virgin unto Pan!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I also am virgin; for whom I loved is dead. He<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[14]</a>
        was a poet, and he loved thee above women, `And haply the Queen-Moon is
        on her throne clustered around by all her starry fays` whereof I being
        one, loved him that he loved Thee! But he died in the city of Mars and
        the Wolf, before I could make him even aware of me. I am come hither to
        seek immolation; I am weary of the pale beauty of Levanah; I will seek
        him, at the price of death. I deny our life; I crucify myself unto the
        God we dare not name. I go. Hail and farewell!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She flung up her arm in a wild gesture of renunciation, and came
        closer to the Cone. She would not [231] haste, lest her will prove but
        impulse; she poised her breast deliberately over the Cone. Then, with
        fierce zest, so that the one blow might end all, she thrust herself
        vehemently down upon the blazing spike.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At that moment Iliel swooned. She felt that something had
        happened to her, something tremendous; and her brain turned crazily in
        her. But as she lost consciousness she was still aware of the last phase
        of the vision: that the sacrifice of Malkah had created a void in the
        ranks of the Amazon armies of the Moon; and she saw them and their mist
        of blue, licked up in the swirl of the vortex. The whole of the invoked
        forces were sucked up into her as Malkah in her death-agony took
        possession of that basis of materialization. Heroic -- and presumptuous;
        for of
        all the qualities that go to make humanity she had but one, and she
        would have to shift, for the rest, with orts of&nbsp;
        inheritance. Among mankind she would be a stranger, a being
        without conscious race-experience, liable to every error that a partial
        view of life can make. Ill indeed for such a one who is without the
        wardenship of high initiates! It was for Cyril Grey to keep her
        unspotted from the world, to utilize those powers which she wielded in
        pre-eminence from her inheritance in the white sphere of Levanah!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When Sister Clara came to summon Iliel, she found her still in
        swoon. They carried her to her room. At noon she recovered
        consciousness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey was seated by her bed. To her surprise, he was dressed
        in mundane attire, an elegant lounge suit of lavender.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Have you seen the papers?&quot; he cried gaily.
        &quot;Neapolitan Entomologists capture rare butterfly, genus
        Schedbarshamoth Scharthathan, species Malkah be-Tharshishim ve-Ruachoth
        ha-Sche-halim!&quot; [232]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't talk nonsense, Cyril!&quot; she said, lazily, a
        little uncertain whether this unexpected apparition were not a dream.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Perfect sense, I assure you, my child. The trick is turned.
        We have caught our Butterfly!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; she murmured; &quot;but how did you
        know?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Why, use your eyes!&quot; he cried. &quot;Use your br --- I
        should say your sensory organs! Look!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He waved at the window, and Iliel idly followed with her eyes.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There could be no mistake. The garden was normal. Every vestige
        of magical force had disappeared.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Couldn't have gone better,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't
        know where we're going, but we know we're on the way. And, whatever
        we've got, we've got it.&quot;
        
        </p>

        Suddenly her mind ran back to her vision. &quot;Where were you
        last night, Cyril?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He looked at her for a moment before replying.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I was where I always am,&quot; he said slowly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I looked for you all over the house and the garden.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ah! you should have sought me in the House of my
        Father.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Your father?&quot;
        
        </p>

        &quot;Colonel Sir Grant Ponsonby Grey, K.C.M.G., K.C.S.I.,
        G.C.I.E. Born in 1846 at the Round Tower, Co. Cork; educ. Winchester and
        Balliol; Lieutenant Royal Artillery 1868; Indian Political Department
        1873; in 188o m. Adelaide, only d. of the late Rt. Hon. Lord Ashley
        Lovell, P.C.; one s., Cyril St. John, q.v. Residence, The Round Tower,
        Co. Cork; Bartland Barrows, Wilts.; 93, Arlington Street. W. Clubs.
        Carlton, Athenaeum, Travellers',
        Hemlock, etc. Amusements: Hunting, talking shop.&quot; [233]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You dear incorrigible boy!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He took her hand and kissed it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And am I to see something of you now?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, we're all penny plain humans from now on. It's merely a
        question of defending you from the malice of Douglas and Co.; a much
        simpler job than blocking out nine-tenths of the Universe! Apart from
        that, we are just a jolly set of friends; only I see less of you than
        anyone else does, naturally.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Naturally!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, naturally. You have to be saved from all worry and
        annoyance; and if there's one thing in the world more annoying and
        worrying than a wife, it's a husband! With the others, you have nothing
        to quarrel about; and if you try it on Brother Onofrio, in particular,
        he simply sets in motion a deadly and hostile current of will by which
        you would fall slain or paralyzed, as if blasted by the lightning flash!
        Click!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel laughed; and then Sister Clara appeared with the rest of
        the garrison, the boys and maidens burdened with the means of breakfast;
        for this was a day of festival and triumph.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But, as he shook hands with her, Iliel discovered, with a shock,
        that she hated Brother Onofrio. [234]
