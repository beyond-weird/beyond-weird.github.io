        THE HOMUNCULUS; CONCLUSION OF THE FORMER ARGUMENT CONCERNING THE
        NATURE OF THE SOUL</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I AM going to be perfectly horrid,&quot; said Simon Iff,
        leaning over to Lisa, and measuring his words with the minutest care.
        &quot;I am going to do everything possible to damp your enthusiasm. I
        would rather have you start from cold and spark up well as you go, than
        have you go off with a spurt, and find yourself without petrol in the
        middle of the big rise.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I want you to take up this research because of your real
        love of knowledge, not because of your passion for Brother Cyril. And I
        tell you honestly that I am mortally afraid for you, because you live in
        extremes. It is good for a swift push to have that sudden energy of
        yours; but no research in science is to be taken by storm. You need
        infinite patience, nay, even infinite indifference to the very thing on
        which your heart is set:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, I have prated. The old man must utter his distrust of
        fiery youth. So we'll go on.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm going to talk to you about the soul again. Remember our
        conception of it, the idea that seemed to do away with all the
        difficulties at a blow. We had the idea of a soul, of a real physical
        substance, one of whose surfaces, or rather boundary-solids, was what we
        call body and mind. Body and mind are real, too, and truly belong to the
        soul, but are only minute aspects of it, just as any ellipse or
        hyperbola is an aspect of the section of a cone. [104]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We'll take just one more analogy in the lower dimensions as
        we pass.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How do solids know one another? Almost entirely by their
        surfaces! Except in chemistry, which we have reason to believe to be a
        fourth-dimensional science, witness the phenomena of polarization and
        geometrical isomerism, solids only make contact superficially.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then, shifting the analogy as we did before, how do
        fourth-dimensional beings know one another? By their bounding solids. In
        other words, my soul speaks to yours through the medium of our minds and
        bodies.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That is the common phrase? Quite so; but I am using it in
        an absolute physical sense. A line can only be aware of another line at
        a point of contact; a plane of another plane at the line where they cut;
        a cube of another cube at the surface common to both; and a soul of
        another soul where their ideas are in conjunction.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I do want you to grasp this with every fibre in your being;
        I believe it to be the most important thesis ever enunciated, and you
        will be proud to learn that it is wholly Brother Cyril's, with no help
        from me. Hinton, Rouse Ball, and others, laid the foundations; but it
        was he that put it in such a clear light, and correlated it with occult
        science.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You must give the honour to the Mahathera Phang!&quot;
        interjected Cyril. &quot;I was proving to him the metaphysical nature of
        the soul -- and he regarded me with so amused a smile that I perceived
        my asininity. Of course there can be but one order of Nature!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;In any case,&quot; continued Iff, &quot;this theory of
        Cyril's wipes the slate clean of every metaphysical speculation. Good
        and evil vanish instantly, with Realism and Nominalism, and Free will
        and [105] Determinism -- and all the 'isms' and all the 'ologies'! Life
        is reduced to mathematical formulae, indeed, as the Victorian scientists
        rightly wished to do; but at the same time mathematics is restored to
        her royal pre-eminence as not only the most exact, but the most exalted
        of the sciences. The intelligible order of things, moreover, becomes
        natural and inevitable; and such moral problems as the cruelty of
        organic life return to their real insignificance. The almost comic
        antinomy between man's size and his intelligence is reduced; and
        although the mystery of the Universe remains unsolved, at least it is a
        rational mystery, and neither senseless nor intolerable.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Let us now come down to a simple practical point. Here is a
        soul anxious to communicate with other souls. He can only do it by
        obtaining a mind and body. Now you'll notice, taking that cone image of
        ours again, that any section of it is always one of three regular
        curves. It would not fit into a square, for example, however you turned
        it. And so our soul has to look about for some mind which will fit one
        of his sections. There is a great deal of latitude, no doubt; for the
        mind grows, and is at first very plastic. But there must be some sort of
        relation. If I am
        a wandering soul, and wish to communicate with the soul now manifesting
        a section of itself as Professor of Electricity at Oxford, it is useless
        for me to take the mind of a Hottentot. (Cyril sighed a doubt.)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm going to digress for a moment. Look at the finished
        product, the soul 'incarnated,' as we may call it. There are three
        forces at work upon it; the soul itself, the heredity and the
        environment. A clever soul will therefore be careful to choose the
        embryo which seems most likely to be fairly free in the two latter
        respects. It will look for a healthy stock, for parents who will, and
        can, give the child every chance [106] in life. You must remember that
        every soul is, from our point of view, a 'genius,' for its world is so
        incalculably greater than ours that one spark of its knowledge is enough
        to kindle a new epoch in mankind.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But heredity and environment usually manage to prevent any
        of this coming to light. No matter how full of whisky a flask may be,
        you will never make it drunk!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;So we may perhaps conceive of some competition between
        souls for possession of different minds and bodies; or, let us say, to
        combine the ideas, different embryos. I hope you notice how this theory
        removes the objection to reincarnation, that one's mind does not
        remember 'the last time.' Why should our cone make connexion between its
        different curves? Each is so unimportant to it that it would hardly
        think of doing so. Yet there might be some similarity between successive
        curves (in our case, lives) that might make an historian suspect that
        they were connected; just as a poet's style would be constant in some
        respects, whether he wrote a war-story or a&nbsp; love-lyric.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You see, of course, by the way, how this theory does away
        with all the nonsense about 'Are the planets inhabited?' with its
        implication of idiotic waste if they be not. To us every grain of dust,
        every jet of hydrogen on the sun's envelope, is the manifestation of a
        section of some soul:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And here we find ourselves quite suddenly and unexpectedly
        in line with some of the old Rosicrucian doctrines.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This brings us to the consideration of certain experiments
        made by our predecessors. They had quite another theory of souls; at
        least, their language was very different to ours; but they wanted very
        much to produce a man who should not be bound up [107] in his heredity,
        and should have the environment which they desired
        for him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They started in paraphysical ways; that is, they repudiated
        natural generation altogether. They made figures of brass, and tried to
        induce souls to indwell them. In some accounts we read that they
        succeeded; Friar Bacon was credited with one such Homunculus; so was
        Albertus Magnus, and, I think, Paracelsus.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He had, at least, a devil in his long sword 'which taught
        him all the cunning pranks of past and future mountebanks,' or Samuel
        Butler, first of that dynasty, has lied.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But other magicians sought to make this Homunculus in a way
        closer to nature. In all these cases they had held that environment
        could be modified at will by the application of telesmata or sympathetic
        figures. For example, a nine-pointed star would attract the influence
        which they called Luna -- not meaning the actual moon, but an idea
        similar to the poets' ideas of her. By surrounding an object with such
        stars, with similarly-disposed herbs, perfumes, metals, talismans, and
        so on, and by carefully keeping off all other influences by parallel
        methods, they hoped to invest the original object so treated with the
        Lunar qualities, and no others. (I am giving the briefest outline of an
        immense subject.) Now then they proceeded to try to make the Homunculus
        on very curious lines.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Man, said they, is merely a fertilized ovum properly
        incubated. Heredity is there even at first, of course, but in a feeble
        degree. Anyhow, they could arrange any desired environment from the
        beginning, if they could only manage to nourish the embryo in some
        artificial way -- incubate it, in fact, as is done with chickens to-day.
        Furthermore, and this is the crucial point, they thought that by
        performing this [108] experiment in a specially prepared place, a place
        protected magically against all incompatible forces, and by invoking
        into that place some one force which they desired, some tremendously
        powerful being, angel or archangel -- and they had conjurations which
        they thought capable of doing this -- that they would be able to cause
        the incarnation of beings of infinite knowledge and power, who would be
        able to bring the whole world into Light and Truth.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I may conclude this little sketch by saying that the idea
        has been almost universal in one form or another; the wish has always
        been for a Messiah or Superman, and the method some attempt to produce
        man by artificial or at least abnormal means. Greek and Roman legend is
        full of stories in which this mystery is thinly veiled; they seem mostly
        to derive from Asia Minor and Syria. Here exogamic principles have been
        pushed to an amusing extreme. I need not remind you of the Persian
        formula for producing a magician, or of the Egyptian routine in the
        matter of Pharaoh, or of the Mohammedan device for inaugurating the
        Millenium. I did remind Brother Cyril, by the way, of this last point,
        and he did need it; but it did him no good, for here we are at the
        threshold of a Great Experiment on yet another false track!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;He is only taunting me to put me on my mettle,&quot;
        laughed Cyril.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Now I'm going to bring all this to a point,&quot; went on
        the old mystic. &quot;The Greeks, as you know, practised a kind of
        eugenics. (Of course, all tribal marriage laws are primarily eugenic in
        intention). But like the mediaeval magicians we were speaking of, with
        their Homunculus, the Greeks attached the greatest possible importance
        to the condition of the mother during gestation. She was encouraged to
        look only on beautiful statues, to read only [109] beautiful books. The
        Mohammedans, again,&nbsp; whose
        marriage system makes Christian marriage by comparison a thing for
        cattle, shut up a woman during that period, keep her perfectly quiet and
        free from the interference of her husband.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This is all very good, but it falls short of Brother
        Cyril's latest lunacy. As I understand him, he wishes indeed to proceed
        normally in a physical sense, but to prepare the way by making the
        heredity, and environment as attractive as possible to one special type
        of soul, and then -- to go soul-fishing in the Fourth Dimension!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Thus he will have a perfectly normal child, which yet is
        also a Homunculus in the mediaeval sense of the word!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And he has asked me to lend you the villa of the Order at
        Naples for the purpose.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa had lent forward; her face, between her hands was burning.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Slowly she spoke: &quot;You know that you are asking me to
        sacrifice my humanity?&quot; She was not silly enough to pretend to
        misunderstand the proposal and Simon liked her better for the way she
        took it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He thought a moment. &quot;I see now; I never thought of it
        before, and I am foolish, The conservatism of woman calls this sort of
        thing a 'heartless experiment.' Yet nothing is farther from our
        thoughts. There will be no action to annoy or offend you on the
        contrary. But I understand the feeling -- it is the swift natural
        repugnance to discuss what is sacred.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Tut--tut--my memory is always failing me these days,&quot;
        muttered Cyril; &quot;I've quite forgotten the percentage of children
        that were born blind in 1861.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa started to her feet. She did not know what he meant, but in
        some way it stung her like a serpent. [110]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff intervened. &quot;Brother Cyril, you always use strong
        medicine!&quot; he said, shaking his head; &quot;I sometimes think
        you're too keen to see your results.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I hate to beat about the bush. I say the thing that can
        never be forgotten,&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Or forgiven, sometimes,&quot; said the old man in gentle
        reproof.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But come, my dear, sit down; he meant truth, after all, and
        truth cuts only to cure. It's a brutal fact that children used to be
        born blind, literally by the thousand, because it wasn't quite nice to
        publish the facts about certain diseases; and precautions against them
        were called 'heartless experiments.' What Cyril is asking you to do is
        no more than what your whole heart craves for; only he wants to crown
        that with a gift to humanity such as has never yet been given. Suppose
        that you succeed, that you can attract a soul to you who will find a way
        to abolish poverty, or to cure cancer, or to -- oh! surely you glow with
        vision, a thousand heights of human progress thrusting their sunlit
        snows through the clouds of doubt!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa rose again to her feet, but her mood was no longer the same.
        She put her hands in Simon Iff's. &quot;I think you're a very noble
        man,&quot; she said, &quot;and it's an honour to work in such a
        cause.&quot; Cyril took her in his arms. &quot;Then you will come with
        me to Naples? To the Master's own villa?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She looked at Iff with a queer smile. &quot;May I make a
        joke?&quot; she said. &quot;I should like to rechristen the villa -- The
        Butterfly-Net!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simple Simon laughed with her like a child. It was just the
        delicate humour that appealed to him; and the classical allusion to the
        Butterfly as allegorical of the Soul showed him a side of the girl that
        he had hardly suspected. [111]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Cyril Grey swerved instantly to the serious aspect of the
        problem. &quot;We have merely been discussing an A.B. case,&quot; he
        said; &quot;we have forgotten where we stand. Somewhere or other I have
        made a blunder already, mark you! -- and we have the Black Lodge on our
        trail. You may possibly recall some of the events of yesterday?&quot; he
        concluded, with a touch of his old airy manner.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; said Simon, &quot;I think you had better get to
        business.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We discussed the thing on general lines during your vigil
        last night,&quot; said Cyril. &quot;Our first need is defence. The
        strongest form of defence is counter-attack; but you should arrange for
        that to take shape as far as possible from the place you are defending,
        In this game you are keeping goal, Lisa; I am full back; Simple Simon is
        the captain playing at half-back; and I think we have a fairly fit
        eleven! So that's all right. There is reason to believe that the enemy's
        goal is in Paris itself. And if we can keep the ball in their half all
        through the game, you and I can spend a very quiet year in Italy.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I can't follow all that football slang; but do explain why
        anyone should want to interfere with us. It's too silly.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's only silly when you get to the very distant end of a
        most abstruse philosophy. On the surface it's obvious. It's the
        objection of the burglar to electric lights and bells. You can imagine
        him having enough foresight to vote against a town councillor who
        proposed an appropriation for the study of science in general. Something
        might turn up which would put him out of business.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But what is their business?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ultimately, you may call it selfishness -- only that's a
        dreadful word, and will mislead you. We're [112] just as selfish; only
        we realize that other things beyond our own consciousnesses are equally
        ourselves. For instance, I try to unite myself as intimately as I can
        with every other mind, or body, or idea, that comes in my way. To take
        that cone simile, I want to be all the different curves I can, so as to
        have a better chance of realizing the cone. The Black Lodge magician
        clings to his one curve, tries to make it permanent, to exalt it above
        all other curves. And of course the moment the cone shifts, out he goes:
        pop!&quot;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Observe the poet!&quot; remarked Simon Iff. &quot;He values
        himself enormously; but his idea of perpetuating himself is to make the
        beauty that is inherent in his own soul radiate beyond him so as to
        illumine every other mind in the world. But your Black Magician is
        secret, and difficult of access; he isn't going to tell anyone anything,
        not he! So even his knowledge tends to extinction, in the long
        run.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you are yourselves a secret society!&quot; exclaimed
        Lisa.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Only to secure freedom from interruption. It is merely the
        same idea as that which makes every householder close his doors at
        night; or, better, as public libraries are guarded by certain
        regulations. We can't allow lunatics to scrawl over our unique
        manuscripts, and tear the pages out of all our books. Shallow people are
        always chattering about science being free to all; the truth is that it
        is guarded as no other secret ever was in all history, by the simple
        fact that, with all the help in the world, it takes half a lifetime to
        begin to master even one small section of it. We guard our magick just
        as much and as little as our other branches of physics; but people are
        so stupid that, though they know it requires years of training to use so
        simple an instrument as a [113] microscope, they are indignant that we
        cannot teach them to use the Verendum in an hour.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ah, but they complain that you have never proved the use of
        the Verendum at all.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Only those who have not learnt its use. I can read Homer,
        but I can only prove the fact to another man by teaching him Greek; and
        he is then obliged to do the same to a third party, and so on. People
        generally acquiesce that some men can read Homer because -- well, it's
        their intellectual laziness. A really stout intelligence would doubt it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Spiritualism and Christian Science, which are either fraud
        or bluff or misinterpretation of facts, have spread all over the
        Anglo-Saxon world because there is no true critical spirit among the
        half-educated. But we are not willing to have our laboratories invaded
        by reporters and curiosity-mongers; we are dealing with delicate forces;
        we have to train our minds we with an intensity which no other study in
        the world demands. Public indifference and incredulity suit us
        perfectly. The only object of advertisement would be to get suitable
        members; but we have methods
        of finding them without publicity. We make no secret of our methods and
        results, on the other hand; but only the right man knows how to discover
        them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is not as if we were working in an old field where all
        the terms were defined, and the main laws ascertained. In Magick, even
        more than in any other science, the student must keep his practice level
        with his theory.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't you ever do magick under test conditions?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Unfortunately, my child, creative magick, which is the
        thaumaturgic side of the business, depends on a peculiar excitation
        which objects to 'test conditions' very strongly. You might as well ask
        Cyril to prove his poetic gift, or even his manhood, before a set of
        [114] fools. He will produce you poems, and infants, and events, as the
        case may be; but you have more or less to take his word for it that he
        did the acts responsible primarily for them. Another difficulty about
        true magick is that it is so perfectly a natural process that its
        phenomena never excite surprise except by their timeliness -- so that
        one has to record hundreds of experiments to set up a case which will
        even begin to exclude coincidence. For instance, I want a certain book.
        I use my book-producing talisman. The following day, a bookseller offers
        me the volume. One experiment proves nothing. My ability to do it every
        time is the proof. And I can't even do that under 'test conditions'; for
        it is necessary that I should really want the book, in my
        subconsciousness, whose will works the miracle. It is useless for me to
        think, or pretend, that I want it. Any man may fluke a ten-shot at
        billiards, but you call him a player only when he can average a&nbsp;
        break of thirty or so every time he goes to the table.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But in some branches of magick we can give proof on the spot; in
        any branch, that is, where the female, and not the male, part of us is
        concerned. The analogy is quite perfect. Thus, in my guess at your
        birth-hour -- was not that a test? I will do it all day, and be right
        five times in six. Further, in the event of error, I will show exactly
        why I was wrong. It's a case where one is sometimes right to be wrong,
        as I'll explain one day. Then again, your own clairvoyance; I did not
        tell you that sort of a Thing to look for; yet you saw it under the same
        form as I did. You shall practice these things daily with Cyril if you
        like, always checking your results in a way which he will show you; and
        in a month you will be an expert. Then, if you feel you want to
        advertise, do. But you won't.
        
        </p>
        <p>Besides,
        the real trouble is that not one person in a thousand cares for [115]
        any form of science whatever; even such base applications of science as
        the steam-engine and all its family, from the telegraph to the
        automobile, were only thrust upon the unwilling people by bullies who
        knew that there was money in them. Who are your 'men of science' in the
        popular notion of to-day? Edison and Marconi, neither of whom ever
        invented anything, but were smart business men, with the capacity to
        exploit the brains of others, and turn science to commercially useful
        and profitable ends. Heigho!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We're a long way from our subject,&quot; said Cyril.
        &quot;I have had a delightful morning -- I have felt like Plato with the
        Good, the True, and the Beautiful in contemplating you three -- but we
        have work before us. I propose in this emergency to copy the tactics of
        Washington at Valley Forge. We will make a direct and vehement attack on
        the Black Lodge: they will expect me to be in my usual position in the
        van -- I will slip away with Lisa while the fires blaze brightest.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A sound plan,&quot; said Simon. &quot;Let us break up this
        conference, and put it immediately into execution. You had better not
        attract attention by collecting luggage, and you must certainly take no
        person outside the Order into your circle. So after dinner you will put
        on your other clothes, walk down to the Metro, cross to the Gare de
        Lyon, and jump into the Rome rapide. Wire me when you arrive at The
        Butterfly-Net!&quot; [116]
