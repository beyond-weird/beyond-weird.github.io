        DARK SIDE OF THE MOON
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        THE spring gathered her garments together, then flung them wide
        over the Bay of Naples. Hers is the greatest force in Nature, because
        her clarion sounds the summons of creation. It is she that is the
        Vicegerent of the All-Father, and of His spirit hath He dowered her with
        a triple essence.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In southern lands, even before the Equinox opens its gates before
        her conquering armies, one feels her imminent. Her light-armed troops
        swarm over the breached ramparts of the winter, and their cry is echoed
        in the dungeons of the soul by those whom she has come to save.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet in her hands is nothing but a sword. It is a disturbance of
        the equilibrium to which the dying year has attained after its long joy
        and agony; and so to the soul which is at ease she comes with alarum and
        tocsin. A soul like Iliel's, naturally apt to receive every impulse, to
        multiply it, and to transform it into action, is peculiarly sensitive,
        without knowing it, to cosmic forces so akin to its own inborn
        turbulence.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In her idlest moods, Lisa la Giuffria would have started for
        China at the least provocation, provided that she could start within the
        hour.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She could take a lover, or throw one away, a dozen times in a
        year, and would have been indignant and amazed if any one had called her
        fickle. She was not insincere; but she believed with her whole soul
        [250] that her immediate impulse was the true Will of her whole Self.
        One night at the Savoy Hotel with Lavinia King, just before Christmas,
        the talk had turned on the distress then prevailing in London. Instantly
        she had dragged the whole party downstairs, provided it with the entire
        supply of silver money that the hotel happened to have on hand, and
        rushed it to the Embankment to rescue the unemployed. That night she was
        a super-Shaftsbury; she formulated a dozen plans to solve the problem of
        poverty, root, branch, and leaf; and the next morning her dressmaker
        found her amid a sheaf of calculations.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But a new style of costume being displayed, she had plunged with
        equal ardour into a cosmopolitan scheme of dress reform.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To such an one a thwarted impulse involves almost a wreckage of
        the soul. Iliel began openly to chafe at the restrictions to which her
        own act had bound her. She had never been a mother, and the mere
        physical disabilities of her condition were all the more irritating
        because they were so unfamiliar.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The excitement of the Butterfly-chase had kept her toe to the
        mark, and the strange circumstances with which she was surrounded had
        aided to make it easy for her. It flattered her vanity that she was the
        keystone of so great an arch, destined to span earth and heaven. Her new
        conditions, the relaxation of the tension, threw down her exaltation.
        The experiment was over; well, then, it ought to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">be</i>
        over -- and she had months of boredom before her which must be endured
        with no stimulus but that of normal human duty. She was one of those
        people who will make
        any sacrifice at the moment, beggar themselves to help a friend, but who
        are quite incapable of drawing a weekly cheque for a trifling sum for no
        matter how important a purpose. [251]&nbsp;
        
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In this March and April she was one mass of thwarted impulse. The
        mere necessity, demanded by safety, of remaining within the circle, was
        abhorrent to her. But, though she did not know it, she was held in
        subjection by the wills of her guardians.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In Astrology, the moon, among its other meanings, has that of
        &quot;the common people,&quot; who submit (they know not why) to any
        independent will that can express itself with sufficient energy. The
        people who guillotined the mild Louis XVI died gladly for Napoleon. The
        impossibility of an actual democracy is due to this fact of
        mob-psychology. As soon as you group men, they lose their personalities.
        A parliament of the wisest and strongest men
        in the nation is liable to behave like a set of schoolboys, tearing up
        their desks and throwing their inkpots at each other. The only
        possibility of co-operation lies in discipline and autocracy, which men
        have sometimes established in the name of equal rights.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now Iliel was at present a microcosm of the Moon, and her
        resentments were either changed into enthusiasms by a timely word from
        Sister Clara or one of the others, or else ignored. The public is a
        long-suffering dumb beast, an ass crouching beneath heavy burdens, and
        it needs not only unendurable ill-treatment, but leadership, before it
        will revolt. All Iliel's impulses were purposeless, negative things,
        ideas rather of&nbsp; escape than
        of any definite programme. She wanted to jump out of the frying-pan,
        neither fearing the fire nor having any clear idea of how to act when
        she got there. She lacked so much as a day-dream of any alternative
        Future; hers was the restless wretchedness of a morphineuse deprived of
        the drug.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was, as it were, the place where four winds met; and such a
        place is dangerous for a ship that is without internal means of
        propulsion. She sagged, [252] a dismasted derelict, in tow of Cyril
        Grey; and the rope of love which held her to him strained her creaking
        timbers.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The first evidence of these very indefinite feelings was shown by
        her unreasonableness. Under the rigid discipline of the ceremonies, she
        had been too well schooled, too absorbed, too directly under the
        influence of the forces invoked, to feel or express constraint; the mere
        human hygiene of her present position served only to make her more
        discontented. A similar phenomenon has been observed also with
        democracies; they are happiest when most thoroughly cowed and bullied.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Once or twice she treated Cyril to an outburst of temper; but he
        was very young, so he was tactless enough to refuse to be angry, and
        made every allowance for her. Such treatment insults women like Lisa;
        their rage smoulders in them. A blow and a caress would have tripled her
        passion for him. &quot;What is the use of being a Chinese god,&quot; she
        might have asked, &quot;if you do not gratify your worshippers by
        inflicting Chinese tortures?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the principal manifestation of her moral instability was in
        her whims.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        These were in some degree, no doubt, due to her physical
        condition; but the mental stress exaggerated them to an abnormal height,
        like a glacier cramped between two mountain chains. It is necessary, in
        this world, to be made of harder stuff than one's environment. But Iliel
        had no ambition to any action; she was reflex; simple reaction to
        impression was what she thought her will. And so she inflicted
        phantasies upon the patient fold about her; one day she was all for
        dressing herself strangely; another day she would insist upon a masque
        or a charade; but she took no true pleasure in any of these things.&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey was assiduous in meeting her desires; [253] there
        were
        but two prohibitions left of all the elaborate restrictions of the
        second stage of the experiment; she might not be unduly intimate with
        him, and she might not in any way communicate with the outside world. In
        other words, the citadel and the ramparts must be kept intact; between
        these was a wide range for whim.&nbsp; Yet she was not content; it was just those two forbidden
        things that haunted her. (The serpent is a later invention in the story
        of
        the Fall!) Her unconscious wish to violate these rules led to a dislike
        for those who personified their rigidity; namely Cyril Grey and Brother
        Onofrio. And her febrile mind began to join these separate objects in a
        common detestation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This shewed itself in a quite insane jealousy of their perfectly
        natural and necessary intimacy. Sometimes, as they sat sunning
        themselves upon the wall of one of the terraces she would come flaming
        down the garden with some foolish tale, and Brother Onofrio at least
        could not wholly hide his annoyance. He was naturally anxious to make
        all he could out of the presence of the more advanced adept; and his
        inborn ecclesiastical contempt for women showed through the tissue of
        his good manners. Cyril's most admirable patience tried her even more
        sorely. &quot;Are you my lover or my grandfather?&quot; she screamed at
        him one night, when he had been more than usually tactful.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Had the matter rested there, it had been ill enough with her. But
        the mind of man is a strange instrument. &quot;Satan finds some mischief
        still for idle hands to do&quot; is a rattling good piece of psychology.
        Iliel had nothing to occupy her mind, because she had never trained
        herself to concentrate the current of her thoughts on one thing, and off
        all others. A passion for crochet-work has saved many a woman from the
        streets or the river. And as on marshes [254] methane forms, and Will o'
        th' Wisp lures peasants to their oozy doom, so in the idle mind monsters
        are bred. She began to suffer from a real insanity of the type of
        persecution-mania. She began to imagine that Cyril and Brother Onofrio
        were engaged in some mysterious plot against her. It was lucky that
        every one in the house possessed medical knowledge and training, with
        specialization in psychology, so that they knew precisely how to treat
        her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet in the long run that very knowledge became a danger. The
        extraordinary powers of mind -- in certain limited directions -- which
        insanity often temporarily confers, enabled her to see that she was
        regarded as in a critical mental state. She accepted the situation as a
        battle, instead of co-operating in frank friendship, and began to
        manoeuvre to outwit her guardians. Those who have any experience of
        madness, or its congeners, drug-neuroses, know how infernally&nbsp;
        easy was her task. Many's the woman who, with her pocket
        handkerchief to her face, and the tears pouring from her eyes, has
        confessed all to the specialist, and begged him to break her of the
        whisky habit, the while she absorbed a pint or so of the said whisky
        under cover of the said pocket handkerchief.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel simply noted the states of mind which they thought
        favourable, and simulated them. Peaceful absorption in nature,
        particularly in the moon when she was shining, pleased them; and she
        cultivated these states, knowing that the others never disturbed her at
        such times; and, thus secured, she gave herself over to the most hideous
        thoughts.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They were in fact the thoughts of madness. It is a strange fact
        that the most harmless states of mind, the most correct trains of idea,
        may accompany a dangerous lunacy. The difference is that the madman
        makes a secret of his fancies. Lord Dunsany's [255] stories are the
        perfect prose jewels of a master cutter and polisher, lit by the rays of
        an imagination that is the godlike son of the Father of All Truth and
        Light; but if he kept them to himself,
        they would be the symptoms of an incurable lesion of the brain. A madman
        will conceal the Terrible Secret that &quot;today is Wednesday,&quot;
        perhaps &quot;because the devil told him to do so.&quot; &quot;I am He
        who is Truth&quot; was the boast of a great mystic, Mansur, and they
        stoned him for it, as they stone all men who speak truth; but had he
        said &quot;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hush!</i> I am
        God!&quot; he would have been merely a maniac.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So Iliel acquired the habit of spending a great part of the day
        in her cradle, and there indulging her mind in every possible morbidity.
        The very fact that she could not go on to action served to make the
        matter worse. It is a terrible error to let any natural impulse,
        physical or mental, stagnate. Crush it out, if you will, and be done
        with it; or fulfil it, and get it out of the system; but do not allow it
        to remain there and putrefy. The suppression of the normal sex instinct,
        for example, is responsible for a thousand ills. In Puritan countries
        one inevitably finds a morbid preoccupation with sex coupled with every
        form of perversion and degeneracy. Addiction to excess of drink,
        and to the drug habits, which are practically unknown in Latin
        countries, increase one's admiration at the Anglo-Saxon temperament.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Thus also Iliel's stagnant mind bred fearsome things. Hour after
        hour, the pageant of diseased thoughts passed through the shadowy gulfs
        of her chaotic spirit. Actual phantoms took shape for her, some
        seductive, some menacing; but even the most hideous and cruel symbols
        had a fierce fascination for her. There was a stag-beetle, with flaming
        eyes, a creature as big as an elephant, with claws in constant motion,
        that threatened her continually. [256] Horribly as this frightened her,
        she gloated on it, pictured its sudden plunge with those ghastly
        mandibles upon
        her flanks. Her own fatness was a source of curious perverse pleasure to
        her; one of her favourite reveries was to imagine herself the centre of
        a group of cannibals, watch them chop off great lumps from her body, and
        seethe them in the pot, or roast them on a spear, hissing and dripping
        blood and grease, upon the fire. In some insane or atavistic confusion
        of mind this dream was always recognized as being a dream of love. And
        she understood, in some sub-current of thought, why Suffragettes forced
        men to use violence upon them; it is but a repressed sexual instinct
        breaking out in race-remembrance of marriage by capture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But more dangerous even than such ideas were many which she
        learned to group under a name which one of them gave her. It was not a
        name that one can transcribe in any alphabet, but it was exactly like a
        very short slight cough, hardly more than a clearing of the throat, a
        quite voluntary cough of the apologetic type. She had only to make this
        little noise, and immediately a certain landscape opened before her. She
        was walking on a narrow ribbon of white path that wound up a very gentle
        slope. On either side of her were broad rough screes, with sparse grass
        and scrub peeping between the stones. The path led up to a pass between
        two hills, and near the crest of the ridge were two towers, one on
        either side of the path, as if for defence. These towers were squat and
        very ugly, with no windows, but mere slits for archery, and they had no
        sign of habitation. Yet she was quite sure that Something lived there,
        and she was conscious of the most passionate anxiety to visit whoever it
        might be. The moon, always in her wane, shone bright above the path, but
        little of her illumination extended beyond those narrow limits. [257]
        Upon the screes she could see only faint shadows, apparently of some
        prowling beast of the jackal or hyena type, for she could hear howling
        and laughing, with now and again fierce snarls and cries as though a
        fight were in progress &quot;in that fell cirque.&quot; But nothing ever
        crossed the path itself, and she would walk along it with a sense of the
        most curious lightness and pleasure. It was often her intention to go to
        the towers;
        but always she was deterred from doing so by the Old Lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was at a sharp turn of the path round an immense boulder that
        this individual usually appeared, coming from a cleft in its face. On
        the first occasion she had herself greeted the Old Lady, asking if she
        could assist her. For the Old Lady was seated on the ground, working
        very hard.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;May I help you?&quot; said Iliel, &quot;in whatever you are
        doing?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Old Lady sighed very bitterly, and said that she was trying
        to make a fire.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you haven't got any sticks.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We never use sticks to make a fire -- in this
        country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The last three words were in sing-song.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then what do you burn?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Anything round, and anything red, and anything ripe -- in this
        country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And how do you kindle it? Have you matches, or do you rub
        sticks together, or do you use the sun's rays through a
        burning-glass?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hush! there is no phosphorus, nor any sticks, nor any sun
        -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then how do you get fire?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There is no fire -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you said you were making a fire!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trying</i> to make a
        fire, my dear; we are always trying, and never succeeding -- in this
        country.&quot; [258]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And how long have you been trying?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There is no time -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel was half hypnotized by the reiteration of that negation,
        and that final phrase. She began to play a game.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, Old Lady, I've something round, and something red,
        and something ripe to make your fire with. I'll give it to you if you
        can guess what it is.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Old Lady shook her head. &quot;There's nothing round, and
        there's nothing red, and nothing ripe -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, I'll tell you: it's an apple. If you want it, you may
        have it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;We never want anything -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, I'll go on.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There's no going on -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, but there is, and I'm off.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't you know what a treasure we have -- in this
        country?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;No -- what is it?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Old Lady dived into the cleft of the rock, and came out again
        in a moment with a monkey, and a mouse-trap, and a mandolin.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I began,&quot; she explained, &quot;with an arrow, and an
        adder, and an arquebus; for there are terrible dangers in the beginning
        -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But what are they good for?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Nothing at all -- in this country. But I'm changing them
        for a newt, and a narwhal, and a net, hoping that one day I may get to
        the end, where one needs a zebra, a zither, and a zarape', and one can
        always exchange those for something round, and red, and ripe -- in this
        country.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was really a sort of child's fairy story that Iliel was
        telling herself; but the teller was independent of her conscious mind,
        so that she did not know what was coming next. And really the Old Lady
        was quite a [259] personality. On the second occasion she showed Iliel
        how to use her treasure. She made the monkey play the mandolin, and set
        the mouse-trap; and sure enough the newt and the narwhal, attracted by
        the music swam up and
        were duly caught. As for the net, the Old Lady bartered her three
        treasures for Iliel's hair-net.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm afraid it isn't very strong to catch things with,&quot;
        she said.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I only need an orange, and an oboe, and an octopus; and
        they are easy enough to catch -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Little by little the Old Lady beguiled Iliel, and one day, while
        they were setting a trap to catch a viper, and a vineyard, and a violin
        with their unicorn, and their umbrella, and their ukulele, she suddenly
        stopped short, and asked Iliel point-blank if she would like to attend
        the Sabbath on Walpurgis-night -- the eve of May-day -- for
        &quot;there's a short cut to it, my dear, from this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel revolted passionately against the idea, for she scented
        something abominable; but the Old Lady said:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Of course we should disguise you; it would never do for you
        to be recognized by Cyril, and Brother Onofrio, and Sister Clara; they
        wouldn't like to know you live -- in this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&quot;I don't,&quot; said Iliel, rather angrily, &quot;I
        only come out here for a walk.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ah, my dear,&quot; chuckled the Old Lady, &quot;but a
        walk's as good as a whale -- in this country. And you remember that the
        whale didn't put out Jonah where he wanted to go, but where somebody
        else wanted him. And that's the breed of whale we have -- in this
        country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;How do you know they'll be there on Walpurgis-night?&quot;
        [260]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;A how's as good as a hen -- in this country. And what a hen
        doesn't know you may ask of a hog, and what a hog doesn't know you may
        ask of a horse, and what a horse doesn't know isn't worth knowing -- in
        this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel was in a black rage against her friends -- why had they not
        asked her to come with them? And she went back that day in a vile
        temper.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This adventure of the Old Lady was only one of many; but it was
        the most vital, because the most coherent. Indeed, it led in the end to
        results of importance. For Iliel agreed to go to the Sabbath on
        Walpurgis-night. The Old Lady was very mysterious as to the method of
        travel. Iliel had expected conventionality on that point; but the Old
        Lady said:
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There are no goats, and no broomsticks -- in this
        country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Most of her visions were simply formless and incoherent horrors.
        Her foolish thoughts and senseless impulses took shape, usually in some
        distortion of an animal form, with that power of viscosity which is to
        vertebrates the most loathsome of all possibilities of life, since it
        represents the line of development which they have themselves avoided,
        and is therefore to them excremental in character. But to Iliel's
        morbidity the fascination of these things was overpowering. She took an
        unnatural and morose delight in watching the cuttle-fish squeeze itself
        slowly into a slime as black and oozy as the slug, and that again send
        trickling feelers as of leaking motor-oil, greasy and repulsive, with a
        foul scum upon its surface, until the beast looked like some parody of a
        tarantula; then this again
        would collapse, as if by mere weariness of struggle against gravitation,
        and spread itself slowly as a pool of putrefaction,
        which was yet intensely vital and personal by reason of its power to
        suck up [261] everything within its sphere of sensation. It struck her
        that such creatures were images of Desire, a cruel and insatiable
        craving deprived of any will or power to take a single step towards
        gratification; and she understood that this condition was the most
        hideous and continual torture, agony with no ray of hope, impotence so
        complete as even to inhibit an issue in death. And she knew, too, that
        these shapes were born of her own weaknesses; yet, so far from rousing
        herself to stamp them out in her mind, she gloated upon their
        monstrosity and misery, took pleasure in their anguish, which was her
        own, and fed them with the substance of her own personality and will. It
        was this, a spiritual &quot;Nostalgie de la boue,&quot; which grew upon
        her like a cancer or a gangrene; treacheries of the body itself, so that
        the only possible remedy is instant extirpation; for once the flesh
        abandons its will to firmness, to organization, and to specialized
        development, its degeneration into formless putrefaction becomes an
        accelerating rush upon a steepening slope.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        How tenuous is the thread by which man climbs to the stars! What
        concentration of the sub-conscious will of the race, through a thousand
        generations, has determined his indomitable ascent! A single slackness,
        a single false step, and he topples into the morass wherein his feet
        still plash! Degeneration is the most fatally easy of all human
        possibilities; for the fell tug of cosmic inertia, that pressure of the
        entire universe which tends to the homogeneous, is upon man
        continuously; and becomes constantly more urgent the more he advances
        upon his path
        of differentiation. It is more than a fable, Atlas who supports the
        Universe upon his shoulders, and Hercules, the type of the man, divinely
        born indeed, who must yet regain Olympus by his own fierce toil, taking
        upon himself that infinite load. [262]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The price of every step of progress is uncounted, even in myriads
        of lives self-sacrificed; and every man who is unfaithful to himself is
        not only at war with the sum of things, but his own comrades turn upon
        him to destroy him, to crush out his individuality and energy, to
        assimilate him to their own pullulating mass. It is indeed the power of
        the Roman Empire which erects the Cross on Calvary; but there must needs
        be Caiaphas and Herod, so blind that they crush out their own one hope
        of salvation from that iron tyranny; and also a traitor among those who
        once &quot;left all and followed&quot; the Son of Man.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And who shall deny true Godhead to humanity, seeing that no
        generation of mankind has been without a Saviour, conscious of his
        necessary doom, and resolute to meet it, his face set as a flint towards
        Jerusalem? [263]
