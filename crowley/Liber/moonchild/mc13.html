        THE PROGRESS OF THE GREAT EXPERIMENT; NOT FORGETTING
        OUR FRIENDS LAST SEEN IN PARIS, ABOUT WHOSE
        WELFARE MUCH ANXIETY MUST HAVE BEEN FELT</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        EARLY in January Cyril Grey received a letter from Lord Antony
        Bowling. &quot;My good Grey,&quot; it began, &quot;may the New Year
        bring you courage to break your resolutions early! My own plan is to
        swear off every kind of virtue, so that I triumph even when I fall!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Morningside is off to America with his New Discovery in
        Science. It is that all crime is due to breathing. Statistics show (a)
        that all convicts are guilty of this disgusting habit; (b) it is
        characteristic of all the inmates of our insane asylums.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;On the other hand, neither crime nor insanity has ever been
        proved against any person who was not an habitual breather. The case, as
        you see, is complete. Morningside has gone even farther, and shown that
        breathing is akin to drug-habits; he has made numerous experiments upon
        addicts, and finds that suppression leads
        to mental and physical distress of an even more acute type than that
        which follows the removal of morphia or cocaine from their slaves. There
        is little doubt that Congress will take immediate action to penalize
        this filthy vice as it deserves, and Fresh Air will be included among
        the drugs to which the Harrison Law applies. Hot Air, as the natural
        food of the People, will of course be permitted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I saw Sister Cybele the other day. She was [171] passing
        through London to visit friends in Scotland. I tried to alleviate that
        dreadful destiny by asking her to dinner, and we had an amusing seance
        with my new toy, a youth named Roger Blunt, who is controlled by a
        spirit called Wooloo, has eight secondary personalities, and causes
        pencils to adhere to walls. It cannot be that this is varnish, or
        surface tension, or a little of both; it would be too, too cruel!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The Mahathera Phang has vanished from our gaze; he has
        probably gone to the Equator to correct the obliquity of the Ecliptic in
        the interest of the Law of Righteousness. I'm sorry; I believe in that
        man; I know he's got something that I haven't, and I want it. However,
        Simple Simon has been nice to me; only he won't talk Phenomena -- says
        that, like a certain Pope, he has seen too many miracles to believe in
        them. Which is my own case, only he is referring to genuine ones. Hence
        difficulty in comprehension of his attitude.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I hope you're having a great time with the devil; I envy
        your blue skies; London is wrapped in fog, and even on fine days I have
        to go to the War Office. But isn't it a pity those wicked bad naughty
        men know where you are? I have my doubts about magick; but I know
        Balloch, and he's the rottenest egg in London. I gather he's at the back
        of it. Some blackmailing articles on you, again; but as Morningside
        would say, you should worry. Come along
        and see me before, in a moment of madness and despair, you plunge into
        Vesuvius in the hope of exciting a future Mathew Arnold to immortalize
        you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, here's the best to you!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;ANTONY BOWLING.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There was a brief note, too, from Simon Iff. &quot;It's to be
        supposed all's well; rumours of disaster to enemy offensive current in
        Paris. You had better [172] worry along on your own now; there's other
        fish frying in this kitchen. An old man may possibly drop in on you
        early in August; you may recognize him -- with
        a strong pair of glasses -- as your old friend, -- SIMON IFF.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simple Simon never spoke of himself as &quot;I&quot; in a letter;
        he only used the pronoun in conversation as a concession to custom. 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Black Commissioners had also heard from headquarters; Gates
        was replaced, as quick as rail could carry, by a man of superior
        advancement in the Black Lodge.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This was the celebrated Dr. Victor Vesquit, the most famous
        necromancer of his age. There was really little harm in the man beyond
        his extraordinary perversion in the matter of corpses. His house in
        Hampden Road was not only a rendezvous of spiritualists, but a Home for
        Lost Mummies. He based all his magical operations upon dead bodies, or
        detached portions of the same, believing that to endow dead matter with
        life -- the essential of nearly all magick, as he quite rightly saw --
        it was best to choose matter in which life had recently been manifest.
        An obvious corollary is that the best bodies are those that have met a
        violent death, rather than those which have been subjected to illness
        and decay. Also, it followed that the best corpses of all were those of
        executed murderers, whose vitality may be assumed as very great --
        though on this last point Cyril Grey, for one, would have disagreed with
        him, saying that the most vital people would have too much respect for
        the principle of life to commit murder in cold blood.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, Dr Vesquit had obtained an appointment as coroner in the
        most murderous district of London; and uncanny were the rumours that
        circulated among occult sympathizers. [173]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His career had nearly been ruined on two occasions by scandal.
        The notorious Diana Vaughan, it had been said, was his mistress; and he
        had become her accomplice in the introduction of the frightful sect of
        the Palladists.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The rumour was not widespread, and Vesquit need not have
        suffered; but he took alarm, and had the unlucky thought of employing
        Arthwait to write a book clearing him from all suspicion, by which it
        naturally was fixed on him for ever.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The second trouble was his little quarrel with Douglas. Vesquit
        was Senior in the Black Lodge, and Douglas overthrew him by
        &quot;carelessly&quot; leaving, in a hansom cab, some documents
        belonging to the Lodge, with Vesquit's name and address attached to
        them, which made some exceedingly grim revelations of the necromantic
        practices carried on in Hampden Road.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The honest cabby had turned over the papers to Scotland Yard, as
        his duty was; and the police had sent them on to those in authority over
        coroners; and Vesquit received, with his documents, an intimation that
        he must drop that sort of thing at once.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To be chief in the Lodge seemed less than to be always in a
        Paradise of corpses; so he resigned office, and Douglas pushed his
        advantage by making him an abject tool, under the perpetual threat of
        exposure.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        No sooner did Douglas learn of the death of Gates than he
        telegraphed to Arthwait to get the inquest adjourned &quot;so that the
        relatives of the deceased in England might attend, and take possession
        of the body,&quot; and to Vesquit to attend the same. On this occasion
        the coroner needed no threat -- the job was after his own heart.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas met him in Paris in high glee, for he was not sorry to be
        rid of Gates; and, on the other hand, the man had died in full tide of
        battle, and should be the very corpse that Vesquit most needed; as
        Douglas himself said, with a certain grim humour in which he excelled,
        he was, morally speaking, an executed criminal; while, being in actual
        magical contact with Grey and his friends, so much so that he had
        evidently been killed by them, he was an ideal magical link.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Vesquit's task was, if possible, to learn from Gates exactly what
        had happened, and so expert a necromancer had no fear of the result. He
        was also to create a semi-material ghost of Gates from the remains, and
        send it to the person who had dealt out death to that unlucky wizard.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        On his arrival at Naples, there was no difficulty in the way of
        the Black Lodge; the authorities were only too glad to return a formal
        verdict of death by misadventure, and to hand over the corpse to the
        rejoicing Vesquit.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Gates had fortunately left memoranda, a rough diary of the
        various procedures hitherto adopted; so that Vesquit was not committed
        to the task of acquiring information from Arthwait, which might easily
        have occupied a season; and from these notes the old necromancer came to
        the conclusion that the enemy was to be respected. Gates had done pretty
        well in the matter of the pigeons, at first; his procedure was not to be
        compared with his colleague's
        pedantic idiocies; but the first touch of riposte had been indeed
        deadly. Gates had been the clairvoyant of the party; he had gauged
        clearly enough the result of his operation; but naturally he had left no
        note of the last act, and neither Arthwait nor Abdul Bey had been able
        to do anything. Arthwait had been scared badly until his pompous vanity
        came to the rescue, and showed him that accidents of that kind must be
        expected when one is handicapped with an assistant of inferior ability.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Vesquit decided that the battle should be properly [175]
        prepared, and no trouble spared to make it a success. His fondness for
        corpses had not gone to the length of desiring to become one.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In him there had been the makings of a fairly strong man; and,
        with Douglas to push him on, he was still capable of acting with spirit
        and determination. Also, he had the habit of authority. He set Arthwait
        to worrk on the Grimoire; for, in a operation of this importance, one
        must make all one's instruments.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Beginning with a magic knife, which one is allowed to buy, one
        cuts the magic wand from a hazel, the magic quill from a goose, and so
        on. The idea is to confirm the will to perform the operation by a long
        series of acts <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ad hoc</i>. It is
        even desirable to procure parchment by killing a consecrated animal with
        the magic knife, and making ready the skin with similarly prepared
        utensils; one might for instance, cut and consecrate even the pegs which
        stretched the skin. However, in this case Arthwait had plenty of
        &quot;Virgin parchment&quot; in stock, with quills of a black vulture,
        and ink made by burning human bones, and mixing the carbonized products
        with the soot of the magic dark-lantern, whose candles were prepared
        with human fat.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the Grimoire of any great operation must be thought out and
        composed; according to elaborate rules, indeed, but with the purpose of
        the work constantly in mind. Even when all this is done, the Grimoire is
        hardly begun; for it must be copied out in the way above indicated; and
        it should be illuminated with every kind of appropriate design. This was
        an ideal task for Arthwait; he was able to wallow in dog-latin and
        corrupt Greek-Coptic; he made sentences so complicated that the complete
        works of George Meredith, Thomas Carlyle, and Henry James, tangled
        together, would have seemed in comparison like a word of three letters.
        [176]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His Grimoire was in reality excellent for its purpose; for the
        infernal hierarchy delights in unintelligible images, in every kind of
        confusion and obscurity. This particular lucubration was calculated to
        drag the Archdemon of Bad Syntax himself from the most remote corner of
        his lair. 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For Arthwait could not speak with becoming unintelligibility; to
        knot a sentence up properly it has to be thought
        out carefully, and revised. New phrases have to be put in; sudden
        changes of subject must be introduced; verbs must be shifted to
        unsuspected localities; short words must be excised with ruthless hand;
        archaisms must be sprinkled like sugar-plums upon the concoction; the
        fatal human tendency to say things straightforwardly must be detected
        and defeated by adroit reversals; and, if a glimmer of meaning yet
        remain under close scrutiny, it must be removed by replacing all the
        principal verbs by paraphrases in some dead language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is not to be achieved in a moment; it is not enough to write
        disconnected nonsense; it must be possible for anyone acquainted with
        the tortuosities of the author's mind to resolve the sentence into its
        elements, and reproduce -- not the meaning, for there is none, but the
        same mental fog from which he was originally suffering. An illustration
        is appended.

        Upon this skeleton, a fair example of his earlier manner, for no
        man attains the summit of an art in a day, he would build a
        superstructure by the deft introduction of parentheses, amplifying each
        word until the original coherence of the paragraph was diluted to such
        an extent that the true trail was undiscoverable. The effect upon his
        public was to impress them with the universality of his learning.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arthwait being thus well out of harm's way, Vesquit and Abdul set
        to work on the less arduous of the preparations. Four black cats were
        needed for the four points of the compass, and it was desirable to
        massacre a goat upon the altar, which would be no less than the corpse
        itself. Vesquit, declaring that the body was to be sent to England, had
        a dummy shipped off in a coffin, and kept Gates on ice, which may or may
        not have been a great comfort
        to him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abdul had no difficulty in procuring the cats which, much to
        their dissatisfaction, were caged in Arthwait's study, and fed on human
        flesh, which Vesquit easily procured from the dissecting-rooms of the
        local hospitals.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the goat was a more serious matter. An ordinary goat will not
        do; it had to qualify in certain respects; Abdul succeeded in his quest
        only after a series of intrigues with the lowest ruffians in Naples,
        which brought him into more vulgar and unpleasant dangers than he had
        contemplated &quot;when he first put that uniform on.&quot; It was,
        however, at least temporarily, a very amusing situation for the goat.
        The requisite bat, which must be fed on a woman's blood, was easily
        arranged for, a courageous country girl offering to accommodate with a
        toe, for a consideration.
        The nails from a suicide's coffin, and the skull of the parricide, were
        of course no trouble; for Vesquit never travelled without these
        household requisites.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There were many other details to arrange; the consideration of a
        proper place for the operation gave rise to much mental labour. It is,
        generally speaking, desirable to choose the locality of a recent battle;
        and the greater the number of slain the better. (There should be some
        very desirable spots in the vicinity of Verdun for black magicians who
        happen to flourish after the vulgar year 1917). But the Grimoires were
        written in other times with other manners; now-a-days there is risk of
        disturbance if one sets up one's paraphernalia of goats and cats at a
        cross-roads, in the hope of helping oneself out with a recently-interred
        suicide, or a ceremonially annihilated vampire; where the peasant of the
        fourteenth century would have fled shrieking, the motorist of the
        twentieth century stops to observe, or, more likely, runs you over; so
        that unless your property includes a private battlefield, it is a point
        of valour to choose a more retired site for one's necromancy than the
        stricken field of the Marne. Cross-roads, again, are not so thickly
        planted with suicides and vampires as in happier days. Reflecting
        solidly and ably upon these points of modern degeneracy, Vesquit made up
        his mind to compromise, and accept the most agreeable substitute, a
        profaned chapel; it was easy to rent a villa with a chapel attached,
        and, to a man of Vesquit's ability, the work of a moment to profane it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This he accordingly arranged through Abdul Bey.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The mind of this youth was very forcibly impressed by the
        preparations of the old coroner. He had been brought up in the modern
        school, and could laugh at superstition with the best of us; but there
        were traces of hereditary faith in Islam, and he was not sceptical
        enough to spoil the magic of Vesquit.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        No man knew better than the necromancer that all this insane
        ceremonial was irrational. But it [179] so happens that everything on
        this planet is, ultimately, irrational; there is not, and cannot be, any
        reason for the causal connexion of things, if only because our use of
        the word &quot;reason&quot; already implies the idea of causal
        connexion. But, even if we avoid this fundamental difficulty, Hume said
        that causal connexion was not merely unprovable, but unthinkable; and,
        in shallower waters still, one cannot assign a true reason why water
        should flow down hill, or sugar taste sweet in the mouth. Attempts to
        explain these simple matters always progress into a learned lucidity,
        and on further analysis retire to a remote stronghold where every thing
        is irrational and unthinkable.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If you cut off a man's head, he dies. Why? Because it kills him.
        That is really the whole answer. Learned excursions into anatomy and
        physiology only beg the question; it does not explain why the heart is
        necessary to life to say that it is a vital organ. Yet that is exactly
        what is done, the trick that is played on every inquiring mind. Why
        cannot I see in the dark? Because light is necessary to sight. No
        confusion of that issue by talk of rods and cones, and optical centres,
        and foci, and lenses, and vibrations is very different to Edwin
        Arthwait's treatment of the long-suffering English language.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Knowledge is really confined to experience. The laws of Nature
        are, as Kant said, the laws of our minds, and, as Huxley said, the
        generalization of observed facts.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is, therefore, no argument against ceremonial magic to say
        that it is &quot;absurd&quot; to try to raise a thunderstorm by beating
        a drum; it is not even fair to say that you have tried the experiment,
        found it would not work, and so perceived it to be
        &quot;impossible.&quot; You might as well claim that, as you had taken
        paint and canvas, and not produced a Rembrandt, it was evident that the
        pictures attributed to his painting were really produced in quite a
        different way.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        You do not see why the skull of a parricide should help you to
        raise a dead man, as you do not see why the mercury in a thermometer
        should rise and fall, though you elaborately pretend that you do; and
        you could not raise a dead man by the aid of the skull of a parricide,
        just as you could not play the violin like Kreisler; though in the
        latter case you might modestly add that you thought you could learn.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is not the special pleading of a professed magician; it
        boils down to the advice not to judge subjects of which you are
        perfectly ignorant, and is to be found, stated in clearer and lovelier
        language, in the Essays of Thomas Henry Huxley.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Dr. Victor Vesquit, to whom the whole of these ideas was
        perfectly familiar, proceeded with his quaint preparations unperturbed
        by the least doubt of their efficacy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He had found that they worked; and he cared no more for the
        opinion of those who, whatever their knowledge in other branches of
        science might be, were not experts in necromancy, than does Harry Vardon
        when it is proved to him, with the utmost scientific precision, that he
        cannot possibly hit a golf ball so long as he swings as he does, and
        uses that mechanically defective grip.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is also to be remarked that the contrary holds good; no method
        of doing anything has yet been found which cannot be bungled by the
        inept.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So, as the Persian poet says: &quot;Who hath the How is careless
        of the Why.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was early in the course of Dr. Vesquit's preliminaries that
        (what Arthwait called the &quot;antilan-thanetical douleskeiarchy&quot;)
        the secret service which had been established reported to him a complete
        [181] change in the routine of the people of the Butterfly net. On the
        seventh of January Iliel reported that the first point of the work was
        in all probability attained; all that was now necessary was to
        concentrate upon the real crux of the case, the catching of the
        Butterfly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The household was reorganized accordingly; Cyril Grey withdrew
        himself completely from the company of Iliel, and joined the Church
        Militant Here On Earth; while Iliel herself came under the direct care
        of Sister Clara, the point within the triangle of women. She took part
        in their invocations, as the focus to which they were directed; while
        the men were wholly busied in watching over the safety of the fortress,
        their faces turned inexorably outward, their sole business to assure the
        security of the three women and their treasure.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Upon these facts being brought to the notice of Edwin Arthwait,
        he smiled. He had redeemed his earlier failures -- due to the incapacity
        of his assistants -- by a sweeping success.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For to his magic, evidently, was due the observed change in
        nature! Shortly after the arrival of Vesquit, he had completed his
        latest operation, the bewitchment of three nails in such a manner that,
        if struck into the door of a room of a house, the occupants would be
        thereby debarred from the enjoyment of conjugal felicity. And here was
        the result, shining before him, beautiful with banners. Even the
        pretence of amity had been abandoned. As a matter of fact, Brother
        Onofrio had discovered the nails, and taken the proper measures to
        return the current to its sender; but on this occasion it was as &quot;
        tae tak' the breeks aff a Hielan' mon&quot;!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arthwait was totally insensible to the malice of his adversary,
        and remained in the enjoyment of his supposed victory. He resolved to
        steal a match on [182] Vesquit. Why should he share his glory with
        another? He had the enemy on the run; he had better pursue them
        forthwith. Vesquit's slow methods would only give them time to recover.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So he resolved upon the chivalrous if perilous course of Cat's
        Cradle. This magical operation, the relics of which are familiar even to
        the most unspiritually-minded children, is exceedingly widespread,
        especially among nations which live principally by fishing, as, for
        example, the South Sea Islanders. Many most intricate and beautiful
        patterns have been devised, and of these the wayfaring man may partake
        by a perusal of Dr. W. W. R.
        Ball's monograph upon the subject.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</a>
        That able mathematician, however, neglects unpardonably the magical side
        of the matter.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The theory is apparently based upon the fact that the most
        elusive objects, birds, butterflies, and fishes, may be taken by means
        of a net. It is argued, therefore, that anything whatever, no matter how
        elusive, such as the ghost of one's father or the soul of one's enemy,
        may be caught similarly, though of course the net must be adapted to the
        special game that one is after.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With these things Arthwait was familiar, and it occurred to him
        that it should be easy to identify string, or, preferably, cat-gut, with
        the viscera of his victims. There could then be no difficulty in
        knotting up the cords in such a pattern, for example, as the Many Stars,
        or the Owl, or the Zigzag Lightning; and assuredly the magicians thus
        assailed would find similar re-arrangements of the contents of their
        peritonea.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After various preliminary exercises, annoying to the objects of
        this solicitude, Arthwait proposed to proceed to the grand operation of
        all, tying up his gut in the Elusive Yam pattern, which, from the [183]
        greatest complexity, dissolves like a dream at a single last twist; the
        persons thus sympathetically treated would obviously perish no less
        miserably than did Eglon, King of Moab, or Judas Iscariot.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The advantage of this operation is evidently its extreme
        simplicity and economy; while, if it works at all, it surely leaves
        nothing to be desired in such Teutonic qualities as thoroughness and
        frightfulness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Whether from any difficulty in identification or otherwise, it
        was some little while before Arthwait began to feel that his plan was
        working out. The trouble with all these operations was in the absence of
        a direct link with the principals; the currents invariably struck the
        outer defences, in the person of Brother Onofrio, before penetrating.
        When, therefore, Arthwait's efforts began to show results, they were
        first noticed by that sturdy warrior.
        And he, considering the situation, argued that the observed phenomena
        were due to Nature or to Magick, and that in either case the remedy lay
        in opposing no resistance to the forces, but allowing them to operate in
        a laudable manner. Accordingly, he took a large dose of a medicine known
        to the pharmacist as Hydrarg.Subchlor, adding the remark &quot;If this
        be nature, may it do <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">me</i> good;
        and if this be magic, may it do <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">him</i>
        good!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This occurred just as Arthwait reached his final operation, the
        evisceration of his enemy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        That night both parties were successful in causing things to
        happen; and the morning after Arthwait was securely incarcerated in the
        Quarantine Hospital of the city, and the newspapers were paragraphing a
        suspected case of Asiatic Cholera.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        However, in five days the symptoms abated; the case was declared
        non-infectious; and the pallid shadow of the disconcerted sorcerer was
        restored to the more congenial atmosphere of his Grimoire. [184]
