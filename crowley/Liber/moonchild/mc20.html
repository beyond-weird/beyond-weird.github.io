        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        THE spring in Naples had advanced with eager foot; in her gait
        she revealed the truth of her godhead; and by the end of April there was
        no wreath of snow on Apennine, or Alban, or Apulian Hill.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The last day of the month was hot and still as midsummer; the
        slopes of Posillippo begged a breath from Ocean, and were denied. So
        heavy a haze hung on the sea that not only Capri, not only the blue spur
        that stabs the sunset, but Vesuvius itself, were hidden from the Villa
        where Iliel and her friends were nested.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sunset was sombre and splendid; the disc itself was but a vague
        intensity of angry Indian red. His agony spilt a murky saffron through
        the haze; and the edges of the storm-clouds on the horizon,
        fantastically shapen, cast up a veritable mirage, exaggerated and
        distorted images of their own scarred crests, that shifted and changed,
        so that one might have sworn that monsters -- dragons, hippogriffs,
        chimaerae -- were moving in the mist, a saturnalia of phantasms.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel impatiently awaited the moment of darkness, when she could
        meet the Old Lady and start for the Sabbath. She had noticed a long
        conference that day between Sister Clara and the two men; and she was
        sure that they were themselves arranging for their departure. The
        suspicion was confirmed when, one after the other,
        they came to wish her a good night. [277] She was more than ever
        determined to follow them to the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        By nine o'clock everything was still in the garden, save for the
        tread of Brother Onofrio's patrol, who paced the upper terrace, chanting
        in the soft and low, yet stern, tones of his well-modulated voice, the
        exorcism that magical guardians have sung for so many ages, with its
        refrain: &quot;On them will I impose my will, the Law of Light.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel gave her little cough, and found herself immediately upon
        the path she knew so well. It only took her a few minutes to reach the
        rock, and there was the Old Lady waiting for her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I must tell you at once, my dear,&quot; she began without
        any preliminary, &quot;that you must be very careful to do exactly as I
        say -- in that country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was the same sing-song, with the one change of word.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;First of all, you must never speak of anything by its name
        -- in that country. So, if you see a tree on a mountain, it will be
        better to say 'Look at the green on the high'; for that's how they talk
        -- in that country. And whatever you do, you must find a false reason
        for doing it -- in that country. If you rob a man, you must say it is to
        help and protect him: that's the ethics -- of that country. And
        everything of value has no value at all -- in that country. You must be
        perfectly commonplace if you want to be a genius -- in that country. And
        everything you like you must pretend not to like; and anything that is
        there you must pretend is not there -- in that country. And you must
        always say that you are sacrificing yourself in the cause of religion,
        and morality, and humanity, and liberty, and progress, when you want to
        cheat your neighbour -- in that country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Iliel, &quot;are we going to
        England?&quot; [278]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They call the place Stonehenge -- in that country.&quot;
        And without another word the Old Lady dragged Iliel into the cleft of
        the rock. It was very, very dark inside, and she tripped over loose
        stones. Then the Old Lady opened a little door, and she found herself
        standing on a narrow window-ledge. The door shut fast behind her, almost
        pushing her out. Beyond the ledge was nothing but the Abyss of Stars.
        She was seized with an enormous vertigo. She would have fallen into that
        cruel emptiness, but the Old Lady's voice came: &quot;What I said
        outside was nonsense, just to put the Gwalkins off the trail, my dear;
        there is only one rule, and that is to take things as they come -- in
        this country.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She pushed Iliel deliberately from the window-sill; with a scream
        she flew through the blackness. But the chubby little old clergyman
        explained to her that she must go into the castle on the islet. It was
        only a little way to walk over the ice of the lake, but there was no
        sign of an entrance. The castle was fitted cunningly to the
        irregularities of the rock, so that one could see nothing but the
        masonry; and there was no trace of any door, and
        the windows were all very high in the wall. But as Iliel came to it she
        found herself inside, and she never knew how she got there. It was easy
        to scramble along the ladder to the golf course, but the main deck of
        the galleon was slippery with the oil that spurted from its thousand
        fountains. However, she came at last to the wardrobe where her hairbrush
        was hanging, and she lost no time in digging for the necessary skylarks.
        At last the way
        was clear! The pine-woods on the left; the ant-hills on the right;
        straight through the surf to the heathery pagoda where the chubby
        clergyman and the Old Lady had already arrived, and were busy
        worshipping the Chinese God.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Of course! It was Cyril, with Brother Onofrio [279] and Sister
        Clara all the time -- how stupid she had been!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But for all that the toads were a nuisance with their eternal
        chatter and laughter; and they wore their jewels much too conspicuously
        and profusely.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then she perceived that Cyril and his two companions formed
        but one triangle, out of uncounted thousands; and each triangle was at a
        knot upon the web of an enormous spider. At each knot was such a group
        of three, and every one was different. There must have been millions of
        such gods, each with its pair of worshippers; every race and clime and
        period was represented. There were the gods of Mexico and of Peru, of
        Syria and Babylon, of Greece and Rome, of obscure swamps of Ethiopia, of
        deserts and mountains. And upon each thread of the web, from knot to
        knot, danced incredible insects, and strange animals, and hideous
        reptiles. They danced, sang, and whirled frantically, so that the entire
        web was a mere bewilderment of motion. Her head swam dizzily. But she
        was now full of a curious anger; her thought was that the Old Lady had
        betrayed her. She found it quite impossible to approach the triangle,
        for one thing: she was furious that it should be Sister Clara herself
        who had led her into this Sabbath, for another; and she was infinitely
        disgusted at the whole vile revel. Now she noticed that each pair of
        worshippers had newborn children in their arms; and they offered these
        to their god, who threw them instantly towards the centre of the web.
        Following up those cruel meshes, she beheld the
        spider itself, with its six legs. Its head and body formed one black
        sphere, covered with moving eyes that darted rays of darkness in every
        direction, and mouths that sucked up its prey without remorse or
        cessation, and cast it out once more in the form of fresh strands of
        that vibrating web. [280]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel shuddered with the horror of the vision; it was to her a
        dread unspeakable, yet she was hypnotized and helpless. She felt in
        herself that one day she too must become the prey of that most dire and
        demoniac power of darkness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As she gazed, she saw that even the gods and their worshippers
        were morsels for its mouths. Ever and anon she beheld one of the legs
        crooked round a triangle and draw it, god, shrine, and worshippers, into
        the blackness of the spider's bloated belly. Then they were thrown out
        violently again, in some slightly altered form, to repeat the same
        uncanny ritual.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With a strong shudder she broke away from that infernal&nbsp;
        contemplation. Where was the kindly earth, with all its light and&nbsp;
        beauty? In God's name, why had she left Lavinia King to explore
        these dreadful realms -- of illusion? of imagination? of darker and
        deadlier reality than life? It mattered little which; the one thing
        needful was to turn again to humanity, to the simple sensible life that
        she had always lived. It was not noble, not wonderful; but it was better
        than this nightmare of phantoms, cruel and malignant and hideous, this
        phantasmagoria of damnation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She wrenched herself away; for a moment she lost consciousness
        completely; then she found herself in her bed at the Villa. With
        feverish energy she sprang from the couch, and ran to the wardrobe to
        put on her travelling dress. It would be easy to drop from the wall of
        the terrace into the lane; in an hour she would be safe in Naples. And
        then she discovered that the dress would have to be altered before she
        could wear it. With vehemence she set instantly to work -- and just as
        she was finishing, the door opened, and Sister Clara stood beside her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Come, Iliel,&quot; she said, &quot;it is the moment to
        salute May Morn!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The indignant girl recoiled in anger and disgust; [281] but
        Sister Clara stood smiling gently and tenderly. Iliel looked at her,
        almost despite herself; and she could not but see the radiance of her
        whole being, a physical aura of light playing about her, and the fire of
        her eyes transcendent with seraph happiness.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They are waiting for us in the garden,&quot; she said,
        taking Iliel by the arm, like a nurse with an invalid. And she drew over
        her shoulders the great lunar mantle of blue velvet with its broidered
        silver crescents, its talismans of the moon, and its heavy hanging
        tassels of seed pearls; and upon her head she set the tiara of
        moon-stones.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Come, they are waiting.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So Iliel suffered herself to be led once more into the garden. In
        the east the first rays of the sun gilded the crest of Posilippo, and
        tinged the pale blue of the firmament with rosy fingers. The whole
        company was gathered together, an ordered phalanx, to salute the Lord of
        Life and Light.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel could not join in that choir of adoration. In her heart was
        blackness and hate, and nausea in her mouth. What vileness lay beneath
        this fair semblance! Well, let it be; she would be gone.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril came to her with Brother Onofrio, as the last movement of
        their majestic chant died away upon the echoing air. He took her in his
        arms. &quot;Come! I have much to tell you.&quot; He led her to a marble
        seat, and made her sit down. Brother Onofrio and Sister Clara followed
        them, and sat upon the base of a great statue, a copy of the Marsyas and
        Olympas in green bronze, hard by.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Child!&quot; said Cyril, very gravely and gently,
        &quot;look at the eastern slope of Posilippo! And look at the stars, how
        brightly they shine! And look at that shoal of gleaming fish, that swim
        so deep beneath the waters of the bay! And look at your left ear! What
        shapeliness! What delicate pink!&quot; [282]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was too angry even to tell him not to be an idiot. She only
        smiled disdainfully.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He continued. &quot;But those things are there. You cannot see
        them because the conditions are not right. But there are other things
        that your eye sees indeed, but you, not; because you have not been
        trained to see them for what they are. See Capri in the morning sun! How
        do you know it is an island, not a dream, or a cloud, or a sea-monster?
        Only by comparison with previous knowledge and experience. You can only
        see things that are already
        in your own mind -- or things so like them that you can adjust yourself
        to the small percentage of difference. But you cannot observe or
        apprehend things that are utterly unfamiliar except by training and
        experience. How does the alphabet look to you when you first learn it?
        Don't you confuse the letters?&nbsp; Arabic
        looks 'fantastic' to you, as the Roman script does to the Arab; you can
        memorize one at a glance, white you plod painfully over the other,
        letter by letter, and probably copy it wrong after all. That's what
        happened to you last night. I know you were there; and, knowing you were
        not an initiate, I can guess pretty well what you must have seen. You
        saw things 'accurately,' so far as you could see them; that is, you saw
        a projection into your own mind of something really in being. How right
        such vision can be, and yet how wrong! Watch my hand!&quot; He suddenly
        raised his right hand. With the other he held a book between it and her
        eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I can't see it!&quot; she cried petulantly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look at its shadow on the wall!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's the head of the devil!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yet I am only making the gesture of benediction.&quot; He
        lowered the book. She recognized at once the correctness of his
        statement. [283]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She looked at him with open mouth and eyes. He was always
        stupefying her by the picturesqueness of his allegories, and his trick
        of presenting them dramatically.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;What then?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This is what really happened last night -- only there's no
        such thing as time. This is what you should have seen, and what you will
        see one day, if you cling to the highest in you.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He drew a note-book of white vellum from his pocket, and began to
        read.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The whirlwind of the Eagle and the Lion!

        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Before that Rod Heaven knows itself unjust;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Beneath those hoofs the stars are puffs of dust.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Rise up, my soul! One stride, and space is spanned;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Time, like a poppy, crushed in thy left hand,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        While with thy right thou reachest out to grip
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Graal of God, and tilt it to thy lip?

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lo! all the whirring shafts of Light, a web
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Wherein the Tides of Being flow and ebb,

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        One heart-beat, pulsing the Eternal stress,

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Light thrills through Light, the spindle of desire,

        Life circles Life, the Rose all flowers above,

        Lo! on each spear of Splendour burns a world
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Star-clustered dew each fibre of that light

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Nothing so small, so base, so incomplete,

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Each comprehensive of its single soul

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Each one made perfect in its passionate part,

        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Always the Three in One are interwoven,

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        By That which, comprehending in one whole

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The universal rapture of Its soul,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Abides beyond Its own illumination,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Withdrawn from Its imperishable station,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Upholding all, an arm whose falchion flings
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With every flash a new-fledged Soul of Things;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Beholding all, with eyes whose flashes flood
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The veins of their own universe with blood;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Absorbing all, each myriad mouth aflame

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To utter the unutterable Name

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;That calls all souls, the greatest and the least,

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To the unimaginable marriage-feast;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And, in the self-same sacrament, is stirred
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To recreate their essence with a Word;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This All, this Sire and Lord of All, abides
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Behind the unbounded torrent of Its tides, [285]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In silence of all deed, or word, or thought,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So that we name It not, or name It Naught.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is the Truth behind the lie called God;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This blots the heavens, and indwells the clod.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This is the centre of all spheres, the flame
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In men and stars, the Soul behind the name,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The spring of Life, the axle of the Wheel,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All-mover, yet the One Thing immobile.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Adore It not, for It adoreth thee,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The shadow-shape of Its eternity.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lift up thyself! be strong to burst thy bars!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For lo! thy stature shall surpass the stars.&quot;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril put away his book. &quot;Language,&quot; said he, &quot;has
        been developed from its most primitive sources by persons so
        passionately concentrated upon the Ideal of selling cheese without
        verbal infelicity that some other points have necessarily been
        neglected. One cannot put mystic experience into words. One can at best
        describe phenomena with a sort of cold and wooden accuracy, or suggest
        ecstasy by very vagueness. You know that line 'O windy star blown
        sideways up the sky!' It means nothing, if you analyse it; but it gives
        the idea of something, though one could never say what. What you saw, my
        beloved Iliel, bears about the same ratio to what I have said as what I
        have said does to what Sister Clara saw: or, rather, was. Moral: when
        Sister turns we all turn. I have now apologized, though inadequately,
        for inflicting my bad verses upon you; which will conclude the
        entertainment for this morning. Brother Onofrio will now take up the
        collection. He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord; details
        of rate of interest and security on application to the bartender. The
        liberal soul shall be made fat; but I am Banting, as the hart banteth
        after the water brooks. He that watereth shall be watered also himself:
        I will take a cold shower before the plunge. The Mother's Meeting will
        be held as usual at 8.30 on Thursday [286] evening. Those who are not
        yet Mothers, but who wish to become so, kindly apply to me in the Vestry
        at the conclusion of the service. Sister Clara, please play the people
        out quickly!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril babbled out this nonsense in the tones of the Sweet Young
        Thing type of Curate; it was his way of restoring the superficial
        atmosphere.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel took his arm, and went smiling to breakfast; but her soul
        was yet ill at ease. She asked him about the identification of Sister
        Clara and her Old Lady.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it was best to have her on the
        watch outside -- on the Astral Plane -- to keep you from getting into
        too great mischief. But you can never come to any real harm so long as
        you keep your vow and stay inside the circle. That's the one important
        point.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was quite satisfied in her upper conscious self, which was
        usually her better self, because of its rationality, and its advantage
        of surface training, which saved her from obeying her impulses on every
        occasion. She was glad, she was proud, of her partnership with the
        adepts. Yet there was a subconscious weakness in her which hated them
        and envied them the more because of their superiority to her. She knew
        only too well that the price
        of their attainment had been the suppression of just such darknesses of
        animal instinct and savage superstition as were her chief delight. The
        poet speaks of &quot;the infinite rage of fishes to have wings&quot;;
        but when you explain to the fish that it will have to give up pumping
        water through its gills, it is apt to compromise for a few million
        generations; though the word may rankle if you call it a flying-fish,
        when swimming-bird is evidently
        a properer and politer name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was permanently annoyed with Sister Clara; her motive for
        making excursions on that path had [287] been to get rid of the idea of
        Cyril and his magick; and he had not even come himself to welcome her,
        but set this woman to disguise herself and spy upon her thoughts! It was
        disgusting.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril had certainly done his best to put the matter in the proper
        light. He had even told her a story. &quot;A charming lady, wife of a
        friend of Bowling's, whom her physical and mental characteristics induce
        me to introduce as Mrs. Dough-Nut, was once left lorn in the desert
        island of Manhattan, while her husband was on a spook-shikar with Lord
        Antony in this very Naples, which you see before you. (Slightly to the
        left, child!) Mrs.
        Dough-nut was as virtuous as American women sometimes are, when denied
        opportunity to be otherwise; and the poor lady was far from attractive.
        But in the world of spirits, it appears, the same standards are not
        current as in Peacock Alley or Times Square; and she was soon supplied
        with a regular regiment of 'spirit lovers.' They told her what to do,
        and how to do it; eating, drinking, reading, music, whatever she did,
        all must be done under spirit control; and one day they told her that
        they had a great and wonderful work for her to do -- the regeneration of
        humanity and so forth, I think it was; anyhow, something perfectly
        dotty. She was now quite without power to criticize her actions by
        reason or good sense; the voice of the 'Spirits' was for her the voice
        of God. So they sent her to the Bank for money, and to the Steamship
        office for a passage to Europe; and when she got to Liverpool they sent
        her to London, from London to Paris, from Paris to Genoa. And when she
        came to Genoa they told her which hotel to choose; and then they sent
        her out to buy a revolver and some cartridges; and then they told her to
        cock it and put the muzzle to her forehead; and then to pull the
        trigger. The bullet made little impression on that [288] armour-plate of
        solid bone; and she escaped to tell her story. She had not even sense
        enough to tell it different. But that, my child, is why it is better to
        have a kind friend to look after you when you start a flirtation with
        the gay if treacherous Lotharios of the Astral World.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I hope you don't think I'm a woman like that!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;All women are like that.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She bit her lips; but her good sense showed her that his main
        principle was right. If she had only been able to stifle the formless
        promptings which were so alluring and so dangerous! But as she could not
        live wholly on the heights of aspiration, so also she could not live on
        the safe plains of earth-life. The voices of the swamp and the cavern
        called to her continuously. 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And so the external reconciliation had no deep root. For a few
        weeks she was better and healthier in body and mind. Then she slipped
        back into her sulks, and went &quot;fairy-tale-ing&quot; as she called
        it, with a very determined mind to be on guard against the interference
        of Sister Clara. She had begun to familiarize herself with the laws of
        this other world, and could distinguish symbols and their meanings to
        some extent; she could even summon certain forms, or banish them. And
        she set a mighty bar between herself and Sister Clara. She kept herself
        to the definite creations
        of her own impulses, would not let herself go except upon some such
        chosen lines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In her earth-life, too, she became more obviously ill-tempered;
        and, as to a woman of her type revenge only means one thing, she amused
        the garrison exceedingly by attempting flirtations. The rule of the
        Profess-House happened to include the virtue of chastity, which is an
        active and positive thing, a passion, not that mere colourless
        abstinence and stagnation which passes in Puritan countries by that
        [289] name, breeds more wickedness than all the vice on the planet, and,
        at the best, is shared by clinkers.

        She was clever enough to see in a few hours that she was only
        making herself utterly ridiculous; but this again did not tend to
        improve her temper, as many devout ladies, from Dido to Potiphar's wife,
        have been at the pains to indicate to our psychologists.

        The situation grew daily more strained, with now and then an
        explosion which cleared the air for a while. The discipline of the
        Profess-House prevented the trouble from spreading; but Cyril Grey
        confided to Brother Onofrio that he was angrier than ever at the
        efficient way in which Edwin Arthwait and his merry men had been put out
        of business.

        &quot;I'd give my ears,&quot; said Cyril, &quot;to see Edwin, arm
        in arm with Lucifuge Rofocale, coming up from the bay to destroy us all
        by means of the Mysterious Amulet of Rabbi Solomon, conferring health,
        wealth and happiness, with bag complete; also lucky moles and
        love-charms, price two eleven three to regular subscribers to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

        But with June a great and happy change came over Iliel. She
        became enthralled by the prospect of the miracle that was so soon to
        blossom on her breast. Her sulkiness vanished; she was blithe and joyous
        from the day's beginning to its end. She bore fatigue and discomfort
        without a murmur. She made friends with Sister Clara, and talked to her
        for hours while she plied her needle upon those necessary and now
        delightful tasks of making tiny and dainty settings for the expected
        jewel. She clean forgot the irksomeness of her few restrictions; she
        recovered all the gaiety and buoyancy of youth; indeed, she had to be
        cautioned in the mere physical matter of activity. No longer did she
        indulge morbid fancies, or take unwholesome pleasure in the
        contemplation of
        evil ideas. She was at home in her heaven of romance, [290] the heroine
        of the most wonderful story in the world. Her love for Cyril showed a
        tender and more exalted phase; she became alive to her dignity and
        responsibility. She acquired also a sense of Nature which she had never
        had before in all her life; she felt a brotherhood with every leaf and
        flower of the garden, told herself stories of the loves of the fishermen
        whose sails dotted the blue of the bay, wondered what romances were
        dancing on the decks of the great white liners that steamed in from
        America to tour the Mediterranean, laughed with joy over the antics of
        the children who played on the slopes below the garden, and glowed with
        the vigour of the sturdy peasants who bore their baskets of fish, or
        flowers, or their bundles of firewood, up or down the lanes which her
        terraces overlooked. There was one wrinkled fish- wife
        who was perfectly delightful: old and worn with a lifetime of toil, she
        was as cheerful as the day was long; bowed down as she was by her
        glittering burden, she never failed to stop and wave a hand, and cry
        &quot;God bless you, pretty lady, and send you safe and happy day!&quot;
        with the frank warmth of the Italian peasant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The world was a fine place, after all, and Cyril Grey was the
        dearest boy in it, and herself the happiest woman. [291]
