        DR. VESQUIT AND HIS COMPANIONS, HOW THEY FARED
        IN THEIR WORK OF NECROMANCY; AND OF A COUNCIL
        OF WAR OF CYRIL GREY AND BROTHER ONOFRIO;
        WITH CERTAIN OPINIONS OF THE FORMER UPON
        THE ART OF MAGICK.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        THE Neapolitan winter had overpassed its common clemency; save
        for a touch of frost, kindly and wholesome, on a few nights, it had no
        frown or rigour. Day after day the sun had enkindled the still air, and
        life had danced with love upon the hills.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But on the night of her fullness, the moon was tawny and obscure,
        with a reddish vapour about her, as if she had wrapped herself in a
        mantle of anger; and the next dawn broke grey with storm, the wind
        tearing its way across the mountain spine of Italy, as if some horde of
        demon bandits were raiding the peasantry of the plains. The
        Butterfly-Net was sheltered from its rage by the crest of Posilippo; but
        it was bitter cold in the house, and Iliel bade her maidens pile the
        brazier with hazel and white sandalwood and birch.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Across the ridge, the villa which Dr. Vesquit had taken for the
        winter was exposed to the senseless madness of the blast; and he too
        heaped his braziers, but with cypress and bituminous coal.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As the day passed the violence of the storm increased; the doctor
        even began to fear for the safety of his operation when, about an hour
        after noon, [201] a window of the villa was broken by a torn branch of
        olive that came hurtling against it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But a little later the speed of the hurricane abated; the sky was
        visible, through the earth-vapours, as a wrack of wrathful clouds -- one
        might say the flight of Michael before Satan.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Though the gale was yet fierce, its heart broke in a torrent of
        sleet mixed with hail; for two hours more it drove almost horizontally
        against the hillside, and then, steadying and steepening, fell as a
        flood, a cataract of icy rain.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The slopes of Posilippo roared with their foaming load; gardens
        were washed clear of soil; walls broke down before the impetuosity of
        the waves they strove to dam; and the streets of lower Naples stood in
        water to the height of a man's thigh.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The hour for the beginning of the work of the necromancers was
        that of sunset; and at that moment the rain, after a last burst of
        vehemence, ceased entirely; nightfall, though black and bitter, was
        silent as the corpse of Gates itself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the chapel a portion of the marble floor had been torn up; for
        it was desired to touch the naked earth with the bare feet, and draw her
        powers directly up from their volcanic stratum.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This raw earth had been smeared with mire brought from the swamps
        of the Maremma; and upon this sulphur had been sprinkled until it formed
        a thick layer. In this sulphur the magick circle had been drawn with a
        two-pointed stick, and the grooves thus made had been filled with
        charcoal powder.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was not a true circle; no figure of sanctity and perfection
        might enter into that accursed rite; it had been made somewhat in the
        shape of an old-fashioned keyhole, a combination of circle and
        triangle.[202]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the centre the body of Gates, his head toward the north, was
        laid; Arthwait stood on one side with the Grimoire in one hand, and a
        lighted taper of black wax in the other. On the opposite side was Abdul
        Bey, holding the goat in leash, and bearing the sickle which Vesquit was
        to use as the principal magical weapon of the ceremony.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The doctor was himself the last to enter the circle. In a basket
        he had the four black cats; and, when he had lighted the nine small
        candles about the circle, he pinned the four cats, at the four quarters,
        with black arrows of iron. He was careful not to kill them; it was
        important that their agony should frighten away any undesirable spirits.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        All being now ready, the necromancers fell upon their knees; for
        this servile position is pleasing to the enemies of mankind.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The forces which made man, alone of all animals, erect, love to
        see him thank Them for that independence by refusing to surrender it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The main plan of Dr. Vesquit's ceremony was simple; it was to
        invoke the spirit of a demon into the goat, and slaying the animal at
        that moment of possession upon the corpse of Gates, to endow that corpse
        with the demoniac power, in a kind of hideous marriage.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The object was then identical with that of spiritism, or
        &quot;spiritualism,&quot; as it is commonly and illiterately called; but
        Dr. Vesquit was a serious student, determined to obtain results, and not
        to be duped; his methods were consequently more efficient than those of
        the common or parlour medium.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arthwait opened the Grimoire and began his conjurations. It would
        be impossible to reproduce the hideous confusion and complexity of the
        manner, and undesirable to indicate the abomination of the matter. But
        every name of opposition to light was [203] invoked in its own rite; the
        fearful deities of man's dawn, when nature was supposed to be a personal
        power of cruelty, delighting in murder, rape, and pillage, were called
        by their most secret names, and commemoration made of their deeds of
        infamy.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Such was the recital of horror that, cloaked even as it was in
        Arthwait's unintelligible style, the meaning was salient by virtue of
        the tone of the enchanter, and the gestures with which Vesquit
        accompanied him, going in dumb show through all the gamut of infernal
        discord, the music of the pit. He showed how children were cast into the
        fire, or thrown to bears, or offered up in sacrifice on bloody altars;
        how peaceful nations were uprooted by savage tribes in the name of their
        demon, their men slain or mutilated and enslaved, their women butchered,
        their virgins ravished; how miracle testified to the power of the evil
        ones, the earth opening to swallow heretic priests, the sun stopped in
        the sky that the hours of massacre might be prolonged.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was in short one interminable recital of treachery and murder
        and revenge; never a thought of pity or of kindliness, of common decency
        or common humanity, struck a false note in that record of vileness; and
        it culminated in the ghastliest atrocity of human history, when the one
        man in all that cut-throat race who now and then showed gleams of a
        nobler mind was chosen for torture and death as a final offering to the
        blood-lust
        of the fiend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With a sort of hellish laughter, the second conjuration continued
        the recital; how the demon had brought the corpse of his victim to life,
        and mocked and profaned his humanity by concealing himself in that
        man-shape, thence to continue his reign, and extend his empire, under
        the cloak of hypocrisy. The crimes that had been done openly in the
        fiend's name, were now to be carried on with fresh device [204] of shame
        and horror, by those who called themselves the priests of his victim.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        By this commemoration was concluded the first part of the
        ceremony; the atmosphere of the fiend, so to speak, was brought into the
        circle; in the second part the demon was to be identified with the goat;
        in the third part the two first were joined, and the goat as he died was
        to repeat the miracle wrought in long ages past upon that other victim,
        by coming to life again humanized by the contact of the ghost of the
        sorcerer.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is not permissible to describe this ritual in detail; it is
        too execrably efficient; but the Turk, brought up in a merciful
        and cleanly religion, with but few stains of savagery upon it, faltered
        and nigh fainted; only his desire for Lisa, which had become a
        soul-tempest, held him to the circle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And indeed the brains of them all were awhirl. As Eliphaz Levi
        says, evil ceremonies are a true intellectual poison; they do invoke the
        powers of hallucination and madness as surely as does hashish. And who
        dare call the phantoms of delirium &quot;unreal?&quot; They are real
        enough to kill a man, to ruin a life, to push a soul to every kind of
        crime; and there are not many &quot;real&quot; &quot;material&quot;
        things that have such weight in work.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Phantoms, then, were apparent to the necromancers; and there was
        no doubt in any of their minds that they were dealing with actual and
        malignant entities.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The hideous cries of the tortured cats mingled with the
        triumphant bleating of the goat and the nasal monotone of Arthwait as he
        mouthed the words of the Grimoire. And it seemed to all of them as
        though the air grew thick and greasy; that of that slime were bred
        innumerable creeping things, monsters misshapen, abortions of dead paths
        of evolution, [205] creatures which had not been found fit to live upon
        the earth and so had been cast off by her as excrement. It seemed as if
        the goat were conscious of the phantoms; as if he understood himself as
        demon-king of those regions; for he bounded under the manipulations of
        Vesquit with such rage and pride that Abdul Bey was forced to use all
        his strength hold him. It was taken as a sign of success by all the
        necromancers; and as Vesquit made the final gesture, Arthwait turned his
        page, and Abdul struck home with a great knife to the brute's heart.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now, as the blood stained their grave-clothes, the hearts of the
        three sorcerers beat heavily. A foul sweat broke out upon them. The
        sudden change -- psychological or magical? -- from the turgid drone of
        Arthwait to the grimness of that silence in which the howls of the
        agonizing cats rose hideous, struck them with a deadly fear. Or was it
        that they realized for the first time on what a ship they had embarked?
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suppose the corpse did move? Suppose Gates rose in the power of
        the devil, and strangled them? Their sweat ran down, and mingled with
        the blood. The stench of the slain goat was horrible, and the body of
        Gates had begun decomposition. The sulphur, burning in little patches
        here and there, where a candle had fallen and kindled it, added the reek
        of hell to that of death. Abdul Bey of a sudden was taken deathly sick;
        at the end he
        pitched forward, prone upon the corpses. Vesquit pulled him roughly
        back, and administered a violent stimulant, which made him master of
        himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Now Arthwait started the final conjuration. It can hardly be
        called language; it was like the jabber of a monkey-house, and like the
        yells of a thousand savages, and like the moaning of damned souls.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Meanwhile Vesquit proceeded to the last stage of his task. With
        his knife he hacked off the goat's head, [206] and thrust it into a
        cavity slashed in the abdomen of the other body. Other parts of the goat
        he thrust into the mouth of Gates, while the obscene clamour of the cats
        mingled with the maniac howls of his colleague.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And then the one thing happened which they none of them expected.
        Abdul Bey flung himself down upon the carcasses, and began to tear them
        with his teeth, and lap the blood with his tongue. Arthwait shrieked out
        in terror that the Turk had gone mad: but Vesquit understood the truth.
        Abdul was the most sensitive of the party, and the least developed; it
        was in him that the spirit of Gates, demon-inspired, would manifest.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A few minutes of that scene, and then the Turk sat up. His face
        expressed the most extreme pleasure. It was the release of a soul from
        agony that showed itself. But he must have known that his time was
        short, for he spoke rapidly and earnestly, with febrile energy. And his
        words were commanding and convincing: Vesquit had no doubt that they
        were in presence of knowledge vastly superior to anything that he had
        yet found.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He wrote down the speech upon the tablets that he had prepared
        for the purpose. &quot;They are working by the moon towards the Sun.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Hecate will come to help you. Attack from within, not from
        without.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;An old woman and a young man bring victory.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;All the powers are at your service; but they are stronger.
        Treachery shall save you.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Abandon the direct attack; for even now you have called
        down your death upon you. Quick! snap the cord. Conceal yourselves
        awhile. Even so, you are nigh death. Oh haste! Look yonder who is
        standing ready to smite!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The voice dropped. Well was it for Vesquit that he kept his
        presence of mind. The necromancers [207] looked round over their
        shoulders, and in the East was a blue mist shaped like an egg. In the
        midst of it, standing upon two crocodiles, was the image of Brother
        Onofrio, smiling, with his finger upon his lips. Vesquit realized that
        he was in contact with a force a thousand times greater than any at his
        disposal. He obeyed instantly the command
        spoken through Abdul Bey. &quot;I swear,&quot; he cried, raising his
        right hand to heaven, &quot;I swear that we intend you no manner of
        hurt.&quot; He flushed inwardly, knowing it for a lie, and therefore
        useless to avert the blow which he felt poised above him. He sought a
        new form of words. &quot;I swear that we will not seek to break through
        your defences.&quot; This, he thought, should satisfy the captain of the
        gate, and yet permit him to do as he intended in the matter of trying to
        attack from within. Abdul Bey gasped out that it was well, that no more
        could be done, that
        the link with the White Lodge was broken. &quot;But now our own blow
        strikes us to the earth.&quot; He fell backwards, as one dead. In
        another moment Arthwait, with a yell, a last invocation of that fiend
        whom he really believed to be omnipotent, entered into spasmodic
        convulsions, like a man poisoned with strychnine, or dying of tetanus.
        Vesquit, appalled at the fate of his companions, gazed on the figure of
        Brother Onofrio in an agony of fear
        and horror. It retained the infant smile, and Vesquit reached his arms
        toward it. &quot;Mercy!&quot; he cried, &quot;oh, my lord, mercy!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Arthwait was writhing upon the corpses, horribly twisting,
        foaming black blood from his lungs.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        And the old man saw that his life had been an imbecility, that he
        had taken the wrong path.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio still smiled. &quot;Oh my lord!&quot; cried
        Vesquit, rising to his feet, &quot;'twere better I should die.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;The formula of humanity is the willing acceptance [208] of
        death; and as love, in the male, is itself of the nature of a voluntary
        death, and therefore a sacrament, so that he who loves slays himself,
        therefore he who slays himself that life may live becomes a lover.
        Vesquit stretched out his arms in the sign of the cross, the symbol of
        Him who gives life through his own death, or of the instrument of that
        life and of that death, of the Holy One appointed from the foundation of
        the world as its redeemer.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was as if there had come to him a flash of that most secret
        Word of all initiated knowledge, so secret and so simple that it may be
        declared openly in the market-place, and no man hear it. At least he
        realized himself as a silly old man, whose weakness and pliability in
        the hands of evil men had made him their accomplice. And he saw that
        death, grasped now, might save him.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio still smiled.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I invoke the return of the current!&quot; cried Vesquit
        aloud; and thus, uniting justice with self-sacrifice, he died the death
        of the righteous.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The image of Brother Onofrio faded away.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The great operation of necromancy had come to naught.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Yet the writing remained; and, nearly a day later, when Abdul
        Bey came to himself, it was the first thing that caught his eye. He
        thrust it into his shroud, automatically; then stumbled to his feet, and
        sought his colleagues. At his feet the old coroner lay dead; Arthwait,
        his convulsions terminated by exhaustion approximating coma, lay with
        his head upon the carrion, his tongue, lolling from his mouth, chewed to
        a bloody pulp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Turk carried him from the chapel to the villa. His high
        connexions made it easy for him to secure a silent doctor to certify the
        death of Vesquit, and to attend to Arthwait, who passed from one [209]
        convulsion to another at frequent intervals. It was almost a month
        before he could be considered out of danger, but a week after that he
        was his own man again. They repaired immediately to Paris to lay the
        case before Douglas; for even Arthwait was compelled to recognize some
        elements in the business which were not satisfactory, incidents which
        he could not but regard as indicating that he had fallen appreciably
        short of his high standard of success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The day succeeding the exploit of the necromancers dawned gay and
        bright. The earth dried up again, but breathed refreshment. A light mist
        hung over the walled garden where Iliel stood upon her terrace.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The moon sank large and pale over the ocean as sunrise awoke the
        waves, and Iliel, her vigil almost ended, prepared for the ceremony that
        ended her day.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But no sooner had she gone to the care of her hand-maidens than
        Cyril Grey came down the garden with Brother Onofrio. Their arms were
        crossed upon their breasts in the stately fashion of the Order; and
        Brother Onofrio's scarlet robe contrasted magnificently with the soft
        green silk of Brother Cyril's.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the eyes of the Italian was a passionate reverence for the
        younger, but more gifted, man, coupled with a human affection which was
        almost more than friendship; there was in it the devotion, selfless and
        unsleeping, which is only possible to those of immense singleness of
        heart. He understood that Brother Cyril was of a finer mould than
        himself; he seemed to be rather a flame of fire than a man, so subtle
        and so keen was he. For in every talk, whenever he thought that he had
        sounded Cyril's guard, he suddenly found, on the riposte, that he had
        lost touch of his blade without knowing it. But he burned with constant
        ardour to know more of his idol; and this morning the young man had
        awakened him softly with a whisper, smiling, with a finger pointed to
        the terrace: &quot;Let's go over [210] there, where the Chancellor of
        the Exchequer can't hear us.&quot; So they had risen and come down to
        the lily-pool, after the morning adoration of the Sun, and their daily
        exercise of meditation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Cyril proved to be in his airiest mood,
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do you remember who said `Surtout, pas de zele'?&quot; he
        began. &quot;Whoever it was then, I'm saying it now. Brother Onofrio,
        big brother, strong brother, clever brother, it won't do. You're doing
        much too well. Think you're a Russian General, if that will assist your
        feeble intelligence; but what you think doesn't matter, so long as you
        understand that to win too many victories is as bad as to eat toujours
        perdrix. You have not merely defended this excellent citadel, for which
        I formally tender you the thanks of the Republic. You may kiss my hand.
        But you have pursued the defeated enemy; you have annihilated their
        strongest regiments; and, after last night, I am afraid that they will
        abandon the attack altogether. The situation is lamentable.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But they invoked the death-current themselves,&quot;
        objected Brother Onofrio. &quot;How could I tell that they would send
        for poor old Vesquit, and prepare an operation so formidable that
        something definite was bound to happen, one way or the other?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But you failed to deal gently with the young man Gates!
        &quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I know I'm liable to be carried away by a Tarot divination;
        but he was himself attempting a magical murder. You can't work things
        except on their own plane. He who taketh the sword shall perish by the
        sword.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I dare say you're right; but I'm terribly afraid you've
        scared the game. I wanted to have Douglas and Balloch down here; then
        was the moment to turn loose those engines of destruction.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You might have told me.&quot; [211]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ah, if I had only known!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio gave a savage gesture. Once again he was being
        eluded.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I only realized just now how fit and final were your
        labours. And now we are going to eat our hearts out in enervating
        peace and Capuan luxury. Alas! Think of the fate of Hannibal and of
        Napoleon. Always the same story -- too much victory!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio bounded again in his amazement. &quot;Peace!
        Luxury!&quot; he cried. &quot;Haven't we got the Great Experiment?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Have we?&quot; sighed Cyril, languidly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Isn't the crisis in a month?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;There are twelve months in a year.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio rose in indignation. He hated to be played with
        in this manner; he could see no point in the jest, if it were one; or
        excuse for the rudeness, in the alternative.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Sit down, sit down!&quot; said Cyril dreamily. &quot;You
        say yourself the crisis is not for a month. What a wonderful way is
        Ocean, girdling the five continents like a mother with her children. I
        should like to sail out westward, past the Pillars of Hercules, and up
        into the stormy reaches of the Bay, and -- ah well! it may not be. We
        are held here by our stern duty; we are the chosen warriors of the Final
        Battle to decide whether men shall mould their own destiny, or remain
        the toys of Fate; we are the pioneers of the Great Experiment. To arms,
        Brother Onofrio! Be diligent! Be courageous! The crisis is upon us -- a
        month, no more! Return to me with your shield, or upon it!
        
        </p>
        <p>Dulce
        et decorum est pro patria mori.&quot; 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Ah! now I understand you!&quot; cried Onofrio warmly,
        clasping him in the impulsive Italian fashion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That's splendid of you,&quot; he said brightly. &quot;I do
        appreciate that.&quot; [212]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio wriggled again.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I half think,&quot; he said &quot;that you know the Great
        Experiment will be a failure, and that for some reason you don't
        care!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The bluntness of the British diplomat was no match for the
        subtlety of the ambitious, wily, and astute Italian.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Confound it! Is there anything real or true to you?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Wine, spirits, and cigars.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You won't be serious You jest about everything most vital;
        and you make solemnities of merest wisps of fancy. You would make
        drumsticks of your father's bones, and choose a wife by blowing a
        puff-ball!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;While you would go without music for fear of disturbing
        your father, and choose a wife by the smell of a powder-puff.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, how can you do it?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Cyril shook his head
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I must explain myself more carefully,&quot; he said.
        &quot;Let me ask you, in the first place, what is the most serious thing
        in the world.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Religion.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Exactly. Now, what is religion? The consummation of the
        soul by itself in divine ecstasy. What is life but love, and what is
        love but laughter? In other words, religion is a joke. There is the
        spirit of Dionysus and there is the spirit of Pan; but they are twin
        phases of laughter. Religion is a joke. Now what is the most absurd
        thing in the world?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Woman.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Right again. And therefore she is the only serious island
        in this ocean of laughter. While we hunt and fish, and fight, and
        otherwise take our pleasure, she is toiling in the fields and cooking,
        and bearing children. So, all the serious words are jests, [213] and all
        the jokes are earnest. This, oh my brother, is the key to my light and
        sparkling conversation.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But --- &quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I know what you are going to say. You can reverse it again.
        That is precisely the idea. You keep on reversing it; and it gets
        funnier and more serious every time, and it spins faster and faster
        until you cannot follow it, and your brain begins to whirl, and
        presently you become That Spiral Force which is of the Quintessence of
        the Absolute. So it is all a simple and easy method of attaining the
        summit of perfections, the stone of the Wise, True Wisdom and Perfect
        Happiness.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Listening to you,&quot; reflected Brother Onofrio, with a
        whisk of the rapier, &quot;produces something of this effect!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Then praise the Father of All for making me, and let us go
        to break our fast!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the refectory a telegram awaited Cyril Grey. He read it
        carefully, destroyed it, and, looking with quaint spieglish eyes at
        Brother Onofrio, refrained ostentatiously from a prolonged fit of
        laughter. His face grew exceedingly grave, and he spoke with the
        weightiest deliberation. &quot;I deeply regret to be obliged to inform
        you,&quot; he said at last, &quot;that the exigencies of the situation
        combine to make it incumbent on me to proceed to instant action by
        asking you to pass the sugar.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With sullen grace Brother Onofrio complied. &quot;What saith the&nbsp;
        Scripture?&quot; asked Cyril, still more portentous.
        &quot;Ornithi gluku -- a little bit of sugar for the bird!&quot; [214]
