        THE RENEWAL OF THE GREAT ATTACK; AND HOW IT FARED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        DOUGLAS had been decidedly put out by the death of his wife.
        After all, she had been a sort of habit; a useful drudge, when all was
        said. Besides, he missed, acutely, the pleasures of torturing her. His
        suspicions of the bona fides of Balloch were conjoined with actual
        annoyance.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was at this painful moment in his career that Cremers came to
        the rescue. A widowed friend of hers had left a daughter in her charge:
        for Cremers had the great gift of inspiring confidence. This daughter
        was being educated in a convent in Belgium. The old woman immediately
        telegraphed for her, and presented her to Douglas with the compliments
        of the season. Nothing could have been more timely or agreeable. She was
        a gentle innocent child, as pretty and charming as he had ever seen. It
        was a great point in the game of the astute Cremers to have pleased the
        sorcerer; and she began insensibly to gain ascendancy over his spirit.
        He had at first suspected her of being an emissary of his colleague,
        &quot;A.B.&quot; who might naturally wish to destroy him. For the plan
        of the sorcerer who wishes to be sole and supreme is to destroy all
        rivals, enemies, and companions; while the magician attains supremacy in
        Unity by constantly uniting himself with others, and finding himself
        equally in every element of existence. It is the difference between hate
        and love. [292] He had been careful to examine her magically, and found
        no trace of &quot;A.B.&quot; in her &quot;aura.&quot; On the contrary,
        he concluded that her ambition was to supplant &quot;A.B.&quot;; and
        that went well with his own ideas. But first he must get her into his
        Fourteen, and have a permanent hold over her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She, on the other hand, appeared singly desirous of making
        herself a treasure to him. She knew the one torment that gnawed
        continually at his liver, the hate of Cyril Grey. And she proposed to
        herself to win him wholly by offering that gentleman's scalp. She
        sharpened her linguistic tomahawk.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        One fine day in April she tackled him openly on the subject.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Say, great one, you `n' I gotta have another peek at that
        sperrit writing. Seems t' me that was a fool's game down there.&quot;
        She jerked her head towards the river. &quot;And I don't say but what
        you done right about Balloch.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Douglas glanced at her sharply in his most dangerous mood. How
        much did she know of a certain recent manoeuvre? But she went on quite
        placidly.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Now, look `e here. We gotta get these guys. An' we gotta
        get them where they live. You been hitting at their strong point. Now I
        tell you something. That girl she live five years with Lavinia King,
        durn her! I see that bright daughter of Terpsichore on'y five minutes,
        but she didn't leave one moral hangin' on me, no, sir. Now see here, big
        chief, you been beatin' the water for them fish, an', natural, off they
        goes. For the land's sake! Look `e here, I gotta look after this
        business. An' all I need is just one hook an' line, an' a pailful o'
        bait, an' ef I don' land her, never trus' me no more. Ain't I somebody,
        all ways? Didn' I down ole Blavatzsky? Sure I did. An' ain't this like
        eatin' pie after that?&quot; [293]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The sorcerer deliberated with himself a while. Then he consulted
        his familiar demons. The omens were confusing. He thought that perhaps
        he had put his question ambiguously, and tried again in other words. He
        had begun by asking vaguely &quot;whether Cremers would succeed in her
        mission,&quot; which had earned him a very positive &quot;yes,&quot;
        flanked by a quite unintelligible message about &quot;deception,&quot;
        &quot;the false Dmitri&quot; and &quot;the wrong horse,&quot; also some
        apparent nonsense about Scotland and an island. This time he asked
        whether Cremers would succeed in luring Lisa to her destruction. This
        time the answer was more favourable, though tremulous. But ever since
        his wife's death, his demons had behaved very strangely. They seemed the
        prey of hesitation and even of fear. Such as it was, however, their
        voice now jumped with his own convictions, and he agreed to her
        proposal.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They spent the evening merrily in torturing a cat by blinding it,
        and then squirting sulphuric acid on it from a syringe;
        and in the morning Cremers, with Abdul Bey for bait, set out upon her
        journey to Naples. Arrived in that favoured spot, she bade Abdul Bey
        enjoy the scenery, and hold his peace. She would warn him when the hour
        struck. For Cremers was a highly practical old person. She was not like
        St. James' devils, who believe and tremble; she disbelieved, but she
        trembled all the same. She hated Truth, because the Truth sets men free,
        and therefore
        makes them happy; but she had too much sense to shut her eyes to it; and
        though she doubted the causes of magick, and scoffed at all spiritual
        theory, she could not deny the effects. It was no idle boast of hers
        that she had destroyed Madame Blavatzsky. Together with another woman,
        she had wormed her way into the big-hearted Theosophist's confidence,
        and betrayed her foully at the proper moment. She [294] had tried the
        same game on another adept; but, when he found her out, and she knew it,
        he had merely continued his kindnesses. The alternative before her was
        repentance or brain fever; and she had chosen the latter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her disbelief in magick had left her with its correlate, a belief
        in death. It was the one thing she feared, besides magick itself. But
        she did not make the mistake of being in a hurry, on that account. The
        strength of her character was very great, in its own way; and she
        possessed infinite reserves of patience. She played the game with no
        thought of the victory; and this is half the secret of playing most
        games of importance. To do right for its
        own sake is Righteousness, though if you apply this obvious truth to Art
        the Philistine calls you names, and your morals in question.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cremers was a genuine artist in malice. She was not even glad
        when she had harmed a friend and benefactor, however irreparably;
        nothing could ever make her glad -- but she was contented with herself
        on such occasions. She felt a sort of sense of duty done. She denied
        herself every possible pleasure, she hated happiness in the abstract in
        a genuinely Puritan spirit, and she objected to eat a good dinner
        herself as much as to consent that anyone else should eat it. Her
        principal motive in assisting Abdul Bey to his heart's desire was the
        cynical confidence
        that Lisa was capable of pouring him out a hell-broth at least forty per
        cent above proof.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The summer was well begun. The sun had turned toward the southern
        hemisphere once more; he had entered the Sign of the Lion, and with
        fierce and noble heat scarred the dry slopes of Posilippo. Iliel spent
        most of her time on the Terrace of the Moon at her needlework, watching
        the ships as they sailed by, or the peasants at their labour or their
        pastimes. [295]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was a little before sunset on the first of August. She was
        leaning over the wall of the Terrace. Sister Clara had gone up to the
        house to make ready for the adoration of the setting of the sun. Up the
        uneven flagstones of the lane below toiled the old fishwife with her
        burden, and looked up with the usual cheery greeting. At that moment the
        crone slipped and fell. &quot;I'm afraid I've hurt my back,&quot; she
        cried, with an adjuration to some saint. &quot;I
        can't get up.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Iliel, whether she understood the Italian words fully or no,
        could not mistake the nature of the accident. She did not hesitate; in a
        moment she had lowered herself from the wall. She bent down and gave her
        hand to the old woman.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Say,&quot; said the woman in English, &quot;that boy's just
        crazy about you; and he's the loveliest man on God's earth. Won't you
        say one word to him?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa's jaw dropped in amazement. &quot;What? Who?&quot; she
        stammered.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Why, that perfectly sweet Turk, Abdul. Sure, you know him,
        dearie!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cremers was watching Lisa's face; she read the answer. She gave a
        low whistle, and round the corner Abdul Bey came running. He took Lisa
        in his arms, and rained kisses passionately on her mouth.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She had no thought of resistance. The situation entranced her.
        The captive princess; the intrigue; the fairy prince; every syllable was
        a poem.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I've longed for you every hour for months,&quot; she cried,
        between his kisses; &quot;why, oh why didn't you come for me
        before?&quot; She had no idea that she was not telling the truth. The
        past was wiped clean out of her mind by the swirl of the new impulse;
        and once outside the enchanted circle of the garden, her vow in tatters,
        there was nothing to remind her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm -- here -- now. &quot;The words burst, like [296]
        explosions, from his lips. &quot;Come. I've got a yacht waiting.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Take me -- oh, take me -- where you will.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cremers was on her feet, spry and business-like. &quot;We're best
        out of here,&quot; she said. &quot;Let's beat it!&quot; Taking Lisa's
        arms, she and Abdul hurried her down the steps which led to the
        Shore-road.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio's. patrol witnessed the scene. He took no notice;
        it was not against that contingency that he was armed. But at the
        summons to the Adoration he reported the event to his superior.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Brother Onofrio received the news in silence, and proceeded to
        perform the ceremony of the Salutation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        An hour later, as supper ended, the sound of the bell rang
        through the House. The visitor was Simon Iff.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He found Cyril dressed in every-day clothes, no more in his green
        robe. The boy was smoking a cigar upon the Terrace where he had read his
        poem on the day after Walpurgis Night.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He did not rise to greet his master. &quot;Tell the Praetor that
        you have seen Caius Marius a fugitive seated upon the ruins of
        Carthage!&quot; he exclaimed.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Don't take it so hardly, boy!&quot; cried the old mystic.
        &quot;The man who makes no mistakes makes nothing. But it is my duty to
        reprove you, and we had better get it over. Your whole operation was
        badly conceived; in one way or another it was bound to fail. You select
        a woman with no moral strength -- not even with that code of convention
        which helps so many weak creatures through their temptations. I foresaw
        from the first that soon or late she would throw up the
        Experiment.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Your words touch me the more deeply because I also foresaw
        it from the first.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yet you went on with it.&quot; [297]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh no!&quot; Cyril's eyes were half closed.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;What do you mean -- Oh, no!&quot; cried the other sharply.
        He knew his Cyril like a book.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I never even began,&quot; murmured the boy, dreamily.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You will be polite to explain yourself.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon's lips took a certain grimness of grip upon themselves.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;This telegram has consoled me in my grief,&quot; said
        Cyril, taking with languid grace a slip of paper from his pocket.
        &quot;It came last week.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Simon Iff turned it towards the light. &quot;Horatii,&quot; he
        read. &quot;A code word, I suppose. But this is dated from Iona, from
        the Holy House where Himself is!&quot; &quot;Himself&quot; was the word
        used in the Order to designate its Head.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; said Cyril, softly, &quot;I was fortunate enough
        to interest Himself in the Experiment; so Sister Cybele has been there,
        under the charge of the Mahathera Phang!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You young devil!&quot; It was the first time that Simple
        Simon had been startled in forty years. &quot;So you arranged this
        little game to draw the enemy's fire?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Naturally, the safety of Sister Cybele was the first
        consideration.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And 'Horatii'?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's not a code word. I think it must be Roman
        History.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Three Boys!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Rather a lot, isn't it?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;They'll be needed,&quot; said Simon grimly. &quot;I have
        been doing magick too.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do tell me.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The Quest of the Golden Fleece, Cyril. I've been sowing the
        Dragon's Teeth; you remember? Armed men sprang to life, and killed each
        other.&quot; [298]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But I don't see any armed men.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You will. Haven't you seen the papers?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I never see papers. I'm a poet, and I like my lies the way
        mother used to make them.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Well, Europe's at war I have got your old commission back
        for you, with an appointment as Inteelligence Officer on the staf of
        General Cripps.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It sounds like Anarchism. From each according to his
        powers; to each according to his needs, you know. By the way, what's it
        about? Anything?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The people think it's about the violation of solemn
        treaties, and the rights of the little nations, and so on; the governments
        think it's about commercial expansion; but I who made it know that it is
        the baptism of blood of the New Aeon. How could we promulgate the Law of
        Liberty in a world where Freedom has been strangled by industrialism?
        Men have become such slaves that they submit to laws which would have
        made a revolution in any
        other country since the world began; they have registration cards harder
        to bear than iron fetters; they allow their tyrants to bar them from
        every pleasure that even their poverty allows them. There is only one
        way to turn the counter-jumper into a Curtius and the factory girl into
        a Cornelia; and I have taken it.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;How did you work it? &quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It has been a long business, But as you know. Sir Edward is
        a mystic. You saw that article on fishing, I suppose?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh yes; I knew that. But I didn't know it was more
        definite.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was he did it. But he'll lose his place; he's too fair-minded;
        and in a year they'll clamour for fanatics. It's all right;
        they'll butt each other's brains out; and then the philosophers will
        come back, and build up a nobler type of civilization.&quot;
        [299]</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I think you accused me recently of using strong
        medicine.&quot;

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I was practising British hypocrisy on you. I had to see the
        Prime Minister that week. Excuse me if I answer a humourist according to
        his humour. I want to show you how necessary this step has been.
        Observe: the bourgeois is the real criminal, always.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm with you there.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Look at the testimony of literature. In the days of
        chivalry our sympathies go with the Knight-errant, who redresses wrongs;
        with the King, whose courage and wisdom deliver his people from their
        enemies. But when Kingship became tyranny, and feudalism oppression, we
        took our heroes from the rebels. Robin Hood, Hereward the Wake, Bonnie
        Prince Charlie, Rob Roy; it was always the Under Dog that appealed to
        the artist. Then industrialism became paramount, and we began -- in
        Byron's time -- to sympathize with brigands and corsairs. Presently
        these were wiped out, and to-day or rather, the day before yesterday, we
        were reduced to loving absolute scoundrels, Arsene Lupin, Raffles,
        Stingaree, Fantomas, and a hundred others, or the detectives who (although
        on the side of society) were equally occupied in making the police look
        like fools. That is the whole charm of Pere What's-his-name in Gaboriau,
        and Dupin, and Sherlock Holmes. There has never been a really
        sympathetic detectlve in fiction who was on good terms with the police!
        And you must remember that the
        artist always represents the subconscious will of the people. The
        literary hack who panders to the bourgeois, and makes his heroes of
        millionaires' sons, has never yet created a character, and never will.
        Well, when the People love a burglar, and hate a judge, there's
        something wrong with the judges.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But what are you doing here, in a world-crisis?&quot; [300]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm over here to buy Italy. Bowling bought Belgium, you
        know, some time back. He was thick with Leopold, but the old man had too
        much sense to deal. He knew he would be the first to go smash when the
        war came. But Albert pocketed the good red gold without a second
        thought; that's partly what the trouble is over. Germany found out about
        it.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And why buy Italy? To keep Austria busy, I suppose? These
        Wops can hardly hope to force the line, especially with the Trentino
        Salient on the flank.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That's the idea. It would have been better and cheaper to
        buy Bulgaria. But Grey wouldn't see it. There's the eternal fear of
        Russia to remember. We're fighting against both sides in the Balkans!
        And that makes Russia half-hearted, and endangers the whole Entente. But
        it doesn't matter so long as enough people are killed. The survivors
        must have elbow-room for their souls, and the memory of heroic deeds in
        the lives of them and theirs to weigh against the everlasting pull of
        material welfare. When those men come back from a few years in the
        trenches, they'll make short work of the pious person that informs them
        of the wickedness of smoking, and eating meat, and drinking beer, and
        being out after eleven o'clock at night, and kissing a girl, and reading
        novels, and playing cards, and going to the theatre, and whistling on
        the Sabbath!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I hope you're right. You're old, which tends, I suppose, to
        make you optimistic. In my young ears there always rings the scream of
        terror of the slave when you offer to strike off his fetters.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;All Europe will be scream and stench for years to come. But
        the new generation will fear neither poverty nor death. They will fear
        weakness; they will fear dishonour.&quot; [301] 
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It is a great programme. Qui vivra verra. Meanwhile, I
        suppose I report to General Cripps.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;You will meet him, running hard, I expect, somewhere in
        France. It will be a fluke if Paris is saved. As you know, it always
        takes England three years to put her boots on. If we had listened to the
        men who knew -- like 'Bobs' -- and fixed up an army of three millions,
        there could have been no war -- at least, not in this particular tangle
        of alliances. There would have been a Social Revolution, more likely, an
        ignoble business of greed against greed, which would have left men viler
        and more enslaved than ever. As it is, the masses on both sides think
        they are fighting for ideals; only the governments know what hypocrisy
        and sham it is; so the ideals will win, both in defeat and victory. Man!
        only three days ago France was the France of Panama, and Dreyfus, and
        Madame Humbert, and Madame Steinheil, and Madame Caillaux; and to-day
        she is already the France of Roland and Henri
        Quatre and Danton and Napoleon and Gambetta and Joan of Arc!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And England of the Boer wars, and the Irish massacres, and
        the Marconi scandals, and Tranby Croft?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, give England time! She'll have to be worse before she's
        better!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Talking of time, I must pack up if I'm to catch the morning
        train for the Land of Hope and Glory.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The train service is disorganized. I came from Toulon in a
        destroyer; she'll take you back there. Jack Manners is in command.
        Report at Toulon to the O.C.! You'd better start in half-an-hour, I'll
        see you safe on board. My car's at the door. Here s your
        commission!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey thrust the document into his pocket, and the two men
        went up into the house.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        An hour later they were aboard the destroyer; [302] they shook
        hands in silence. Simon Iff went down the gangway, and Manners gave the
        word. As they raced northward, they passed under the lee of Abdul's
        yacht, where Lisa, up to the eyes in champagne, was fondling her new
        lover.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her little pig-like eyes sparkled through their rolls of fat; her
        cheeks, the colour and consistency of ripe Camembert cheese, sagged
        pendulous upon a many-chinned neck which looked almost goitrous; and the
        whole surmounted one of those figures dear to engineers, because they
        afford endless food for speculation as to the means of support. The moon
        was now exercising her full influence, totally unchecked and unbalanced;
        and the woman's nature being wholly of the body, with as little brain in
        proportion as a rhinoceros, the effect was seen mostly on the physical
        plane. Her mind was a mere swamp of succulent luxury. So she sat there
        and swayed and wallowed over Abdul Bey. Cremers thought she looked like
        a snow man just beginning to melt.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With a sardonic grin, the old woman waved her hand, and went on
        deck. The yacht was now well out in the open sea on her way to
        Marseilles. Here Cremers was to be landed, so that she might return to
        Paris to report her success to Douglas, while the lovers went on their
        honeymoon. The wind blew fresh from the south-west, and Cremers, who was
        a good sailor, came as near as she ever could to joy as she felt the
        yacht begin to roll, and pictured the tepid ice-cream heroine of romance
        in the saloon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Meanwhile, the destroyer, her nose burrowing into the sea hike a
        ferret slipped into a warren, drove passionately towards Toulon. The
        keenness and ecstasy of Cyril's face were so intense that Manners
        rallied him about it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I thought you were one of the all-men-are- [303] brothers
        crowd,&quot; he said. &quot; Yet you're as keen as mustard to slay your
        cousin-German.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Puns,&quot; replied Cyril, &quot;are the torpedo-boat
        destroyers of the navy wit. Consider yourself crushed. Your matchless
        intelligence has not misled you as to my views. All men <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">are</i>
        brothers. As a magician, I embrace, I caress, I slobber over the cheeks
        of Bloody Bill. But fighting in the army is not a magical ceremony. It
        is the senseless, idiotic, performance of a numskull, the act, in a
        word, of a gentleman; and as, to my lasting shame, I happened to be born
        in that class, I love to do it. Be reasonable! It's no pleasure to me,
        as an immortal God, to sneeze;
        I refuse to render myself a laughing-stock to the other Olympians by
        such indignity; but when my body has a cold in its head, it is proper
        for it to blow its nose. I do not approve, much less participate; and my
        body is therefore the more free to act according to its nature, and it
        blows its nose much harder than it would if I took a hand. That is the
        advantage of being a magician; all one's different parts are free to act
        with the utmost possible vigour according to their own natures, because
        the other parts do not interfere with them. You don't let your navigators
        into the stoke-hole, or your stokers into the chart-house. The first art
        in adeptship is to get your elements sorted out and specialized and
        organized and disciplined. Here endeth the first lesson. I think I'll
        turn in.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;It's a bit beyond me, Cyril. All I know is that I'm willing
        to risk my life in a good cause.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;But it's a rotten bad cause! We have isolated Germany and
        hemmed her in for years exactly as we did a century ago with Napoleon;
        Wilhelm, who wanted peace, because he was getting fat on it, knew us for
        his real enemy. In `ninety-nine he came within [304] an ace of uniting
        Europe against us, at the time of the Fashoda incident. But we baffled
        him, and since then he has been getting deeper in every moment. He tried
        again over the Boer war. He tried threats, he tried diplomacy, he tried
        everything. The Balkan War and the Agadir incident showed him his utter
        helplessness. The kingdom of Albania! The war in Tripoli proved that he
        could no longer rely on Italy. And when Russia resorted to so shameless
        an assassination as that of Sarajevo --&nbsp;
        my dear good man! England has been a pirate as she always was.
        From Hengist and Horsa, and the Vikings, she first learnt the trick.
        William the Conqueror was a pirate; so was Francis Drake. Look at
        Morgan, whom we knighted, and all the other buccaneers! Look at our
        system of privateering! Ever hear of the 'Alabama'? We learnt the secret
        of sea-power; we can cut the alimentary canal of any nation in Europe --
        bar Switzerland and Russia. Hence our fear of Russia! It's the Jolly
        Roger you should fly, Jack Manners! We stood all Germany's expansion; we
        said we were her cousins -- but when she, started a Navy, that was
        another barrel of fish!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I don't think I can bear this, you know!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Cheer up! I'm one of the pirate crew!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, you're Captain Kidd!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I have already stated my opinion as to the conversational
        value of puns. I'm going to turn in; you get busy, and find a neutral
        ship to rob.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I shall do my best to maintain the law of the sea.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Made by the pirate to suit his game. Good God! I can't see
        why we shouldn't be sensible. Why must we invoke Law and Gospel every
        time we want to do a dirty act? My character's strong enough to let me
        kill all the Germans I can without persuading myself that I'm saving
        them from Prusian Tyranny! Good-night!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The youth is unintelligible or immoral,&quot; thought
        Manners, as he turned his face to the spindrift; &quot;but I bet he
        kills a lot of Germans!&quot; [305]
