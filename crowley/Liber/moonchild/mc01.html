        CHINESE GOD</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        LONDON, in England, the capital city of the British Empire, is
        situated upon the banks of the Thames. It is not likely that these facts
        were unfamiliar to James Abbott McNeill Whistler, a Scottish gentleman
        born in America and resident in Paris but it is certain that he did not
        appreciate them. For he settled quietly down to discover a fact which no
        one had previously observed; namely, that it was very beautiful at
        night. The man was
        steeped in Highland fantasy, and he revealed London as Wrapt in a soft
        haze of mystic beauty, a fairy tale of delicacy and wistfulness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is here that the Fates showed partiality; for London should
        rather have been painted by Goya. The city is monstrous and misshapen;
        its mystery is not a brooding, but a conspiracy. And these truths are
        evident above all to one who recognizes that London's heart is Charing
        Cross.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        For the old Cross, which is, even technically, the centre of the
        city, is so in sober moral geography. The Strand roars toward Fleet
        Street, and so to Ludgate Hill, crowned by St. Paul's Cathedral;
        Whitehall sweeps down to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.
        Trafalgar Square, which guards it at the third angle, saves it to some
        extent from the modern banalities of Piccadilly and Pall Mall, mere
        Georgian sham stucco, not even rivals to [9] the historic grandeur of
        the great religious monuments, for Trafalgar really did make history;
        but it is to be observed that Nelson, on his monument, is careful to
        turn his gaze upon the Thames. For here is the true life of the city,
        the aorta of that great heart of which London and Westminster are the
        ventricles. Charing Cross Station, moreover, is the only true
        Metropolitan terminus. Euston, St. Pancras, and King's Cross merely
        convey one to the provinces, even, perhaps, to savage Scotland, as nude
        and barren to-day as in the time of Dr. Johnson; Victoria and Paddington
        seem to serve the vices of Brighton and Bournemouth in winter,
        Maidenhead and Henley in summer. Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street
        are mere suburban sewers; Waterloo is the funereal antechamber to Woking;
        Great Central is a &quot;notion&quot; imported, name and all, from
        Broadway, by an enterprising kind of railway Barnum, named Yerkes;
        nobody ever goes there, except to golf at Sandy Lodge. If there are any
        other terminals in London, I forget them; clear proof of their
        insignificance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Charing Cross dates from before the Norman Conquest. Here
        Caesar scorned the advances of Boadicea, who had come to the station to
        meet him; and here St. Augustin uttered his famous mot, &quot;Non Angli,
        sed angeli.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Stay: there is no need to exaggerate. Honestly, Charing Cross is
        the true link with Europe, and therefore with history. It understands
        its dignity and its destiny; the station officials never forget the
        story of King Alfred and the cakes, and are too wrapped in the cares of
        -- who knows what? -- to pay any attention to the necessities of
        would-be travellers. The speed of the trains is adjusted to that of the
        Roman Legions: three miles per hour. And they are always late, in honour
        of the immortal Fabius, &quot;qui cunctando restituit rem.&quot; [10]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This terminus is swathed in immemorial gloom; it was in one of
        the waiting-rooms that James Thomson conceived the idea for his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">City
        of Dreadful Night</i>; but it is still the heart of London, throbbing
        with a clear longing towards Paris. A man who goes to Paris from
        Victoria will never reach Paris! He will find only the city
        of the demi-mondaine and the tourist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was not by appreciation of these facts, it was not even by
        instinct, that Lavinia King chose to arrive at Charing Cross. She was,
        in her peculiar, esoteric style, the most famous dancer in the world;
        and she was about to poise upon one exquisite toe in London, execute one
        blithe pirouette, and leap to Petersburg. No: her reason for alighting
        at Charing Cross was utterly unconnected with any one of the facts
        hitherto discussed; had you asked her, she would have replied with her
        unusual smile, insured for seventy-five thousand dollars, that it was
        convenient for the Savoy Hotel.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So, on that October night, when London almost shouted its pity
        and terror at the poet, she only opened the windows of her suite because
        it was unseasonably hot. It was nothing to her that they gave on to the
        historic Temple Gardens; nothing that London's favourite bridge for
        suicides loomed dark beside the lighted span of the railway.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was merely bored with her friend and constant companion, Lisa
        la Giuffria, who had been celebrating her birthday for twenty-three
        hours without cessation as Big Ben tolled eleven.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa was having her fortune told for the eighth time that day by
        a lady so stout and so iron-clad in corsets that any reliable authority
        on high explosives might have been tempted to hurl her into Temple
        Gardens, lest a worse thing come unto him, and so intoxicated that she
        was certainly worth her weight in grape-juice to any Temperance
        lecturer. [11]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The name of this lady was Amy Brough, and she told the cards with
        resistless reiteration. &quot;You'll certainly have thirteen birthday
        presents,&quot; she said, for the hundred and thirteenth time, &quot;and
        that means a death in the family. Then there's a letter about a journey;
        and there's something about a dark man connected with a large building.
        He is very tall, and I think there's a journey coming to you --
        something about a letter. Yes; nine and three's twelve, and one's
        thirteen; you'll certainly have thirteen presents.&quot; &quot;I've only
        had twelve,&quot; complained Lisa, who was tired, bored, and peevish.
        &quot;Oh, forget it! &quot;snapped Lavinia King from the window,
        &quot;you've got an hour to go, anyhow!&quot; &quot;I see something
        about a large building,&quot; insisted Amy Brough, &quot;I think it
        means Hasty News.&quot; &quot;That's extraordinary!&quot; cried Lisa,
        suddenly awake. &quot;That's what Bunyip said my dream last night meant!
        That's absolutely wonderful! And to think there are people who don't
        believe in clairvoyance!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        From the depths of an armchair came a sigh of infinite sadness
        &quot;Gimme a peach!&quot; Harsh and hollow, the voice issued
        cavernously from a lantern-jawed American with blue cheeks. He was
        incongruously clad in a Greek dress, with sandals. It is difficult to
        find a philosophical reason for disliking the combination of this
        costume with a pronounced Chicago accent. But one does. He was Lavinia's
        brother; he wore the costume as an advertisement; it was part of the
        family game. As he himself would explain in confidence, it made people
        think he was a fool, which
        enabled him to pick their pockets while they were preoccupied with this
        amiable delusion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Who said peaches?&quot; observed a second sleeper, a young
        Jewish artist of uncannily clever powers of observation.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lavinia King went from the window to the table. [12] Four
        enormous silver bowls occupied it. Three contained the finest flowers to
        be bought in London, the tribute of the natives to her talent; the
        fourth was brimmed with peaches at four shillings a peach. She threw one
        apiece to her brother and the Knight of the Silver
        Point.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I can't make out this Jack of Clubs,&quot; went on Amy
        Brough, &quot;it's something about a large building!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Blaustein, the artist, buried his face and his heavy curved
        spectacles in his peach.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, dearie,&quot; went on Amy, with a hiccough,
        &quot;there's a journey about a letter. And nine and one's ten, and
        three's thirteen. You'll get another present, dearie, as sure as I'm
        sitting here.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I really will?&quot; asked Lisa, yawning.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;If I never take my hand off this table again!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, cut it out!&quot; cried Lavinia. &quot;I'm going to
        bed!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;If you go to bed on my birthday I'll never speak to you
        again!&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Oh, can t we do something?&quot; said Blaustein, who never
        did anything, anyhow, but draw.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Sing something!&quot; said Lavinia's brother, throwing away
        the peach-stone, and settling himself again to sleep. Big Ben struck the
        half hour. Big Ben is far too big to take any notice of anything
        terrestrial. A change of dynasty is nothing in his young life!
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Come in, for the land's sake!&quot; cried Lavinia King. Her
        quick ear had caught a light knock upon the door.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;She had hoped for something exciting, but it was only
        her private tame pianist, a cadaverous individual with the manners of an
        undertaker gone mad, the morals of a stool-pigeon, and imagining himself
        a bishop. [13]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I had to wish you many happy returns,&quot; he said to
        Lisa, when he had greeted the company in general, &quot;and I wanted to
        introduce my friend, Cyril Grey.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Every one was amazed. They only then perceived that a second man
        had entered the room without being heard or seen. This individual was
        tall and thin, almost, as the pianist; but he had the peculiar quality
        of failing to attract attention. When they saw him, he acted in the most
        conventional way possible; a smile, and a bow, and a formal handshake,
        and the right word of greeting. But the moment that introductions were
        over, he apparently vanished! The conversation became general; Amy
        Brough went to sleep; Blaustein took his leave; Arnold King followed;
        the pianist rose for the same purpose and looked round for his friend.
        Only then did anyone observe that he was seated on the floor with
        crossed legs, perfectly indifferent to the company.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The effect of the discovery was hypnotic. From being nothing in
        the room, he became everything. Even Lavinia King, who had wearied of
        the world at thirty, and was now forty-three, saw that here was
        something new to her. She looked at that impassive face. The jaw was
        square, the planes of the face curiously fiat. The mouth was small, a
        poppy-petal of vermilion, intensely sensuous. The nose was small and
        rounded, but fine, and the life of the face seemed concentrated in the
        nostrils. The eyes were tiny and oblique, with strange brows of
        defiance. A small tuft of irrepressible hair upon the forehead started
        up like a lone pine-tree on the slope of a mountain; for with this
        exception, the man was entirely bald; or, rather, clean-shaven, for the
        scalp was grey. The skull was extraordinarily narrow and long.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Again she looked at the eyes. They were parallel, [14] focussed
        on infinity. The pupils were pin-points. It was clear to her that he saw
        nothing in the room. Her dancer's vanity came to her rescue; she moved
        in front of the still figure, and made a mock obeisance. She might have
        done the same to a stone image.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To her astonishment, she found the hand of Lisa on her shoulder.
        A look, half shocked, half pious, was in her friend's eyes. She found
        herself rudely pushed aside. Turning, she saw Lisa squatting on the
        floor opposite the visitor, with her eyes fixed upon his. He remained
        apparently quite unconscious of what was going on.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lavinia King was flooded with a sudden causeless anger. She
        plucked her pianist by the arm, and drew him to the window-seat.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Rumour accused Lavinia of too close intimacy with the musician:
        and rumour does not always lie. She took advantage of the situation to
        caress him. Monet-Knott, for that was his name, took her action as a
        matter of course. Her passion satisfied alike his purse and his vanity;
        and, being without temperament -- he was the curate type of ladies' man
        -- he suited the dancer, who would have found a more masterful lover in
        her way. This creature could not even excite the jealousy of the wealthy
        automobile manufacturer who financed her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But this night she could not concentrate her thoughts upon him;
        they wandered continually to the man on the floor. &quot;Who is
        he?&quot; she whispered, rather fiercely, &quot;what did you say his
        name was?&quot; &quot;Cyril Grey,&quot; answered Monet-Knott,
        indifferently; &quot;he's probably the greatest man in England, in his
        art.&quot; &quot;And what's his art?&quot; &quot;Nobody knows,&quot; was
        the surprising reply, &quot;he won't show anything. He's the one big
        mystery of London.&quot; &quot;I never heard such nonsense,&quot;
        retorted the dancer, angrily; &quot;anyhow, I'm from Missouri!&quot; The
        pianist stared. [15] &quot;I mean you've got to show me,&quot; she
        explained; &quot;he looks to me like One Big Bluff! &quot;Monet-Knott
        shrugged his shoulders; he did not care to pursue that topic.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly Big Ben struck midnight. It woke the room to normality.
        Cyril Grey unwound himself, like a snake after six months' sleep; but in
        a moment he was a normal suave gentleman, all smiles and bows again. He
        thanked Miss King for a very pleasant evening; he only tore himself away
        from a consideration of the lateness of the hour---
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do come again!&quot; said Lavinia sarcastically, &quot;one
        doesn't often enjoy so delightful a conversation.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;My birthday's over,&quot; moaned Lisa from the floor,
        &quot;and I haven't got my thirteenth present.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Amy Brough half woke up. &quot;It's something to do with a large
        building,&quot; she began and broke off suddenly, abashed, she knew not
        why.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I'm always in at tea-time,&quot; said Lisa suddenly to
        Cyril. He&nbsp; simpered over her
        hand. Before they realized it, he had bowed himself out of the room.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The three women looked at each other. Suddenly Lavinia King began
        to laugh. It was a harsh, unnatural performance: and for some reason her
        friend took it amiss. She went tempestuously into her bedroom, and
        banged the door behind her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lavinia, almost equally cross, went into the opposite room and
        called her maid. In half-an-hour she was asleep. In the morning she went
        in to see her friend. She found her lying on the bed, still dressed, her
        eyes red and haggard. She had not slept all night. Amy Brough on the
        contrary, was still asleep in the arm-chair. When she was roused, she
        only muttered: &quot;something about a journey in a letter.&quot; Then
        she suddenly shook herself and went
        off without a word to her place of business in Bond [16]</p>
        <p>Street.
        For she was the representative of one of the great Paris dressmaking
        houses.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lavinia King never knew how it was managed; she never realized
        even that it had been managed; hut that afternoon she found herself
        inextricably bound to her motor millionaire.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        So Lisa was alone in the apartment. She sat upon the couch, with
        great eyes, black and lively, staring into eternity. Her black hair
        coiled upon her head, plait over plait; her dark skin glowed; her full
        mouth moved continually.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was not surprised when the door opened without warning. Cyril
        Grey closed it behind him, with swift stealth. She was fascinated; she
        could not rise to greet him. He came over to her, caught her throat in
        both his hands, bent back her head, and, taking her lips in his teeth,
        bit them bit them almost through. It was a single deliberate act:
        instantly he released her, sat down upon the couch by her, and made some
        trivial remark about the
        weather. She gazed at him in horror and amazement. He took no notice; he
        poured out a flood of small-talk -- theatres, politics, literature, the
        latest news of art ---</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Ultimately she recovered herself enough to order tea when the
        maid knocked.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After tea -- another ordeal of small-talk -- she had made up her
        mind. Or, more accurately, she had become conscious of herself. She knew
        that she belonged to this man, body and soul. Every trace of shame
        departed; it was burnt out by the fire that consumed her. She gave him a
        thousand opportunities; she fought to turn his words to serious things.
        He baffled her with his shallow smile and ready tongue, that twisted all
        topics to triviality. By six o'clock she was morally on her knees before
        him; she was imploring him to stay to dinner with her. He refused. He
        was engaged' to dine with a [17] Miss Badger in Cheyne Walk; possibly he
        might telephone later, if he got away early. She begged him to excuse
        himself; he answered -- serious for the first time -- that he never
        broke his word.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At last he rose to go. She clung to him. He pretended mere
        embarrassment. She became a tigress; he pretended innocence, with that
        silly shallow smile.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He looked at his watch. Suddenly his manner changed, like a
        flash. &quot;I'll telephone later, if I can,&quot; he said, with a sort
        of silky ferocity, and flung her from him violently on to the sofa.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He was gone. She lay upon the cushions, and sobbed her heart out.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The whole evening was a nightmare for her -- and also for Lavinia
        King.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The pianist, who had looked in with the idea of dinner, was
        thrown out with objurgations. Why had he brought that cad, that brute,
        that fool? Amy Brough was caught by her fat wrists, and sat down to the
        cards; but the first time that she said &quot;large building,&quot; was
        bundled bodily out of the apartment. Finally, Lavinia was astounded to
        have Lisa tell her that she would not come to see her dance -- her only
        appearance that season in London!
        It was incredible. But when she had gone, thoroughly huffed, Lisa threw
        on her wraps to follow her; then changed her mind before she had gone
        half way down the corridor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her evening was a tempest of indecisions. When Big Ben sounded
        eleven she was lying on the floor, collapsed. A moment later the
        telephone rang. It was Cyril Grey -- of course -- of course -- how could
        it be any other?
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;When are you likely to be in?&quot; he was asking. She
        could imagine the faint hateful smile, as if she had known it all her
        life.&quot; Never!&quot; she answered, [18] &quot;I'm going to Paris the
        first train to-morrow.&quot; &quot;Then I'd better come up now.&quot;
        The voice was nonchalant as death -- or she would have hung up the
        receiver. &quot;You can't come now; I'm undressed!&quot; &quot;Then when
        may I come?&quot; It was terrible, this antinony of persistence with a
        stifled yawn! Her soul failed her. &quot;When you will,&quot; she
        murmured. The receiver dropped from her hand; but she caught one word -
        the word &quot;taxi.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the morning, she awoke, almost a corpse. He had come, and he
        had gone -- he had not spoken a single word, not even given a token that
        he would come again. She told her maid to pack for Paris: but she could
        not go. Instead, she fell ill. Hysteria became neurasthenia; yet she
        knew that a single word would cure her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But no word came. Incidentally she heard that Cyril Grey was
        playing golf at Hoylake; she had a mad impulse to go to find him;
        another to kill herself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Lavinia King, perceiving after many days that something was
        wrong -- after many days, for her thoughts rarely strayed beyond the
        contemplation of her own talents and amusements -- carried her off to
        Paris. She needed her, anyhow, to play hostess.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But three days after their arrival Lisa received a postcard. It
        bore nothing but an address and a question-mark. No signature; she had
        never seen the handwriting; but she knew. She snatched up her hat, and
        her furs, and ran downstairs. Her car was at the door; in ten minutes
        she was knocking at the door of Cyril's studio.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He opened.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        His arms were ready to receive her; but she was on the floor,
        kissing his feet.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;My Chinese God! My Chinese God!&quot; she cried. [19]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;May I be permitted,&quot; observed Cyril, earnestly,
        &quot;to present my friend and master, Mr. Simon Iff?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa looked up. She was in the presence of a man, very old, but
        very alert and active. She scrambled to her feet in confusion.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I am not really the master,&quot; said the old man,
        cordially, &quot;for our host is a Chinese God, as it appears. I am
        merely a student of Chinese Philosophy.&quot; [20]
