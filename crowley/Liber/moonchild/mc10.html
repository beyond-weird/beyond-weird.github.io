        THEY GATHERED THE SILK FOR THE WEAVING OF THE BUTTERFLY-NET
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        CYRIL GREY made the midnight invocation to the Sun-God, Khephra,
        the Winged Beetle, upon the crest of the Long Rocher; and he made the
        morning invocation to the Sun-God, Ra, the Hawk, upon the heights that
        overlooked the hamlet of Barbizon.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Thence, like Chanticleer himself, he woke the people of the Inn,
        who, in memory of the days Stevenson had spent with them, honour his
        ashes by emulating the morality of Long John Silver.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They were prepared for the breakfast order; but Cyril's
        requirement, a long-distance call to Paris, struck them as unseasonable
        and calculated to disturb the balance of the Republic. They asked
        themselves if the Dreyfus case were come again. However, Cyril got his
        call, and Simon Iff his information, before seven o'clock. Long before
        Douglas, who had waited until midnight for the news of his triumph, had
        recovered from the sleep following its celebration, Iff in his fastest
        automobile had picked up the lovers at an agreed spot in the forest, the
        Croix du Grand Maitre, whirled them to Dijon, and put them into the
        train for Marseilles. There they took ship, and came to Naples by sea,
        without adventure.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The enemy, in one way or another, had been thrown utterly off the
        track. [132] It was early in the morning when they landed; at three
        o'clock they had visited such local deities as commanded their more
        urgent piety; the Museum, Vergil's Tomb, also Michaelsen the bookseller
        and vendor of images of the Ineffable. At four they started, hand in
        hand, along the shore, towards their new home.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        An hour's walk brought them to the foot of a long stairway, damp
        stonework, narrow, between high walls, that led vertical and steep to
        the very crest of Posilippo. One could see the old church amid its
        cluster of houses. Cyril pointed to a house a couple of hundred yards
        north of the church. It was the most attractive building on the
        hillside.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The house itself was not large, but it was built like a toy
        imitation of one of those old castles that one sees everywhere on
        difficult heights, throughout most of Southern and even Central Europe;
        in a word, like a castle in a fairy-story. It looked from below, owing
        to foreshortening, as if it were built over a sheer rampart, like the
        Potala at Lhassa; but this was only the effect of merging a series of
        walls which divided the garden by terraces.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Is that the Butterfly-net?&quot; cried Lisa, slapping her
        hands with delight.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;That,&quot; he dissented, &quot;is The Net.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Once again Lisa felt a pang of something like distrust. His trick
        of saying the simplest things as if they bore a second meaning, hidden
        from her, annoyed her. He had been strangely silent on the voyage, and
        wholly aloof from her on those planes where she most needed him; that
        was a necessary condition of the experiment, of course; but none the
        less it tended to disturb her happiness. Such talks as they had had were
        either purely educative,
        Magick in Six Easy Lessons, he called it, or Magick without Tears, or
        else they were conventional lover's chats, which she [133] felt sure he
        despised. He would tell her that her eyes were like the stars; and she
        would think that he meant: &quot;What am I to say to this piece of
        wood?&quot; Even nature seemed to stir his contempt in some way. One
        night she had noticed him rapt in a poetic trance leaning over the bows
        watching the foam. For a long while he remained motionless, his breast
        rising quickly and falling, his lips trembling with passion -- and then
        he
        turned to her and said in cold blood: &quot;Ought that to be used to
        advertize a dentifrice or a shaving soap?&quot; She was sure that he had
        rehearsed the whole scene merely to work her up in order to have the fun
        of dropping her again. Only the next morning she woke early, to find a
        pencilled sonnet on his table, a poem so spiritual, so profound, and of
        such jewelcraft, that she knew why the few people whom he had allowed to
        read his work thought him the match of Milton. So apt were the similes
        that there could be no doubt that he had thought it out line by line, in
        that trance which he had marred, for her, by his brutal anti-climax.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She had asked him about it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Some people,&quot; he had said quite seriously, &quot;have
        one brain; some have two. I have two.&quot; A minute later: &quot;Oh, I
        forgot. Some have none.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She had refused to be snubbed. &quot;What do you mean by your
        having two brains?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I really have. It seems as if; in order to grasp anything,
        I were obliged to take its extremes. I see both the sublime and the
        ridiculous at once, and I can't imagine one existing apart from the
        other, any more than you can have a stick with only one end. So I use
        one point of view to overbalance the other, like a child starting to
        swing itself. I am never happy until I have identified an idea with its
        opposite. I take the idea of murder -- just a plain, horrid idea. But I
        don't stop there. I multiply [134] that murder, and intensify it a
        millionfold, and then a millionfold again. Suddenly one comes out into
        the sublime idea of the Opening of the Eye of Shiva, when the Universe
        is annihilated in an instant. Then I swing back, and make the whole
        thing comic by having the hero chloroform Shiva in the nick of time, so
        that he can marry the beautiful American heiress.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Until I have been all round the clock like that, I don't
        feel that I have the idea at all. If you had only let me go on about the
        shaving soap, I should have made it into something lovely again -- and
        all the time I should have perceived the absolute identity of even the
        two contradictory phases.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But it was beyond her still, in each case as it came up
        &quot;That is the Net!&quot; a riddle? It might mean a thousand things;
        and to a woman of her positive and prosaic temperament (which she had,
        for all her hysteria and romanticism) doubt was torture. Love itself
        always torments women of this type; they want their lovers under lock
        and key. They would like love itself to be a more substantial commodity,
        a thing that one could buy by the pound,
        and store in a safe or an ice-chest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Doubt and jealousy, those other hand-maidens of love, are also
        the children of imagination. But people wrongly use the word
        &quot;imagination&quot; to mean abstraction of ideas from concrete
        facts. And this is the reverse of the truth. Imagination makes ideas
        visible, clothes Being in form. It is, in short, very much like the
        &quot;faith&quot; of which Paul speaks. When true imagination makes true
        images of the Unseen, we have true love, and all true gods; when false
        imagination makes false images -- then come the idols, Moloch, Jahveh,
        Jaganath, and their kindred, attended by all shapes of vice, of crime,
        of misery.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Lisa was thinking, as she climbed the apparently unending
        staircase, that she had taken pretty long [135] odds. She had not
        hesitated to buck the Tiger, Life. Simon Iff had warned her that she was
        acting on impulse. But -- on the top of that -- he had merely urged her
        to be true to it. She swore once more that she would stick to her guns.
        The black mood fell from her. She turned and looked upon the sea, now
        far below. The sun, a hollow orb of molten glory, hung quivering in the
        mist of the Mediterranean; and Lisa entered for a moment into a perfect
        peace of spirit. She became one with Nature, instead of a being
        eternally at war with it.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But Cyril turned his face again to the mountain; she knew that he
        wanted to perform the evening adoration from the terrace of the house
        itself.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At last they came out from their narrow gangway to the by-street
        behind the church. It was an old and neglected thoroughfare, far from
        the main automobile road that runs along the crest. It was a place that
        the centuries had forgotten. Lisa realized that it was a haven of calm
        -- and in a sense she resented the fact. Her highly-coloured nature
        demanded constant stimulus. She was an emotion-fiend, if one may
        construct the term by analogy with another branch of pathology.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The lovers turned to the left through the village; in a few
        minutes the road opened, and they saw the villa before them. It stood on
        a spur of rock, separated from the main hill by a sharply-cut chasm.
        This was spanned by an old stone bridge, a flying arch set steeply from
        the road to the house. It almost gave the effect of a frozen cascade
        issuing from the great doorway.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril led Lisa across the bridge. This house was not served like
        that they had left behind them in Paris. Visitors were not expected or
        desired at any time, and the inmates rarely left the grounds, except on
        duty. [136]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was therefore some time before an answer to the summons
        reached them. Cyril's hand, dragging down an iron rope, had set swinging
        a great bell, deep and solemn, like a tocsin, in the turret which
        overlooked the chasm. Not until its last echo was dumb did a small Judas
        in the door slide back. Cyril held up his left hand, and showed his
        seal-ring. Immediately the door swung open; a man of fifty odd years of
        age, dressed in black, with a great sword, like his brother guard at the
        Profess-House in Paris, stood bowing before them.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I enter
        the house.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With these words Cyril Grey assumed possession. &quot;Lead me to
        Sister Clara.&quot; The man turned and went before them down a long
        corridor which opened upon a stone terrace, flagged with porphyry. A
        circular fountain in the middle had, for its centre a copy of the Venus
        Callipyge in black marble. The parapet was decorated with statues of
        satyrs, fauns, and nymphs.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The woman who came to meet them was assuredly kin to that ancient
        company. She was about forty years of age, robust and hardy, burnt dark
        with years of outdoor life, her face slightly pitted with smallpox, her
        eyes black, stern, and true. Her whole aspect and demeanour expressed
        devoting capacity and determination. It was she who ruled the house in
        the absence of Simon Iff.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A brief colloquy between this woman and Cyril Grey followed their
        first greetings, whose austere formality inexplicably conveyed the most
        cordial kindness. He explained that he wished her to continue in full
        control of the house, only modifying its rules so far as might be
        necessary for the success of a certain experiment in magick which he had
        come to carry out. Sister Clara acquiesced with the [137] slightest of
        nods; then she raised her voice, and summoned the others to the evening
        adoration of the Sun.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril performed this as leader; the duty done, he was free to
        meet his new brothers and sisters.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sister Clara was assisted by two young women, both of the slender
        willowy type -- rather babyish even, one might say, with their light
        brown fluffiness and their full, red soft lips. They remained standing
        apart from the men, who numbered five. First in rank came the burly
        Brother Onofrio, a man of some thirty-five years, strong as a bull, with
        every muscle like iron from constant physical toil. Two men of thirty
        stood beside him, and behind them two lads of about sixteen.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        They were all devoted -- so far as the outer world was aware --
        to the healing of humanity in respect of its physical ills. The men were
        doctors, or students, the women nurses; though in fact Sister Clara was
        herself the most brilliant of them all, a surgeon who could have held
        her own against any man in Europe.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But it was contrary to the rule of the house for any sick person
        to lodge there; the private hospital which was attached to it was
        situated some three hundred yards further back from the hillside.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At a glance Lisa perceived that she had come into a circle where
        discipline was the first consideration.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Every one moved as if a Prussian sergeant had been in charge of
        him from infancy. Every one looked as if his responsibility were ever
        present to his mind. These manners sat naturally enough upon Clara and
        Onofrio; on the others the idea was hardly yet assimilated. But there
        was no evidence of any outward constraint; even the youngest of the boys
        was proud to take himself so seriously as he did.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A touch of frost was in the air; Cyril led Lisa within. A special
        set of rooms had been prepared [138] for their reception; but Lisa was
        displeased to find that they had been arranged entirely with reference
        to feminine tastes and requirements. A single scheme of colour embraced
        the whole suite; white, blue and silver. The tapestries, the carpets,
        the very ceilings, were wholly in these and no other lights.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The pictures and statues were of Artemis, no other goddess; the
        very objects in the apartment were crescent shaped, and the only metal
        in evidence was silver. Where the crescent could not serve the purpose,
        the surfaces had been engraved with stars of nine points.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Only three books lay upon the table; they were the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Endymion</i> of Keats, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Atalanta
        in Calydon</i> of Swinburne, and one other. But in a small bookshelf
        were several other volumes; and Lisa found later that each one
        described, suggested, or had been more or less directly inspired by the
        moon. In a silver censer, too, burnt an incense whose predominating
        ingredient was camphor. Everything present was designed or chosen so
        that it might turn the girl's mind to the earth's satellite.
        Subsequently she discovered that this plan extended even to her diet --
        she was to live
        exclusively on those foods which wise men of old classified as lunar in
        nature, on account either of their inherent qualities, or because they
        are traditionally sacred to Diana.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After the beginning of the experiment, no male was to enter that
        apartment.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        She was a little frightened on grasping the fact that Cyril must
        have forseen her perfect compliance from the beginning. He noticed it
        with a slow smile, and began to explain to her why he had chosen the
        moon as the type of &quot;butterfly&quot; they were going to snare.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;The moon is the most powerful influence in your
        horoscope,&quot; he said. &quot;She stands, in her own sign Cancer, in
        the mid-heaven. The Sun and [139] Mercury are rising in square to her,
        which is not specially good; it may bring trouble of a certain kind; But
        Neptune is sextile to her, Jupiter and Venus trine. It is about as good
        a horoscope as one could hope for in such a case. The worst danger is
        the conjunction of Luna and Uranus -- they are much too close to be
        comfortable. My own nativity goes well with yours, for I am primarily
        solar by nature, though (Heaven knows!) Herschel in the ascendant
        modifies it; and so I make the complement to you. But I am not to
        influence you or associate with you too much. I shall sleep with the men
        in the square tower yonder, which is kept magically separate from the
        rest of the house. We shall all be working constantly to invoke the
        moon's influence and to keep off intruders. Sister Clara is egregiously
        powerful in work of this special kind; she has made a particular study
        of it for twenty years; and during the past ten she has never spoken to
        a man, except in strict necessity. Her pupils have taken a similar
        resolution. There is no question of vows, which imply self-distrust --
        fear of weakness and of vacillation; the women of our order execute
        their own wills, with no need of external pressure. Go thou and do
        likewise!&quot; Suddenly he had become stern and gloomy; and she felt
        how terrible would be his anger or contempt.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The morning broke brilliant; and Lisa found, not for the first
        time, that the most bracing influence resulted from the routine peculiar
        to the Profess-houses. To rise before dawn; to make a ceremonial
        ablution with the intention of so purifying both body and mind that they
        should be as it were new-born; then the joyous outburst of adoration as
        the sun rose to sight: this was a true Opening of the Day. Insensibly
        the years slipped from her; she became like a maiden in thought and in
        activity.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        About a week was to elapse before the new moon, [140] at the
        moment of which the operation was timed to commence; but it was a busy
        week for Cyril Grey. With Brother Onofrio, for whom he had taken an
        immense liking, he inspected every inch of the defences of the house. It
        was already a kind of fortress; the terraces were
        bounded by ramparts angled or rounded so as to suggest that
        old-fashioned pattern of military work of which Fort William in Calcutta
        is said to be the most perfect example.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the defence of which the magicians were thinking was of a
        different order; the problem was to convert the whole place as it stood
        into an impregnable magical circle. For years, of course, the place had
        been defended, but not as against its present dangers. It had been
        hitherto sufficient to exclude evil and ignorant beings, things of the
        same class as Douglas' watcher; but now a far more formidable problem
        was in view, how to dissuade a Soul, a being armed with the imperial
        right to enter, from approaching. Demons and elementals and
        intelligences were only fractions of true Entities, according to the
        theory; they were illusions, things merely three-dimensional, with no
        core of substance in themselves. In yet another figure, they were
        adjectives, and not nouns. But a human soul is a complete reality.
        &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        To repel one such from its demand to issue into the world of
        matter was a serious difficulty -- and, also, possibly involved no mean
        responsibility. However, Cyril's main hope was that any passing souls
        would be reasonable, and not try to force themselves into uncongenial
        company, or plant themselves in unsuitable soil. He had always held that
        incarnation was balked when the soul discovered that the heredity and
        environment of the embryo it had chosen were too hostile to allow the
        desired manifestation; the soul would then withdraw, with the physical
        result of [141] miscarriage, still-birth, or, where the embryo, deserted
        by the human soul, becomes open to the obsession of some other thing,
        such as a Vampire or what the Bible calls a &quot;dumb spirit,&quot; the
        production of monsters or idiots.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Cyril Grey, by insisting upon constant devotion to the human
        ideal, hoped to ward off all other types of soul, just as the presence
        of a pack of wolves would frighten away a lamb; and he further trusted
        to attract potent forces, who would serve as a kind of lighthouse to his
        harbour. He imagined his desired Moon-soul, afloat in space, vehemently
        spurred towards the choir of sympathetic intelligences whom it could
        hardly fail to perceive, by reason of the intensity of the concentration
        of the magical forces of the operators upon the human idea.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Two days before the beginning of the operation, a telegram from
        Paris reached him. It stated that, as he suspected, Balloch and Douglas
        were the forces behind the attack; further, that Grey's presence in
        Naples was known, and that three members of the Black Lodge had left
        Paris for Italy.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He thought it undesirable to communicate the news to Lisa.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But he renewed his general warnings to her.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Child!&quot; he said, &quot;you are now ready for our great
        experiment. On Monday, the day of the New Moon, you take the oath of
        dedication; and we shall be able to resume those relations which we
        temporarily renounced. Now let me say to you that you are absolutely
        guarded in every way but one. The weak spot is this: we cannot abolish
        unsuitable thoughts entirely from your mind. It is for you to do that,
        and we have done our best to make the conditions as favourable as
        possible; but I warn you that the struggle may be bitter. You will be
        amazed at the possibilities of your own mind, its fertility of [142]
        cunning, its fatally false logic, its power of blinding you to facts
        that ought to be as clear as daylight -- yes, even to the things before
        your very eyes. It will seek to bewilder you, to make you lose your
        mental balance -- every trick is possible. And you will be so beaten and
        so blind that you have only one safe -- guard; which is, to adhere
        desperately to the literal terms of your oath.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Do that, and in a little while the mind will clear; you
        will understand what empty phantoms they were that assailed you. But if
        you fail, your only standard is gone; the waters will swirl about you
        and carry you away to the abyss of madness. Above all, never distinguish
        between the spirit and the letter of your oath! The most exquisite
        deceit of the devil is to lure you from the plain meaning of words. So,
        though your instinct, and your reason,
        and your common sense, and your intelligence all urge you to interpret
        some duty otherwise than in the plain original sense; don't do it!&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;I don't see what you mean.&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Here's a case. Suppose you swore 'not to touch alcohol.'
        The devil would come with a sickness, and an alcholic medicine; he would
        tempt you to say that of course your oath didn't mean 'medicinally.' Or
        you would wish to rub your skin with eau-de-cologne; of course 'touch'
        really meant 'drink.'&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;And I should really be right to be stupidly literal, like
        that?&quot;
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &quot;Yes, in a case where the mind, being under a magical
        strain, becomes unfit to judge. It's the story of Bluebeard; only you
        must alter it so that the contents of the fatal chamber exist only in
        the woman's imagination, that she had so worked herself up by what she
        thought she might see that she also thought she saw it. So be on your
        guard!&quot; [143]
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        On the last day of the old moon he gave her an idea of the&nbsp;
        main programme.
        
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        First, the honeymoon; their normal relations were to endure until
        there was evidence of the need to emphasize the crucial point of the
        operation. From that moment she was to see nothing of Cyril save in the
        ceremonies of invocation; all other relations were to cease. The lover
        would become the hermit. The magician had calculated the probable moment
        of incarnation as about six months before the day of birth. Once it
        became certain that
        the soul had taken possession of the embryo, the hermit would become the
        elder brother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;It was clearly the middle period that was critical; not
        only because of the magical difficulties, but because Lisa herself would
        be under intense strain, and isolated from her lover's active sympathy.
        But Cyril thought it best to dare these dangers rather than to allow his
        own soul to influence her atmosphere, as his solar personality might
        possibly drive away the very &quot;butterfly&quot; which they wished to
        collect. In fact, his human individuality was one of the things that had
        to be banished from her neighbourhood. She must know nothing of him but
        the purely magical side, when, clothed in robes suitable to the
        invocations of Luna and with word and gesture concentrated wholly upon
        the work, he sank Cyril Grey utterly in the Priest of Artemis --
        &quot;thy shrine, thine oracle, thine heat of pale-mouthed prophet
        dreaming.&quot; [144]
