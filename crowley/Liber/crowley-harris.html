Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
Your secretary forgot to send the letter 
you wrote to me &amp; she has rung me up
to read it to me. I am, also, sorry that 
I have to write plainly to you, because I
enjoy our friendship &amp; your instruction 
very much, but it is entirely spoilt by
your attempts to use me as your bank &amp; 
financial adviser. I have frequently told
you that I have nothing, but a weekly 
allowance, &amp; that out of it I have given you
all I can spare.</p>
<p>
If you are expecting the Tarot to be a 
means of getting money, or my position
as useful for pushing it--I am sorry I am 
not the right vehicle for such an
enterprise as I intend to remain 
anonymous when the cards are shown as I
dislike any notoriety.</p>
<p>
Your books are wonderful but you must not 
expect the reading or money
making world to buy them as they don't 
want to think &amp; ...</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
Will you go to Le Chatier Sarve in St 
James Street and ask them if they can
mount my drawings in the same way as the 
ones you have as a sample. If it
would not bother you perhaps you could 
take one with you. Also please ask the
price. I have thought of Green &amp; Stone 
but they haven't any good assistants now
&amp; can't be trusted. There was a very good 
man on the left going down Pelham
Street, small shop with a few frames 
hanging up &amp; if he still exists he did some
fine framing &amp; mounting for Nick &amp; was 
not too dear, but I don't remember his
name. The Rowley Gallery in Church 
Street, Notting Hill Gate can do the work
but they are fussy &amp; very opinionated. I 
am particularly anxious to get the
drawings covered with a non inflammable 
talc of which the departed assistant at
Gates had the name. I wonder if you could 
extort from Blow-Bubbles what it was
called.</p>
<p>
I do not find the names of the Cards in 
the Index you have sent at all
illuminating in fact it took me hours to 
sort which was which. They are much too
flamboyant, &amp; I prefer the old names 
don't you. I hate all those rushing words &amp;
feel I've alighted in Taliesom. What am I 
to print in the surrounds, because I
won't do them wrong, it is very hard 
work.</p>
<p>
I have done the 10 of Swords &amp; promptly 
Russia takes up arms. Where are we
going! You haven't sent me the notes on 
the Fool. Did you no-tice.</p>
<p>
Have you seen that all the Sephiroths in 
the Index are spelled wrong, at least
nearly all--an awful bother if they get 
printed like that. Also I don't feel you have
made it clear about Tzaddi--The Emperor. 
Can't you have a diagram? I have
been reading your book to Ann Christie in 
the evenings &amp; altho she is very
interested she could not understand your 
book and I am not sure I did in the
end. It will be a point about which there 
will be the most argument. Is there any
reason for the 2 loops except secrecy? 
Surely! &amp; if not why not undo the loop &amp; is
the Emperor to be numbered 17 or IV or 4 
or 17 ditto Star also Strength XI and
Justice VIII. I expect I have still got 
it all wrong but if I have, you must be clearer
because I am only just below sub-normal 
intelligence. A bientot</p>

<p>
Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
The picture did not arrive because my 
friends at Woolstaplers Hall were away
&amp; the house shut up &amp; you know I have 
never lived there, &amp; when your letters
don't arrive it is because they are away 
&amp; there is no one to take in letters. It
would be much better to write to the 
above address. The picture has arrived
safely now. I have written to Michael 
Juste. Steptoe must have finished more
photographs as he sent me the account.</p>
<p>
I think I have found someone to continue 
stretching the pictures &amp; mounting
them at Leamington &amp; am going to see him 
on Sunday I hope. There is a lot of
work to be done on those mounts.</p>
<p>
I think it would be a good plan if you 
could arrange to come here one day next
week &amp; see the Swords. I have a 
superstitious horror of bringing them all
unbalanced to London.</p>
<p>
As it is, we are driven mad with soldiers 
here &amp; if I don't get on with the
Pantacles this will be a garrisson town 
(I know that is incorrectly spelt but I have
no dictionary &amp; the longer I look at it 
the more peculiar it looks).</p>
<p>
I find the pub &quot;The Noel Arms&quot; is quite 
nice. Would next Tuesday suit you.
There is a good train from Paddington 
1.45 arriving Chipping Campden 4.24 &amp; a
station bus to bring you from the 
station. You might like to stay Wednesday &amp;
return Thursday as they tell me, the 
rooms are not available at the week-end.
Please let me know at once if this is 
possible for you--I shall hope you will come
as my guest. I will send ticket if I can.</p>
<p>
I only hope the Swords are alright for I 
can't do them again.</p>
<p>
I have followed your instructions with 
meticulous care.</p>
<p>
About yr curtains. The ones at Whiteleys 
are much too small. Those windows
are enormous. If you need them Mr Blanche 
tells me she has seen some blankets
which will look alright. I have used them 
here instead of curtains &amp; find them
most cozy &amp; look quite nice. I do not 
want to buy curtains for that flat as I want
to give it up.</p>
<p>
I am doing the King of Pantacles. I 
didn't like what I had done. Someone has
lent me a genuine flail--it is like this </p>
<p>
[manuscript drawing of flail]</p>
<p>
a lovely instrument of solid wood. Most 
difficult to manage.</p>
<p>
Why don't you like my egg question. Is it 
because you don't know the answer?
I think it is interesting because the 
living egg must be charged with, let us call it,
electric current to make it move. To me 
it is a magical feat. I thought it would be
to you. There is no trick and it is the 
country people's method of testing eggs
here.</p>

<p>
Dear Aleister Mohammed,</p>
<p>
Princess &amp; Child doing well.<br>
I will try to answer your letter clearly.</p>
<p>
I. I have a diagram of the Twist of the 
Zodiac. Would you like me to make a
conventional diagram of your rough?</p>
<p>
II. Would you send your notes with a 
paper fastener {drawing] not a clip
[drawing] as the thing comes undone &amp; I 
can't put the papers in right order &amp; get
eyestrain?</p>
<p>
III. Alright about Hylton, have attended 
to it.</p>
<p>
IV. I sent that heading of the border as 
I was not certain it was right. I am not
sure what to do. I shall have to try 
again. Of course I can devide Wands &amp; Disks
so that they look dqually &amp; I don't want 
a crowd of printing at the bottom but I
will try out what you suggest. &quot;More work 
for the undertaker&quot; says I.</p>
<p>
V. In reference to your books--I suppose 
you know that most of them would
be easier for a Beginner written in 
Sanscrit &amp; that anyone reading them would go
off their heads. Therefore the Wise 
(&quot;like myself&quot;) take them in snappy bits &amp;
only when they are feeling strong. Also 
they are very exciting &amp; I can't live on
hot curry tho you can--I can't even 
remember what I meant by that Nanny Nanny
[?]. I'm glad I was unintelligible, such 
a change round for you, &amp; anyhow I don't
care for just look at the stucco work you 
have planned out for me--&quot;Push the
Cups deeper! Twist the whole card round&quot; 
Oh! but these things are all on 1 plane
&amp;, unless I start applique or sculpture, 
it can't be begun.</p>
<p>
However I knew we should have to do 
something, &amp; as far as the paper, the
texture, the design, will endure I will 
do as you say. I will also do a new Justice,
damn her. Do you think there was ever &quot;a 
woman satisfied&quot;? With what a smirk
she would greet the dawn. But, all the 
same, I want to finish all the experimental
work first, tho Mercury is yelling to 
re-enter the Womb &amp; Incarnate with his
Companions. I mean to plod thro the 
Pantacles &amp; the Universe, &amp; by that time,
you'll be able to alter all the Cards &amp; 
have them in &amp; out of costly frames &amp; we
will finish like Alice through the 
Looking Glass by having the whole pack on our
heads. Goodnight.</p>

<p>
Dear Frieda,</p>
<p>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of 
the law.</p>
<p>
Benediction arrived this morning arrived 
from Father Jackson. I am very
happy and grateful.</p>
<p>
I was going to send you a classic of 
purity, but I have not yet been able to get
the special copy that I had intended for 
you. I have been terrifically worried. I
have not had a word from Germer since his 
letter of November 30th, and this is
very unusual. Normally, I hear at least 
once, more often twice a week. This has
meant continuous anxiety and frustration.</p>
<p>
My characteristic idiocy has just been 
giving another demonstration. I have
been wondering for a week why it hurt to 
carry coal upstairs, and it only
dawned upon me last night that it was 
lumbago, so I then turned on the infra-red
and it was all right in half an hour. 
This is a very strange thing about me;
something goes wrong, which is perfectly 
familiar, and I know the remedy quite
well, and I am simply unable to put two 
and two together. I don't know why that
is. A very queer psychological kink.</p>
<p>
Now your letters received yesterday. Your 
paragraph 1. Yes, please make a
conventional diagram.</p>
<p>
Your paragraph 2. I cannot accept your 
terminology for either of the
unsatisfactory instruments occasionally 
employed for keeping papers together. I
have acted however, on the indications 
afforded by your sketches. Freud would
deduce a great deal from your preference.</p>
<p>
Your paragraph 3. Thanks very much about 
Hylton.</p>
<p>
Your paragraph 4. The word &quot;divide&quot; has 
for many years been years been
used by myself in preference to what is 
no doubt the correct expression
&quot;devide&quot;. I know of course that division 
can be done in this lop-sided fashion,
but I do not like the spoiling of the 
winged globe in any case, an an even more
serious objection is that you are making 
particularly shadowy the one thing that
should, by rights, be the most clear.</p>
<p>
Your paragraph 5. You can't get out of it 
like that. I believe the basis of the
feeling is that there should be a special 
prerogative to understand spiritual
matters, a feeling of heirship. The fact 
remains that you do not employ such
arrogant impertinence with regard to such 
subjects as logic and mathematics.
Bertrand Russell is certainly a thousand 
times more difficult than ever I am, but
you understand him better because you 
accept the postulate, that subjects like
these must be worked at, as with me you 
are annoyed.</p>
<p>
My experience of satisfied women is that 
they do greet the dawn with a smirk;
if not the dawn, any time up to five 
o'clock in the afternoon, and only when it
wears off does one have to start all over 
again.</p>
<p>
I have long foreseen the &quot;Alice in 
Wonderland&quot; conclusion of our labours, but
that if you remember was the signal for 
the awakening to the beauty of life.</p>
<p>
I got the photographs with great joy. I 
do not remember the colours of the
Three of Swords, but the centre of the 
rose should be deep crimson, and the
veins of the petals black and very wavy. 
Ten of Cups. This is admirable, but I
can't tell much about the background; it 
ought to look menacing. There is
something very sinister about this card. 
It suggests the morbid hunger which
springs from surfeit. The craving of a 
drug addict is the idea. At the same time,
of course, it is this final agony of 
descent into illusion which renders necessary
the completion of the circle by awakening 
the Eld of the All-Father.</p>
<p>
These notes on Justice, or as we have 
preferred to call her 'Adjustment'. Please
note this title. In reading through my 
description of the card, I noticed a
correction to be made, Phalax should be 
Phallic. There are several mistakes in
spelling and punctuation, but no doubt 
you can put these right by your own
ingenium. I suppose I was in a very bad 
temper when I made my criticism, but I
do feel strongly that the plumes of Maat 
are too insignificant, and the Dove and
Raven look simply stuck on; nor do I 
think that the tessellated pavement is quite
right. The general criticism is that the 
card is a little too cold; Liber is the sign of
autumn, season of mists and mellow 
fruitfulness, close-bosomed friend of the
maturing sun. In your card you have got 
the idea of balance static, whereas it
ought to be dynamic. Nature is not the 
grocer weighing out a pound of sugar; it
is the compensation of complicated 
rhythms. I should like you to feel that every
adjustment was a grande passion; 
compensation should be a festival, not a clerk
smugly pleased that his accounts are 
correct. It seems to me that this doctrine is
very important as a commentary on the 
text &quot;Existence is pure joy&quot;, and I feel
sure that the connection of Venus and 
Saturn with the sign is significant in this
respect. The compensation is surely the 
awakening of the Eld of the All-Father, the constant reproduction of the 
original purity from the last stage of
illusion. (Compare what I said above 
about the number Ten).</p>
<p>
What an extraordinary thing to say! To 
retain one card may be different from
all the other cards. The great difficulty 
of this whole work is to make a
completely harmonious pack; that is why I 
wrote so strongly about the private
Private View.</p>
<p>
Your feeling about having no forms and 
faces is merely symptomatic of
modern soul-sickness. It is lack of 
confidence in one's creative powers. It is the
root of homo-sexuality as understood in 
this country and of all these crazy
movements, the Neo-Thomists, and the 
Buchmanites and the Dadaists and the
Surrealists. Picasso took it far enough; 
he tried to paint a chair which could not
be any particular chair, and must 
therefore have no colour and no form, but as
every chair, in order to be a chair, must 
have a support for the human frame, he
did a horizontal line. But this is 
metaphysics and not art; all these half-sexed,
half-witted people, sicklied o'er with the 
pale caste of thought, I cannot believe that
any of them will ever command either the 
Exeter, the Ajax or the Achilles, and
any man who is not potentially capable of 
doing that, is not a man at all; he may
be some kind of pudding, and I hold no 
brief against puddings, but all these
people who resent simplicity resent 
manhood, they weave their own onanistic
web of nastiness; these are the shells 
cast off from the Tree of Life, these are the
larvea of abomination. It has been your 
evil fortune to have far too much to do
with such people without a proper 
clinical training, such as would have enabled
you to diagnose their malady; they have 
small orts of cleverness without any
breadth of vision or balance, without the 
sense of space, of nature, of fresh air.
Their fiddling little ingenuities appeal 
to you rather as a chess problem or a jigsaw
puzzle appeals to some of us in moments 
of idleness, but you did not have
the psychological and pathological 
knowledge to keep you from making the
fatal false step over the precipice of 
common sense; you have taken these
abortive insects seriously. It is 
perfectly true in one sense to say that the only
thing to be done is to fill up some 
stupid official paper correctly, but that is only
true within the universe of discord of 
that paper, and the belief in thee artificial
ingenuities is liable to become a 
nightmare, and that is when you do have to say
&quot;It's nothing but a pack of cards.&quot;</p>
<p>
The whole world as I see it is at present 
lost in constipations of this kind; the
real needs of humanity are what they have 
always been, food, shelter, love and
freedom. That, roughly speaking, is the 
general true will of the species, and all
devices, which are not subservient to 
this will, are errors.</p>
<p>
To return to `Adjustment'; those birds 
bother me very much. I don't think they
belong. I think they come from Noah's 
Ark. It would be better to simplify this
card by leaving them out altogether. I 
feel sure that when you get the Venus and
Saturn dancing motive firmly in your 
mind, you will produce a lady whom you
will like better.</p>
<p>
I must emphasise that this fear of faces 
is an appalling symptom of cowardice.
It is surely a natural instinct to 
connect expression with moral ideas, and it is
moral ideas, or more correctly magical 
ideas, that you are out to illustrate. It did
not matter so much in this particular 
card because of the tradition of Justice
being blind, but on the other hand, the 
masking of the face suggests deceit which
is the absolute opposite of the intention 
of the card; it was the familiars of the
Inquisition, it was the Vehngericht that 
administered what they called Justice,
hooded. Impartiality is a lovely idea, 
but it doesn't get you very far; if the
impartial person may be impersonated by a 
demon of malignant darkness.</p>
<p>
I will now try to do you something about 
Mohammed.</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
The 26 cards have gone to be mounted, so 
we are beginning to be terrifyingly
finished. There are several I should like 
to try again, but none of them are what I
have hoped to be able to do. Therefore 
tonight I am the victim of the most
profound hump, and I think in future I 
had better stick to mechanical typing.
Also I have been reading your truly 
magical Liber L.X.V. Oh no, I do not pretend
to apprehend it, only it is like music, 
and the only kind of writing I want to read,
only it makes me feel as if I lived in a 
desert and I am mighty thirsty. Shall I
never get on a bit? Yoga practices I 
never seem to advance in. I cannot live more
quietly, but even then the business of 
living takes time. I am positively alarmed
at the prospect of the end of this work, 
as if I do not get any more handed to me,
I shall have to return to the awful life 
I have escaped from in my conscience
during the last 2 years, and I doubt if I 
can. I do not think the ritual of Magic is
much good to me, I seem to have to draw 
everything I want to understand.
Thank you beyond words for all your help 
patience and understanding. At any
rate, thanks to that, you have penetrated 
a slight amount and in the far distance I
can see a bit what the Wisdom of the past 
and the present might mean. I do wish
I could do better, I feel like a lump of 
undigested suet. </p>
<p>
No. 2 Disks is on the stocks, is the 
serpent's eye to be red? It is a bit awkward,
as there are several colours introduced 
in that card which do not belong to
Jupiter and Capricorn, I mean the 4 
element colours and they make
inharmonious patches. Did you say 
anything about jewels on the serpent? I think
you will like him. The vile lettering 
will have to start again, it makes me cross
and ache all over.</p>
<p>
I am longing to have a go at Mercury, but 
I am determined to do the Universe
first. I have told the man not [to] 
fasten any cards in the frames, so we can look at
them very carefully, it will be awful, 
but I must get them as nearly right as I can,
tho the bother is that watercolours are 
the devil to alter, even if I were sure that
the addition was going to fit in with the 
design, and altho I can redo, it is not
possible to regain the memory of the 
emotion and one tends to produce a bad
copy.</p>

<p>
Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
Thank you for your letter.</p>
<p>
The No. 5 is also done.</p>
<p>
About the Stafford Galleries. I think the 
best way of handling Ala Story will be
for me to invite her for the weekend, 
show her the cards &amp; let the suggestion that
she should show them come from her. Percy 
has offered to drive her down &amp; it
was all fixed up, when she developed a 
cold &amp; could not come. She is an erratic
cove &amp; from long experience of her I am 
sure she is more likely to function if she
is allowed to think she is the originator 
of any business scheme. In spite of her
alluring manners she is fundamentally a 
very capable business woman &amp; she
won't be persuaded to do anything that 
will not mean publicity or money.</p>
<p>
There is one more thing--I do not think 
those cards will sell if you include any
sort of ritual. People generally are 
afraid of being made fools of, getting bad luck
by associating with black magic, 
especially at these times, when all the world is
crossing itself to avert the evil eye, &amp; 
the secular business man, whose money
you need if the cards are to be 
reproduced, simply will not touch anything in the
nature of a stunt for fear of offending 
his general public.</p>
<p>
I humbly suggest that we let Ala 
advertise it in her own way, keeping very
much in the background, for my part 
anonymously &amp; so stimulate the curiousity
of the public &amp; the critics. The whole 
production will be unusual enough to
make a mark, that is if I have done my 
part well enough, &amp; I have observed that
a well staged mystery is a magic of great 
value in attracting attention. I would
even like to suggest that you do not sign 
your work either. To those, who know
your lucid prose &amp; classic style, it will 
be unmistakable, to the general public, it
will be taken as a shock, but, without 
the suspicion that you, Aleister Crowley,
are either attempting to pull their leg 
or poisoning them with some dangerous
new creed in the attempt to raise funds 
or the wind. In my case I should be
acused of trying to learn them, &amp; anyhow 
why should we respect this insane art
when &quot;Percy Harris ought to have the poor 
thing locked up, he can afford it, only
he is too mean.&quot;</p>
<p>
THE WEATHER. I don't find it too bad. It 
is really lovely to look at. The trees
are incased in ice, I have never seen 
anything like it, &amp; living &amp; walking,
everything ordinary has assumed a rare &amp; 
dignified aspect with the elements
completely out of control. Also, the 
howling wind, &amp; this new invention &quot;icisny&quot;
which is neither raining or snowing, 
keeps everyone away, so I can read, paint,
or cook to my entire satisfaction, also 
slither up &amp; down the
ladder to my studio which provides the 
necessary exercise &amp; danger to stimulate
me &amp; keep me warm.</p>
<p>
But it is much too cold for you to brave 
the train, also I am not quite ready to
show enough work I should like to have 
the Universe done first, so I shall stop &amp;
take another brood on it.</p>
<p>
The still life I sent you is the favorite 
&quot;eat&quot; of the Cotswold. I ate mine after

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
The 26 cards have gone to be mounted, so 
we are beginning to be terrifyingly
finished. There are several I should like 
to try again, but none of them are what I
have hoped to be able to do. Therefore 
tonight I am the victim of the most
profound hump, and I think in future I 
had better stick to mechanical typing.
Also I have been reading your truly 
magical Liber L.X.V. Oh no, I do not pretend
to apprehend it, only it is like music, 
and the only kind of writing I want to read,
only it makes me feel as if I lived in a 
desert and I am mighty thirsty. Shall I
never get on a bit? Yoga practices I 
never seem to advance in. I cannot live more
quietly, but even then the business of 
living takes time. I am positively alarmed

The Winged Beetle is at Felix Cross'. I

Now about the Exhibition.</p>
<p>
Mercury is evidently wishing to hold it--</p>
<p>
Nicholson, Venn High Street Oxford have 
offered me their Gallery. I have
taken it &amp; am going there on Monday to 
see them.</p>
<p>
I found a most superb leaflet advertising 
an illuminated book called the
Haggadah selling at [L]100 &amp; brought out 
by the Beaconsfield Press. I was so
impressed by it that I went to London to 
see them &amp; found the work was done
by the Sun Engraving Co. who were able &amp; 
wishful to print the cards and the
book, but at a price!!!!</p>
<p>
Since then I have received many 
suggestions, impossible to write to you such
vague ideas, but the Exhibition may help 
the cards to sell or subscribers may be
found to finance the publication.</p>
<p>
Now then, I must come &amp; see you, there 
are matters that I must discuss with
you, not write them.</p>
<p>
I have had an invitation printed for the 
General Public, just a card which is at
the printers (I have put no name for the 
artist, I don't want to, something informs
me that I am lost if I take credit or 
publicity in designing the cards as an artist).
Please understand this, no one else can.</p>
<p>
The catalogue will be sent direct to you 
but it will be expensive &amp; if we make
more than 10% alterations in the proof, 
it will have to be paid for again.</p>
<p>
I have had a wrapper for the catalogue 
made by the Sun Engraving Co. This
will be beautifully printed with the 
Magician reproduced perfectly as a card, the
right size &amp; engraved on it. This will be 
on the catalogues to be sent out to
anyone likely to [be] &amp; charged 2/6 for 
at the Show. The block for this was so
dear that I had to have the Catalogue 
done more cleaply elsewhere.</p>
<p>
I have seen Houghton &amp; I will tell you 
what he said.</p>
<p>
Please stay at Torquay. I shall be in 
London &amp; Oxford till I come on to you &amp; I
can't stay with you, as I must come back 
&amp; get on
as you will see--I will telegraph but I 
expect to get to you on Wednesday
evening, if I can collect the Catalogue 
proof &amp; the 4 princes by then. </p>
<p>
The alteration of Abracadabra 
(Charioteer) &amp; the Taurus Disk card are
complete.</p>
<p>
Please forgive this brief statement, it 
is because I know you are so lucid and
logical that I can write &amp; tell you I 
have taken such arbitrary action without
consulting you as you will realize this

I am so sorry for all your troubles. We 
are both getting too excited &amp; it attacks

lose my head &amp; you your breath. I am
sending you [L]6: I don't know how but I

I have only just got your letters

stuffy railway carriages. Nick was worth 
it &amp; I had a view of a destroyer.</p>
<p>
But I called in at Oxford on the way home 
&amp; wrote 20 letters with
Ettinghausen. He is splendid and makes 
new suggestions every minute. Only
we must tread very cautiously. It makes 
me nervous but I mean to do what I can
to pull this off &amp; how we will sit back 
if only we can interest a few people who
will put up some money. That is the 
object of this show &amp; we must act entirely
for this so do trust me, I feel this is 
an election &amp; I have my hand on the popular
pulse &amp; Horus is the candidate. I am 
working 16 hours a day, writing, &amp; thinking
&amp; I go to Oxford on Monday to meet the 
Vogue representatives &amp; I hope a few of
the Press &amp; try to rope some in.</p>
<p>
Please forgive me if I do not write as 
often as you expect. I am really working
at high pressure, there is a lot of 
social smiling to be done &amp; keeping people in a
good temper, the travelling to &amp; fro is 
difficult &amp; I write all the time I am in the
train if I have time.</p>

My Dear Aleister--</p>
<p>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

<p>
I have just received your letter. It is a 
bit of a bomb that you are evicted. So
difficult &amp; tiring for you.</p>
<p>
Now then--you have always asked me to 
tell you the truth &amp; I am writing a
truth to you which I find difficult to 
convey delicately but I must do so.</p>
<p>
The opposition against you in Oxford is 
very strong. My business is to get
money to publish these cards if possible 
&amp; this is nearly impossible in the
present war-condition. I have been 
successful thro using what influence I
possess in getting at people with money 
to come &amp; see the Exhibition. This is
using my social position foully. If they 
suspected that the cards were inspired by
the Arch Magician of Black Magic (what do 
they mean?) they would withdraw
their patronage. I have had this conveyed 
to me politely &amp; impolitely. Therefore
if you come to the Private View or show 
up in any prominence this attempt to
launch the cards is doomed &amp; all the work 
&amp; money lost. Can you be so largeminded
&amp; detached as to keep away until the 
thing is launched--If you court
notoriety, it is sure to appear 
ultimately that you are the source because so many
people know it &amp; I am really afraid of 
the avalanche which will fall on me. </p>
<p>
I am trying to keep out too because I am 
bored by occult people, loathe
commercialism, do not want fame or 
notoriety, do not want money, but yearn,
long, desire for solitude. Any financial 
success will be yours. I have had my
reward in the work.</p>

Now my honoured, esteemed colleague, 
reply to me &amp; trust me--</p>

<p>
1. It's lovely paper.</p>
<p>
2. The type looks very nice.</p>
<p>
3. The price is not outrageous but surely 
the size, if you mean to put the book
in with the cards, is too big. Perhaps 
you mean to publish without, in which case
I think you should at least have the 
photographs of the cards reproduced don't
you think?</p>

I enclose a cutting from the Evesham

<p>
I am having a funny time with the Show, 
very stuffy old ladies &amp; very ancient
men. But the children! I don't 
understand, they crowd in after school. I must have
had at least 8 little boys today &amp; they 
ask intelligent questions &amp; go solemnly
round &amp; stare. I have amused myself with 
asking them which one they liked. Oh
yes! they know at once &amp; generally I find 
it is the picture which fits with the
month in which they have been born. But 
one little boy aged 6, a little gnomelike
person obstinately declared for the Aeon. 
I tried to move him but he clung
to it--. What chord did it strike in him? 
Those clear eyes looked so gravely at me.</p>
<p>
&quot;I walked home with a gold dark boy<br>
And never a word I'd say<br>
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br>
Had taken my speech away</p>
<p>
I gazed entranced upon his face<br>
Fairer than any flower<br>
O shining Popocatapetl<br>
It was thy magic hour</p>
<p>
The houses, people, traffic seemed<br>
Thin fading dreams by day,<br>
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br>
Had stolen my soul away.&quot;</p>
<p>
Also a little person aged 2, scuttling &amp; 
crawling, was asked
which picture: Straight she went to No 2. 
Cups, Love. I though she would forget
&amp; asked her again 10 minutes later &amp; she 
toddled off to the same picture. &quot;That&quot;
she said again.</p>
<p>
Then they asked me &quot;What is the meaning 
of `Lust'.&quot; That's a knockout blow
for a poor adult.</p>
<p>
So somewhat timorously I said &quot;Well you 
must understand the feeling of it.
Now how do you feel if you see nice 
chocolates &amp; there, you get them &amp; how
good they taste. That is a picture of how 
you feel about those chocolates.&quot; And
then we had a lovely conversation about 
our favorite sweets &amp; yum yum over
sticky toffee &amp; the sweets that took 
longest to suck. But such concentration, how I
envied them.</p>
<p>
I will try to send you Sol in Aries 
picture. [?] Mercury is photographed but do
I know I like him. We shall tell when we 
see the photographs but all these
reproducers are constipated. Where are 
the 2 new cards from the Sun--Oh dear!</p>

I have written to Pearson to ask him to

have been trying to get from the Sun

This includes boxes &amp; any additional

<p>
Dear Mr. Pearson,</p>
<p>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of 
the Law.</p>
<p>
Thank you for your letter received this 
morning. In view of future relations I
think it of the utmost importance that I 
should make the situation clear to you. I
should have preferred to do this by word 
of mouth; and yet perhaps a letter
may, in the long run, serve the purpose 
better.</p>
<p>
As you know, odd cards have been 
reproduced by you as funds became
available.</p>
<p>
My very old and very dear friend Mr. 
Hylton was good enough to send me
[L]15.-.- for the purpose of producing 
one more trump, but on discovering that
two could be done for an extra [L]5.-.- 
or a little less, I sent you the additional
amount out of my own pocket.</p>
<p>
Lady Harris, naturally, accepted this 
enthusiastically, and sent you the
originals necessary.</p>
<p>
Let me say in parenthesis that one of the 
principal points in wishing this to be
done was that a friend of mine, who is 
proposing to finance the entire
production, wanted to see one of the 
smaller cards, so that he might feel sure
that they would stand up to the trumps.</p>
<p>
The next thing is that, to my amazement, 
I received a letter from Lady Harris,
including the following passage:--</p>
<p>
&quot;I am concerned at this part payment and 
buying single blocks. It is not a
good proposition because the question 
arises is the new block the property of
Hylton, yours or mine or whose?</p>
<p>
I foresee great complications &amp; would 
suggest we should have a third party
to whom all subscriptions should be paid, 
even if it means forming a limited
Tarot Co. with a treasurer.</p>
<p>
How would Madge Porter do if I could get 
her to take it on?</p>
<p>
If you don't like that idea--would Hylton 
do it or Cecil. You and I with the
possible chance of profits (I don't 
think) should not be recipients of casual
cheques or we shall soon be accused of 
embezzling same.&quot;</p>
<p>
Lady Harris never reads my letters 
carefully. I had told here that these blocks
were a present to us.</p>
<p>
Madge Porter is a dear little old lady, 
who lives in a remote cottage in a wood
some distance from Newbury. She is only 
approachable by a cart-track through
the wood, and has no telephone.</p>
<p>
I wrote to Lady Harris explaining the 
situation and then
received the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;May 14, 1942</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;My dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of 
the Law.</p>
<p>
I am sorry I cannot allow my pictures to 
be reproduced as a pack of cards
unless I know who the person is who is 
putting down the money, the exact
details of your plan and how you propose 
to raise so large a sum and am
satisfied that the securities are real

<p>
As all this fuss and worry is too much

business agreements to experts.</p>
<p>
I shall not reply to you again about them 
or discuss them with you.</p>
<p>
Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Yours,</p>
	<p>Frieda Harris&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If only she would have stuck to that! But 
instead of leaving things to her
Manager, she takes away the originals 
from you. I suppose that you had already
started work on the two cards. I can well 
understand your annoyance.</p>
<p>
I should like to emphasise that I am 
absolutely devoted to Lady Harris, and
have the evidence of countless acts of 
kindness on her part, indicating that her
feelings toward me are similar.</p>
<p>
But from time to time she is subject to 
fits of panic in which she does the most
incomprehensible things. For instance, 
she writes to people who are perfect
strangers to her with the object of 
interfering with their relations with me. I do
not wish to quote incidents, but I assure 
you that the facts are astounding.</p>
<p>
To recur to the present situation. In the 
first place, I have a two-thirds interest
in this work on the Tarot. As to the 
cards themselves, in nearly every case she
has done her painting from sketches made 
by me, and in every case the design
and meaning of the card and the 
particular colours to be used have been entirely
my work. There has been no cause of 
dispute. In fact, she has been most docile in
adapting herself to my requirements; in 
some cases I have made her do the card
over again as many as six or seven times.</p>
<p>
There is no reason whatever why she 
should go back on the proposition to
reproduce these two cards. You told me 
that her reason was that she though four
should have been reproduced at once. But 
in that case why not tell me? I should
gladly have put up the additional money 
required.</p>
<p>
I am sorry to have had to write to you at 
such length, about what is, after all,
nothing at all; and I daresay that you 
were quite right in suggesting to me over
the telephone that if she were left alone 
she would come to her senses.</p>
<p>
But the point at issue is this: I cannot 
possibly ask my friend
to put up [L]1600 if at any moment she is 
liable to dash in on an impulse and
whisk the originals away!</p>
<p>
For this reason, I am going to ask my 
solicitors, Messrs. Gisborne &amp; Lewis, 10
Ely Place, W.1., to draw up a proper 
business Contract, which will make it
impossible for her to interfere with the 
work, once the financial arrangements
with my friend are completed.</p>
<p>
Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Yours sincerely</p>
	<p>Aleister Crowley</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[P.S.] It seems important that you should 
understand my motive. To me this
Work on the Tarot is an Encyclopoedia of 
all serious &quot;occult&quot; philosophy. It is a
standard Book of Reference, which will 
determine the entire course of mystical
and magical thought for the next 2000 
years. My one anxiety is that it should be
saved from danger of destruction, by 
being reproduced in permanent form, and
distributed in as many distant places as 
may be. I am not anxious to profit
financially; if I had the capital 
available in this country, I should send (say) 200
copies to State Libraries in all parts of 
the world, and as many more to my
principal representatives.</p>

I will do some work on it &amp; you will 
judge.</p>
<p>
The Adjustment is being queer with me. 
She has, after all, insisted on being
Beardsley! Also Harlequin comes in &amp; out 
of it so I must have to submit. But
why Harlequin? Is there any connection? 
Also she won't sit down but stands on
her toes just balanced. The design-result 
is good. That blue is cobalt I take it. The
instruction says Blue-Blue green. Pale 
green Emerald. That Emerald is a vile
pigment in poster paints.</p>
<p>
I like the idea of a weekly letter on the 
Chinese Yi. Also as told to an idiot
appeals to me &amp; is frightfully good for 
you.</p>
<p>
I feel I am on the move. The back of the 
Card will be done next &amp; the reprinting
of mount.</p>
<p>
What about the enlarged set of replicas. 
A big work but it can be done.</p>
<p>
I have sent you only 1 throw-out in order 
that you should not become parcelbound.
You can have more.</p>
<p>
I am so glad you are a bit better but I 
do think those bouts of asthma must
exhaust you.</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
Thank you for your letter I will reply 
later to that.</p>
<p>
I am sending you a sample of the top of 
the surround of the card as I have
written &quot;Swords&quot; at the top. I find 
people cannot tell Trumps from Swords or
Cups from Disks so I propose to write 
Swords, Cups, Disks, Wands, Trumps at
the top. Owing to the black out I think 
this particular sample Swords is too dark
it should be the same colour as the mount 
not to show so much. I may be able to
wash it down but I have to horde [sic] 
this mount as I can't get any more--please
return this one.</p>
<p>
I have done as you suggested to the 
Swords. Thank you &quot;Mr Crowley&quot;. You
were quite right.</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I have been struggling with a bad cold &amp; 
the Lovers--the latter begins to cheer
up. I haven't decided whether I'll come 
back &amp; brood on the Fool or stay here. It
depends on the crisis, the Austrian 
Servants but I'd rather stay here.</p>
<p>
Can you tell me where there are 92 
elements according to the Russian
Mendelkeef (is it)? Also what do you know 
about Lilith. I can't find out anything
&amp; believe I asked you before &amp; you would 
not attend to me. I can't make
anything of the no 92. That is why I ask 
you.</p>
<p>
I hope you are all right.</p>

The caravan is a great success. Most

Your explanation of Lilith is not enough. 
She is a piebald wench &amp; not to be

I will struggle with the Fool. He does 
writhe about. I can't see him. Has he got
any children with him &amp; is not his bag a

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I hope you are alright. I don't think you 
were at all lucid about Lilith or the
100 years dead Russian however I hope you 
were preoccupied with writing. I
have been looking at Tao Teh King. Yes it 
is an excellent book &amp; like everything
you write, only could have been done by 
you &amp; a most profound &amp; lucid bit of
thought. No wonder you function so vilely 
on the living plane?</p>
<p>
I am grappling with the Fool which 
continues to give me a gad foot so that I
can't walk except in a club-footed heavy 
way. Also the caravan is fiercely cold &amp;
presents many obstacles. I have a studio 
also fiercely cold &amp; without any
furniture except packing cases, but that 
is a help. Directly the Fool is in a form to
be submitted to the Right Worshipable 
Master, I will return to the Petrolitis in
which we all endure.</p>

I do hope it is going to come out, I am

still &amp; I do hope it is going to be 
alright &amp; you'll be satisfied. I can't do it well
enough--every sort of obstacles, damp 
weather, intense cold, an impossible
situation of living in a caravan in 
mid-winter. I am more than duty [sic] but I
dare not leave as I must do this as well 
as I can without interruption &amp; I can hear
the rumblings of a tumultuous world 
through the apple trees. If only it is alright.
It has got all the symbols only I've 
never seen any traditional card like it &amp; it has

Dear Kerman,</p>
<p>
The Tarot is an Atlas of, and Guide Book 
to, the Universe. It has been my
daily study since Feb. '99, and my 
researches have cost me several thousand
pounds.</p>
<p>
I have long determined to construct a 
pack embodying all the new knowledge
gained from Anthropology, Comparative 
Religion, &amp; so forth.</p>
<p>
Lady Harris offered to execute the cards 
from my designs. It was agreed that I
should have a 2/3 share in the venture.</p>
<p>
From my rough sketches &amp; descriptions, 
under my continual inspection,
subject to my constant correction--I made 
her do some cards over again 5, 6 even
8 times in one case--she made the set now 
on show at the Berkeley Galleries.
(There is one exception: the card 
numbered I was not shown to, or authorized by,
me. I suspect a trick in this.)</p>
<p>
She has damaged the property by offering 
it for sale at cost price, thus
alienating the libraries &amp; booksellers, 
and reducing my 2/3 interest to nil.</p>
<p>
I value the copyright at something like 
[L]20000. (A crude, vilely drawn &amp;
coloured, ignorant, inferior pack, 
published in 1902 or thereabouts, has sold over
1000 copies every year since then at 15/- 
a copy. I am quite sure that these
admirable cards, with my book on the 
subject, which was to go with them in an
ornamental box, would bring in far more 
annual receipts. I have a large
following in U.S.A.--they send me [L]50 a 
month or more--which is growing
rapidly. Especially now my &quot;Hymn for 
Independence Day&quot; has been set to
music, and will be broadcast by the 
Cultural Garden League of Cleveland, Ohio,
on Aug. 9. There is also my Free French 
song (proof enclosed). And the invention
of the V-sign will ultimately benefit my 
work.</p>
<p>
I want first to establish my 2/3 claim in 
the copyright. Secondly, my
controlling interest in the cards 
themselves. If necessary, damages for her sly,
underhand, sneaking, dishonourable and 
dishonest action in giving this show
without my approval, and destroying the 
whole value of the copyright.</p>
<p>
N.B. The property right is actually 
vested in the O.T.O. (Mr. Karl Germer 1007
Lexington Avenue New York City is my 
Grand Treasurer General, and we had
perhaps better sue in his name.</p>
<p>
N.B. Lady H's real motive is to conceal 
her 4 years' close association with me!
Rather silly, then, to provoke a lawsuit!</p>
<p>
I shall ring up Saturday A.M. early: 
perhaps you could lunch with me.</p>

tried; don't do anything until I see you again.

In reply to [yours of] Sept. 2nd received 
2nd post today</p>
<p>
Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I think we should find it easier &amp; 
prevent any friction for us all, if this Miss
Lopham, Lopham, Backett, Gill Chancery, 
Staple Inn Holborn acts for me. I have
written to her to communicate with you at 
once &amp; I think you will find it a great
assistance to you as you are not well, if 
she consults with you &amp; puts us all wise
on the legal aspect &amp; can interview 
Houghton for you. You can always telephone
to her. She is very sensible &amp; knows my 
wishes &amp; has already met Houghton &amp;
been to Museum Street.</p>
<p>
I hope you will find this satisfactory &amp; 
will help you with the responsibility.</p>
<p>
I can always come up to London but as I 
am not a business-woman, I am more likely to be obstinate 
in the wrong place than an indifferent
outsider, &amp; if the contract is not 
carefully watched, one of us will be accused of
unfairness, so I think you will agree 
this will protect us both.</p>
<p>
I do wish you were better.</p>
<p>
You say &quot;I propose to arrange the terms 
of the contract with Mike (you don't
mention this at all, by the way, tho you 
should have got my letter last Friday by
the first post) so that (a) you are 
relieved from the curse of the stipend (b) that I
am enabled to see the job thru myself--I 
feel sure that London is the place.&quot;</p>
<p>
1. I never received a letter saying you 
proposed to arrange the terms of the
contract.</p>
<p>
2. I have never complained of the stipend 
as you have always given me so
much in return.</p>
<p>
3. I don't know what you mean about 
&quot;London is the place.&quot;</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I am sorry I have disgruntled you. If you 
mean the experience of moving
furniture I have a very varied one!</p>
<p>
I am working hard, have done No 10 &amp; No 9 
Swords &amp; nearly No 6.
I get frightfully stiff what a bore. Also 
I'm reading hard books I've had no time
for. This is a blessed relief, I hope 
I'll be able to stay here &amp; catch up a bit.</p>
<p>
Now about Locke. Shall I write to him?</p>
<p>
There is this curious old Rabbi, a

He wants to get a little work.</p>
<p>
&quot;He is a deep student of Hebrew.&quot;</p>
<p>
He is in touch with Dr Saxl of the 
Warburg Institute.</p>
<p>
Is he any use to you or to me &amp; can you 
help him?</p>
<p>
I believe he is rather remarkable. If you 
can do anything will you write to
him? I can't do much from here. I wonder 
is he any use on the book as he's
turned up several times in my path 
lately.</p>
<p>
Have you finished Mercury? I read your 
notes yesterday, the new ones.
There's a lot from the original script 
that you gave me which is missing. Can it be
compressed in? I'm worried about Mercury. 
I am only see him as I've drawn
him not so tricksey as you seem to know 
him. However I'll try. The Fool [?...] up

I haven't written in as those Swords are

can't get on--I've just finished the 
8--now 10-9-2-8 are done also nearly finished 3 but I

will be all right tomorrow. I must have
tried to finish the 8 in a bad light &amp; 
did not notice--also [?...]</p>
<p>
I am thinking a lot, at least I can 
attempt to think, but must you send me 2
copies of all your work which 
necessitates so much sorting. {?...] this afternoon. I
can deal with it. I have been thinking 
that the book would be lovely if it had
opposite the different trumps &amp; playing 
cards a place like a photo-album where
the card could be slipped in instead of a 
separate pack. I find when I read the
script to Ann Christie she understands 
much better if I give her the photograph
of the card to look at all the time. 
perhaps that will make the book too big but
what a de luxe? Yes I sympathize with 
your lethargy over the Tarot. I can
scarcely bear these small cards, so 
difficult to do so {?...], &amp; all the time such
awful listening-in to the world conflict 
that I could scream. No I think I must go
thro with it &amp; get them all done. The 
Lord of Science isn't bad to do &amp; interesting.
The 3, the Briah dark sea, seems to me to 
be most unpleasant! What about her?
Send a line. I am going to do the 6 &amp; 7 
at once--if I can stop getting sick &amp; see too.
Early blackening is such a bore they are 
fiercely nosey &amp; war-[?...] here having
nothing to do &amp; I am, as usual an object

1914 I mechanically put 6 lumps of sugar 
in my tea when I prefer it without! One

<p>
All the Swords are finished &amp; the 10 of 
Cups nearly, but I have difficulty in
getting the cards stretched. The picture 
from Michael Just has not arrived so I
can't show a sample to anyone. Will you 
send on the enclosed letter to him as I
have not got the correct address here. I 
tried to insure the cards, but the
valuation I put on them ([L]1500), they 
wish to have some assurance that that is
the price for which I am selling them. 
They asked for Mr Just's address &amp; I could
not remember it.</p>
<p>
I find all this a bit up-hill. I am in 
solitary confinement, doing my own housework
etc., not too bad only when I emerge from 
this concentrated effort to do the
cards &amp; feel very peculiar.</p>
<p>
Now for the pantacles.</p>
<p>
Do try &amp; answer me about the Aces. I feel 
broody about them. I keep on
thinking about those 4 elements &amp; their 
mightiness &amp; I fell drowned in water,
burnt with fire, cut by the air &amp; dug 
into the earth. The air feels to be the most
solid &amp; dead of them all, which is odd, 
as it is supposed to be so light. No blood
I suppose.</p>

swing over. Am I wrong? I want to put on
the left the receptive side &amp; the power 
on the right. I can't classify anything. More
time here to think, but reading tires my 
eyes. I suppose this will be done soon.</p>
<p>
At it again tomorrow. Have you ever 
realized how much I have given up for this
work? Everything I possess &amp; now I am

I have been haunted all night by your 
complicated mind. You really ought to
have a [...] &amp; if I may humbly draw you 
attention to the fact that paper is only a
surface &amp; can't be made to hold things 
behind &amp; before, altho you, wrapt in the
Spirit, can walk all round them. 
Temperance is a kettle of fish, &amp; listening to
Beethoven last night I realized what a 
fiasco he made when he tried to convey all
he knew in the last movement of the 9th &amp; 
thereby giving up a glimpse of the
transformation scene in the Pantomime, 
instead of the Pure Light of Heaven,
having already led us thro the many 
coloured lands. But forgive me, only I feel
nervous. I think, looking at the finished 
cards you will remember all the
sequences you have forgotten &amp; I shall be 
crushed by alterations which will
confuse the structural design &amp; any 
spectator without your knowledge &amp; so
suffer little children to come unto thee 
&amp; confuse them not by too much
symbolish &amp; stay thy hand from poor 
Frieda's tormented visions.</p>

I have just been reading your Tao Teh 
King. For goodness sake, do try with
those Trumps. There is no-one who thinks 
in the lucid way you do, my little
paltry cards are lost unless you illumine 
them by your Art &amp; for the sake of
those poor little struggling chickens 
squealing like Alice in the Looking Glass
jury at the Grand Trial Scene. For their 
sakes con you not have the courage to do
another masterpiece. But you feel ill. I 
know how feeble that makes one because
one doesn't make a plan. However I'm 
relentless, I'll go on till you drop because
it is worth it. The Poem, the preface are 
magnificent.</p>

Dear Aleister</p>
<p>
Just got your letter. You will know I 
have the notes, but how you got them out
&amp; sent them &amp; none of those chuckle-heads 
at Morton House know yet that you
have done so, is indeed a mystery.</p>
<p>
I am better, I know you are quite right, 
my spiritual state has been sadly
neglected, perhaps because I have been 
trying to paint &amp; live Percy's life at the
same time.</p>
<p>
Now these circumstances are giving me a 
chance. I have had 3 days rest, the
first in 2 years &amp; I've even had time to 
read a bit of Magic &amp; try to assimilate yr.
book. How satisfying to ones inside 
hunger. That old doctor told me I looked
spiritually half starved &amp; you son't 
believe until the last 2 days I have not had
time to feed myself.</p>
<p>
Now my reputation as a coward &amp; shirker 
will protect me I hope &amp; I have had
an opportunity while I have tried to cut 
the jungle round my caravan to look at
these glorious apples &amp; pears on my 
trees. They are so miraculous &amp; so
beautiful.</p>

Dear Aleister</p>
<p>
I have made several attempts to write to 
you, but have been the victim of
upheavals in the domestic surroundings, 
&amp; even now, having assembled a
warm fire, or chair, a cup of tea, I 
simply can't climb down my ladder &amp; fetch
writing-paper, so please forgive this.</p>
<p>
I am sorry you are so seedy. I have been 
thinking you were, but today you
seem better again; are you? I rather wish 
you would not stare at the sword
photographs in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>
I have done, as you suggested, &amp; it looks 
better but it is exceedingly difficult
to alter these cards, as I can't match 
the colours without great effor, I think it is
alright now.</p>
<p>
Just imagine what happened (Mercury is in 
a very ape-like mood). I found the
waste-pipe from the fixed basin leaked. 
&quot;Aha&quot; I sead in the words of a wellknown
poet, &quot;I'll fix it by giving the nut a 
tap with the hammer!&quot; And so I did &amp;
the whole porcelain basin cracked &amp; has 
had to be wrenched from the wall by a
horde of plumber-demons &amp; I have spent a 
day of discomfort &amp; displacement.</p>
<p>
However the Princess is now on the 
stocks. I wish she would not insist on
being pregnant. She just will, so now I 
have let her get on with it. She chatters to
me about being mixed up with the Virgin 
Mary. Anyhow I am having a good
time with the trees &amp; if you don't like 
the design I am, at least, [...] it myself.</p>
<p>
I can't, can't fine the 93. You say 
Equinox of the Gods page 138. There is not
one in the edition you gave me. Hullo! 
just turned the page &amp; see unnumbered
extra page &amp; there is 93, but it is 
almost as indecipherable as your letter. What is
III[deg] ++++ oh dear! it is awfully 
obscure. [ABTz in Hebrew] The Fool. The
Wheel of Fortune--the Devil in the Tarot. 
Then you say leaving aleph to join path
of [He] I take it you mean &quot;He&quot; the 
Priestess [sic]. Do you or don't you--I really
do understand all this better, if I am 
unconscious!</p>
<p>
All the same, apparently I prescribed 
correctly for Pussy, because I wrote &amp;
said all I gathered from thinking into 
her, was that she was awfully tired, &amp;
please would she come &amp; stay a few days 
and not talk, only sleep.</p>
<p>
But you misjudge her, she is really a 
generous brave person, a magnificent
friend, and not a sentimentalist when she 
is not trying to think. So please respect
her, in spite of her conversational 
perversity. I am going to stop &amp; do some of
that boring printing. The man-to-frame is 
now waiting, but it is so difficult to see
at night, &amp; I want to paint by day.</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I am very sorry but I am unable to 
protect you from yourself. Out of the
inextricable confusion of your real &amp; 
bugus financial affairs I find only one thing--that you will always be in a muddle &amp; 
that to attempt to help you is like filling
a leaking cistern &amp; I do not propose to 
begin to do so. I have told you, always, I
have a weekly allowance &amp; that my lessons 
from you are saved out of that &amp; I
cannot draw from the Bank more than I 
have, &amp; if I can't pay for a thing I do not
buy it.</p>
<p>
Anything in the nature of a speculation 
is quite foreign to my nature or my
pocket. Your campaign of giving people 
too much to eat &amp; drink in order to
placate them in the Great Work is all 
wrong, &amp; I expect you know it. If only you
could be simple &amp; dignified, people would 
flock round you to get what they
really want in these hard times--that is 
the help of a colossal brain but, instead
you cook for them because you are bored 
by them, &amp; incidentally would like
them to produce the wherewithal to stock 
your fantastic restaurant &amp; cellar. Can't
you stop--I suppose you can't. I think 
partly Peggy was bewildered by you
eloquence, &amp; ordered for you kitchen a 
great deal more than any one can afford.</p>
<p>
This is not my affair, but please do not 
try to get me to help. You prevent me
from doing what I would like to do &amp;, 
that is work on the Tarot Book with you,
as I absolutely refuse to be entangled by 
your efforts to boost an absurdity. What
a pity. I fear even now the work will be 
unfruitful.</p>
<p>
The House of God appears to me as vortex 
not a mouth, or is it yours which
can't be filled by mortal effort try as 
you may.</p>

Dear Aleister,</p>
<p>
I wrote to you last night in a bit of a 
hurry. All my papers &amp; books are still a
bit mixed up tho I have the Tarot in 
safety, but my hand is still stiff &amp; not good
for work.</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for your Tarot 
writings. They are so good &amp; so dynamic
that I got quite elated as I read them &amp; 
found muself in a whirl, in fact I had to
put them away. In particular I find the 
general character of the cards...most
illuminating. I do congratulate you. The 
Great Work is indeed in progress. I do
wish I had fire &amp; air &amp; water &amp; earth to 
draw with.</p>
<p>
Directly I have put up these fussy black 
blinds for which I am haunted by the
Police &amp; got rid of some jungles of grass 
I am going to work like mad, the Aces
won't do, &amp; what I am to do with Mercury 
after your description I can't think.
Leave it like Michael Angelo did the face 
of Christ. But I wonder if those heavy
arms are hearly right. He is a powerful 
god. Surely the Ape should move, not the
Eternal Figure. What do you think? I am 
so grateful to have a change to try &amp;
help yr. labours.</p>
<p>

Would you go &amp; see Michael &amp; ask him to 
send to Yates at once the sizes of
those pictures he has from the edge of 
the mount. Yates is bothering me to give
him the exact size as he can't get on 
with the albums. I have no mounted pictures
here. If you don't require the blankets 
in Miss Falconer's room, may I have them.
I am cold here.</p>
<p>
Please don't come down yet--I am not 
ready &amp; I should only get fussed &amp;
nervous. Not the week-end too for 
everywhere is crowded &amp; Pucy is about
perhaps.</p>
<p>
I am rationed for petrol so I can't fetch 
&amp; carry you. Some of these privations
like petrol &amp; night-lights are lovely. 
The sky here at night is glorious &amp; one's
eyes are rested by the absence of 
trumpets of illumination also no-one can come
&amp; see one after dark--
what a chance reading &amp; solitude. Ye Gods 
what treasures!! I am limited to 3
minutes on the telephone price 2/ any 
time. I don't think we can buy 2/ of
conversation in that time?</p>
<p>
How is the asthma? What a mess the flat 
must be in. Could you not rope in
someone to wash the floors &amp; the bath &amp; 
the sink &amp; the stove? In despair perhaps
Mrs Blanch could speak to Hughes who 
works once a week for her &amp; he might
come up after he has done her work. He is

you may have mine. Do you

have only 1 &amp; I believe you took
the other with you to work from at 
Charlie's flat. Will you please look. Also Mrs

You will not confuse it with yours as
when I lent it to her I red pencilled the 
things she had to copy for the index. I'd
be glad, like Yorke, to have my Crowley 
Collection Complete.</p>

The 10 is coming out very well. I do 
realize had I had the strength to isolate
myself entirely I could have done it 
better only the eye-sight is a great trial. I
could scream with looking &amp; after it is 
done, shall take a long course of blackout.
Are you suffering as much as I am? Really

Memorandum re &quot;Stipend&quot;</p>
<p>
1. Originally the idea was to dash off a 
pack of cards from (a) the elaborate
&quot;Equinox&quot; descriptions (b) mediaeval 
packs, as The Equinox did not describe the
22 Trumps. We thought that a day apiece 
would be enough for the 40 small
cards; two days apiece for the 16 court 
cards and 11 weeks for the 22 Trumps.
This was thought to be an outside 
estimate--say 6 months in all, allowing for
holidays &amp; interruptions.</p>
<p>
2. The &quot;Stipend&quot; [L]2 weekly had nothing 
to do with my work on the Tarot,
which was practically a full-time job. It 
was to cover my doing shopping and
odd commissions for her--in many cases I 
paid the cost out of my own pocket.
But principally it was to use me as a 
tame &quot;Brains Trust&quot;.</p>
<p>
I instructed her in astronomy and 
astrology, mysticism, Yoga, geometry,
algebra, history, literture, chemistry 
and what not.</p>
<p>
I even criticised--very fruitfully--her 
own efforts at painting.</p>
<p>
_______</p>
<p>
This work, carried out sometimes by 
correspondence--very voluminous--
sometimes by direct verbal instruction, 
had nothing to do with my Tarot work,
which was entirely covered by my 2/3 
interest in the property. </p>
<p>

<p>
Note that the stipend and instruction 
have continued since the completion of
the work on the Tarot.</p><hr>

If Lady Harris likes, she can give it 
away with the cards, I do not want any
money out of it: and she can say she 
wrote it, I don't care.</p>
<p>
But I will not allow the cards to be 
issued so that they can be used only for
gambling or fortune-telling.</p>

An open letter to Alestair Crowley</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>SOCIETY OF HIDDEN MASTERS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dear Sir</p>
<p>
For many years we have watched your 
career with benevolent interest; wile
we have been unable to approve many of 
your activities in particular your
policy of revealing secret knowledge 
which we consider dangerous if in the
possession of untrained and uninitiated 
people. We have always respected your
passionate integrity, your fanatical (and 
in our opinion, indiscreet) love of Truth.</p>
<p>
I our view, this mistaken policy has been 
responsible for many of your own
personal mishaps. For this reason we re 
surprised that you should acquiesce,
even by silence, in so blatant and 
impudent a hoax as the exhibition of Tarot
Cards at the Royal Society of Painters in 
Water Colours, 26/7 Conduit Street,
W.1. beginning 4th August 1942.</p>
<p>
We hereby challenge you to deny any of 
the statements here following:--</p>
<p>
1. During the winter of 1898/9 you were 
entrusted by the Order of A..A.. with
the Secret Lecture on the Tarot, giving 
the initiated attributions.</p>
<p>
2. You published these attributions at 
the command of the Secret Chiefs of the
order in a Book of Reference numbered 777 
in 1909.</p>
<p>
3. You issued the Official Lecture of the 
Order on the Tarot, in the Equinox Vol. I
Nos VII and VIII, March and September 
1912.</p>
<p>
4. You have made the Tarot your continual 
study and used it daily, since the
Winter of 1898/9.</p>
<p>
5. You have made the Tarot the skeleton 
or schema of all your writings on
mystical and magical subjects. We would 
instance particularly &quot;Ambrosia&quot;,
&quot;Magi Hortus Rosarum&quot; (The Wake-World), 
&quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;, &quot;Theory
and Practice of Magick&quot;.</p>
<p>
6. You have been recognized everywhere in 
Europe and America (even, to a less
extent, in India) as the supreme 
Authority on the Tarot; that is, by serious
students of the subject.</p>
<p>
7. You have contemplated the construction 
and publication of a
properly designed and executed pack, 
based on the Equinox information ever
since the issue of the grotesque and 
falsified parody which appeared under the
auspices of the later A.E. Waite.</p>
<p>
6. In a series of conversations in 1937 
beginning at Mr. Clifford Bax' chambers in
Albany St., W.1., you suggested to Lady 
Harris that she might be able to carry
out this work. Although she very rightly 
protested that her knowledge of the
subject hardly extended beyond the name, 
you, with the imbecile optimism
characteristic of you, persuaded her that 
the descriptions of the cards given in
the Equinox would be sufficient guide, 
and persuaded her to make the attempt. </p>
<p>
9. It became obvious almost at once that 
the Equinox designs were artistically
impracticable. Lady Harris very properly 
asked you to take the whole subject in
hand ab ovo esque ad umbilicum. You 
thereupon agreed to devote your whole
knowledge to the work of designing an 
entirely original pack of cards,
incorporating the results of your 39 
years of constant study of the subject with
your profound--if at times unacceptably 
unorthodox--knowledge of comparative
religion, mathematical physics, 
philosophy and Magick. Also nthat you should
compose a Treatise explaining the subject 
in full. It appears from a notice in the
Exhibition that there is a proposal to 
publish the cards as a pack without this
book. To do so would limit their use to 
fortune-telling, a form of fraud against
which you have constantly set your face 
your whole life long. We refuse to
believe that you have now consented to 
prostitute the Sacred Wisdom of Thoth
to this base and dishonest purpose and we 
insist upon this point being made
clear.</p>
<p>
10. On May 11, 1938, Lady Harris became 
officially your disciple, and was
permitted to affiliate to the other Order 
of which you are Head, the O.T.O. </p>
<p>
11. You made an agreement with Lady 
Harris by which you were to have a 66
2/3% interest in the work.</p>
<p>
12. For the next four years 
approximately, Lady Harris prepared water-colours
of the cards. She did this from your 
rough sketches and descriptions under your
continual direction, subject to your 
constant and repeated corrections. In some
cases you made her redraw and re-paint a 
card which you found unsatisfactory
as many as five or six times. She has, 
when left to herself, no sense of dignify or
congruity; one of us has seen some 
attempts which you rejected, for instance, her
ideal figure for &quot;The Fool&quot;, the Holy 
Ghost, was Harpo Marx. Did you really
pass this and Trump I? She gave the 
Sphinx in Trump X a French cabahy sabre!
And her first conception of &quot;The Lord of 
the Winds and the Breezes; the King of
the Spirits of the Air&quot;, was a clown in 
plate armour, waving rapier and dagger,
sprawling over a demented nag, diving 
through a paper screen in a circus!</p>
<p>
13. You left Lady Harris a comparatively 
free hand in respect of insignificant
details; but at no time did she 
contribute a single idea of any kind to any card,
and she is in fact almost as ignorant of 
the Tarot and its true meaning and use as
when she began. We
cannow however, blame you for this.</p>
<p>
14. You have followed with as much 
fidelity as was possible the traditional
designs of the mediaeval packs; but you 
have notably enriched and revivified
some of them, especially the Trumps, with 
your scholarship, as observed above
in paragraph 9.</p>
<p>
15. In every trump you have not only 
incorporated symbols illustrating the
doctrines of Payne Knight, Hargrave 
Jennings, Arthur Eddington, J.G. Frazer,
Bertrand Russell, J.W.N. Sullivan, 
Eliphaz Levi and how many others! --but
introduced very many ideas purely 
personal to yourself and based on your own
personal magical experience--see &quot;The 
Vision and the Voice&quot;, &quot;The Paris
Working&quot; etc.</p>
<p>
16. In certain cases, in order to make 
sure that your doctrine of the New Aeon is
clearly manifest as the spiritual-magical 
basis of the whole work, you have given
new names to the cards. Notably Trumps 
XI, XIV, and numerous &quot;small&quot; cards.
You have made the final correction to the 
attributions--Trumps IV and XVII,
according to the Book fo the Law given to 
you in Cairo April 8, 9, and 10 1904.
You have used &quot;The Stele of Revealing&quot; 
(see &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; Chap. I 49, III
19) to replace &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; (Trump 
XX) to affirm the supersession of the
Aeon of Osiris the Dying God by that of 
Horus the Crowned and Conquering
Child. The entire composition is soaked 
in and reeks of your own private and
personal point of view with regard to 
Magick.</p>
<p>
17. You undertook this Work with two main 
motives:--</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>1. That it should serve as a Magical 
Atlas of and Guide to the
Universe, for this &quot;New Aeon of Horus&quot;, 
that is, for the next
2,000 years.</p>
	<p>2. That its undeniable beauty and majesty 
should be an
intelligible vindication of the whole of 
your life's work.
You rightly foresaw that sooner or later 
it would be clear
that you are the sole responsible author 
of the Work and Lady
Harris only your more or less docile and 
intelligent
instrument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
18. You and Lady Harris were at first 
agreed that the Work should be put forth
anonymously. She wrote to a friend &quot;I 
intend to remain anonymous when the
cards are shown&quot;. You had, of course, 
pointed out that any student of the subject
would recognise your authorship at a 
glance.</p>
<p>
19. Too well aware that in the past your 
work has been stolen and exploited by
unscrupulous rascals and also that 
doctrinal argument of a lightly technical kind
may all too frequently prove rather hard 
for a jury, you took the precaution of
introducing certain symbols into the 
designs of susch a character that the most
stupid would be compelled to acknowledge 
your authorship of the Work.
Your conduct is abominable and 
inexcusable to allow Lady Harris to issue a
catalogue crammed with the grossest 
errors of fact, blunders of scholarsip,
irrelevancies and absurdities; to allow 
her
to make herself the laughing-stock of 
London by larying claim to the authorship
of pictures of which all artists know her 
to be utterly incapable, her work having
been that of a wealthy amateur persistent 
enough to acquire a good technique
but with no personality, no &quot;message&quot; 
groping in Bloomsbury forgs for the
parasitic adulation of a gaggle of 
sycophants.</p>
<p>
We can understand your passionate wish to 
get these cards exhibited, even by
a subterfuge, but you had no right to 
sacrifice Lady Harris and you have no right
to lend yourself, even by silence to the 
perpetration of a hoax transparent and
nausient as it must naturally be, which 
affects the honour of the Fraternity of Art
and Letters.</p>
<p>
We repeat that we are surprised; for 
whatever your faults, you have always
been honourable and truthful with more 
than ancient Roman rigour. You must
speak now.</p>

<p>
Their estimate in paragraph 6 is 
exaggerated: it depends on the definition of
&quot;serious students.&quot;</p>
<p>
Nor would it be useful to deny them, as 
in every case their truth is
guaranteed by evidence independent of my 
asseveration, internal evidence of
documents easily accessible.</p>
<p>
_________</p>
<p>
I do however most strenuously deny 
participation in the hoax. This was
perpetrated by Lady Harris without my 
knowledge or consent; I only learnt of
the exhibitions, in the first case 
several days after the opening, from information
supplied by loyal friends.</p>
