<h1 align="center" class="title">Eight Lectures On Yoga</h1>
        <h2 align="center" class="heading">by<br>
        Mahatma Guru<br>
        Sri Paramahansa Shivaji<br>
        (Aleister Crowley)</h2>
        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p>Aleister Crowley has achieved the reputation of being
        a master of the English language. This book which is as
        fresh and vibrant today as when it was penned over thirty
        years ago demonstrates this fact. It shows how impossible
        it is to categorize him as a particular kind of stylist.
        At turns he can be satirical, poetical, sarcastic,
        rhetorical, philosophical or mystical, gliding so easily
        from one to the other that the average reader is hard put
        to determine whether or not to take him at face value. </p>
        <p>His description of mystical states of consciousness
        clarifies what tomes of more erudite writing fails to
        elucidate. It is in effect a continuation of Part I of
        Book 4 brought to maturity. Nearly three decades had
        elapsed between the writing of these two books, in which
        time his own inner development had soared ineffably. A
        great deal of what he has to say may seem prosaic at
        first sight, but do not be fooled by this. Other of his
        comments are profound beyond belief, requiring careful
        and long meditation if full value is to be derived from
        them. </p>
        <p>This is not a book to be read while standing or
        running. It is a high water mark of Crowley's literary
        career, incorporating all that we should expect from one
        who had experimented with and mastered most technical
        forms of spiritual growth. There is humor here, a great
        deal of sagacity, and much practical advice. This book
        cannot be dispensed with for the student for whom Yoga is
        'the way.' </p>
