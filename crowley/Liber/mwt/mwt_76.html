    <h3>Chapter LXXVI: The Gods: How and Why they Overlap</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>I am glad: it shows you have been putting in some genuine original
    work.&nbsp; Result!&nbsp; You make a very shrewd observation; you have noticed
    the curious fashion in which Gods seem to overlap.&nbsp; It is not the same
    (you point out) with Angels.&nbsp; In no other system do we find a parallel
    for the Living Creatures, Wheels, Wings, Fiery Serpents,<a href="#1">1</a> with such
    quasi-human cohorts as the Beni Elohim who beget the children on women,<a href="#2">2</a>
    to whom the Qabalah has introduced us.&nbsp; The Beni Elohim is actually
    an exception; there is the Incubus and some of the Fairy Folk, as
    well as certain Gods and demi-Gods, who act thus paternally.&nbsp; But you
    are right in the main.&nbsp; The Arabs, for example, have &quot;seven heavens&quot;
    and seven Orders of Angels, also Jinn; but the classes are by no means
    identical.&nbsp; This, even though certain Archangels, notably Gabriel,
    appear in both systems.&nbsp; But then Gabriel is a definite individual, a
    person&mdash;and this fact is the key to your puzzle.</p>

    <p>For, as I have explained in a previous letter, Gods are people: macrocosms, 
    not mere collocations of the elements, planets and signs as are most of 
    the angels, intelligences and spirits.&nbsp; It is interesting to
    note that Gabriel in particular seems to be more than one of these;
    he enjoys the divine privilege of being himself.&nbsp; Between you and me
    and the pylon, I suspect that Gabriel who gave the Q'uran to
    Mohammed was in reality a &quot;Master&quot; or messenger of some such person,
    more or less as Aiwass describes himself as &quot;...the minister of Hoor-paar-
    kraat.&quot;&nbsp; (AL I, 7</a>)&nbsp; His 
    name implies some such function; for G.B.R. is Mercury between the Two Greater 
    Lights, Sol and Luna.&nbsp; This seems to mean that he is something more than a 
    lunar or terrestrial archangel; as he would appear to be from <em>777</em>.&nbsp; 
    (There now!&nbsp; That was my private fiend again&mdash;the Demon of Digression.&nbsp;
    Back to our Gods!)&nbsp; <em>777</em> itself, to say nothing of <em>The Golden Bough</em> 
    and the Good Lord knows how many other similar monuments of lexicography (for really
    they are little more), is our text-book.&nbsp; We are bound to note at
    once that the Gods sympathise, run into one another, coalesce much more closely 
    than any other of the Orders of Being.&nbsp; There is not really much in common 
    between a jackal and a beetle, or between a wolf and an owl, although they are 
    grouped under Pisces or Aries respectively.&nbsp; But Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Melcarth, 
    Mithras, Marsyas &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; a whole string of them comes tripping off the 
    tongue.&nbsp; They all have histories; their birth, their life, their death, their 
    subsequent career; all goes naturally with them exactly as if they were (say) a
    set of warriors, painters, anything superbly human.&nbsp; We feel instinctively 
    that we know them, or at least know of them in the same sense
    that we know of our fellow men and women; and that is a sense which
    never so much as occurs to us when we discuss Archangels.&nbsp; The great
    exception is the Holy Guardian Angel; and this as I have shewn in
    another letter is for exactly the same reason; He is a Person, a
    macrocosmic Individual.&nbsp; (We do not know about his birth and so on;
    but that is because he is, so to speak, a <em>private</em> God; he only appears
    to the world at all through some reference to him by his client; for
    instance, the genius or Augoeides of Socrates).</p>

    <p>Let us see how this works in practice.  Consider Zeus, Jupiter, Amon-
    Ra, Indra, etc., we can think of them as the same identical people
    known and described by Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and Hindus; they   
    differ as Mont Cervin differs from Monte Silvio and the Matterhorn.</p>

    <p>(They are bound to <em>appear</em> different, because the mountain does not look
    the same from Zermatt as it does from Domodossola, or even as seen by
    a French-Swiss and a German-Swiss.)&nbsp; In the same way read the Life of
    Napoleon written by one of his marshals, by Michelet (a rabid Republican), 
    by Lord Rosebery, by a patriotic Russian, and by a German poet
    and philosopher: one can hardly believe that the subject of any two
    of these biographies is the same man.</p>

    <p>But upon certain points the identity is bound to transpire; even when
    we read of his crushing and classic defeat at Waterloo by the Belgians,
    the man is detected.&nbsp; Transferring the analogy to the Gods, it is then
    open to us to suppose that Tahuti, Thoth, Hermes, Mercury, Loki, Hanuman
    and the rest are identical, and that the diversity of the name and the
    series of exploits is due merely to the accidents of time and space.&nbsp;
    But it is at least equally plausible to suggest that these Gods are
    different individuals, although of the identical Order of Being,
    characteristics and function.&nbsp; Very much as if one took Drake, Frobisher,
    Raleigh, Hood, Blake, Rodney and Nelson, as seen through the mists of
    history, tradition, legend and plain mythopoeia.&nbsp; Add a few names not
    English, and our position is closely parallel.&nbsp; Personally, I incline
    to the latter hypothesis; but it would be hard to say why, unless that
    it is because I feel that to identify them completely would be to reduce 
    their stature to that of personifications of various cosmic energies.</p>

    <p>History lends its weight to my view.&nbsp; When the philosophic schools,
    unable to refute the charge of absurdity leveled at the orthodox
    devotee who believed that Mars actually begot Romulus and Remus on a
    Vestal Virgin, explained that Mars was no more than the martial instinct,
    and the Virgin a type of Purity, their faith declined, and with it
    Roman Virtue.&nbsp; &quot;Educate&quot; Colonel Blimp's children and we have the
    &quot;intelligentsia&quot; of Bloomsbury.&nbsp; I am very sorry about all this; 
    but life must always be brutal and stupid so long as it depends upon
    animals and vegetables for nourishment.</p>

    <p>How restore faith in the Gods?&nbsp; There is only one way; we must get to
    know them personally.&nbsp; And that, of course, is one of the principal
    tasks of the Magician.</p>

    <p>One further remark.&nbsp; I have suggested that all these &quot;identical&quot; gods
    are in reality distinct persons, but belonging to the same families.&nbsp;
    Can we follow up this line of thought?&nbsp; Yes: but I will defer it to
    a subsequent letter.</p>
