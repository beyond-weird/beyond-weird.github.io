    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLVIII: Morals of <em>AL</em>&mdash;Hard to Accept, and Why nevertheless we Must Concur</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>No man alive can appreciate better than myself the difficulties
    connected with The Book of the Law</a>.</p>

    <p>You ask me, if I have rightly analysed your somewhat complicated series
    of questions, to advise you as to your attitude towards that Book.</p>

    <p>Naturally, if you wished for detailed explanations, I could no more than
    refer you to that voluminous commentary, verse by verse, which still
    awaits publication.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp; But I think I can sum up the main business in a
    letter of not too exorbitant length.</p>

    <p>To begin: the Author is quite certainly both more than human, and other than human.</p>

    <p>His main aim seems to me to announce the Magical Formula of the Aeon of
    Horus, and to lay down the funadmental principles of conduct that are
    consistent with it.</p>

    <p>I put this first, because your troubles belong to this part of the Book.</p>

    <p>But let me sort out the principal parts of it.</p>

    <p>(1) There is a system of the most sublime philosophy which stands
    altogether apart from any Aeon, or from any other limited condition.</p>

    <p>(2) There is a considerable proportion of the contents which appears to
    refer to &quot;The Beast&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Woman&quot; personally; but these
    titles may be assumed to refer to any one who happens to hold either of
    those offices during the whole period of the Aeon&mdash;approximately 2000 years.</p>

    <p>(3) The sex morality of the Book is not very different from that maintained 
    secretly by aristocrats since the world began.  It is the system natural 
    to any one who has psycho-analysed away all his complexes, repressions, fixations and phobias.</p>

    <p>(4) As matriarchy reflected the Formula of the Aeon of Isis, and patriarchy that 
    of Osiris, so does the rule of the &quot;Crowned and Conquering Child&quot; express 
    that of Horus.  The family, the clan, the state count for nothing; the Individual is the Autarch.</p>

    <p>(5) The Book announces a new dichotomy in human society; there is the
    master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the &quot;lone wolf&quot;
    and the herd.<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <p>(Nietzsche may be regarded as one of our prophets; to a much less
    extent, de Gobineau.)&nbsp; Hitler's &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; is a not too dissimilar
    idea; but there is no volk about it; and if there were, it would certainly not 
    be the routine-looving, uniformed-obsessed, law-abiding, refuge-seeking German; 
    the Briton, especially the Celt, a natural anarchist, is much nearer the mark.&nbsp; 
    Britons will never get together about anything unless and until each one of them 
    feels himself directly threatened.</p>

    <p>Now here I must tell you a story which may throw a good deal of light
    on much that is obscure in the political situation of '25 to date.  The
    venerable lady (S.H. Soror I.W.E. 8&deg; = 3&deg;<a href="#2">2</a>) 
    who, on the death of S.H. Frater 8&deg; = 3&deg; Otto Gebhardi, succeeded him as my 
    representative in Germany (note that all this pertains to the A.'. A.'.; the O.T.O. is
    not directly concerned) attained the Grade of Hermit (AL I, 40</a>).&nbsp; 
    Watching the situation in Europe, she became constantly more convinced that
    Adolf Hitler was her &quot;Magical child;&quot; and she conceived it to be her
    duty to devote her life (for the Hermit &quot;gives only of his Light unto
    men&quot;) to his Magical Education.&nbsp; Knowing that the hegemony of the world
    would fall to the nation that first accepted the Law of Thelema, she made haste 
    to put the <em>Book of the Law</em> in the hands of her &quot;child.&quot;&nbsp; Upon 
    him it most undoubtedly made the deepest impression, especially as she swore him most 
    solemnly to secrecy as to the source of his power.&nbsp; (Obviously, he would not wish 
    to share it with other.).&nbsp; From time to time, when circumstances suggested it, she 
    wrote to him, enclosing pertinent sections of my commentary, of which I had given her a copy
    at the time of the &quot;Zeugnis.&quot;<a href="#ac2">&#134;</a></p>

    <p>Had Hitler been a less abnormal character, no great &quot;Mischief,&quot; or at
    least a very different kind of &quot;mischief,&quot; might have come of it.&nbsp; I
    think you have read <em>Hitler speaks</em>&mdash;if not, do so&mdash;his private conversation 
    abounds in what sound almost like actual quotations from the <em>Book of the Law</em>.&nbsp; 
    But he public man's private conversation can be repeated on the platform only at the risk 
    of his political life; and he served up to the people only such concoctions as would tickle 
    their gross palates.&nbsp; Worse still, he was the slave of his prophetic frenzy;
    he had not undertaken the balancing regimen of the Curriculum of A.'.A.'.; 
    and, worst of all, he was very far indeed from being a full initiate, even in the 
    loosest sense of the term.&nbsp; His Weltanschauung was accordingly a mass of personal 
    and political prejudice; he had no true cosmic comprehension, no true appreciation of 
    First Principles; and he was tossed about in every direction by the varied conflicting
    forces that naturally concentrated their energies ever more strenuously upon him as his 
    personal position became more and more the dominating factor, first in domestic and then 
    in European politics.&nbsp; I warned our S.H. Soror repeatedly that she ought to correct 
    these tendencies; but she already saw the success of her plans within her grasp, and 
    refused to believe that this success itself would alarm the world into combining to 
    destroy him.&nbsp; &quot;But we have the Book,&quot; she confidently retorted, failing
    to see that the other powers in extremity would be compelled to adopt those
    identical principles.&nbsp; Of course, as you know, it has happened as I foresaw; 
    only a remnant of piety-purefied Prelates and sloppy sentimentalists still 
    hold out against the <em>Book of the Law</em>, sabotage the victory, and will turn 
    the Peace into a shambles of surrender if we are fools enough to give ear 
    to their caterwauling&mdash;as in the story of the highly-esteemed tomcat, 
    when at last one of his fans obtained an interview;
    &quot;all he could do was to talk about his operation.&quot;</p>

    that this implies.&nbsp; Race, birth, breeding etc. are important but not absolutely essential factors.</p>

    <p>Has this digression seemed too long?&nbsp; Ah, but it isn't a digression.
    Rightly considered, it strikes at the heart of your &quot;difficulties.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;The <em>Book of the Law</em> takes us back to primitive savagery,&quot; you say.&nbsp; 
    Well, where are we?</p>

    <p>We're at Guernica, Lidice, Oradour-sur-Glane, Rotterdam and hundreds of
    other crimes, to say nothing of Concentration-camp, Stalag, and a million
    lesser horrors and abominations, inconceivable by the most diseased and
    inflamed Sadistic imagination forty years ago.</p>

    <p>You disagree with Aiwass&mdash;so do all of us.&nbsp; The trouble is that He can
    say: &quot;But I'm not arguing; I'm telling you.&quot;</p>

    <p>Now then let us look a little more deeply (and I hope more clearly) into
    his Ethics, with our minds undismayed by any human emotion.</p>

    <p>Aiwass is of a different <em>Order</em> of Being from ourselves.  Consider a
    gold-refiner.&nbsp; &quot;Analysis shows 20 % of copper in this sample; I'll
    beat it in a current of oxygen; that will oxidize the copper.&nbsp; Shake
    it up with sulphuric acid; then we wash away the copper sulphate, and
    that's that.&quot;&nbsp; He does not consider how the copper feels about it;
    indeed, he doesn't believe that the copper knows about it at all.</p>

    <p>Yes, yes, of course; I know that's an extreme case.&nbsp; I only bring it
    in to sow what could be done as a last resort, if pushed to the wall.
    Fortunately, we are not so ill situated.&nbsp; You will, I dare say, without
    my prompting, think of the surgeon and the schoolmaster; but I can go
    one better.&nbsp; We have in recent history a case almost precisely parallel.</p>

    <p>How did I begin this letter?&nbsp; By defining the task of the Author: to
    announce the Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus and so on.&nbsp; In other
    words, to train mankind to the use of a new source of power.</p>

    <p>Page Professor R&ouml;ntgen!&nbsp; Page the Curies!</p>

    <p>How many &quot;Martyrs to X-ray dermatitis?&quot;&nbsp; Willing experimenters who knew
    the risks?&nbsp; Not all of them; lots of patients got burnt in utmost agony
    of death.&nbsp; How many victims were there of the &quot;radium bomb?&quot;&nbsp; (At Guy's,
    wasn't it?)&nbsp; It always has to happen, even with well tried tools, and despite utmost 
    precautions.&nbsp; How many workmen's lives did the Forth Bridge cost?&nbsp; You know, I 
    suppose, that a certain number of fatal accidents are always included in the calculations 
    of any project of Public Works.</p>

    <p>But a new Magical Formula is on a vastly bigger scale.&nbsp; Cast your mind
    for a moment back to the last occasion, when Osiris succeeded to Isis.
    In that great cataclysm not only Empires, but civilizations crashed one
    after another.&nbsp; Three quarters of the Aeon had elapsed before the wine
    of that vintage was really drinkable.</p>

    <p>I expect as I hope that this time (communication being universally
    better established, the foundations better laid, and things in general
    moving quicker) we may be able to enjoy the harvest in very much less
    time.&nbsp; But hang it all! it's hardly reasonable to expect complete
    fruition after only 40 years.</p>

    <p>What seems to me the most encouraging symptom of all is this: the Book
    itself, and the system of Magick based thereon, and the bankruptcy of
    all previous systems (as set forth in <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em>, <em>Magick</em>,
    <em>The Book of Thoth</em>, and other similar works) do furnish us all with a
    clear, concise practical <em>Method</em> (free from all contamination of the
    humbug of faith and superstition) whereby any one of us may attain to
    &quot;the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,&quot; and that
    the many other Beings of intelligence and power indefinitely more exalted
    than anything which we recognize as human&mdash;and, let us hope, capable of
    bestowing upon us a modicum of Wisdom adequate to get us out of the quagmire 
    into which the crisis has temporarily plunged us all!</p>

    <p align="center">Fraternally yours,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&nbsp; It has seemed better to make a postscript of the most important
    argument of all; for it is completely separate.&nbsp; It is this.</p>

    <p>The Book's meaning is &quot;...not only in the English...&quot; etc.&nbsp; 
    (AL I, 36</a>; I, 46</a>;
    I, 54, 55</a>; II, 76</a>; 
    III, 16</a>; III, 39</a>; 
    III, 47</a>; 
    III, 63-68</a>; and 
    III, 73</a>).&nbsp; 
    These passages make it clear that there is a secret interpretation,
    which, being hidden as it is hidden, is presumably of even graver importance 
    than the text as it stands.&nbsp; Such passages as I have been able to
    decipher confirm this view; so also does the discovery of the key number
    31 by Frater Achad.<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;
    We must also expect a genius to arise who will accomplish all this work for us.&nbsp; 
    Again we know that much information of the utmost value has been given through the Hebrew, 
    the Greek and very probably the Arabic Qabalah.</p>

    <p>There is only one logical conclusion of these premises.  We know (a) the
    Book means more than it appears to mean, (b) this inner meaning may
    modify, or even reverse, the outer meaning, (c) what we do understand
    convinces us that the Author of the Book is indeed what he claims to be;
    and, therefore, we must accept the Book as the Canon of Truth, seeking
    patiently for further enlightenment.</p>

    <p>This last point is of especial virtue:  see AL III, 
    63-68.</a>&nbsp; The value to you of the Book varies directly with the degree of 
    your own initiation.</p>
