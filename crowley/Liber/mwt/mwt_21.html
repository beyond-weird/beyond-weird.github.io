    <h3>Chapter XXI: My Theory of Astrology</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>A few well-chosen words about Astrology?&nbsp; Madam, I am only too happy to
    oblige:  our aim is to serve.&nbsp; The customer is usually wrong; but statistics 
    indicate that it doesn't pay to tell him so.</p>

    <p>It seems a long while since I set up your Nativity, and read it, but it
    is very clear in my mind that you were astonished, as so many others
    have been, by the simplicity and correctness of my reading.&nbsp; It began,
    you remember, by your giving me the usual data when we dropped in for
    tea at the Anglers' Rest.&nbsp; I calculated the Ascendant on the spot, and
    remarked &quot;Rubbish!&quot;&nbsp; I looked at you again very carefully; and, 
    after many grunts, observed, &quot;More likely half-past ten&mdash;within an hour 
    one way or the other.&quot;&nbsp; You insisted; I insisted.&nbsp; Unwilling to make 
    a Fracas in the Inn, we decided to put you to the trouble of writing to your
    mother to settle the dispute.&nbsp; Back came the answer: &quot;within a few
    minutes of eleven.&nbsp; I remember because your father had hung on as long
    as he could&mdash;he had to take the morning service.&quot;</p>

    <p>This occurrence is very common in my experience; I have contradicted
    what sounded like ascertained fact and proved on enquiry to have been
    right; so, considering that the statistics I made many years ago showed
    me to have been right 109 times out of 120, I think two things are fairly
    near probation; firstly, I am not guessing&mdash;that doesn't matter much;
    but, secondly, which is of supreme importance, there is a definite connection 
    between the personal appearance and manner of the native, and the Sign of the 
    Zodiac which was rising when he first drew air into his lungs.</p>

    <p>Let me add, to strengthen the argument, that on the few occasions where
    I have erred there has been a good astrological reason for it.&nbsp; E.g. I
    might plump for Pisces rising when it was actually Capricornus; but in
    that case Saturn would have been afflicted by being in Cancer, with
    bad aspects from Venus and the Moon, thus taking away all his rugged,
    male, laborious qualities, and in the Ascendant might have been Jupiter,
    suggesting many of the qualities of Pisces: and so forth.</p>

    <p>Now let me start!&nbsp; You want me to explain the system&mdash;or no-system!&mdash;which 
    I use.&nbsp; I do not &quot;move in a mysterious way My wonders to perform;&quot;
    for nothing could be simpler.&nbsp; For its origin I have to thank Abramelin
    the Mage, who empties the vials of his scorn upon the astrologers of his
    time with their meticulous calculations of &quot;the hours of the planets&quot;
    and so on.&nbsp; I think he goes too far when he says that a planet can have
    no influence at all, or very little, unless it is above the horizon;
    but he meant well, bless him!&nbsp; And, though he does not say so, I believe
    that I do my stuff in very much the same way as he did.</p>

    <p>Modern astrologers multiply their charts until their desks remind me of
    a Bargain Basement in the rush hour!&nbsp; They compare and contrast until
    they are in bat-eyed bewilderment bemused; and when the answer turns
    out absolutely false, exclaim, what a shout: &quot;By Ptolemy, I forgot to
    look at the last Luniation for Buda-Pesth!&quot;&nbsp; But then they can 
    <em>always</em> find something or other which will explain how they came to go 
    wrong: naturally, when you have several hundred factors, helplessly bound and
    gagged, it would be just too bad if you couldn't pick out one to serve
    your turn&mdash;after the event!&nbsp; No, dear girl, it should be obvious to 
    an unweaned brat: (a) they can't see the wood for the trees, (b) they are
    using Ruach on a proposition which demands Neschamah.&nbsp; Intellect is quite
    inadequate; the problem requires mother-wit, intuition, understanding.</p>

    <p>Here is my system in a Number 000 Ampoule.</p>

    <p>Put up the figure at birth: study it, make notes of the aspects and
    dignities, concentrate&mdash;and turn on the Magical Tap!</p>

    <p>Occasionally, when I began, I set up the &quot;progressed figure&quot; to see 
    how the patient was doing this week, but it never seemed to help enough to
    compensate for the distraction caused by the complication.&nbsp; What I do
    observe to examine the situation of to-day is Transits.&nbsp; These I have
    found very reliable; but even with these I usually ignore aspects of
    minor importance.&nbsp; Truth to tell, conjunctions mean very much more than
    the rest put together.</p>

    <p>Talking of aspects, I think it ridiculous to allow vast &quot;orbs&quot; like 15&mdash;
    for Luna, and 12&mdash; for Sol.&nbsp; Astrologers go to extreme lengths to 
    calculate the &quot;solar revolution&quot; figure not to a degree, not to a 
    minute, but to a second: and that when they don't know the exact time of birth 
    within half an hour or more!&nbsp; Talk about straining at a gnat and swallowing 
    a camel!&nbsp; Then what does an hour or so matter anyhow, if you are going to
    allow an aspect, whether it is 2&mdash; or 10&mdash; off?&nbsp; This even with 
    delicate aspects like the quintile or semi-sextile.&nbsp; What would you think of a
    doctor who had a special thermometer made to register -1/100 of a degree,
    and never took notice of the fact that the patient had just swallowed a cupful 
    of scalding hot tea?</p>

    <p>In my own work, I disallow a deviation of 5&mdash; or 6&mdash; from the exact aspect,
    unless there is some alien reason for thinking that it is actually operative.&nbsp; 
    With the minor aspects, I dislike reckoning with them if they are even 3&mdash; away.</p>

    <p>Nor do I see any sense in marking the odd minutes in the Ascendant, when
    one is not sure even of the decan.</p>

    <p>That seems to be about all that is necessary for my &quot;morning hate;&quot;
    suppose we go on to the question of interpretation.</p>

    <p>Thousands of books have been written on Astrology; nobody could possible
    read them all thoroughly, and he would be a great fool to try.&nbsp; But he
    may do little harm by going into them far enough to observe that hardly
    any half-dozen are agreed even on the foundations of their system, hardly 
    any two upon the meaning of any given aspect, dignity, or position; there 
    is not always agreement even upon what questions pertain to which houses.</p>

    <p>There are a few completely quack systems, such as those which mix up
    the science with Toshosophical<a href="#1">1</a> hypotheses; naturally you discard 
    these.&nbsp; But even of generally acceptable forms of Astrology, such as Mundane
    and Horary, I tend to be distrustful.&nbsp; I ask, for instance, why, if Taurus 
    rules Poland and Ireland, as is no doubt the case, the crash and massacres of 1939 
    e.v. and later in the one did not take place in the other.&nbsp; All the seaports 
    of the world naturally come under one of the three watery signs; but we do not find 
    that an affliction of Pisces, which hits Tunis, should do harm to all the other 
    harbours similarly ruled.</p>

    <p>This brings us to the first Big Jump in the steeplechase of the whole
    science.&nbsp; We hear of thousands of people being killed at the same time
    (within an hour or two, perhaps a minute or two) by earthquake, shipwreck, 
    explosion, battle or other form of violence.&nbsp; Was the horoscope of every 
    one of the victims marked with the probability of some such end?&nbsp; I have 
    known very strange cases of coincidence, but not to <em>that</em> extent!</p>

    <p>The answer, I believe, is manifold.&nbsp; It might be, for example, that
    Poland and Ireland are ruled by different degrees of Taurus; that there
    are major and minor figures, the former overruling the latter, so that
    the figure of the launching of the &quot;Titanic&quot; swallowed up the nativities
    of the victims of her wreck.</p>

    <p>Something of this sort is really an obvious truth.&nbsp; Flood in China,
    famine in India, pestilence anywhere, evidently depend on maps of a
    scale far more enormous than the personal.</p>

    <p>Then&mdash;on this point I feel reasonably sure&mdash;there may be one or more
    factors of which we know nothing at all, by which the basic possibilities
    of a figure are set to work.&nbsp; (Just as a car with engine running will not
    start until the clutch is put in.)</p>

    <p>I will conclude by announcing a rather remarkable position.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I see no objection at all to postulating that certain &quot;rays,&quot
      or other means of transmitting some peculiar form or forms of
      energy, may reach us from the other parts of the solar system;
      for we can in fact point to perfectly analogous phenomena in
      the discoveries of the last hundred years or so.&nbsp;
      But that is no more than a postulate.</li>
      <li>The objections to Astrology as such, indicated by what I have
      already pointed out, and several others, would suffice to place
      me among the most arrogant disbelievers in the whole study, were
      it not for what follows.</li>
      <li>The facts with regard to the Ascendant are so patent, so undeni-
      able, and so inexplicable without the postulate in (1), that I
      am utterly convinced of the fundamental truth of the basic
      principles of the science.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I said, &quot;I will conclude&quot;; and I meant it.&nbsp; For now that (or so I 
    hope) you respect sufficiently my conviction that Astrology is a genuine science
    and not a messy mass of <em>O</em>ld <em>W</em>ives' <em>T</em>ales, you will obviously demand
    instruction as to how to learn it, that you may verify my opinion in the
    light of your own experiments.</p>

    <p>This will look much better if I put it in a separate letter.</p>

    <p>'Till then&mdash;</p>
