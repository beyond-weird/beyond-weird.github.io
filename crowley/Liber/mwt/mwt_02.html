    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter II: The Necessity of Magick for All</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,

    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Right glad am I to hear that you have been so thoroughly satisfied with
    my explanation of what Magick is, and on what its theories rest.&nbsp; It is
    good, too, hearing how much you were interested in the glimpse that you
    have had of some of its work in the world; more, that you grasped the
    fact that this apparently recondite and irrelevant information has an
    immediate bearing on your personal life of today.&nbsp; Still, I was not surprised 
    that you should add: &quot;But why should <em>I</em> make a special study of,
    and devote my time and energy to acquiring proficiency in, the Science
    and Art of Magick?</p>

    <p>Ah, well then, perhaps you have not understood my remarks at one of our
    earliest interviews as perfectly as you suppose!&nbsp; For the crucial point
    of my exposition was that Magick is not a matter extraneous to the main
    current of your life, as music, gardening, or collection jade might be.&nbsp;
    No, every act of your life is a magical act; whenever from ignorance,
    carelessness, clumsiness or what not, you come short of perfect artistic
    success, you inevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration.&nbsp; Luckily 
    for all of us, most of the acts essential to continued life are involuntary;
    the &quot;unconscious&quot; has become so used to doing its &quot;True Will&quot;
    that there is no need of interference; when such need arises, we call it
    disease, and seek to restore the machine to free spontaneous fulfillment
    of its function.</p>

    <p>But this is only part of the story.&nbsp; As things are, we have all adventured
    into an Universe of immeasurable, of incalculable, possibilities, of situations 
    never contemplated by the trend of Evolution.&nbsp; Man is a marine
    monster; when he decided that it would be better for him somehow to live
    on land, he had to grow lungs instead of gills.&nbsp; When we want to travel
    over soft snow, we have to invent ski; when we wish to exchange thoughts,
    we must arrange a conventional code of sounds, of knots in string, of
    carved or written characters&mdash;in a word&mdash;embark upon the boundless ocean
    of hieroglyphics or symbols of one sort or another.&nbsp; (Presently I shall
    have to explain the supreme importance of such systems; in fact, the
    Universe itself is not, and cannot be, anything but an arrangement of
    symbolic characters!)</p>

    <p>Here we are, then, caught in a net of circumstances; if we are to do
    anything at all beyond automatic vegetative living, we must consciously
    apply ourselves to Magick, &quot;the Science and Art&quot; (let me remind you!) &quot;of
    causing change to occur in conformity with the Will.&quot;&nbsp; Observe that the
    least slackness or error means that things happen which do not thus conform; 
    when this is so despite our efforts, we are (temporarily) baffled;
    when it is our own ignorance of what we ought to will, or lack of skill
    in adapting our means to the right end, then we set up a conflict in our
    own Nature: our act is suicidal.&nbsp; Such interior struggle is at the base
    of nearly all neuroses, as Freud recently &quot;discovered&quot;&mdash;as if this had
    not been taught, and taught without his massed errors, by the great teachers of 
    the past!&nbsp; The Taoist doctrine, in particular, is most precise and most emphatic 
    on this point; indeed, it may seem to some of us to overshoot the mark; for nothing 
    is permissible in that scheme but frictionless adjustment and adaptation to 
    circumstance.&nbsp; &quot;Benevolence and righteousness&quot; are actually deprecated!&nbsp; 
    That any such ideas should ever have existed (says Lao-tse) is merely evidence of the 
    universal disorder.</p>

    <p>Taoist sectaries appear to assume that Perfection consists in the absence
    of any disturbance of the Stream of Nescience; and this is very much like
    the Buddhist idea of Nibbana.</p>

    <p>We who accept the Law of Thelema, even should we concur in this doctrine
    theoretically, cannot admit that in practice the plan would work out; our
    aim is that our Nothing, ideally perfect as it is in itself, should enjoy
    itself through realizing itself in the fulfillment of all possibilities.&nbsp;
    All such phenomena or &quot;point-events&quot; are equally &quot;illusion&quot;; Nothing is
    always Nothing; but the projection of Nothing on this screen of the phenomenal 
    does not only explain, but constitutes, the Universe.&nbsp; It is the
    only system which reconciles all the contradictions inherent in Thought,
    and in Experience; for in it &quot;Reality&quot; <em>is</em> &quot;Illusion&quot;, &quot;Free-will&quot; 
    <em>is</em> &quot;Destiny&quot;, the &quot;Self&quot; <em>is</em> the &quot;Not-Self&quot;; and so for 
    every puzzle of Philosophy.</p>

    <p>Not too bad an analogy is an endless piece of string.&nbsp; Like a driving
    band, you cannot tie a knot in it; all the complexities you can contrive are 
    &quot;Tom Fool&quot; knots, and unravel at the proper touch.&nbsp; Always either
    Naught or Two!&nbsp; But every new re-arrangement throws further light on the
    possible tangles, that is, on the Nature of the String itself.&nbsp; It is
    always &quot;Nothing&quot; when you pull it out; but becomes &quot;Everything&quot; as you
    play about with it,<a href="#ac1">*</a> since there is no limit to the combinations that
    you can form from it, save only in your imagination (where the whole thing
    belongs!) and that grows mightily with Experience.&nbsp; It is accordingly well
    worth while to fulfill oneself in every conceivable manner.</p>

    <p>It is then (you will say) impossible to &quot;do wrong&quot;, since all phenomena
    are equally &quot;Illusion&quot; and the answer is always &quot;Nothing.&quot;&nbsp; In theory one
    can hardly deny this proposition; but in practice&mdash;how shall I put it?&nbsp;
    &quot;The state of Illusion which for convenience I call my present consciousness 
    is such that the course of action A is more natural to me that the course of action B?&quot;

    <p>Or: A is a shorter cut to Nothing; A is less likely to create internal conflict.</p>

    <p>Will that serve?</p>

    <p>Offer a dog a juicy bone, and a bundle of hay; he will <em>naturally</em> take
    the bone, whereas a horse would choose the hay.&nbsp; So, while you happen to
    imagine yourself to be a Fair Lady seeking the Hidden Wisdom, you come to
    me; if you thought you were a Nigger Minstrel, you would play the banjo,
    and sing songs calculated to attract current coin of the Realm from a
    discerning Public!&nbsp; The two actions are ultimately identical&mdash;see 
    AL I, 22</a>&mdash;and your perception of that 
    fact would make you an Initiate of very high standing; but in the work-a-day world, 
    you are &quot;really&quot; the Fair Lady, and leave the minstrel to grow infirm and 
    old and hire an orphan boy to carry his banjo!</p>

    <p>Now then, what bothers me it this: Have I or have I not explained this
    matter of &quot;Magick&quot;&mdash;&quot;Why should I (who have only just heard of it, at
    least as a serious subject of study) acquire a knowledge of its principles,
    and of the powers conferred by its mastery?&quot;&nbsp; Must I bribe you with promises 
    of health, wealth, power over others, knowledge, thaumaturgical skill, success in 
    every worldly ambition&mdash;as I could quite honestly do?&nbsp; I hope there is no such 
    need&mdash;and yet, shall I confess it?&mdash;it was only because all the &nbsp;good things 
    of life&nbsp; were suddenly seen of me to be worthless, that I took the first steps towards 
    the attainment of that Wisdom which, while enjoying to the full the &quot;Feast of Life,&quot; 
    guarantees me against surfeit, poison or interruption by the knowledge that it is all a Dream,
    and gives me the Power to turn that dream at will into any form that happens to 
    appeal to my Inclination.</p>

    <p>Let me sum up, very succinctly; as usual, my enthusiasm has lured me into
    embroidering my sage discourse with Poets' Imagery!</p>

    <p><em>Why</em> should you study and practice Magick?&nbsp; Because you can't help doing
    it, and you had better do it well than badly.&nbsp; You are on the links,
    whether you like it or not; why go on topping your drive, and slicing
    your brassie, and fluffing your niblick, and pulling your iron, and socketing your mashie 
    and not being up with your putt&mdash;that's 6, and you are not allowed to pick up.&nbsp; 
    It's a far cry to the Nineteenth, and the sky threatens storm before the imminent night.<p>
