    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLVI: Selfishness</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Selfishness?&nbsp; I am glad to find you worrying that bone, for it has
    plenty of meat on it; fine juicy meat, none of your Chilled Argentine
    or Canterbury lamb.&nbsp; It is a pelvis, what's more; for in a way the
    whole structure of the ethics of Thelema is founded upon it.&nbsp; There 
    is some danger here; for the question is a booby trap for the noble, the
    generous, the high-minded.</p>

    <p>&quot;Selflessness,&quot; the great characteristic of the Master of the Temple,
    the very quintessence of his attainment, is not its contradictory, or even its 
    contrary; it is perfectly compatible (nay, shall we say friendly?) with it.</p>

    <p>The Book of the Law</a> has plenty to say on this subject, 
    and it does not mince its words.</p>

    <p>&quot;First, text; sermon, next,&quot; as the poet says.</p>

    <p>AL II</a>, 18, 19, 20, 21.:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;These are dead, 
      these fellows; they feel not.&nbsp; We are not for the poor and sad: the lords of the 
      earth are our kinsfolk.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is a God to live in a dog?&nbsp; No! but the highest are of us.&nbsp; They shall
      rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us.</p>
      <p>&quot;Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and
      fire, are of us.</p>
      <p>&quot;We have nothing with the  outcast and the unfit: let them die in their
      misery.  For they feel not.  Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp
      down the wretched &amp; the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our
      law and the joy of the world. ...&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That sets up a standard, with a vengeance!</p>

    <p>(Note &quot;they feel not,&quot; twice repeated.&nbsp; There should be something 
    important to the thesis herein concealed.)</p>

    <p>The passage becomes exalted, but a verse later resumes the theme, setting
    forth the philosophical basis of these apparently violent and arrogant remarks.</p>

    <blockquote>&quot;...It is a lie, this folly against self....&quot;&nbsp; (AL II, 22</a>)</blockquote>

    <p>This is the central doctrine of Thelema in this matter.&nbsp; What are we to
    understand by it?&nbsp; That this imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness&mdash;
    democracy some call it&mdash;is utterly false and vile.</p>

    <p>Let us look into the matter.&nbsp; (First consult AL II, 
    24</a>, 25</a>, 
    48</a>, 49</a>, 
    58</a>, 59</a>.
    and III, 18</a>, 58</a>, 
    59</a>.  It might be confusing to quote these texts in 
    full; but they throw much further light on the subject.)&nbsp; The word &quot;compassion&quot;
    is its accepted sense&mdash;which is bad etymology&mdash;implies that you are a
    fine fellow, and the other so much dirt; that is, you insult him by
    pity for his misfortunes.&nbsp; But &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot;;
    so don't you do it!&nbsp; You should treat everybody as a King of the same
    order as yourself.&nbsp; Of course, nine people out of ten won't stand for
    it, not for a minute; the mere fact of your treating them decently
    frightens them; their sense of inferiority is exacerbated and intensified; 
    they insist on grovelling.&nbsp; That places them.&nbsp; They force you to
    treat them as the mongrel curs they are; and so everybody is happy!</p>

    <p>The Book of the Law</a> is at pains to indicate the proper 
    attitude of one &quot;King&quot; to another.&nbsp; When you fight him, &quot;As brothers 
    fight ye!&quot;&nbsp; Here we have the old chivalrous type of warfare, which the introduction 
    of reason into the business has made at the moment impossible.&nbsp; <em>Reason</em> and
    <em>Emotion</em>; these are the two great enemies of the Ethic of Thelema.&nbsp; They
    are the traditional obstacles to success in Yoga as well as in Magick.</p>

    <p>Now in practice, in everyday life, this unselfishness is always cropping
    up.&nbsp; Not only do you insult your brother King by your &quot;noble 
    self-sacrifice,&quot; but you are almost bound to interfere with his True 
    Will.&nbsp; &quot;Charity&quot; always means that the lofty soul who bestows 
    it is really, deep down, trying to enslave the recipient of his beastly bounty!</p>

    <p>In practice, I begin afresh, it is almost entirely a matter of the point
    of view.&nbsp; That poor chap looks as if a square meal wouldn't hurt him;
    and you chuck him a half-crown.&nbsp; You offend his pride, you pauperize him,
    you make a perfect cad of yourself, and you go off with a glow of having
    done your good deed for the day.&nbsp; It's all wrong.&nbsp; In such a case, 
    you should make it the request for favour.&nbsp; Say you're &quot;dying for 
    someone to talk to, and would he care to join you in a spot of lunch&quot; at 
    the Ritz, or wherever you feel that he will be the happiest.</p>

    <p>When you can do this sort of thing as it should be done, without embarrassment, 
    false shame, with your whole heart in your words&mdash;do it <em>simply</em>, to 
    sum up&mdash;you will find yourself way up on the road to that royal republic 
    which is the ideal of human society.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&nbsp; Let me insist that &quot;pity&quot; is nearly always an impostor.&nbsp; It 
    is the psychic consolation for fear, the &quot;pitiful man&quot; really is a pitiful 
    man! for his is such a coward that he dare not face his fear, even in imagination!</p>

    <p>P.P.S.  The day after I had written the above postscript I came upon a
    copy of Graham Greene's <em>The Ministry of Fear</em>&mdash;after a long search.&nbsp; 
    He points out that pity is a mature emotion; adolescents do not feel it.&nbsp;
    Exactly; one step further, and he would have reached my own position as set forth 
    above.&nbsp; It is the twin of &quot;moral responsibility,&quot; of the sense of guilt 
    or sin.&nbsp; The Hebrew fable of Eden and the &quot;Fall&quot; is clearly constructed.&nbsp;
    But remember that the serpent Nechesh {Nun-Cheth-Shin} is equivalent to Messiach, 
    {Mem-Shin-Yod-Cheth}, the Messiah.&nbsp; The M is the &quot;Hanged Man,&quot; the sinner;
    and is redeemed by the insertion of the Phallic Yod.</p>

    <p>P.P.P.S.&nbsp; An amusing coincidence.&nbsp; Just as I was polishing up this
    letter the lady whom I had just engaged to help me with some of my work
    irritated me to the point when my screams became so heartrending that
    the village will never sleep again as smoothly as its wont.&nbsp; They split
    the welkin in several places; and although invisible menders were immed-
    iately put on the job it is generally felt that it will never more be
    its original wholeness.</p>

    <p>And why?&nbsp; Just because of her anxiety to please!&nbsp; She asked me 
    if she might do something; I said &quot;Yes;&quot; she then went on begging 
    for my consent, explaining why she had made the request, apologizing for her
    existence!</p>

    <p>She could not understand that all she had to do was to try and please
    herself&mdash;the highest part of herself&mdash;to be assured of my full
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>P.P.P.P.S.&nbsp; &quot;But the A.'. A.'. oath; aren't you&mdash;we&mdash;all 
    out to improve the race, not counting the cost to ourselves!&quot;</p>

    <p>Pure selfishness, child, with foresight!&nbsp; I want a decent place to live
    in next time I come back.&nbsp; And a longer choice of firstrate vehicles for
    my Work.</p>
