    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXIII: &quot;Monsters&quot;, Niggers, Jews, etc.</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Come now, is this quite fair?&nbsp; When I agreed to tip you off about
    Magick and the rest, I certainly never expected to be treated as if I
    were being interviewed by an American Sunday Newspaper.&nbsp; What do I
    prefer for breakfast, and my views on the future of the theatre, and
    is the Great White Brotherhood in favour of Eugenic Babies?&nbsp; No, dear
    sister&mdash;I nearly said sob-sister.&nbsp; But this I will say, you have been
    very artful, and led me on very cleverly&mdash;you must have been a terror
    to young men&mdash;for the matter of that, I dare say you are still!</p>

    <p>And I don't see how to get out of swallowing this last sly bait; as
    you say, &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; does need some attention
    to the definition of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman.&quot;&nbsp; What is the 
    position, you say, of &quot;monsters&quot;?&nbsp; And men of vinferior&quot; 
    races, like the Veddah, Hottentot and the Australian Blackfellow?&nbsp; There 
    must be a line somewhere, and will I please draw it?  You make me feel like Giotto!</p>

    <p>There is one remark which I must make at the beginning.&nbsp; It's some
    poet or other, Tennyson or Kipling, I think (I forget who) that wrote:
    &quot;Folks in the loomp, is baad.&quot;&nbsp; It is true all round.&nbsp; 
    Someone wisely took note that the vilest man alive had always found someone to 
    love him.&nbsp; Remember the monster<!-- WEH NOTE {needs research}:  Is this the "Elephant Man"? --> 
    that Sir Frederick Treves picked up from an East End peep-show, and had petted by princesses?&nbsp; 
    (What a cunning trick!)&nbsp; Revolting, all the same, to read his account of it.&nbsp; 
    He&mdash;the monster, not Treves!&mdash;seems to have been a most charming individual&mdash;ah!&nbsp; 
    That's the word we want.&nbsp; Every individual has some qualities that endear him to some 
    other.&nbsp; And per contra, I doubt if there is any class which is not detestable to some other 
    class.&nbsp; Artists, police, the clergy, &quot;reds,&quot; foxhunters, Freemasons, Jews, 
    &quot;heaven-born,&quot; women's clubwomen (especially in U.S.A.), &quot;Methodys,&quot; golfers, 
    dog-lovers; you can't find one body without its &quot;natural&quot; enemies.&nbsp; It's right,
    what's worse; every class, as a class, is almost sure to have more defects than qualities.&quot; 
    As soon as you put men together, they somehow sink, corporatively, below the level of the worst 
    of the individuals composing it.&nbsp; Collect scholars on a club committee, or men of science
    on a jury; all their virtues vanish, and their vices pop out, reinforced by the self-confidence 
    which the power of numbers is bound to bestow.</p>

    <p>It is peculiarly noticeable that when a class is a ruling minority, it
    acquires a detestation as well as a contempt for the surrounding &quot;mob.&quot;
    In the Northern States of U.S.A., where the whites are overwhelming in
    number, the &quot;nigger&quot; can be more or less a &quot;regular fellow;&quot; 
    in the South, where fear is a factor, Lynch Law prevails.&nbsp; (Should it?&nbsp; 
    The reason for &quot;NO&quot; is that it is a confession of weakness.)&nbsp; But in 
    the North, there is a very strong feeling about certain other classes: the
    Irish, the Italians, the Jews.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Fear again; the Irish in politics, 
    the Italians in crime, the Jews in finance.&nbsp; But none of these
    phobias prevent friendship between individuals of hostile classes.</p>

    <p>I think that perhaps I have already written enough&mdash;at least enough
    to start you thinking on the right lines.  And mark well this!  The
    submergence of the individual in his class means the end of all true
    human relations between men.&nbsp; Socialism means war.&nbsp; When the class
    moves as a class, there can be no exceptions.</p>

    <p>This is no original thought of mine; Stalin and Hitler both saw it
    crystal-clear; both, the one adroitly, the other clumsily, but with
    equally consummate hypocrisy, acted it out.&nbsp; They picked individuals
    to rule under their autocracy, killed off those that wouldn't fit,
    destroyed the power of the Trades Unions or Soviets while pretending
    to make them powerful and prosperous, and settled down to the serious
    business of preparing for the war which both knew to be inevitable.</p>

    <p>It is this fundamental fact which ensures that every democracy shall
    end with an upstart autocrat; the stability of peace depends upon
    the original idea which aggrandized America in a century from four
    millions to a hundred: extreme individualism with opportunity.&nbsp; Our
    own longest period of peace abroad (bar frontier skirmishes like the
    Crimean war) and prosperity at home coincided with Free Trade and
    Laissez-faire.</p>

    <p>Now we may return, refreshed, to the main question of monsters, real
    (like Treves') or imaginary like Jews and niggers.</p>

    <p>'Arf a mo!&nbsp; Haven't we solved the problem, ambulando?&nbsp; Everything
    would be okydoke and hunkydory if only we can prevent classes from
    acting as such?</p>

    <p>I suppose so.&nbsp; Then, what about a spot of pithy paradox for a change?</p>

    <p>Why should the classes want to act as classes?&nbsp; It's obvious; &quot;Union
    is strength.&quot;&nbsp; The worst Fifteen can do more with a football than the
    best opposing team of one&mdash;excuse my Irish!</p>

    <p>Well, what tortoise is <em>that</em> elephant based upon?&nbsp; Why, still obviously,
    upon the universal sense of individual weakness.&nbsp; We all want a big
    bruvver to tell of him!&nbsp; Hence the Gods and the Classes.&nbsp; It's 
    <em>fear</em> at the base of the whole pyramid of skulls.</p>

    <p>How right politicians are to look upon their constituents as cattle!&nbsp;
    Anyone who has any experience of dealing with any class as such knows
    the futility of appealing to intelligence, indeed to any other qualities 
    than those of brutes.</p>

    <p>And so, whenever we find one Man who has no fear like Ibsen's Doctor
    Stockmann or Mark Twain's Colonel Grainger that strolled out on his
    balcony with his shotgun to face the mob that had come to lynch him,
    he can get away with it.  &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; wrote Ibsen, 
    &quot;Ye are against the people, O my chosen!&quot; says <em>The Book of the Law</em>.&nbsp; (AL
    II, 25).</p>

    <p>Not only does it seem to me the only conceivable way of reconciling this and 
    similar passages with &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; to assert 
    the sovereignty of the individual, and to deny the right-to-exist to 
    &quot;class-consciousness,&quot; &quot;crowd-psychology,&quot; and so to mob-rule 
    and Lynch-Law, but also the only practicable plan whereby we may each one of us 
    settle down peaceably to mind his own business, to pursue his True Will, and to 
    accomplish the Great Work.</p>

    <p>So never lose sight for a moment of the maxim so often repeated in
    one context or another in these letters: that fear is at the root of
    every possibility of trouble, and that &quot;Fear is failure, and the forerunner 
    of failure.&nbsp; Be thou therefore without fear; for in the heart
    of the coward virtue abideth not.&quot;</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
