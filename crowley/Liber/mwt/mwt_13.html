    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XIII: System of the O.T.O.</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You inform me that the Earnest Inquirer of your ambit has been asking
    you to explain the difference between the A.'.A.'. and the O.T.O.; and
    that although your own mind is perfectly clear about it, you find it
    impossible to induce a similar lucidity in his.&nbsp; You add that he is not
    (as one might at first suppose) a moron.&nbsp; And will I please do what I
    can about it?</p>

    <p>Well, here's the essential difference <em>ab ovo usque ad mala</em>; the A.'.A.'.
    concerns the individual, his development, his initiation, his passage
    from &quot;Student&quot; to &quot;Ipsissimus&quot;; he has no contact of any kind with any
    other person except the Neophyte who introduces him, and any Student or
    Students whom he may, after becoming a Neophyte, introduce.</p>

    The details of this <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em> are very fully set forth in
    <em>One Star in Sight</em>; and I should indeed be stupid and presumptuous to
    try to do better than that.&nbsp;  But it is true that with regard to the
    O.T.O. there is no similar manual of instruction.&nbsp; In the Manifesto,
    and other Official Pronunciamenti, there are, it is true, what ought to
    be adequate data; but I quite understand that they are not as ordered
    and classified as one would wish; there is certainly room for a simple
    elementary account of the origins of the Order, of its principles, of
    its methods, of its design, of the Virtue of its successive Grades.
    This I will now try to supply, at least in a brief outline.</p>

    <p>Let us begin at the beginning.&nbsp; What is a Dramatic Ritual?&nbsp; It is a
    celebration of the Adventures of the God whom it is intended to invoke.
    (The <em>Bacchae</em> of Euripides is a perfect example of this.)&nbsp; Now, in the
    O.T.O., the object of the ceremonies being the Initiation of the Candi-
    date, it is he whose Path in Eternity is displayed in dramatic form.</p>

    <p>What is the Path?</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The Ego is attracted to the Solar System.</li>
      <li>The Child experiences Birth.</li>
      <li>The Man experiences Life.</li>
      <li>He experiences Death.</li>
      <li>He experiences the World beyond Death.</li>
      <li>This entire cycle of Point-Events is withdrawn into Annihilation.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the O.T.O. these successive stages are represented as follows:&mdash;</p>

     <table width="50%" align="center" border="0" cellspacing="1">
      <tr>
      <td width=10%>1</td><td width>0&deg;</td><td>(Minerval)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>I&deg;</td><td>(Initiation)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>II&deg;</td><td>(Consecration)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td>III&deg;</td><td>(Devotion)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>IV&deg;</td><td>(Perfection, or Exaltation)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>P.I.</td><td>(Perfect Initiate)</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Of these Events of Stations upon the Path all but 3 (II&deg;) are single
    critical experiences.&nbsp; We, however, are concerned mostly with the very
    varied experiences of Life.</p>

    <p>All subsequent Degrees of the O.T.O. are accordingly elaborations of the
    IIø, since in a single ceremony it is hardly possible to sketch, even in
    the briefest outline, the Teaching of Initiates with regard to Life.&nbsp; The
    Rituals V&deg;&ndash;IX&deg; are then instructions to the Candidate how he should
    conduct himself; and they confer upon him, gradually, the Magical Secrets
    which make him Master of Life.</p>

    <p>It is improper to disclose the nature of these ceremonies; firstly,
    because their Initiates are bound by the strictest vows not to do so;
    secondly, because surprise is an element in their efficacy; and thirdly,
    because the Magical Formulae explicitly or implicitly contained therein
    are, from a practical point of view, both powerful and dangerous.&nbsp; 
    Automatic safeguards there are, it is true; but a Black Magician of first-
    class ability might find a way to overcome these obstacles, and work
    great mischief upon others before the inevitable recoil of his artillery
    destroys him.</p>

    <p>Such cases I have known.&nbsp; Let me recount briefly one rather conspicuous
    disaster.&nbsp; The young man was a genius&mdash;and it was his bane.&nbsp; He got
    hold of a talisman of enormous power which happened to be exactly what
    he wanted to fulfill his heart's dearest wish.&nbsp; He knew also the correct
    way of getting it to work; but this way seemed to him far too long and
    difficult.&nbsp; So he cast about for a short cut.&nbsp; By using actual violence
    to the talisman, he saw how he could force it to carry out his design;
    he used a formula entirely alien to the spirit of the whole operation;
    it was rather like extracting information from a prisoner by torture,
    when patient courtesy would have been the proper method.&nbsp; So he crashed
    the gate and got what he wanted.&nbsp; But the nectar turned to poison even
    as he drained the cup, and his previous anguish developed into absolute
    despair.&nbsp; Then came the return of the current, and they brought it in
    &quot;while of unsound mind.&quot;&nbsp; A most accurate diagnosis!</p>

    <p>I do beg you to mark well, dear sister, that a true Magical Operation is
    never &quot;against Nature.&quot;&nbsp; It must go smoothly and serenely according to
    Her laws.&nbsp; One can bring in alien energies and compel an endothermic
    reaction; but&mdash;&quot;Pike's Peak or bust?&quot;&nbsp; The answer will always be BUST!</p>

    <p>To return for a moment to that question of Secrecy: there is no rule to prohibit 
    you from quoting against me such of my brighter remarks as &quot;Mystery is the enemy 
    of Truth;&quot; but, for one thing, I am, and always have been, the leader of the 
    Extreme Left in the Council-Chamber of the City of the Pyramids, so that if I acquiesce 
    at all in the system of the O.T.O. so far as the &quot;secret of secrets&quot; of the 
    IX&deg; is concerned, it is really on a point of personal honour.&nbsp; My pledge given 
    to the late Frater Superior and O.H.O., Dr. Theodor Reuss.&nbsp; For all that, in this 
    particular instance it is beyond question a point of common prudence, both because
    the abuse of the Secret is, at least on the surface, so easy and so tempting, and because, 
    if it became a matter of general knowledge the Order itself might be in danger of calumny 
    and persecution; for the secret is even easier to misinterpret that to profane.</p>
