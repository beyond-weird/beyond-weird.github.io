    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXIV: Necromancy and Spiritism</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Really, you make me ashamed of You!  To write to ignorant me to wise you
    up about necromancy, when you have at your elbow the one supreme classic&mdash;L&eacute;vi's 
    Chapter XIII in the <em>Dogme et Rituel</em>!<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <p>What sublimity of approach!&nbsp; What ingenuity of &quot;considerations!&quot;&nbsp; 
    With what fatally sure steps marches his preparation!&nbsp; With what superb 
    technique does he carry out his energized enthusiasm!&nbsp; And, finally, with
    what exact judicial righteousness does he sum the results of his great
    Evocation of Apollonius of Tyana!</p>

    <p>Contrast with this elaborate care, rightness of every detail, earnestness
    and intentness upon the goal&mdash;contrast, I say, the modern Spiritist in
    the dingy squalor of her foul back street in her suburban slum, the room
    musty, smelling of stale food, the hideous prints, the cheap and rickety
    furniture, calling up any one required from Jesus Christ to Queen Victoria,
    all at a bob-a-nob!</p>

    <p>Faugh!  Let us return to clean air, and analyse L&eacute;vi's experiment; I
    believe that by the application of the principles set forth in my other
    letters on Death and Reincarnation, it will be simple to explain his partial 
    failure to evoke Apollonius.&nbsp; You had better read them over again,
    to have the matter clear and fresh in your mind.</p>

    <p>Now then, let me call you attention to the extreme care which L&eacute;vi took
    to construct a proper Magical Link between himself and the Ancient Master.&nbsp;
    Alas!&nbsp; It was rather a case of building with bricks made without straw;
    he had not at his command any fresh and vital object pertaining intimately
    to Apollonius.&nbsp; A &quot;relic&quot; would have been immensely helpful, especially 
    if it had been consecrated and re-consecrated through the centuries by devout
    veneration.&nbsp; This, incidentally, is the great advantage that one may often
    obtain when invoking Gods; their images, constantly revered, nourished by
    continual sacrifice, serve as a receptacle for the Prana driven into them
    by thousands or millions of worshippers.&nbsp; In fact, such idols are often
    already consecrated talismans; and their possession and daily use is at
    least two-thirds of the battle.</p>

    <p>Apollonius was indeed as refractory a subject as L&eacute;vi could possibly have
    chosen.&nbsp; All the cards were against him.</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> <em>Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie</em>, by Eliphas L&eacute;vi.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>Why?&nbsp; Let me remind you of the sublimity of the man's genius, and the
    extent of his attainment.&nbsp; Apollonius must certainly have made the closest
    links between his Ruach and his Supernal Triad, and this would have gone
    seeking a new incarnation elsewhere.&nbsp; All the available Ruach left 
    floating around in the Akasha must have been comparatively worthless odds and
    ends, true Qlippoth or &quot;Shells of the Dead&quot;&mdash;just those parts of 
    him, in a word, which Apollonius would have deliberately discarded at his death.</p>

    <p>So what use would they be to L&eacute;vi?&nbsp; Even if there were among them a 
    few such elements as would serve his purpose, they would have been devitalized
    and frittered away by the mere lapse of the centuries, since they had lost
    connection with the reality of the Sage.&nbsp; Alternatively, they might have
    been caught up and adopted by some wandering Entity, quite probably some
    malignant demon.</p>

    <p>Qlipoth&mdash;Shells of the Dead&mdash;Obsessing Spirits!&nbsp; Here we are back in
    the pestilent purlieus of Walham Green, and the frowsty atmosphere of the
    frowsy "medium" and the squalid s&eacute;ance.&nbsp; &quot;Look! but do not speak to 
    them!&quot;&nbsp; as Virgil warned Dante.</p>

    <p>So let us look.</p>

    <p>No!&nbsp; Let us first congratulate ourselves that this subject of Necromancy is
    so admirably documented.&nbsp; As to the real Art, we have not only Eliphas
    L&eacute;vi, but the sublimely simple account in the Old Testament of the Witch
    of Endor, her conjuring up of the apparition of Samuel to King Saul.&nbsp; A
    third classic must not be neglected: I have heard or read the story elsewhere&mdash;for 
    the moment I cannot place it.&nbsp; But it is so brilliantly told in <em>I Write as I 
    Please</em> by Walter Duranty that nothing could be happier than to quote him verbatim.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It was the story of a Bolshevik who conversed with a corpse.&nbsp; He told 
      it to me himself, and undoubtedly believed it, although he was an average tough 
      Bolshevik who naturally disbelieved in Heaven and Hell and a Life beyond the 
      Grave.&nbsp; This man was doing 'underground' revolutionary work in
      St. Petersburg when the War broke out; but he was caught by the police
      and exiled to the far north of Siberia.  In the second winter of the War
      he escaped from his prison camp and reached an Eskimo village where they
      gave him shelter until the spring.  They lived, he said, in beastly conditions, 
      and the only one whom he could talk to was the Shaman, or medicine
      man, who knew a little Russian.&nbsp; The Shaman once boasted that he could
      foretell the future, which my Bolshevik friend ridiculed.&nbsp; The next day
      the Shaman took him to a cave in the side of a hill in which there was a
      big transparent block of ice enclosing the naked body of a man&mdash;a white
      man, not a native&mdash;apparently about thirty years of age with no sign of
      a wound anywhere.&nbsp; The man's head, which was clean-shaven, was outside
      the block of ice; the eyes were closed and the features were European.&nbsp; The 
      shaman then lit a fire and burnt some leaves, threw powder on them muttering 
      incantations, and there was a heavy aromatic smoke.&nbsp; He said in Russian 
      to the bolshevik, 'Ask what you want to know.'&nbsp; The Bolshevik spoke in 
      German; he was sure that the Shaman knew no German, but he was equally sure 
      he saw the lips move and heard it answer, clearly, in German.</p>

      <p>He asked what would happen to Russia, and what would happen to him.&nbsp; 
      From the moving lips of the corpse came the reply that Russia would be defeated
      in war and that there would be a revolution; the Tzar would be captured
      by his enemies and killed on the eve of rescue; he, the Bolshevik, would
      fight in the Revolution but would suffer no harm; later, he would be
      wounded fighting a foreign enemy, but would recover and live long.</p>

      <p>The Bolshevik did not really believe what he had seen although he was
      certain that he had seen it.&nbsp; I mean that he explained it by hypnotism
      or auto-suggestion or something of the kind; but it was true, he said,
      that he passed unscathed through the Revolution and the Civil War and
      was wounded in the Polish War when the Red Army recovered Kiev.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So also we are most fortunate in possessing the account almost beyond
    Heart's desire of Spiritism, in Robert Browning's <em>Mr. Sludge the Medium</em>.&nbsp;
    You see that I write &quot;Spiritism&quot; not &quot;Spiritualism.&quot;&nbsp; 
    To use the latter word in this connection is vulgar ignorance; it denotes a system 
    of philosophy which flourished (more or less) is the Middle Ages&mdash;read
    your Erdmann if you want the gruesome details.&nbsp; But why should you?</p>

    <p>The model for Mr. Sludge was David Dunbar Home,<a href="#1">1</a> who was really
    quite a distinguished person in his way, and succeeded in pulling some
    remarkably instructed and blue-blooded legs.&nbsp; Personally, I believe him
    to have been genuine, getting real results through pacts with elementals,
    demons or what not; for when he was in Paris, arrangements were made
    for him to meet Eliphas L&eacute;vi; forthwith &quot;he abandoned the unequal
    contest, and fled in terror from the accursed spot.&quot;</p>

    <p>What annoyed Browning was that he had added to his collection of &quot;Femora
    I have pulled&quot;, those appendages of Elizabeth Barrett; and where R.B.
    was there was no room for anyone else&mdash;as in the case of Allah!</p>

    <p>R.B. was accordingly as spiteful as he could be, and that was not a little.</p>

    <p>It is not fair to tar all mediums with the Sludge brush; there are many
    who could advance quite sincerely some of the apologia of Sludge.&nbsp; Why
    should a medium be immune to self-deception spurred by the Wish-Fiend?&nbsp;
    While there are people walking about outside the Bug-house who can find
    Mrs. Simpson and Generals de Gaulle, Franco, Allenby, Montgomery and who
    else in the &quot;Centuries&quot; of Nostradamus, we should be stupid to assign
    everything to conscious fraud.</p>

    <p>In that case what about poor Tiny Aleister?&nbsp; Do please allow me the
    <em>happy young Eagles</em> of the <em>Old Testament</em>; what clearer prophecy 
    of psychoanalysis, it's only the English for Freud and Jung and Adler!</p>

    <p>No, by no means always fraud.&nbsp; Yet at any s&eacute;ance the &quot;investigators&quot; 
    take no magical precautions soever&mdash;against, say, the impersonation of Iophiel by 
    Hismael, or the Doves of Venus by the A'arab Zareq.<!-- note re this -->  All they attempt
    especially at &quot;demonstrations&quot; and &quot;materializations,&quot; is to guard with
    great elaboration and (as a rule) complete futility against the deceptions of the common 
    conjuror.&nbsp; They are not expecting any genuine manifestation of the &quot;Spirit 
    World;&quot; and this fact makes clear their true subconscious attitude.</p>

    <p>As for those mediums who possess magical ability, they almost always come
    from the most ignorant classes&mdash;Celts are an exception to this rule&mdash;and
    have no knowledge whatever of the technique of the business.&nbsp; Worse, they
    are usually of the type that delights in the secret dirty affinities, and so
    naturally and gladly attract entities of the Qliphothic world to their
    magical circle.&nbsp; Hence tricksters, of the lowest elemental orders, at the
    best, come and vitalize odds and ends of the Ruach of people recently
    deceased, and perform astonishing impersonations.&nbsp; The hollow shells glow
    with infernal fire.&nbsp; Also, of course, they soak up vitality from the
    sitters, and from the medium herself.</p>

    <p>Altogether, a most poisonous performance.&nbsp; And what do they get out of
    it?&nbsp; Even when the &quot;Spirits&quot; are really spirits, they only stuff 
    the party up with a lot of trashy lies.</p>

    <p>To this summary the Laws of Probability insist that there shall be occasional exceptions.</p>
