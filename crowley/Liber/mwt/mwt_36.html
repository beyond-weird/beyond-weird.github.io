    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXXVI: Quo Stet Olympus: Where the Gods, Angels, etc. Live</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>


    <p>We settled what Gods, angels, demons, elementals <em>were</em> some little while
    ago; we also wrote of <em>how</em> they live, so now, insatiable Seeker, you ask
    <em>where</em>.</p>

    <p>But surely, even as a child&mdash;did you not sing that immemorial Gregorian
    plain-chant</p>
    <blockquote>
       &quot;There's a Friend for little children<br>
       Above the bright blue sky.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>Simple enough.&nbsp; A nice flat earth: sun, moon, stars, planets, satellites
    hung up to dry, with occasional meteorites and comets jazzing about to
    vary the monotony; above all that, this bright blue floor based upon
    Reckitts' and advertisements for the Riviera.</p>

    <p>Just like that.&nbsp; And above that again, the Jew Jeweller's hashish dream
    of heaven: see the Apocalypse.&nbsp; A vulgarization of Baudelaire's still,
    shining, mirror world!</p>

    <p>How right Rome was when she put her foot down on great Galileo and his
    upstart kind!&nbsp; But she did not do the job properly.&nbsp; She should 
    have brewed a bogus bogey-tale to frighten people off astronomy for ever.&nbsp;
    But perhaps it was already too late!&nbsp; The mischief had struck roots too
    deep for her.</p>

    <p>What had these wizards wrought?</p>

    <p>Those lovely mediaeval Charts Celestial that still enchant us by sheer
    beauty and sublimity had been made mockery by those sinister adepts of
    sorcery!</p>

    <p>No more flat earth on four pillars&mdash;on?&mdash;</p>

    <p>In India the earth was supported by an elephant who stood on a 
    tortoise&mdash;who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&nbsp; No floor above.&nbsp; 
    Nothing but empty space with swarming galaxies; no <em>room</em> for 
    &quot;heaven.&quot;&nbsp; Simpler to call Olympus or Meru the home 
    of the Gods&mdash;believe it or not! don't ask questions!</p>

    <p>Yet all the time the difficulty is of our own silly making.&nbsp; The most
    elementary consideration of the nature of Gods, angels, demons, and the
    rest, as shown by their peculiar faculties, stamps them all instantly
    as Beings pertaining to more than three dimensions!&nbsp; Just as no number
    of lines is enough to produce the smallest plain, as a cube is capable
    of containing an infinite number of squares, so, far from there being
    no room for heaven, there is absolutely nothing but room!</p>

    <p>Yet of course the nature of that space is for ever incomprehensible,
    nay inconceivable, by any being of a lower dimension.&nbsp; Only when we have
    succeeded in uniting our Conscious (three-dimensional) with our Unconscious 
    (four-dimensional) Self can we expect even a symbolic conception
    of how things go on &quot;in them furrin parts.&quot;</p>

    <p>Speculation on such points is unpardonably profitless; I have only
    devoted these few paragraphs to the subject because it is useful to
    rebut the somewhat soapbox type of critic who thinks to rebut the whole
    thesis &quot;Sunt Daemones&quot; by the snook-cocking query &quot;Quo Stet 
    Olympus.&quot;</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>
