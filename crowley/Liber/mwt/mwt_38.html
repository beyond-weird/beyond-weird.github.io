    <h3>Chapter XXXVIII: Woman&mdash;Her Magical Formula</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issa.</p>

      <p>Wine rots the liver; fever swells the spleen;<br>
      Meat clogs the belly; dust inflames the eye;<br>
      Stone irks the bladder: gout&mdash;plague&mdash;leprosy!<br>
      Man born of woman is most full of trouble;<br>
      God, a gorged fool that belches him, a bubble!<br>
      But of all plagues wherewith a man is cursed,<br>
      Take my word for it, woman is the worst!</p>

    <p>for this letter is to put Woman once and for ever in her place.<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p>But (as usual!) let us first of all make clear what we are to mean by Woman.</p>

    <p>Not that amorphous (or rather, as the poet says, &quot;oniscoid with udders&quot;)
    dull and clamorous lump, bovine, imbecile, giggling, truthless, nymphomaniac yet 
    sexless, malignant, interminable, of whom Schopenhauer rhapsodized in his most 
    famous panegyric: apparently his sentimental softness understood only the best 
    side of her.<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp; 
    No! let us observe, shudder, and lay down the pen.</p>

    <p>That makes me feel better; my duty to conscience is done.</p>

    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>

    <p>The eternal antagonism between the sexes is mere illusion.  As well
    suppose the male the enemy of the female screw.&nbsp; Understand the 
    spiritual reality of each, grasp their magical formulae; the sublime 
    necessity of the apparent opposition will be apparent.</p>

    <p>The <em>ultimate</em> of Woman is Nuit; that of Man, Hadit.&nbsp; 
    The Book of the Law</a> speaks very 
    fully and clearly in both cases.&nbsp; I quote the principal
    passages.</p>

    <p>A. <em>Nuit</em>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Had!&nbsp; The manifestation of Nuit.&nbsp; [1]</p>
      <p>Come forth, o children, under the stars, &amp; take your fill of love!
      <br>I am above you and in you.  My ecstasy is in yours.&nbsp; My joy is to see your 
      joy.
      <br>Above, the gemmed azure is<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naked splendour of Nuit;<br>
      She bends in ecstasy to kiss<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret ardours of Hadit.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winged globe,the starry blue,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!&nbsp; [12-14]</p>

      <p>...Since I am Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof,
      do ye also thus. ...&nbsp; [22]</p>

      <p>...And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of
      the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.<a href="#ac1">*</a> [26]</p>

      <p>...O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men
      speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of
      thee at all, since thou art continuous!
      <br>None, breathed the light, faint &amp; faery, of the stars, and two.
      <br>For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.
      This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division<a href="#3">3</a>
      is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.&nbsp; [27-30]</p>

      <p>Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me
      only!&nbsp; Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain.&nbsp; This
      is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and
      tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.&nbsp; [32]</p>

      <p>...the Law is for all.&nbsp; [34]</p>

      <p>I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while 
      in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy: nor do I
      demand aught in sacrifice.
      <br>My incense is of resinous woods &amp; gums; and there is no blood
      therein: because of my hair the trees of Eternity.
      <br>My number is 11, as all their numbers who are of us.&nbsp; The Five
      Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, &amp; the circle is Red.&nbsp;
      My colour is black to the blind, but the blue &amp; gold are seen
      of the seeing.&nbsp; Also I have a secret glory for them that love me.
      <br>But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars
      in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking
      me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt
      come a little to lie in my bosom. ...
      <br>...I love you!&nbsp; I yearn to you!&nbsp; Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous,
      I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermost
      sense, desire you.&nbsp; Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour
      within you: come unto me!&nbsp; [58-61]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>B. <em>Hadit</em>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Nu! the hiding of Hadit.
      <br>Come! all ye, and learn the secret that hath not yet been revealed.&nbsp;
      I, Hadit, am the complement of Nu, my bride.&nbsp; I am not extended,
      and Khabs is the name of my House.
      <br>In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference,
      is nowhere found.
      <br>Yet she shall be known &amp; I never.  [1-4]</p>

      <p>I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core
      of every star.&nbsp; I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is
      the knowledge of me the knowledge of death.
      <br>I am the Magician and the Exorcist.&nbsp; I am the axle of the wheel,
      and the cube in the circle.&nbsp; 'Come unto me' is a foolish word: for
      it is I that go.
      <br>Who worshipped Heru-pa-kraath have worshipped me; ill, for I am
      the worshipper.&nbsp; [6-8]</p>

      <p>For I am perfect, being Not; and my number is nine by the fools;
      but with the just I am eight, and one in eight: Which is vital,
      for I am none indeed.&nbsp; The Empress and the King are not of me; for
      there is a further secret.
      <br>I am the Empress &amp; the Hierophant.  Thus eleven, as my bride is
      eleven. [15-16]</p>

      <p>I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge &amp; Delight and bright glory,
      and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. ...&nbsp; [22]</p>

      <p>I am alone: there is no God where I am.&nbsp; [23]</p>

      <p>I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling
      there is joy.&nbsp; If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one.&nbsp; 
      If I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture
      of the earth, and I and the earth are one.
      <br>There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these
      runes shall make a great miss.&nbsp; He shall fall down into the pit
      called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.&nbsp;
      [26-27]</p>

      <p>Dost thou fail?&nbsp; Art thou sorry?&nbsp; Is fear in thine heart?
      <br>Where I am these are not.
      <br>Pity not the fallen!&nbsp; I never knew them.&nbsp; I am not for them.&nbsp; 
      I console not: I hate the consoled &amp; the consoler.
      <br>I am unique &amp; conqueror.&nbsp; I am not of the slaves that perish. ...&nbsp; [46-49]</p>

      <p>Blue am I and gold in the light of my bride: but the red gleam is
      in my eyes; &amp; my spangles are purple &amp; green.
      <br>Purple beyond purple: it is the light higher than eyesight.&nbsp; [50-51]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Lest it should all prove too difficult, I have not quoted several
    passages which are completely beyond my comprehension; even in those
    here set down, there is quite a little that I should not care to boast
    that I had altogether clear in my own mind.</p>

    <p>Leaving out nearly everything, the only way to simplify it is to call
    Hadit the &quot;Point-of-view,&quot; and &quot;Anywhere&quot; to be the radix 
    of all possible &quot;Point-Events,&quot; or &quot;experiences,&quot; or 
    &quot;phenomena;&quot;  Nuit is the complement, the total possibilities of 
    any such radix.&nbsp; You can only get this properly into that part of your mind 
    which is &quot;above the Abyss,&quot; <em>i.e.</em> Neschamah: even so, Neschamah 
    must be very thoroughly fertilized by Chiah, and illuminated by Jechidah, to make 
    any sort of a job of it.</p>

    <p>But to come down from the contemplation of Abstract Reality (which,
    being static and &quot;infinite,&quot; is ultimately immeasurable) to these 
    Ideas in their interaction (and thus directly observable), it is easy enough
    to understand the Magical Formula of their interaction.&nbsp; Of course,
    whatever I say can be no more than a rough approximation, even a suggestion 
    rather than a statement; but I cannot help the nature of the case.&nbsp;
    Nuit is the centripetal energy, infinitely elastic because it must fit
    over the hard thrust directed against it; Hadit, the centrifugal, ever
    seeking to penetrate the unknown.&nbsp; Nuit is not to dissimilar from the
    Teh described in <em>Lao-Tze</em>.</p>

    <p>Nor would it be proper to ignore the <em>Book of Lies</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4 align="center">PEACHES</h4>
      <p>Soft and hollow, how thou dost overcome the hard and full!</p>
      <p>It dies, it gives itself; to Thee is the fruit!</p>
      <p>Be thou the Bride; thou shalt be the Mother hereafter.</p>
      <p>To all impressions thus.&nbsp; Let them not overcome thee; yet let them
      breed within thee.&nbsp; The least of the impressions, come to its perfection, is Pan.</p>
      <p>Receive a thousand lovers; thou shalt bear but One Child.</p>
      <p>This child shall be the heir of Fate the Father.</p>
      <p align="center">(p. 12)<a href="#5">5</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I want you to realize that this collaboration of the equal opposites is
    the first condition of existence in any form.&nbsp; The trouble (I think) has
    always been that nobody ever looked at things from outside; they were
    always at one end or the other.&nbsp; This is because one haphazard collection
    of Point-Events chooses to think of itself as a Male; another, as a
    Female.&nbsp; It is totally absurd to think of Winnie as a woman, and Martin
    as a man.&nbsp; The quintessence of each is identical: &quot;Every man and every
    woman is a star.&quot;&nbsp; It is only a superficial accident that has made one
    set determine to function in one particular incarnation as the one or the other.&nbsp; 
    I say function; for there is no difference in the Quintessence.</p>

    <p>Yet, since it is with a Being <em>in its present function</em> that one has to
    deal, it needs must that one acts in practice as if "does" were the same
    as &quot;was.&quot;&nbsp; You might be described as one instance of the 0 = 2 equation,
    and I as another; and any 0 = 2 is indistinguishable from any other.&nbsp;
    Yet you and I are not identical, because all that I can know of you, or
    you of me, is a presentation of a part of that 0 = 2 &quot;Universe;&quot; if we
    were both equally conscious of that Whole, there would be no means of
    becoming aware, as we are in fact aware, of that distinction.</p>

    <p>Somewhat of this is perhaps intended in <em>The Book of the Law</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>... Bind nothing!&nbsp; Let there be no difference made among you between any one
      thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.
      <br>But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! </p>
      <p>(AL I, 22-23)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Whoso availeth (i.e. can put to practical service) is of &quot;presidential
    timber,&quot; so to speak, because he is able to understand the Being behind
    the Function, and is accordingly not liable to be deceived by the facet
    that happens to be presented to him in his Function corresponding.</p>

    <p>The case is not wholly unlike that of a man on a mountain who should see
    two other peaks jutting up from a paten of cloud.&nbsp; Those tips give little
    indication of the great mass that supports each; both are equally of the
    one same planet; they are in fact identical save for the minute spire
    visible.&nbsp; Yet he, reconnoitering with intent to climb them observes closely
    only that function of each crag and icefall which is relevant to his plan
    to reach their summits.&nbsp; He also is of that One Quintessence; but he
    must fit himself adroitly to each successive incident of the respective
    Functions of these mountains if he is to make the contacts which will
    finally enable him to realize the Point-Events which he will summarize
    as &quot;I climbed Mount Collon and the Aiguille de la Za.&quot;</p>

    <p>I don't believe I can put it much better than that, and I'm too lazy to
    try; but I do want to emphasize that Weininger (in <em>Sex and Character</em>)
    merely scratched the surface.&nbsp; All of us, whether we are &quot;full of strange
    oaths and bearded like the pard&quot; or &quot;in our hours of ease Uncertain, coy,
    and hard to please&quot; do in every most minuscule sort of act exercise both
    the male and female functions almost equally; the determination is rarely
    more than a matter of a casting vote.</p>

    <p>It is so even in the embryo.&nbsp; It is much less than 1/10 of 1% that decides 
    whether the foetus will turn out an Alexander or an Alice.&nbsp; Nature delights in 
    delicate touches of this sort; it is one part of Sulphuric Acid in I don't remember 
    how many million parts of water that is enough to turn blue litmus red; and even with 
    our own gross apparatus we can arrange for a ten-thousandth part of a grain to send a 
    scale down with a bang.&nbsp; Think of a roulette ball hovering on the edge at the end
    of a long spin!&nbsp; Think of Buridan's ass!</p>

    <p>So, once for all, shut up, you screaming parrot!&nbsp; Gabble, gabble, gabble,
    it's enough to break one's tympana, and drive a man stark staring mad.</p>
    <blockquote>
       Shut up!<br>
       Shut up!!<br>
       Shut UP!!!
    </blockquote>
    <p>These women!</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&nbsp; One ought, perhaps, to give an outline of how these facts work out
    in the social system of Thelema.</p>

    <p>It may be useful to classify women in three groups, (I exclude the fourth,
    which while anatomically woman, does not function in that capacity: the
    &quot;spinster.&quot;) corresponding to Isis, Osiris and Horus.</p>

    <p>The Isis-Class consists of the mother-type.&nbsp; To them the man is no 
    more than the necessary creator and sustainer of her children.</p>

    <p>The Osiris-Class comprises those women who are devoted to their man <em>qua</em>
    man, and to his career.&nbsp; Her children, if any, she values as reproductions
    of the Beloved; they carry him on into futurity by virtue of her deathless 
    love.</p>

    <p>The Horus-Class is composed of those women who remain children, the playgirls, 
    who love only for pleasure.&nbsp; To them a child is dull at the best, at the 
    worst a nuisance.</p>

    <p>Each of these classes has its qualities and its defects; each should be
    held in equal, although dissimilar, honour.</p>

    <p>And what, you ask, has the man got to say about all this?&nbsp; Nothing
    simpler; all women are subordinate to his True Will.&nbsp; Only the Osiris-Class, 
    provided he can find one of them, are of more than transient use to him; and even 
    in this case, he must be careful to avoid being ensnared.</p>

    <p>But the really important issue is the recognition of each type of True
    Will in woman.</p>
