    <h3>Chapter LXII: The Elastic Mind</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You ask me what I mean by an &quot;elastic mind&quot;&mdash;from our telephone 
    conversation on Friday.</p>

    <p>It is hard to define; but let me give you an example of the bad kind:
    an old riddle.&nbsp; &quot;Why is a story like a ghost?&quot;&nbsp; Because</p>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;A story's a tale<br>
      a tail's a brush<br>
      a brush is a broom<br>
      a brougham is is a carriage<br>
      a carriage is a gig<br>
      a gig's a trap<br>
      a trap is a snare<br>
      a snare's a gin<br>
      gin is a spirit<br>
      and a spirit's a ghost.&quot;<br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You will have noticed a logical blunder&mdash;usually <em>non distributio medii</em>
    or Hobson Jobson&mdash;at every step in the sorites.&nbsp; It is your instinctive, or 
    instructed, objection to commit these that prevents your mind from actually moving on 
    such lines.</p>

    <p>But these &quot;correspondences,&quot; such as they are, ought to present themselves, 
    be judged as false or true, and rejected or accepted accordingly.</p>

    <p>The inelastic mind, on the other hand, is tied by training to a rigid
    sequence, so that it never gets a chance to think for itself.</p>

    <p>To develop a mind properly it needs (<em>a</em>) &quot;Lehrjahre&quot; (a first-clas
    public school and university education, or the equivalent) when it
    learns all sides of a question, and is left free to judge for itself
    and (<em>b</em>) &quot;Wanderjahre,&quot; when it sees the world for itself, not by any
    pre-arranged course (Cooks', Lunns', University Extension, Baedeker)
    but built up on the results of the Lehrjhre, foot or horseback, and
    avoid beaten tracks.</p>

    <p>It is the Rosicrucian injunction to &quot;wear the costume of the country in
    which your are travelling;&quot; this is only another way of saying &quot;When in
    Rome, do as the Romans do.&quot;&nbsp; The object of this is not merely to avoid
    interference or annoyance, but to teach the mind to think down to the
    roots of the local customs.&nbsp; You learn also the great lesson of Thelema,
    that nothing is right or wrong in itself: as we say &quot;Circumstances alter
    cases.&quot;&nbsp; One trains oneself to adapt one's life to the impinging facts:
    to &quot;cut one's coat according to one's cloth.&quot;&nbsp; It leads one to the
    understanding of that great Principle of Compromise which has kept
    England's head above water through the tempests of a chiliad.</p>

    <p>But always behind all these must be Will, the restraining and controlling 
    purposefulness which prevents one getting flabby, as worn rubber does.&nbsp; 
    (This is why no one is surprised to hear an ultra-Socialist
    minister deliver a speech that might have come from Pitt.)&nbsp; There must
    be a perfect readiness of the mind to consider all the possible reactions 
    to any given situation, to judge exactly how far one should yield, and in 
    what direction, and to act accordingly; but always on keen guard against 
    the risk of snapping.</p>

    <p>Remember that the slightest sign of inelasticity means that the rubber
    has already &quot;perished;&quot; and that the test of perfection is that one
    can &quot;Snap back&quot; to the original condition, with no trace of the stress
    to which it has been subjected.</p>

    <p>Beyond all, be armed against the &quot;doctrinaire&quot; type of mind, in yourself
    or in another.&nbsp; One very soon falls into the habit of repeating ones
    pet ideas; as the French say.&nbsp; &quot;C'est enfoncer une porte ouverte;&quot;
    and, probably before you know it yourself, you have become that most
    obscene, abhorred and incurable of human monsters, a BORE.</p>

    <p>I perceive a slight danger of this kind in the letter: moral, SHUT UP!</p>
