    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXVII: Structure of Mind Based on that of Body (Haeckel and Bertrand Russell)</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Was the sudden cloudburst at the end of my last letter somewhat of a surprise, 
    and more that somewhat of a shock?&nbsp; Cheer up!&nbsp; The worst is yet to come.</p>

    <p>This is where clean thinking&mdash;a subject whose fringes I seem to remember
    having touched&mdash;wins the Gold Medal of the Royal Humane Society.</p>

    <p>It is surely the wise course to accept the plain facts; to try to
    explain them away, or to excuse them, is certain to involve one in a
    maelstrom of sophistry; and when, despite these laudable efforts, the
    facts jump up and land a short jab to the point, one is even worse off
    than before.</p>

    <p>This has to be said, because Sammasati is assuredly one of the most
    useful, as well as one of the most trustworthy and most manageable,
    weapons in the armoury of the Aspirant.</p>

    <p>You stop me, obviously with a demand for a personal explanation.&nbsp; &quot;How
    is it,&quot; you write, &quot;that you reject with such immitigable scorn the
    very foundation-stones of Buddhism, and yet refer disciples enthusiastically 
    to the technique of some of its subtlest super-structures?&quot;</p>

    <p>I laff.</p>

    <p>It is the old, old story.&nbsp; When the Buddha was making experiments and
    recording the results, he was on safe ground: when he started to
    theorize, committing (incidentally) innumerable logical crimes in the
    process, he is no better a guesser than the Arahat next door, or for
    the matter of that, the Arahat's Lady Char.</p>

    <p>So, if you don't mind, we will look a little into this matter of Sammasati: 
    what is it when it's at home?</p>

    <p>It may be no more than a personal fancy, but I think Allan Bennett's
    translation of the term, &quot;Recollection,&quot; is as near as one can get in
    English.&nbsp; One can strain the meaning slightly to include Re-collection,
    to imply the ranging of one's facts, and the fitting of them into an
    organized structure.&nbsp; The term &quot;sati&quot; suggests an identification 
    of Being with Knowledge&mdash;see The Soldier and the 
    Hunchback: ! and ?</a> (<em>Equinox</em> I, 1).&nbsp; So far as it applies to the 
    Magical Memory, it lays stress on some such expedient, very much as is explained 
    in Liber Thisarb</a> (<em>Magick</em>, pp. 415 - 422).</p>

    <p>But is it not a little strange that &quot;The Abomination of Desolation
    should be set up in the Holy Place,&quot; as it were?&nbsp; Why should the 
    whole-bearted search for Truth and Beauty disclose such hateful and such
    hideous elements as necessary components of the Absolute Perfection?</p>

    <p>Never mind the why, for a moment; first let us be sure that it is so.
    Have we any grounds for expecting this to be the case?</p>

    <p>We certainly have.</p>

    <p>This is a case where "clean thinking" is most absolutely helpful.  The
    truth is of exquisite texture; it blazons the escutcheon of the Unity
    of Nature in such delicate yet forceful colours that the Postulant may
    well come thereby to the Opening of the Trance of Wonder; yet religious
    theories and personal pernicketiness have erected against its impact the
    very stoutest of their hedgehogs of prejudice.</p>

    <p>Who shall help us here?&nbsp; Not the sonorous <em>Vedas</em>, not the <em>Upanishads</em>,
    Not Apollonius, Plotinus, Ruysbroeck, Molinos; not any gleaner in the
    field of <em>&agrave; priori</em>; no, a mere devotee of natural history and biology:
    Ernst Haeckel.</p>

    <p>Enormous, elephantine, his work's bulk is almost incredible; for us
    his one revolutionary discovery is pertinent to this matter of Sammasati 
    and the revelations of one's inmost subtle structure.</p>

    <p>He discovered, and he demonstrated, that the history of any animal
    throughout the course of its evolution is repeated in the stages of
    the individual.&nbsp; To put it crudely, the growth of a child from the
    fertilized ovum to the adult repeats the adventures of its species.</p>

    <p>This doctrine is tremendously important, and I feel that I do not know
    how to emphasize it as it deserves.&nbsp; I want to be exceptionally accurate;
    yet the use of his meticulous scientific terms, with an armoury of
    quotations, would almost certainly result in your missing the point,
    &quot;unable to see the wood for the trees.&quot;</p>

    <p>Let me put it that the body is formed by the super-position of layers,
    each representing a stage in the history of the evolution of the species.&nbsp;
    The foetus displays essential characteristics of insect, reptile, mammal
    (or whatever they are) in the order in which these classes of animal
    appeared in the world's history.</p>

    <p>Now I want to put forward a thesis&mdash;and as far as I know it is personal
    to myself, based on my work at Cefal&mdash;to the effect that the mind is
    constructed on precisely the same lines.</p>

    <p>You will remember from my note on &quot;Breaks&quot; in meditation how one's
    gradual improvement in the practice results in the barring-out of certain 
    classes of idea, <em>by</em> classes.&nbsp; The ready-to-hand, recent fugitive 
    thoughts come first and first they go.&nbsp; Then the events of the
    previous day or so, and the preoccupations of the mind for that period.
    Next, one comes to the layer of reveries and other forms of wish-phanstasm;
    then cryptomnesia gets busy with incidents of childhood and the like;
    finally, there intrudes the class of &quot;atmospherics,&quot; where one cannot
    trace the source of the interruption.</p>

    <p>All these are matters of the conscious rational mind; and when I explored
    and classified these facts, in the very first months of my serious practice 
    of Yoga, I had no suspicion that they were no more than the foam on a glass 
    of champagne: nay, rather of</p>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;black wine in jars of jade<br>
      Cooled all these months in hoarded snow,<br>
      Black wine with purple starlight in its bosom,<br>
      Oily and sweet as the soul of a brown maid<br>
      Brought from the forenoon's archipelago,<br>
      Her brows bound bright with many a scarlet blossom<br>
      Like the blood of the slain that flowered free<br>
      When we met the black men knee to knee.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>How apt the verses are!  How close are wine and snow to lust and slaughter!</p>

    <p>I have been digressing, for all that; let us return to our goats!</p>

    <p>The structure of the mind reveals its history as does the structure of the body.</p>

    <p>(Capitals, please, or bang on something; that has got to sink in.)</p>

    <p>Just as your body was at one stage the body of an ape, a fish, a frog
    (and all the rest of it) so did that animal at that stage possess a mind
    correlative.</p>

    <p>Now then!&nbsp; In the course of that kind of initiation conferred by Sammasati, 
    the layers are stripped off very much as happens in elementary meditation 
    (Dharana) to the conscious mind.</p>

    <p>(There is a way of acquiring a great deal of strange and unsuspected knowledge of 
    these matters by the use of Sulphuric Ether, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O,
    according to a special technique.&nbsp; I wrote a paper on it once, 16 pp. 4{to}, and 
    fearing that it might be lost had many copies made and distributed.&nbsp; Where is 
    it?&nbsp; I must write you a letter one day.<a href="#1">1</a>)</p>

    <p>Accordingly, one finds oneself experiencing the thoughts, the feelings,
    the desires of a gorilla, a crocodile, a rat, a devil-fish, or what have
    you!&nbsp; One is no longer capable of human thoughts in the ordinary sense
    of the word; such would be wholly unintelligible.</p>

    <p>I leave the rest to your imagination; doesn't it sound to you a little
    like some of the accounts of &quot;The Dweller on the Threshold?&quot;</p>
