    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXXI: Religion&ndash;Is Thelema a &quot;New Religion&quot;?</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>&quot;Would you describe your system as a new religion?&quot;&nbsp; A pertinent question,
    you doubtless suppose; whether it may happen to mean anything is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;well, 
    is what we must try to make clear.</p>

    <p>True, it's a slogan of A.'. A.'.&nbsp; &quot;The method of science&mdash;the aim of
    religion.&&nbsp; Here the word &quot;aim&quot; and the context help the definition;
    it must mean the attainment of Knowledge and Power in spiritual matters&mdash;or words 
    to that effect: as soon as one selects a phrase, one starts to kick holes in it!&nbsp; 
    Yet we both know perfectly well all the time what we do mean.</p>

    <p>But this is certainly not the sense of the word in your question.&nbsp; It may clear 
    our minds, as has so often happened, if we examine it through the lens of dear old Skeat.</p>

    <p>Religion, he says, Latin: <em>religio</em>, piety.&nbsp; Collection or paying attention 
    to: <em>religens</em> as opposed to <em>negligens</em>, neglecting; the attitude of Gallio.&nbsp; 
    But it also implies a binding together i.e. of ideas; in fact, a &quot;body of doctrine.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Not a bad expression.&nbsp; A religion then, is a more or less coherent and consistent set of 
    beliefs, with precepts and prohibitions therefrom deducible.&nbsp; But then there is the sense in which
    Frazer (and I) often use the word: as in opposition to &quot;Science&quot; or &quot;Magic.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Here the point is that religious people attribute phenomena to the will of some postulated Being or 
    Beings, placable and moveable by virtue of sacrifice, devotion, or appeal.&nbsp; Against such, the 
    scientific or magical mind believes in the Laws of Nature, asserts &quot;If A, then B&quot;&mdash;if 
    you do so-and-so, the result will be so-and-so, aloof from arbitrary interference.&nbsp; Joshua, it 
    is alleged, made the sun stand still by supplication, and Hezekiah in the same way cause it to &quot;go 
    back upon the dial of Ahaz;&quot;&nbsp; Willett did it by putting the clock back, and getting an Act 
    of Parliament to confirm his lunacy.&nbsp; Petruchio, too &quot;It shall be what o'clock I say it 
    is!&quot;&nbsp; The two last came close to the magical method; at least, to that branch of it which 
    consists of &quot;fooling all the people all the time.&quot;&nbsp; But such an operation, if true Magick 
    were employed, would be beyond the power of any magician of my acquaintance; for it would mess up the 
    solar system completely.&nbsp; (You remember how this happened, and what came of it, in a rather clever 
    short story by H.G. Wells.)&nbsp; For true Magick means &quot;to employ one set of natural forces at 
    a mechanical advantage as against another set&quot;&mdash;I quote, as closely as memory serves, Thomas 
    Henry Huxley, when he explains that when he lifts his water-jug&mdash;or his elbow&mdash;he does not 
    &quot;defy the Law of Gravitation.&quot;&nbsp; On the contrary, he uses that Law; its equations form
    part of the system by which he lifts the jug without spilling the water.</p>

    <p>To sum up, our system is a religion just so far as a religion means an
    enthusiastic putting-together of a series of doctrines, no one of which
    must in any way clash with Science or Magick.</p>

    <p>Call it a new religion, then, if it so please your Gracious Majesty;
    but I confess that I fail to see what you will have gained by so doing,
    and I feel bound to add that you might easily cause a great deal of
    misunderstanding, and work a rather stupid kind of mischief.</p>

    <p>The word does not occur in <em>The Book of the Law</em>.</p>
    
    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
