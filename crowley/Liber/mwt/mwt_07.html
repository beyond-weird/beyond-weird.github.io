    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter VII: The Three Schools of Magick (2)</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Hoping that you are now recovered from the devastating revelations in
    the matter of the Yellow School, I must ask you to brace yourself for
    disclosures even more formidable about the Black.&nbsp; Do not confuse with
    the Black Lodge, or the Black Brothers.&nbsp; The terminology is unfortunate,
    but it wasn't I that did it.&nbsp; Now then, to work!</p>

    <p>The Black School of Magick, which must by no means be confused with the
    School of Black Magick or Sorcery, which latter is a perversion of the
    White tradition, is distinguished fundamentally from the Yellow School
    in that it considers the Universe not as neutral, but as definitely a
    curse.&nbsp; Its primary theorem is the &quot;First Noble Truth&quot; of 
    the Buddha&mdash;&quot;Everything is Sorrow.&quot;&nbsp; In the primitive classics of this School the
    idea of sorrow is confused with that of sin.&nbsp; (This idea of universal
    lamentation is presumably responsible for the choice of black as its
    symbolic colour.&nbsp; And yet?&nbsp; Is not white the Chinese hue of mourning?)</p>

    <p>The analysis of the philosophers of this School refers every phenomenon
    to the category of sorrow.&nbsp; It is quite useless to point out to them
    that certain events are accompanied with joy: they continue their ruthless 
    calculations, and prove to your satisfaction, or rather dissatisfaction, 
    that the more apparently pleasant an event is, the more malignantly deceptive 
    is its fascination.&nbsp; There is only one way of
    escape even conceivable, and this way is quite simple, annihilation.
    (Shallow critics of Buddhism have wasted a great deal of stupid ingenuity
    on trying to make out that Nirvana or Nibbana means something different
    from what etymology, tradition and the evidence of the Classics combine
    to define it.&nbsp; The word means, quite simply, cessation: and it stands
    to reason that, if everything is sorrow, the only thing which is not
    sorrow is nothing, and that therefore to escape from sorrow is the attainment 
    of nothingness.)</p>

    <p>Western philosophy has on occasion approached this doctrine.  It has at
    least asserted that no known form of existence is exempt from sorrow.
    Huxley says, in his <em>Evolution and Ethics</em>, &quot;Suffering is the badge of
    all the tribe of sentient things.&quot;</p>

    <p>The philosophers of this School, seeking, naturally enough, to amend the
    evil at the root, inquire into the cause of this existence which is
    sorrow, and arrive immediately at the &quot;Second Noble Truth&quot; of the Buddha:
    &quot;The Cause of Sorrow is Desire.&quot;&nbsp; They follow up with the endless 
    concatenation of causes, of which the final root is Ignorance.&nbsp; (I am not
    concerned to defend the logic of this School: I merely state their
    doctrine.)&nbsp; The practical issue of all this is that every kind of action
    is both unavoidable and a crime.&nbsp; I must digress to explain that the
    confusion of thought in this doctrine is constantly recurrent.&nbsp; That is
    part of the blackness of the Ignorance which they confess to be the
    foundation of their Universe.&nbsp; (And after all, everyone has surely the
    right to have his own Universe the way he wants it.)</p>

    <p>This School being debased by nature, is not so far removed from conventional 
    religion as either the White or the Yellow.&nbsp; Most primitive
    fetishistic religions may, in fact, be considered fairly faithful
    representatives of this philosophy.&nbsp; Where animism holds sway, the
    &quot;medicine-man&quot; personifies this universal evil, and seeks to propitiate
    it by human sacrifice.&nbsp; The early forms of Judaism, and that type of
    Christianity which we associate with the Salvation Army, Billy Sunday
    and the Fundamentalists of the back-blocks of America, are sufficiently
    simple cases of religion whose essence is the propitiation of a malignant demon.</p>

    <p>When the light of intelligence begins to dawn dimly through many fogs
    upon these savages, we reach a second stage.&nbsp; Bold spirits master courage 
    to assert that the evil which is so obvious, is, in some mysterious way, an 
    illusion.&nbsp; They thus throw back the whole complexity of sorrow to a single 
    cause; that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid.&nbsp; The problem then 
    assumes a final form: How is that illusion to be destroyed.</p>

    <p>A fairly pure example of the first stage of this type of thought is to
    be found in the <em>Vedas</em>, of the second stage, in the <em>Upanishads</em>.&nbsp; But the
    answer to the question, &quot;How is the illusion of evil to be destroyed?&quot;,
    depends on another point of theory.&nbsp; We may postulate a Parabrahm infinitely good, 
    etc. etc. etc., in which case we consider the destruction of the illusion of evil as the 
    reuniting of the consciousness with Parabrahm.&nbsp; The unfortunate part of this scheme of 
    things is that on seeking to define Parabrahm for the purpose of returning to Its purity,
    it is discovered sooner or later, that It possesses no qualities at all!&nbsp;
    In other words, as the farmer said, on being shown the elephant: There ain't no sich 
    animile.&nbsp; It was Gautama Buddha who perceived the inutility of dragging in this 
    imaginary pachyderm.&nbsp; Since our Parabrahm, he said to the Hindu philosophers, is 
    actually nothing, why not stick to or original perception that everything is sorrow, and 
    admit that the only way to escape from sorrow is to arrive at nothingness?</p>

    <p>We may complete the whole tradition of the Indian peninsula very simply.&nbsp; To 
    the <em>Vedas</em>, the <em>Upanishads</em>, and the <em>Tripitaka</em> of the Buddhists, we
    have only to add the <em>Tantras</em> of what are called the Vamacharya Schools.&nbsp;
    Paradoxical as it may sound the Tantrics are in reality the most advanced
    of the Hindus.&nbsp; Their theory is, in its philosophical ultimatum, a primitive 
    stage of the White tradition, for the essence of the Tantric cults is that by 
    the performance of certain rites of Magick, one does not only escape disaster, but 
    obtains positive benediction.&nbsp; The Tantric is not obsessed by the will-to-die.&nbsp; 
    It is a difficult business, no doubt, to get any fun out of existence; but at least it 
    is not impossible.&nbsp; In other words, he implicitly denies the fundamental proposition that
    existence is sorrow, and he formulates the essential postulate of the
    White School of Magick, that means exist by which the universal sorrow
    (apparent indeed to all ordinary observation) may be unmasked, even as
    at the initiatory rite of Isis in the ancient days of Khem.&nbsp; There, a
    Neophyte presenting his mouth, under compulsion, to the pouting buttocks
    of the Goat of Mendez, found himself caressed by the chaste lips of a
    virginal priestess of that Goddess at the base of whose shrine is written
    that No man has lifted her veil.<!-- this is an invention of Levi's --></p>

    <p>The basis of the Black philosophy is not impossibly mere climate, with
    its resulting etiolation of the native, its languid, bilious, anaemic,
    fever-prostrated, emasculation of the soul of man.  We accordingly find
    few true equivalents of this School in Europe.&nbsp; In Greek philosophy there
    is no trace of any such doctrine.&nbsp; The poison in its foulest and most
    virulent form only entered with Christianity.<a href="#ac1">*</a>&nbsp; But even so, few men of
    any real eminence were found to take the axioms of pessimism seriously.&nbsp;
    Huxley, for all of his harping on the minor key, was an eupeptic Tory.&nbsp; The
    culmination of the Black philosophy is only found in Schopenhauer, and
    we may regard him as having been obsessed, on the one hand, by the despair
    born of that false scepticism which he learnt from the bankruptcy of Hume
    and Kant; on the other, by the direct obsession of the Buddhist documents 
    to which he was one of the earliest Europeans to obtain access.&nbsp;
    He was, so to speak, driven to suicide by his own vanity, a curious
    parallel to Kiriloff in <em>The Possessed</em> of Dostoiewsky.</p>

    <p>We have, however, examples plentiful enough of religions deriving almost
    exclusively from the Black tradition in the different stages.&nbsp; We have
    already mentioned the Evangelical cults with their ferocious devil-god
    who creates mankind for the pleasure of damning it and forcing it to
    crawl before him, while he yells with druken glee over the agony of his
    only son.<a href="#ac2">&#134;</a>&nbsp; But in the same class, we must 
    place Christian Science, so grotesquely afraid of pain, suffering and evil 
    of every sort, that its dupes can think of nothing better than to bleat denials 
    of its actuality, in the hope of hypnotizing themselves into anaesthesia.</p>

    <p>Practically no Westerns have reached the third stage of the Black tradition, 
    the Buddhist stage.&nbsp; It is only isolated mystics, and those men
    who rank themselves with a contemptuous compliance under the standard
    of the nearest religion, the one which will bother them least in their
    quest of nothingness, who carry the sorites so far.</p>

    <p>The documents of the Black School of Magick have already been indicated.&nbsp;
    They are, for the most part, tedious to the last degree and repulsive to
    every wholesome-minded man; yet it can hardly be denied that such books
    as <em>The Dhammapada</em> and <em>Ecclesiastes</em> are masterpieces of literature.&nbsp; 
    They represent the agony of human despair at its utmost degree of intensity,
    and the melancholy contemplation which is induced by their perusal is
    not favourable to the inception of that mood which should lead every
    truly courageous intelligence to the determination to escape from the
    ferule of the Black Schoolmaster to the outstretched arms of the White
    Mistress of Life.</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> Anti-semite writers in Europe&mdash;e.g. Weininger&mdash;call the 
    Black theory and practice Judaism, while by a curious confusion, the same ideas
    are called Christian among Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; In 1936 e.v. the &quot;Nazi&quot; 
    School began to observe this fact.</p>
    <p id="ac2"><b>&#134;</b> N.B. Christianity was in its first stage a Jewish Communism, hardly
    distinguishable from Marxism.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>Let us leave the sinister figure of Schopenhauer for the mysteriously
    radiant shape of Spinoza!&nbsp; This latter philosopher, in respect at least
    of his Pantheism, represents fairly enough the fundamental thesis of the
    White tradition.&nbsp; Almost the first observation that we have to make is
    that this White tradition is hardly discoverable outside Europe.&nbsp; It
    appears first of all in the legend of Dionysus.&nbsp; (In this connection
    read carefully Browning's <em>Apollo and the Fates</em>.)</p>

    <p>The Egyptian tradition of Osiris is not dissimilar.&nbsp; The central idea
    of the White School is that, admitted that &quot;everything is sorrow&quot; 
    for the profane, the Initiate has the means of transforming it to &quot;Everything 
    is joy.&quot;&nbsp; There is no question of any ostrich-ignoring of fact,
    as in Christian Science.&nbsp; There is not even any more or less sophisticated 
    argument about the point of view altering the situation as in Vedantism.&nbsp; 
    We have, on the contrary, and attitude which was perhaps first of all, historically 
    speaking, defined by <!-- pseudo -->Zoroaster, &quot;nature teaches us, and the Oracles 
    also affirm, that even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful and good.&quot;&nbsp; 
    &quot;Stay not on the precipice with the dross of Matter; for there is a place for thine 
    Image in a realm ever splendid.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;If thou extend the Fiery Mind to the work 
    of piety, thou wilt preserve the fluxible body.&quot;<a href="#ac3">*</a></p>

    <p>It appears that the Levant, from Byzantium and Athens to Damascus,
    Jerusalem, Alexandria and Cairo, was preoccupied with the formulation
    of this School in a popular religion, beginning in the days of Augustus
    Caesar.&nbsp; For there are elements of this central idea in the works of
    the Gnostics, in certain rituals of what Frazer conveniently calls the
    Asiatic God, as in the remnants of the Ancient Egyptian cult.&nbsp; The 
    doctrine became abominably corrupted in committee, so to speak, and the
    result was Christianity, which may be regarded as a White ritual overlaid 
    by a mountainous mass of Black doctrine, like the baby of the mother that 
    King Solomon non-suited.</p>
    
    <p>We may define the doctrine of the White School in its purity in very
    simple terms.</p>

    <p>Existence is pure joy.&nbsp; Sorrow is caused by failure to perceive this
    fact; but this is not a misfortune.&nbsp; We have invented sorrow, which
    does not matter so much after all, in order to have the exuberant satisfaction 
    of getting rid of it.&nbsp; Existence is thus a sacrament.</p>

    <p>Adepts of the White School regard their brethren of the Black very much
    as the aristocratic English Sahib (of the days when England was a nation)
    regarded the benighted Hindu.&nbsp; Nietzsche expresses the philosophy of
    this School to that extent with considerable accuracy and vigour.&nbsp; The
    man who denounces life merely defines himself as the man who is unequal
    to it.&nbsp; The brave man rejoices in giving and taking hard knocks, and the
    brave man is joyous.&nbsp; The Scandinavian idea of Valhalla may be primitive,
    but it is manly.&nbsp; A heaven of popular concert, like the Christian; of
    unconscious repose, like the Buddhist; or even of sensual enjoyment, like
    the Moslem, excites his nausea and contempt.&nbsp; He understands that the
    only joy worth while is the joy of continual victory, and victory itself
    would become as tame as croquet if it were not spiced by equally continual 
    defeat.</p>

    <hr class="minor">
    <p id="ac3"><b>*</b>  This passage appears to be a direct hint at the Formula 
    of the IX&deg;O.T.O., and the preparation of the Elixir of Life.</p>
    <hr class="minor">

    <p>The purest documents of the White School are found in the Sacred Books
    of Thelema.  The doctrine is given in excellent perfection both in the
    book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent</a> 
    and the book of Lapis Lazuli</a>.&nbsp; A 
    single passage is adequate to explain the formula.</p>
    <ol start="7">
      <li>Moreover I behld a vision of a river.&nbsp; There was a little boat thereon; and in it under purple sails was a golden woman, an image of Asi wrought in finest gold.&nbsp; Also the river was of blood, and the boat of shining steel.&nbsp; Then I loved her; and, loosing my girdle, cast myself into the stream.</li>
      <li>I gathered myself into the little boat, and for many days and nights did I love her, burning beautiful incense before her.</li>
      <li>Yea!&nbsp; I gave her of the flower of my youth.</li>
      <li>But she stirred not; only by my kisses I defiled her so that she turned to blackness before me.</li>
      <li>Yet I worshipped her, and gave her of the flower of my youth.</li>
      <li>Also it came to pass, that thereby she sickened and corrupted before me.&nbsp; Almost I cast myself into the stream.</li>
      <li>Then at the end appointed her body was whiter than the milk of the stars, and her lips red and warm as the sunset, and her life of a white heat like the heat of the midmost sun.</li>
      <li>Then rose she up from the abyss of Ages of Sleep, and her body embraced me.&nbsp; Altogether I melted into her beauty and was glad.</li>
      <li>The river also became the river of Amrit, and the little boat was the chariot of the flesh, and the sails thereof the blood of the heart that beareth me, that beareth me.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Liber LXV</em>, Cap. II.</p>

    <p>We find even in profane literature this doctrine of the White School of Magick:&mdash;<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>O Buddha! couldst thou nowhere rest<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pivot for the universe?<br>
      Must all things be alike confessed<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere changes rung upon a curse?</p>

      <p>I swear by all the bliss of blue<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Phryne with her powder on<br>
      Is just as false&mdash;and just as true&mdash;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As your disgusting skeleton.</p>

      <p>Each to his taste: if you prefer<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loathly brooding on Decay;<br>
      I call it Growth, and lovelier<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than all the glamours of the day.</p>

      <p>You would not dally with Doreen<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because her fairness was to fade,<br>
      Because you know the things unclean<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That go to make a mortal maid.</p>

      <p>I, if her rotten corpse were mine,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would take it as my natural food,<br>
      Denying all but the Divine<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike in evil and in good.</p>

      <p>Aspasia may skin me close,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lais load me with disease.<br>
      Poor pleasures, bitter bargains, these?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall despise Diogenes.</p>

      <p>Follow your fancy far enough!<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last you surely come to God.</p>
    </blockquote>
           
    <p>There is thus in this School no attempt to deny that Nature is, as Zoroaster 
    said, &quot;a fatal and evil force&quot;; but Nature is, so to speak,
    &quot;the First Matter of the Work&quot;, which is to be transmuted into gold.&nbsp;
    The joy is a function of our own part in this alchemy.&nbsp; For this reason
    we find the boldest and most skillful adepts deliberately seeking out
    the most repugnant elements of Nature that their triumph may be the
    greater.&nbsp; The formula is evidently one of dauntless courage.&nbsp; It 
    expresses the idea of vitality and manhood in its most dynamic sense.</p>

    <p>The only religion which corresponds to this School at all is that of
    ancient Egypt; possibly also that of Chaldea.&nbsp; This is because those
    religions are Magical religions in the strict technical sense; the
    religious component of them is negligible.&nbsp; So far as it exists, it
    exists only for the uninitiate.</p>

    <p>There are, however, traces of the beginning of the influence of the
    School in Judaism and in Paganism.&nbsp; There are, too, certain documents
    of the pure Greek spirit which bear traces of this.&nbsp; It is what they
    called Theurgy.</p>

    <p>The Christian religion in its simplest essence, by that idea of overcoming 
    evil through a Magical ceremony, the Crucifixion, seems at first
    sight a fair example of the White tradition; but the idea of sin and
    of propitiation tainted it abominably with Blackness.&nbsp; There have been,
    however, certain Christian thinkers who have taken the bold logical step
    of regarding evil as a device of God for exercising the joys of combat
    and victory.&nbsp; This is, of course, a perfectly White doctrine; but it
    is regarded as the most dangerous of heresies.&nbsp; (Romans VI. 1,2, et al.)</p>

    <p>For all that, the idea is there.&nbsp; The Mass itself is essentially a
    typical White ritual.&nbsp; Its purpose is to transform crude matter directly
    into Godhead.&nbsp; It is thus a cardinal operation of Talismanic Magick.&nbsp; 
    But the influence of the Black School has corroded the idea with theological
    accretions, metaphysical on the one hand, and superstitious on the other,
    so completely as to mask the Truth altogether.</p>

    <p>At the Reformation, we find a nugatory attempt to remove the Black element.&nbsp; 
    The Protestant thinkers did their best to get rid of the idea of sin, but it was soon 
    seen that the effort could only lead to antinomianism; and they recognized that this 
    would infallibly destroy the religious idea as such.</p>

    <p>Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made a further attempt to free
    Christianity from the dark cloud of iniquity.&nbsp; They joined hands with
    the Sufis and the Vedantists.  But this again led to the mere denial of
    the reality of evil.&nbsp; Thus drawing away, little by little, from clear
    appreciation of the facts of Nature, their doctrine became purely
    theoretical, and faded away, while the thundercloud of sin settled down
    more heavily than ever.</p>

    <p>The most important of all the efforts of the White School, from an exoteric 
    point of view, is Islam.&nbsp; In its doctrine there is some slight
    taint, but much less than in Christianity.&nbsp; It is a virile religion.
    It looks facts in the face, and admits their horror; but it proposes
    to overcome them by sheer dint of manhood.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 
    metaphysical conceptions of its quasi-profane Schools are grossly materialistic.&nbsp; 
    It is only the Pantheism of the Sufis which eliminates the conception of propitiation; 
    and, in practice, the Sufis are too closely allied to the Vedantists to retain hold of 
    reality.</p>

    <p>That will be all for the present.</p>
