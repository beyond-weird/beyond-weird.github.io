    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXVIII: Sore Spots</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Three in one and one in three&mdash;it's the Athanasian Creed in the Black
    Mass&mdash;eh!&nbsp; What's that you say?&nbsp; Oh, quite right, quite, quite right
    of you to remind me.&nbsp; &quot;Definition first!&quot;</p>

    <p>A &quot;sore spot&quot; is one which reacts abnormally and violently, 
    however gently you touch it; more, all the other bits of you give a painful
    jerk, however disconnected they may seem.&nbsp; Still more, the entire
    System undergoes a spasm of apprehension; and the total result is
    that the mental as well as the physical system is quite unable to
    grasp the situation with any accuracy, and the whole man is temporarily
    engulphed in what is naturally not far from a condition of insanity.</p>

    <p>(Now, Athanasius!  It's all right; the lady has gone away to think it
    over.)</p>

    <p>In&mdash;shall I say &quot;Anglo-Saxondom,&quot; or &quot;Teutonic breeds,&quot; 
    or &quot;bourgeoisie,&quot; so as to include some of the French whom when they 
    are good are very good indeed, but when they are bad, they are horrid?&mdash;the 
    presiding God/Gods of this Trinity is/are: 1. Sex, 2. Religion, 3. &quot;Drugs;&quot; 
    and the greatest of these is Sex, actually the main root of which the other two 
    are tough and twisted stems, each with its peculiar species of poisonous flowers, 
    sometimes superficially so attractive that their nastiness passes for Beauty.</p>

    <p>I shall leave it to the psychoanalysts to demonstrate the reduction to
    Sex, merely remarking that though I agree with their analysis as far as
    it goes, I do not allow it to stop where they do.</p>

    <p>For us, Sex is the first unconscious manifestation of Chiah, the Creative
    Energy; and although (like everything else) it is shown both on the
    spiritual and the physical planes, its most important forth-showing is
    on the &quot;Magical&quot; plane, because it actually produces phenomena which
    partake of all these.&nbsp; It is the True Will on the creative plane: &quot;By
    Wisdom formed He the worlds.&quot;&nbsp; So soon as its thaumaturgy is accomplished,
    it is, through Binah, understood as the Logos.&nbsp; Thus in Sex we find
    every one of the primary Correspondences of Chokmah.&nbsp; Being thus ineffable 
    and sacrosanct, it is (plainly enough) peculiarly liable to profanation.&nbsp; 
    Being profaned, it is naturally more unspeakably nasty than any other of the 
    &quot;Mysteries.&quot;&nbsp; You will find a good deal on this subject implied 
    in Artemis Iota</a>, attached to another of my letters to you.</p>

    <p>Before tackling &quot;Sore Spots&quot; seriously, there is after all, one point
    which should be made clear as to this Trinitarian simplification.</p>

    <p>One of the most interesting and fruitful periods of my life was when
    I was involved in research as to the meaning of Sankhara: &quot;tendencies&quot;
    may be, indeed is, a good enough translation, but it leaves one very
    much as deeply in the dark as before.&nbsp; You remember&mdash;I hope!&mdash;that
    Sankhara lies between Vinnanam, Pure Consciousness, and Sanna, Perception.&nbsp;
    For instance, an electric fan in motion: a house-fly &quot;tends&quot;
    to see the vanes as we do when they are still, we &quot;tend&quot; to see a
    diaphanous blur.</p>

    <p>Then, in delirium tremens, why do we tend to see pink rats rather
    than begonias or gazelles?</p>

    <p>We tend to see the myriad flashing colours of the humming bird; the
    bird itself does not; it has no apparatus of colour-sense; to him
    all appears a neutral tint, varying only in degrees of brightness.</p>

    <p>Such were some of the fundamental facts that directed the course of
    my research, whose results you may read in "The Psychology of Hashish",
    by Oliver Haddo in <em>The Equinox</em>, Vol. I, No. 2.&nbsp; The general 
    basis of this Essay is Sankhara; it shows how very striking are the analogies
    between, (1) the results obtained by Mystics&mdash;this includes the Ecstasy
    of Sexual Feeling, as you may read in pretty nearly all of them, from
    St. Augustine to St. Teresa and the Nun Gertrude.&nbsp; The stages recounted
    by the Buddha in his psychological analyses correspond with almost
    incredible accuracy.&nbsp; (2) The phenomena observed by those who use
    opium, hashish, and some other "drugs" (3) The phenomena of various
    forms of insanity.</p>

    <p>The facts of this research are infuriating to the religious mystic; and 
    the fact of its main conclusion is liable to drive him into so delirious 
    a frenzy of rage as to make one reach for one's notebook&mdash;one 
    more typical extreme case!</p>

    <p>Now of course very few religious persons know that they are mystics&mdash;already 
    it annoys them to suggest it!&mdash;but, whether the lady doth protest too much, 
    or too little, the fact is that they are.&nbsp; There is no true <em>rational</em> 
    meaning in religion.&nbsp; Consider the Athanasian Creed itself!</p>

    <p>Observe that the rationalist dare not yield a millionth of a millimetre.</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;First cut the Liquefaction, what comes next<br>
      But Fichte's clever cut at God himself? . . .<br>
      The first step, I am master not to take:&quot;<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>says Bishop Blougram, and is pinned to the cork labelled &quot;St. Januarius&quot;!</p>

    <p>This dilemma, consciously or subconsciously, is well rooted in the
    minds of everybody who takes Life, in any one of its forms, seriously.
    He feels the touch of the rapier, however shrewdly or cautiously
    wielded.  The salute itself is more than enough; he feels already
    the thrust to his vitals.</p>

    <p>I remember sailing happily in to breakfast at Camberwell Vicarage, and
    saying cheerfully, in absolute good faith: &quot;A fine morning, Mr. Kelly!&quot;
    I was astounded at the reply.&nbsp; The dear old gentleman&mdash;and he really
    was one of the best!&mdash;half choked, then gobbled at me like a turkey!&nbsp;
    &quot;You're a very insolent young man!&quot;&nbsp; Poor, tiny Aleister!&nbsp; How 
    was I to know that his son had driven it well home that the hallmark of English 
    stupidity was that the only safe topic of conversation was the weather.&nbsp; And 
    so my greeting was instantly construed as a deliberate insult!</p>

    <p>A typical example of the irrationality of the reactions of a sufferer!</p>

    <p>Now, from this schoolboy level, let us rise and put the case a little
    more strongly.&nbsp; Let us quit the shallows of social backchat for the
    gloomy and horrific abysses of a murder trial!</p>

    <p>To every man and woman that has not seen Sex as it is, faced it,
    mastered it&mdash;you will find elsewhere in these letters sufficient on
    this matter&mdash;it is his secret guilt.&nbsp; Imagine, then, how at any
    reference however remote, the &quot;sinner&quot; quails, his inmost mystery laid
    bare, his evil conscience holding up a tarnished mirror to his deformed
    and hideous face!&quot; Often enough, he does not mind gross jests which
    admit complicity on the part of the other; but any allusion to the
    Truth, and his soul shrieks: I am found out!&quot; Then apoplectic Fear
    puts on the mask of Indignation and Disgust.</p>

    <p>As for a serious discussion of anything concerned therewith, why, every
    word is a new rasping tear.&nbsp; The mind takes refuge in irrational and
    irrelevant outbursts of feigned rage and horror.</p>

    <p>In the case of religion, the consciousness of guilt extended to cover
    everything from &quot;playin' chuch-farden on the bless‚d tombstones&quot; to
    &quot;the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.&quot;&nbsp; Against this vague and 
    monstrous bogey, religion is the only safeguard, and therefore to suggest
    the unsoundness of the guarantee is to strike at the roots of all
    security.&nbsp; It is like hinting to some besotted and uxorious oldster,
    that his young wife may be unfaithful.&nbsp; It is the poison that Iago
    dripped so skillfully into the long hairy ear of the dull Moor.&nbsp; So he
    reacts irrationally&mdash;every bush conceals a bear&mdash;nay, more likely a
    Boojum,<a href="#1">1</a> or a Bunyip,<a href="#2">2</a> or some other creature 
    of fear-spurred Imagination!&nbsp; &quot;<em>Monstrum informe, ingens, 
    horrendum</em>.&quot;<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp; Note well the &quot;<em>informe</em>.&quot;</p>

    <p>And because the guarantee is unsound (and must be, or where would be the 
    point of &quot;Faith&quot;?) reassurance is in the nature of things impossible.&nbsp;
    Like the demented rider in <em>The Erl-King</em>, the chase goes ever wilder
    and wilder, until he plunges at the end into the bottomless bog of
    madness and destruction.</p>

    <p>I wonder how many lunatics there are in the &quot;bughouse&quot; to-day&mdash;in the
    times of &quot;evangelical revival&quot; the number was fantastic&mdash;who got there
    through fear that they had somehow committed the aforesaid &quot;blasphemy against 
    the Holy Ghost.&quot;&nbsp; The unknown again.&nbsp; <em>The Bible</em> does not tell
    us that it is; only that it is unpardonable.  Nor Grace, nor Faith, nor predestination 
    avail in the least; for all you know, you may have committed it.&nbsp; Reassurance is 
    impossible; no <em>ceinture de chastet&eacute;e</em>‚ avails to avert <em>this</em> danger.</p>

    <p>Again with drugs, it is the unknown which is the horrific factor.&nbsp; Most
    people get their information on the subject from the yellowest of yellow
    newspapers, magazines and novels.&nbsp; So darkly deep is their ignorance
    that that do not know what the word means&mdash;like us so often, yes?</p>

    <p>Wide sections of the U.S.A. are scared of tea and coffee.  They blench
    when you point out that bicarbonate of soda is a drug just as much as
    cocaine; at the same time they literally shovel in the really dangerous 
    Aspirin, to say nothing of the thousand Patent Medicines blared at
    them from every radio&mdash;as if the Press were not enough to poison the
    whole population!&nbsp; Blank-eyed, they gasp when they learn that of all
    classes, the first place among &quot;drug addicts&quot; is that of the doctor.</p>

    <p>But the crisis in which fear becomes phobia is the unreasoning aversion,
    the shuddering of panic, above all, the passionate refusal to learn
    anything about &quot;drugs,&quot; to analyse the conditions, still less to face
    them; and the spasmodic invention of imaginary terrors, as if the real
    dangers were not enough to serve as a warning.</p>

    <p>Now why?&nbsp; Surely because in the sub-conscious lies an instinct that
    in these obscure medicines indeed lies the key of some forbidden sanctuary.&nbsp;
    There is a fascination as irrational and therefore as strong, as the fear.&nbsp; 
    Here is the point at which they link up with sex and religion.&nbsp; Oh, how well 
    nigh almighty is the urgency to him who reads those few great writers who 
    understood the subject from experience: de Quincey, Ludlow, Poe and Baudelaire:
    into whom burn the pointed parallels between their adventures and those of all 
    the mystics, East and West!</p>

    <p>The worst of this correspondence-form is that you are always asking
    simple elementary questions which require half a dozen treatises to
    answer: so, take this, with my blessing!</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&nbsp; One further reflection.&nbsp; With all these &quot;sore spots&quot; 
    is closely linked the idea of cruelty.&nbsp; I need not touch upon the relation of
    cruelty to sex; the theme has been worn threadbare.&nbsp; But in religion,
    note the Bottomless Pit and the Eternal Flame; in Buddhism, the eighteen hot 
    and eighteen cold Hells, with many another beneath.&nbsp; Hindu eschatology has 
    countless Hells; even pedestrian, precise Islam, and the calculating Qabalists, 
    each boast of Seven.&nbsp; Again with drugs as with insanity, we are confronted 
    constantly with nameless terrors; the idea of formlessness, of infinity pervades 
    them alike.&nbsp; Consider the man who takes every chance gesture of a stranger 
    in the street as a secret sign passed from one of his persecutors to another; 
    consider those who refuse food because of the mysterious conspiracy to poison them.</p>

    <p>All sanity, which is all Science, is founded upon Limit.&nbsp; We must be
    able to cut off, to define, to measure.&nbsp; Naturally, then, their opposites, 
    Insanity and Religion, have for their prime characteristic, the
    Indefinable, Incomprehensible, Immeasurable.</p>

    <p>The healing virtue of these words is this: examine the sore spot, analyse it, 
    probe it; then disinfection and the <em>Vis Medicatrix Naturae</em>, complete the cure.</p>

    <p>I had just finished this when in comes your very pertinent &quot;Supplementary"&quot;
    Postcard.&nbsp; &quot;Doesn't hypocrisy fit in here, somehow?&quot;&nbsp; Indeed it
    does, my child!</p>

    <p>Corresponding to, and the poison bacillus of, that centre of infection,
    is a Trinity of pure Evil, the total abnegation of Thelema.  Well known
    to the psycho-analyst: the name thereof Shame&mdash;Guilt&mdash;Fear.&nbsp; The
    Anglo-Saxon or bourgeois mentality is soaked therein; and his remedy
    so far from our exploratory-disinfection method, is to hide the gan-
    grened mass with dirty poultices.  He has always a text of Scripture
    or some other authority to paint his foulest acts in glowing colours;
    and if he wants a glass of beer, he hates the stuff, but &mdash;doctor's
    orders, my boy, doctor's orders.&mdash;</p>

    <p>There is really nothing new to be said about hypocrisy; it has been
    analysed, exposed, lashed by every great Artist; quite without effect.
    It gets worse as the socialistic idea thrives, as the individual leans
    ever harder on the moral support of the herd.<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> Here is a most pertinent story from <em>I Write as I Please</em> 
    by my old friend, Walter Duranty.&nbsp; It shows how the sentimental point of view
    blinds its addicts to the most obvious facts.</p>

    <p>&quot;My friend Freddy Lyon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. told me a story .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the 
    Volga Famine.&nbsp; Some A.R.A. 'higher-ups' from New York were making a tour of 
    inspection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Among them was a worthy but sentimental citizen who gushed 
    about the unhappy Russians and the poor little starving children and what a
    privilege it was for Mr. Lyon to be doing this noble work for humanity and so on 
    and so forth until Lyon said he was ready to choke him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After lunch 
    the visitors suggested they would like to visit the cemetary.&nbsp; It was, said 
    Freddy, a horrid sight, nude, dead bodies piled up ten high like faggots, because 
    the population was so destitute that every stitch of clothing was needed for the 
    living.&nbsp; The visitors were sickened by what they saw, and even the gushing 
    one was silent as they walked back to the cemetery gate.&nbsp; Suddenly he caught 
    Freddy by the arm.&nbsp; 'Look there!' he said, 'Is not that something to restore 
    our faith in the goodness of God in the midst of all these horrors?'&nbsp; He pointed 
    to a big woolly dog lying asleep on a grave with his head between his paws, and continued 
    impressively.&nbsp; 'Faithful unto death and beyond.&nbsp; I have often heard of a dog 
    refusing to be comforted when his master died, lying desolate on his grave, but I never 
    thought to see such a thing my- self.'&nbsp; That was too much for Freddy Lyon.&nbsp; 
    'Yes,' he said cruelly, 'but look at the dog's paws and muzzle'&mdash;they were stiff 
    with clotted blood&mdash;'he's not mourning his master, he's sleeping off a meal.'</p>

    <p>'At which point,' Lyon concluded his story with gusto, 'that talkative
    guy did the opposite of sleeping off his lunch in a very thorough manner,
    and there wasn't another peep out of him until we put him on the train.'&quot;</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>P.S. Here is a very different set of reactions.&nbsp; I do not quite know
    why I am putting it in; is it some sub-conscious attraction of my own?&nbsp;
    Anyhow, here it is; call it</p>

    <h4 align="center">LA POULE AUX RATS</h4>

    <p>Time: a fine Sunday evening in June, just one and twenty years ago.
    Place: Paris, just off the Place des Tertres, overlooking the city.
    A large and lovely studio, panelled in oak.  Strange: it was completely
    bare, and so far as one could see, it had no door.  The skylights, mind-
    ful, were carefully screened with broidered stuff.  A gallery, some ten
    feet from the floor, ran round one corner.  Here was a buffet loaded
    with priceless wines and liquors of all sorts&mdash;except the 
    &quot;soft&quot;&mdash;and excellent variety of all cold &quot;snack&quot; 
    refreshments.&nbsp; One gained it by a staircase from the lower floor.</p>

    <p>By the buffet, the old butler: oh, for a painter to portray his Weariness 
    of Evil Wisdom!</p>

    <p>Our host led us to the gallery; &quot;we ate and drank and saw&quot; not 
    God also, but the lady responsible for the heavy tread upon the stairs.&nbsp; A
    woman of the Halles Centrales, in her early forties; coarse, brutal,
    ugly, robust, square-set, curiously radiant with some magnetic form of
    energy.</p>

    <p>I cannot describe her clothes&mdash;for lack of material.&nbsp; She greeted 
    us all round with a sort of surly good humour.&nbsp; The butler took a pot of
    very far-gone Roquefort cheese, and smeared her all over.&nbsp; She drank
    to us, and clumped away downstairs.&nbsp; She came out into the studio from
    under  the gallery, braced herself and shook her mop of hair as if about
    to wrestle, waved to us and waited.</p>

    <p>A minute later a small trap at the far end of the studio was smartly
    pulled up; in rushed a hundred starving rats.&nbsp; There was a moment's
    hesitation; but the smell of the cheese was too much, and they rushed
    her.&nbsp; She caught one in both hands, bit through its spine, and flung
    it aside.</p>

    <p>Softly repeating to myself passages from <em>The Revenge</em> by the late Alfred
    Lord Tennyson, of which the scene most powerfully reminded me.&nbsp; &quot;Rat
    after rat, for half an hour, flung back as fast as it came.&quot;&nbsp; Their
    courage wilted; the hunted became the huntress; I thought of Artemis as I sang 
    softly to myself, &quot;When the hounds of spring are on winter's traces.&quot;<a href="#4">4</a>&nbsp; 
    But she pursued; snapped the last spine, and flung it into the gallery with a yell 
    of triumph.</p>

    <p>It was not so easy a victory as I have perhaps described it, once she
    slipped in the slime and came down with a thud; and at the end blood
    spurted from innumerable bites.</p>

    <p>The whole scene was too much for most of the men; they literally
    howled liked famished wolves, and shook the balustrade until it creaked
    and groaned.&nbsp; Presently one slipped over, let himself lightly to the
    floor and charged.&nbsp; Others followed.&nbsp; All had their heart's 
    desire.&nbsp; I was reminded of Swinburn's <em>Laus Veneris</em>,</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;I let mine eyes have all their will of thee<br>
      I seal myself upon thee with my might.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>As for the women, the ferocious glitter of their eyes was almost terrifying.&nbsp; 
    One of them, true, would have joined the happy warriors below; but the butler roughly 
    pulled her back, saying in a shocked voice, &quot;Madame est <em>normale</em>.&quot;&nbsp; 
    (I enjoyed that!)&nbsp; Others consoled themselves by capturing those males who were 
    too timid to risk the jump.</p>

    <p>I swallowed a last glass of champagne, and then &quot;<em>je filai a l'Anglais</em>.&quot;</p>

    <p>Summary: a pleasant time was had by all.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />
    <p>Note for political economists: the woman took 10,000 francs (at about 125 to the &pound;);
    she took three weeks in hospital and three weeks' holiday between the shows.&nbsp; She 
    was, or had been, the mistress of a Minister with &quot;peuple&quot; ideas, though 
    he was an aristocrat of very old vintage; and he helped her to have her daughters brought 
    up in one of the most exclusive convents in France.</p>

    <p><em>Note</em></p>
    <p>Kenneth Grant, who was doing secretarial work for Crowley around the time some of the 
    letters in <em>Magick Without Tears</em> were written, later printed in his <em>Remembering 
    Aleister Crowley</em> (London: Skoob, 1991) some material originally intended for this 
    letter which he had written down in a notebook and then misplaced:</p>

    <p><em>Insert in &quot;Sore Spots.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>Here is a case in point from recent experience.&nbsp; In my play &quot;The Three Wishes&quot; 
    one of the characters is a rich selfish woman who has exhausted every source of vicious pleasure.&nbsp; 
    In here abject despair her last resource is addiction to morphine.</p>
    <p>I gave the play to an actor, a man of the highest intelligence and the broadest views on life; 
    he said that I could not hope to get a play licensed if it dealt with drugs, unless as a warning 
    against their abuse&mdash;which is exactly what the play imports.&nbsp; The mere mention of morphine 
    had so disturbed his judgement that he failed to realize that fact.</p>
    <p>He interpreted her abject wail, the cynical cry of a damned soul, as a defiant assertion of 
    compensation for her disappointments in all else.</p>
    <p>The mere mention!&nbsp; There is not a line in the whole play to support any advocacy or excuse 
    for her suicidal habit.</p>
