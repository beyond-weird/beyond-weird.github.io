    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXIX: Progress</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You will certainly have to have an india-rubber medal for persistence:
    this is the nth time that you have tried to catch me contradicting myself.</p>

    <p>Well, so I do, and must, every time I make any statement whatever, as
    has been shown several times in this chatty little interchange of views.
    But that is not what you mean.</p>

    <p>You say&mdash;permit me to condense your more than somewhat tautological,
    pleonastic, prolix, diffuse and incoherent elucubrations!&mdash;that the
    whole idea of the Great Order is based on faith in Progress.&nbsp; The doctrine 
    of successive aeons is nothing else.&nbsp; The system of training is nothing 
    else.&nbsp; Nothing, in fact, is anything else.&nbsp; Maugr‚ this and in
    despite thereof (you continue, with a knavish gleam in your hither eye)
    I am everlastingly throwing down the whole jerry-built castle by my
    cynical reflections.&nbsp; (Some one&mdash;Anthony Hope in a lucid moment, I
    think&mdash;says that cynicism is always a confession of failure&mdash;&quot;sour
    grapes.&quot;)&nbsp; Maybe, some of the time.&nbsp; But the explanation is very 
    simple, and you ought to have been able to think it out for yourself.&nbsp; It is 
    a question of the "Universe of Discourse," of Perspective.&nbsp; An engineer
    may swear himself ultra-marine in the map all the time at the daily
    mistakes and mishaps that go on all the time under his nose, yet at
    dinner tell his friends complacently that the bridge is going up better
    than he ever expected.</p>

    <p>Just so, my gibes are directed at incidents; but my heart's truth is
    fixed on the grand spiral.</p>

    <p>All the same, I am glad you wrote; it is a text for a little sermon
    that I have had in mind for a long while on the <em>conditions</em> of progress.</p>

    <p>Number One is obviously Irregularity, Eccentricity, Disorder, the Revolutionary 
    Spirit, Experiment.</p>

    <p>I have no patience whatever with Utopia-mongers.&nbsp; Biology simply shouts
    at us that the happy contented community, everyone with his own (often
    highly specialized) job, nobody in need, nobody in danger, is necessarily
    stagnant.&nbsp; Termites and other ants, bees, beavers; these and many another 
    have produced perfect systems.&nbsp;  What is the first characteristic?&nbsp;
    Stupidity.&nbsp; &quot;Where there is no vision, the people shall perish.&quot;&nbsp; 
    What is the Fighter Termite to do, after he has been blocked out of his home?&nbsp;
    None of these communities possess any resource at all against any unforeseen 
    unfavourable change of circumstance.&nbsp; (We look rather like that just now 
    at the end of 1944 e.v.)&nbsp; Nor does anyone of them show any achievement;
    having got to the end of their biological tether, they stay out, without an aim, 
    an idea, an effort.&nbsp; The leech, an insufferable pest in its belt&mdash;it 
    has killed off tiger, rhinoceros, anything with a nostril!&mdash;is the curse 
    of our military station at Lebong&mdash;or was when I was there.&nbsp; At Darjeeling, 
    a few hundred feet higher, devil a one!&nbsp; They have no one to think: now how can 
    we flourish up higher?&nbsp; Those old forlorn-hope Miss-Sahibs&mdash;how wide are 
    their nostrils!&nbsp; Then&mdash;how?</p>

    <p>Consider for a moment our own Empire.&nbsp; How did that spread all over the
    planet?&nbsp; It was the imaginative logic, the audacity, the adroit adaptability, 
    of the Adventurer that blasted the road.</p>

    <p>The sunny Socialist smiles his superior smile, and condescends to
    instruct us.&nbsp; That was an unfortunate, though perhaps sometimes necessary, 
    stage in the perfection of Society.</p>

    <p>Something in that.&nbsp; But there are other kinds of Adventure.&nbsp; My imagination 
    can set no limit to the possibilities of Science, or of Art: our own Great Work is 
    evidence of that.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I looked through an interview with the least brain-bound
    of these ruminators&mdash;poor old, dear old G. for gaga Bernard Shaw.</p>

    <p>The artist, said he, was a special case. he should have a nice easy
    job, three or four hours a day, and be free for the rest of it to devote
    himself to his Art.  I wonder how much of his own work would have seen
    daylight if he had been tied to some silly robot soul-killing, nerve-
    crushing, mind-infuriating routine job for even one half-hour a day!
    When I am on a piece of work, I grudge the time for eating; and when
    it's done, I need the absolute relaxation of leisured luxury.</p>

    <p>Then what of the Work itself?&nbsp; If the Idea be truly new and important,
    God help it!&nbsp; The whole class of men affected jump on it with one accord,
    if haply they may crush it in the germ.&nbsp; Read a little of the History of
    Medicine!&nbsp; Any man who shows a sign of independent thought is watched,
    is thwarted.&nbsp; He persists and is threatened and bullied.&nbsp; He persists;
    every engine of oppression is set in motion against him.&nbsp; Then something 
    snaps; either they succeed in killing him (Ross, who defeated malaria, nearly 
    starved to death) or they make him a baronet, or a peer, or make his death a 
    Day of National Mourning, and bury him in the Pantheon&mdash;&quot;<em>auc grands 
    hommes la patrie reconnaissante</em>&quot;&mdash;like Pasteur after one of the 
    most infamous campaigns of persecution in history.</p>

    <p>Then, of course, entertainment must be standardized.&nbsp; It costs money to produce; and 
    who will produce anything which can only appeal to the very few&mdash;to none at all, soon, 
    if these swine have their way.&nbsp; So, if it <em>is</em> new, <em>is</em> original, <em>is</em> 
    worth one's while, it <em>must</em> be ignored.</p>

    <p>Besides, being new and incomprehensible to the great Us, it may be dangerous, and must be suppressed.</p>

    <p>In all literature I know no pages so terrifying as those in Louis
    Marlow's <em>Mr. Amberthwaite</em>, which describe his dream.&nbsp; I wish I could
    quote it, with Sinai as the orchestra; never mind, read it again.&nbsp; And
    we are on the way&mdash;far on the way&mdash;to That!</p>

    <p>Now, obviously, the robot education, robot textbooks stuffed in by robot
    teachers, will have done wonders with the help of the bovine well-being
    to produce a race of robot boys.</p>

    <p>All independence, all imagination, all spirit of Adventure, will have
    been ground down and rolled out smooth by this ghastly engine.&nbsp; But&mdash;</p>

    <p>Nature is not so easily beaten; a few boys and girls will somehow
    escape, and either by instinct or by observation, have the sense to
    keep secret.  Now whatever their own peculiar genius may select as their
    line, they will realise that nothing is possible in any way while the
    accursed system stands.&nbsp; Their first duty is Revolt.&nbsp; And presently
    some one will come along with the wit and the will and the weapon, and
    blow the whole most damnable bag of tricks sky-high.</p>

    <p>We had better busy ourselves about this while it is still possible to
    get back to freedom without universal bloodshed.</p>

    <p>&quot;All right, Master, you win!  Now give us your own idea of Utopia.&quot;</p>

    <p>An Utopia to end Utopias?&nbsp; Very good, so I will.&nbsp; Education, to 
    begin with; well, you've had all that in another letter.&nbsp; The main thing 
    to remember is that I want every individual taught as such, according to
    his own special qualities.&nbsp; Then, teach them both sides of every 
    question: history, for example, as the play of economic forces, also, as
    due to the intervention of Divine Providence, or of &quot;Sports&quot; of 
    genius: and so for the rest.&nbsp; Train them to doubt&mdash;and to dare!</p>

    <p>Then, somehow, as large a number of the most promising rebels should be
    selected to lead a life of luxury and leisure.&nbsp; Let every country, by
    dint of honouring its old traditions, be as different as possible from
    every other.&nbsp; Restore the &quot;Grand tour,&quot; or rather, the roving 
    Englishman of the Nineteenth Century.&nbsp; Entrust them with the secrets of 
    discipline, of authority, or power.&nbsp; Hardship and danger in full measure: 
    and responsibility.</p>

    <p>A great deal of such material will be as disgustingly wasted as it has
    been in the past; and there will be much abuse of privilege.&nbsp; But this
    must be allowed and allowed for; no very great harm will result, as the
    weak and vicious will weed themselves out.</p>

    <p>The pure gold will repay us ten thousandfold.&nbsp; You ask examples?  With
    us, the Elizabethan and the Victorian periods stand out.&nbsp; What is most
    wanted is opportunity and reward.&nbsp; Under Victoria there was some&mdash;taste
    the late Samuel Smiles Esquire, D.D. (wasn't he?)&mdash;but not enough, and
    Industrialism, the mother and nurse of Socialism, was destroying the
    soul of the people.</p>

    <p>In my not very maternal remarks on Mother-love, was included the substance 
    of the one wise saying of my pet American lunatic &quot;You can't get past their 
    biology.&quot;&nbsp; This is so true, and so disheartening, that it arouses me 
    to combat.&nbsp; Must we for ever be bound to the inconvenient habit of sows and 
    cabbages?&nbsp; I pick up the glove.</p>

    <p>Isn't it Aldous Huxley who says somewhere that some species or other
    can never develop higher powers because its brain is shut in by its
    carapace?&nbsp; I thought this too, long ago; and I went into interminable
    conferences with my old friend, Professor Buckmaster; I wanted to
    extend brain surgery to produce the phenomena of Yoga.&nbsp; Also, I wondered
    what would happened if we wedged apart the sections of the cranium at, or
    shortly after, birth, so as to prevent them closing and giving the brain
    a chance to grow.</p>

    <p>I suspect, by the way, that something of the sort is done in China and
    Burma; but the object is merely to produce megalocephalic idiots as a
    valuable addition to the financial resources of the family.</p>

    <p>I thought that modern physiology, with its great recent advances in
    knowledge of the specialized functions of the brain, might quite
    possibly succeed in producing genius.</p>

    <p>You would not surprise me if you told me that something of the sort is
    being tried in Russia, with its Communism modelled so closely on that
    of Ivan the Terrible at the moment, war or no war!&nbsp; <em>Qui vivra verra</em>.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, all that I really want you to get into your head &quot;sunning over
    with little curls&quot; is that Progress demands Anarchy tempered by Common
    Sense, and that the most formidable obstacle is this Biology.</p>

    <p>The experience of the Magician and the Yogi does suggest that there is
    room in the human brain as at present constituted for almost limitless
    expansion.  At least our system of Training is more immediately practical 
    than digging up our Corpora Quadragenina and planting them in a
    Monkey's Medulla just to see what will come of it.&nbsp; So put down that
    bread-knife!</p>
