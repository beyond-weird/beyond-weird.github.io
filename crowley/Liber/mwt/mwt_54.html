    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LIV: &quot;On Meanness&quot;</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Yes, indeed!&nbsp; As you surmise, the injunction to &quot;buy the egg of a
    perfectly black hen without haggling&quot; is another way of putting the
    Parable of the Pearl of Great Price; a much better way.  For the Pearl-buyer 
    did think of equating the values, which is precisely what one
    must not do.&nbsp; That Egg is <em>incommensurable</em> with money.</p>

    <p>(Further, the saying teaches one to insist on perfection; the hen must
    not have one tinge of aught but black in any feather.)</p>

    <p>However, that is neither here not there; what you want me to do is to
    discuss Economy in its magical aspects.</p>

    <p>Very good: to begin, Economy does not mean thrift or cheeseparing.&nbsp; It
    means: the law of the house.&nbsp; In practice, one may say &quot;management.&quot;&nbsp;
    Finances are only one branch of the science, just as truckling, blackmail, 
    graft, treachery and double-dealing are only components of modern statesmanship.</p>

    <p>All the same, I propose to talk in terms of money, because everyone has thought 
    a good deal about it.&nbsp; Examples are abundant, ideas easy to express, and 
    one can be concise and clear without danger of misunderstanding.</p>

    <p>So let us call this letter Moralizing on Meanness!</p>

    <p>Firstly (dearly beloved brethern) meanness is flat contradiction to the
    Teaching of <em>The Book of the Law</em>.&nbsp; For &quot;The word of Sin is Restriction....&quot;
    and meanness is plainly a most flagrant case of Restriction.&nbsp; Also, there
    is nearly always an element of Fear in meanness; at least, I would like
    to bet that 95% of mean people originally became so because they foresaw a 
    friendless and penniless old age.&nbsp; And fear is particularly forbidden in 
    the Book: II, 16</a> &quot;...fear not to undergo the curses....&quot;&nbsp; Waxing
    in wrath, III, 17</a> goes on: &quot;...Fear not at all; 
    fear neither men nor Fates, nor gods, nor anything.&nbsp; Money fear not, nor laughter of the folk
    folly, nor any other power in heaven or upon the earth or under the earth....&quot;&nbsp;
    Then pretty well all the positive injunctions imply reckless enthusiasm.&nbsp;
    &quot;Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and
    fire, are of us.&quot;&nbsp; (AL II,20)</p>

    <p>What's more, meanness does not even pay!  I propose to tell you why this
    is, and how things work out.</p>

    <p>What <em>is</em> money?&nbsp; A medium of exchange devised to facilitate the transac-
    tion of business.&nbsp; Oil in the engine.&nbsp; Very good, then; if instead of
    letting it flow as freely and smoothly as possible, you baulk its very
    nature; you prevent it from doing its True Will.&nbsp; So every restriction
    (that word again!) on the exchange of wealth is a direct violation of
    the Law of Thelema.</p>

    <p>How stupid is this tightening of the purse-strings!&nbsp; Parable No. Three,
    &quot;The fairy Bank Note.&quot;</p>

    <p>One evening a man walked into an inn and asked for hospitality.&nbsp; In the
    morning, when his bill came, he found he had nothing but a &pound;100 note.
    &quot;I'm afraid I've no change till the Banks open.&quot; &quot;Oh, stick to it&mdash;
    I'll be back next week&mdash;I've enough petrol to take me home.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;Handy,&quot; though Boniface, &quot;that will just square my brewer.&quot;&nbsp;
    That reminded the brewer to pay his cornchandler, who had been worrying him
    to settle.&nbsp; He wasn't nasty about it; he really needed the money for
    his farmer, a worthy man who wanted to build some new outhouses, and
    the builder couldn't give any credit because he was being pressed by
    the man who supplied his materials, a man in great trouble on account
    of his wife's long illness, and the necessity of an immediate and very
    expensive operation.</p>

    <p>So the doctor went round, very lordly, to the local estate agent, and
    made the first payment on the new house he had wanted for so long.
    &quot;Hullo! Hullo!&quot; laughed the agent; &quot;here we are again.&nbsp; It's 
    curious, but I paid out that note only ten days ago!&quot;</p>

    <p>So there were seven hampered and worried men all made happy, and the
    Bank note was in the hands of its original holder.</p>

    <p>Now then for True Story No. 1.&nbsp; It is my own experience.&nbsp; When, nearly
    40 years ago, I walked through Spain, accompanied only by a single chela,
    there was little paper money in use, at least in the rather primitive
    places which we favoured.&nbsp; The currency was confined to the silver peso,
    and its fractions.&nbsp; About 90 miles north of Madrid, we found, one fine
    morning, that our well-meant attempt to pay our bill at the posada threw
    a bombshell into the works: the people of the Inn jabbered and gesticulated 
    among themselves for about half an hour before they produced our receipt, and 
    bade us Hasta la vista!</p>

    <p>Next day, the same thing, rather worse.&nbsp; The day after, worse still;
    and we saw that they were disputing about the coins that we had handed
    over.&nbsp; Finally, about 20 miles from Madrid, they wouldn't take our money
    at all!  Instead, the pointed out that we were English gentlemen, and
    they would be eternally honoured and grateful if we would send the money
    from Madrid!</p>

    <p>On arrival at that city, we noticed long queues of people besieging the
    Banks; I put my finger to my nose, and said Aha!</p>

    <p>But, sitting down at a caf&eacute;, oh no! not at all!&nbsp; Pesos were passing
    without question.&nbsp; Well, well!&nbsp; So I got into conversation with a
    knowledgeable-looking bloke, and he told me the whole story.  It seemed
    that the Director of Customs had a brother in Mexico D.F. who manufactured
    brass bedsteads.&nbsp; The uprights of these were packed with forged pesos of
    Fernando VII and one other king&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;made of the same
    standard silver alloy as the genuine coins, and so well executed that the
    only way to tell the false was that they looked newer than they should
    have been, in view of the date!  And so (continued my informant) there
    was a panic, and no one would take any money at all, and the city was
    dying on its feet!&nbsp; So the Government gave orders to the Banks to change
    any coins soever for their equivalent in freshly-minted money&mdash;that's
    what those queues are&mdash;and &quot;every one is happy again.&quot;&nbsp; 
    &quot;But,&quot; I objected, &quot;I see you have some old coins.&quot;&nbsp; 
    He laughed.&nbsp; &quot;Those one-eyed mules at the Banks!&nbsp; All 
    foolishness!&nbsp; Days ago we all agreed to take any money without 
    question&mdash;and as long as we all do that, why, nobody's hurt!&quot;</p>

    <p>I am not pretending that there is anything new about any of this; the
    whole theory of credit implies the probability of some such happenings.</p>

    <p>(During the Skirmish [1914-1918 e.v.] some small town in Northern Mexico
    got cut off by warring presidential brigands from the rest of the country,
    and got on perfectly well for a year or more without any money or commerce
    at all, on a basis of good-neighbourly feeling.&nbsp; Similar principles at
    Cefal; three years without a single quarrel about money.&nbsp; We used to
    say: &quot;There's no harm in money until you begin to count it!&quot;)&nbsp; 
    Trouble comes from Fear, and from Restriction.</p>

    <p>When I first landed in the U.S.A. (1900) I noticed instantly that practically 
    everybody seemed to have money to burn, defying statistics.&nbsp; &quot;Oh,
    that's simple!&quot; explained a banker to whom I mentioned it; &quot;in this
    country we reckon that money circulates 9 times as fast as in England.&nbsp;
    One dollar does the work of nine.&quot;&nbsp; Then, a year later at San Francisco,
    everything seemed very dear.&quot; Why?&nbsp; In S.F. one hardly ever saw a copper
    coin; the nickel (2 1/2d) was the smallest in practical use.&nbsp; Going on
    to Honolulu, it was twice as bad; and there the dime (5d) was the
    smallest coin one ever saw.&nbsp; Somehow, it made for stickiness.&nbsp; When one
    hesitates to pay money out, one cannot expect other people to feel otherwise.&nbsp; 
    So everything becomes increasingly constipated.&nbsp; I am not denying the virtues 
    of thrift, but it's a long and tedious business; and all the big fortunes are made 
    by shrewd gambling.&nbsp; Even if your policy be &quot;small profits,&quot; it is 
    a failure unless it ensures &quot;quick returns.&quot;&nbsp; This is the deeper meaning 
    of the proverb &quot;time is money.&quot;</p>

    <p>Then, isn't there a little Bonus?  Isn't it worth something to have a
    pleasant life, and to have people like you.  It leaps to the eye if one
    is a &quot;tightwad;&quot; the Saturnian constriction shows itself in a myriad
    ways.&nbsp; &quot;The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth shall
    be watered also himself.&quot;</p>

    <p>Now, then expand your thought; from he consideration of money (which
    we chose merely for convenience of discussion) apply these principles
    to the spheres of all the other planets.&nbsp; You will very soon heighten
    the enjoyment of life beyond all measure and belief!</p>
