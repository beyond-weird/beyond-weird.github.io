    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XVIII:The Importance of our Conventional Greetings, etc.</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>From time to time I have exhorted you with mine accustomed matchless
    eloquence never to neglect the prescribed Greetings: but I think it just
    as well to collect the various considerations connected with their use&mdash;and 
    in &quot;Greetings&quot; I include "saying Will" before set meals, the four
    daily adorations of the Sun (Liber CC, vel Resh</a>) 
    and the salutation of Our Lady the Moon.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;
    I propose to deal with the general object of the combined rituals, not with 
    the special virtues of each separately.</p>

    <p>The practice of Liber III vel Jugorum</a><a href="#ac1">*</a> 
    is the complement of these grouped customs.&nbsp; By sharp physical self-chastisement when 
    you think, say, or do whatever it is that you have set yourself to avoid doing, you set a 
    sentry at the gate of your mind ready to challenge all comers, and so you acquire
    the habit of being on the alert.&nbsp; Keep this in mind, and you will have no
    difficulty in following the argument of this letter.</p>

    <p>When you are practicing Dharana<a href="#ac2">&#134;</a> concentration, you allow 
    yourself so many minutes.&nbsp; It is a steady, sustained effort.&nbsp; The mind 
    constantly struggles to escape control.&nbsp; (I hope you remember the sequence of 
    &quot;breaks.&quot; In case you don't, I summarize them.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Immediate physical interruptions: Asana should stop these.</li>
      <li>Things that are &quot;on you mind.&quot;</li>
      <li>Reverie, and &quot;Wouldn't it help if I were to&mdash; ?&quot;</li>
      <li>Atmospherics&mdash;e.g. voices apparently from some alien source.</li>
      <li>Aberrations of the control itself; and the result itself.&nbsp; (Remember 
      the practice of some Hindu schools: &quot;Not that, not that!&quot; to whatever 
      it is the presents itself as Tat Sat&mdash;reality, truth).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Need I remind you how urgent the wish to escape will assuredly become,
    how fantastic are the mind's devices and excuses, amounting often to
    deliberate revolt?&nbsp; In Kandy I broke away in a fury, and dashed down to
    Colombo with the intention of painting the very air as red as the betel-
    spittle on the pavements!&nbsp; But after three days of futile search for
    satisfying debauchery I came back to my horses, and, sure enough, it was
    merely that I had gone stale; the relaxation soothed and steadied me; I
    resumed the discipline with redoubled energy, and Dhyana dawned before a
    week had elapsed.</p>

    <p>I mention this because it is the <em>normal</em> habit of the mind to organize
    these counter-attacks that makes their task so easy.&nbsp; What you need is a
    mind that will help rather than hinder your Work by its <em>normal</em> function.</p>

    <p>This is where these Greetings, and Will-sayings, and Adorations come in.</p>

    <p>It is not a concentration-practice proper; I haven't a good word for it.&nbsp;
    &quot;Background-concentration&quot; or &quot;long-distance-concentration&quot; are clumsy,
    and not too accurate.&nbsp; It is really rather like a public school education.&nbsp;
    One is not constantly &quot;doing a better thing that one has ever done;&quot; one
    is not dropping one's eye-glass every two minutes, or being a little gentleman 
    in the act of brushing one's hair.&nbsp; The point is that one trains oneself to 
    react properly at any moment of surprise.&nbsp; It must become &quot;second nature&quot; 
    for &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; to spring to the forefront 
    of the mind when one is introduced to a stranger, or comes down to breakfast, or hears the 
    telephone bell, or observes the hour of the adoration, (these are to be the superficial 
    reactions, like instinctively rising when a lady enters the room), or, at the other end,
    in moments of immediate peril, or of sudden apprehension, or when in one's meditation, 
    one approaches the deepest strata.</p>

    <p>One need not be dogmatic about the use of these special words.&nbsp; One might
    choose a formula to represent one's own particular True Will.&nbsp; It is a
    little like Cato, (or Scipio, was it?)<!-- it was Cato --> who concluded every speech, whether
    about the Regulations of the Roman Bath or the proposal to reclaim a marsh of the Maremma, 
    with the words: &quot;And moreover, in my opinion, Carthage ought to be destroyed.&quot;</p>

    <p>Got it?</p>

    <p>You teach the mind to push your thought automatically to the very thing
    from which it was trying to wander.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, I get you Stephen!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But,
    Uncle Dudley, come clean, do you always do all this yourself?&nbsp; Don't you
    sometimes feel embarrassed, or fear that you may destroy the effect of
    your letter, or &quot;create a scene&quot; in the public street when you suddenly
    stop and perform these incomprehensible antics, or simply forget about
    the whole thing?&quot;</p>

    <p>Yes, I do.</p>

    <p><em>Peccavi</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</em>.</p>

    <p>I am <em>not</em> your old and valued friend, Adam Qadmon, the Perfect Man.</p>

    <p>I am a pretty poor specimen.</p>

    <p>I am nothing to cable about to Lung Peng Choung, or Himi, or Monsalvat.</p>

    <p>I do forget now and again; though, I am glad to say, not nearly as often
    as I used to do.&nbsp; (As the habit is acquired, it tends to strengthen
    itself).&nbsp; But often I deliberately omit to do my duty.&nbsp; I do funk it.&nbsp;
    I do resent it.&nbsp; I do feel that it's too much bother.</p>

    <p>As I said above, Adam Qadman is <em>not</em> my middle name.</p>

    <p>Well now, have I any shadow of an excuse?&nbsp; Yes, I have, after a fashion;
    I don't think it good manners to force my idiosyncrasies down people's
    throats, and I don't want to appear more of an eccentric than I need.&nbsp;
    It might detract from my personal influence, and so actually harm the
    Work that I am trying to perform.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

    <p>&quot;Yes, that's all very well, Alibi Ike; you are exceedingly well know as
    a Scripture-quoting Satan, as a Past-Master in self-justification.
    Trained from infancy by the Plymouth Brethern, who for casuistry leave
    the Jesuits at the post!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, yes, but &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;."

    <p>&quot;You needn't but me no buts, you old he-goat!&nbsp; Wasn't there once a Jonas
    Hanway, the first man to sport an umbrella?&nbsp; Wouldn't your practice be natural, 
    and right, and the cream of the cream of good manners as soon as a few hundred people 
    of position took to doing it?&nbsp; And wouldn't Thomas, Richard, and Henry, three 
    months later, make a point of doing the same as their betters?&quot;&nbsp; 
    (That was Conscience speaking.)</p>

    <p>All right, you win.</p>
