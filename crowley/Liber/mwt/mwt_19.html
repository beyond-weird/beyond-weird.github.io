    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XIX: The Act of Truth</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>It seems that last Wednesday I so far forgot myself as to refer to the &quot;Act 
    of Truth&quot; in conversation, and never mentioned what it is when it's at home, 
    or why anyone should perform it, or what happens when one does perform it!</p>

    <p>All right, I will remedy that; luckily, it is a very simple matter;
    very important, perfectly paradoxical and devastatingly effective.</p>

    <p>Analysed, it is to make the assumption that something which seems very
    wrong is actually all right, that an eager wish is an accomplished fact.
    a reasonable anxiety, entirely unfounded&mdash;and to act accordingly.</p>

    <p>For instance, I'm in some desolate place, dependent for my food supply
    on a weekly messenger.&nbsp; If he is a day late, it is awkward; if two, it
    means hardship; if three, serious risk.&nbsp; One is naturally anxious as the
    day approaches; perhaps the weather, or some similar snag, makes it
    likely that he will be late.&nbsp; From one cause or another, I have rather
    exceeded my ration.&nbsp; There is nothing I can do about it, materially.</p>

    <p>The sensible course of action is to draw in my horns, live on the minimun, 
    necessary to life, <em>which involves cutting the day's work down to
    almost nothing</em>, and hope for the best, expecting the worst.</p>

    <p>But there is a Magical mode of procedure.&nbsp; You say to yourself: I am
    here to do this Work in accordance with my true Will.&nbsp; The Gods have got
    to see to it that I'm not baulked by any blinking messenger.&nbsp; (But take
    care They don't overhear you; They might mistake it for Hybris, or presumption.&nbsp;
    Do it all in the Sign of Silence, under the aegis of Harpocrates, the &quot;Lord of 
    Defence and Protection&quot;; be careful to assume his God-form, as standing on two 
    crocodiles.&nbsp; Then you increase your consumption, and at the same time put in a 
    whole lot of extra Work.&nbsp; If you perform this &quot;Act of Truth&quot; properly, 
    with <em>genuine</em> conviction that nothing can go wrong, your messenger will arrive 
    a day early, and bring an extra large supply.</p>

    <p>This, let me say at once, is very difficult, especially at first, until
    one has gained confidence in the efficacy of the Formula; and it is very
    nastily easy to &quot;fake.&quot;&nbsp; Going through the motions (as they say) is more
    futile here than in most cases, and the results of messing it up are
    commonly disastrous.<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> Do not be misled by any apparent superficial resemblance to 
    &quot;Christian Science&quot; and &quot;Coueism&quot; and their cackling kin.&nbsp; 
    They miss every essential feature of the formula.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>You must invent your act to suit your case, every time; suppose you expect a 
    cable next Friday week, transferring cash to your account.&nbsp; You need $500 
    to make up an important payment, and you don't know whether they will send even 
    $200.&nbsp; What are you going to do about it?&nbsp; Skimp, and save your expenses, 
    and make yourself miserable and incapable of vigorous thought or action?&nbsp; You 
    <em>may</em> succeed in saving enough to swing the deal; but you won't get a penny 
    beyond the amount actually needed&mdash;and look at the cost in moral grandeur!</p>

    <p>No, go and stand yourself a champagne luncheon, and stroll up Bond Street
    with an 8 1/2 &quot;Hoyo de Monterey,&quot; and squander $30 on some utterly useless
    bauble.&nbsp; Then the $500 will swell to $1000, and arrive two days early at that!</p>

    <p>There are one or two points to consider very carefully indeed before you start:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote><ol>
      <li>The proposed Act must be <em>absurd</em>; it won't do at all if by some
      fluke, however unlikely, it might accomplish your aim.&nbsp; For instance, 
      it's no use backing an outsider.&nbsp; There must be no causal link.</li>
      <li>The Act must be one which makes the situation definitely worse.&nbsp;
      <em>E.g.</em>: suppose you are counting on a new dress to make a hit at a 
      Reception, and doubt whether it is so much better than your present best, 
      or whether it will be finished in time.&nbsp; Then, wear that present best 
      to-night (wet, of course), knowing you are sure to soil it.</li>
      <li>Obviously, all the usual conditions of a Magical Operation apply in 
      this as in all cases; your aim must conform with your True Will, and all 
      that; but there is one curious point about an Act of Truth: this, that 
      one should resort to it only when there is no other method possible.&nbsp; 
      In the explorer's case, above, it won't do if he has any means of hurrying 
      up the messenger.</li>
    </ol></blockquote>

    <p>It seems to me that the above brief sketch should suffice an intelligent
    and imaginative student like yourself; but if any point remains darkling,
    let me know, and I will follow up with a postscript.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I thought it might help you if I were to make a few experiments.
    I have done so.&nbsp; Result: this is much more difficult and delicate an
    affair than I had thought when I wrote this letter.  For instance, one
    single thought of a &quot;second string&quot;&mdash;e.g. &quot;if it fails, I had better do
    so and so&quot;&mdash;is enough to kill the while operation stone dead.&nbsp; Of course,
    I am totally out of practice; but, even so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
