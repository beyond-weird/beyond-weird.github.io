    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXVI: Vampires</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>So you want me to tell you all about Vampires?&nbsp; Vampire yourself!</p>

    <p>I ask you, how does this come within the scope of your enquiries?&nbsp; Is
    this information essential to your Accomplishment of the Great Work?
    As the Government might say &quot;Is your journey really necessary?&quot;</p>

    <p>So musing, I rang you up for details.&nbsp; Vampires, you say, might be a
    temptation to yourself, or they might sap your energy.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; 
    I will tell you the little I know.</p>

    <p>Listen to Eliphas L&eacute;vi!&nbsp; He warns us against a type of person, 
    fearless and cold-blooded, who seems to have the power to cast a sudden chill,
    merely by entering the room, upon the gayest party ever assembled.</p>

    <p>T&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, they shake one's resolution, kill one's enthusiasm, 
    devitalize one's faith and courage.</p>

    <p>Yes, we all know such people.&nbsp; Mercury, by the way, is the planet
    responsible.&nbsp; I have examined a considerable number of nativities, both
    of murderers and of people murdered; in both cases it was not a &quot;malefic&quot; 
    that did the dirty work, but poor tiny innocent silvery-shining Mercury!</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;Fie for same, you naughty planet!<br>
      You're the blighter that began it.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>is it not John Henry Newman that sang of Lucifer?&nbsp; I doubt it.</p>

    <p>You, however, are thinking more of the vampire of romance.&nbsp; Bram Stoker's
    <em>Dracula</em> and its kindred.&nbsp; This is a splendidly well-documented book, 
    by the way; he got his &quot;facts&quot; and their legal and magical surroundings,
    perfectly correct.</p>

    <p>It is easy enough to laugh at vampires if you live in Upper Tooting, or
    Surbiton, or one of those places where no self-respection Vampire would
    wish to be seen.&nbsp; But in a lonely mountain village in Bulgaria you might
    feel differently about it!&nbsp; You should remember, incidentally, that the
    evidence for vampires is as strong as for pretty well anything else in
    the world.&nbsp; There are innumerable records extant of legal proceedings
    wherein the most sober, responsible, worthy and well-respected citizens,
    including the advocates and judges, investigated case after case with
    the utmost minuteness, with the most distinguished surgeons and anatomists 
    to swear to the clinical details.</p>

    <p>Endless is the list of well-attested cases of bodies dug up after months
    of burial which have been found not merely flourishing with all the
    lines of life, but gorged with fresh blood.</p>

    <p>I cannot help feeling that all the superior-person explanations&mdash;which
    explain nothing&mdash;about collective hysteria and superstition and wish
    fulfillment and the rest of the current tomfool jargon, are just about
    as hard to believe as the original straight forward stories.</p>

    <p>The man who shook his head on being shown a giraffe, and said &quot;I don't
    believe it,&quot; is quite on a par with he pontifical wiseacres of Wimpole Street.</p>

    <p>It is egomaniac vanity that prompts disbelief in phenomena merely
    because they lie outside the infinitesimally minute pilule of one's own
    personal experience.</p>

    <p>When I crossed the Burma-China frontier for the first time, who should
    I meet but our Consul at Tengyueh, the admirable Litton, who had by
    sheer brains and personality turned the whole province of Yunnan into
    his own Vice-royalty?  We lunched together on the grass, and I hastened
    to dig into the goldmine of his knowledge of the country.&nbsp; About the
    third or fourth thing he said to me was this: &quot;Remember! whatever
    anyone tells you about China is true.&quot;&nbsp; No words have ever impressed
    me more deeply; they sank right in and were illuminated by daily
    experience until they had justified themselves a thousand times over.</p>

    <p>That goes for Vampires!</p>

    <p>Oh yeah! (you vulgarly interpolate) and how does it go with the Master's
    unfathomably sage discourse on Doubt.</p>

    <p>Sister, you're loopy!&nbsp; Sister, if I may doubt all the people who have
    been to Africa or the Zoo and seen that giraffe, why must I cling with
    simple childlike trust to the people that say they've been all over
    Hell and parts of Kansas, and haven't seen one, and <em>therefore</em> such
    things cannot possibly be?&nbsp; Of the two dogmatic assertions, I should
    unquestionably prefer the positive statement to the negative.</p>

    <p>In 1916, I was the first trained scientific observer to record the
    appearance commonly called &quot;St Elmo's fire&quot; indiscreetly revealing
    this fact in a letter to the <em>New York Times</em>.&nbsp; I was pestered for 
    the next six months and more by professors of physics (and the rest) from
    all over the U.S.A.&nbsp; The Existence of the phenomenon had been doubted
    until then because of certain theoretical difficulties.&nbsp; That, sister,
    is the point.&nbsp; If a statement is hard to reconcile with the whole body
    of evidence on the laws of the subject, it is rightly received with suspicion.</p>

    <p>A moment with great Huxley, and his illustration of the centaur in
    Piccadilly, reported to him (he humorously hypothesizes) by Professor
    Owen.&nbsp; What occasions Huxley's doubt, and inspires the questions by
    means of which he seeks to confirm or to discredit it?&nbsp; Just this, no
    more: here is the head and torso of a man fitted to the shoulders of
    a horse; how are the mechanical adjustments effected?</p>

    <p>In the same strain, he pointed out that for an angel to have practicable
    wings as in Mediaeval pictures, the breast-bone would have to stand out
    some five feet in front of the body.&nbsp; (The poor fellow, of course, was
    densely ignorant of the mechanics of the Astral Plane.&nbsp; I am, for once,
    &quot;on the side of the angels.&quot;)<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <p>Am I digressing again?&nbsp; No, not really; I am just putting forward a
    case for keeping an open mind on the subject of Vampires, even of the
    Clan Dracula.</p>

    <p>But certainly there is little or no evidence of the existence of that
    species in England.</p>

    <p>How then is the subject in any way important to you?&nbsp; Thus, that 
    there are actually people running about all over the place, who actually
    possess, and exercise, faculties similar to those mentioned by L&eacute;vi, 
    but in much greater intensity, even of a kind far more formidable, and
    directed by malignant will.</p>

    <p>There is a mighty volume of theory and practice concerning this and
    cognate subjects which will be open to you when&mdash;and if&mdash;you attain
    the VIII&deg; of O.T.O. and become Pontiff and Epopt of the Illuminati.&nbsp;
    Further, when you enter the Sanctuary of the Gnosis&mdash;oh boy!&nbsp; Or, more
    accurately, oh girl!</p>

    <p>Not that the O.T.O. is a Young Ladies' and Gentlemen's Seminary for
    Tuition in Vampirism,<a href="#1">1</a> with a Chair (hardly suitable) 
    for Werwolves, and Beds of Justice&mdash;that sounds more apt&mdash;for 
    Incubi and Succubi;<a href="#2">2</a> far from it!&nbsp; But the forces 
    of Nature employed in these presumably abominable practices are similar 
    or identical.</p>

    <p>The doctrine of "Vital Force" has been so long and so completely
    exploded that I hardly need to tell you that in some still undiscovered
    (or, rather, unpublished) and unmeasured form it is certainly a fact.
    Haven't I told you one time how we nearly starved on Iztaccihuatl with
    dozens of tinned foods all round us, they being ancient; of how one
    can get drunk on half a dozen oysters; of how the best meat I have
    ever eaten is half-raw Himalyan sheep, cut up and thrown on the glowing 
    ashes before rigor mortis had set in?<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;
    There <em>is</em> a difference between living and dead protoplasm, whether 
    the chemist and his fellow twilight-gropers admit it or no.&nbsp; I do 
    not blame the ignorance of these fumblers with frost-bitten fingers; b
    ut they make themselves conspicuously assinine when they flaunt that 
    ignorance as the Quintessence of Knowledge; Boeotian bombast!</p>

    <p>There <em>are</em> forms of Energy, their Order too subtle to have been properly
    measured hitherto, which underlie and can, within certain limits, direct
    the gross chemical and physical changes of the body.&nbsp; To deny this is
    to be flung headlong into the arms of Animal Automatism.&nbsp; Huxley's arguments 
    for this theory are precisely like those of Bishop Berkeley: unanswerable, but 
    unconvincing.&nbsp; This letter is <em>not</em>, to every comma, the ineluctable, 
    apodeictic, automatic, reaction to the stimulus of your question; and no one 
    can persuade me that it is.&nbsp; Of course that unpersuadability is equally a 
    factor in the equation; it is quite useless to try to &quot;answer back.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Only, it's silly!</p>

    <p>(And, in the meanwhile, the mathematical physicists are knocking the
    bottom clean out of their ship by shewing that causality itself is
    little more than a maniac's raving!)<!-- yes, go read Hume again, Aleister --></p>

    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> For all that, they move without flapping them.  As Swinburne says:</p>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;Swift without feet, and flying without wings.&quot;<a href="#4">4</a>
    </blockquote>

    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>So then, we may&mdash;at least!&mdash;get busy.&nbsp; It is easy enough to bore one's
    neighbour&mdash;look how I bore you!&nbsp; But that is usually an unintentional
    business.&nbsp; Is it possible to intensify the devitalizing process, so as to 
    weaken the victim physically, perhaps even almost to the point of death?&nbsp; Yes.</p>

    <p>How?  The traditional method is to get possession of some object or
    substance intimately connected with the victim.&nbsp; On this you work magically 
    so as to absorb its virtue.&nbsp; It is best if it was as recently as possible 
    part of his living tissue; for instance, a nail-paring, a hair plucked from his 
    head.&nbsp; Something still alive or nearly so, and still part of the complex of 
    energies that he included in his conception of his body.</p>

    <p>Best of all are fluids and secretions, notably blood and one other of
    supreme importance to the continuity of life.&nbsp; When you can get these
    still alive to their function, it is best of all.&nbsp; That is why it is
    not so highly recommended to tear out and devour the heart and liver
    of your next-door neighbour; you have gone far to destroy just that
    which is of most importance to you to keep alive.</p>

    <p>Doubtless you will reply with some apparent justice, indeed most plausible 
    is such ratiocination, that by taking into your own body, and so preserving 
    the life of, his heart and liver, the whole of his &quot;vital energies&quot; 
    will desert the sinking ship of the physical tissue, and rush to the lifeboat 
    provided by the vampire.&nbsp; Never forget that you confer an inestimable 
    benefit upon the victim by absorbing his lower point of Energy into your 
    higher.&nbsp; Read your <em>Magick</em>, Chapter XII!<a href="#5">5</a></p>

    <p>You say this strongly, my dear Sister in the Lord; your thesis is
    impeccably stated, your arguments are cogent, plangent, not to be
    repeated.&nbsp; But&mdash;this I pout to you most solemnly&mdash;<em>what 
    experimental evidence do you adduce</em>?  How many hearts, how many livers, 
    have been your spiritual sustenance?&nbsp; Have you excluded every source of 
    error?&nbsp; Have you&mdash;here, you know the routine; write it all down and 
    send it along to be vetted!</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, I once knew a lady of some seventy summers.&nbsp; She
    came of a noble Polish family; she was short, sturdy, rather plump but
    singularly agile; good-looking in a brutal sort of way.&nbsp; But&mdash;her eyes!
    For fifty years she had lived nearly all the year round in her chateau
    in Touraine.&nbsp; She had plenty of money, and had always surrounded her-
    self with a dozen or more boys and young men.&nbsp; (By young I mean up to
    forty).&nbsp; She not only looked twenty-five but she lived twenty-five.&nbsp; It
    was a genuine, natural, spontaneous twenty-five, not a gallant effort.
    She would dance the night through and go a long walk in the morning.
    You may apply to her for details of the treatment; I dare say she is
    still about, thought I did hear that she moved to South America when she
    saw 1914 coming.&nbsp; In any case, you have had some fairly plain hints so
    I can say in all simplicity, &quot;Go thou and do likewise!&quot;</p>

    <p>I think my old friend Claude Farr&egrave;re had more than an inkling of these
    matters; the idea of using young cellular tissue to fortify the old
    is plainly stated in <em>La maison des hommes vivants</em>; but as to the
    method of transmission his water was drawn form Wells (H.G.)</p>

    <p>After that&mdash;you will agree that I have written enough.</p>
