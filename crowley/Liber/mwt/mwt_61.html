    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXI: Power and Authority</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Thanks very much for your last letter.&nbsp; I expected no less.&nbsp; As soon 
    as anybody gets into a position of authority, even on a very small scale,
    their troubles begin on a very large one.</p>

    <p>Imagine, if you can, what I have been through in the last quarter of a
    century or more.&nbsp; My subordinates are always asking me for advancement
    in the Order; they think that if they were only members of the 266th
    degree everything in the garden would be lovely.&nbsp; They think that if
    they only possessed the secrets of the 148th degree they would be able
    to perform all those miracles which at present escape them.</p>

    <p>These poor fish!&nbsp; They do not understand the difference between Power
    and Authority.&nbsp; They do not understand that there are two kinds of
    degrees, altogether different.</p>

    <p>For instance, in the theory of the Church of Rome a bishop is a person
    on whom has been conferred the magical power to ordain priests.&nbsp; He may
    choose a totally unworthy person for such ordination, it makes no difference; 
    and the priest, however unworthy he may be, has only to go through the correct 
    formul&aelig; which perform the miracle of the Mass, for that miracle to be 
    performed.&nbsp; This is because in the Church we are dealing with a religious 
    as opposed to a magical or scientific qualification.&nbsp; If the Royal Society 
    elected a cobbler, as it could, it would not empower the New Fellow to perform 
    a boiling-point determination, or read a Vernier.</p>

    <p>In our own case, though Our authority is at least as absolute as that
    of the Pope and the Church of Rome, it does not confer upon me any
    power transferable to others by any act of Our will.&nbsp; Our own authority
    came to Us because it was earned, and when We confer grades upon other
    people Our gift is entirely nugatory unless the beneficiary has won his
    spurs.</p>

    <p>To put it in a slightly different form of words: Any given degree is,
    as it were, a seal upon a precise attainment; and although it may please
    Us to explain the secret or secrets of any given degree or degrees to
    any particular person or persons, it is not of the slightest effect un-
    less he prove in his own person the ability to perform those functions
    which all We have done is to give him the right to perform and the 
    Knowledge how to perform.</p>

    <p>The further you advance in the Order the more will you find yourself
    pestered by people who have simply failed to understand this point of
    Magical theory.</p>

    <p>Another thing is that the business of teaching itself is a very tricky
    one; even such simple matters as travelling on the astral plane are
    not to be attained by any amount of teaching unless the pupil has both
    the capacity and the energy as well as the theoretical and intellectual
    ability to carry out successfully the practices.&nbsp; (I have already said
    a good deal about this in my <a href="mwt_60.html">letter on Knack</a>.)</p>

    <p>I have thought it most important that you should impress upon everybody
    these points.&nbsp; It is absolutely pitiful to watch the vain struggle of
    the incompetent; they are so earnest, so sincere, so worthy in every
    way of every possible reward and yet they seem unable to advance a
    single step.</p>

    <p>There is another side to this matter which is really approximating to
    the criminal.&nbsp; There are any number of teachers and masters and bishops
    and goodness knows what else running around doing what is little better
    than peddling grades and degrees and secrets.&nbsp; Such practices are of
    course no better than common fraud.</p>

    <p>Please fix it firmly in you mind that with Us any degree, any position
    of authority, any kind of rank, is utterly worthless except when it is
    merely a seal upon the actual attainment or achievement.</p>

    <p>It must seem to you that I am beating a dead dog, that it is little
    better than waste of time for me to keep on insisting, as I am now doing,
    upon what any ordinary person would think was patent to the meanest
    intelligence; but as a matter of plain fact the further you advance in
    the Order, and the more people you get to know, the more you find this
    attitude, sometimes absurd and sometimes abominable, getting up and
    kicking you in the face.</p>

    <p>This is one of the reasons why the older I grow and the more experience
    I have of human nature, the more am I convinced of the wisdom of the
    Chiefs of the A.'. A.'., where association with any other person except
    your immediate superior or the one of whom you are yourself in charge
    is discouraged in every possible way.</p>

    <p>There are of course exceptions.  It is necessary, though regrettably so,
    for personal instruction in the practices to be given or received.&nbsp;
    For all that, I wish I could show you 200 or 300 letters that I have
    received in the last twenty years or so: they tell me without a shadow
    of doubt that anything like fraternization leads only to mischief.&nbsp; 
    When you wish instruction from your superior, it should be for definite 
    points and nothing else.&nbsp; Any breach of this convention is almost 
    certain to lead to one kind of trouble or another.&nbsp; It may in fact 
    be regarded as a defect of concentration if communication between any two 
    members of the Order should take place, except in cases of necessity.</p>

    <p>I know that it must seem hard to the weaker brethren of the Order that
    we should make so little appearance of success in the Great Work to which
    we are all pledged.&nbsp; It is so universal a convention that success should
    be measured by members.&nbsp; People like to feel that they have hundreds of
    Lodges from whom they can obtain assistance in moments of discouragement.</p>

    <p>But a far truer and deeper satisfaction is found when the student has
    contentedly gone on with his work all by his own efforts.&nbsp; Surely you
    have had sufficient example in these letters, where in moments of despair 
    one suddenly awakes to the fact the despite all appearances one has been 
    watched and guarded from a higher plane.&nbsp; I might say, in fact,
    that one such experience of the secret guardianship of the Chiefs of the
    Order is worth a thousand apparently sufficient witnesses to the facts.</p>

    <p>I would have you lay this closely to your heart, dear Sister, and moreover 
    always to keep in mind what I have written in this letter so that
    you may be able to recognise when the occasion arises how much better
    evidence of the power and intelligence of the Order is this to being
    constantly cheered up along the difficult way by incidents such as it
    is possible to explain by what might be considered normal circumstances.</p>

    <p>Finally, let me insist that it is a definite symptom of Magical ill-health 
    when the craving for manifestation of that power and intelligence
    come between the worker and his work.</p>
