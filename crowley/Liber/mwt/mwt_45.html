    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLV: &quot;Unserious&quot; Conduct of a Pupil</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Here pops us Zola again&mdash;this time he says <em>J'Accuse</em>!&nbsp; Today's 
    Hexagram for me is No. X. L&icirc;, the Tiger: and the Duke of Chau comments on
    the last line as follows:&nbsp; &quot;The sixth line, undivided, tells us to
    look at the whole course that is trodden, and examine the presage which
    that gives.&nbsp; If it be complete and without failure, there will be great
    good fortune.&quot;&nbsp; O.K.; Let's!</p>

    <p>It is now well over a year since you came to me howling like a damned
    soul in torment&mdash;and so you should be!&mdash;and persuaded me to take you
    as my pupil.&nbsp; What have you done with that year?</p>

    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>

    <p>First, suppose we put down what you agreed to do: The essential preliminaries 
    of the work of the A.'. A.'.&mdash;you are to be heartily congratulated upon 
    your swift perception that the principles of that august body were absolute.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>1.&nbsp; Prepare and submit your Magical Record.&nbsp; (Without this you are
      in the position of a navigator with neither chart nor log.)
      It would have been quite easy to get this ready in a week.&nbsp; Have
      you done so in a year?&nbsp; No.</p>
      <p>2.&nbsp; Learn to construct and perfect the Body of Light.&nbsp; This might
      have required anything up to a dozen personal lessons.&nbsp; You were
      urged to claim priority upon my time.&nbsp; What did you do?</p>
      <p>You made one experiment with me fairly satisfactory, and got full
      instructions for practice and experiment at home.</p>
      <p>You made one experiment, ignoring every single one of the recommendations made to you.</p>
      <p>You kept on making further appointments for a second personal
      lesson; and every one of them you broke.</p>
      <p>3.  Begin simple Yoga practices.</p>
      <p>This, of course, cannot be checked at all in the absence of a
      careful record and of instructed critical analysis.&nbsp; You do not
      make the one, and are incapable of the other.&nbsp;
      So I suppose you are very well satisfied with yourself!</p>
      <p>4.&nbsp;  Your O.T.O. work.</p>
      <p>You were supplied with copies of those rituals to which you were entitled.</p>
      <p>You were to make copies of these.</p>
      <p>Your were to go through them with me, so as to assimilate their Symbolism and teaching.</p>
      <p>Have you done any of this?&nbsp; No.</p>
      <p>5.&nbsp; You were to write me a letter of questions once every fortnight.</p>
      <p>Have you done so?  No.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>
    <p>Have you in thirteen months done as much as honest work would have
    accomplished in a week?&nbsp; No.</p>
    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>

    <p>What excuses do you drag out, when taxed with these misdemeanors?</p>

    <p>You are eager to make appointments to be received in audience; then you
    break them without warning, explanation, apology or regret.</p>

    <p>You are always going to have ample time to devote to the Great Work;
    but that time is always somewhere after the middle of next week.</p>

    <p>If you put half as much enthusiasm into what you quite rightly claim to
    be the most important factor in life as other old ladies do into Culbertson 
    Contract, you might get somewhere.</p>

    <p>What you need, in the way of a Guru, is some fat, greasy Swami, who
    would not allow you to enter or leave his presence without permission,
    or address him without being formally invited to do so.  After seven
    years at menial household drudgeries, you might with luck be allowed to
    listen to some of his improving discourse.</p>

    <p>Pretentious humbug is the only appeal to which you can be relied on to
    respond.&nbsp; Praxiteles would repel you, unless you covered the marble
    completely with glittering gew-gaws, tinsel finery, sham jewels from
    the tray of Autolycus!&nbsp; Yet it was precisely because you were sick of
    all this that you came to me at all.</p>

    <p>How can one take you as a serious student?  Only because you do have
    moments when the scales fall from your eyes, and your deep need tears
    down the tawdry counterfeits which hide the shrine where Isis stands
    unveiled&mdash;but ah! too far.&nbsp; You must advance.</p>

    <p>To advance&mdash;that means Work.&nbsp; Patient, exhausting, thankless, often
    bewildering Work.&nbsp; Dear sister, if you would but Work!&nbsp; Work blindly,
    foolishly, misguidedly, it doesn't matter in the end:&nbsp; Work in itself
    has absolute virtue.</p>

    <p>But for you, having got so far in this incarnation, there must be a
    revolution.&nbsp; You must no longer hesitate, no longer plan; you must
    leap into the dark, and leap at once.</p>

    <p>&quot;The Voice of my Higher Soul said unto me: Let me enter the Path of
    Darkness; peradventure thus I may attain the Light.&quot;<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Fraternally yours,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.  Let me adduce an example of the way in which the serious Aspirant
    bends to the oar.&nbsp; This is not boasting as if the facts denoted superlative 
    excellence; they speak.&nbsp; The only comment is that if such conduct
    is not normal and universal, it ought to be.&nbsp; Yet no!&nbsp; I would add this:
    that I have not yet heard of anyone who has attained to any results of
    importance who does not attribute his success to devotion of quite
    similar quality.</p>

    <p>Here they are:</p>

    <p>1.&nbsp; <em>The Cloud on the Sanctuary</em>.&nbsp; On reading this book, Mr. X.,<a href="#2">2</a> 
    who was desperate from the conviction that no success in life was worth a tinker's
    <em>dam</em>, decided: &quot;This is the answer to my problem; the members of the
    Secret Fraternity which this book describes have solved the riddle of
    life.&nbsp; I must discover them, and seek to be received amongst them.&quot;</p>

    <p>2.&nbsp; X., hearing a conversation in a caf&eacute; which made him think that the
    speaker<a href="#3">3</a> might be such an one as he sought, hunted him down&mdash;he 
    had gone on his travels&mdash;caught him, and made him promise an interview at the
    earliest possible date.</p>

    <p>3.&nbsp; This interview leading to an introduction to the Fraternity, he
    joined it, pledging his fealty.&nbsp; But he was grievously shocked, and
    nearly withdrew, when assured:&nbsp; &quot;There is nothing in this Oath which
    might conflict in any way with your civil, moral or religious obligations.&quot;&nbsp; 
    If it was <em>not</em> worth while becoming a murderer, a traitor, and an eternally 
    damned soul, why bother about it?&nbsp; was his attitude.</p>

    <p>The Head of the Fraternity<a href="#4">4</a> being threatened with revolt, X. when to 
    him, in circumstances which jeopardised his own progress, and offered his
    support &quot;to the last drop of my blood, and the last penny of my purse.&quot;</p>

    <p>Deciding to perform a critical Magical Operation,<a href="#5">5</a> and being warned 
    that serious opposition might come from his own friends, family, etc., he
    abandoned his career, changed his name, cut himself off completely from
    the past, and allowed no alien interest of any sort to interfere with
    his absorption in the Work.&nbsp; His journey to see the Head seemed at that
    time a fatal interruption; at the least, it involved the waste of one
    whole year.&nbsp; He was wrong; his gesture of setting the interests of the
    Order before his personal advancement was counted unto him for righteousness.</p>

    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>

    <p>There should be no need to extend this list; it could be continued
    indefinitely.&nbsp; X. had one rule of life, and one only; to do whatever
    came first on the list of agenda, and never to count the cost.</p>

    <p>Because this course of conduct was so rigidly rational, it appeared to
    others irrational and incalculable; because it was so serenely simple,
    it appeared an insoluble mystery of a complexity utterly unfathomable!</p>

    <p>But&mdash;I fear that you are only too likely to ask&mdash;is not this system
    (<em>a</em>) absurd, (<em>b</em>) wrong, as certain in the long run to defeat its own object.</p>

    <p>Well, as to (<em>a</em>), everything is absurd.&nbsp; The Universe is not constructed
    to gratify the mania of "social planners" and their tedipus kind.&nbsp; As
    to (<em>b</em>), there you said something; the refutation will lead us to open
    a new chapter.&nbsp; Ought not X. to have laid down a comprehensive scheme,
    and worked out the details, so that he would not break down half-way
    through for lack of foresight and provision for emergencies?</p>

    <p>An example.&nbsp; Suppose that the next step in his Work involved the sacrifice 
    of a camel in a house in Tooting Bec, furnished in such fashion as his Grimoire 
    laid down, and that the purchase of the house left him without resources to buy 
    that furniture, to say nothing of the camel.&nbsp; What a fool!</p>

    <p>No, that does not necessarily follow.&nbsp; If the Gods will the End, They
    also will the means.&nbsp; I shall do all that is possible to me by buying
    the house: I shall leave it to Them to do Their share when the time comes.</p>

    <p>This &quot;Act of Truth&quot; is already a Magical Formula of infallible puissance;
    the man who is capable of so thinking and acting is far more likely to
    get what he wanted from the Sacrifice&mdash;when at long last the Camel
    appears on the premises&mdash;then he who, having ample means to carry out
    the whole Operation without risk of failure, goes through the ceremony
    without ever having experienced a moment's anxiety about his ability to
    bring it to a successful conclusion.</p>

    <p>It think personally that the error lies in <em>calculating</em>.&nbsp; The injunction
    is &quot;to buy the egg of a perfectly black hen without haggling.&quot;&nbsp; You have
    no means of judging what is written in Their ledger; so &quot;...reason is a
    lie; ... &amp; all their words are skew-wise....&quot; AL II, 32</a>.</p>

    <p>Let me add that it is a well-attested fact of magical experience&mdash;beginning 
    with Tarquin and the Sibylline books!&mdash;as well as a fact of profane 
    psychology, that if you funk a fence, it is harder next time.&nbsp;
    If the boy falls off the pony, put him on again at once: if the young
    airman crashes, send him up again without a minute's avoidable delay.&nbsp;
    If you don't, their nerve is liable to break for good and all.</p>

    <p>I am not saying that this policy is invariably successful; your judgment 
    may have misled you as to the necessity of the Operation which
    loomed so large at the moment.&nbsp; And so on; plenty of room for blunders!</p>

    <p>But it is a thousand times better to make every kind of mistake than
    to slide into the habit of hesitation, of uncertainty, of indecision.</p>

    <p>For one thing, you acquire also the habit of dishonourable failure;
    and you very soon convince yourself that &quot;the whole thing is nonsense.&quot;
    confidence comes from exercise, from taking risks, from picking your-
    self up after a purler; finding that the maddest gambles keep oncoming
    off, you begin to suspect that there is no more than Luck in it; you
    observe this closely, and there forms, in the dusk dimly, a Shape; very
    soon you see a Hand, and from its movements you divine a Brain behind
    the whole contrivance.</p>

    <p>&quot;Good!&quot; you say quietly, with a determined nod; &quot;I'm watched, I'm
    helped: I'll do my bit; the rest will come about without my worrying
    or meddling.&quot;</p>

    <p>And so it is.</p>

    <p>Good-night.</p>
