    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS</h2>
    <h3>By Aleister Crowley</h3>
    <h3>Foreword</h3>

    <p>In 1943 Aleister Crowley met a lady who, having heard of his wide
    knowledge and experience, asked his advice on occult, spiritual, and
    practical matters.</p>

    <p>This chance connection resulted in a stimulating exchange of letters.
    Crowley then asked others to put similar questions to him.  The result
    was this collection of over eighty letters which are now being issued
    over the title that he chose, &quot;MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS.&quot;</p>

    <p>Crowley did not keep copies of his early letters to the above-mentioned
    lady, so was unable to include them in the collection that he planned
    to publish.&nbsp; Fortunately they have been preserved and are now included
    in the introduction to this book.  Their original form has been retained
    with the opening and closing formulae which Crowley used in all his
    letters.</p>

    <p>Crowley at first intended to call the book &quot;ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING&quot;,
    and sent the following circular to his friends and disciples asking them
    to suggest subjects for inclusion.</p>

    <hr>
    <p align="center">ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Much gratified was the author of THE BOOK OF THOTH to have so
      many letters of appreciation, mostly from women, thanking him for
      not 'putting it in unintelligible language', for 'making it all
      so clear that even I with my limited intelligence can understand
      it, or think I do.'</p>

      <p>&quot;Nevertheless and notwithstanding!&nbsp; For many years the Master
      Therion has felt acutely the need of some groundwork-teaching
      suited to those who have only just begun the study of Magick and
      its subsidiary sciences, or are merely curious about it, or
      interested in it with intent to study.&nbsp; Always he has done his
      utmost to make his meaning clear to the average intelligent educated 
      person, but even those who understand him perfectly and are
      most sympathetic to his work, agree that in this respect he has
      often failed.</p>

      <p>&quot;So much for the diagnosis&mdash;now for the remedy!</p>

      <p>&quot;One genius, inspired of the gods, suggested recently that the
      riddle might be solved somewhat on the old and well-tried lines
      of 'Dr. Brewer's Guide to Science'; <em>i.e.</em>, by having aspirants
      write to the Master asking questions, the kind of problem that
      naturally comes into the mind of any sensible enquirer, and getting
      his answer in the form of a letter.&nbsp; 'What is it?'&nbsp; 'Why should I
      bother my head about it?'&nbsp; 'What are its principles?'&nbsp; 'What use
      is it?'&nbsp; 'How do I begin?', and the like.</p>

      <p>&quot;This plan has been put into action; the idea has been to cover
      the subjects from every possible angle.&nbsp; The style has been colloquial 
      and fluent; technical terms have either been carefully avoided or most 
      carefully explained; and the letter has not been admitted to the series until 
      the querent has expressed satisfaction.&nbsp; Some seventy letters, up to the 
      present have been written, but still there seem to be certain gaps in the 
      demonstration, like those white patches on the map of the World, which looked 
      so tempting fifty years ago.</p>

      <p>&quot;This memorandum is to ask for your collaboration and support.&nbsp; A
      list, indicating briefly the subject of each letter already written, is appended.&nbsp; 
      Should you think that any of those will help you in your own problems, a typed copy 
      will be sent to you at once&nbsp;...&nbsp; Should you want to know anything outside 
      the scope, send in your question (stated as fully and clearly as possible)&nbsp;...&nbsp; 
      The answer should reach you, bar accidents, in less than a month&nbsp;...&nbsp; It is
      proposed ultimately to issue the series in book form.&quot;</p>

    <p>This has now been done.</p>
