    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXXIX: Prophecy</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Now, now, now!&nbsp; I really had hoped that this at least you might have
    spared me.&nbsp; Still, I have to admit that your reason for asking me to
    go all pontifical about Prophecy is a good one; you want a chucker-out 
    for the loafers that come cadging into your Taverne de la Belle
    Sibylle, and waste your time with piffle about Pyramids.</p>

    <p>What a game!</p>

    <p>So naturally you need a Book of the Rules, and a list of the classes of
    offensive people, whether prostitutes, policemen, or verminous persons.&nbsp;
    (I quote from the Regulations for secular Pubs!) who think the easiest
    of all possible refuges from their Fear (see other letters!) is reliance
    upon the mouldy mumblings of moth-eater mountebanks.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it will be best to begin by setting down the necessary conditions
    for a genuine prophecy.  We shall find that most of the famous predictions 
    are excluded without need of more specific examination.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;priority, please, as usual, for the etymology.&nbsp; Prophesy means
    &quot;forth-speaking,&quot; more or less equal to &quot;inspired.&quot;&nbsp; 
    It has nothing to do with foretelling the future, though it may do so, as it may do 
    anything, being only the ravings of a poet, drunkard, or madman.&nbsp; (You remember 
    how Saul came upon a company of youths all prophesying away together to beat the 
    hand, and joined the merry throng.&nbsp; So people said, &quot;Is Saul also among 
    the Prophets?&quot; meaning a man capable of the &quot;divine&quot;
    intoxication of love, song, eloquence, or whatever else enthusiastic
    might possess him.&nbsp; Men seized by the afflatus were found to be capable
    of extraordinary exploits; hence the condition was admired and envied
    by the average clod.&nbsp; Also, imitated by the average crook!)</p>

    <p>For all that, I am going for once to yield to popular clamour, and use
    words in their popular sense.  That seems to me, roughly this: Prediction 
    is a forecast based on reason, prophecy one which claims the warrant of 
    &quot;magical&quot; powers.&nbsp; You agree?&nbsp; Then we can get on.</p>

    <p>1. <em>The prophecy must announce itself as such</em>.&nbsp; We cannot have people
    picking up odds and ends which may be perfectly irrelevant, and insisting that 
    they conceal forecasts. This excludes Great Pyramid lunatics; it would be quite 
    simple to do the same sham calculations with the Empire State Building; when the 
    architects protested, it is simple to reply: why, but of course!&nbsp; God was 
    most careful not to let them know what they were really doing, or they would 
    have died of fright!</p>

    <p>This argument was actually put forward by the Spiritists when Zancig confessed 
    that his music-hall exploits<a href="#ac1">*</a> were accomplished by means of a
    code.&nbsp; It is quite useless to get any sense whatever into the heads of
    these bigoted imbeciles.&nbsp; Here, A.C! don't forget your best-beloved
    Browning!&nbsp; In <em>Mr. Sludge the Medium</em>, the detected cheat&mdash;it was D.D.
    Home in real life&mdash;offers this silly subterfuge:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Why, when I cheat<br>
      Mean to cheat, do cheat, and am caught in the act,<br>
      Are you, or rather, am I sure o' the fact?<br>
      (There's verse again, but I'm inspired somehow)<br>
      Well then I'm not sure!&nbsp; I may be perhaps,<br>
      Free as a babe from cheating; how it began,<br>
      My gift,&mdash;no matter; what 'tis got to be<br>
      In the end now, that's the question; answer that!<br>
      Had I seen, perhaps, what hand was holding mine,<br>
      Leading me whither, I had died of fright<br>
      So, I was made believe I led myself.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>2. <em>The date of the prophecy must antecede that of its fulfilment</em>.
    The very greatest care must be taken to insure this.  When both dates
    are remote, as in the case of &quot;fulfilled&quot; Biblical prophecies, this is
    often impossible.</p>

    <p>3. <em>The prophecy must be precise</em>.&nbsp; This rules out cases where alternative 
    verifications are possible.</p>

    <p>4. <em>The prophecy must be more than a reasonable calculation of probability</em>.
    This rules out stuff like &quot;The Burden of Nineveh&quot;<a href="#1">1</a> and the like.&nbsp; 
    Incidentally, &quot;The Burden of Damascus&quot; does not seem to have had much luck 
    so far!&nbsp; By latest accounts, the old burg wasn't feeling too badly.</p>

    <p>We may also refer to the Second Advent: &quot;Behold!&nbsp; I come quickly.&quot;<a href="#2">2</a></p>

    <p>There have been quite a few false alarms to date.&nbsp; (It began with Jesus
    himself, snapping off the disciple's head: &quot;If I will that he tarry till I 
    come, what is that to thee?&quot;&nbsp; Well, <em>somebody</em> was disappointed.)</p>


    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> Mrs. Zancig sat on the stage, blindfolded.&nbsp; Her husband wandered 
    about the audience, taking one object or another from one or another of them,
    and asking her &quot;Ready?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is this?&quot;&nbsp; 
    &quot;And this?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;This now?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Right, what's 
    this?&quot; and so on.&nbsp; They had worked out a list of some hundreds of 
    questions to cover any probable article, or to spell its name, or give a number, 
    as when asked the number of a watch or 'bus ticket&mdash;and so on.&nbsp; One 
    evening at Cambridge, I was explaining this to a group of undergraduates; being 
    doubted, I offered to do the same trick with the help of one of them&mdash;a 
    complete stranger.&nbsp; I only stipulated to ten minutes alone with him &quot;to 
    hypnotize him.&quot;</p>

    <p>Of course I won easily.&nbsp; They cut out one possible way of communication
    after another; but I always managed to exchange a few words with my
    &quot;medium&quot; or slip him a note, so as to have a new code not excluded by
    the latest precaution.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>5. <em>The verification must be simple, natural, unique and unmistakable</em>.
    Forced and far-fetched explanations, distortions of Qabalistic or other
    mathematical reasoning, are barred.</p>

    <p>6. <em>The prophecy itself must possess the complement of this precision</em>.&nbsp;
    <br>It must be so perfectly unintelligible at the time that the elucidation of the 
    answer makes it certain that the prophet knew precisely the whole riddle.</p>

    <p>I feel that this condition is itself expressed in a somewhat oracular form; I 
    will try to clarify by citing what I consider a perfect example.&nbsp; Perfect, 
    I say, because the &quot;must&quot; is a little too strong; there are degrees 
    of excellence.</p>

    <p>&quot;That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well
    its name, &amp; it shall be to you as 718."  (AL III, 19)</p>

    <p>(The St&eacute;l&eacute; is that whose discovery culminated in the writing of 
    The Book of the Law</a>.)</p>

    <p>Here the first part is still quite unintelligible to me: I have tried analysis 
    of the original phrase in &quot;Scripture,&quot;<a href="#3">3</a> and nearly everything 
    else: entirely in vain: One can see dimly how people, recognizing that
    St&eacute;l&eacute; as the Talisman responsible for reducing half the cities of
    Europe to rubble, might very well make reference to those original
    prophecies.&nbsp; But, at the best, that's nothing to cable to Otaheite
    about!</p>

    <p>Now the second part.&nbsp; This was even more baffling than the other.&nbsp; &quot;Count
    well its name&quot;?&nbsp; how can I?  it never had a name!  So I tried all sorts of 
    experiments with 718.&nbsp; Shin, 300, the letter of Spirit, with our key-number 418, 
    looks promising.&nbsp; Only one more pie-crust!&nbsp; I kept attacking, off and on, 
    for many a long year, got out all sorts of fantastic solutions, complex and confused; 
    they simply shouted their derision at me.</p>

    <p>It was one glorious night in Cefal, too utterly superb to waste in sleep;
    I got up; I adored the Stars and the Moon; I revelled in the Universe.&nbsp;
    Yet there was something pulling at me.&nbsp; It pulled eftsoons my body into
    my chair, and I found myself at this old riddle of 718.&nbsp; Half-a dozen
    comic failures.&nbsp; But I felt that there was something on the way.&nbsp; Idly,
    I put down St&eacute;l&eacute; in the Greek, 52,<a href="#4">4</a> and said, 
    &quot;Perhaps we can make a 'name' out of the difference between that and 718.&quot;</p>

    <p>I jumped.</p>

    <p>718 - 52 = 666</p>

    <p>My own name!</p>

    <p>Why, of course, quoth he, in glee; it is in fact the St&eacute;l&eacute; of 666; for
    it is the St&eacute;l&eacute; of Ankh-f-n-khonsu, my name in those past days.</p>

    <p>Oh, no! said Something, that's not good enough!&nbsp; &quot;Count well its 
    <em>name</em>&quot;&mdash;the St&eacute;l&eacute; of Ankh-f-n-khonsu: a <em>name</em> is 
    something to which it answers, quite different from a title.&nbsp; That solution is 
    clever, but it just won't do, because that St&eacute;l&eacute; never had a name!</p>

    <p>You lie!&nbsp; I shouted, as the full light broke through the mists of my
    mind: In these three Thousand years it has once, if only once, had a <em>name</em>, 
    by invoking which you could bring it up before you; its <em>name</em> is
    &quot;St&eacute;l&eacute; 666&quot; in the Catalogue of the Museum at Boulak!</p>

    <p>A single simple hammerstroke, and the nail is driven home to the head!</p>

    <p>Compare this with the chaotic devices of the &quot;bilateral-cipher&quot; maniacs,
    by the application of which it is easy to prove that Bernard Shaw wrote
    Rudyard Kipling.&nbsp; Or anything else! you pay your money, and you take
    your choice.</p>

    <p>7. Another strong point is that the prophecy should on the surface
    mean something vague and plausible, and, interpreted, possess this same
    quality of unique accuracy.</p>

    <p>For instance (although it is not prediction) consider &quot;Love is the law,
    love under will.&quot;&nbsp; Yes, that sounds very well; I dare say that is an
    excellent point of philosophy.&mdash;But! well, anyone might say that.
    Oh, no!&nbsp; For when we use the Greek of the technical terms, we find
    &Alpha;&Gamma;&Alpha;&Pi;&Eta;, Love, and &Theta;&Epsilon;&Lambda;&Eta;&Mu;&Alpha, 
    Will, both of the value of 93&mdash;and these only two blossoms of the Tree whose 
    root is 31, and the entire numerical-verbal system based thereupon organized with 
    incredibly simple intricacy;  well, that is an Eohippus of an entirely different 
    tint!&nbsp; It is no more the chance (if happy) statement of any smooth-tongued 
    philosopher, but the evidence of, and the key to, an incalculably vast design.&nbsp;
    As well attribute the Riemann-Christoffel Tensor to the &quot;happy thought&quot;
    of some post-prandial mathematician.</p>

    <p>Here is another case.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Now then this two-in-One letter <img src="039_fig01.gif" width="25" height="25" alt="Moon symbol = old style capital Sigma" border="0"><img src="039_fig02.gif" width="24" height="25" alt="Sun symbol = capital Theta" border="0">, is the 
      third Key to this Law; and on the discovery of that fact, after years of constant seeking, what
      sudden splendours of Truth, sacred as secret, blazed in the midnight of my mind!&nbsp; 
      Observe now; &quot;...this circle squared in its failure is a key also.&quot;<a href="#5">5</a>&nbsp; 
      Now I knew that in the value of the letters ALHIM,<a href="#6">6</a> 'the Gods', the Jews had concealed 
      a not quite correct value of &pi;, the ratio of a circle's circumference to 
      its diameter, to 4 places of decimals: 3.1415; nearer would be 3.1416.&nbsp; If I prefix our Key, 
      31 putting 
      <img src="039_fig01.gif" width="25" height="25" border="0"><img src="039_fig02.gif" width="24" height="25" border="0"><img src="039_fig03.gif" width="35" height="25" alt="Sun and Moon conjoined" border="0">, Set or Satan, before 
      the old Gods, I get 3.141593, &pi; correct to six places, Six being my own number and that of 
      Horus the Sun.<a href="#7">7</a>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>And one more, this time an actual prediction.</p>

    <p>Here again is what might at first seem almost an evasion!&nbsp; &quot;...one commeth
    after him,...&quot; indeed!&nbsp; I suppose so.&nbsp; It fits anybody who discovers it or
    claims to have done so.</p>

    <p>Not one little bit!</p>

    <p>For when the time came, and the Key was found, the finder's name in the
    Order was&mdash;and had been from the moment of his admission as a 
    probationer&mdash;Achad, the Hebrew word for &quot;One.&quot;&nbsp; And 
    he came &quot;after him&quot; in the precise technical sense, that he was 
    in fact the next person to undertake the Adventure of the Abyss.</p>

    <p>I hope you are not getting the idea that my Prophetic ambit is limited
    to these high-falutin' metaphysical masterpieces of Runic Lore.&nbsp; In case
    you do, I now propose to break your &quot;seven green withs that were never
    dried&quot; altogether, Delilah; for I shall keep my hair on.&nbsp; I shall 
    go forth to war!&nbsp; From 1920 to 1923 my abode for a season was the house
    called the Horsel of the Abbey of Thelema that lieth upon Santa Barbara,
    overlooking the town of Telepylus&mdash;see Homer and Samuel Butler II, but
    called later by the Romans Cephaloedium, and now Cefal.&nbsp; There did I
    toil to expand my little Part III of <em>Book 4</em> to the portentous volume
    now more generally known as <em>Magick in Theory and Practice</em>.&nbsp; After 
    numerous misadventures, it was published in 1928.<a href="#8">8</a></p>

    <p>I refer you to that book, page 96.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>One last word on this subject.  There is a Magical Operation of
      maximum importance: the Initiation of a New Aeon.  When it becomes
      necessary to utter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed in
      blood.  Before man is ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great
      War must be fought.  This Bloody Sacrifice is the critical point of
      the World-Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowned and
      Conquering Child, as Lord of the Aeon.<a href="#ac2">*</a></p>

      <p>The whole matter is prophesied in <em>The Book of the Law</em> itself; let
      the student take note, and enter the ranks of the Host of the Sun.</p>

      <hr class="minor" />
      <p><b>*</b> Note: This paragraph was written in the summer 1911, e.v., just
      three years before its fulfilment.&nbsp; Second innings '38 e.v., sqq.<a href="#9">9</a></p>
      <hr class="minor" />
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>(It is a pity that I cannot prove my footnote, but this Chapter XII was
    part of the original MS, advertised as to be published in 1912.&nbsp; You may
    take my word for it, for once.&nbsp; And in any case we have the prophecy of
    Bartzabel, the Spirit of Mars, in the early summer of 1910 that wars
    involving the disaster of (a) Turkey and (b) Germany would be fought
    within 5 years.&nbsp;<a href="#10">10</a> See the <em>New York World</em>, December, 1914.)</p>

    <p>We now proceed to <em>Magick</em>, page 112.</p>

    <blockquote>
      But now observe how the question of the Magical Link arises!&nbsp; No
      matter how mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless
      it is applied to and by mankind.&nbsp; As long as <em>The Book of the Law</em>
      was in Manuscript, it could only affect the small group amongst
      whom it was circulated.&nbsp; It had to be put into action by the
      Magical Operation of publishing it.&nbsp; When this was done, it was
      done without proper perfection.&nbsp; Its commands as to how the work
      ought to be done were not wholly obeyed.&nbsp; There were doubt and
      repugnance in FRATER PERDURABO's mind, and they hampered His work.
      He was half-hearted.&nbsp; Yet, even so, the intrinsic power of the
      truth of the Law and the impact of the publication were sufficient
      to shake the world so that a critical war broke out, and the minds
      of men were moved in a mysterious manner.  The second blow was
      struck by the re-publication of the Book in September 1913, and
      this time the might of this Magick burst out and caused a catastrophe
      to civilization.&nbsp; At this hour, the MASTER THERION is concealed,
      collecting his forces for a final blow.&nbsp; When <em>The Book of the Law</em>
      and its Comment is published with the forces of His whole Will in
      perfect obedience to the instructions which have up to now been
      misunderstood or neglected, the result will be incalculably effective.&nbsp; 
      The event will establish the kingdom of the Crowned and Conquering Child 
      over the whole earth, and all men shall bow to the Law, which is &quot;love 
      under will.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>This should be plain enough, and satisfactory.&nbsp; However, I thought it
    was time to draw public attention to these matters more emphatically.</p>

    <p>In fulfillment of my pledge given above, and of the instructions originally 
    given to me by the Masters, I got out <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em> at
    6:22 a.m., Dec. 22. 1937, e.v.; and, to fulfill my condition No. 1 (above)
    of a Prophecy, as well as to establish the date, I got a reporter on the
    spot, with the result following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4 align="center">These Names Make News.</h4>
      <h5 align="center">Mixed Bag of Early Birds.</h5>

      <p>An Englishman, a Jew, an Indian, a Negro, a Malayan&mdash;no, it's not
      one of those saloon-bar jokes&mdash;assembled on the Embankment, by
      Cleopatra's Needle, soon after 6 a.m. yesterday.</p>

      <p>They were there to assist at the publication of a book by 62 year-
      old magician, ALEISTER CROWLEY.</p>

      <p>Publication occurred at 6:22 sharp, when the Sun entered Capricornus.</p>

      <p>Crowley make a short speech; as &quot;the Priest of the Princes&quot; proclaimed 
      the Law of Thelema; handed copies of book to white, red, brown, black, yellow 
      representatives.</p>

      <p>Representative of the &quot;black&quot; race was a dancing-girl.&nbsp; Indian was
      a non-English speaking Bengali Muslim, who seemed rather puzzled by the whole business.</p>

      <p>Book contains message dictated to Crowley at Cairo in 1904 &quot;by
      Aiwass, a Being whose nature he does not fully understand but who
      described Himself as 'The Minister of Hoor-Paar-Kraat' (the Lord
      of Silence).&quot;</p>

      <p>Prospectus of book says it's been published three times before;
      adds, sinisterly, that first publication was nine months before outbreak 
      of Balkan war, second, nine months before outbreak of world war, third, 
      nine months before outbreak of Sino-Japanese war.</p>

      <p>No coincidence, it says: &quot;the might of this Magick burst out and
      caused a catastrophe to civilisation.&quot;</p>

      <p>Well, we'll see next September . . . .</p>

      <p>&quot;It's a bit hard of you to wish another war on us,&quot; I said to Crowley.</p>

      <p>&quot;Oh, but if everyone will only do as I tell them to,&quot; he replied,
      &quot;the catastrophe can be averted.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Somehow I fear they won't.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center">. . . .</td><td align="center">. . . .</td></tr></table>

    <p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot;</p>

    <p>Then I issued a prospectus for the book, giving the facts as to previous
    publications and their results, and leaving blank a space after &quot;The
    Fourth Publication&quot; to wait the event.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4 align="center">THE FIRST PUBLICATION</h4>

      <p>nine months before the outbreak of the Balkan War, which broke up
      the Near East.</p>

      <p>When this was done it was done without proper perfection.&nbsp; 
      Its commands as to how the work ought to be done were not wholly
      obeyed . . .&nbsp; Yet, even so, the intrinsic power of the truth of
      the Law and the impact of publication were sufficient to shake the
      world, so that a critical war broke out, and the minds of men were
      moved in a mysterious manner.&quot;</p>

      <h4 align="center">THE SECOND PUBLICATION</h4>

      <p>nine months before the outbreak of the World War, which broke up the West.</p>

      <p>&quot;The second blow was struck by the re-publication of the Book in
      September, 1913, and this time . . . caused a catastrophe 
      to civilisation.&nbsp; At this hour, the Master Therion is concealed,
      collecting his forces for a final blow.&nbsp; When <em>The Book of the Law</em>
      and its Comment is published . . . in perfect obedience to the

      event will establish the Kingdom of the Crowned and Conquering
      Child over the whole earth, and all men shall bow to the Law,
      which is love under will.&quot;</p>

      <h4 align="center">THE THIRD PUBLICATION</h4>

      <p>nine months before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, which
      is breaking up the Far East.</p>

      <h4 align="center">THE FOURTH PUBLICATION</h4>

      <p>6:22 a.m., December 22, 1937, e.v.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This series of actions complies perfectly with the condition of Prophecy.</p>

    <p>Nine months elapsed, and I was able to overprint, also to reprint,
    enlarged to four pages my remaining prospectuses in red ink.&nbsp; As follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      nine months before the Betrayal, which stripped Britain of the last
      rags of honour, prestige and security, and will break up civilisation.
    </blockquote>
     
    <p>I have always maintained that Munich marked the true outbreak of the
    war, because Hitler's rape of Czecho-Slovakia, however justifiable, was
    irreconcilably incompatible with our Foreign Policy; and Munich is
    Nine Months to a day after my Gesture.</p>

    <p>This then I consider a completely documented case of Prophecy.</p>

    <p>And I shall be a completely documented case of Brain-Fag unless I shut up NOW.</p>

    <p id="3"><b>3</b>: See First Maccabees, I. 54, and the back-dated &quot;prophecies&quot; 
    of pseudo-Daniel (XI. 31, XII. 11); the reference was to the erection of a statue to Zeus-Serapis 
    in the Temple of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes following his conquest of Judea &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="4"><b>4</b>: This enumeration depents on reading ST as the obsolete letter <em>Stau</em> or 
    <em>Stigma</em> which has the value 6 &ndash; T.S.</p>

    <p id="6"><b>6</b>: Spelt in Hebrew letters in the original.</p>
    <p id="7"><b>7</b>: This Sun &amp; Moon symbolism flows from Crowley's work with Greek,
    Tarot and Hebrew.&nbsp; &quot;Set&quot; as Sigma-Theta or as Shin-Teth.&nbsp; Taking the 
    numbers for the corresponding Tarot Trumps from the Thoth Deck, we get XX + XI = 31.&nbsp; 
    See <em>O.T.O. Newsletter</em>, No. 7-8, p. 9 ff, &quot;Liber MCCLXIV The Greek Qabalah&quot; 
    and No. 9, p. 31 &ndash; WEH.<br>
    See also Liber V vel Reguli</a>.&nbsp; To clarify: the Greek letter Sigma 
    &Sigma; can also be written as C, which approximates the symbol for the moon; a capital Theta, &Theta;, 
    approximates the symbol for the Sun.&nbsp; Shin-Teth are the Hebrew equivalents.&nbsp; I am not quite 
    clear on how Crowley reads 3.141593 from ShT + ALHIM: reducing each letter to units gives the sequence 
    3, 9, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4 and there is no way one can get the required order from that with a constant 
    step.&nbsp; To get 3.1415 from ALHIM is not a simple reversal of the order but requires writing the 
    numbers around an Invoking Pentagram and reading them in the order of the corresponding Banishing 
    Pentagram.&nbsp; See <em>A Note on Genesis</em> &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="8"><b>8</b>: <em>sic.</em>, should be 1930 &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="9"><b>9</b>: The postscript was apparently hand-written by Crowley into one of his copies of 
    <em>Magick in Theory and Practice.</em></p>
