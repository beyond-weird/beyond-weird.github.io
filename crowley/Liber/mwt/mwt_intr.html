    <h4 align="center">LETTERS WRITTEN BY THE MASTER THERION TO A STUDENT</h4>
    <p class="subhead" id="A"><b>Letter No. A</b></p>

    <p align="right">March 19, 1943</p>
    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>I was very glad to gather from your conversation yesterday afternoon that
    you have a serious intention of taking up the Great Work in the proper
    spirit.&nbsp; Your criticisms of previous experience in the course of your adventures 
    appeared to be singularly sane and just.&nbsp; As I promised I am writing this 
    letter to cover a few practical points which we had not time to discuss and which 
    in any case I think it better to arrange by correspondence.</p>

    <p>1) It is of the first importance that you should understand my personal
    position.&nbsp; It is not actually wrong to regard me as a teacher, but it
    is certainly liable to mislead; fellow-student, or, if you like, fellow-sufferer, 
    seems a more appropriate definition.</p>

    <p>The climax of my life was what is known as the Cairo Working, described in
    the minutest detail in <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em>.&nbsp; At that time most 
    of The Book of the Law</a> was completely unintelligible 
    to me, and a good deal of it&mdash;especially the third chapter&mdash;extremely 
    antipathetic.&nbsp; I fought against this book for years; but it proved irresistible.</p>

    <p>I do not think I am boasting unfairly when I say that my personal researches
    have been of the greatest value and importance to the study of the subject
    of Magick and Mysticism in general, especially my integration of the various 
    thought-systems of the world, notably the identification of the system
    of the <em>Yi King</em> with that of the Qabalah.&nbsp; But I do assure you that the 
    whole of my life's work, were it multiplied a thousand fold, would not be worth
    one tithe of the value of a single verse of <em>The Book of the Law</em>.</p>

    <p>I think you should have a copy of <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em> and make <em>The
    Book of the Law</em> your constant study.&nbsp; Such value as my own work may possess
    for you should amount to no more than an aid to the interpretation of this
    book.</p>

    <p>2) It may be that later on you will want a copy of <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em>
    so I am putting a copy aside for you in case you should want it.</p>

    <p>3) With regard to the O.T.O., I believe I can find you a typescript of
    all the official documents.&nbsp; If so, I will let you have them to read,
    and you can make up your mind as to whether you wish to affiliate to the
    Third Degree of the Order.&nbsp; I should consequently, in the case of your 
    deciding to affiliate, go with you though the script of the Rituals and explain 
    the meaning of the whole thing; communicating, in addition, the real secret 
    and significant knowledge of which ordinary Masonry is not possessed.</p>

    <p>4) The horoscope; I do not like doing these at all, but it is part of the
    agreement with the Grand Treasurer of the O.T.O. that I should undertake them 
    in worthy cases, if pressed.&nbsp; But I prefer to keep the figure to
    myself for future reference, in case any significant event makes consultation 
    desirable.</p>

    <p>Now there is one really important matter.  The only thing besides <em>The Book
    of the Law</em> which is in the forefront of the battle.&nbsp; As I told you yesterday, 
    the first essential is the dedication of all that one is and all that one has to 
    the Great Work, without reservation of any sort.&nbsp; This must be kept constantly 
    in mind; the way to do this is to practice Liber Resh vel
    Helios, sub figura CC,</a> pp. 425-426 - <em>Magick</em>.&nbsp; There is another version
    of these Adorations, slightly fuller; but those in the text are quite alright.&nbsp; 
    The important thing is not to forget.&nbsp; I shall have to teach you the signs and 
    gestures which go with the words.</p>

    <p>It is also desirable before beginning a formal meal to go through the following 
    dialogue: Knock 3-5-3: say, &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot;&nbsp; 
    The person at the other end of the table replies: &quot;What is thy Will?&quot;&nbsp; You: 
    &quot;It is my Will to eat and drink.&quot;&nbsp; He: &quot;To what end?&quot;&nbsp;
    You: &quot;That my body may be fortified thereby.&quot;&nbsp; He: &quot;To what end?&quot;&nbsp; 
    You: &quot;That I may accomplish the Great Work.&quot;&nbsp; He: &quot;Love is the law, love under
    will.&quot;&nbsp; You, with a single knock: &quot;Fall to.&quot;&nbsp; When alone make a monologue
    of it: thus, Knock 3-5-3.&nbsp; Do what, etc.&nbsp; It is my Will to, etc., that my
    body, <em>etc</em>., that I may, <em>etc</em>., Love is, <em>etc</em>.&nbsp; Knock: and begin to eat.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of performing these small
    ceremonies regularly, and being as nearly accurate as possible with regard
    to the times.&nbsp; You must not mind stopping in the middle of a crowded 
    thoroughfare&mdash;lorries or no lorries&mdash;and saying the Adorations; 
    and you must not mind snubbing your guest&mdash;or your host&mdash;if he or 
    she should prove ignorant of his or her share of the dialogue.&nbsp; It is 
    perhaps because these matters are so petty and trivial in appearance that 
    they afford so excellent a training.&nbsp; They teach you concentration, 
    mindfulness, moral and social courage, and a host of other virtues.</p>

    <p>Like a perfect lady, I have kept the tit bit to the last.&nbsp; It is absolutely
    essential to begin a magical diary, and keep it up daily.&nbsp; You begin by an
    account of your life, going back even before your birth to your ancestry.
    In conformity with the practice which you may perhaps choose to adopt later,
    given in Liber Thisarb, sub figura CMXIII</a>, paragraphs 27-28, <em>Magick</em>,
    pp. 420-422, you must find an answer to the question: &quot;How did I come to
    be in this place at this time, engaged in this particular work?&quot;&nbsp; As you
    will see from the book, this will start you on the discovery of who you
    really are, and eventually lead you to your recovering the memory of previous 
    incarnations.</p>

    <p>As it is difficult for you to come to Town except at rare and irregular
    intervals, may I suggest a plan which has previously proved very useful,
    and that is a weekly letter.&nbsp; Eliphas L&eacute;vi did this with the Baron 
    Spedalieri, and the correspondence is one of the most interesting of his works.&nbsp; 
    You ask such questions as you wish to have answered, and I answer them to the
    best of my ability.&nbsp; I, of course, add spontaneous remarks which may be
    elicited by my observations on your progress and the perusal of your magical diary.&nbsp; 
    This, of course, should be written on one side of the paper only, so that the opposite 
    page is free for comments, and an arrangement should be made for it to be inspected at 
    regular intervals.</p>

    <p align="right">April 20, 1943</p>
    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>I was very glad to have your letter, and am very sorry to hear that you
    have been in affliction.&nbsp; About the delay, however, I think I ought to tell
    you that the original Rule of the Order of A.'. A.'. was that the introducer
    read over a short lection to the applicant, then left him alone for a quarter 
    of an hour, and on coming back received a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp; 
    If there was any hesitation about it the applicant was barred for life.</p>

    <p>The reason for the relaxation of the rule was that it was thought better
    to help people along in the early stages of the work, even if there was no
    hope of their turning out first-class.&nbsp; But I should like you to realize
    that sooner or later, whether in this incarnation or another, it is put up
    to you to show perfect courage in face of the completely unknown, and the
    power of rapid and irrevocable decision without without counting the cost.</p>

    <p>I think that it is altogether wrong to allow yourself to be worried by
    &quot;psychological, moral, and artistic problems.&quot;&nbsp; It is no good 
    your starting anything of any kind unless you can see clearly into the 
    simplicity of truth.&nbsp; All this humming and hawing about things is moral 
    poison.&nbsp; What is the use of being a woman if you have not got an intuition, 
    an instinct enabling you to distinguish between the genuine and the sham?</p>

    <p>Your state of mind suggests to me that you must have been, in the past,
    under the influence of people who were always talking about things, and
    never doing any real work.&nbsp; They kept on arguing all sorts of obscure 
    philosophical points; that is all very well, but when you have succeeded in
    analyzing your reactions you will understand that all this talk is just an
    excuse for not doing any serious work.</p>

    <p>I am confirmed in this judgment by your saying: &quot;I don't know if I want to
    enter into a great conflict.&nbsp; I need peace."&quot;&nbsp; Fortunately you save 
    yourself by adding: &quot;Real peace, that is living and not stagnant.&quot;&nbsp; 
    All life is conflict.&nbsp; Every breath that you draw represents a victory in the 
    struggle of the whole Universe.&nbsp; You can't have peace without perfect mastery of 
    circumstance; and I take it that this is what you mean by &quot;living, not stagnant.&quot;</p>

    <p>But it is of the first consequence  for you to summon up the resolution to
    stamp on this sea of swirling thoughts by an act of will; you must say:
    &quot;Peace be still.&quot;&nbsp; The moment you have understood these thoughts for what
    they are, tools of the enemy, invented by him with the idea of preventing
    you from undertaking the Great Work&mdash;the moment you dismiss all such considerations 
    firmly and decisively, and say: &quot;What must I do?&quot; and having
    discovered that, set to work to do it, allowing of no interruption, you will
    find that living peace which (as you seem to see) is a dynamic and not a
    static condition.&nbsp; (There is quite a lot about this point in 
    Little Essays Toward Truth</a>, and also in <em>The Vision and the Voice</em>.)</p>

    <p>Your postscript made me smile.&nbsp; It is not a very good advertisement for the
    kind of people with whom you have been associated in the past.&nbsp; My own position 
    is a very simple one.&nbsp; I obeyed the injunction to &quot;buy a perfectly black hen, 
    without haggling.&quot;&nbsp; I have spent over 100,000 pounds of my inherited money 
    on this work: and if I had a thousand times that amount today it would all go in the 
    same direction.&nbsp; It is only when one is built in this way, to stand entirely aloof 
    from all considerations of twopence halfpenny more or fourpence halfpenny less, that 
    one obtains perfect freedom on this Plane of Discs.</p>

    <p>All the serious Orders of the world, or nearly all, begin by insisting that
    the aspirant should take a vow of poverty; a Buddhist Bhikku, for example,
    can own only nine objects&mdash;his three robes, begging bowl, a fan, toothbrush, and 
    so on.&nbsp; The Hindu and Mohammedan Orders have similar regulations; and so do all 
    the important Orders of monkhood in Christianity.</p>

    <p>Our own Order is the only exception of importance; and the reason for this
    is that it is much more difficult to retain one's purity if one is living
    in the world than if one simply cuts oneself off from it.&nbsp; It is far easier
    to achieve technical attainments if one is unhampered by any such considerations.&nbsp;
    These regulations operate as restrictions to one's usefulness in helping the world.&nbsp; 
    There are terrible dangers, the worst dangers of all, associated with complete 
    retirement.&nbsp; In my own personal judgment, moreover, I think that our own ideal of 
    a natural life is much more wholesome.</p>

    <p>When you have found out a little about your past incarnations, you should
    be able to understand this very clearly and simply.</p>

    <p class="subhead" id="C"><b>Letter No. C</b></p>

    <p align="right">April 30, 1943</p>
    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>Thank you for your long letter of no date, but received two days ago.&nbsp; 
    I am very sorry you are still feeling exhausted.&nbsp; I am not too good myself, 
    for I find this weather very trying.&nbsp; I will answer your various points as 
    best I can.</p?

    <p>I am arranging to send you the official papers connected with the O.T.O., but
    the idea that you should meet other members first is quite impossible.&nbsp; Even
    after affiliation, you would not meet anyone unless it were necessary for
    you to work in cooperation with them.&nbsp; I am afraid you have still got the
    idea that the Great Work is a tea-party.&nbsp; Contact with other students only
    means that you criticize their hats, and then their morals; and I am not
    going to encourage this.&nbsp; Your work is not anybody else's; and undirected
    chatter is the worst poisonous element in human society.</p>

    <p>When you talk of the &quot;actual record&quot; of the &quot;Being called Jesus 
    Christ,&quot; I don't know what you mean.&nbsp; I am not aware of the existence of 
    any such record.&nbsp; I know a great many legends, mostly borrowed from previous 
    legends of a similar character.</p>

    <p>It would be better for you to get a copy of <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em> and
    study it.&nbsp; The Great Work is the uniting of opposites.&nbsp; It may mean the
    uniting of the soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of the
    female with the male, of the ego with the non-ego&mdash;or what not.</p>

    <p>By &quot;love under will&quot; one refers to the fact that the method in every case
    is love, by which is meant the uniting of opposites as above stated, such
    as hydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and so on.  Any reaction what-
    ever, any phenomenon, is a phenomenon of &quot;love&quot;, as you will understand
    when I come to explain to you the meaning of the word &quot;point-event&quot;.&nbsp; But
    love has to be &quot;under will,&quot; if it is to be properly directed.&nbsp; You must
    find your True Will, and make all your actions subservient to the one great
    purpose.</p>

    <p>Ra-Hoor is the Sun God; Tahuti is the Egyptian Mercury; Kephra is the Sun
    at midnight.</p>

    <p>About your problems; what I have to do is to try to teach you to think
    clearly.&nbsp; You will be immensely stimulated by having all the useless 
    trimmings stripped from your thinking apparatus.&nbsp; For instance, I don't 
    think you know the first principles of logic.&nbsp; You apparently take up a more 
    or less Christian attitude, but at the same time you like very much the idea
    of Karma.&nbsp; You cannot have both.</p>

    <p>The question about money does not arise.&nbsp; This old and very good rule (which
    I have always kept) was really pertinent to the time when there were actual
    secrets.&nbsp; But I have published openly all the secrets.&nbsp; All I can do is to
    train you in a perfectly exoteric way.&nbsp; My suggestion about the weekly
    letter was intended to exclude this question, as you would be getting full
    commercial value for anything paid.</p>

    <p>Your questions about the Spirit of the Sun, and so on, are to be answered
    by experience.&nbsp; Intellectual satisfaction is worthless.&nbsp; I have to bring
    you to a state of mind completely superior to the mechanism of the normal mind.</p>

    <p>A good deal of your letter is rather difficult to answer.&nbsp; You always seem
    to want to put the cart before the horse.&nbsp; Don't you see that, if I were
    trying to get you to do something or other, I should simply return you to
    the kind of answer which I thought would satisfy you, and make you happy?
    And this would be very easy to do because you have got no clear ideas about 
    anything.&nbsp; For one thing, you keep on using terms about whose significance 
    we are not yet in agreement.&nbsp; When you talk about the &quot;Christian path,&quot; 
    do you believe in vicarious atonement and eternal damnation&mdash;or don't you?&nbsp; 
    A great deal of the confusion that arises in all these questions, and grows constantly 
    worse as fellow-students talk them over&mdash;the blind leading the blind&mdash;is 
    because they have no idea of the necessity of defining their terms.</p>

    <p>Then again, you ask me questions like &quot;What is purity?&quot; that can be answered 
    in a dozen different ways; and you must understand what is meant by a &quot;universe of 
    discourse.&quot;&nbsp; If you asked me&mdash;&quot;Is this sample of cloride of gold a 
    pure sample?&quot;&nbsp; I can answer you.&nbsp; You must understand the value of 
    precision in speech.&nbsp; I could go on rambling about purity and selflessness for 
    years, and no one would be a penny the better.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;or rather, I did not want to dictate this bit&mdash;Your ideas about
    the O.T.O. remind me of some women's idea of shopping.&nbsp; You want to maul about 
    the stock and then walk out with a proud glad smile: NO.&nbsp; Do you really think 
    that I should muster all the most distinguished people alive for your inspection and 
    approval?</p>

    <p>The affiliation clause in our Constitution is a privilege: a courtesy to
    a sympathetic body.&nbsp; Were you not a Mason, or Co-Mason, you would have to
    be proposed and seconded, and then examined by savage Inquisitors; and
    then&mdash;probably&mdash;thrown out on to the garbage heap.&nbsp; Well, no, it's 
    not as bad as that; but we certainly don't want anybody who chooses to apply.&nbsp;
    Would you do it yourself, if you were on the Committee of a Club?&nbsp; The O.T.O. 
    is a serious body, engaged on a work of Cosmic scope.&nbsp; You should question 
    yourself: what can I contribute?</p>

    <p>Secrets.  There is one exception to what I have said about publishing everything:
    that is, the ultimate secret of the O.T.O.&nbsp; This is really too dangerous to 
    disclose; but the safeguard is that you could not use it if you knew it, unless you 
    were an advanced Adept; and you would not be allowed to go so far unless we were 
    satisfied that you were sincerely devoted to the Great Work.&nbsp; (See <em>One Star 
    in Sight</em>).&nbsp; True, the Black Brothers could use it; but they would only destroy 
    themselves.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>

    <p class="subhead" id="D"><b>Letter No. D</b></p>

    <p align="right">June 8, 1943</p>
    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter.&nbsp; I couldn't find the O.T.O. typescript&mdash;and then
    it struck me that it would be useful to await your reactions.&nbsp; If I were expecting 
    some presumably important papers by post, I should get anxious after 24 hours delay (at 
    most) and start enquiries.&nbsp; Anyhow, I can't find them for the moment; but Mr. Bryant 
    said he would lend you his <em>Blue Equinox</em>: pages 195-270 give what you require.</p>

    <p>But the real point of your affiliating is that it saves me from constantly
    being on my guard lest I should mention something which I am sworn not to
    reveal.  As in every serious society, members are pledged not to disclose
    what they may have learnt, whom they have met; it is so, even in Co-Masonry: 
    isn't it: But one may mention the names of members who have died.&nbsp; (See
    Liber LII</a>, par. 2.)&nbsp; Be happy then; the late 
    X... Y... was one of us.&nbsp; I hope that he and Rudolph Steiner will (between them) 
    satisfy your doubts.</p>

    <p>The A.'.A.'. is totally different.&nbsp; <em>One Star in Sight</em> tells you everything 
    that you need to know.&nbsp; (Perhaps some of these regulations are hard to grasp: 
    personally, I can never understand all this By-Law stuff.&nbsp; So you must ask me what, 
    and why, and so on.)</p>

    <p>There is really only one point for your judgment.&nbsp; &quot;By their fruits ye
    shall know them.&quot;&nbsp; You have read <em>Liber LXV</em> and <em>Liber VII</em>; 
    That shows you what states you can attain by this cirriculum.&nbsp; Now read &quot;A 
    Master of the Temple&quot; (<em>Blue Equinox</em>, pp. 127-170) for an account of the 
    early stages of training, and their results.&nbsp; (Of course, your path might not 
    coincide with, or even resemble, his path.)</p>

    <p>But do get it into you head that &quot;If the blind lead the blind, they shall
    both fall into the ditch.&quot;&nbsp; If you had seen 1% of the mischief that I
    have seen, you would freeze to the marrow of your bones at the mere idea
    of seeing another member through the telescope!&nbsp; Well, I employ the figure
    of hyperbole, that I admit; but it really won't do to have a dozen cooks at the 
    broth!&nbsp; If you're working with me, you'll have no time to waste on other people.</p>

    <p>I fear your &quot;Christianity&quot; is like that of most other folk.&nbsp; You pick out
    one or two of the figures from which the Alexandrines concocted &quot;Jesus&quot; (too many 
    cooks, again, with a vengeance!) and neglect the others.&nbsp; The Zionist Christ of Matthew 
    can have no value for you; nor can the Asiatic &quot;Dying-God&quot;&mdash;compiled from 
    Melcarth, Mithras, Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Attis, Krishna, and others&mdash;who supplied 
    the miraculous and ritualistic elements of the fable.</p>

    <p>Rightly you ask: &quot;What can I contribute?&quot;&nbsp; Answer: One Book.&nbsp; That is the
    idea of the weekly letter: 52 of yours and 52 of mine, competently edited, would make a most 
    useful volume.&nbsp; This would be your property: so that you get full material value, perhaps 
    much more, for your outlay.&nbsp; I thought of the plan because one such arrangement has 
    recently come to an end, with amazingly happy results: they should lie open to your admiring 
    gaze in a few months from now.&nbsp; Incidentally, I personally get nothing out of it; secretarial 
    work costs money these days.&nbsp; But there is another great advantage; it keeps both of us up to 
    the mark.&nbsp; Also, in such letters a great deal of odds and ends of knowledge turn up 
    automatically; valuable stuff, frequent enough; yes, but one doesn't want to lose the thread, 
    once one starts.&nbsp; Possibly ten days might be best.</p>

    <p>But please understand that this suggestion arose solely from your own statement of what you 
    thought would help in your present circumstances.&nbsp; Anyway, as you say, decide!&nbsp; If it 
    is yes, I should like to see you before June 15 when I expect to go away for a few days; better 
    to give you some groundwork to keep you busy in my absence.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>Much thought has gone into the construction of your Motto.&nbsp; &quot;I will become&quot;
    can be turned neatly enough as &quot;Let there be;&quot; by avoiding the First Pronoun one 
    gets the idea of &quot;the absorption of the Self in the Beloved,&quot; which is exactly what 
    you want.</p>

    <p>&quot;The creative Force of the Universe&quot; is quite ready-made.&nbsp; 
    &Pi;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;, a pyramid, is that Force in its 
    geometrical form; in its biological form it is &Phi;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, 
    the Yang or Lingam.&nbsp; Both words have the same numerical value, 831.&nbsp; These two words 
    can therefore serve you as the secret object of your Work.&nbsp; How than can you construct 
    the number 831?</p>

    <p>The Letter Kaph, Jupiter (Jehovah), the Wheel of  Fortune in the Tarot&mdash;the Atu X is 
    a picture of the Universe built up and revolving by virtue of those Three Principles: Sulphur, 
    Mercury, Salt; or Gunas: Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas&mdash;has the value 20.&nbsp; So also has the 
    letter Yod spelt in full.<!-- i.e. Yod-Vau-Daleth -->

    <p>One Gnostic secret way of spelling and pronouncing Jehovah is &Iota;&Alpha;&Omega; and
    this has the value 811.&nbsp; So has &quot;Let there be,&quot; Fiat, transliterating into
    Greek.<!-- insert note re this: Phi Iota Alpha Tau --></p>

    <p>Resuming all these ideas, it seems that you can express your aspiration
    very neatly, very fully, by choosing for your motto the words FIAT YOD.</p>

    <p align="right">Aug. 20, 1943</p>
    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>Let me begin by referring to my letter about the motto and make clear to
    you the working of this letter.</p>

    <p>In this motto you have really got several ideas combined, and yet they are
    really, of course, one idea.&nbsp; Fiat, being 811, is identical with IAO, and
    therefore FIAT YOD might be read not only as &quot;let there be&quot; (or &quot;Let me
    become&quot;), the secret source of all creative energy, but as &quot;the secret
    source of the energy of Jehovah.&quot;&nbsp; The two words together, having the value
    of 831, they contain the secret meanings Pyramis and Phallos, which is the
    same idea in different forms; thus you have three ways of expressing the
    creative form, in its geometrical aspect, its human aspect, and its divine
    aspect.&nbsp; I am making a point of this, because the working out of this motto
    should give you a very clear idea of the sort of way in which Qabalah should
    be used.&nbsp; I think it is rather useful to remember what the essence of the
    Qabalah is in principle; thus, in your correspondence for Malkuth, Yesod,
    and Hod you are simply writing down some of the ideas which pertain to the
    numbers 10, 9, and 8 respectively.&nbsp; Naturally, there is a great deal of 
    redundancy and overloading as soon as you get to ideas important enough to
    be comprehensive; as is mentioned in the article on the 
    Qabalah</a> in <em>Equinox</em> Vol. I, No. 5, it is quite easy to prove 1 = 2 = 3 = 4, 
    <em>etc</em>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, you must be careful to avoid taking the correspondences
    given in the books of reference without thinking out <em>why</em> they are so given.
    Thus, you find a camel in the number which refers to the Moon, but the Tarot
    card &quot;the Moon&quot; refers not to the letter Gimel which means camel, but to
    the letter Qoph, and the sign Pisces which means fish, while the letter
    itself refers to the back of the head; and you also find fish has the
    meaning of the letter Nun.&nbsp; You must not go on from this, and say that the
    back of your head is like a camel&mdash;the connection between them is simply
    that they all refer to the same thing.</p>

    <p>In studying the Qabalah you mention six months; I think after that time
    you should be able to realize that, after six incarnations of uninterrupted
    study, you may realize that you can never know it; as Confucius said about
    the <em>Yi King</em>.&nbsp; &quot;If a few more years were added to my life, I would 
    devote a hundred of them to the study of the <em>Yi</em>.&quot;</p>

    <p>If, however, you work at the Qabalah in the same way as I did myself, in
    season and out of season, you ought to get a very fair grasp of it in six
    months.&nbsp; I will now tell you what this method is: as I walked about, I
    made a point of attributing everything I saw to its appropriate idea.  I
    would walk out of the door of my house and reflect that door is Daleth,
    and house Beth; now the word &quot;dob&quot; is Hebrew for bear, and has the number
    6, which refers to the Sun.&nbsp; Then you come to the fence of your property
    and that is Cheth&mdash;number 8, number of Tarot Trump 7, which is the Chariot:
    so you begin to look about for your car.&nbsp; Then you come to the street and
    the first house you see is number 86, and that is Elohim, and it is built
    of red brick which reminds you of Mars and the Blasted Tower, and so on.&nbsp;
    As soon as this sort of work, which can be done in a quite lighthearted
    spirit, becomes habitual, you will find your mind running naturally in
    this direction, and will be surprised at your progress.&nbsp; Never let your
    mind wander from the fact that your Qabalah is not my Qabalah; a good
    many of the things which I have noted may be useful to you, but you must
    construct your own system so that it is a living weapon in your hand.</p>

    <p>I think I am fair if I say that the first step on the Qabalah which may be
    called success, is when you make an actual discovery which throws light on
    some problem which has been troubling you.&nbsp; A quarter of a century ago I
    was in New Orleans, and was very puzzled about my immediate course of action;
    in fact I may say I was very much distressed.&nbsp; There seemed literally 
    nothing that I could do, so I bethought myself that I had better invoke
    Mercury.&nbsp; As soon as I got into the appropriate frame of mind, it naturally
    occurred to me, with a sort of joy, &quot;But <em>I am</em> Mercury.&quot;&nbsp; I 
    put it into Latin&mdash;<em>Mercurius sum</em>, and suddenly something struck me, 
    a sort of nameless reaction which said: &quot;That's not quite right.&quot;&nbsp; 
    Like a flash it came to me to put it into Greek, which gave me &quot;'&Epsilon;&rho;&mu;&eta;&sigmaf;
    &Epsilon;&iota;&mu;&iota;&quot; and adding that up rapidly, I got the number 418, 
    with all the marvellous correspondences which had been so abundantly useful to me 
    in the past (See <em>Equ. of the Gods</em>, p. 138).&nbsp; My troubles disappeared 
    like a flash of lightning.</p>

    <p>Now to answer your questions seriatum; it is quite all right to put questions 
    to me about <em>The Book of the Law</em>; a very extended commentary has been written, 
    but it is not yet published.&nbsp; I shall probably be able to answer any of your 
    questions from the manuscript, but you cannot go on after that when it would become 
    a discussion; as they say in the law-courts, &quot;You must take the witness' answer.&quot;</p>

    <p>II. The Qabalah, both Greek and Hebrew, also very likely Arabic, was used
    by the author of <em>The Book of the Law</em>.&nbsp; I have explained above the proper
    use of the Qabalah.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how the early Rosicrucians used it,
    but I think one may assume that their methods were not dissimilar to our
    own.&nbsp; Incidentally, it is not very safe to talk about Rosicrucians, because
    their name has become a signal for letting loose the most devastating floods
    of nonsense.&nbsp; What is really known about the original Rosicrucians is 
    practically confined to the three documents which they issued.&nbsp; The eighteenth
    century Rosicrucians<!-- the ref is probably to the German "Golden and Rosy Cross" --> 
    may, or may not, have been legitimate successors of the original brotherhood&mdash;I
    don't know.&nbsp; But from them the O.T.O. derived its authority; The late O.H.O. 
    Theodor Reuss possessed a certain number of documents which demonstrated the 
    validity of his claim according to him; but I only saw two or three of them, 
    and they were not of very great importance.&nbsp; Unfortunately he died shortly 
    after the last War, and he had got out of touch with some of the other Grand Masters.&nbsp;
    The documents did not come to me as they should have done; they were seized by his wife 
    who had an idea that she could sell them for a fantastic price; and we did not feel 
    inclined to meet her views.&nbsp; I don't think the matter is of very great importance, 
    the work being done by members of the Order all over the place is to me quite sufficient.</p>

    <p>III. The Ruach contains both the moral and intellectual worlds, which is
    really all that we mean by the conscious mind; perhaps it even includes
    certain portions of the subconscious.</p>

    <p>IV. In initiation from the grade of Neophyte to that of Zelator, one passes 
    by this way.&nbsp; The main work is to obtain admission to, and control
    of, the astral plane.</p>

    <p>Your expressions about &quot;purifying the feelings&quot; and so on are rather vague
    to enter into a scientific system like ours.&nbsp; The result which you doubtless refer 
    to is attained automatically in the course of your experiments.&nbsp; Your very soon 
    discover the sort of state of mind which is favourable or unfavourable to the work, 
    and you also discover what is helpful and harmful to these states in your way of 
    life.&nbsp; For instance, the practice like the non-receiving of gifts is all right for 
    a Hindu whose mind is branded for ten thousand incarnations by the shock of accepting a 
    cigarette or a cup of tea.&nbsp; Incidentally, most of the Eastern cults fall down when 
    they come West, simply because they make no allowance for our different temperaments.  
    Also they set tasks which are completely unsuitable to Europeans&mdash;an immense amount 
    of disappointment has been caused by failure to recognize these facts.</p>

    <p>Your sub-questions a, b, and c are really answered by the above.&nbsp; All the
    terms you use are very indefinite.  I hope it will not take too long to get you out 
    of the way of thinking in these terms.&nbsp; For instance, the word &quot;initiation&quot; 
    includes the whole process, and how to distinguish between it and enlightenment I cannot 
    tell you.&nbsp; &quot;Probation,&quot; moreover, if it means &quot;proving,&quot; continues 
    throughout the entire process.&nbsp; Nothing is worse for the student than to indulge in 
    these wild speculations about ambiguous terms.</p>

    <p>V. You can, if you like, try to work out a progress of Osiris through Amennti on 
    the Tree of Life, but I doubt whether you will get any satisfactory result.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that you should confine yourself very closely to the actual
    work in front of you.  At the present moment, of course, this includes a
    good deal of general study; but my point is that the terms employed in
    that study should always be capable of precise definition.  I am not sure
    whether you have my Little Essays Toward Truth</a>.&nbsp; 
    The first essay in the book entitled &quot;Man&quot;</a>
    gives a full account of the five principles which go to make up Man according to the 
    Qabalistic system.&nbsp; I have tried to define these terms as accurately as possible, 
    and I think you will find them, in any case, clearer than those to which you have become 
    accustomed with the Eastern systems.&nbsp; In India, by the way, no attempt is ever made 
    to use these vague terms.&nbsp; They always have a very clear idea of what is meant by
    words like &quot;Buddhi,&quot; &quot;Manas&quot; and the like.&nbsp; Attempts at translation 
    are very unsatisfactory.&nbsp; I find that even with such a simple matter as the
    &quot;Eight limbs of Yoga,&quot; as you will see when you come to read my <em>Eight Lectures</em>.</p>

    <p>I am very pleased with your illustrations; that is excellent practice for you.&nbsp; 
    Presently you have to make talismans, and a Lamen for yourself, and even to devise a seal 
    to serve as what you might call a magical coat-of-arms, and all this sort of thing is very 
    helpful.</p>

    <p>It occurs to me that so far we have done nothing about the astral plane and this path of 
    Tau of which you speak.&nbsp; Have you had any experience of travelling in the astral?&nbsp; 
    If not, do you think that you can begin by yourself on the lines laid down in Liber O</a>, 
    sections 5</a> and 6?</a>&nbsp; 
    (See <em>Magick</em>, pp. 387-9).&nbsp; If not you had better let me take you through the first 
    gates.&nbsp; The question of noise instantly arises; I think we should have to do it not 
    earlier than nine o'clock at night, and I don't know whether you can manage this.</p>

    <p><em>777</em> is practically unpurchaseable: copies fetch &pound;10 or so.&nbsp; Nearly all

    sent at once.&nbsp; &quot;Working out games with numbers.&quot;&nbsp; I am sorry you should 
    see no more than this.&nbsp; When you are better equipped, you will see that the Qabalah is 
    the best (and almost the only) means by which an intelligence can identify himself.&nbsp; 
    And Gematria methods serve to discover spiritual truths.&nbsp; Numbers are the network of 
    the structure of the Universe, and their relations the form of expression of our Understanding 
    of it.<a href="#G1">*</a>&nbsp; In Greek and Hebrew there is no other way of writing 
    numbers; our 1, 2, 3 etc. comes from the Phoenicians through the Arabs.&nbsp; You need no 
    more of Greek and Hebrew than these values, some sacred words&mdash;knowledge grows by 
    use&mdash;and books of reference.</p>

    <p>One cannot set a pupil definite tasks beyond the groundwork I am giving you, and we 
    should find this correspondence taking clear shape of its own accord.&nbsp; You have really 
    more than you can do already.&nbsp; And I can only tell you what the right tasks&mdash;out 
    of hundreds&mdash;are by your own reactions to your own study and practice.</p>

    <p>&quot;Osiris in Amennti&quot;&mdash;see the <em>Book of the Dead</em>.&nbsp; I meant you might 
    try to trace a parallelism between his journeyings and the Path of Initiation.</p>

    <p>Astral travel&mdash;development of the Astral Body is essential to research;
    and, above all, to the attainment of &quot;the Knowledge and Conversation of the 
    Holy Guardian Angel.&quot;</p>

    <p>You ought to demonstrate your performance of the Pentagram Ritual to me; you are 
    probably making any number of mistakes.&nbsp; I will, of course, take you carefully 
    through the O.T.O. rituals to III&deg; as soon as you are fairly familiar with them.&nbsp;

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>Yours of yestere'en came to gladden me just when the whole evening lay    
    blank before me: the one job such a big job that I simply can't get down
    to it until I get help: How annoying!&nbsp; Still, yours the gain!</p>

    <p>1. That verse (AL. I, 44</a>) condenses 
    the whole magical technique.&nbsp; It makes clearwhen you have understood 
    it&mdash;the secret of success in the Great Work.&nbsp; Of course at first 
    it appears a paradox.&nbsp; You must have an aim, and one aim only: yet on 
    no account must you want to achieve it!!!</p>

    <p>Those chapters of <em>The Book of Lies</em> quoted in my last letter<a href="#H1">*</a> 
    do throw some light onto this Abyss of self-contradiction; and there is meaning much
    deeper than the contrast between the Will with a capital W, and desire, want, or velleity.&nbsp; 
    The main point seems to be that in aspiring to Power one is limited by the True Will.&nbsp; If 
    you use force, violating your own nature either from lack of understanding or from petulant whim, 
    one is merely wasting energy; things go back to normal as soon as the stress is removed.&nbsp;
    This is one small case of the big Equation &quot;Free Will = Necessity&quot; (Fate, Destiny, or 
    Karma: it's all much the same idea).&nbsp; One is most rigidly bound by the causal chain that 
    has dragged one to where one is; but it is one's own self that has forged the links.</p>

    <p>Please refrain from the obvious retort: &quot;Then, in the long run, you can't possibly go 
    wrong: so it doesn't matter what you do.&quot;&nbsp; Perfectly true, of course!&nbsp; (There 
    is no single grain of dust that shall not attain to Buddhahood:&quot; with some such words 
    did the debauched old reprobate seek to console himself when Time began to take its revenge.)&nbsp; 
    But the answer is simple enough: you happen to be the kind of being that thinks it does matter
    what course you steer; or, still more haughtily, you enjoy the pleasure of sailing.</p>

    <p>No, there is this factor in all success: self-confidence.&nbsp; If we analyze this, 
    we find that it means that one is aware that all one's mental and physical faculties are 
    working harmoniously.&nbsp; The deadliest and subtlest enemy of that feeling is anxiety 
    about the result; the finest gauze of doubt is enough to dim one's vision, to throw the 
    entire field out of focus.&nbsp; Hence, even to be aware that there is a result in 
    prospect must militate against that serenity of spirit which is the essence of self-confidence.
    As you will know, all our automatic physiological functions are deranged if one is aware of 
    &nbsp; This then, is the difficulty, to enjoy consciously while not disturbing the process 
    involved.&nbsp; The obvious physical case is the sexual act: perhaps its chief importance 
    is just that it is a type of this exceptional spiritual-mental condition.&nbsp; I hope, however, 
    that you will remember what I have said on the subject in paragraphs 15&ndash;17 of my 3rd Lecture 
    on <em>Yoga for Yellowbellies</em> (pp. 71-72); there is a way of obtaining ecstacy from the most 
    insignificant physiological function.&nbsp; Observe that in transferring the whole consciousness 
    to (say) one's little finger or big toe is not trying to interfere with the normal exercise of
    its activities, but only to realize what is going on in the organism, the exquisite pleasure 
    of a function in its normal activity.&nbsp; With a little imagination one can conceive the 
    analogical case of the Universe itself; and, still less fettered by even the mildest limitation 
    which material symbols necessarily (however little) suggest, &quot;Remember all ye that existence 
    is pure joy;&nbsp;...&quot; (AL, II, 9</a>).</p>

    <p>Is it too bold to suggest that the gradual merging of all these Ways into an interwoven 
    unity may be taken as one mode of presentation of the Accomplishment of the Great Work itself?</p>

    <p>At least, I feel fairly satisfied the  meditation of them severally and jointly may help 
    you to an answer to your first question.</p>

    <p>2. Most people in my experience either cook up a hell-broth of self-induced obstacles to 
    success in Astral traveling, or else shoot forth on the wings of romantic imagination and fool 
    themselves for the rest of their lives in the manner of the Village Idiot.&nbsp; Yours, luckily, 
    is the former trouble.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;is it plain obstinacy?&mdash;you do not exercise the sublime Art of Guru-bullying.&nbsp;  
    You should have made one frenzied leap to my dying bed, thrust aside the cohorts of Mourning 
    Archimandrites, and wrung my nose until I made you do it.</p>

    <p>And you repeatedly insist that it is difficult.&nbsp; It isn't.&nbsp; Is there, however, some 
    deep-seated inhibition&mdash;a (Freudian) fear of success?&nbsp; Is there some connection with 
    that sense of guilt which is born in all but the very few?</p>

    <p>But you don't give it a fair chance.  There is, I admit, some trick, or knack, about 
    getting properly across; a faculty which one acquires (as a rule) quite suddenly and 
    unexpectedly.&nbsp; Rather like mastering some shots at billiards.&nbsp; Practice has 
    taught me how to communicate this to students; only in rare cases does one fail.&nbsp; 
    (It's incredible: one man simply could not be persuaded that intense physical exertion 
    was the wrong way to to it.&nbsp; There he sat, with the veins on his forehead almost 
    on the point of bursting, and the arms of my favourite chair visibly trembling beneath 
    his powerful grip!)&nbsp; In your case, I notice that you have got this practice mixed up
    with Dharana: you write of &quot;Emptying my mind of everything except the one idea, 
    <em>etc</em>.&quot; Then you go on: &quot;The invoking of a supersensible Being is impossible 
    to me as yet.&quot;&nbsp; The impudence!&nbsp; The arrogance!&nbsp; How do you know, pray 
    madam?&nbsp; (Dial numbers at random: the results are often surprisingly delightful!)&nbsp; 
    Besides, I didn't ask you to invoke a supersensible (what a word! Meaning?) Being right 
    away, or at any time: that supersensible is getting on my nerves: do you mean &quot;not 
    in normal circumstances to be apprehended by the senses?&quot;&nbsp; I suppose so.</p>

    <p>In a word: do fix a convenient season for going on the Astral Plane under my eye: half 
    an hour (with a bit of luck) on not more than four evenings would put you in a very 
    different frame of mind.&nbsp; You will soon &quot;feel your feet&quot; and then &quot;get 
    your sea-legs&quot; and then, much sooner than you think</p>

    <p>&quot;Afloat in the aethyr, O my God! my God!&quot;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 
    &quot;White swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings!&quot;</p>

    <p>3. Now then to your old Pons Asinorum about the names of the Gods!  Stand in the corner 
    for half an hour with your face to the wall!&nbsp; Stay in after school and write Malka 
    be-Tharshishim v-Ruachoth b-Schehalim 999 times!</p>

    <p>My dear, dear, dear sister, a name is a <em>formula of power</em>.&nbsp; How can you talk
    of &quot;anachronism&quot; when the Being is eternal?&nbsp; For the type of energy is eternal.</p>

    <p>Every name is a number: and &quot;Every number is infinite; there is no difference.&quot; 
    (AL I, 4).&nbsp; But one Name, or system of Names, may be more convenient either (a) to you 
    personally or (b) to the work you are at.&nbsp; <em>E.g.</em> I have very little sympathy with 
    Jewish Theology or ritual; but the Qabalah is so handy and congenial that I use it more than 
    almost any&mdash;or all the others together&mdash;for daily use and work.&nbsp; The Egyptian 
    Theogony is the noblest, the most truly magical, the most bound to me (or rather I to it) by 
    some inmost instinct, and by the memory of my incarnation as Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, that I use it 
    (with its Gr&aelig;co-Phoenician child) for all work of supreme import.&nbsp; Why stamp my 
    vitals, madam!&nbsp; The Abramelin Operation itself turned into this form before I could so 
    much as set to work on it!&nbsp; Like the Duchess' baby (excuse this enthusiasm; but you have 
    aroused the British Lion-Serpent.)</p>

    <p>Note, please, that the equivalents given in <em>777</em> are not always exact.&nbsp; Tahuti 
    is not quite Thoth, still less Hermes; Mercury is a very much more comprehensive idea, but not 
    nearly so exalted: Hanuman hardly at all.&nbsp; Nor is Tetragrammaton IAO, though even etymology 
    asserts the identity.</p>

    <p>In these matters you must be catholic, eclectic, even syncretic.&nbsp; And you must consider 
    the nature of your work.&nbsp; If I wanted to evoke Taphthartharath, there would be little help 
    indeed from any but the Qabalistic system; for that spirit's precise forms and numbers are not 
    to be found in any other.</p>

    <p>The converse, however, is not so true.&nbsp; The Qabalah, properly understood, properly treated, 
    is so universal that one can vamp up a ritual to suit almost &quot;any name and form.&quot;&nbsp; 
    But in such a case one may expect to have to reinforce it by a certain amount of historical, 
    literary, or philosophic study&mdash;and research.</p>

    <p>4. Quite right, dear lady, about your incarnation memories acting as a &quot;Guide to the Way 
    Back.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, if you &quot;missed an Egyptian Incarnation,&quot; you would not be 
    so likely to be a little Martha, worried &quot;about much serving.&quot;&nbsp; Don't get surfeited 
    with knowledge, above all things; it is so very fascinating, so dreadfully easy; and the danger of 
    becoming a pedant&mdash;&quot;Deuce take all your pedants! say I.&quot;&nbsp; Don't &quot;dry-rot 
    at ease 'till the Judgment Day.&quot;</p>

    <p>No, I will NOT recommend a book.&nbsp; It should not hurt you too much to browse on condensed 
    hay (or thistles) such as articles in Encyclopedias.&nbsp; Take <em>Roget's Thesaurus</em> or 
    <em>Smith's Smaller Classical Dictionary</em> (and the like) to read yourself to sleep on.&nbsp;
    But don't stultify yourself by taking up such study too seriously.&nbsp; You only make yourself 
    ridiculous by trying to do at 50 what you ought to have done at 15.&nbsp; As you didn't&mdash;tant 
    pis!&nbsp; You can't possibly get the <em>spirit</em>; if you could, it would mean merely mental 
    indigestion.&nbsp;  We have all read how Cato started to learn Greek at 90: <em>but the story stops 
    there</em>.&nbsp; We have never been told what good it did to himself or anyone else.</p>

    <p>5. God-forms.&nbsp; See <em>Magick</em> pp. 378-9</a>.&nbsp; Quite clear: quite adequate: no use at 
    all without continual practice.&nbsp; No one can join with you --- off you go again!  No, no, a 
    thousand times no: this is the practice par excellence where you have to do it all yourself.&nbsp; 
    The Vibration of God-names: that perhaps, I can at least test you in.&nbsp; But don't you dare 
    come up for a test until you've been at it&mdash;and <em>hard</em>&mdash;for at least 100 exercises.</p>

    <p>I think this is your trouble about being &quot;left in the air.&quot;&nbsp; When I &quot;present
    many new things&quot; to you, the sting is in the tail&mdash;the practice that vitalizes it.&nbsp; 
    Doctrinal stuff is fine &quot;Lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily, in the noo-on-dye shaun!&quot;&nbsp; 
    An ounce of your practice is worth a ton of my teaching.&nbsp; GET THAT.&nbsp; It's all your hatred 
    of hard work:</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;Go to the ant thou sluggard!<br>
      Consider her ways and be&mdash;&mdash;.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>I am sure that Solomon was too good a poet, and too experienced a Guru, to tail off with the 
    anticlimax &quot;wise.&quot;</p>

    <p>6. <em>Minerval</em>.&nbsp; What is the matter?&nbsp; All you have to do is understand it:
    just a dramatization of the process of incarnation.&nbsp; Better run through it with me: 
    I'll make it clear, and you can make notes of your troubles and their solution for the use of 
    future members.</p>

    <p>7. <em>The Book of Thoth</em>&nbsp; Surely all terms not in a good dictionary are explained 
    in the text.&nbsp; I don't see what I can do about it, in any case; the same criticism would 
    apply to (say) Bertrand Russell's <em>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</em>, wouldn't it?</p>

    <p>Is x an R-ancestor of y if y has every R-hereditary that x has, provided x is a term which has 
    the relation R to something or to which something has the relation R?&nbsp; (Enthusiastic cries of 
    &quot;Yes, it is!&quot;)&nbsp; He says &quot;A number is anything which has the number of some 
    class.&quot;&nbsp; Feel better now?</p>

    <p>Still, it would be kind of you to go through a page or so with me, and tell
    me where the shoe pinches.&nbsp; Of course I have realized the difficulty long
    ago; but I don't know the solution&mdash;or if there is a solution.&nbsp; I <em>did</em>
    think of calling <em>Magick</em> &quot;<em>Magick Without Tears</em>&quot;; and I <em>did</em> 
    try having my work cross-examined as I went on by minds of very inferior education or
    capacity.&nbsp; In fact, Parts I and II of <em>Book 4</em> were thus tested.</p>

    <p>What about applying the Dedekindian cut to this letter?  I am sure you would not wish 
    it to develop into a Goclenian Sorites, especially as I fear that I may already have deviated 
    from the &delta;&iota;&alpha; &pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; Hapaxlegomenon.</p>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</em></p>

    <p>It is very good hearing that these letters do good, but rather sad to reflect 
    that it is going to make you so unpopular.&nbsp; Your friends will notice at once 
    that glib vacuities fail to impress, and hate you, and tell lies about you.&nbsp; 
    It's worth it.</p>

    <p>Yes, your brain is quite all right; what is wanted is to acquire the habit
    of pinning things down instantly.&nbsp; (He says 're-incarnation'&mdash;now what
    <em>exactly</em> does he mean by that?&nbsp; He says &quot;it is natural to suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&quot;:
    what is &quot;natural&quot;, and what is implied by supposition?)&nbsp; Practice this style
    of criticism; write down what happens.&nbsp; Within a week or two you will be
    astounded to discover that you have got what is apparently little less than
    a new brain!&nbsp; You must make this a habit, not letting anything get by the
    sentries.</p>

    <p>Indeed, I want you to go even further; make sure of what is meant by even the 
    simplest words.  Trace the history of the word with the help of Skeat's <em>Etymological 
    Dictionary</em>.&nbsp; E.g. &quot;pretty&quot; means tricky, deceitful; on the other hand, 
    &quot;hussy&quot; is only &quot;housewife.&quot;&nbsp; It's amusing, too, this &quot;tabby&quot;
    refers to Prince Attab, the grandson of Ommeya&mdash;the silk quarter of Baghdad where utabi, 
    a rich watered silk was sold.&nbsp; This will soon give you the power of discerning instantly 
    when words are being used to hide meaning or lack of it.</p>

    <p>About A.'.A.'., etc.: your resolution is noble, but there is a letter ready for you which 
    deals with what is really a legitimate enquiry; necessary, too, with so many hordes of &quot;Hidden 
    Masters&quot; and &quot;Mahatmas&quot; and so on scurrying all over the floor in the hope of 
    distracting attention from the inanities of their trusted henchmen.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>

    <p>P.S. I must write at length about the Higher Self or &quot;God within us,&quot; 
    too easy to get muddled about it, and the subject requires careful preparation.</p>
