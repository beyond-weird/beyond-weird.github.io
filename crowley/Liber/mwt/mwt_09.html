    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter IX: The Secret Chiefs</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Very glad I am, since at one time I was obliged to be starkly stern
    about impertinent curiosity, to note that your wish to be informed about
    the Secret Chiefs of the A.'.A.'. is justified; it is most certainly of
    the first importance that you and I should be quite clear in our minds
    about Those under whose jurisdiction and tutelage we both work.</p>

    <p>The question is beset with thickets of tough thorn; what is worse, the
    path is so slippery that nothing is easier than to tumble head first
    into the spikiest bush of them all.</p>

    <p>You justly remind me that one of my earliest slogans was &quot;Mystery is the
    enemy of Truth;&quot;<!-- insert note re this --> how then is it what I acquiesce in the policy 
    of concealment in a matter so cardinal?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the best plan is for me to set down the facts of the case, so
    far as is possible, from them it may appear that no alternative policy
    is feasible.</p>

    <p>The first condition of membership of the A.'.A.'. is that one is sworn
    to identify one's own Great Work with that of raising mankind to higher
    levels, spiritually, and in every other way.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, it stands to reason that those charged with the conduct of
    the Order should be at least Masters of the Temple, or their judgment
    would be worthless, and at least Magi (though not that particular kind
    of Magus who brings the Word of a New Formula to the world every 2,000
    years of so) or they would be unable to influence events on any scale
    commensurate with the scope of the Work.</p>

    <p>Of what nature is this Power, this Authority, this Understanding, this
    Wisdom&mdash;Will?</p>

    <p>(I go up from Geburah to Chokmah.)</p>

    <p>Of the passive side it is comparatively easy to form some idea; for the
    qualities essential are mainly extensions of those that all of us possess
    in some degree.&nbsp; And whether Understanding - Wisdom is &quot;right&quot; 
    or &quot;wrong&quot; must be largely a matter of opinion; often Time only can 
    decide such points.</p>

    <p>But for the active side it is necessary to postulate the existence of a
    form of Energy at their disposal which is able &quot;to cause change to occur
    in conformity with the Will&quot;&mdash;one definition of &quot;Magick.&quot;</p>

    <p>Now this, as you know, is an exceedingly complex subject; its theory
    is tortuous, and its practice encompassed with every kind of difficulty.</p>

    <p>Is there no simple method?</p>

    <p>Yes: the thaumaturgic engine disposes of a type of energy more adaptable
    than Electricity itself, and both stronger and subtler than this, its
    analogy in the world of profane science.&nbsp; One might say, that it 
    is electrical, or at least one of the elements in the &quot;Ring-formula&quot; 
    of modern Mathematical Physics.</p>

    <p>In the R.R. et A.C., this is indicated to the Adept Minor by the title
    conferred upon him on his initiation to that grade: Hodos Camelionis:&mdash;the 
    Path of the Chameleon.&nbsp; (This emphasizes the omnivalence of the force.)&nbsp; 
    In the higher degrees of O.T.O.&mdash;the A.'.A.'. is not fond of terms like this, 
    which verge on the picturesque&mdash;it is usually called &quot;the Ophidian 
    Vibrations,&quot; thus laying special stress upon its serpentine strength, 
    subtlety, its control of life and death, and its power to insinuate itself into 
    any desired set of circumstances.</p>

    <p>It is of this universally powerful weapon that the Secret Chiefs must be
    supposed to possess complete control.</p>

    <p>They can induce a girl to embroider a tapestry, or initiate a political
    movement to culminate in a world-war; all in pursuit of some plan wholly
    beyond the purview or the comprehension of the deepest and subtlest
    thinkers.</p>

    <p>(It should go without saying that the adroit use of these vibrations
    enables one to perform all the classical &quot;miracles.&quot;)</p>

    <p>These powers are stupendous: they seem almost beyond imagination to
    conceive.</p>
    <blockquote>
      &quot;Hic ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono;<br>
      Imperium sine fine dedi.&quot;
    </blockquote>
    <p>as Vergil, that mighty seer and magician of Rome at her perihelion says
    in his First Book of the <em>Aenead</em>.&nbsp; (Vergil whose every line is also an
    Oracle, the leaves of his book more sacred, more significant, more sure
    than those of the Cumaean Sibyl!)</p>

    <p>These powers move in dimensions of time and space quite other than those
    with which we are familiar.&nbsp; Their values are incomprehensible to us.&nbsp;
    To a Secret Chief, wielding this weapon, &quot;The nice conduct of a clouded
    cane&quot; might be infinitely more important than a war, famine and pestilence 
    such as might exterminate a third part of the race, to promote whose welfare 
    is the crux of His oath, and the sole reason of His existence!</p>

    <p>But who <em>are</em> They?</p>

    <p>Since They are &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;inaccessible,&quot; may They not merely be
    figments invented by a self-styled &quot;Master,&quot; not quite sure of himself, to prop 
    his tottering Authority?</p>

    <p>Well, the &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;inaccessible&quot; criticism may equally 
    be leveled at Captain A. and Admiral B. of the Naval Intelligence Department.&nbsp; 
    These &quot;Secret Chiefs&quot; keep in the dark for precisely the same reasons; 
    and these qualities disappear instantaneously the moment <em>They</em> want to get 
    hold of <em>you</em>.</p>

    <p>It is written, moreover, "Let my servants be few &amp; secret: they shall
    rule the many &amp; the known."  (AL I, 10)</p>

    <p>But are They then men, in the usual sense of the word?&nbsp; They may be
    incarnate or discarnate: it is a matter of Their convenience.</p>

    <p>Have They attained Their position by passing through all the grades of the A.'.A.'.?</p>

    <p>Yes and no: the system which was given to me to put forward is only
    one of many.&nbsp; &quot;Above the Abyss&quot; all these technical wrinkles 
    are ironed out.&nbsp; One man whom I suspect of being a Secret Chief has hardly 
    any acquaintance with the technique of our system at all.&nbsp; That he accepts
    <em>The Book of the Law</em> is almost his only link with my work.&nbsp; That, and
    his use of the Ophidian Vibrations: I don't know which of us is better at it, 
    but I am sure that he must be a very long way ahead of me if he is one of Them.</p>

    <p>You have already in these pages and elsewhere in my writings examples
    numerous and varied of the way in which They work.&nbsp; The list is far
    from complete.&nbsp; The matters of Ab-ul-Diz and of Amalantrah show one
    method of communication; then there is the way of direct &quot;inspiration,&quot;
    as in the case of &quot;Hermes Eimi&quot; in New Orleans.<a href="#ac1">*</a></p>

    <p>Again, They may send an ordinary living man, whether one of Themselves
    or no I cannot feel sure, to instruct me in some task, or to set me
    right when I have erred.&nbsp; Then there have been messages conveyed by
    natural objects, animate or inanimate.<a href="#ac2">&#134;</a>&nbsp; 
    Needless to say, the outstanding example in my life is the whole Plan of 
    Campaign concerning <em>The Book of the Law</em>.&nbsp; But is Aiwaz a man 
    (presumably a Persian or Assyrian) and a &quot;Secret Chief,&quot; or is 
    He an &quot;angel&quot; in the sense that Gabriel is an angel?&nbsp; Is Ab-ul-Diz 
    an Adept who can project himself into the aura of some woman with whom I happen 
    to be living, although she has no previous experience of the kind, or any interest 
    in such matters at all?&nbsp; Or is He a being whose existence is altogether 
    beyond this plane, only adopting human appearance and faculties in order to make Himself 
    sensible and intelligible to that woman?</p>

    <p>I have never attempted to pursue any such enquiry.&nbsp; It was not forbidden;
    and yet I felt that it was!  I always insisted, of course, on the strictest 
    proof that He actually possessed the authority claimed by Him!&nbsp; But
    I felt is improper to assume any other initiative.&nbsp; Just a point of good
    manners, perhaps?</p>

    <p>You ask whether, contact once made,  I am able to renew it should I so
    wish.&nbsp; Again, yes and no.&nbsp; But the real answer is that no such gesture
    on my part can ever be necessary.&nbsp; For one thing, the &quot;Chief&quot; is so far
    above me that I can rely on Him to take the necessary steps, whenever contact would 
    be useful; for another, there is one path always open which is perfectly sufficient 
    for all possible contingencies.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere I will explain why they picked out so woebegone a ragamuffin
    as myself to proclaim the Word of the Aeon, and do all the chores appur-
    tenant to that particular Work.</p>

    <p>The Burden is heavier as the years go by; but&mdash;Perdurabo.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.  Reading this typescript over for &quot;literals,&quot; it struck me that you
    would ask, very reasonably: &quot;But if the Secret Masters have these boundless 
    powers, why do They allow you to be plagued by printers, held up for lack of 
    secretaries, worried by all sorts of practical problems? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, 
    in a word, does anything ever go wrong?&quot;</p>

    <p>There are several lines of reply; coalescing, they suffice:</p>

    <p>1.&nbsp; What is &quot;wrong?&quot;&nbsp; Since four wars is Their idea of &quot;right,&quot; 
    you may well ask by what standard you may judge events.</p>

    <p>2.&nbsp; Their Work is creative; They operate on the dull mass of unrealized
    possibilities.&nbsp; Thus they meet, firstly, the opposition of Inertia;
    secondly, the recoil, the reaction, the rebound.</p>

    <p>3.&nbsp; Things theoretically feasible are practically impossible when (<em>a</em>)
    desirable though their accomplishment may be, it is not the one feat
    essential to the particular Work in hand and the moment; (<em>b</em>) the sum
    total of available energy being used up by that special task, there is
    none available for side-issues; (<em>c</em>) the opposition, passive or active,
    is too strong, temporarily, to overcome.</p>

    <p>More largely, one cannot judge how a plan is progressing when one has
    no precise idea what it is.&nbsp; A soldier is told to &quot;attack;&quot; he may 
    be intended to win through, to cover a general retreat, or to gain time by
    deliberate sacrifice.&nbsp; Only the Commander in Chief knows what the order
    means, or why he issues it; and even he does not know the issue, or
    whether it will display and justify his military skill and judgment.</p>

    <p>Our business is solely to obey orders: our responsibility ends when we
    have satisfied ourselves that they emanate from a source which has the
    right to command.</p>

    <p>P.P.S.&nbsp; A visitor's story has just reminded me of the possibility that
    I am a Secret Chief myself without knowing it: for I have sometimes
    been recognized by other people as having acted as such, though I was
    not aware of the fact at the time.</p>
    
    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> I will remember to give you details of these incidents when the occasion arises.</p>
    <p id="ac2"><b>&#134;</b> One thing I regard from my own experience as certain: when you call,
    They come.&nbsp; The circumstances usually show that the call had been foreseen, 
    and preparations made to answer it, long before it was made.&nbsp; But I suppose in 
    some way the call has to justify the making.</p>
