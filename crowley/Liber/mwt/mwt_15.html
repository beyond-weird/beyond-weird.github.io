    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XV: Sex Morality</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,

    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Thank you!&nbsp; I am to cover the whole question of sex in a few well-chosen
    words?&nbsp; Am I to suppose that you want to borrow money?&nbsp; Such fulsome
    flattery suggests the indirect approach.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, your proposal is not so outrageous as it sounds at
    first; for as far as the English language goes, there is really hardly
    anything worth reading.&nbsp; 98.138 per cent of it is what Frances Ridley
    Ravergal used to call &quot;fiddlesticks, blah, boloney, Bull-shit, and the
    bunk.&quot;</p>

    <p>However, quite recently I issued an Encyclical to the Faithful with the
    attractive title of Artemis Iota</a>, and I propose that we read this into
    the record, to save trouble, and because it gives a list of practically
    all the classics that you ought to read.  Also, it condenses information
    and advice to &quot;beginners,&quot; with due reference to the positive injunctions
    given in The Book of the Law</a>.</p>

    <p>Still, for the purpose of these letters, I should like to put the whole
    matter in a nutshell.&nbsp; The Tree of Life, as usual, affords a convenient
    means of classification.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To the physical side of it psychological laws apply.&nbsp; &quot;Don't
      monkey with the buzz-saw!&quot; as John Wesley might have put it, though I doubt whether he did.</li>
      <li>The &quot;moral&quot; side.&nbsp; As in the case of the voltage of a cissoid,
      there isn't one.&nbsp; Mind your own business! is the sole sufficient
      rule.&nbsp; To drag in social, economic, religious, and such aspects
      is irrelevance and impurity.</li>
      <li>The Magical side.&nbsp; Sex is, directly or indirectly, the most
      powerful weapon in the armoury of the Magician; and precisely
      because there is no moral guide, it is indescribably dangerous.
      I have given a great many hints, especially in <em>Magick</em>, and <em>The
      Book of Thoth</em>&mdash;some of the cards are almost blatantly revealing;
      so I have been rapped rather severely over the knuckles for
      giving children matches for playthings.&nbsp; My excuse has been that
      they have already got the matches, that my explanations have been
      directed to add conscious precautions to the existing automatic safeguards.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The above remarks refer mainly to the technique of the business; and it
    is going a very long way to tell you that you ought to be able to work
    out the principles thereof from your general knowledge of Magick, but
    especially the Formula of Tetragrammaton, clearly stated and explained
    in <em>Magick</em>, Chap. III.&nbsp; Combine this with the heart of Chap. XII and
    you've got it!</p>

    <p>But there is another point at issue.&nbsp; This incidentally, is where the
    &quot;automatic safeguards&quot; come in.  &quot;...thou hast no right but to do thy will.&quot;
    (AL I, 42</a>) means that to &quot;go anwhoring after strange&quot; 
    purposes can only be disastrous.&nbsp; It is possible, in chemistry, to provoke an endothermic
    reaction; but that is only asking for trouble.&nbsp; The product bears within its own heart the 
    seed of dissolution.&nbsp; Accordingly, the most important preliminary to any Magical operation 
    is to make sure that its object is not only harmonious with, but necessary to, your Great Work.</p>

    <p>Note also that the use of this supreme method involves the manipulation
    of energies ineffably secret and most delicately sensitive; it compares
    with the operations of ordinary Magick as the last word in artillery does
    with the blunderbuss!</p>

    <p>I ought to have mentioned the sexual instinct or impulse in itself, careless of magical or 
    any other considerations soever: the thing that picks you up by the scruff of the neck, slits 
    your weasand with a cavalry sabre, and chucks the remains over the nearest precipice.</p>

    <p>What <em>is</em> the damn thing, anyway?</p>

    <p>That's just the trouble; for it is the <em>first</em> of the masks upon the face
    of the True Will; and that mask is the Poker-Face!</p>

    <p>As all true Art is spontaneous, is genius, is utterly beyond all conscious
    knowledge or control, so also is sex.&nbsp; Indeed, one might class it as
    deeper still than Art; for Art does at least endeavour to find an intelligible 
    means of expression.&nbsp; That is much nearer to sanity than the blind lust 
    of the sex-impulse.&nbsp; The maddest genius does look from Chokmah
    not only to Binah, but to the fruit of that union in Da'ath and the Ruach;
    the sex-impulse has no use for Binah to understand, to interpret, to
    transmit.&nbsp; It wants no more than an instrument which will destroy it.</p>

    <p>&quot;Here, I say, Master, have a heart!&quot;</p>

    <p>Nonsense!&nbsp; (I continue)&nbsp; What I say is the plain fact, and well you know
    it!&nbsp; More, damned up, hemmed in, twisted and tortured as it has been by
    religion and morality and all the rest of it, it has learnt to disguise
    itself, to appear in a myriad forms of psychosis, neurosis, actual insanity 
    of the most dangerous types.&nbsp; You don't have to look beyond Hitler!&nbsp;
    Its power and its peril derive directly from the fatal fact that in itself it 
    is the True Will in its purest form.</p>

    <p>What then is the magical remedy?&nbsp; Obvious enough to the Qabalist.&nbsp; &quot;Love
    is the law, love under will.&quot;&nbsp; It must be fitted at its earliest manifestations 
    with its proper Binah, so as to flow freely along the Path of Daleth, and restore the lost 
    Balance.&nbsp; Attempts to suppress it are fatal, to sublime it are false and futile.&nbsp; 
    But guided wisely from the start, by the time it becomes strong it has learnt how to use 
    its virtues to the best advantage.</p>

    <p>And what of the parallel instinct in a woman?&nbsp; Except in (rather rare)
    cases of congenital disease or deformity, the problem is never so acute.</p>

    <p>For Binah, even while she winks a Chokmah, has the other eye wide-open,
    swivelled on Tiphareth.&nbsp; Her True Will is thus divided by Nature from the
    start, and her tragedy is if she fails to unite these two objects.&nbsp; Oh,
    dear me, yes, I know all about &quot;<em>spret&aelig; injuria form&aelig;</em>&quot; 
    and &quot;<em>furens quid femina possit</em>&quot;; but that is only because when she 
    misses her bite she feels doubly baffled, robbed not only of the ecstatic Present, but 
    of the glamorous Future.&nbsp; If she eat independently of the Fruit of the Tree
    of Life when unripe, she has not only the bad taste in the mouth, but indigestion to 
    follow.&nbsp; Then, living as she does so much in the world of imagination, constantly 
    living shadow-pictures of her Desire, she is not nearly so liable to the violent 
    insanities of sheer blind lust, as is the male.&nbsp; The essential difference is 
    indicated by that of their respective orgasms, the female undulatory, the male 
    catastrophic.</p>

    <p>The above, taken all in all, may not be fully comprehensive, not wholly
    satisfying to the soul, but one thing with another, enough for a cow to
    chew the cud on.</p>

    <p>Good night!</p>
