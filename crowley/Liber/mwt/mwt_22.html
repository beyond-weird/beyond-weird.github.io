    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXII: How to Learn the Practice of Astrology</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>&quot;Up guards, and at 'em!&quot;&nbsp; First, you must know your correspondences 
    by heart backwards and upside down (air connu.)&nbsp; They are practically all
    in <em>The Book of Thoth</em>; but &quot;if anyone anything lacks,&quot; look for it in
    <em>777</em>.</p>

    <p>Then, get a book on Astrology, the older the better.&nbsp; Raphael's <em>Shilling
    Handbook</em> is probably enough for the present purpose.  Get well into your
    head what the menu says about the natures of the planets, the influence
    of the aspects, what is meant by dignities, the scope of the houses, and so on.</p>

    <p>Dovetail all this with your classical knowledge; the character and
    qualities, the powers and the exploits, of the several deities concerned.</p>

    <p>Next, learn how to set up a figure of the heavens.  This need not take an
    average intelligent person more than an hour at the most.  You can learn
    it from a book.&nbsp; Lastly, get Barley's <em>1001 Notable nativities</em> and 
    <em>More Nativites</em>.&nbsp; Also any other collections available.&nbsp; 
    Practice setting up the horoscopes.&nbsp; Use the Chaldean square system; 
    it shows at the first glance what is happening in the angular houses, 
    which are the keys of the whole figure.</p>

    <p>Compare and contrast what you know of the natives, from history, with
    what is said of the aspects (and the rest) in the books you have read.</p>

    <p>Put together similar horoscopes; e.g. a dozen which have Sagittarius
    rising, another lot with Jupiter in the mid-heaven, and so on; see if
    you can find a similarity in their lives with what the books will have
    led you to expect.</p>

    <p>Don't be afraid to criticise; on the contrary, do some research work on
    your own, and find cases which seem to contradict tradition.</p>

    <p>Instance: Saturn in the M.C. is said to cause a spectacular rise in a
    man's career, ending in an equally notable crash.  Examples: Napoleon I
    and III, Oscar Wilde, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Northcliffe, Hitler.&nbsp; Look for
    figures with Saturn thus placed, whose natives have jogged along equably
    and died in the odour of sanctity.&nbsp; Find out why what worked in some
    cases failed in the others.</p>

    <p>By the time you have studied (say) 500 nativities you will be already a
    fairly competent judge.&nbsp; Work your bloody guns! as Kipling says; get a
    friend&mdash;just this once I allow you human intercourse&mdash;to set up for you
    figures of historical importance, or with some outstanding characteristic
    (e.g. murderers, champions of sport, statesmen, monsters, philanthropists,
    heresiarchs) without telling you to whom it refers.</p>

    <p>Build up the character, profession, story from the nativity.  It sounds
    incredible; but more than a score of times I have been actually able to
    name him!</p>

    <p>By the time you have got good at this game&mdash;and a most amusing game it
    is&mdash;you may call yourself a very competent astrologer.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, even now, you may assign the figure of the Archbishop of York
    to Jabez Balfour or Catherine de Medici; or mix up Moody and Sankey with
    Brown and Kennedy; don't be discouraged; perhaps there may be something
    to be said for you after all!</p>

    <p>I believe, as I hope, that you will be surprised at the speed with which
    you acquire proficiency.</p>

    <p>All this time, moreover, you have not been wholly idle.&nbsp; You will have
    been running about like a demented rabbit, and trying to spot the rising
    sign of everybody you know.&nbsp; Look at them full-face, then profile; and
    note salient characteristics, pendulous lips, receding chins, bulbous
    noses, narrow foreheads, stuck-out ears, pimples, squints, warts, shape
    of face (three main types; thin, jutting, for cardinal signs; square,
    steadfast for cherubic; weak, nondescript, for the rest); then the
    stature, whether lithe, well-knit, sturdy, muscular, fat or what not;
    in short every bodily feature in turn; make up your mind what sign was
    rising at birth, and stick to it!</p>

    <p>Now to verify your suspicions.&nbsp; The conversation may run thus:</p>

    <p>You: &quot;Can you answer a question without answering another which you were
    not asked?&quot;</p>

    <p>It, surprised: &quot;Why, yes, of course I can.&quot;</p>

    <p>You: &quot;Good. Then, do you know the date of the Battle of Waterloo?&quot;</p>

    <p>It: &quot;1815.&quot;</p>

    <p>You probably have to explain!  In any case you begin all over again, when
    he has contented himself with &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; you say 
    &quot;Do you know the hour of your birth?&quot;&nbsp; If he says &quot;No,&quot; 
    you ask if he can find out, and so on.&nbsp; If he says &quot;Yes;&quot; 
    &quot;Then tell me either the hour or the day and month; <em>but not both</em>.&quot;&nbsp; 
    If he gives you the hour, you calculate a bit, and say: &quot;Then you were born on the 
    <em>n</em>th of <em>X</em>ember, within a fortnight either way.&quot;</p>

    <p>If he tells you his birthday, work it out as before and then: &quot;You were
    born at P in the morning within an hour either way.&quot; (This makes it
    about 11 to 1 against your being right, in either case, on pure chance.)</p>

    <p>Again, you can practise this in caf&eacute;s, when you visit civilized countries,
    and it is often possible to scrape acquaintance with people who look
    specially interesting, and do not, as in England, instantly suspect you
    of dishonourable advances, and get them to play up.&nbsp; This is sometimes
    easier when you are already with that friend which I was so lax as to
    allow you; and it is, I own, very helpful to discuss strange faces if
    only to make it quite clear to your own mind why you decide on one as
    Virgo, another as Taurus.</p>

    <p>A strange thing happened once; I had explained all this to the girl
    that I happened to be living with: that is, I taught her the names of
    the signs; she knew no Astrology, net even the simple correspondences.
    After about a month, she was better at it than I was!&nbsp; (&quot;Why strange?&quot;
    you mutter rudely.&nbsp; &quot;Quite right, my dear!  I have always been a wretched
    reader of character.&nbsp; Bless my soul! there was a time when I had hopes
    of you,&quot; I savagely retort.)&nbsp; She had picked up the knack, the trick
    of it; she could select, eliminate, re-compose, compare with past experience, 
    and form a judgment, without knowing the names of its materials.</p>

    <p>When you have got your sea-legs at both these parts of your astrological
    education, you may (I think) put out to sea with some confidence.&nbsp; 
    Perhaps a fair test of your fitness would be when you got three people right 
    out of four, in a total of a score or so.  Well, allow for my being in a
    &quot;mood&quot; to-night; call it two out of three.&nbsp; If it were guesswork, 
    after all, that means you are bringing it off at seven to one.&nbsp; Obviously, 
    when you do go wrong, set up the figure, study it more carefully than ever,
    and find out what misled you.</p>

    <p>Remember constantly that the Statistical Method is your one and only
    safeguard against self-deception.</p>

    <p>Within the limits of a letter I could hardly hope to go into matters much
    more fully or deeply than I have done; but 'pon my soul!&nbsp; I think that
    what I have said should be enough for an intelligent and assiduous student.&nbsp;
    Let me insist that <em>all</em> that is worth while comes by experience.&nbsp; Learning
    one thing will give you the clue to another.</p>

    <p>Well do I know to my sorrow how hard it is, as a rule, to learn how to
    do a thing solely from written instruction; so perhaps you had better
    arrange to see me one day about the actual setting-up of a figure.&nbsp;
    Probably, too, there will be a few points that you would like to discuss.</p>

    <p>I will end by betting you six clothing coupons to a pound of sugar that
    in two years' concentrated work on these lines you will become a better
    astrologer than ever I was.&nbsp; (This is very cunning of me; in two years
    we shall all be getting clothes without coupons.)</p>
