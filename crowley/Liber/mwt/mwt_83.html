    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXXIII: Epistola Ultima</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>
        
    <p>The suggestion in your last letter to me is a very sensible one.&nbsp; I do
    think that people in general would like to get some idea of my system
    of training as a whole, in a comprehensive form.&nbsp; In the past there has
    been far too much of referring them to one quite unprocurable document
    and then to another which probably has not even been written.&nbsp; No wonder
    that they go away sorrowful.&nbsp; So I am going to put in as the last of
    this series of Letters an account, as clear and as succinct as the gods
    enable me to do, of what they may expect to have to do to get good marks
    from Grandfather.&nbsp; Of course I shall not be able to avoid altogether
    reference to the various official documents, but I will make these as
    short and as few as I can.</p>

    <p>First of all then, my system can be divided into two parts.&nbsp; Apparently
    diametrically opposed, but at the end converging, the one helping the
    other until the final method of progress partakes equally of both ele-
    ments.</p>

    <p>For convenience I shall call the first method Magick, and the second
    method Yoga.&nbsp; The opposition between these is very plain for the
    direction of Magick is wholly outward, that of Yoga wholly inward.</p>

    <p>I will deal first then with Magick.&nbsp; How do I define this word?</p>

    <p>Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in accordance
    with the will.&nbsp; (Obviously then all scientific methods can be included
    in this term.)</p>

    <p>I have to assume in all that follows that you have thoroughly understood 
    the doctrine of 0 = 2.</p>

    <p>All Magical action may be classed as under the formula of progression from 
    the &quot;0&quot; to the &quot;2&quot;; in other words it is complete extraversion.</p>

    <p>The aspiring Magician only analyses himself for the purpose of finding
    new worlds to conquer.&nbsp; His first objective is the astral plane; its
    discovery, the classification of its tenants, and their control.</p>

    <p>All his early practises therefore are devoted to exploring the worlds
    which surround (if you choose, or if your prefer&mdash;are contained in)
    the object of sense.&nbsp; If there is a tree in your garden, you want to
    find out whether that tree is occupied by a nymph or a nat, and if so,
    what are they like?&nbsp; How do they act?&nbsp; How can you make them useful to
    your purpose?&nbsp; It is in fact the ordinary every-day scientific method
    of exploration.&nbsp; The only difference is that in the course of one's
    experiments one becomes aware of parts of the nature of the object to
    be examined which are subtler and perhaps more powerful, nearer to
    reality, than those which ordinary scientific examination discloses.&nbsp;
    You will notice, however, that the qualities above-mentioned are identical.&nbsp; 
    The chemical elements which go to form a tree are subtler, more powerful 
    and nearer to reality than the tree as it is presented to the senses.</p>

    <p>Finally, we reach the conception of molecules, atoms, electrons, protons,
    neutrons and so on, and nobody needs telling nowadays what unfathomable
    potencies lie hidden in the atom.</p>

    <p>When I say subtler, moreover, I mean it.&nbsp; The analysis of matter has
    resulted in the extraordinary discovery that the definition of matter
    as given by the physicist of to-day is very similar indeed to the
    definition of spirit as stated by the mystics of the middle ages.</p>

    <p>Henry Poincar&eacute; has well pointed out that the results of scientific
    experiment as we know them, are altogether in their way dependant on
    the existence of our own peculiar natures.&nbsp; If, for example, we had no
    sense to use in our exploration but that of hearing, we should have
    worked out a classification of trees entirely different from that which
    we now possess.&nbsp; We should have taught our students how to distinguish
    the sounds made by an oak and an elm respectively in a storm; the
    differences in the rustling of various kinds of grass, and so on.</p>

    <p>Similarly the results of our magical experiments are naturally and
    necessarily very distinct from those which we obtain by ordinary
    methods.&nbsp; To begin with we must build up an apparatus of examination,
    and this we do by discovering and developing qualities in our own structure 
    which ware suitable for the purpose.</p>

    <p>The first step is the separation of (what we call, for convenience) the
    astral body from the physical body.&nbsp; As our experiments proceed, we find
    that our astral body itself can be divided into grosser and subtler 
    components.&nbsp; In this way we become aware of the existence of what we call,
    for convenience, the Holy Guardian Angel, and the more we realise the
    implications of the theory of the existence of such a being, the clearer
    it becomes that our supreme task is to put ourselves into intimate
    communication with him.</p>

    <p>For one thing, we shall find that in the object of sense which we
    examine there are elements which resist our examination.&nbsp; We must raise
    ourselves to a plane in which we obtain complete control of such.</p>

    <p>It is found furthermore in the course of experiment that a great many
    of the apparent differences in our study conceal a hidden unity, and
    vice versa.&nbsp; Like every other science, both the subject and the object
    of the work increase as that work proceeds.</p>

    <p>Take a simple matter like Mathematics as our analogy.&nbsp; The schoolboy
    struggling with the Rule of Three is a very rudimentary image of the
    advanced mathematician working on the differential calculus.</p>

    <p>From the above it ought to be clear to you that I have said all that
    really needs to be said in explaining the whole of Magick as the science
    and art of extending, first in oneself, one's own faculties, secondly
    in external nature their hidden characteristics.</p>

    <p>Before closing the subject entirely I think it well to point out that
    there are quite a number of worlds on which a good deal of work remains
    to be done.&nbsp; In particular I cannot refrain from mentioning the work of
    Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly.&nbsp; My own work on this subject has been so
    elaborate and extensive that I shall never sufficiently regret that I
    never had an opportunity of completing it, but I should like to emphasize 
    that the obtaining of a book like <em>Liber 418</em> is in itself so
    outstanding an achievement that it should serve as an encouragement to
    all Magicians.</p>

    <p>In the case of many worlds, in particular that of Abra Melin, of the
    greater and lesser Keys of Solomon, of Pietro di Abano,<!-- insert note re this --> 
    of Cornelius Agrippa, while we have perfectly adequate information as to the 
    methods we have very meagre examples of the results, especially so far as refers
    to the technical side of the work.</p>

    <p>I must conclude with a warning.&nbsp; So many of these branches of magick
    are so fascinating that any one of them is liable to take hold of the
    Magician by the short hair and upset his balance completely.&nbsp; It should
    never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential
    work of the Magicians is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation 
    of the Holy Guardian Angel.&nbsp; Once he has achieved this he must of
    course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably 
    and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step&mdash;crossing 
    of the abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.</p>

    <p>Anything apart from this course is a side issue and unless so regarded
    may lead to the complete ruin of the whole work of the Magician.</p>

    <h4 align="center">II</h4>

    <p>The second part of this letter, which appears to be expanding into a
    sort of essay, will be devoted to Yoga.&nbsp; You will have noticed that the
    grade of Master of the Temple is itself intimately associated with Yoga.&nbsp;
    It is when one reaches this plane that the apparently contradictory
    forms of the Great Work, Magick and Yoga, begin to converge, though even
    earlier in the course of the work it must have been noticed that achievements 
    in Yoga have been of great assistance to magical operations, and that many 
    of the mental states necessary to the development of the Magician are 
    identical with those attained in the course of the strictly technical 
    Yogic operations.</p>

    <p>The literature necessary to the study of Magick is somewhat variegated;
    there are quite a number of classics on the subject and though it would
    be easy enough for me to draw up a list of not more than half-a dozen
    which I consider really essential, there may be as many as an hundred
    which in the more or less subsidiary forms are useful to the magician.</p>

    <p>With Yoga the case is very different indeed.&nbsp; The literature on the
    subject is so enormous and contains so vast a number of more or less
    secret documents which circulate from hand to hand, that I believe
    that the best advice I can give anyone is to cut one's cloth very
    sparingly if one is to make a fitting suit.  I do not think I am going
    too far if I say that Part I of <em>Book 4</em> and my <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em>
    form an absolutely sufficient guide to the useful practise of the
    subject; anything else is almost certain to operate as a distraction.</p>

    <p>Swami Vivekananda summarised Yoga under four headings, and I do not
    think that one can improve on that classification.  His four are: Gnana,
    Raja, Bhakti and Hatha, and comprise all divisions that it is desirable
    to make.&nbsp; As soon as one begins to add such sections as Mantra Yoga, you
    are adding to without enriching the classification, and once you begin
    where are you to stop?&nbsp; But I honestly believe that the excessive
    simplication given in <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em> is a practical advantage.
    Any given type of Yogas is the work of a lifetime and for that reason
    alone it is desirable to confine oneself from the beginning to an
    absolutely simple programme.</p>

    <p>What then is the difference between Yoga and Magick?&nbsp; Magick is extraversion, 
    the discovery of and subsequently the classification of and finally the control 
    of new worlds on new planes.&nbsp; So far as it concerns the development of the 
    mind its object and method are perfectly simple.&nbsp; What is wanted is 
    exaltation.&nbsp; The aim is to identify oneself with the highest essence of 
    whatever world is under consideration.</p>

    <p>With Yoga you might easily slip into saying that it was identical, with
    the exception that the new worlds are from the start recognised as
    already existing within the human cosmos, but nobody is asked to extend
    these worlds in any way; on the contrary the object is to analyse ever
    more minutely, and the control to which one approaches is not external
    but internal.&nbsp; At all times one is concentrated on the idea of simpli-
    cation.&nbsp; The recognition of any new idea or form of ideas, is invariably
    the signal for its rejection: &quot;not that, not that.&quot;</p>

    <p>One might simplify this explanation by constructing some sort of
    apophthegm; Magick is the journey from 0 to 2, Yoga from 2 to 0.&nbsp; It
    is a very good rule for the Yogi to keep this mind constantly fixed on
    the fact that any idea soever is false.&nbsp; There is actually a Hindu
    proverb &quot;That which can be thought is not true.&quot;&nbsp; Consequently 
    the existence of any idea in the mind is an immediate refutation of it,
    but equally the contraries as well as contradictory of that idea are
    false, and the result of this is to knock the second law of formal logic
    to pieces.<!-- insert note re this --></p>

    <p>One puts up a sort of sorites&mdash;A is B, therefore A is not B; therefore
    not A is not B; and all these contrary statements are equally false,
    but in order to realise this fact they must themselves be announced by
    the mind as ecstatic discoveries of truth.</p>

    <p>The result of all this naturally is that the mind very rapidly becomes
    a discredited instrument, and one attains to a totally different and
    much more exalted type of mind, and the same destructive criticism
    which one applied to the original consciousness applies equally to
    this higher consciousness, and one gets to one higher still which is
    again destroyed.  In <em>The Equinox</em>, Vol. I there is an essay called 
    &quot;The Soldier and the Hunchback: ! and ?&quot;</a>&nbsp; 
    In <em>Liber Aleph</em> too there are several chapters about attainment by what is 
    called the Method of Ladders.<a href="#2">2</a></p>

    <p>All these operations are equally valid and equally invalid, and the
    result of this is that the whole subject of Yoga leads to constantly
    increasing confusion.&nbsp; The fineness of the analytical instrument seems
    to defeat its own purpose and it is perhaps because of that confession
    that I have always felt in my deepest consciousness that the method of
    Magick is on the whole less dangerous than that of Yoga.&nbsp; This is 
    particularly the case when discussing these matters with a Western mind.</p>
   
    <p>It is true that our 0 = 2 formula remains infinitely useful because it
    is of such potency in destroying the scepticism which so often disheartens 
    one, especially in the highest realms of &nbsp; The criticism
    which the enemy directs against your sun-kissed tower is thrown back
    from those glittering walls.&nbsp; You accept the criticism at the same time
    as you dismiss it with a laugh.</p>

    <p>On the whole therefore I continue to regard the discipline of Yoga as
    its most valuable feature.&nbsp; The results attained by pushing Yoga to its
    end are on their own showing worthless, whereas the attainment of Magick,
    however lofty, is still immune to all criticism and at every period of
    its construction has been perfectly sympathetic with the normal consciousness of man.</p>

    <p>On this view indeed, one might laughingly remark that Yoga at its best
    is a smoke-screen thrown out by a battleship in self-protection.</p>

    <p>It may seem to you strange as you read this letter to have watched how
    the pendulum has swung always a little more and more towards the side
    of Magick.&nbsp; I do not know why this should have been, but that it is so
    I have no doubt whatever.&nbsp; I see quite clearly now that Yoga from its
    very first beginnings is liable to lead the mind away into a condition
    of muddle, and though for each such state Yoga itself provides the
    necessary cure, may not one ask oneself if it is really wise to begin
    one's work with axioms and postulates which are inherently dangerous.&nbsp;
    The whole controversy might be expressed as a differential equation.&nbsp;
    Their curves become identical only at infinity, and there is no doubt,
    at least to my mind, that the curve of Magick follows a more pleasant
    track than that of Yoga.</p>

    <p>To take one point alone: it is evidently more satisfactory to have
    one's malignant demons external to oneself.</p>

    <p>As I have written it has become clearer to me that this is the case,
    but I should not like you to arise from its perusal with any idea that
    I have been in some way derogating Yoga&nbsp;  I would not like to maintain
    that it is necessary to Magick because there have been many very great
    magicians who knew nothing at all of the subject but I am just as
    strongly convinced as I was before that the practice of Yoga in itself
    is of enormous assistance to the Magician in his more intelligible
    path, only adding that he should beware lest the logical antinomies
    inherent in Yoga divert him from or discourage him in his simple path.</p>
