    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXIII: Improvising a Temple</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>


    <p>(This letter has been provoked by points discussed in your recent visit.)</p>

    <p>As some of your daily practices are ceremonial, it should not come amiss
    to vouchsafe a few hints of practical service.&nbsp; For in ritual Magick, it
    will of course be the first care to get everything balanced and <em>tidy</em>.</p>

    <p>If you propose to erect a regular Temple, the most precise instructions in every 
    detail are given in <em>Book 4</em>, Part II.&nbsp; (But I haven't so much as seen 
    a copy for years!)&nbsp; There is a good deal scattered about in Part III 
    (<em>Magick</em>, which you have) especially about the four elemental weapons.</p>

    <p>But if circumstances deny you for the moment the means of carrying out
    this &AElig;dification as the Ideal would have it, you can certainly do your
    best to create a fairly satisfactory&mdash;above all, workable&mdash;substitute.</p>

    <p>(By the way, note the moral aspect of a house, as displayed in our language.
    &quot;Edification&quot;&mdash;&quot;house-making&quot;: from Latin <em>Aedes</em>, 
    &quot;house&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;Economy&quot;&mdash;&quot;house-ruling&quot;: 
    from the Greek &quot;&Omicron;&Iota;&Kappa;&Omicron;&Sigma;&quot;, &quot;House&quot; 
    and &quot;&Nu;&Omicron;&Mu;&Omicron;&Sigma;&quot;, &quot;law.&quot;)</p>

    <p>I was often reduced to such expedients when wandering in strange lands,
    camping on glaciers, and so on.&nbsp; I fixed it workably well.&nbsp; In Mexico,
    D.F. for instance, I took my bedroom itself for the Circle, my night-table for 
    the Altar, my candle for the Lamp; and I made the Weapons compact.&nbsp; I had 
    a Wand eight inches long, all precious stones and enamel, to represent the Tree 
    of Life; within, an iron tube containing quicksilver&mdash;very correct, lordly, 
    and damsilly.&nbsp; What a club!&nbsp; Also, bought, a silver-gilt Cup; for Air 
    and Earth I made one sachet of rose-petals in yellow silk, and another in green 
    silk packed with salt.&nbsp; In the wilds it was easy, agreeable and most 
    efficacious to make a Circle, and build an altar, of stones; my Alpine Lantern 
    served admirably for the Lamp.&nbsp; It did double duty when required: e.g. in 
    partaking of the Sacrament of the Four Elements, it served for Fire.&nbsp; 
    But your conditions are not so restricted as this.</p>

    <p>Let us consider what one can do with an ordinary house, such as you are
    happy enough to possess.</p>

    <p>First of all, it is of immense advantage to have a room specially consecrated 
    to the Work, never used for any other purpose, and never entered by any other 
    person than yourself, unless it were another Initiate, either for inspection 
    or in case you were working together.</p>

    <p>The aura accumulates with the regularity and frequency of Use.</p>

    <p>The first point is the Banishing:  Everything is to be removed from the
    room which is not absolutely necessary to the Work.</p>

    <p>In this country, one must attend to the heating.&nbsp; An electric stove in
    the East or the South, is best: it must not need attention.&nbsp; One can
    usually buy stoves with excellent appropriate symbolism.&nbsp; (Last time I
    did this&mdash;13 e.v.&mdash;I got a perfect Ferranti at Harrods.&nbsp; The 
    circular copper bowl, with the central Disk as the source of heat, is 
    unsurpassable.)&nbsp; The walls should be &quot;self-coloured,&quot; a neutral 
    tint&mdash;green, grey or blue-grey? and entirely bare, unless you put up, in the 
    proper quarters, the proper designs, such as the &quot;Watch Towers&quot;&mdash;see 
    <em>The Equinox</em> I, 7.<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p>Remember that your &quot;East,&quot; your Kiblah, is Boleskine House, which is as
    near as possible due North from Plymouth.&nbsp; Find North by the shadow of
    a vertical rod and noon, or by the Pole-Star.&nbsp; Work out the angle as usual.</p>

    <p>The St&eacute;l&eacute; of Revealing</a> may be just on the N. 
    Wall to make your &quot;East.&quot;</p>

    <p>Next, your Circle.&nbsp; The floor ought to be &quot;Earth&quot; green; but white 
    will serve, or black.&nbsp; (A Masonic carpet is not at all bad.)  The Circle itself 
    should be as shown in &quot;Book 4&quot;, Part II; but as this volume is probably 
    unavailable, ask me to show you the large painted diagram in my portfolio when next 
    you visit me, and we can arrange for it to be copied.</p>

    <p>This should then be painted in the correct colours on the floor: the
    Kether Square to the North, your &quot;East.&quot;</p>

    <p>The Altar must fit exactly the square of Tiphareth; it is best made as
    a cupboard; of oak or acacia, by preference.&nbsp; It can then be used to hold
    reserves of incense and other requisites.</p>

    <p>Note that the height of the Altar has to suit your convenience.&nbsp; It is
    consequently in direct relation with your own stature; in proportion,
    it is a double cube.&nbsp; This then determines the size of your circle; in
    fact the entire apparatus and furniture is a geometrical function of
    yourself.&nbsp; Consider it all as a projection of yourself in terms of these
    conventional formulae.&nbsp; (A convention does really mean "that which is
    convenient.&quot;&nbsp; How abject, then to obey a self-styled convention which
    is actually as inconvenient as possible!)<a href="#2">2</a></p>

    <p>Next, the Lamp.&nbsp; This may be of silver, or silver-gilt, (to represent
    the Path of Gimel) and is to be hung from the ceiling exactly above the
    centre of the altar. There are plenty of old church lamps which serve
    very well.&nbsp; The light is to be from a wick in a floating cork in a glass
    of olive oil.&nbsp; (I hope you can get it!)&nbsp; It is really desirable to make
    this as near the &quot;Ever-burning Lamp of the Rosicrucians&quot; as possible;
    it is <em>not</em> a drawback that this implies frequent attention.</p>

    <p>Now for the Weapons!</p>

    <p><em>The Wand</em>.&nbsp; Let this be simple, straight and slim!&nbsp; Have you an 
    Almond or Witch Hazel in your garden&mdash;or do I call it park?  If so, cut (with 
    the magick knife&mdash;I would lend you mine) a bough, as nearly straight as
    possible, about two feet long.&nbsp; Peel it, rub it constantly with Oil of
    Abramelin (this, and his incense, from Wallis and Co., 26 New Cavendish
    Street, W.1) and keep wrapped in scarlet silk, constantly, I wrote, and
    meant it; rub it, when saying your mantra, to the rhythm of that same.&nbsp;
    (Remember, &quot;A ka dua&quot; is the best; ask me to intone it to you when you
    next visit me.)</p>

    <p><em>The Cup</em>.&nbsp; There are plenty of chalices to be bought.&nbsp; It should be of
    silver.  If ornamented, the best form is that of the apple.&nbsp; I have seen
    suitable cups in many shops.</p>

    <p><em>The Sword</em>.&nbsp; The ideal form is shown in the Ace of Swords in the Tarot.</p>

    <p>At all events, let the blade be straight, and the hilt a simple cross.
    (The 32&deg; Masonic Sword is not too bad; Kenning or Spencer in Great Queen
    Street, W.C.2 stock them&mdash;or used to do.)</p>

    <em>The Disk</em>.&nbsp; This ought to be of pure gold, with your own Pantacle, designed
    by yourself after prolonged study, graved thereupon.&nbsp; While getting ready
    for this any plain circle of gold will have to serve your turn.&nbsp; Quite
    flat, of course.&nbsp; If you want a good simple design to go on <em>interim</em>, try
    the Rosy Cross or the Unicursal Hexagram.

    <p>So much for the Weapons!&nbsp; Now, as to your personal accoutrements, Robe,
    Lamen, Sandals and the like, The Book of the Law</a> has 
    most thoughtfully simplified matters for us.&nbsp; &quot;I charge you earnestly to 
    come before me in a single robe, and covered with a rich headdress.&quot;&nbsp; 
    (AL I, 61)&nbsp; The Robe may well be in the form of the Tau Cross; i.e. expanding 
    from axilla to ankle, and from shoulder to&mdash;whatever you call the place where your 
    hands come out.&nbsp; (Shape well shown in the illustration <em>Magick</em> face p. 360).
    You being a Probationer, plain black is correct;<a href="#3">3</a>
    and the Unicursal Hexagram might be embroidered, or &quot;applique&quot; 
    (is it? I mean &quot;stuck on&quot;), upon the breast.&nbsp; The best head-dress is 
    the Nemyss: I cannot trust myself to describe how to make one, but there are any 
    number of models in the British Museum, on in any Illustrated Hieroglyphic text.&nbsp; 
    The Sphinx wears one, and there is a photograph, showing the shape and structure very 
    clearly, in the <em>Equinox</em> I, 1, frontispiece to Supplement.&nbsp; You can easily 
    make one yourself out of silk; broad black-and-white stripes is a pleasing design.&nbsp;
    Avoid &quot;artistic&quot; complexities.</p>

    <p>Well, that ought to be enough to keep you out of mischief for a little
    while; but I feel moved to add a line of caution and encouragement.</p>
    <blockquote>
      Listen!<br>
      Faites attention!<br>
      Achtung!<br>
      Khabardar karo!
    </blockquote>
    <p>Just as soon as you start seriously to prepare a place for magical Work,
    the world goes more cockeyed than it is already.&nbsp; Don't be surprised if
    you find that six weeks' intense shopping all over London fails to provide
    you with some simple requisite that normally you could buy in ten minutes.&nbsp;
    Perhaps your fires simply refuse to burn, even when liberally dosed with
    petrol and phosphorus, with a handful of Chlorate of Potash thrown in just
    to show there is no ill feeling!&nbsp; When you have almost decided that you
    had better make up your mind to do without something that seems really
    quite unobtainable&mdash;say, a sixty-carat diamond which <em>would</em> look so well
    on the head-dress&mdash;a perfect stranger comes along and makes you a present
    of one.&nbsp; Or, a long series of quite unreasonable obstacles or silly accidents 
    interfere with your plans: or, the worst difficulty in your way is incomprehensibly 
    removed by some extraordinary &quot;freak of chance.&quot;&nbsp; Or,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

    <p>In a word, you seem to have strolled into a world where&mdash;well, it might
    be going too far to say that the Law of Cause and Effect is suspended;
    but at least the Law of Probability seems to be playing practical jokes
    on you.</p>

    <p>This means that your manoeuvres have  somehow attracted the notice of the
    Astral Plane: your new neighbours (May I call them?) are taking an
    interest in the latest Tenderfoot, some to welcome, to do all they can
    to help you to settle down, others indignant or apprehensive at this
    disturbance of routine.&nbsp; This is where your Banishings and Invocations
    come to the rescue.&nbsp; Of course, I am not here referring to the approach
    to Sanctuaries which of necessity are closely guarded, but merely to the
    recognition of a new-comer to that part of the world in general.</p>

    <p>Of course all these miracles are very naughty of you; they mean that your
    magical power has sprung a few small leaks; at least, the water is oozing
    between some planks not sealed as Hermetically as they should be.&nbsp; But oh
    and this is naughtier still&mdash;it is a blessed, blessed comfort that they
    happen, that chance, coincidence and all the rest will simply <em>not</em> explain
    it all away, that your new vision of life is not a dream, but part and
    parcel of Experience for evermore, a real as any other manifestation of
    Reality through sense such as is common to all men.</p>

    <p>And this brings us&mdash;it has been a long way round&mdash;from the suggestion of
    your visit to the question (hitherto unanswered) in your letter.</p>

    <p>You raise so vast and razor-edged a question when you write of the supposed
    antinomy of &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;sense&quot; that it seemed better to withhold 
    comment until this later letter; much meditation was most needful to compress
    the answer within reasonable limits; even to give it form at all is no
    easy matter.&nbsp; For this is probably the symptom of the earliest stirring of
    the mind of the cave-man to reflection, thereunto moved by other symptoms&mdash;those 
    of the morning after following upon the night before.&nbsp; It is&mdash;have
    we not already dealt with that matter after a fashion?&mdash;evidence of disease
    when an organ become aware of its own modes of motion.&nbsp; Certainly the mere
    fact of questioning Life bears witness to some interruption of its flow,
    just as a ripple on an even stream tells of a rock submerged.&nbsp; The fiercer
    the torrent and the bigger the obstacle, the greater the disturbance to
    the surface&mdash;have I not seen them in the Bralduh eight feet high?
    Lethargic folk with no wild impulse of Will may get through Life in bovine
    apathy; we may well note that (in a sense) the rage of the water seems to
    our perturbed imagining actually to increase and multiply the obstructions;
    there is a critical point beyond which the ripples fight each other!</p>

    <p>That, in short, is a picture of you!</p>

    <p>You have mistaken the flurry of passing over some actual snag for a snag
    in itself!&nbsp; You put the blame on to your own quite rational attempts to
    overcome difficulties.&nbsp; The secret of the trick of getting past the rocks
    is elasticity; yet it is that very quality with which you reproach yourself!</p>

    <p>We even, at the worst, reach the state for which Buddhism, in the East
    presents most ably the case: as in the West, does James Thomson (B.V.) in
    <em>The City of Dreadful Night</em>; we come to wish for&mdash;or, more truly to
    <em>think</em> that we wish for &quot;blest Nirvana's sinless stainless Peace&quot; 
    (or some such twaddle&mdash;thank God I can't recall Arnold's mawkish and unmanly
    phrase!) and B.V.'s &quot;Dateless oblivion and divine repose.&quot;</p>

    <p>I insist on the &quot;think that you wish,&quot; because, if the real You did 
    really wish the real That, you could never have come to exist at all! (&quot;But I
    don't exist.&quot;&mdash;&quot;I know&mdash;let's get on!&quot;)</p>

    <p>Note, please, how sophistically unconvincing are the Buddhist theories of
    how we ever got into this mess.&nbsp; First cause: Ignorance.&nbsp; Way out, 
    then, knowledge.&nbsp; O.K., that implies a knower, a thing known&mdash;and so on 
    and so forth, thought all the Three Waste Paper Baskets of the Law; analysed, it
    turns out to be nonsense all dolled up to look like thinking.&nbsp; And there
    is no genuine explanation of the origin of the Will to be.</p>

    <p>How different, how simple, how self-evident, is the doctrine of <em>The Book of the Law</em>!</p>

    <p>There are any number of passages dealing with this matter in my writings:
    let's forget them, and keep to the Text!</p>

    <p>Cap. I, v. 26 &quot;. . my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of
    existence, the omnipresence of my body.&quot;</p>

    <p>V. 30&nbsp; &quot;This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is
    as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.&quot;&nbsp; (There is a Qabalistic inner
    meaning in this text; &quot;the pain,&quot; for instance, &Omicron; 
    &Alpha;&Lambda;&Gamma;&Omicron;&Sigma;, may be read XVII &times; 22 &quot;the expression 
    of Star-love,&quot; and so on: all too complicated for this time and place!)</p>

    <p>V. 32. &quot;Then the joys of my love&quot; (<em>i.e</em>. the fulfillment of all possible
    experiences) &quot;will redeem ye from all pain.&quot;</p>

    <p>V. 58. &quot;I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while
    in life, upon death; peace<a href="#ac1">*</a> unutterable, rest, ecstasy; . . .&quot;</p>

    <p>Cap. II, v. 9 &quot;Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the
    sorrows are but as shadows; they pass &amp; are done; but there is that
    which remains.&quot;</p>

    <p>(The continuation is amusing! vv. 10 and 11 read:</p>
    <blockquote>
      O prophet! thou hast ill will to learn this writing.&nbsp; I see thee hate
      the hand &amp; the pen; but I am stronger.
    </blockquote>

    <p>At that time I was a hard-shell Buddhist, sent out a New Year's Card
    &quot;wishing you a speedy termination of existence!&quot;&nbsp; And 
    this as a young man, with the world at my feet.&nbsp; It only goes to 
    show . . . . .)</p>

    <p>Vv. 19, 20. &quot;Is a God to live in a dog?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; but the highest are 
    of us. . . . Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and
    fire, are of us.&quot;</p>

    <p>This chapter returns over and over again to this theme in one form or another.</p>

    <p>What is really more significant is the hidden, the unexpressed, soul of
    the Book; the way in which it leaps into wild spate of rhapsody on any
    excuse or no excuse.</p>

    <p>This is surely more convincing than some dreary thesis plodding along doggedly 
    with the &quot;proof&quot; (!) that &quot;God is good,&quot; every sentence creaking
    with your chalk-stones and squeaking with the twinges of your toe!</p>

    <p>Yet just because I proclaim a doctrine of joy in the language of joy,
    people&mdash;dull camels&mdash;say I am not &quot;serious.&quot;</p>

    <p>Yet I <em>have</em> found pleasure in harnessing the winged horses of the Sun to
    the ploughshare of Reason, in showing the validity of this doctrine in
    detail.&nbsp; It satisfies my sense of rhythm and of symmetry to explain that
    every experience, no matter what, must of necessity be a gain of grandeur,
    of grip, of comprehension and enjoyment ever growing as complexity and
    simplicity succeed each other in sublime systole and diastole, in strophe
    and antistrophe chanting against each other to the stars of the Night and
    of the Morning!</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1">><b>*</b> &quot;Peace&quot;: the glow of satisfaction at achievement.&nbsp; It is not 
    &quot;eternal,&quot; rather, it whets the appetite for another adventure.  (Peace, &Eta; 
    &Epsilon;&Iota;&Rho;&Eta;&Nu;&Eta; = 189 = 7 &times; 9 &times; 3, the Venusian plus Lunar 
    form of Unity.)<a href="#4">4</a></p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>Of course it is easy as pie to knock all this to pieces by &quot;lunatic logic,&quot;
    saying: &quot;Then toothache is really as pleasant as strawberry shortcake:&quot;&nbsp;
    You are hereby referred to <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em>.&nbsp; None of the terms I
    am using have been, or can be defined.&nbsp; All my propositions amount to no
    more than tautology: A. is A.&nbsp; You may even quote <em>The Book of the Law</em>
    itself: &quot;Now a curse upon Because and his kin! . . . . Enough of Because!
    Be he damned for a dog!&quot;&nbsp; (AL II, 28-33</a>).&nbsp; 
    These things stink of Ignoratio Elenchi, or something painfully like it: as sort of slipping 
    up a cog, of &quot;confusing the planes&quot; of willfully misunderstanding the gist of
    an argument.&nbsp; (All magicians, by the way, ought to be grounded solidly in Formal Logic.)</p>

    <p>Never forget, at the least, how simple it is to make a maniac's hell-broth
    of any proposition, however plain to common sense.</p>

    <p>All the above, now:&mdash;Buddhism refuted.&nbsp; Yet it is a possibility and
    therefore one facet of Truth.&nbsp; &quot;Rest&quot; is an idea: so immobility is one
    of the moving states.&nbsp; A certain state of mind is (almost by definition)
    &quot;eternal,&quot; yet it most assuredly begins and ends.</p>

    <p>And so on for ever&mdash;I fear it would be nugatory, pleonastic (and oh!
    several other lovely long adjectives!) to try to guard you from these
    hydra-headed and protean booby-traps; you must tackle them yourself as
    they arise, and deal with them as best you can: always remembering that
    often enough you cannot tell which is you and which is the Monkey Puzzle,
    or who has won.&nbsp; (&quot;Everybody's won; so everybody must have a prize&quot;
    applies beautifully).&nbsp; And none of it all matters a row of haricots verts
    saut&eacute;s; for the conclusion must always be Doubt (see that beastly <em>Book of Lies</em>
    again&mdash;there's a gorgeous chapter about it<a href="#6">6</a>) 
    and the practical moral is this: these contradictions don't occur (or don't matter) 
    in Neschamah.</p>

    <p>Also, it might help you quite a lot (by encouraging you when depressed, or
    amusing you when you want to relax) to read <em>Sir Palamede the Saracen</em>;
    Supplement to <em>The Equinox</em>, Vol. I, No. 4.&nbsp; I expect quite a few of his
    tragi-comic misadventures will be already familiar to you in one disguise
    or another.</p>

    <p>And if the above remarks should embolden you to exclaim: &quot;Perhaps a little
    drink would do me no great harm&quot; I shall feel that I have deserved well of
    my country!</p>

    <p>For&mdash;see <em>Liber Aleph</em>, after Rabelais&mdash;the Word of the Last Oracle is
    TRINC.<a href="#5">5</a></p>

    <p>This plaint of yours tails off&mdash;and perks up in so doing&mdash;with confession
    of Ambition, and considerations of what you must leave over to your next
    life.&nbsp; Very right! but all that is covered by your general programme.&nbsp; It
    is proper to assimilate these ideas with the fundamental structure of your
    mind: &quot;Perhaps I had better leave 'The Life and opinion of Battling Bill,
    the Ballarat Bruiser' till, shall we say, six incarnations ahead&quot;&mdash;But
    perhaps you have acquired that already.</p>

    <p>No, better still, concentrate on the Next Step!  After all, it is the only
    one you can take, isn't it!  Without lust of result, please!</p>

    <p>And I shall leave anything else to the next letter.</p>

    <p>P.S. &quot;Next letter,&quot; yes, they are running into one another more than somewhat; 
    it is better so, for life is like that.&nbsp; And we have the bold bad editor to 
    sort them out.</p>
        
    <hr>
    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: The reference is to Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh</a>, 
    otherwise known as &quot;A brief abstract of the symbolic representation of the Universe as 
    derived by Dr. John Dee from the skrying of Sir Edward Kelly.&quot;</p>
    <p id="2"><b>2</b>: The Circle described in <em>Book 4</em> part II has an overall diameter of 
    about 17 times the side of each square comprising the Tau (this assumes the distance between 
    the inner and outer circle is about the same as the side of each square).&nbsp; The double 
    cube altar is traditionally 44 inches high (about navel height on a six foot person) which will 
    make the circle over 30 feet in diameter.&nbsp; This might be possible if you have the use of 
    a small sports hall; it will not fit in most peoples' living rooms &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="3"><b>3</b>: The robe of a Probationer, as can be deduced from photographs of the Rites 
    of Eleusis and references in <em>The Vision and the Voice</em> and other writings of the <em>Equinox</em> 
    period, was originally conceieved of as white with no hood, a pentagram on the breast and the 
    &quot;Hexagram of Nature&quot; (red triangle ascending, blue triangle descending, golden Tau in the 
    centre) on the back &ndash; T.S.</p>
