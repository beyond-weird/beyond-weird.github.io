    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LVI: Marriage&mdash;Property&mdash;War&mdash;Politics</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>


    <p>Directly or indirectly, you have already all you need about marriage in
    its relation to Magical Traning.  The Hindu proverb sums it all up:
    &quot;There are seven kinds of wife&mdash;like a mother, a sister, a daughter, a
    mistress, a friend, an enemy and a slave; of these the only good one
    is the last.&quot;</p>

    <p>But from your questions I gather that what you want is advice on how to
    advise, how marriage as an institution is regarded by The Book of the
    Law</a>.&nbsp; Very good.</p>

    <p>It is not actually mentioned; but that it is contemplated is shown by
    the use of the word &quot;wife&quot;&mdash;AL I, 41</a>.&nbsp; 
    The text confirms my own thesis &quot;There shall be no property in human flesh.&quot;&nbsp; 
    So long as this is observed I see no reason why two or more people should not find it convenient 
    to make a contract according to the laws of customs of their community.</p>

    <p>But my above thesis is all important; note the fury of denunciation in
    AL I, 41-42</a>!</p>

    <p>As to property in general, the Book lays down no law.&nbsp; So far as one can
    see, it seems to adhere to &quot;the good old rule, the simple plan that they
    should take who have the power, and they should keep who can.&quot;</p>

    <p>I think that your best course is to work out all such problems for yourself; 
    at least it is an admirable if arduous, mental exercise.&nbsp; One ought, theoretically, 
    to be able to deduce the ideal system from the Magical Formula of the Aeon of Horus.</p>

    <p>Now then, as to war.&nbsp; You need hardly have asked the question; the
    whole Book is alive with it; it thrills, it throbs, it tingles on
    almost every page.&nbsp; It even goes into details. Strategy: &quot;Lurk!&nbsp; Withdraw!&nbsp; 
    Upon them! ...&quot; AL III, 9</a>.&nbsp; 
    Then AL III, 3 - 8</a>.&nbsp; England, I suppose.&nbsp;
    Verse 6</a> suggests the mine-layer to any one who has seen one in 
    action.&nbsp; Verse 7</a> might refer to the tank or the 
    aeroplane&mdash;or to something we haven't yet got.</p>

    <p>Notice also Verse 28</a>, a surprising conclusion to the long 
    magical instruction about the &quot;Cakes of Light.&quot;&nbsp; Then the mysterious opening of
    Verse 46</a> demands attention and research!&nbsp; Can 
    &quot;...the Forties:...&quot; refer to the years '39 (e.v.) onward&mdash;will this war last 
    till '49 (e.v.)?&nbsp; Can the &quot;...Eighties...&quot; be symbolic, as the decade in which 
    universal peace seemed to nearly everybody as assured for an indefinite period?</p>

    <p>There are any number of other passages, equally warlike; but see II, 24</a>.&nbsp;
    It is a warning against internecine conflict between the masters; see also 
    III 58,59</a>.&nbsp; Hitler might well quote 
    these two reminders that the real danger is the revolt of the slave classes.&nbsp; 
    They cannot rule or build; no sooner do they find themselves in a crisis than mephitic
    rubbish about democracy is swept into the dustbin by a Napoleon or a Stalin.</p>

    <p>There is just one exception to the general idea of ruthlessness; some shadowy vision 
    of a chivalrous type of warfare is granted to us in AL III, 59:&nbsp; Significant, 
    perhaps, that this and a restatement of Thelema came immediately before &quot;There is 
    an end of the word of the God enthroned in Ra's seat, lightening the girders of the 
    soul.&quot;&nbsp; (AL III, 61)  And this is &quot;As brothers fight ye!&quot;&nbsp; 
    Perhaps the Aeon may give birth to some type of warfare &quot;under Queensbery 
    rules&quot; so to say.&nbsp; A baptism of those who assert their right to belong to 
    the Master class.&nbsp; Something, in short, not wholly dissimilar from the jousts of 
    Feudal times.&nbsp; But on such points I should not care to adventure any very
    positive opinion.</p>

    <p>The last part of your question refers to politics.&nbsp; &quot;The word politics
    surprises by himself,&quot; as Count Smorltork observed.&nbsp; Practically all
    those parts of the Book which deal with social matters may be considered
    as political in the old an proper sense of the word; of modern politics
    it disdains to speak.</p>
