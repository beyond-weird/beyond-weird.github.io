    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXIV: Magical Power</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Rightly you remark that most of these letters have dealt with self-development 
    in one form or another; now, what of the &quot;<em>causa finalis</em>&quot;,<a href="#1">1</a>
    the &quot;practical angle&quot; some would call it.&nbsp; Are the outrageous quack
    advertisements of the swindlers with their &quot;Great Free Book&quot; and so on,
    all baseless?&nbsp; My dear child, then back to those letters that gave you
    a glimpse of the History of Magick, and those in which I told you something 
    of the ways in which the Masters work.&nbsp; Oh, I see!&nbsp; What you want
    now is to learn how to apply the knowledge and power that you have
    gained to the execution of your True Will, to accomplishment of the
    Great Work.</p>

    <p>Obviously, much must be left to your own common-sense; the one technical
    point on which I insist above all others is the Magical Link.</p>

    <p>You must lay to heart <em>Magick</em> Chapter XIV (pp. 106-122) and never forget
    one detail.&nbsp; More failure comes from neglect of this than from all other
    causes put together.&nbsp; Most of the qualities that you need are inborn;
    all the material is to your hand; and to develop them is a natural
    process, equally your birthright.&nbsp; But the making of the Link is an
    intellectual, even mechanical, task; success depends on purely objective 
    considerations.</p>

    <p>That granted, there are perhaps a few hints.&nbsp; Firstly, while of course
    the Magical Theory supposes a kind of omnipotence, please remember that
    Magick <em>is</em> Science, that the Laws of Nature remain the same, however
    subtle may be the material with which one is working.&nbsp; It is, to put it
    brutally, a bigger miracle to destroy a fortress than an easy chair.</p>

    <p>You know this well enough; but the corollary is that it is nearly always
    a mistake to try to do things entirely off one's own bat.&nbsp; It is much
    simpler to look for an existing force, in good working order, that is
    doing the sort of stuff that you need, and take from it, or control in
    it, just that bit of it that you happen to require.</p>

    <p>You can, theoretically, walk from Cadiz to Vladivostock; but unless
    there be some special reason, it will save time and waste of energy to
    make use of a fraction of the machine-power that happens to be moving
    in that direction.</p>

    <p>This is particularly true of moral and political reform.&nbsp; Hitler would
    have got exactly nowhere if he had been content to announce his evangel;
    he became master of Germany, and, for a time, of nearly all Europe, by
    playing upon existing instruments of human passion; the revenge-lust
    of Central Europe, the panic of the Blimps and Junkers, the discontent
    of the property-lacking classes, the pride and ambition of the Prussian
    military clique, and so on.&nbsp; When he had used them to the full, he
    callously flung them to the wolves.&nbsp; But make no mistake!&nbsp; The Magical
    Power behind all his actions lay in himself.&nbsp; He had succeeded in
    making himself a prophet, like Mohammed; even a symbol, like the Cross
    of the &nbsp; His magical technique was indescribably admirable;
    he adopted the Swastika, the Hammer of Thor, the distinctive dress,
    the slogan, the gestures, the greeting; he even imposed a Sacred Book
    upon the people.&nbsp; If that book had only been more mystic and incomprehensible, 
    instead of reasonable, diffuse, and intolerably dull, he might have done 
    better.&nbsp; As it was, he came within an ace of capturing England, even 
    before he came to power in Germany; and it was American money that saved 
    the Nazi party at the most critical moment.&nbsp; Cleverest move of all, 
    he gave the world something to hate; the Communist and the Jew.</p>

    <p>His only trouble was that he couldn't count on his fingers!&nbsp; I perceive 
    that I am turning into the late Samuel Smiles; having given you an example to 
    imitate&mdash;but don't forget your arithmetic!&mdash;let me initiate you into 
    one of two other secrets of power!</p>

    <p>Um&mdash;will I now?&nbsp; Perhaps you're hardly grown up enough.&nbsp; I 
    suspect that your question contemplated not so much Power as powers: things
    like healing the sick, making oneself invisible, kindling a flame with-
    out combustibles, bewitching the neighbours' cows, spoiling your friend's
    honeymoon, fascinations of all kinds, levitation, lycanthropy, necromancy,
    all the regular stuff of the legends and the fables.</p>

    <p>Most of these matters are discussed in <em>Magick</em>, so all I need tell
    you is the correct general attitude to all such thaumaturgies.</p>

    <p>The best excuse for trying to acquire them is that one learns such a
    lot in the process.&nbsp; Otherwise&mdash;</p>

    <p>Here is another of those Eastern stories for you!&nbsp; A certain Yogi thought
    it would be an admirable achievement to walk across the Ganges.&nbsp; After
    forty years he succeeded, and went off to his Guru to demonstrate his
    power, and receive his due meed of praise.&nbsp; It so happened that this
    Guru was rather like myself, at least in he matter of his Nasty Temper;
    and when the disciple came gaily striding back across the Sacred Stream,
    expecting compliments, he was met with: &quot;Well, I think you're a perfect
    fool all these years, your neighbours have been going to and fro on a
    raft for a couple of pice!&quot;</p>

    <p>The moral, dear child, is that such powers are never to be considered
    as the main object; it ought in fact to be obvious from the start that
    any one's True Will must be deeper and more comprehensive than any mere
    technical achievement.&nbsp; I will go further and say that any such endeavour 
    must be a magical mistake, like cherishing a gun or a clock or a
    fishing-rod for its own sake, and not for the use that one can make of
    it.&nbsp; Indeed, that remark goes to the root of the matter; for all these
    powers, if we understand them properly, are natural by-products of one's
    real Great Work.&nbsp; My own experience was very convincing on this point;
    for one power after another came popping up when it was least wanted,
    and I saw at once that they represented so many leaks in my boat.&nbsp; They
    argued imperfect insulation.</p>

    <p>And really they are quite a bit of a nuisance.&nbsp; Their possession is so
    flattering, and their seduction so subtle.&nbsp; One understands at once
    why all the first-class Teachers insist so sternly that the Siddhi (or
    Iddhi) must be rejected firmly by the Aspirant, if he is not to be sidetracked 
    and ultimately lost.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, &quot;even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful
    and good&quot; as Zoroaster reminds us.<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp;
    For one thing, their possession is indubitably a sheet-anchor, at the 
    mercy of the hurricane of Doubt&mdash; doubt as to whether the whole 
    business is not Tommy-rot!</p>

    <p>Such moments are frequent, even when one has advanced to a stage when
    Doubt would seem impossible; until you get there, you can have no idea
    how bad it is!</p>

    <p>Then, again, when these powers have sprung naturally and spontaneously
    from the exercise of one's proper faculties in the Great Work, they
    ought to be a little more than leaks.&nbsp; You ought to be able to organize
    and control them in such wise that they are of actual assistance to you
    in taking the Next Step.&nbsp; After all, what moral or magical difference
    is there between the power of digesting one's food, and that of transforming 
    oneself into a hawk?</p>

    <p>That being the case, let me transform myself into a butterfly, and flit
    on to other honeysuckles!</p>

    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: <em>Lat.</em>, &quot;final cause.&quot;&nbsp; Aristotelean and 
    medieval philosophy recognised four kinds of &quot;cause&quot; (&alpha;&iota;&tau;&iota;&alpha;):
    material, formal, efficient and final; the &quot;final cause&quot; is the &quot;for the sake of 
    which,&quot; the purpose an intelligent agent has when making or doing something, the end or goal 
    for which a thing exists, and so on &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="2"><b>2</b>: <em>Chald&aelig;an Oracles</em>, fragment 191 in the Westcott edition, where 
    it is rendered &quot;Nature persuadeth us that there are pure D&aelig;mons, and that evil germs 
    of Matter may alike become useful and good.&quot;&nbsp; A modern translation (by Johnston in 
    <em>Hekate Soteira</em>) runs &quot;Physis persuades us to believe that the daemones are pure, and 
    that the products of evil matter are propitious and good.&quot;&nbsp; Johnston (also Lewy in 
    <em>Chald&aelig;an Oracles and Theurgy</em>) interprets this verse in a manner almost 
    diametrically opposed to that of Crowley, arguing that the <em>Oracles</em> have a basically 
    hylophobic perspective and this fragment is rather a warning about the delusiveness of 
    &quot;nature&quot; (&phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;) &ndash; T.S.</p>
