    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter V: The Universe: The 0 = 2 Equation</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Yes, I admit everything!  It is <em>all</em> my fault.&nbsp; Looking over my past writings, 
    I do see that my only one-opointed attempt to set forth a sound ontology was my early 
    fumbling letter brochure Berashith</a>.&nbsp; Since then, I seem 
    to have kept assuming that everybody knew all about it; referring to it, quoting it, but never 
    sitting down seriously to demonstrate the thesis, or even to state it in set terms.&nbsp; 
    Chapter 0 of <em>Magick in Theory and Practice</em> skates gently over it; the &quot;Naples 
    Arrangement&quot; in <em>The Book of Thoth</em> dodges it with really diabolical ingenuity.&nbsp; 
    I ask myself why.&nbsp; It is exceedingly strange, because every time I think of the Equation, 
    I am thrilled with a keen glow of satisfaction that this sempiternal Riddle of the Sphinx 
    should have been answered at last.</p>

    <p>So then let me now give myself the delight, and you the comfort, of stating the 
    problem from its beginning, and proving the soundness of the solution&mdash;of 
    showing that the contradiction of this Equation is <em>unthinkable</em>.&nbsp; &mdash; &mdash; 
    Are you ready?&nbsp; Forward!&nbsp; Paddle!</p>

    <p>A.&nbsp; We are aware.</p>

    <p>B.&nbsp; We cannot doubt the existence (whether &quot;real&quot; or &quot;illusory&quot; 
    makes no difference) of something, because doubt itself is a form of awareness.</p>

    <p>C.&nbsp; We lump together all that of which we are aware under the convenient
    name of &quot;Existence&quot;, or &quot;The Universe&quot;.&nbsp; <em>Cosmos</em> is 
    not so good for this purpose; that word implies &quot;order&quot;, which in the 
    present stage of our argument, is a mere assumption.</p>

    <p>D.&nbsp; We also tend to think of the Universe as containing things of which
    we are not aware; but this is altogether unjustifiable, although it is
    difficult to think at all without making some such assumption.&nbsp; For
    instance, one may come upon a new branch of knowledge&mdash;say, histology
    or Hammurabi or the language of the Iroquois or the poems of the Hermaphrodite 
    of Panormita.&nbsp; It seems to be there all ready waiting for us;
    we simply cannot believe that we are making it all up as we go along.&nbsp; 
    For all that, it is sheer sophistry; we may merely be unfolding the
    contents of our own minds.&nbsp; Then again, does a thing cease to exist if we
    forget it?&nbsp; The answer is that one cannot be sure.</p>

    <p>Personally, I feel convinced of the existence of an Universe outside my
    own immediate awareness; but it is true, even so, that it does not exist
    <em>for me</em> unless and until it takes its place as part of my consciousness.</p>

    <p>E.&nbsp; All this paragrpah D is in the nature of a digression, for what you
    may think of it does not at all touch the argument of this letter.  But
    it had to be put in, just to prevent your mind from raising irrelevant
    objections.&nbsp; Let me continue, then, from C.</p>

    <p>F.&nbsp; Something is.<a href="#ac1">*</a>&nbsp; This something appears 
    incalculably vast and complex.&nbsp; How did it come to be?</p>

    <p>This, briefly, is the "Riddle of the Universe," which has been always the
    first preoccupation of all serious philosophers since men began to think
    at all.</p>

    <p>G.&nbsp; The orthodox idiot answer, usually wrapped up in obscure terms in the
    hope of concealing from the enquirer the fact that it is not an answer
    at all, but an evasion, is: God created it.</p>

    <p>Then, obviously, who created God?&nbsp; Sometimes we have a Demiurge, a creative
    God behind whom is an eternal formless Greatness&mdash;anything to confuse
    the issue!</p>

    <p>Sometimes the Universe is supported by an elephant; he, in turn, stands
    on a tortoise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by that time it is hoped that the enquirer is too
    tired and muddled to ask what holds up the tortoise.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, a great Father and Mother crystallize out of some huge cloudy
    confusion of &quot;Elements&quot;and so on.&nbsp; But nobody answers the question;
    at least, none of these God-inventing mules, with their incurably commonplace minds.</p>

    <p>H.&nbsp; Serious philosophy has always begun by discarding all these puerilities.&nbsp;
    It has of necessity been divided into these schools: the Nihilist, the Monist, and the Dualist.</p>

    <p>I.&nbsp; The last of these is, on the surface, the most plausible; for almost
    the first thing that we notice on inspecting the Universe is what the
    Hindu schools call &quot;the Pairs of Opposites.&quot;</p>

    <p>This too, is very convenient, because it lends itself so readily to orthodox 
    theology; so we have Ormuzd and Ahriman, the Devas and the Asuras, Osiris and 
    Set, <em>et cetera</em> and <em>da capo</em>, personifications of &quot;Good&quot; and
    &quot;Evil.&quot;&nbsp; The foes may be fairly matched; but more often the tale tells
    of a revolt in heaven.&nbsp; In this case, &quot;Evil&quot; is temporary; soon, especially 
    with the financial help of the devout, the &quot;devil&quot; will be &quot;cast into the 
    Bottomless Pit&quot; and &quot;the Saints will reign with Christ in glory for ever and 
    ever, Amen!&quot;&nbsp; Often a &quot;redeemer,&quot; a &quot;dying God,&quot; is needed
    to secure victory to Omnipotence; and this is usually what little vulgar boys might call 
    a &quot;touching story!&quot;</p>

    <p>J.&nbsp; The Monist (or Advaitist) school, is at once subtler and more refined;
    it seems to approach the <em>ultimate</em> reality (as opposed to the superficial
    examination of the Dualists) more closely.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that this doctrine is based upon a sorites of doubtful validity.&nbsp; 
    To tell you the hideously shameful truth, I hate this doctrine so rabidly that I can 
    hardly trust myself to present it fairly!&nbsp; But I will try.&nbsp; Meanwhile, you 
    can study it in the <em>Upanishads</em>, in the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em>, in Ernst Haeckel's 
    <em>The Riddle of the Universe</em>, and dozens of other classics.&nbsp; The dogma appears 
    to excite its dupes to dithyrambs.&nbsp; I have to admit the &quot;poetry&quot; of the 
    idea; but there is something in me which vehemently rejects it with excruciating and 
    vindictive violence.&nbsp; Possibly, this is because part of our own system runs parallel 
    with the first equations of theirs.</p>

    <p>K.&nbsp; The Monists perceive quite clearly and correctly that it is absurd
    to answer the question &quot;How came these Many things (of which we are aware)
    to be?&quot; by saying that they came from Many; and &quot;Many&quot; in this connection 
    includes Two.&nbsp; The Universe must therefore be a single phenomenon: make it eternal 
    and all the rest of it&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> remove all <em>limit</em> of any
    kind&mdash;and the Universe explains itself.&nbsp; How then can Opposites exist,
    as we observe them to do?&nbsp; Is it not the very essence of our original
    Sorites that the Many must be reducible to the One?&nbsp; They see how awkward 
    this is; so the &quot;devil&quot; of the Dualist is emulsified and evaporated
    into &quot;illusion;&quot; what they call &quot;Maya&quot; or some equivalent term.</p>

    <p>&quot;Reality&quot; for them consists solely of Brahman, the supreme Being &quot;without
    quantity or quality.&quot;&nbsp; They are compelled to deny him all attributes,
    even that of Existence; for to do so would instantly <em>limit</em> them, and so
    hurl them headlong back in to Dualism.&nbsp; All that of which we are aware
    must obviously possess limits, or it could have no intelligible meaning
    for us; if we want &quot;pork,&quot; we must specify its qualities and quantities;
    at the very least, we must be able to distinguish it from &quot;that-which-is-not-pork.&quot;</p>

    <p>But&mdash;one moment, please!</p>

    <p>L.&nbsp; There is in Advaitism a most fascinating danger; that is that, up
    to a certain point, &quot;Religious Experience&quot; tends to support this theory.</p>

    <p>A word on this.&nbsp; Vulgar minds, such as are happy with a personal God,
    Vishnu, Jesus, Melcarth, Mithras, or another, often excite themselves&mdash;call it 
    &quot;Energized Enthusiasm&quot; if you want to be sarcastic!&mdash;to the
    point of experiencing actual Visions of the objects of their devotion.&nbsp;
    But these people have not so much as asked themselves the original question of
    &quot;How come?&quot; which is our present subject.&nbsp; Sweep them into the discard!</p>

    <p>M.&nbsp; Beyond Vishvarupadarshana, the vision of the Form of Vishnu, beyond
    that yet loftier vision which corresponds in Hindu classification to our
    &quot;Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel&quot;, is that called
    Atmadarshana, the vision (<em>or apprehension</em>, a much better word) of the
    Universe as a <em>single</em>_phenomenon, outside all limitations, whether of
    time, space, causality, or what not.</p>

    <p>Very good, then!&nbsp; Here we are with direct realization of the Advaitist
    theory of the Universe.&nbsp; Everything fits perfectly.  Also, when I say
    &quot;realization,&quot; I want you to understand that I mean what I say in a
    sense so intense and so absolute that it is impossible to convey my
    meaning to anyone who has not undergone that experience.<a href="#ac2">&#134;</a></p>

    <p>How do we judge the &quot;reality&quot; of an ordinary impression upon consciousness?&nbsp; 
    Chiefly by its intensity, by its persistence, by the fact that nobody can argue us out of 
    our belief in it.&nbsp; As people said of Berkeley's 'Idealism'&mdash;&quot;his arguments 
    are irrefutable but they fail to carry conviction.&quot;&nbsp; No sceptical, no idealist 
    queries can persuade us that a kick in the pants is not 'real' in any reasonable sense of 
    the word.&nbsp; Moreover memory reassures us.&nbsp; However vivid a dream may be at the time,
    however it may persist throughout the years (though it is rare for any dream, unless frequently 
    repeated, or linked to waking impressions by some happy conjunction of circumstances, to 
    remain long in the mind with any clear-cut vision) it is hardly ever mistaken for an event of 
    actual life.&nbsp; Good: then, as waking life is to dream, so&mdash;yes, more so!&mdash;is
    Religious Experience as above described to that life common to all of us.&nbsp; It is not 
    merely easy, it is natural, not merely natural, but inevitable, for anyone who has experienced 
    &quot;Samadhi&quot; (this word conveniently groups the higher types of vision<a href="#ac3">&#135;</a>) 
    to regard normal life as &quot;illusion&quot; by comparison with this state in which all problems 
    are resolved, all doubts driven out, all limitations abolished.</p>

    <p>But even beyond Atmadarshana comes the experience called Sivadarshana,<a href="#ac4">&sect;</a>
    in which this Atman (or Brahman), this limit-destroying Universe, is itself abolished and annihilated.</p>

    <p>(And, with its occurrence, smash goes the whole of the Advaitist theory!)</p>

    <p>It is a commonplace to say that no words can describe this final destruction.&nbsp;
    Such is the fact; and there is nothing one can do about it but
    put it down boldly as I have done above.&nbsp; It does not matter to our
    present purpose; all that we need to know is that the strongest prop of
    the Monist structure has broken off short.</p>

    <p>Moreover, is it really adequate to postulate an origin of the Universe,
    as they inevitably do?&nbsp; Merely to deny that there ever was a beginning
    by saying that this &quot;one&quot; is eternal fails to satisfy me.</p>

    <p>What is very much worse, I cannot see that to call Evil &quot;illusion&quot; helps
    us at all.&nbsp; When the Christian Scientist hears that his wife has been
    savagely mauled by her Peke, he has to smile, and say that &quot;there is a
    claim of error.&quot;&nbsp; Not good enough.</p>

    <p>N.&nbsp; It has taken a long while to clear the ground.  That I did not
    expect; the above propositions are so familiar to me, they run so
    cleanly through my mind, that, until I came to set them down in order,
    I had no idea what a long and difficult business it all was.</p>

    <p>Still, it's a long lane, etc.&nbsp; We have seen that &quot;Two&quot; (or &quot;Many&quot;) are
    unsatisfactory as origin, if only because they can always be reduced to &quot;One&quot;; 
    and &quot;One&quot; itself is no better, because, among other things, it finds itself forced 
    to deny the very premises on which it was founded.</p>

    <p>Shall we be any better off if we assume that &quot;Ex nihilo nihil fit&quot; is
    a falsehood, that the origin of All Things is Nothing?&nbsp; Let us see!</p>

    <p>O.&nbsp; Shall we first glance at the mathematical aspect of Nothing?&nbsp;
    (Including its identical equation in Logic.)&nbsp; This I worked out so long
    ago as 1902 e.g. in Berashith</a>, which you 
    will find reprinted in The Sword of Song</a>, 
    and in my <em>Collected Works</em>, Vol. I.</p>

    <p>The argument may be summarized as follows.</p>

    <p>When, in the ordinary way of business, we write 0, we should really
    write 0<sup>n</sup>.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp; 
    For 0 implies that the subject is not extended in any dimension under discussion.&nbsp; 
    Thus a line may be two feet in length, but in breadth and depth the coefficient is 
    Zero.&nbsp; We could describe it as 2f &times; 0b &times; 0d, or 
    <em>n</em><sup>2f&nbsp;+&nbsp;0b&nbsp;+&nbsp;0d</sup>.<a href="#2">2</a></p>

    <p>What I proposed in considering &quot;What do we mean by Nothing?&quot; was to
    consider every possible quality of any object as a dimension.</p>

    <p>For instance, one might describe this page as being <em>n</em>f + <em>n</em>'b + <em>n</em>''d + 
    0 <b>r</b>edness + 0 <b>a</b>miability + 0 <b>v</b>elocity + 0 <b>p</b>otential and so on, 
    until you had noted and measured all the qualities it possesses, and excluded all
    that it does not.  For convenience, we may write this expression as
    X<sup>f+b+d+r+a+v+p</sup>&mdash;using the initials of the qualities which we call
    dimensions.</p>

    <p>Just one further explanation in pure mathematics.&nbsp; To interpret X<sup>1</sup>,
    X<sup>1+1</sup> or X<sup>2</sup>, and so on, we assume the reference to be to spatial 
    dimensions.&nbsp; Thus suppose X<sup>1</sup> to be a line a foot long, X<sup>2</sup> 
    will be a plane a foot square, and X<sup>3</sup> a cube measuring a foot in each 
    dimension.&nbsp; But what about X<sup>4</sup>?&nbsp; There are no more spatial 
    dimensions.&nbsp; Modern mathematics has (unfortunately, I think) agreed to consider 
    this fourth dimension as time.&nbsp; Well, and X{5}?&nbsp; To interpret this expression, 
    we may begin to consider other qualities, such as electric capacity, colour,
    moral attributes, and so on.<a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;
    But this remark, although necessary, leads us rather away from our main thesis instead of 
    toward it.</p>

    <p>P.&nbsp; What happens when we put a minus sign before the index (that small
    letter up on the right) instead of a plus?&nbsp; Quite simple.
    x<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>1+1</sup> = X<sup>1</sup> + X<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; 
    With a minus, we divide instead of multiplying.&nbsp; Thus, X<sup>3-2</sup> = X<sup>3</sup> &divide; 
    X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>1</sup>, just as if you had merely subtracted the 2 from the 3 in the index.</p>

    <p>Now, at last, we come to the point of real importance to our thesis: how shall 
    we interpret X<sup>0</sup>?&nbsp; We may write it, obviously, as X<sup>1-1</sup> or
    X<sup>n-n</sup>.&nbsp; Good, divide.&nbsp; Then X<sup>1</sup> &divide; X<sup>1</sup> 
    = 1.&nbsp; This is the same, clearly enough, whatever X may be.</p>

    <p>Q.&nbsp; Ah, but what we started to do was discover the meaning of <em>Nothing</em>.&nbsp;
    It is not correct to write it simply as 0; for that 0 implies an index
    0<sup>1</sup>, or 0{<sup>2</sup>}, or 0<sup>n</sup>.&nbsp; And if our Nothing is to be 
    absolute Nothing, then there is not only no figure, but no index either.&nbsp; So we must 
    write it as 0<sup>0</sup>.</p>

    <p>What is the value of this expression?&nbsp; We proceed as before; divide.</p>

    <p>0<sup>0</sup> = 0<sup>n-n</sup> = 0<sup>n</sup> &divide; 0<sup>n</sup> = (0<sup>n</sup> &divide; 1) 
    &times; (1 &divide; 0<sup>n</sup>).&nbsp; Of course 0<sup>n</sup> &divide; 1 remains 0; but 1 
    &divide; 0{n} = &infin;.</p>

    <p>That is, we have a clash of the &quot;infinitely great&quot; with the &quot;infinitely
    small;&quot; that knocks out the &quot;infinity&quot; (and Advaitism with it!) and
    leaves us with an indeterminate but finite number of utter variety.
    That is: 0<sup>0</sup> can only be interpreted as &quot;The Universe that we know.&quot;</p>

    <p>R.&nbsp; So much for one demonstration.&nbsp; Some people have found fault with
    the algebra; but the logical Equivalent is precisely parallel.&nbsp; Suppose
    I wish to describe my study in one respect:  I can say &quot;No dogs are in
    my study," or "Dogs are not in my study.&quot;&nbsp; I can make a little diagram:
    D is the world of dogs; S is my study.  Here it is:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="005_fig01.gif" width="420" height="170" border="0" /><br>Diagram 1</p>

    <p>The squares are quite separate.&nbsp; The whole world outside the square D is 
    the world of no dogs: outside the square S, the world of no-study.&nbsp; But 
    suppose now that I want to make the Zero absolute, like our 0<sup>0</sup>, 
    I must say &quot;No dogs are not in my study.&quot;</p>

    <p>Or, &quot;There is no absence-of-dog in my study.&quot;&nbsp; That is the same as saying:
    &quot;Some doge <em>are</em> in my study;" diagram again:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="005_fig02.gif" width="307" height="261" order="0" /2><br>Diagram 2</p>

    <p>In Diagram 1, &quot;the world where no dogs are&quot; included the whole of 
    my study; in Diagram 2 that absence-of-dog is no longer there; so one
    or more of them must have got in somehow.</p>

    <p>That's that; I know it may be a little difficult at first; fortunately there 
    is a different way&mdash;the Chinese way&mdash;of stating the theorem in very 
    much simpler terms.</p>

    <p>S. The Chinese, like ourselves, begin with the idea of &quot;Absolute Nothing.&quot;
    They &quot;make an effort, and call it the Tao;&quot; but that is exactly what
    the Tao comes to mean, when we examine it.&nbsp; They see quite well, as we
    have done above, that merely to assert Nothing is not to explain the
    Universe; and they proceed to do so by means of a mathematical equation
    even simpler than ours, involving as it does no operations beyond simple
    addition and subtraction.&nbsp; They say &quot;Nothing obviously means Nothing;
    it has no qualities nor quantities.&quot;&nbsp; (The Advaitists said the same, and
    then stultified themselves completely by calling it One!)&nbsp; &quot;But,&quot; 
    continue the sages of the Middle Kingdom, &quot;it is always possible to reduce
    any expression to Nothing by taking any two equal and opposite terms.&quot;&nbsp;
    (Thus n = (-n) = 0.)&nbsp; &quot;We ought therefore to be able to get any expression 
    that we want <em>from</em> Nothing; we merely have to be careful that the terms shall 
    be precisely opposite and equal.&quot;&nbsp; (0 = n + (-n).&nbsp; This then
    they did, and began to diagrammatize the Universe as the &Icirc;&mdash;a pair of
    opposites, the Yang or active male, and the Yin or passive Female,
    principles.  They represented the Yang by an unbroken ( &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; ), the Yin
    by a broken ( &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; ), line.  (The first manifestation in Nature of these
    two is Thƒi Yang, the Sun, and the Thƒi Yin, the Moon.)  This being a little
    large and loose, they doubled these lines, and obtained the four Hsiang.
    They then took them three at a time, and got the eight Kwa.  These
    represent the development from the original Œ {S.B. cap "I"} to the Natural Order of
    the Elements.</p>

    <p>I shall call the male principle M, the Female F.</p>

    <p>Note how admirably they have preserved the idea of balance.&nbsp; M.1. and
    F.1. are perfection.&nbsp; M.2. and F.2. still keep balance in their lines.
    The four &quot;elements&quot; show imperfection; yet they are all balanced as
    against each other.&nbsp; Note, too, how apt are the ideograms.&nbsp; M.3. shows
    the flames flickering on the hearth, F.3., the wave on the solid bottom
    of the sea; M.4., the mutable air, with impenetrable space above, and
    finally F.4., the thin crust of the earth masking the interior energies
    of the planet.&nbsp; They go in to double these Kw&acirc;, thus reaching the sixty-four 
    Hexagrams of the <em>Y&icirc; King</em>, which is not only a Map, but a History
    of the Order of Nature.</p>

    <p>It is pure enthusiastic delight in the Harmony and Beauty of the System
    that has led me thus far afield; my one essential purpose is to show
    how the Universe was derived by these Wise Men from Nothing.</p>

    <p>When you have assimilated these two sets of Equations, when you have
    understood how 0 = 2 is the unique, the simple, and the necessary solution 
    of the Riddle of the Universe, there will be, in a sense, little more 
    for you to learn about the Theory of Magick.</p>

    <p>You should, however, remember most constantly that the equation of the
    Universe, however complex it may seem, inevitably reels out to Zero;
    for to accomplish this is the formula of your Work as a Mystic.&nbsp; To
    remind you, and to amplify certain points of the above, let me quote
    from <em>Magick</em> pp. 152-3 footnote 2.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>All elements must at one time have been separate&mdash;that would be the
      case with great heat.&nbsp; Now when atoms get to the sun, we get that immense
      extreme heat, and all the elements are themselves again.&nbsp; Imagine that
      each atom of each element possesses the memory of all his adventures in
      combination.&nbsp; By the way, that atom (fortified with that memory) would
      not be the same atom; yet it is, because it has gained nothing from
      anywhere except this memory.&nbsp; Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by
      virtue of memory, a thing could become something more than itself; thus
      a real development is possible.&nbsp; One can then see a reason for any element 
      deciding to go through this series of incarnations, because so, and
      only so, can he go; and he suffers the lapse of memory which he has
      during these incarnations, because he knows he will come through un-
      changed.</p>

      <p>Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods, individual and equal
      though diverse, each one supreme and utterly indestructible.&nbsp; This is
      also the only explanation of how a &quot;Perfect Being&quot; could create a world
      in which war, evil, <em>etc</em>., exist.&nbsp; God is only an appearance, because
      (like &quot;good&quot;) it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply
      its combinations.&nbsp; This is something the same as mystic monotheism; but
      all parts of himself, so that their interplay is false.&nbsp; If we presuppose
      many elements, their interplay is natural.</p>

      <p>It is no objection to this theory to ask who made the elements&mdash;the
      elements are at least there, and God, when you look for him, is not there.&nbsp; 
      Theism is <em>obscurum per obscurius</em>.&nbsp; A male star is built up from
      the centre outwards; a female from the circumference inwards.&nbsp; This is
      what is meant when we say that woman has no soul.&nbsp; It explains fully
      the difference between the sexes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Every &quot;act of love under will&quot; has the dual result (1) the creation of
    a child combining the qualities of its parents, (2) the withdrawal by
    ecstasy into Nothingness.  Please consult what I have elsewhere written
    on &quot;The Formula of Tetagrammaton;&quot; the importance of this at the
    moment is to show how 0 and 2 appear constantly in Nature as the common
    Order of Events.</p>

    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: Add comments to distinguish indices (Abstract Algebra) from powers of numbers.&nbsp;
    I shouldn't, but as a physicist, I have to say that Crowley is giving an erroneous layman's opinion 
    and his usage of math notation cannot be considered correct.&nbsp; These expressions are ok as text, 
    but not as math without redefinition through Abstract Algebra, a field Crowley appears not to know 
    by name.&nbsp; The ideas are valid, but the expressions are misleading.&nbsp; It might be wise to 
    add a footnote about the notation being non-traditional.&nbsp; Notably, this line defies 
    Pythagoras!&nbsp; Crowley's notation with superscripts is the problem.&nbsp; It looks like powers 
    of numbers instead of indices.&nbsp; He probably intended indices, but didn't know how to represent 
    them or flag them in typography &ndash; WEH.</p>
    <p>The problem is that Crowley's later reasoning, in particular his calculations of the value of 
    0<sup>0</sup> only make sense if he means powers.&nbsp; Now there is nothing <em>per se</em> to stop 
    us representing his &quot;categories&quot; in terms of an <em>n</em>-dimensional space, but each 
    category is incommensurable with the others &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="2"><b>2</b>: This is bogus math, plain and simple.&nbsp; If d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, 
    ... d<sub><em>n</em></sub> are the dimensions in <em>n</em> dimensional space of our object, the volume 
    of <em>n</em>-dimensional space it occupies will be d<sub>1</sub> &times; d<sub>2</sub> &times; ...
    &times;d<sub><em>n</em></sub>; if we multiply each dimension by <em>x</em>, the volume of the whole 
    thing is multiplied by <em>x<sup>n</sup></em>.&nbsp; As noted above, the way Crowley develops the 
    argument indicates he is thinking of powers but his use thereof at this point is wrong &ndash; T.S.</p>
