    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LV: Money</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You ask me for the initiated view about the power of money.&nbsp; As the poet
    says: &quot;O.k. oke; I'm yer bloke.&quot;&nbsp; F. Marion Crawford, a Victorian
    novelist, now (I think deservedly) obsolescent, thought I saw one of his
    books last week on the shelves of a tuppenny shark-library,<a href="#ac1">*</a> wrote a
    tale <em>Mr. Isaacs</em> based on the life of one Mr. Jacobs, the Indian Rothschild
    of two generations ago, financing princes, little wars&mdash;everything.&nbsp; One
    night in Bombay the burden of his wealth broke his nerve; he stood at the window 
    of his hotel, and flung masses of money to the mob.  Soon after came a stranger, 
    and said to him, &quot;You have insulted the fourth of the great powers that rule 
    this world; it shall be taken from you.&quot;&nbsp; It was so; he lost all.&nbsp; 
    In the end he became, after a fashion, Sannyasi, and died (I suppose) in the usual 
    odour.</p>

    <p>I thought of this incident in Paris in the twenties, when I saw American
    tourists plaster the bonnets of their cars with 1000 franc notes, or tear
    them up and strew the floors of banks with them.&nbsp; Grimly I prognosticated
    Twenty-Nine.&nbsp; And it was so.</p>

    <p>&quot;Nice work!&quot; you charmingly remark; but hardly what I sought to know.&quot;
    Patience, child!</p>

    <p>Money being the fourth great power, &quot;what are the other three?&quot;&nbsp; Come,
    come, you can surely do that in your head.&nbsp; Four's Tetragrammaton, isn't it?</p>

    <p>Very well, then!&nbsp; The First Great Power is Yod, the Father.&nbsp; Fire, the
    Wand, the Flame of Creative Genius.&nbsp; The Second is H&ccedil;, the Mother, Water,
    the Cup, the Sea to which all things tend; it is the gift of pleasing,
    of absorbing, of drawing all things to oneself.</p>

    <p>The Third is Vau, the Son, the Sword, the moving, penetrating element,
    double in nature.&nbsp; For it is intellect, but also the result of Genius
    absorbed, interpreted, transmuted and applied through the virtue of the
    Cup to expand, to explain, to bring into conscious existence.</p>

    <p>And the Fourth is the H&egrave; final, the Daughter, Earth, the Disk, Pantacle,
    or Coin&mdash;the Coin on which is stamped the effigy of the Word that begat
    it with the aid of the other forms of Energy.&nbsp; It is the Princess of the
    Tarot of whom it is written:&nbsp; &quot;Great indeed is her power when thus firmly
    established.&quot;</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> No money-lender in the drukenness of guilt plus the delirium of
    cocaine fortified by buckets of hashish would dare dream of getting such
    interest on his capital as these vampires.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>It is a trite, and not quite true, saying that money can buy nothing
    worth having.&nbsp; But it can command service, the real measure of power,
    and leisure; without these two advantages the most brilliant genius
    is practically paralysed.&nbsp; It can do much to secure health, or to
    restore it.&nbsp; The truth is that money is only troublesome when one begins
    to count it.</p>

    <p>(This epigram is copyright in Basutoland, the United States of America,
    the Republic of San Marino, the Sanjak of Novibazar, Arabia Petraea,
    and the Scandinavian countries.)</p>

    <p>Then there is travel, by which I do not mean globe-trotting; and privacy, less 
    attainable every year as the Meddlesome Matties invade every corner of life.</p>

    <p>But this is by the way; the text, tenor and thesis of the illuminated
    and illuminating discourse is the above Epigram, which is not merely one
    of the extravagant absurdities for which I am justly infamous.&nbsp; It is
    the Pearl of Great Price.&nbsp; Observe that, formally it is a generalization
    of the principle of the old injunction &quot;to buy the egg of a perfectly
    black hen without haggling.&quot;&nbsp; I want you to realize the supreme 
    importance of this.&nbsp; For one thing, it goes hand-in-hand with the whole
    doctrine of so-called renunciation&mdash;which is nothing of the sort.  You
    don't &quot;renounce&quot; five shillings if you pay that for a country house 
    with 3000 acres of shooting, and the best salmon fishing on Deeside, do you?
    This is the Greater Interpretation of the Injunction, that no <em>equation</em>
    is possible: Magical Power is <em>immeasurably</em> more valuable than any amount
    of money.&nbsp; But the Epigram is severely practical.&nbsp; It may sound a little
    romantic, but&mdash;here goes!&nbsp; A community which thinks in terms of wealth
    is rich; in terms of money, poor.&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; Because the former includes
    the imponderables.</p>

    <p>A couple of Japanese wrestlers may be worth more than Phidias, Robert
    Browning, Titian and Mozart in terms of butchers' meat.&nbsp; We might alter
    that incorrect truism &quot;money cannot by anything worth having&quot; to &quot;things
    worth having cannot be estimated in terms of money.&quot;&nbsp; You see, no 
    <em>counting</em>.&nbsp; The operation to save your child's life: do you care if the 
    surgeon wants five pounds or fifty?&nbsp; Of course, you may not have the fifty, or 
    be obliged to retrench in other ways to get it; but it makes no odds as to
    what you feel about it.&nbsp; What is the value of a University Education?
    The answer is that it is a pure gamble.&nbsp; The student may use his advantages 
    to make a rich marriage, to attract the wife of a millionaire, to earn a judgeship 
    or a post in the Cabinet, to earn &pound;500 a year as a doctor, &pound;150 as a 
    schoolmaster&mdash;or he may die in the process.&nbsp; So with all the spiritual 
    values; they are, in the most literal sense, inestimable.&nbsp; So&mdash;don't start to count!</p>

    <p>Most obviously of all, when it comes to The Great Work, money does not
    count at all.&nbsp; I do not write of any Magical work, in the restricted
    sense of the phrase.  Shaw says: &quot;Admirals always want more battleships&quot;
    and J.F.C. Fuller: &quot;if a lawyer, more wretches to hang.&quot;&nbsp; It applies
    to any one whose heart is in his job.&nbsp; (Of course, in this case, money
    is like all other things of value; nothing counts but the Job.)&nbsp; This,
    too, is sound Magical doctrine.</p>

    <p><em>Lack</em> of money is another matter altogether.</p>

    <p>Isn't it about time you sent me a cheque?</p>
