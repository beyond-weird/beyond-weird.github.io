    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXXI: Method of Training</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>In your well-worn copy of the <em>Bagh-i-muattar</em> you have no doubt triply
    underlined that great verse:</p>

    <blockquote>&quot;Who hath the How is careless of the Why,&quot;</blockquote>

    <p>which shows how cunning I was to induce you to put all your &quot;why&quot;
    questions first.</p>

    <p>But now let us get down to <em>orichalc taques</em>, as the Norman peasant might
    say.</p>

    <p>The first and absolutely essential task for the Aspirant is to write
    his Magical Record.</p>

    <p>You know some elementary Mechanics&mdash;the Triangle of Forces, and all
    that.&nbsp; Well, if we have a body acted on by two equal forces, one pulling
    it East, the other south, it will tend to move in a south-Easterly
    direction.&nbsp; But if the &quot;south&quot; force is (say) twice as strong, it will
    move south of South-East.</p>

    <p>Now you, sitting in your study reading this letter, got there and were
    compelled to do that, as the result of the impact upon you of countless
    quintillions of forces of every kind.  I don't expect you to discover
    all these and calculate and report them; but I want you to set down
    all the main currents.  For so you should be able to get some sort of
    answer to the question &nbsp;Where do we go from here, boys?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I am not a guesser; and I cannot judge you, or advise you, or help you,
    unless and until I know the facts as thoroughly as you are able to allow
    me to do.</p>

    <p>The construction of this Record is, incidentally, the first step in the
    practice called Sammasati, and leads to the acquisition of the Magical
    Memory&mdash;the memory of your previous incarnations.  So there is another
    reason, terrifically cogent, for writing this Magical Record as clearly
    and as fully as you can.</p>

    <p>This best explanation of how to set about the task is given in Liber
    Thisharb.</a></p>

    <p>Some of this sounds rather advanced and technical; but it ought to give
    you the general idea.&nbsp; You should begin with your parents and the family
    traditions; the circumstances of your birth and education; your social
    position; your financial situation; your physique, health, illnesses;
    your vita sexualis; your hobbies and amusements; what you are good at,
    what not; how you came to be interested in the Great Work; what (if
    you have been on false trails, Toshophists, Anthroposophagists, sham
    Rosicrucians, etc.) has been &quot;your previous condition of servitude;&quot;
    how you found me, and decided to enlist my aid.</p>

    <p>That, by itself, helps you to understand yourself, and me to understand
    you.</p>

    <p>From that point the keeping of the Record is quite easy.&nbsp; All you have
    to do is to put down what practices you mean to begin, how you get on
    with them from day to day, and (at intervals) what I have to say about
    your progress.</p>

    <p>Remember always that we have no use for piety, for vague chatter, for
    guesswork; we are as strictly scientific as biologists or chemists.</p>

    <p>We ban emotion from the start; we demand perception; and (as you will
    see later on) even perception is not acceptable until we have made sure
    of its bases by a study of what we call the &quot;tendencies.&quot;</p>

    <p>That is all about the Magical Record; the way is now clear to set
    forth our Method.&nbsp; This is two-fold.&nbsp; (1) Yoga, introversion, (2)
    Magick, extroversion.  (These are rough but useful connotations.)&nbsp; The
    two seem, at first glance, to be opposed; but, when you have advanced
    a little in both, you find that the concentration learnt in Yoga is
    of immense use in attaining the mental powers necessary in magick; on
    the other hand, the discipline of Magick is of the greatest service in
    Yoga.</p>

    <p>Let me remark, by the way, that to my mind one of the greatest beauties,
    and most encouraging confirmations of the validity of our system, is
    the matchless harmony of its elements.&nbsp; Always, when we pursue any one
    path to its end, we find that it has become one with some other path
    which at the outset appeared utterly irreconcilable with it.</p>

    <p>(&quot;Write down that the tearing apart <em>is</em> the crushing together&quot; comes
    from an actual experience.&nbsp; See <em>Liber 418</em>, <em>The Vision and the Voice</em>,
    which teems with similar passages, and is itself an outstanding example
    of the unity of the Yogic and the Magical methods.)</p>

    <p>To study Yoga, you have my <em>Book 4 Part I</em> and my <em>Eight Lectures on Yoga</em>.
    Then there is Vivekananda's <em>Raja Yoga</em> and several little-known Hindu
    writers; these latter are very practical and technical, but one really
    needs to be a Hindu to make much use of them.&nbsp; The former is very good
    indeed, if your remember to switch off when he slides into sloppiness,
    which luckily is not often.</p>

    <p>To study Magick,  <em>Book 4</em>, Parts II, III (<em>Magick in Theory and Practice</em>)
    and IV (<em>The Equinox of the Gods</em>.)<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;  
    Add <em>The Book of Thoth</em> and there you are:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>&quot;Being furnished with complete armour and armed, he is similar to the 
    goddess.<a href="#2">2</a></blockquote>

    <p>Of other writers, you have <em>The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin
    the Mage</em>, and any of the works of Eliphaz L&eacute;vi.&nbsp; But that's all.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;I suppose you knew all this long ago.&nbsp; It may help if I try to
    expound the essence of these two Methods in very simple language, and
    very <em>different language</em>.  By contrast and comparison, you should be
    able, without reading even one of all those books, to get a perfectly
    clear idea in perspective of &quot;what's coming to you!&quot;</p>

    <p>The process of analysing, developing and controlling the mind is the
    essence of all Yoga practices.</p>

    <p>Magick explores and learns to control those regions of Nature which lie
    beyond the objects of sense.&nbsp; Reaching the highest parts of these regions, 
    called the divine, one proceeds by the exaltation (? = intoxication?&nbsp; 
    Yes, of a sublime sort) of the consciousness to identify oneself
    with those &quot;celestial&quot; Beings.</p>

    <p>In Yoga, various practices prevent the body and its functions from
    interrupting the mental process.&nbsp; Then, one inhibits that process
    itself: the stilling of &quot;thoughts&quot; allows one to become aware of men-
    tal functions beyond the intellectual; these functions have their own
    peculiar properties and powers.&nbsp; Each sheath, as one goes deeper, is
    discarded as "unreal;" finally one apprehends that nothing which is
    the only true and real form of existence.&nbsp; (But then it does <em>not</em> exist:
    in these regions of thought words always become nightmares of self-
    contradiction.  This is as it should be.)</p>

    <p>In Magick, on the contrary, one passes through the veil of the exterior
    world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes &quot;unreal&quot; by
    comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument
    is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and controls; 
    it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what
    is called &quot;initiation:&quot; finally, one carries on almost one's whole life
    in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the
    Universe.</p>

    <p>The first step in Yoga is &quot;Keep still.&quot;</p>

    <p>The first step in Magick is &quot;Travel beyond the world of the senses.&quot;</p>

    <p>There, that is the whole business in a nutshell, and expressed so that
    anyone, however ignorant of the subject, may grasp the essentials (I hope).</p>

    <p><em>Notes</em>:</p>
    <p id="#1"><b>1</b>: For the whole history of the conception and execution of the monsterpiece 
    known as <em>Book 4</em>, see the editor's introduction to the 1994 and 1997 Samuel Weiser edition, 
    <em>Magick: Book 4 parts I-IV</em>, popularly known as the &quot;Blue Brick.&quot;&nbsp; Crowley 
    had originally intended part IV, &quot;&Theta;&Epsilon;&Lambda;&Eta;&Mu;&Alpha;&mdash;the Law&quot;
    to comprise <em>The Book of the Law</em> and his final commentary thereon.&nbsp; Symonds and Grant 
    erroneously identified it with the edition of the commentaries which they edited (<em>Magical and Philsophical 
    Commentaries on The Book of the Law</em>, Montreal: 93 Publishing, 1974).&nbsp; <em>The Equinox of the 
    Gods</em> was not designated as part of <em>Book 4</em> on first publication, rather as <em>Equinox</em> 
    vol. III no. 3; as far as I am aware, this letter of MWT is the first published reference to it as 
    <em>Book 4</em> part IV &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="#2"><b>2</b>: A quote from the <em>Chald&aelig;an Oracles</em>, as cited by Proclus in 
    <em>Platonic Theology</em>.&nbsp; Fragment 171 in the Westcott edition.&nbsp; The goddess in 
    question is probably Hekat&eacute;.&nbsp; Johnston in <em>Hekate Soteira</em> renders it &quot;For 
    I have come, a goddess in full armour and with weapons,&quot; making Hekat&eacute; herself the 
    speaker &ndash; T.S.</p>
