    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLIV: &quot;Serious&quot; Style of A.C., or the Apparent Frivolity of Some of my Remarks</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Alas!&nbsp; It is unlikely that either you or I should come upon a copy of
    Max Beerbohm's portrait of Mathew Arnold; but Raven Hill's famous cartoon 
    is history, and can be told as such without the illustration.</p>

    <p>We shall have to go into the matter, because of your very just criticism
    of my magical writings in general&mdash;and these letters, being colloquial,
    are naturally an extreme case.</p>

    <p>Far-off indeed those sunny days when life in England was worth living;
    when one could travel anywhere in Europe&mdash;except Russia and Turkey,
    which spiritually, at least, are in Asia&mdash;or America, without a pass-
    port; when we complained that closing time was twelve-thirty a.m.;
    when there was little or no class bitterness, the future seemed secure,
    and only Nonconformists failed to enjoy the fun that bubbled up on every
    side.</p>

    <p>Well, in those days there were Music-halls; I can't hope to explain to
    you what they were like, but they were <em>jolly</em>.&nbsp; (I'm afraid that there's
    another word beyond the scope of your universe!)&nbsp; At the Empire, Leicester
    Square, which at that time actually looked as if it had been lifted
    bodily from the &quot;Continong&quot; (a very wicked place) there was a promenade,
    with bars complete (<em>drinking</em> bars, my dear child, I blush to say) where
    one might hope to find &quot;strength and beauty met together, Kindle their
    image like a star in a sea of glassy weather.&quot;&nbsp; There one might always
    find London's &quot;soiled doves&quot; (as they revoltingly called them in the
    papers) of every type: Theodora (celebrated &quot;Christian&quot; Empress) and
    Phryne, Messalina and Thais, Baudelaire's swarthy mistress, and Nana,
    Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill.</p>

    <p>But the enemies of life were on guard.&nbsp; They saw people enjoying themselves, 
    (shame!) and they raked through the mildewed parchments of obsolete laws until 
    they found some long-forgotten piece of mischief that might stop it.&nbsp; 
    The withered husks of womanhood, idle, frustrated, spiteful and malignant, 
    called up their forces, blackmailed the Church into supporting them, and began 
    a senseless string of prosecutions.</p>

    <p>Notable in infamy stands out he name of Mrs. Ormiston Chant.</p>

    <p>So here we had the trial of some harmless girl for &quot;accosting;&quot; it was
    a scene from this that inspired Raven Hill's admirable cartoon.</p>

    <p>A &quot;pale young curate&quot; is in the witness box.&nbsp; &quot;The prisoner,&quot; 
    he drawled &quot;made improper proposals to me.&nbsp; The actual words used were: 
    &quot;why do you look so sad, Bertie?'&quot;</p>

    <p>The magistrate: &quot;A very natural question!&quot;</p>

    <p>Now, fifty years later, here am I in the dock.</p>

    <p>(&quot;How can you expect people to take your Magick seriously!&quot; I hear from
    every quarter, &quot;when you write so gleefully about it, with your tongue
    always in your cheek?&quot;)</p>

    <p>My dear good sister, do be logical!</p>

    <p>Here am I who set out nigh half a century ago to seek &quot;The Stone of the
    Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness:&quot;&nbsp; I get it,
    and you expect me to look down a forty-inch nose and lament!</p>

    <p>I have plenty of trouble in life, and often enough I am in low enough
    spirits to please anybody; but turn my thoughts to Magick&mdash;the years
    fall off.&nbsp; I am again the gay, quick, careless boy to whom the world
    was gracious.</p>

    <p>Let this serve for an epitaph: Gray took eleven years; I, less.</p>

    <h4 align="center">Elegy Written in a Country Farmyard</h4>
    <p class="subhead">By<br>Cock-a-doodle-doo</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Here lies upon this hospitable spot<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth to flats and flatties unknown;<br>
      The Plymouth Brethren gave it to him hot;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trinity, Cambridge, claimed him for her own.</p>

      <p>He climbed a lot of mountains in his time<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stalked the tiger, bear and elephant.<br>
      He wrote a stack of poems, some sublime,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some not.&nbsp; Tales, essays, pictures, plays my aunt!</p>

      <p>At chess a minor master, Hoylake set<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His handicap at two.&nbsp; Love drove him crazy.<br>
      Three thousand women used to call him pet;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other matters&mdash;shall we call him &quot;lazy&quot;?</p>

      <p>He had the gift of laughing at himself;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most affably he walked and talked with God;<br>
      And now the silly bastard's on the shelf,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll bury him beneath another sod.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In all the active moods of Nature&mdash;her activity is Worship!  there is
    an element of rejoicing; even when she is at her wildest and most
    destructive.&nbsp; (You know Gilbert's song "When the tiger is a-lashing of
    his tail"?)&nbsp; Her sadness always goes with the implied threat of cessation&mdash;and 
    that we know to be illusion.</p>

    <p>There is nothing worse in religion, especially in the Wisdom-Religion,
    than the pedagogic-horatory accents of the owlish dogmatist, unless it be the 
    pompous self-satisfaction of the prig.&nbsp; Eschew it, sister, eschew it!</p>

    <p>Even in giving orders there is a virile roar, and the commander who is
    best obeyed is he who rages cheerfully like an Eights Coach or a Rugger
    Captain.&nbsp; &quot;Up Guards and at 'em!&quot; may not be authentic; but that is the
    right spirit.</p>

    <p>The curate's twang, the solemnity of self-importance, all manners that
    do not disclose the real man, are abominations, &quot;Anathema Maranatha&quot;&mdash;or 
    any other day of the week.&nbsp; These painted masks are devised to conceal
    chicanery or emptiness.&nbsp; The easy-going humorous style of Vivekananda is
    intelligible and instructive; the platitudinous hot potatoes of Waite
    are neither.&nbsp; The dreadful thing is that this assumption of learning, of
    holiness, of mysterious avenging powers, somehow deceives the average
    student.&nbsp; He does not realise how well and wisely such have conned Wilde's
    maxim: &quot;To be intelligible is to be found out.&quot;</p>

    <p>I know that I too am at times obscure; I lament the fact.&nbsp; The reason is
    twofold: (a) my ineradicable belief that my reader knows all about the
    subject better than I do myself, and (at best) may like to hear it tackled
    from a novel angle, (b) I am carried away by the exultant exaltation of
    my theme: I boil over with rapture&mdash;not the crystal-clear, the cool
    solution that I aimed at.</p>

    <p>On the Path of the Wise there is probably no danger more deadly, no
    poison more pernicious, no seduction more subtle than Spiritual Pride;
    it strikes, being solar, at the very heart of the Aspirant; more, it is
    an inflation and exacerbation of the Ego, so that its victim runs the
    peril of straying into a Black Lodge, and finding himself at home there.</p>

    <p>Against this risk we look to our insurance; there are two infallible:
    Common Sense and the Sense of Humour.&nbsp; When you are lying exhausted and
    exenterate after the attainment of Vishvarupadarshana it is all wrong to
    think: &quot;Well, now I'm the holiest man in the world, of course with the
    exception of John M. Watkins;&quot; better recall the words of the weary
    sceptical judge in A. P. Herbert's <em>Holy Deadlock</em>; he makes a Mantram of
    it!&nbsp; &quot;I put it to you&mdash;I put it to you&mdash;I put it to you&mdash;that 
    you <em>have</em> got a boil on your bottom.&quot;</p>

    <p>To this rule there is, as usual with rules, an exception.&nbsp; Some states of
    mind are of the same structure as poetry, where the &quot;one step from the
    sublime to the ridiculous&quot; is an easy and fatal step.  But even so,
    pedantry is as bad as ribaldry.&nbsp; Personally, I have tried to avoid the
    dilemma by the use of poetic language and form; for instance, in <em>AHA!</em></p>

    <p>It is all difficult, dammed difficult; but if it must be that one's most
    sacred shrine be profaned, let it be the clean assault of laughter rather
    than the slimy smear of sactimoniousness!</p>

    <p>There, or thereabouts, we must leave it.&nbsp; &quot;Out of the fullness of the heart
    the mouth speaketh;&quot; and I cannot sing the words of an epithalamium to
    the music of a dirge.</p>

    <p>Besides, what says the poet?&nbsp; &quot;Love's at its height in pure love?&nbsp; 
    Nay, but after When the song's light dissolves gently in laughter.&quot;</p>

    <p>Oh!&nbsp; &quot;One word more&quot; as Browning said, and poured forth the most puerile
    portentous piffle about that grim blue-stocking &quot;interesting invalid,&quot;
    his spouting wife.&nbsp; Here it is, mercifully much shorter, and <em>not</em> in
    tripping trochees!</p>

    <p>&quot;Actions speak louder than words.&quot;&nbsp; (I positively leak proverbs this
    afternoon&mdash;country air, I suppose): and where actions are the issue,
    devil a joke from Aleister!</p>

    <p>Do you see what is my mark?&nbsp; It is you that I am going to put in the dock
    about &quot;being serious;&quot; and that will take a separate letter&mdash;part of the
    answer to yours received March 10th, 1944 and in general to your entire course of conduct 
    since you came to me&mdash;now over a year ago.<a href="#1">1</a></p>
