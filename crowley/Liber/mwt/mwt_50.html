    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter L: A.C. and the &quot;Masters&quot;; Why they Chose him, <em>etc.</em></h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>&quot;Details about <em>Book 4</em>?&quot;&nbsp; This question lacks precision.&nbsp; 
    I must pull a trigger at a venture.</p>

    <p>The idea of 4 was due to my observation of St. Peter's in Rome; it is
    built with an eye unwavering from the number, as you will see when
    next you go there, aware of the fact.&nbsp; Also, 4 means, on the political
    plane, Temporal Power.&nbsp; (The Qabalistic Architect of St. Peter's knew
    that, and designed his talisman <em>ad hoc</em>.)  This book was then, according
    to Ab-Ul-Diz,<a href="#ac1">*</a> to achieve worldly success.&nbsp; It is my 
    fault if it did not; still, these are early days to judge of that.</p>

    <p>Soror Virakam<a href="#1">1</a> insisted that I should write this in such language 
    that the charwoman and the chimney-sweeper could understand it easily.&nbsp; She
    pulled me up at the first hint of obscurity.</p>

    <p>This went well enough for Part I: Yoga.&nbsp; (And, indeed, that part did
    sell rather well.)&nbsp; But when I had finished Part II, I discovered that
    not only was the book an exceptionally recondite treatise on obscure
    technical points, but was not even an exposition of Magick at all!
    <em>Magick without Tears</em>, indeed!</p>

    <p>This was my crazed humility; I honestly thought that everyone knew all
    about Magick, and how it was done, and why, and so on.&nbsp; There was little
    to do but to erect a superstructure of symbolism.&nbsp; This, by the way,
    has hampered me all my life, in every way; I am so aware of my own
    shameful ignorance on every subject&mdash;there is <em>no</em> mistake about this!&mdash;that 
    I cannot conceive of any human being who is actually more ignorant than myself.&nbsp; 
    How could such an one endure to live, with the consciousness of his infamy gnawing his 
    liver?</p>

    <p>I know this sounds mad; but it's true.&nbsp; Well, then, I set myself to
    repair the omission with Part III; this should be a really complete
    treatise on the Art and Science of magick, and it should be worked out
    from the beginning, a logical sequence like Euclid.&nbsp; Hence Axiom,
    Postulate and Theorems.&nbsp; I supposed even then that I could cover the
    field with another volume comparable in size with the former two.</p>

    <p>I did indeed &quot;finish&quot; this, even announced publication; it was just
    going to Press when War (also announced five years before by Bartzabel,
    the Spirit of Mars) came along in 1914.&nbsp; I toted the rod around the
    world with me (excuse my American!) and in a fatal hour of weakness,
    self-mistrust, took to shewing it to some of my students.&nbsp; Of course&mdash;I 
    might have known&mdash;they all with one accord began: &quot;Oh, but you
    haven't said anything about&mdash;&quot; &mdash;all the subjects in the world.&nbsp; 
    So I started to fill in the gaps.&nbsp; As I did so, I found any amount more
    to do on my own.&nbsp; It went on like that for 14 years!&nbsp; Since it came
    out the voices of detraction have been dumb.&nbsp; I really do believe that
    I've covered the ground at last.&nbsp; Of course, time shewed that Part I,
    although it did really give the essentials of Yoga in the simplest
    possible language, was hardly more than an outline.&nbsp; More, it did not
    correlate Yoga with general philosophy.&nbsp; <em>Eight Lectures</em> have, I believe,
    remedied this.</p>

    <p>As to Part IV, <em>The Book of the Law</em> section, the idea was that the volume
    should comply with the instructions given in AL III,39: &quot;All this and
    a book to say how thou didst come hither and a reproduction of this ink
    and paper for ever&mdash;for in it is the word secret &amp; not only in the
    English&mdash;and thy comment upon this the Book of the Law shall be printed
    beautifully in red ink and black upon beautiful paper made by hand;
    and to each man and woman that thou meetest, were it but to dine or to
    drink at them, it is the Law to give.&nbsp; Then they shall chance to abide
    in this bliss or no; it is no odds.&nbsp; Do this quickly!&quot;&nbsp; I mistook
    &quot;Comment&quot; for &quot;Commentary&quot;&mdash;a word-by-word exposition 
    of every verse (and much of it I loathed with all my heart!) including the 
    Qabalistic interpretation, a task obviously endless.</p>

    <p>What then about AL III, 40</a>?&nbsp; (also see attached)&nbsp; 
    This problem was solved only by achieving the task.&nbsp; In Paris,<a href="#ed1">*</a> in a mood of 
    blank despair about it all, out came the Comment</a>.&nbsp; 
    Easy, yes; inspired, yes; it is, as printed, the exact wording required.&nbsp; No further
    cavilling and quibbling, and controversy and casuistry.&nbsp; All heresiarchs
    are smelt in advance for the rats they are; they are seen brewing (their very 
    vile small beer) in the air (the realm of Intellect&mdash;Swords)
    and they are accordingly nipped in the bud.&nbsp; All Parliamentary requirements 
    thus fulfilled according to the famous formula of the Irish M.P., we can get on 
    to your other questions untroubled by doubt.</p>

    <p>One Textus Receptus, photographically guaranteed.&nbsp; One High Court of
    Interpretation, each for himself alone.&nbsp; No Patristic logomachies!&nbsp; No
    disputed readings!&nbsp; No civil wars and persecutions.&nbsp; Anyone who wants
    to say anything, off with his head, and On with the Dance; let Joy be
    unconfined, You at the prow and Therion at the helm!&nbsp; Off we go.</p>

    <p>&quot;The Masters contacted you.&quot;&nbsp; Can you by any chance mean &quot;The 
    Masters made contact with you?&quot;&nbsp; Assuming that such is the deplorable case, we
    may proceed.</p>

    <p>Firstly, the effort on my part was precisely nil, I resented Their
    interference with proud bitter angry disbelief.&nbsp; The <em>Equinox of the Gods</em>
    describes this in detail.</p>

    <p>But of course Their victim did not have a fair chance of escape.  After
    all, They had had 2000 years to perfect Their plans.  As for me, I had
    a traitor in the heart of the citadel; my Karma for God knows how many
    Incarnations.&nbsp; (The acquisition of the Magical Memory, fragmentary as
    that is, has thrown a great deal of light on that matter.&nbsp; Your letter
    does in fact surmise that this is so.)</p>

    <p>You must understand that the arrival of a New Aeon knocks all the Rules
    sideways.&nbsp; I imagine that even the very strict Magical Code of Ethics
    looks like a cocked hat before They have done with it!</p>

    <p>My theory is that They chose me for (<em>a</em>) my literary skill, knowledge
    and judgment; (<em>b</em>) my scientific training; (<em>c</em>) my familiarity with
    Eastern ways, habits of thought, and sympathetic predisposition; (<em>d</em>)
    my stern adherence to Truth; (<em>e</em>) my moral courage; (<em>f</em>) my dour persistence; 
    and (<em>g</em>) my Karma as aforesaid.</p>

    <p>They prepared me by (<em>a</em>) pushing me rapidly forward both in Magick and
    in Yoga; (<em>b</em>) wearying me of both of them and making me despair of them
    both as a solution to the problem of Life, and (<em>c</em>) fixing me both in
    Buddhistic pessimism and scientific rationalism, so that their victory
    over me might be as difficult and solid as achievement as possible.&nbsp; (I
    am by no means proud of myself.&nbsp; Either I fought them or failed them,
    at every turn.)&nbsp; Chapter V of <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em> might have been
    written with more emphasis; but there are passages elsewhere in that
    volume which lay great stress upon the point.</p>

    <p>Yet, after all, AL II, 10-11 should surely be enough.&nbsp; &quot;O prophet! thou
    hast ill will to learn this writing.&nbsp; I see thee hate the hand &amp; the
    pen; but I am stronger.&quot;</p>

    <p>To interrupt the dictation of a supremely important document, merely
    to jeer at the impotent resentment of the luckless scribe!&nbsp; It seemed
    to me downright ungenerous, the spirit of the triumphant schoolboy bully!</p>

    <p>But Their ways are not as our ways; this question leads us on quite
    naturally to your next point, and the resolution of that know will
    unravel that querulous criticism.&nbsp; Just as a learned Divine might
    chuckle over a smoking-room story, or a heart overflowing with the
    honey of human kindness wish to have the housemaid &quot;seven years a-killing,&quot; 
    so may the greatest of the Masters&mdash;even discarnate!&mdash;have a perverted 
    sense of humour, or a gross error in taste, (see AL I, 51</a>)
    &quot;...sweet wines and wines that foam!...&quot;&mdash;wines, bar Chateau Yquem and very
    full-bodied port, that I dislike and despise&mdash;or any other eccentricity.&nbsp;
    Look at H.P.B.&mdash;hot stuff, if you like!</p>

    <p>It is most necessary that you should understand what happens when on
    goes from Adeptus Exemptus 7&deg;&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&deg; to Magister Templi 
    8&deg;&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&deg;.&nbsp; As you see from a glance at the Tree of 
    Life, this advance entails the Crossing of the Abyss; and <em>there is no Path</em>.&nbsp; 
    That means that one must <em>jump</em>.&nbsp; You must get rid of "all that you have, 
    and all that you are&quot;&mdash;that is one way to put it.</p>

    <p><em>The Vision and the Voice</em>, Aethyrs XVI&mdash;end, gives an immense amount
    of detail; it must be studied intensely, with diligence, with Will,
    and with imagination.&nbsp; Not only the attainment of the grade, but the
    events which go with, or come after, it; all these are described as
    actual Experience.&nbsp; Even so, it is all extraordinarily difficult until
    you have been through it yourself.</p>

    <p>But that part which answers your question is not really very hard to
    grasp; it is indeed most obvious.&nbsp; Ask yourself: then what happens
    to he discarded elements of the Adept?&nbsp; They cannot be left as they
    are, to disintegrate, or to become vehicles for obsession.&nbsp; This entity
    which was the Exempt Adept has been built up in years of unremitting
    toil, as worthy Workshop wherein the Great Work should be accomplished.&nbsp;
    It has moreover been sanctified and glorified by the Knowledge and
    Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>

    <p>So as each Master has his own appointed Work to perform in the world,
    he is cast down into the Sephira, suitable for that work.&nbsp; If his
    function is to be that of a warrior, he would find himself in Geburah;
    if that of a great poet or composer, in Tiphareth; and so on.
    He, the Master, inhabits this dwelling; but, having already got rid
    of it, he is able to allow it to carry on according to its nature
    without interference from the false Self (its head in Da&auml;th) which
    hitherto had hampered it.&nbsp; (&quot;If I were a dog, I should bark; if I were
    an owl, I should hoot,&quot; says Basil King Lamus in <em>The Diary of a Drug-Fiend</em>.)&nbsp; 
    He is totally indifferent to the Event; so then he acts and
    reacts with perfect elasticity.&nbsp; This is the Way of the Tao; and that
    is why you cannot grasp the very idea of that Way&mdash;much less follow
    it!&mdash;unless you are a Master of the Temple.</p>

    <p>Remember in any case, that not only the Adept, but anyone with the
    smallest capacity for Adeptship, is fundamentally an Artist; he will
    certainly not possess any of those bourgeois &quot;virtues&quot; which are just
    so many reactions to Blue Funk.</p>

    <p>Of course, practically all of us in the West get our <em>first</em> knowledge
    from the pious and pretentious drivel of most writers in general 
    circulation.&nbsp; So we start with prejudice.</p>

    <p>Also, asceticism is all right when it is the proper means of attaining
    some special end.&nbsp; It is when it produces eructations of spiritual
    pride, and satisfied vanity, that it is poisonous.&nbsp; The Greek word
    means an athlete; and the training of an athlete is not mortification
    of the body.&nbsp; Nor is there any rule which covers all circumstances.
    When men go &quot;stale&quot; a few days before the race, they are &quot;taken 
    off training,&quot; and fed with champagne.&nbsp; But that is <em>part</em> of the training.&nbsp;
    Observe, too, that all men go &quot;stale&quot; sooner or later; training is abnormal, 
    and must be stopped as soon as its object is attained.&nbsp; Even
    so, it too often strains vital organs, especially the heart and lungs,
    so that few rowing &quot;Blues&quot; live to be 50.&nbsp; But worst of all is the
    effect on the temper!</p>

    <p>When it is permanent, and mistaken for a &quot;Virtue,&quot; it poisons the very
    soil of the soul.&nbsp; The vilest weeds spring up; cruelty, narrowmindedness, 
    arrogance&mdash;everything mean and horrible flowers in those who
    &quot;Mortify the flesh.&quot;&nbsp; Incidentally, such ideas spawn the &quot;Black 
    Brother.&quot;&nbsp; The complete lack of humour, the egomaniac conceit, self-satisfaction,
    absence of all sympathy for others, the craving to pass their miseries on to more 
    sensible people by persecuting them: these traits are symptomatic.</p>

    <p>Well, this is a very brief synopsis, but I hope that it will answer
    your question at least so far as to enable you to understand more easily
    the account of these matters given in <em>The Vision and the Voice</em>.</p>

    <p>P.S.  On reading this over, it has struck me that you may have meant
    to raise a totally different issue; that of &quot;abstract morality.&quot;
    Rather an extensive battlefield; I will dispose my forces in array in
    my next letter of &quot;morality, heavenly link.&quot;<a href="#3">3</a></p>
