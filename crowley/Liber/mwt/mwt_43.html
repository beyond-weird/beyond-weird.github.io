    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLIII: The Holy Guardian Angel is not the &quot;Higher Self&quot; but an Objective Individual</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>On going over some recent letters I see that you question abut William
    Gillette and the Angels was indeed &quot;a red-hot twy-prong that you stick
    to hiss i' the soft of&quot; me.&nbsp; You meant not only to inquire into the
    order of being to which angels belong, but as to whether they are liable
    to accident, misfortune and the like.</p>

    <p>The answer is that it depends on the Angel&mdash;for the purposes of this
    letter I propose to use the word "angel" to include all sorts of disembodied 
    beings, from demons to gods&mdash;in all cases, they are <em>objective</em>;
    a subjective &quot;angel&quot; is different from a dream only in non-essentials.</p>

    <p>Now, some angels are actually emanations of the elements, planets, or
    signs to which they are attributed.&nbsp; They are partial beings in very
    much the same way as are animals.&nbsp; They are not microcosms as are men
    and women.&nbsp; They are almost entirely composed of the planet (or what-
    ever it is) to which they are attributed.&nbsp; The other components of
    their being I take to be almost accidental.&nbsp; For example, the Archangel
    Ratziel is lord of a company of angels called Auphanim; and one must
    not imagine that all these angels are identical with one another, or
    there would not seem to be much sense in it.&nbsp; They have some sort of
    composition, some sort of individuality; and the character and
    appearance of the Angel can be determined by its name.</p>

    <p>I do not think that I have anywhere mentioned how this is done.&nbsp; To
    take an example, let us have Qedemel&mdash;the Hebrew letters as Q.D.M.A.L,
    and the numeration is 175, which is that of the sum of the 1st 49
    numbers, as is proper to Venus.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp; We may 
    then expect the head or head-dress of the spirit to be in some way 
    characteristic of the Sign of Pisces.&nbsp; The general form of the body 
    will be indicated by the Daleth, the letter of Venus, and the lower part 
    (or perhaps the quality) will be determined by the watery Mem&mdash;The 
    termination Aleph Lamed is usually taken to indicate appropriate symbols.&nbsp; 
    For instance, the Aleph might show a golden aura, and the Lamed a pair of 
    balances.&nbsp; Some further detail might be indicated by taking the letters 
    Daleth and Mem together, for Dam is the Hebrew word for blood.&nbsp; From 
    such considerations one can build up a pictorial representation in one's 
    mind which may serve as a standard to which any appearance of him should 
    more or less conform.<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp; 
    The question then takes the form of inquiry into how far such beings are 
    immortal or eternal.</p>

    <p>In the above case, evidently his existence depends on that of the planet
    Venus; and one might suppose that, if that planet were stricken from
    the solar system, there would be no more Qedemel.&nbsp; But this is to judge
    too rashly; for Venus himself is only an emanation of the number 7,
    and is therefore indestructible. {Handwritten note: Because she-he comes from
    ... who is [triangle] + [square], 3 + 4}</p>

    <p>It is some such idea as the above which is at the back of the conventional 
    idea that elementals are immortal, that they incur mortality when
    their ambition and devotion causes them to incarnate as human beings.
    (Is this achieved by some sort of marriage with a reincarnating Ego?
    Or how?&nbsp; All this is very obscure; we need more evidence.)</p>

    <p>You will doubtless have read in many Eastern stories of the destruction
    of dryads or Nats by the cutting down of the tree in which they have
    made their habitation.&nbsp; A nymph, similarly, would be destroyed if her
    fountain were to dry up.</p>

    <p>Now, can an angel of this sort ever go wrong, by which one must mean, can he 
    ever be untrue to his own nature?&nbsp; I do not see how one can imagine this 
    to happen; for they are so completely creatures of the elements of which they 
    are composed that they must be regarded as completely devoid of will in any 
    intelligible sense of the word.&nbsp; Their actions in fact are merely re-actions.</p>

    <p>They are, of course, entirely lacking in the Supernal Triad.&nbsp; There is
    therefore no question of anything in them which would persist through
    change.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be better to say that changed does not really
    affect them.&nbsp; Another way to put it would be that they are adjectives,
    not nouns.&nbsp; They are merely sensible manifestations of the elements to
    which they are attributed, and to the letters of their name.</p>

    <p>Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel;
    and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods
    and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent
    one one particular element for their existence.&nbsp; They are microcosms in
    exactly the same sense as men and women are.&nbsp; They are individuals who
    have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and
    convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves.&nbsp; I want you to understand 
    that a goddess like Astarte, Astaroth, Cotytto, Aphrodite, Hathoor, Venus, are 
    not merely aspects of the planet;<a href="#ac1">*</a> they are separate individuals 
    who have been identified with each other, and attributed to Venus merely because the 
    salient feature in their character approximates to this ideal.</p>

    <p>Now then, it is simple to answer the question of their development,
    their growing old and dying; for, being of the same order of Nature as we
    are ourselves, almost anything which is true of us is true also of them.</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> &quot;Venus&quot; is, of course, a &quot;thing-in-itself;&quot; 
    the planet merely one case of the idea.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>I have tended rather to elaborate this theme, because of the one 
    personally important question which arises in more recent letters; for I
    believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order.&nbsp; He is
    something more than a man, possibly a being who has already passed
    through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship
    with his client is that of friendship, of community, of brotherhood, or
    Fatherhood.&nbsp; He is not, let me say with emphasis, a mere abstraction
    from yourself; and that is why I have insisted rather heavily that the term 
    &quot;Higher Self&quot; implies &quot;a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion.&quot;</p>

    <p>It it were not so, there would be no point in <em>The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage</em>.</p>

    <p>Apart from any theoretical speculation, my Sammasiti and analytical work
    has never led to so much as a hint of the existence of the Guardian
    Angel.  He is not to be found by any exploration of oneself.  It is true
    that the process of analysis leads finally to the realization of oneself
    as no more than a point of view indistinguishable <em>in itself</em> from any
    other point of view; but the Holy Guardian Angel is in precisely the
    same position.&nbsp; However close may be the identities in millions of ways,
    no complete identification is ever obtainable.</p>

    <p>But do remember this, above all else; they are objective, not subjective,
    or I should not waste good Magick on them.</p>

    <p>Let me say in particular in regard to Gods, that the God Jupiter whom
    you invoke is not necessarily the same as he whom I invoke.&nbsp; It is clear
    in any case that the revelation of himself to you is modified in many
    ways by your own particular sensitiveness; just as in ordinary life,
    your idea of a friend may be very different from my own conception of
    the same individual.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, he happens to be a musician,
    there will be an entire side of his character to which I am practically
    insensitive.  You could talk to him for hours, and I would understand
    little or nothing of what was said.&nbsp; Similarly, if he were a mountaineer,
    it would be your turn to be odd man out.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>

    the fourth &quot;magic number&quot; of Venus; 175 is the third, being 1225 &divide; 7, hence the sum of the
