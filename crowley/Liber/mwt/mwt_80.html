    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXX: Life a Gamble</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>In one or two&mdash;no, I think more like three or four&mdash;letters of yours
    to hand in the last couple of months, you have put forward various
    excuses for slackness, the necessities of your economic situation.
    You say you must have &quot;regular work,&quot; and a &quot;steady income&quot; 
    and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; My innocent child, that species of Magick is
    quite simple.&nbsp; Take the horns of a hare&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
    That's enough for the present: I'll tell you what to do with them when you've 
    got them.</p>

    <p>In Macbeth we read&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. . . &quot;Security<br>
      Is mortals' chiefest enemy.&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>but this is another kind of security; it is the Hubris which &quot;tempts
    Providence,&quot; the insolence of thinking that nothing can go wrong.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, there's no such thing as safety.&nbsp; Life is a gamble.&nbsp; From the
    moment of incarnation a million accidents are possible.&nbsp; Miscarriage,
    still-birth, abortion; throughout life, until your heart beats for the
    last time, &quot;you never can tell&quot; &ndash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; 
    and then you start all over again with your next incarnation!</p>

    <p>(I wish I had a copy of a short story of mine called &quot;Every 
    Precaution.&quot; The gallant young Uplift Expert, the one hundred per cent 
    red-blooded, clean-living, heir of the Eternities, takes his young fianc&eacute;e 
    and female counterpart to the &quot;Old Absinthe House&quot; in New Orleans to 
    show her the terrible results of Wrong-Doing.&nbsp; They are going to avoid all
    that; their child is going to be the Quintessence of Americanism.</p>

    <p>They marry and take a cottage by Lake Pasquaney.&nbsp; Presently, he being
    (so she said) away on a business trip, the tradesmen complained that
    she seemed to need very little pabulum.&nbsp; Somehow, people got suspicious,
    and sure enough, when they broke in, they found that she had pickled
    him!&nbsp; This story is founded on fact; damn it, why did the MS have to
    get lost?)</p>

    <p>Even suicide is not a &quot;dead bird.&quot;&nbsp; I knew a creature once&mdash;careless
    observers often mistook him of a man&mdash;who tried three times, pistol,
    rope and poison.&nbsp; Something always went wrong.&nbsp; (Like the Babbacombe
    murderer, who went to the scaffold three times, and lived to a green
    old age!)&nbsp; Finally he did poison himself, by accident, when he had no
    intention whatever of doing anything of the sort.</p>

    <p>Where's the <em>Book of Lies</em>?&nbsp; Ah, here we are.&nbsp; &quot;It is Pure Chance 
    that rules the Universe; therefore, and only therefore, life is good.&quot;<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p>Then, is it mere fatuity and folly to make plans?&nbsp; Was not the IXth
    Atu, the Hermit, also at one time called &quot;Prudence?&quot;<a href="#2">2</a>&nbsp; 
    Of course.&nbsp; Abstract philosophy rarely coincides with common-sense.&nbsp; We should
    plan as carefully as we can; but we should always allow a margin for
    every conceivable accident.</p>

    <p>Nor should we <em>trust</em> to luck, like England, when she goes to war.&nbsp; 
    Bret Harte has an admirable story &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&nbsp; in which the
    &quot;bad man,&quot; the crooked gambler, gives his life for the safety of the
    rest of his party, and winds up all with the remark: &quot;Life isn't in
    having the luck of the cards, but in playing a poor hand well.&quot;</p>

    <p>Yes, I daresay, all very fine; but what you wanted to know was about
    the propriety of taking risks in Magick.</p>

    <p>So off we go.</p>

    <p>Risks, we have agreed, are always unavoidable; but we can calculate them.&nbsp; 
    The best and wisest man I ever knew, the late Oscar Eckenstein, was once offered 
    a job which gave him a fifty percent chance of survival.&nbsp; He calmly sat down, 
    worked out his &quot;expectation of life,&quot; his &quot;expectation of income,&quot; 
    and the Lord alone knows what other factors.&nbsp; It came out that the pay offered 
    was a thousand pounds or so less than he might expect normally, so he turned down the 
    offer.&nbsp; Not a trace of sentiment of any kind!</p>

    <p>Now let us consider an &quot;A.B. case.&quot;&nbsp; John Jeremiah Jenkins sees a short
    cut to his performance of the Great work.&nbsp; To seize this opportunity,
    he must give up a steady job with good prospects and as near safety as
    is possible in the nature of things, for a slim chance of a career in
    the most insecure of all the professions.</p>

    <p>He <em>can</em> do it; that is at the mercy of his Will; but he risks something
    very close to the utter wreck and ruin of his future.&nbsp; Only a miracle
    can bring him through.&nbsp; Just so!&nbsp; But is he not neglecting one factor
    in his problem?&nbsp; Who put this romantically insane opportunity in his
    way?&nbsp; The Gods: it must be, since he is performing the Great Work.&nbsp; Very
    well then!&nbsp; It is up to Them to watch: &quot;he shall give his angels charge
    over thee to keep thee in all thy ways: in their hands they shall bear
    thee up lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.&quot;</p>

    <p>What's more, he must leave it at that; he must not insult Them by
    constantly looking out for extra safeguards, or &quot;hedging.&quot;&nbsp; (You remember
    the Major in <em>The Suicide Club</em> when Prince Florizel was picking seconds
    for a duel?&nbsp; &quot;In all my life I never so much as hedged a bet.&quot;)&nbsp; You
    must give Them plenty of opportunity to show Their approval by steering
    you miraculously through one crisis after another.</p>

    <p>This course of conduct may seem to you a little like the <a href="mwt_19">&quot;Act of Truth&quot;</a>
    but this is only superficially the case.  The latter is usually an
    emergency measure, and either not particularly serious or as serious
    as anything can be.&nbsp; But what I have said above amounts really to a
    regular Rule of Life.</p>

    <p>Need I add that the prime and essential requisite in all this Work is
    that you so devote yourself to, and identify yourself with, the Gods,
    that there is never any doubt in your mind as to what They intend you
    to do?</p>

    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: Chapter 22 (KB), &quot;The Despot.&quot;&nbsp; In the copy of MWT I 
    was working from it was slightly misquoted; the quote is here conformed to the second 
    edition of <em>The Book of Lies</em> &ndash; T.S.</p>
    <p id="2"><b>2</b>: Note that the three other &quot;cardinal virtues&quot; have 
    traditionally been referred to Tarot Trumps: Justice, Fortitude (also known as Strength)
    and Temperence (though Waite, in a note to Levi's <em>Dogme et Rituel</em>, suggests the 
    attribution of Prudence to Atu IX was an invention of Levi's to complete the scheme; an 
    alternative but somewhat strained suggestion has Atu XX as 'prudential judgement').&nbsp; 
    It may or may not be significant that when reformulating the Tarot in <em>The Book of Thoth</em> 
    Crowley changed the names of all three of these &ndash; T.S.</p>
