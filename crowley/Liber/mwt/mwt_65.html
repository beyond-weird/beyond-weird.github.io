    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXV: Man</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>In previous letters I hope I have been able to give you some idea of
    the initiated conception of the Macrocosm, and also to have made it
    clear to you why we must all use a symbolic language, and the necessity
    of constructing a special alphabet as the basis of our conversations
    about Magick.</p>

    <p>I have also furnished you with charts of this alphabet.&nbsp; It would of
    course have been too clumsy and cumbersome to put all the different
    systems of symbol on to the Tree of Life.&nbsp; That Tree is indeed the basis
    of all our classification, and I hope by now you have got fairly familiar
    with the process of sticking everything that turns up on its correct
    branch of the Tree.</p>

    <p>In your last letter you thank me for having made clear to you the
    initiated teaching with regard to the Universe; and you now very rightly 
    enquire &quot;this being so, where do we come in?&quot;&nbsp; You hold up to me
    one of the oldest axioms of the Qabalah.&nbsp; &quot;That which is above is like
    that which is below,&quot; and you ask me for details.&nbsp; What, you enquire,
    is the constitution of Man?&nbsp; With what parts of the Great System is the
    Little System to coincide?</p>

    <p>Perhaps I could hardly do better than call your attention to the description 
    given in my essay on Man</a> in my small book 
    Little Essays Toward Truth</a>.</p>

    In some respects indeed this description is not as clear as I could
    have wished.&nbsp; The fact is that this Essay was written chiefly for the
    benefit of those people who were already more or less familiar with the
    Tree of Life and its correspondences.&nbsp; But I do not know even to-day,
    twenty years later, and writing as I am to you who admittedly had no
    previous knowledge of any of these subjects, how to set forth the facts
    in more elementary terms.&nbsp; I warned you in the beginning that there was
    an essential difficulty in these studies which is not to be by-passed
    or dodged in any way whatever.

    <p>But, after all, it is the same difficulty which every child finds when
    he begins any study of any kind.&nbsp; In Latin, for instance, he is told
    that <em>mensa</em> means a table, that it belongs to the first declension and is
    feminine.&nbsp; There is no why about any of this; no explanation is possible;
    the child has to pick up the elements of the language one by one, taking
    what he is taught on trust.&nbsp; And it is only after accumulating a vast
    collection of unintelligible details that the jig-saw pieces fall into
    place, and he finds himself able to construe the classical texts.</p>

    <p>You must be patient; you must go over and over again everything that is
    presented to you, and by obeying you will not only come to a clear comprehension 
    of the subject, but find yourself automatically thinking in
    the language which you have been at such pains to acquire.</p>

    <p>I feel then that I must leave you with these descriptions and these
    charts until painfully at first, but at the end with intense pride and
    gratification, you find yourself spontaneously grasping the more complex
    combinations of these letters and words which are the anatomy of the
    body of our Learning.</p>

    <p>And do not forget the old and well-worn saw: &quot;Drink deep, or taste not
    the Pierian Spring!&mdash;A little learning is a dangerous thing.&quot;</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>

    <p><em>Note</em>: In the original this letter was accompanied by four Tree of Life 
    diagrams, three of which were copies of those which appeared in <em>The Book of Thoth</em>.&nbsp; 
    They have been redrawn and in some cases re-arranged in an attempt to make the information 
    readable on a computer screen.</p>
    <h4 align="center">THE KEY SCALE.</h4>
    
    <p align="center">
	<img src="mwttree1.gif" width="600" height="764" border="1" /></p>
    <p>This figure shows the Sephiroth with their numbers only, and the Paths with Hebrew letters corresponding.&nbsp; 
    The first number on each Path is its &quot;key scale&quot; number, the second is the numerical value of the 
    letter.</p>

    <p align="center">
	<img src="mwttree2.gif" width="600" height="1000" border="1" /></p>
    <p>This figure shows the name of the Sephiroth and the letters of the Paths in English, Hebrew and transliterated 
    Hebrew.&nbsp; In the original edition the information on this and the above were combined into a single diagram 
    which thus became unreadable in places.</p>

    <p>This shows Crowley's later attributions of the Taoist principles including the eight trigrams of the <em>Yi King</em> 
    to the Sephiroth.&nbsp; These differ somewhat from those in 777 col. XLVI and Appendix I.</p>

    <p>The figure on which this is based was probably a copy of the diagram accompanying 
    the first edition of <em>Little Essays Toward Truth</em> and shows the A.'.A.'. grades 
    on the Tree of Life along with the Four Worlds and the Qabalistic Soul.<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: This duplicates the G.'.D.'. confusion of the parts of the soul 
    with the four Qabalistic worlds&mdash;as started by Mathers through misinterpretation
    of traditional Qabalah.&nbsp; The error of omitting the sixth traditional part,
    the Guff, is also perpetuated here.&nbsp; No big issue, but I'm picky &ndash; WEH.&nbsp; 
    The confusion between the Qabalistic worlds and parts of the soul first appears to have 
    been perpetrated by Mathers in his introduction to <em>Kabbalah Unveiled</em> (s.72 and 
    subjoined plate).&nbsp; The G'uph, identified with the physical body, is mentioned in 
    the account of the Qabalistic Soul in Zalewski, <em>Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn</em>
