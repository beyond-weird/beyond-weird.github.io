    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXXV: The Tao (2)</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You are only one of a number of people who are interested in my translation 
    of the <em>Tao Teh King</em>.  Naturally, I want to publish it; but so many
    other things come first.  So I am sending you the Introduction, in the
    hope that it will stimulate that interest to the point of getting some
    other publisher to give it sea-room.<a href="#1">1</a></p>

    <p>I bound myself to devote my life to Magick at Easter 1898 (era vulgari)
    and received my first initiation on November 18 of that year.</p>

    <p>My friend and climbing companion, Oscar Eckenstein, gave me my first
    instructions in learning the control of the mind early in 1901, in
    Mexico City.&nbsp; Shri Parananda, Solicitor General of Ceylon, an eminent
    writer upon, and teacher of, Yoga from the orthodox Shaivite standpoint,
    and Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya, (Allan Bennett) the great English Adept, who
    was one of my earliest instructors in Magick, and joined the Sangha in
    Burma in 1902, gave me my first groundings in mystical theory and practice.&nbsp; 
    I spent some months of 1901 in Kandy, Ceylon with the latter, until success crowned my work.</p>

    <p>I also studied all varieties of Asiatic philosophy, especially with
    regard to the practical question of spiritual development, the Sufi
    doctrines, the <em>Upanishads</em>, the <em>Sankhra</em>, <em>Veda</em> and 
    <em>Vedanta</em>, the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em> and <em>Purana</em>, the <em>Dammapada</em>, 
    and many other classics, together with numerous writings on the Tantra and Yoga 
    of such men as Patanjali, Vivekananda, etc., etc.  Not a few of these teachings 
    are as yet wholly unknown to scholars.&nbsp; I made the scope of my studies as 
    comprehensive as possible, omitting no school of thought however unimportant or
    repugnant.</p>

    <p>I made a critical examination of all these teachers in the light of my
    practical experience.&nbsp; The physiological and psychological uniformity of
    mankind guaranteed that the diversity of expression concealed a unity of
    significance.&nbsp; This discovery was confirmed, furthermore, by reference
    to Jewish, Greek, and Celtic traditions.&nbsp; One quintessential truth was
    common to all cults, from the Hebrides to the Yellow Sea; and even the
    main branches proved essentially identical.&nbsp; It was only the foliage
    that exhibited incompatibility.</p>

    <p>When I walked across China in 1905-6, I was fully armed and accoutred
    by the above qualifications to attack the till-then-insoluble problem
    of the Chinese conception of religious truth.&nbsp; Practical studies of the
    psychology of such Mongolians as I had met in my travels, had already
    suggested to me that their acentric conception of the universe might
    represent the correspondence in consciousness of their actual psychological 
    characteristics.&nbsp; I was therefore prepared to examine the doctrines 
    of their religious and philosophic Masters without prejudice such as had 
    always rendered nugatory the efforts of missionary sinologists; indeed, 
    all oriental scholars with the single exception of Rhys Davids.&nbsp; Until 
    his time, translators had invariable assumed, with absurd naiv&eacute;t&eacute;, 
    or (more often) arrogant bigotry, that a Chinese writer must be putting forth 
    either a more or less distorted and degraded variation of some Christian 
    conception, or utterly puerile absurdities.&nbsp; Even so great a man as Max 
    M&uuml;ller, in his introduction to the <em>Upanishads</em>, seems only half 
    inclined to admit that the apparent triviality and folly of many passages in 
    these so-called sacred writings might owe their appearance to our ignorance 
    of the historical and religious circumstances, a knowledge of which would render 
    them intelligible.</p>

    <p>During my solitary wanderings among the mountainous wastes of Yun Nan,
    the spiritual atmosphere of China penetrated my consciousness, thanks
    to the absence of any intellectual impertinences from the organ of
    knowledge.&nbsp; The <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em> revealed its simplicity 
    and sublimity to my soul, little by little, as the conditions of my 
    physical, no less than of my spiritual life, penetrated the sanctuaries 
    of my spirit.&nbsp; The philosophy of Lao Tze communicated itself to me, 
    in despite of the persistent efforts of my mind to compel it to conform 
    with my preconceived notions of what the text must mean.&nbsp; This process, 
    having thus taken root in my innermost intuition during those tremendous 
    months of wandering Yun Nan, grew continually throughout succeeding years.&nbsp; 
    Whenever I found myself able once more to withdraw myself from the dissipations
    and distractions which contact with civilization forces upon a man, no
    matter how vigorously he may struggle against their insolence, to the
    sacred solitude of he desert, whether among the sierras of Spain or the
    sands of the Sahara, I found that the philosophy of Lao Tze resumed its
    sway upon my soul, subtler and stronger on each successive occasion.</p>

    <p>But neither Europe nor Africa can show any such desolation as America.
    The proudest, stubbornest, bitterest peasant of deserted Spain, the most
    primitive and superstitious Arab of the remotest oases, are a little more
    than kin and never less than kind at their worst; whereas in the United
    States one is almost always conscious of an instinctive lack of sympathy
    and understanding with even the most charming and cultured people.&nbsp; It
    was therefore during my exile in America that the doctrines of Lao Tze
    developed most rapidly in my soul, ever forcing their way outwards until
    I felt it imperious, nay inevitable, to express them in terms of conscious
    thought.</p>

    <p>No sooner had this resolve taken possession of me than I realized that
    the task approximated to impossibility.&nbsp; His very simplest ideas, the
    primitive elements of his thought, had no true correspondences in any
    European terminology.&nbsp; The very first word &quot;Tao&quot; presented a 
    completely insoluble problem.&nbsp; It had been translated &quot;Reason&quot;, 
    &quot;The Way&quot;, &quot;&Tau;&omicron; &Omicron;&nu;.&quot;&nbsp;
    None of these convey any true conception of the Tao.</p>

    <p>The Tao is reason in this sense, that the substance of things may be in
    part apprehended as being that necessary relation between the elements
    of thought which determines the laws of reason.&nbsp; In other words, the
    only reality is that which compels us to connect the various forms of
    illusion as we do.&nbsp; It is thus evidently unknowable, and expressible
    neither by speech nor by silence.&nbsp; All that we can know about it is that
    there is inherent in it a power (which however is not itself) by virtue
    whereof all beings appear in forms congruous with the nature of necessity.</p>

    <p>The Tao is also &quot;the Way&quot;&mdash;in the following sense.&nbsp; Nothing 
    exists except as a relation with other similarly postulated ideas.&nbsp; Nothing 
    can be known in itself, but only as one of the participants in a series of
    events.&nbsp; Reality is therefore in the motion, not in the thing moved.
    We cannot apprehend anything except as one postulated element of an
    observed impression of change.</p>

    <p>We may express this in other terms as follows.&nbsp; Our knowledge of anything
    is in reality the sum of our observations of its successive movements,
    that is to say, of its path from event to event.&nbsp; In this sense the Tao
    may be translated as &quot;the Way.&quot;&nbsp; It is not a thing in itself in the 
    sense of being an object susceptible of apprehension by sense or mind.&nbsp; It is
    not the cause of any thing; it is rather the category underlying all
    existence or event, and therefore true and real as they are illusory,
    being merely landmarks invented for convenience in describing our exper-
    iences.&nbsp; The Tao possesses no power to cause anything to exist or to
    take place.&nbsp; Yet our experience when analyzed tells us that the only
    reality of which we may be sure is this path or Way which resumes the
    whole of our knowledge.</p>

    <p>As for &Tau;&omicron; &Omicron;&nu;,<a href="#2">2</a> which superficially might seem the 
    best translation of Tao as described in the text, it is the most misleading of the 
    three.&nbsp; For <em>To On</em> possesses an extensive connotation implying a whole system
    of Platonic concepts, than which nothing can be more alien to the essential quality of 
    the Tao.&nbsp; Tao is neither &quot;being&quot; nor &quot;not being&quot; in any sense 
    which Europe could understand.&nbsp; It is neither existence, nor a condition or 
    form of existence.&nbsp; Equally, TO MH ON gives no idea of Tao.&nbsp; Tao is altogether 
    alien to all that class of thought.&nbsp; From its connection with &quot;that principle 
    which necessarily  underlies the fact that events occur&quot; one might suppose that the 
    &quot;Becoming&quot; of Heraclitus might assist us to describe the Tao.&nbsp; But the Tao 
    is not a principle at all of that kind.&nbsp; To understand it requires an altogether
    different state of mind to any with which European thinkers in general are familiar.&nbsp; 
    It is necessary to pursue unflinchingly the path of spiritual development on the lines 
    indicated by the Sufis, the Hindus and the Buddhists; and, having reached the trance 
    called Nerodha-Sammapati, in which are destroyed all forms soever of consciousness, 
    there appears in that abyss of annihilation the germ of an entirely new type of idea,
    whose principal characteristic is this: that the entire concatenation of One's previous 
    experiences and conceptions could not have happened at all, save by virtue of this 
    indescribable necessity.</p>

    <p>I am only too painfully aware that the above exposition is faulty in
    every respect.&nbsp; In particular, it presupposes in the reader considerable
    familiarity with the subject, thus practically begging the question.&nbsp; It
    must also prove almost wholly unintelligible to the average reader, him
    in fact whom I especially aim to interest.</p>

    <p>For his sake I will try to elucidate the matter by an analogy.&nbsp; Consider
    electricity.&nbsp; It would be absurd to say that electricity <em>is</em> any of the
    phenomena by which we know it.&nbsp; We take refuge in the <em>petitio principii</em>
    of saying that electricity is that form of energy which is the principal
    cause of such and such phenomena.&nbsp; Suppose now that we eliminate this
    idea as evidently illogical.&nbsp; What remains?&nbsp; We must not hastily answer
    &quot;Nothing remains.&quot;&nbsp; There is some thing inherent in the nature of 
    consciousness, reason, perception, sensation, and of the universe of which
    they inform us, which is responsible for the fact that we observe these
    phenomena and not others; that we reflect upon them as we do, and not
    otherwise.&nbsp; But, even deeper than this, part of the reality of the
    inscrutable energy which determines the form of our experience, consists
    in determining that experience should take place at all.&nbsp; It should be
    clear that this has nothing to do with any of the Platonic conceptions
    of the nature of things.</p>

    <p>The least abject asset in the intellectual bankruptcy of European thought
    is the Hebrew Qabalah.&nbsp; Properly understood, it is a system of symbolism
    indefinitely elastic, assuming no axioms, postulating no principles,
    asserting no theorems, and therefore adaptable, if managed adroitly, to
    describe any conceivable doctrine.&nbsp; It has been my continual study since
    1898, and I have found it of infinite value in the study of the &quot;<em>Tao Teh</em>
    K<em>ing</em>.&quot;&nbsp; By its aid I was able to attribute the ideas of Lao Tze to 
    an order with which I was exceedingly familiar, and whose practical worth
    I had repeatedly proved by using it as the basis of the analysis and
    classification of all Aryan and Semitic religions and philosophies.&nbsp;
    Despite the essential difficulty of correlating the ideas of Lao Tze with 
    any others, the persistent application of the Qabalistic keys eventually 
    unlocked his treasure-house.&nbsp; I was able to explain to myself
    his teachings in terms of familiar systems.</p>

    <p>This achievement broke the back of my Sphinx.  Having once reduced Lao
    Tze to Qabalistic form, it was easy to translate the result into the
    language of philosophy.&nbsp; I had already done much to create a new language
    based on English with the assistance of a few technical terms borrowed
    from Asia, and above all by the use of a novel conception of the idea
    of Number and of algebraic and arithmetical procedure to convey the
    results of spiritual experience to intelligent students.</p>

    <p>It is therefore not altogether without confidence that I present this
    translation of the <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em> to the public.&nbsp; I hope and believe that
    careful study of the text, as elucidated by my commentary, will enable
    serious aspirants to the hidden Wisdom to understand (with fair accuracy)
    what Lao Tze taught.&nbsp; It must however be laid to heart that the essence
    of his system will inevitably elude intellectual apprehension, unless it
    be illuminated from above by actual living experience of the truth.&nbsp; Such
    experience is only to be attained by unswerving application to the prac-
    tices which he advocates.&nbsp; Nor must the aspirant content himself with
    the mere attainment of spiritual enlightenment, however sublime.&nbsp; All
    such achievements are barren unless they be regarded as the means rather
    than the end of spiritual progress; allowed to infiltrate every detail
    of the life, not only of the spirit, but of the senses.&nbsp; The Tao can
    never be known until it interprets the most trivial actions of every
    day routine.&nbsp; It is a fatal mistake to discriminate between the spiritual
    importance of meditation and playing golf.&nbsp; To do so is to create an
    internal conflict.&nbsp; &quot;Let there be no difference made among you between
    any one thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.&quot;<!-- source quote -->&nbsp; 
    He who knows the Tao knows it to be the source of all things soever; the most
    exalted spiritual ecstasy and the most trivial internal impression are
    from our point of view equally illusions, worthless masks, which hide,
    with grotesque painted pasteboard false and lifeless, the living face
    of truth.&nbsp; Yet, from another point of view, they are equally expressions
    of the ecstatic genius of truth&mdash;natural images of the reaction between
    the essence of one's self and one's particular environment at the moment
    of their occurrence.&nbsp; They are equally tokens of the Tao by whom, in
    whom, and of whom, they are.&nbsp; To value them for themselves is to deny
    the Tao and to be lost in delusion.&nbsp; To despise them is to deny the
    omnipresence of the Tao, and to suffer the illusion of sorrow.&nbsp; To
    discriminate between them is to set up the accursed dyad, to surrender
    to the insanity of intellect, to overwhelm the intuition of truth, and
    to create civil war in the consciousness.</p>

    <p>From 1905 to 1918 the <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em> was my continual study.&nbsp; I
    constantly recommended it to my friends as the supreme masterpiece of initiated
    wisdom, and I was as constantly disappointed when they declared that it
    did not impress them, especially as my preliminary descriptions of the
    book had aroused their keenest interest.&nbsp; I thus came to see that the
    fault lay with Legge's translation, and I felt myself impelled to undertake 
    the task of presenting Lao Tze in language informed by the sympathetic 
    understanding which initiation and spiritual experience had
    conferred on me.&nbsp; During my Great Magical Retirement on Aesopus Island
    in the Hudson River during the summer of 1918, I set myself to this
    work, but I discovered immediately that I was totally incompetent.&nbsp; I
    therefore appealed to an Adept named Amalantrah, which whom I was at that 
    time in almost daily communication.&nbsp; He came readily to my aid, and
    exhibited to me a codex of the original, which conveyed to me with
    absolute certitude the exact significance of the text.&nbsp; I was able to
    divine without hesitation or doubt the precise manner in which Legge
    had been deceived.&nbsp; He had translated the Chinese with singular fidelity,
    yet in almost every verse the interpretation was altogether misleading.&nbsp;
    There was no need to refer to the text from the point of view of scholarship.&nbsp; 
    I had merely to paraphrase his translation in the light of actual knowledge of the 
    true significance of the terms employed.&nbsp; Any one who cares to take the trouble 
    to compare the two versions will be astounded to see how slight a remodeling of a 
    paragraph is sufficient to disperse the obstinate obscurity of prejudice, and let 
    loose a fountain and a flood of living light; to kindle the gnarled prose of stolid 
    scholarship into the burgeoning blossom of lyrical flame.</p>

    <p>I completed my translation within three days, but during the last twenty
    years I have constantly reconsidered every sentence.&nbsp; The manuscript has
    been lent to a number of friends, scholars who have commended my work,
    and aspirants who have appreciated its adequacy to present the spirit
    of the Master's teaching.&nbsp; Those who had been disappointed with Legge's
    version were enthusiastic about mine.&nbsp; This circumstance is in itself
    sufficient to assure me that Love's labour has not been lost, and to
    fill me with enthusiastic confidence that the present publication will
    abundantly contribute to the fulfillment of my True Will for which I
    came to earth.&nbsp; Let us wring from labour and sorrow the utmost of which
    humanity is capable.&nbsp; Fulfill my Will to open the portals of spiritual
    attainment to my fellowmen, to bring them to the enjoyment of that
    realization of Truth, beneath all veils of temporal falsehood, which
    has enlightened mine eyes and filled my mouth with song.</p>

    <p>So there you are.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
