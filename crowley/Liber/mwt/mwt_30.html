    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXX: Do you believe in God?</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You are quite right, as usual.  True, we have gone over a great deal of
    the ground in various learned disquisitions of Gods, Angels, Elves, 
    <em>et hoc genus omne</em>.</p>

    <p>But God with a capital &quot;G&quot; in the singular is a totally different pair of
    Bl&uuml;chers&mdash;<em>nicht wahr</em>?</p><!-- find out what the hell that ?German? word means -->

    <p>Let me go back just for a moment to the meaning of &quot;belief.&quot;&nbsp; We agreed
    that the word was senseless except as it implies an opinion, instinct,
    conviction&mdash;what you please!&mdash;so firmly entrenched in our natures
    that we act automatically as if it were &quot;true&quot; and &quot;certain without
    error,&quot; perhaps even &quot;of the essence of truth.&quot;<a href="#1">1</a>
    (Browning discusses this in <em>Mr. Sludge the Medium</em>.)&nbsp; Good: the field is clear 
    for an enquiry into this word &nbsp;God.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We find ourselves in trouble from the start.</p>

    <p>We must define; and to define is to limit; and to limit is to reduce
    &quot;God&quot; to &quot;<em>a</em> God&quot; or at best &quot;<em>the</em> God.&quot;

    <p>He must be omniscient (Mercury) omnipotent, (Sulphur) and omnipresent (Salt);<a href="#2">2</a> 
    yet to such a Being no <em>purpose</em> would be possible; 
    so that all the apologies for the existence of &quot;evil&quot; crash.&nbsp; If there 
    be opposites of any kind, there can be no consistency.&nbsp; He cannot be Two; He must 
    be One; yet, as is obvious, he isn't.</p>

    <p>How do the Hindu philosophers try to get out of this quag?&nbsp; &quot;Evil&quot; is
    &quot;illusion;&quot; has no &quot;real&quot; existence.&nbsp; Then what is the point of it?</p>

    <p>They say &quot;Not that, not that!&quot; denying to him all attributes; He is
    &quot;that which is without quantity or quality.&quot;&nbsp; They contradict themselves
    at every turn; seeking to remove limit, they remove definition.&nbsp; Their only refuge 
    is in &quot;superconsciousness.&quot;&nbsp; Splendid! but now &quot;belief&quot; has
    disappeared altogether; for the word has no sense unless it is subject
    to the laws of normal thought... Tut! you must be feeling it yourself;
    the further one goes, the darker the path.&nbsp; All I have written is somehow 
    muddled and obscure, maugre my frenzied struggle for lucidity,
    simplicity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

    <p>Is this the fault of my own sophistication?&nbsp; I asked myself.&nbsp; Tell you
    what!&nbsp; I'll trot round to my masseuse, and put it up to her.&nbsp; She is a
    simple country soul, by no means over-educated, but intelligent; capable
    of a firm grasp of the principles of her job; a steady church-goer on
    what she considers worthwhile occasions; dislikes the rector, but
    praises his policy of keeping his discourse within bounds.&nbsp; She has
    done quite a lot of thinking for herself; distrusts and despises the
    Press and the Radio, has no use for ready-made opinions.&nbsp; She shares
    with the flock their normal prejudices and phobias, but is not bigoted
    about them, and follows readily enough a line of simply-expressed
    destructive criticism when it is put to her.&nbsp; This is, however, only a
    temporary reaction; a day later she would repeat the previous inanities
    as if they had never been demolished.&nbsp; In the late fifties, at a guess.
    I sprang your question on her out of the blue, &agrave; la &quot;doodle-bug;&quot;
    premising merely that I had been asked the question, and was puzzled as
    to how to answer it.&nbsp; Her reply was curious and surprising: without a
    moment's hesitation and with great enthusiasm, &quot;Quickly, yes!&quot;&nbsp; The
    spontaneous reservation struck me as extremely interesting.&nbsp; I said:
    of course, but suppose you think it over&mdash;and out&mdash;a bit, what am I
    to understand?&nbsp; She began glibly &quot;He's a great big&mdash;&quot; and broke off,
    looking foolish.&nbsp; Then, although omnipotent, He needed our help&mdash;we
    were all just as powerful as He, for we were little bits of each other&mdash;but 
    exactly how, or to what end, she did not make clear.&nbsp; An exclamation: 
    &quot;Then there is the Devil!&quot;</p>

    <p>She went on without a word from me for a long while, tying herself up
    into fresh knots with every phase.&nbsp; She became irreverent, then downright 
    blasphemous; stopped short and began to laugh at herself.&nbsp; And so 
    forth&mdash;but, what struck me as curious and significant, in the main her 
    argument followed quite closely the lines which came naturally to me, at the 
    beginning of this letter!</p>

    <p>In the end, &quot;curiouser and curiouser,&quot; she arrived at a practically
    identical conclusion: she believed, but what she believed in was Nothing!</p>

    <p>As to our old criterion of what we imply in practice when we say that
    we believe, she began by saying that If we &quot;helped&quot; God in His mysterious
    plan, He would in some fashion or other look after us.&nbsp; But about this
    she was even more vague than in the matter of intellectual conviction;
    &quot;helping God&quot; meant behaving decently according to one's own instinctive
    ideas of what &quot;decently&quot; means.</p>

    <p>It is very encouraging that she should have seen, without any prompting
    on my part, to what a muddle the question necessarily led; and very
    nice for me, because it lets me out, cara soror!</p>

    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.  I thought it a good plan to put my fundamental position all by
    itself in a postscript; to frame it.&nbsp; My observation of the Universe
    convinces me that there are beings of intelligence and power of a far
    higher quality than anything we can conceive of as human; that they are
    not necessarily based on the cerebral and nervous structures that we
    know; and that the one and only chance for mankind to advance as a
    whole is for individuals to make contact with such Beings.</p>
