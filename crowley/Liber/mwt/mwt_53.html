    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LIII: &quot;Mother-Love&quot;</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>You enthusiastically remark that the love of the mother for the off-spring
    is something that no man can understand: and you appear to prize it!</p>

    <p>Well, some men have had a jolly good shot at it, notably Emile Zola.&nbsp; The
    Usher goes into the corridor, and calls that name in strident and stentorian 
    tones.&nbsp; In he waddles, the squat obese bespectacled studious Jew,
    with the most devastating of all his thunderbolts under his arm&mdash;<em>La Terre</em>,
    and so what?</p>

    <p>&quot;How he will prologize, how he will perorate&quot; about:</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;The dewy musk-rose, mid-May's eldest child,<br>
      The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves!&quot;
    </blockquote>
    <p>He will not.</p>

    <p><em>La Terre</em> to him is indeed the mother of all men, sole source of our
    essential nourishment, the earth to which we are all bound in chains by
    our inexorable bodies, our ineluctable need of life&mdash;and death.</p>

    <p>Sublime the thesis?&nbsp; What does he make of it?&nbsp; Theme No. 1 in the first
    chapter: rural love.&nbsp; How exquisite, how delicate, first flush of dawn
    upon the glowing meadows!&nbsp; The young man who is courting is not idle,
    either; he serves great nature in yet other ways.&nbsp; He is taking a prize
    cow to be &quot;served:&quot; on him depend our milk, cheese, butter, veal and
    beef.&nbsp; He also contributes to our Wienerschnitzel Holstein, or Filet de
    Boeuf &agrave; la Robespierre, our Sole au Gratin and our oeufs &agrave; la Neige.</p>

    <p>So then, our rustic idyll!&nbsp; &quot;Rocked on the bosom of our Mother Nature.&quot;
    Longus paints Daphnis and Chloe, Whowasit draws &quot;Aucassin and Nicolette&quot;&mdash;why, 
    it's a root of literature itself all the way to Austin Dobson, Norman Gale and Thomas Hardy, 
    Theocritus&mdash;er&mdash;hum&mdash;not so much of &quot;Mother-love&quot; Trinacria way!</p>

    <p>Where Zola failed, who can hope to succeed?&nbsp; To distinguish between
    brute and brute: no, dear lady, that task I not regretfully relinquish!</p>

    <p>But in &quot;refined&quot; strata?&nbsp; That cock won't fight, O thou Aspirant to the
    Sacred Wisdom!&nbsp; It's very often worse; for under the anaesthetic, the
    most delicately-minded ladies of high social position and religious
    repute are apt to pour forth floods of filth which would disgust the
    coarsest harridans of slum-land!</p>

    <p>This is the final fact: so long as our life is bound to that of the
    animal and vegetable worlds, so that we are bondslaves born to their
    quite ineradicable habits, so long are we dragged back from every flight
    of fancy or imagination such as would break the chains that anchor us to
    mud.</p>

    <p>The most far-seeing of our prophetically minded writers, Aldous Huxley,
    brands this black fact upon our foreheads.</p>

    <p>The first condition of a &quot;Brave New World&quot; must be the dissociation of
    sexual from reproductive life.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp; The word &quot;mother&quot; 
    must be as nauseating to all properly human minds as it now is to every one that has 
    contemplated the subject with clear vision.</p>

    <p>I know there is an answer to all this; in fact, The Book of the Law</a>
    enables us to take it in our stride.</p>

    <p>But there is another aspect of &quot;mother-love&quot; which is urgent, practical,
    and in no way dependent upon ideal considerations.</p>

    <p>What do we find in practice as the immediate consequence of this &quot;sublime,&quot;
    this &quot;holy&quot; instinct?</p>

    <p>Quite a few species of animals habitually devour their offspring; but women 
    &quot;know a trick worth two of that.&quot;</p>

    <p>No, no, let Zola rhapsodize!</p>

    <p>Time passes.&nbsp; Libitina smiles.&nbsp; But the conditions are not spacious;
    both the &quot;happy events&quot;&mdash;real ladies and gentlemen emphasize this
    euphemism with a snigger and a smirk&mdash;are expected the same night,
    and the only place available is the barn.</p>

    <p>Now Zola, well into his stride, gives us full details, hopping from one
    corner of the barn to the other, so accurately and so judicially that
    the reader very soon &quot;loses his place,&quot; and doesn't know which birth is
    being described in any given paragraph.</p>

    <p>The accumulated hogwash of a billion sentimentalists dashes in vain
    against that cliff of ugly truth.</p>

    <p>Next witness: Dr. Doughty, who looked after the health of Trinity College, 
    Cambridge.</p>

    <p>A swift routine examination: then he tilted his chair backwards, thrust his hands 
    deep into his trousers pockets, fixed the patient with a glare of ice; then these 
    words dropped like vitriol from his lips: "You&mdash;young&mdash;fool!&nbsp; You 
    go and put the most tender part of your body where I wouldn't put my umbrella!&quot;</p>

    <p>It is the magical formula of a man to push outwards, of a woman to close
    upon from without.</p>

    <p>This is commonly seen as the possessive instinct: it may often be
    masked as &quot;protective&quot; but its essential truth is the impulse to devour.&nbsp;
    Hence the death-like idea of &quot;home,&quot; where she can digest her victims
    in security and at leisure.</p>

    <p>Hence, as even Jung saw in his very first book, and wrote in stated terms,
    the first task of manhood&mdash;of the &quot;hero&quot;&mdash;is to escape from the 
    mother.&nbsp; Now the son, with his male formula, his formula of life, his instinct 
    to push out, to break down all that would restrain him, finds it perfectly
    natural to &quot;bite the hand that fed him,&quot; as the complaint might piteously
    wail.&nbsp; But the daughter has no club to smash, no sword to cut; all she
    can hope to do is to pass the buck.&nbsp; The amoeba, born of fusion,<a href="#2">2</a>
    nourished by wrapping its pseudopods around such drifting particles as come within its scope, 
    is but a parasite on its own dam until the fusion is complete.</p>

    <p>So, when a woman is &quot;<em>so</em> good,&quot; &quot;<em>so</em> devoted to her daughter,&quot; 
    God help the daughter!</p>

    <p>She is never allowed to think for herself in the minutest matters; she
    is bound hand and foot remorselessly to the routine of her &quot;decent
    Christian home;&quot; a wageless kitchen-slut.&nbsp; No hope of escape unless the
    mother's vampirism takes the form of selling her off to the highest
    bidder.</p>

    <p>Need it be added that the &quot;good mother&quot; is usually quite unaware of all
    this, will read these simple statements of plain fact in speechless rage?</p>

    <p>But the truth stands: the woman-formula is Death: &quot;return to the Great
    Mother&quot; is the catastrophe of the hero, whether he be Coriolanus or Peer
    Gynt.</p>

    <p>It is surely unnecessary to state the rider to this theorem; so perhaps
    I had better:</p>

    <p>Anyone who has not totally and for ever destroyed in himself every vestige 
    of this instinct, extirpating every root and charring it with Fire, cannot 
    take the first step on the Path of the Wise.</p>

    <p>How nobly opposite is the Man-Formula!&nbsp; Its freight the wealth of the
    whole Universe, that splendid Argosy leaps free upon the glittering
    Ocean, to cast the very Soul of Life upon uncharted and enchanted isles!</p>

    <p>It is not to these few but well-chosen words that I propose to look to
    enhance my popularity in the Woman's Clubs of the United States.</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.&nbsp; &quot;Mother-Love&quot; is, of course, a branch of family affection 
    about which I have already written to you in no uncertain terms.&nbsp; Of all its
    sub-sections this is the worst because it is the strongest, the most natural, 
    that is to say, the most brutish.&nbsp; You have complained pathetically on 
    more than one occasion that I do not seem to know my own mind about Nature; 
    that I am always contradicting myself.&nbsp; Sometimes I tell you that everything 
    is in Nature; that everything moves by Nature: that to oppose Nature is to provoke 
    endothermic reaction, and then I leap headlong through the hoop of my own construction 
    and want you to defy nature, to attack her, to overcome her.&nbsp; Really, dear Master, 
    it is too bad of you!</p>

    <p>I know it sounds bad but there is not really the opposition that on the
    surface there seems to be.&nbsp; Perhaps it is that we are talking about two
    kinds of Nature.&nbsp; In one sense it might be asserted that the final for-
    mula of Nature is Inertia; in other words, that the dyad of manifested
    existence is an arbitrary and artificial development of the Zero to which
    everything must always cancel out.</p>

    <p>Now by saying that, we have to all intents and purposes, answered the
    question which it poses; all positive development must be a conflict
    with that Inertia.&nbsp; It is the opposition between the magical Path and
    the Mystical; we may therefore say fearlessly that all forms of progress, 
    although they make use of the formulae of nature which have brought
    them to their present situation, are attempts to proceed further on the
    way of the True Will.</p>

    <p>It is particularly important to understand this at the present time when
    the Aeon of Horus is just getting under way.&nbsp; For the Aeon of Isis, that
    of the Mother, appears to have regarded the whole of Nature as a spontaneous 
    growth of universal scope.&nbsp; In the Aeon Of Osiris, the restriction
    of Family appears for the first time.</p>

    <p>The world of sentient beings is separated into clusters, each family,
    clan, gens, or nation, acting as a unit and standing upon armed neutrality 
    with respect to similar groups.&nbsp; But in the Aeon of Horus this system
    has broken down.&nbsp; That such is the case is already abundantly manifest.</p>

    <p>Totalitarianism in any of its forms tends to break down the family structure.&nbsp;
    It considers only the Individual, and him, merely as a unit in the welter of the state.</p>

    <p>Experience will doubtless prove that this idea simply will not work.&nbsp; The 
    Individual will come to his own, but it will be impossible to reconstruct the Family System.</p>

    <p>It will in particular be impossible to maintain the intimate relation
    between Mother and Child, which has been so dominant a feature of past
    civilizations.</p>

    <p>The very social and economic causes which in the old time tended to
    cement the relationship, have become centrifugal in their effect.</p>

    <p id="1"><b>1</b>: It is by no means clear that Huxley saw the kind of society he 
    described in <em>Brave New World</em> as particularly desirable; and it is odd that 
    Crowley, given his scathing remarks on the subject of Utopias constructed on 
    <em>a priori</em> grounds (<em>vide</em> chapter 79, &quot;<a href="mwt_79.html">Progress</a>&quot; 
    should seem to endorse such things.&nbsp; In the &quot;New Comment&quot; on 
    AL I, 40</a> Crowley similarly quotes, apparently favourably 
    (in connection with the &quot;Three Grades&quot;) a proposal for a &quot;Rational State&quot; 
    outlined by a character in an earlier Huxley novel, <em>Crome Yellow</em> (the scheme in question 
    was in any case straight out of Plato's <em>Republic</em>); and yet in any such regulated society, 
    &quot;Irregularity, Eccentricity, Disorder, the Revolutionary Spirit, Experiment&quot; 
    are precisely those qualities which are stamped on, and hard &ndash; T.S.</p>
