    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter VI: The Three Schools of Magick (1)</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>
    
    <p>Here is the first section of M. Gerard Aumont's promised essay;<a href="#ac1">*</a> 
    it was originally called &quot;The Three Schools of Magick.&quot;&nbsp; (Don't be 
    cross, please, because it is not in the form of a personal letter!)</p>

    <p>There is today much misunderstanding of the meaning of the term &quot;Magick.&quot;
    Many attempts have been made to define it, but perhaps the best for our
    present purpose of historical-ideological exposition will be this&mdash;Magick 
    is the Science of the Incommensurables.</p>

    <p>This is one of the many restricted uses of the word; one suited to
    the present purpose.</p>

    <p>It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so often mixed up in the
    popular idea of a religion, has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; It is, in fact,
    the exact opposite of religion; it is, even more than Physical Science,
    its irreconcilable enemy.</p>

    <p>Let us define this difference clearly.</p>

    <p>Magick investigates the laws of Nature with the idea of making use of them.&nbsp; 
    It only differs from &quot;profane&quot; science by always keeping ahead of it.&nbsp; 
    As Fraser has shown, Magick is science in the tentative stage; but it may be, and 
    often is, more than this.&nbsp; It is science which, for one reason or another, 
    cannot be declared to the profane.</p>

    <p>Religion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore the laws of Nature, or to
    escape them by appeal to a postulated power which is assumed to have
    laid them down.&nbsp; The religious man is, as such, incapable of understanding 
    what the laws of Nature really are.&nbsp; (They are generalizations from
    the order of observed fact.)</p>

    <p>The History of Magick has never been seriously attempted.&nbsp; For one
    reason, only initiates pledged to secrecy know much about it; for
    another, every historian has been talking about some more or less 
    conventional idea of Magick, not of the thing itself.&nbsp; But Magick has 
    led the world from before the beginning of history, if only for the reason
    that Magick has always been the mother of Science.&nbsp; It is, therefore,
    of extreme importance that some effort should be made to understand
    something of the subject; and there is, therefore, no apology necessary
    for essaying this brief outline of its historical aspects.</p>

    <hr>
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> A few amendments&mdash;very few&mdash;have been necessitated 
    by the lapse of time.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <p>There have always been, at least in nucleus, three main Schools of
    Philosophical practice.&nbsp; (We use the word &quot;philosophical&quot; in 
    the old good broad sense, as in the phrase &quot;Philosophical Transactions 
    of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Knowledge.&quot;)</p>

    <p>It is customary to describe these three Schools as Yellow, Black, and
    White.&nbsp; The first thing necessary is to warn the reader that they must
    by no means be confounded with racial distinctions of colour; and they
    correspond still less with conventional symbols such as yellow caps,
    yellow robes, black magick, white witchcraft, and the like.&nbsp; The danger
    is only the greater that these analogies are often as alluring as the
    prove on examination to be misleading.</p>

    <p>These Schools represent three perfectly distinct and contrary theories
    of the Universe, and, therefore, practices of spiritual science.&nbsp; The
    magical formula of each is as precise as a theorem of trigonometry.&nbsp;
    Each assumes as fundamental a certain law of Nature, and the subject is
    complicated by the fact that each School, in a certain sense, admits the
    formul&aelig; of the other two.&nbsp; It merely regards them as in some way 
    incomplete, secondary, or illusory.&nbsp; Now, as will be seen later, the Yellow
    School stand aloof from the other two by the nature of its postulates.&nbsp; But 
    the Black School and the White are always more or less in active conflict; and 
    it is because just at this moment that conflict is approaching a climax that it 
    is necessary to write this essay.&nbsp; The adepts of the White School consider 
    the present danger to mankind so great that they are prepared to abandon their 
    traditional policy of silence, in order to enlist in their ranks the profane of 
    every nation.</p>

    <p>We are in possession of a certain mystical document<a href="#ed1">*</a> which we may
    describe briefly, for convenience sake, as an Apocalypse of which we
    hold the keys, thanks to the intervention of the Master who has appeared
    at this grave conjuncture of Fate.&nbsp; This document consists of a series
    of visions, in which we hear the various Intelligences whose nature it
    would be hard to define, but who are at the very least endowed with
    knowledge and power far beyond anything that we are accustomed to regard
    as proper to the human race.</p>

    <p>We must quote a passage from one of the most important of these documents.&nbsp;
    The doctrine is conveyed, as is customary among Initiates, in the form of a 
    parable.&nbsp; Those who have attained even a mediocre degree of enlightenment 
    are aware that the crude belief of the faithful, and the crude infidelity of 
    the scoffer, with regard to matters of fact, are merely childish.&nbsp; Every 
    incident in Nature, true or false, possesses a spiritual significance.&nbsp; 
    It is this significance, and only this significance, that possesses any 
    philosophical value to the Initiate.</p>

    <p>The orthodox need not be shocked, and the enlightened need not be contemptuous, 
    to learn that the passage which we are about to quote, is a parable based on 
    the least decorous of the Biblical legends which refer to Noah.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp;
    It simply captures for its own purposes the convenience of Scripture.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>(Here follows the excerpt from the Vision.)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of
      the Most High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the
      adepts.&nbsp; And BABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and 
      she hath fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called her children
      together saying: Come up with me, and let us make a mock of the nakedness 
      of the Most High.</p>

      <p>And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking
      backwards, and was white.&nbsp; And the second of the adepts covered his
      shame with a cloth, walking sideways, and was yellow.&nbsp; And the third 
      of the adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walking forwards, and was 
      black.&nbsp; And these are the three great schools of the Magi, who are also 
      the three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not
      wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if the three
      schools be not one.<a href="#ac2">*</a></p>

      <hr>
      <p id="ac2"><b>*</b> This doctrine of the Three Schools is of extreme interest.&nbsp; 
      Roughly, it may be said that the White is the Pure Mystic, whose attitude to God is 
      one of reverence.&nbsp; The Yellow School conceals the Mysteries indeed, but examines 
      them as it goes along.&nbsp; The Black School is that of pure Scepticism.<a href="#3">3</a></p>
      <hr>

    </blockquote>
      
    <p>We are now ready to study the philosophical bases of these three Schools.</p>

    <p>We must, however, enter a caveat against too literal an interpretation,
    even of the parable.&nbsp; It may be suspected, for reasons which should be
    apparent after further investigation of the doctrines of the Three
    Schools, that this parable was invented by an Intelligence of the Black
    School, who was aware of his iniquity, and thought to transform it into
    righteousness by the alchemy of making a boast of it.&nbsp; The intelligent
    reader will note the insidious attempt to identify the doctrine of the
    Black School with the kind of black magic that is commonly called
    Diabolism.&nbsp; In other words, this parable is itself an example of an
    exceedingly subtle black magical operation, and the contemplation of
    such devices carried far enough beings us to an understanding of the
    astoundingly ophidian processes of Magicians.&nbsp; Let not the profane
    reader dismiss such subtleties from his mind as negligible nonsense.
    It is cunning of this kind that determines the price of potatoes.</p>

    <p>The above digression is perhaps not so inexcusable as it may seem on a
    first reading.  Careful study of it should reveal the nature of the
    thought-processes which are habitually used by the secret Masters of
    the human race to determine its destiny.</p>

    <p>When everyone has done laughing, I will ask you to compare the real
    effects produced on the course of human affairs by Caesar, Attila, and
    Napoleon, on the one hand; of Plato, the Encyclopaedists, and Karl Marx<a href="#ac3">*</a>
    on the other.</p>

    <p>The Yellow School of Magick considers, with complete scientific and
    philosophical detachment, the fact of the Universe as a fact.&nbsp; Being
    itself apart of that Universe, it realizes its impotence to alter the
    totality in the smallest degree.&nbsp; To put it vulgarly, it does not try to
    raise itself from the ground by pulling at its socks.&nbsp; It therefore
    opposes to the current of phenomena no reaction either of hatred or of
    sympathy.&nbsp; So far as it attempts to influence the course of events at
    all, it does so in the only intelligent way conceivable.&nbsp; It seeks to
    diminish internal friction.</p>

    <p>It remains, therefore, in a contemplative attitude.&nbsp; To use the terms
    of Western philosophy, there is in its attitude something of the stoicism
    of Zeno; or of the Pickwickianism, if I may use the term, of Epicurus.&nbsp;
    The ideal reaction to phenomena is that of perfect elasticity.&nbsp; It
    possesses something of the cold-bloodedness of mathematics; and for
    this reason it seems fair to say, for the purposes of elementary study,
    that Pythagoras is its most adequate exponent in European philosophy.</p>

    <p>Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, however, we have no need to
    take our ideas at second-hand.&nbsp; The Yellow School of Magick possesses
    one perfect classic.&nbsp; The <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em>.<a href="#ac4">&#134;</a></p>

    <p>It is impossible to find any religion which adequately represents the
    thought of this masterpiece.&nbsp; Not only is religion as such repugnant 
    to science and philosophy, but from the very nature of the tenets of the
    Yellow School, its adherents are not going to put themselves to any
    inconvenience for the enlightenment of a lot of people whom they consider
    to be hopeless fools.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the theory of religion, as such, being a tissue of
    falsehood, the only real strength of any religion is derived from its
    pilferings of Magical doctrine; and, religious persons being by defini-
    tion entirely unscrupulous, it follows that any given religion is likely
    to contain scraps of Magical doctrine, filched more or less haphazard
    from one school or the other as occasion serves.</p>

    <p>Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriously of trying to get a grasp 
    of this subject by means of siren analogies.&nbsp; Taoism has as little to 
    do with the <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em> as the Catholic Church with the Gospel.</p>

    <p>The <em>Tao Teh</em> K<em>ing</em> inculcates conscious inaction, or rather unconscious
    inaction, with the object of minimizing the disorder of the world.&nbsp; A
    few quotations from the text should make the essence of the doctrine clear.<a href="#4">4</a></p>
