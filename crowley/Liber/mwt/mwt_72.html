    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXII: Education</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Education means &quot;leading out&quot;; this is not the same as &quot;stuffing in.&quot;</p>

    <p>I refuse to enlarge on this theme; it is all-important.&nbsp; To extract
    something, you should first know what is there.&nbsp; Here astrology ought
    to give useful hints; its indications give the mind something to work
    on.&nbsp; Experience makes &quot;confirmation strong as Holy Writ;&quot; but beware
    of <em>&agrave; priori</em>.  Do not be dogmatic; do not insist in the face of 
    disappointment.&nbsp; Astrology in education is useful as geology is to the
    prospector; it tells you the sort of thing to look for, and the direction 
    in which to explore.</p>

    <p>There are, however, two main lines of teaching which are of universal
    value to normal children; it is hardly possible to begin too early.</p>

    <p>Firstly, accustom his ear from the start to noble sounds; the music
    of nature and the rhythm of great poetry.&nbsp; Do not aim at his understand-
    ing, but at his subconscious mind.&nbsp; Protect him from cacophonous noise;
    avoid scoring any cheap success with him by inflicting jingles; do not
    insult him by &quot;baby-talk.&quot;</p>

    <p>Secondly, let him understand, as soon as you start actual teaching, the
    difference between the real and the conventional in what you make him
    memorize.&nbsp; Nothing irritates children more than the arbitrary &quot;because
    I say so.&quot;</p>

    <p>Nobody knows why the alphabet has the order which we know; it is quite
    senseless.&nbsp; One could construct a much more rational order: <em>e.g.</em> the
    Mother, the Single and the Double letters, all in the natural order of
    the elements, planets and signs.&nbsp; Again, we have the &quot;Missionary&quot; 
    Alphabet, arranged &quot;scientifically&quot; as Gutturals, modified ditto, 
    Dentals, Labials, vowels and so on; a most repulsive concoction!&nbsp; But I would
    not accept any emendation from the God Thoth himself; it is infinitely
    simpler to stick to the familiar order.&nbsp; But explain to the child that
    this is only for convenience, like the rule of the road; indeed, like
    almost any rules!</p>

    <p>But when your teaching is of the disputable kind, explain that too;
    encourage him to question, to demand a reason and to disagree.  Get him
    to fence with you; sharpen his wits by dialectic; lure him into thinking 
    for himself.&nbsp; I want tricks which will show him the advantages of a
    given subject of study; make him pester you to teach him.&nbsp; We did this
    most successfully at the Abbey of Thelema in Cefalu; let me give you an
    instance: reading.&nbsp; One of us would take the children shopping and bring
    up the subject of ice-cream.&nbsp; Where, oh where could we get some?
    Presently one would exclaim and point to a placard and say, &quot;I really
    do believe there'll be some there&quot;&mdash;and lo! it was so.&nbsp; Then 
    they would wonder how one knew, and one would say: Why, there's &quot;Helados&quot;
    printed on that piece of card in the window.&nbsp; They would want to learn
    to read at once.&nbsp; We would discourage them, saying what hard work it
    was, and how much crying it cost, at the same time giving another demonstration 
    of the advantages.  They would insist, and we should yield&mdash;to active, 
    eager children, not to dullards that hated the idea of &quot;lessons.&quot;&nbsp; 
    So with pretty well everything; we first excited the child's will in the desired 
    direction.</p>

    <p>But (you ask) are there any special branches of learning which you
    regard as essential for all?</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>Our old unvalued friend St. Paul, the cunning crook who turned the
    Jewish communism of the Apostles into an international ramp, saw in a
    vision a man from Macedonia who said &quot;Come over and help us!&quot;&nbsp; This
    time it has been a woman from California, but the purport of her plaints
    was identical.  Much as I should like to see my Father the Sun once more
    before I die, nothing doing until&mdash;if ever&mdash;life recovers from the
    blight of regulations.&nbsp; Luckily, one thing she said helps us out: someone 
    had told her that I had written on Education in <em>Liber Aleph</em>&mdash;<em>The
    Book of Wisdom or Folly</em>&mdash;which has been ready for the printer for more
    than a quarter of a century&mdash;and there's nothing I can do about it!</p>

    <p>However, I looked up the typescript.  The book is itself Education;
    there are, however, six chapters which treat of the subject in the
    Special sense in which your question has involved us.</p>

    <p>So I shall fling these chapters headlong into this letter.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4 align="center">DE VOLUNTATE JUVENUM<a href="#1">1</a></h4>

      <p>Long, O my Son, hath been this Digression from the plain Path of
      My word concerning Children; but it was most needful that thou
      shouldst understand the Limits of true Liberty.&nbsp; For that is not
      the Will of any Man which ultimateth in his own Ruin and that of
      all his Fellows; and that is not Liberty whose Exercise bringeth
      him to Bondage.&nbsp; Thou mayst therefore assume that it is always an
      essential Part of the Will of any Child to grow to Manhood or to
      Womanhood in Health, and his Guardians may therefore prevent him
      from ignorantly acting in Opposition thereunto, Care being always
      taken to remove the cause of the Error, namely, Ignorance, as
      aforesaid.&nbsp; Thou mayst also assume that it is Part of the Child's
      Will to train every Function of the Mind; and the Guardians may
      therefore combat the Inertia which hinders its Development.&nbsp; Yet
      here is much Caution necessary, and it is better to work by
      exciting and satisfying any natural Curiosity than by forcing
      Application to set Tasks, however obvious this Necessity may
      appear.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DE MODO DISPUTANDI<a href="#2">2</a></h4>

      <p>Now in this training of the Child is one most dear Consideration,
      that I shall impress upon thee as is Conformity with out holy
      Experience in the way of Truth.&nbsp; And it is this, that since that
      which can be thought is not true, every Statement is in some sense
      false.&nbsp; Even on the Sea of Pure Reason, we may say that every
      Statement is in some Sense disputable.&nbsp; Therefore in every Case,
      even the simplest, the Child should be taught not only the Thesis,
      but also its opposite, leaving the Decision to the child's own
      Judgment and good Sense, fortified by Experience.&nbsp; And this Practice 
      will develop its Power of Thought, and its Confidence in itself, and 
      its Interest in all Knowledge.&nbsp; But most of all beware against 
      any Attempt to bias its Mind on any Point that lieth without the Square 
      of ascertained and undisputed Fact.&nbsp; Remember also,
      even when thou art most sure, that so were they sure who gave
      Instruction to the young Copernicus.&nbsp; Pay Reverence also to the
      Unknown unto whom thou presumest to impart thy knowledge; for he may
      be one greater than thou.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DE VOLUTATE JUVENIS COGNOSCENDA<a href="#3">3</a></h4>

      <p>It is important that thou shouldst understand as early as may be
      what is the true Will of the Child in the Matter of his Career.&nbsp;
      Be thou well aware of all Ideals and Daydreams; for the Child is
      himself, and not thy Toy.&nbsp; Recall the comic Tragedy of Napoleon
      and the King of Rome; build not an House for a wild Goat, nor
      plant a Forest for the Domain of a Shark.&nbsp; But be thou vigilant
      for every Sign, conscious or unconscious, of the Will of the Child,
      giving him then all Opportunity to pursue the Path which he thus
      indicates.&nbsp; Learn this, that he, being young, will weary quickly
      of all false Ways, however pleasant they may be to him at the Outset; 
      but of the true Way he will not weary.&nbsp; This being in this
      Manner discovered, thou mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for
      no man can keep all Roads open for ever.&nbsp; And to him making his
      Choice explain how one may not travel far on any one Road without
      a general Knowledge of Things apparently irrelevant.&nbsp; And with
      that he will understand, and bend him wisely to his Work.</p>

      <h4 align="center">DE ARTE MENTIS COLENDI&nbsp; (1) MATHEMATICA<a href="#4">4</a></h4>

      <p>Now, concerning the first Foundation of Thy Mind I will say
      somewhat.&nbsp; Thou shalt study with Diligence in the Mathematics,
      because thereby shall be revealed unto thee the Laws of thine own
      Reason and the Limitations thereof.&nbsp; This Science manifesteth unto
      thee thy true Nature in respect of the Machinery whereby it worketh,
      and showeth in pure Nakedness, without Clothing of Personality or
      Desire, the Anatomy of thy conscious Self.&nbsp; Furthermore, by this
      thou mayst understand the Essence of the Relations between all
      Things, and the Nature of Necessity, and come to the Knowledge of
      Form.&nbsp; For this Mathematics is as it were the last Veil before the
      Image of Truth, so that there is no Way better than our Holy
      Qabalah, which analyseth all Things soever, and reduceth them
      to pure Number; and thus their Natures being no longer coloured
      and confused, they may be regulated and formulated in Simplicity
      by the Operation of Pure Reason, to their great Comfort in the
      Work of our Transcendental Art, whereby the Many become One.</p>

      <h4 align="center">SEQUITUR&nbsp; (2) CLASSICA<a href="#5">5</a></h4>

      <p>My son, neglect not in any wise the study of the Writings of
      Antiquity, and that in the original Language.&nbsp; For by this thou
      shalt discover the History of the Structure of thy Mind, that is,
      its Nature regarded as the last Term in a Sequence of Causes and
      Effects.&nbsp; For thy Mind hath been built up of these Elements, so
      that in these Books thou mayst bring into the Light thine own
      sub-conscious Memories.&nbsp; And thy Memory is as it were the Mortar
      in the House of thy Mind, without which is no Cohesion or Individuality 
      possible, so that it is called Dementia.&nbsp; And these Books have 
      lived long and become famous because they are the Fruits of ancient 
      Trees whereof thou art directly the Heir, wherefore (say I) they 
      are more truly germane to thine own Nature than Books of Collateral 
      Offshoots, though such were in themselves better and wiser.&nbsp; 
      Yes, O my son, in these Writings thou mayst study to come to the 
      true Comprehension of thine own Nature, and that of the whole 
      Universe, in the dimensions of Time, even as the Mathematic declareth 
      it in that of Space: that is, of Extension.&nbsp; Moreover, by this 
      Study shall the Child comprehend the Foundation of Manners: the which, 
      as sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom, maketh Man.</p>

      <h4 align="center">SEQUITUR&nbsp; (3) SCIENTIFICA<a href="#6">6</a></h4>

      <p>Since Time and Space are the conditions of Mind, these two
      Studies are fundamental.&nbsp; Yet there remaineth Causality, which
      is the Root of the Actions and Reactions of Nature.&nbsp; This also
      shalt thou seek ardently, that thou mayest comprehend the
      Variety of the Universe, its Harmony and its Beauty, with the
      Knowledge of that which compelleth it.&nbsp; Yet this is not equal
      to the former two in Power to reveal thee to thyself; and its
      first Use is to instruct thee in the true Method of Advancement
      in Knowledge, which is, fundamentally, the observation of the
      Like and Unlike.&nbsp; Also, it shall arouse in thee the Ecstasy
      of Wonder; and it shall bring thee to a proper Understanding
      of Art Magick.&nbsp; For our Magick is but one of the Powers that
      lie within us undeveloped and unanalysed; and it is by the
      Method of Science that it must be made clear, and available to
      the Use of Man.&nbsp; Is not this a Gift beyond Price, the Fruit
      of a Tree not only of Knowledge but of Life?&nbsp; For there is that
      in Man which is God, and there is that also which is Dust; and
      by our Magick we shall make these twain one Flesh, to the Obtaining 
      of the Empery of the Universe.</p>
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>I suppose I might have put it more concisely:  Classics is itself
    Initiation, being the key of the Unconscious; Mathematics is the Art
    of manipulating the Ruach, and of raising it to Neschamah; and Science
    is co-terminous with Magick.</p>

    <p>These are the three branches of study which I regard as fundamental.
    No others are in the same class.  For instance, Geography is almost
    meaningless until one makes it real by dint of honest travel, which
    does not mean either &quot;commuting&quot; or &quot;luxury cruises,&quot; 
    still less &quot;globe-trotting.&quot;&nbsp; Law is a specialized study, 
    with a view to a career; History is too unsystematic and uncertain to be 
    of much use as mental training; Art is to be studied for and by one's 
    solitary self; any teaching soever is rank poison.</p>

    <p>The final wisdom on this subject is perhaps the old &quot;Something of
    everything, and everything of something.&quot;</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours ever,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S.  Better mention, perhaps, that literacy is no test of education.
    For ignorance of life, the don class leaves all others at the post;
    and it is these monkish and monkeyish recluses, with their hideous
    clatter and cackle, &quot;The tittering, thin-bearded, epicene,&quot; 
    &quot;Dwarf, fringed with fear,&quot; the obscene vole, dweller by and in 
    backwaters that has foisted upon us the grotesque and poisonous superstition
    that wisdom abides only in dogs-eared, worm-eaten, mule-inspired
    long-forgotten as misbegotten folios.</p>

    <p>I like the story&mdash;it is a true tale&mdash;of the old Jew millionaire who
    bought up the annual waste of the Pennsylvania Railroad&mdash;a matter of
    Three Million Dollars.  He called with his cheque very neatly made out&mdash;and 
    signed it by making his mark!&nbsp; The Railroad Man was naturally flabbergasted, 
    and could not help exclaiming, &quot;Yet you made all those
    millions of yours&mdash;what would you have been if only you had been able
    to read and write?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Doorkeeper at the Synagogue&quot; was 
    the prompt reply.&nbsp; His illiteracy had disqualified him when he applied for the
    job after landing.</p>

    <p>The story is not only true, but &quot;of all Truth;&quot; see 
    <a href="mwt_29.html">my previous letter</a> on &quot;Certainty.&quot;</p>

    <p>Books are not the only medium even of learning; more, what they teach
    is partial, prejudiced, meagre, sterile, uncertain, and alien to
    reality.&nbsp; It follows that all the best books are those which make no
    pretence to accuracy: poetry, theatre, fiction.&nbsp; All others date.&nbsp;
    Another point is that Truth abides above and aloof from intellectual
    expression, and consequently those books which bear the Magic Keys
    of the Portal of the Intelligible by dint of inspiration and suggestion
    come more nearly to grips with Reality than those whose appeal is only
    to the Intellect.&nbsp; &quot;Didactic&quot; poetry, &quot;realistic&quot; 
    plays and novels, are contradictions in terms.</p>

    <p>P.P.S. One more effort: the above reminds me that I have said no
    word about the other side of the medal.&nbsp; There are many children who
    cannot be educated at all in any sense of the word.  It is an abonin-
    able waste of both of them and of the teacher to push against brick
    walls.</p>

    <p>Yet one last point.&nbsp; I am as near seventy as makes no matter, and I
    am still learning with all my might.&nbsp; All my life I have been taught:
    governesses, private tutors, schools, private and public, the best of
    the Universities: how little I know!&nbsp; I have traveled all over the
    world in all conditions, from &quot;grand seigneur,&quot; to &quot;holy 
    man;&quot; how little I know!</p>

    <p>What then of the ninety-and-nine, dragged by the ears through suicide
    examinations, and kicked out of school into factory in their teens?&nbsp;
    They have learnt only just enough to facilitate the swallowing of the
    gross venal lies of the radio and the Yellow Press; or, if mother-wit 
    has chanced to warn them, they learn a little&mdash;very little&mdash;more, 
    getting their Science from a Shilling Handbook and so on, till
    they know just enough to become dangerous agitators.</p>

    <p>No, anything like a real education demands leisure, the conversation
    of the wise, the means to travel, and the rest.</p>

    <p>There is only one solution: to pick out the diamonds from the clay,
    cut them, polish them, and set them as they deserve.&nbsp; Attempt no idiot
    experiments with the muck of the mine!&nbsp; You will observe that I am
    advocating an aristocratic revolution.&nbsp; And so I am!</p>

    <p>P.P.P.S.  Short of the ideals above outlined, you may as well have
    a <em>pis aller</em>&mdash;words of astonishing insight and wisdom, not alien to
    the Law Thelema, and written by one who was trained on <em>The Book of the Law</em>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Self-confidence must be cultivated in the younger members of
      the nation from childhood onwards.  Their whole education and
      training must be directed towards giving them a conviction that
      they are superior to others&quot;, wrote Hitler.</p>

      <p>&quot;In the case of female education,&quot; I read on, &quot;the main stress
      should be laid on bodily training, after that on character, and,
      last of all, on the intellect; but the one absolute aim of female
      education must be with a view to the future mother.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>They are quoted as an extreme example of all that is horrible and evil
    by Mr. George E. Chust of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>&mdash;from <em>Mein Kampf</em>!</p>

    <p>P.P.P.P.S.  There is a game, an improvement on the &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;&mdash;I
    have anti-christened it "Fore and aft" so as to be natty and naval&mdash;which 
    is in my opinion one of the three or four best indoor games for
    two ever invented.&nbsp; Here are the rules, in brief: any disputed points?
    Apply to me.</p>

    <p>1.&nbsp; A &quot;Word&quot; consists of four or more letters.</p>

    <p>2.&nbsp; It must be printed in big black type in the Dictionary chosen for
    reference.&nbsp; (Nuttall's is fairly good, though some very well-known
    words are omitted.&nbsp; The <em>Oxford Pocket Dictionary</em> is useless; it is
    for morons, illiterates, wallowers in &quot;Basic English&quot;&mdash;and [I suppose]
    Oxonians.&nbsp; No proper names, however well-known, unless used as common:
    e.g. Bobby, a flatfoot, a beetlecrusher, a harness bull; or Xantippe, a shrew, a 
    lady.&nbsp; X-rays is given in the plural only: ditto &quot;Rontgen-rays&quot;, 
    and they give &quot;Rontgenogram&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;You never can tell!&quot;&nbsp; 
    Participles, plurals and the like are not &quot;words&quot; unless printed as such in 
    big black type.&nbsp; E.g. Nuttall's &quot;Juttingly&quot; is a word; &quot;jutting&quot; 
    is not, being in smaller type.&nbsp; &quot;Soaking&quot; is in small type, but also in big
    type as a noun; so it is a word.)</p>

    <p>3.&nbsp; The Dictionary is the sole and final arbiter.&nbsp; This produces blasphemy, 
    but averts assassination.</p>

    <p>4.&nbsp; The first player starts with the letter A.&nbsp; The second may put any
    letter he chooses either before or after that A.&nbsp; The other continues
    as he will, and can.</p>

    <p>5.&nbsp; The player who cannot add a letter without completing a &quot;word&quot; loses.</p>

    <p>They proceed to B, and so on to Z.</p>

    <p>6.&nbsp; A player whose turn it is must either add his letter within a
    reasonable (This is a matter of good feeling, courtesy and consideration) 
    time, may say &quot;I challenge&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;That is a 'word'.&quot;
    The other must then give the &quot;word&quot; that he intends, or deny that it
    is a &quot;word&quot; within the meaning of the Art, as the case may be.&nbsp; The
    Dictionary decides the winner.&nbsp; The challenged player may give one
    word only, and that in the form which is printed in the Dictionary;
    e.g. if he were challenged at BRUSS, and answered Brussels, he would
    lose; if BRUSSELS-SPROUTS, he would win.  Hyphens need not be given.
    CASHMERE is a &quot;word&quot;; it is a kind of shawl, etc., so is CHARLEY, a
    night-watchman.&nbsp; Don't argue: the Dictionary decides.</p>

    <p>7.&nbsp; This game calls not only for an extensive vocabulary but for courage;
    foresight, judgment, resource, subtlety and even low cunning.&nbsp; It can
    be played by more than two players, but the more there are, the more
    the element of chance comes in; and this is hateful to really fine
    players and diminishes the excitement.&nbsp; The rapier-play of two experts,
    when a word changes from one line of formation to another, and then
    again, perhaps even a third time, is as exhilarating as a baseball-game 
    or a bull-fight.</p>

    <p>And what the Tartarus-Tophet-Jehanna has all this to do with Education,
    and the Great Work?&nbsp; This, child!&nbsp; H. G. Wells and others have pointed
    out with serene justice that a gap in your vocabulary implies a gap in
    your mind; you lack the corresponding idea.&nbsp; Too true, &quot;Erbert!&nbsp; 
    But I threap that a pakeha with such xerotes as his will chowter with an
    arsis of ischonophony, beyond aught that any fub, even in Vigonia and
    dwale mammodis with a cascade from a Dewan tauty, a kiss-me-quick, a
    chou over her merkin and a parka over her chudder could do to save
    him, and have an emprosthotonos, when he reads this.&nbsp; Sruti!</p>

    <p>(Whaur's your Wullie Chaucer noo?)</p>

    <p>I put this in for you because an American officer,<a href="#7">7</a> very dear to 
    me, flited from the Front for a few days to ask me a few questions&mdash;oh,
    &quot;very much above your exalted grade&quot; my dear&mdash;and I thought it might
    be useful to him to learn this game, needing, as it does, such very
    meagre apparatus, to wile away some of the long hours between attacks.&nbsp;
    He picked it up quickly enough; but, after a bit when I suggested
    that he should pass it on to his comrades-in-arms, he jeered at me openly!</p>

    <p>Their vocabulary to mine, he said, holds just about the same proportion
    as mine does to yours; I hypothesized modestly, &quot;about five per cent.&quot;
    (After all, I am forty-five years his senior.)&nbsp; He roared at me.&nbsp; &quot;Not
    one in a hundred,&quot; he said, &quot;know so much as the names of nine-tenths
    of the subjects that I discuss habitually and fluently.&nbsp; They gasp,
    they gape, they grunt, the gibber; it is almost always black bewilderment.*&nbsp; 
    And some of them are college graduates&mdash;which I'm not.&quot;</p>

    <p>He was snatched from school, and given a commission on the spot, apparently 
    because he was one of very few that could be differentiated from
    the average Learned Pig.</p>

    <p>All this made me exceeding sorrowful.  I began to understand why my
    Liber OZ</a>, written entirely in words 
    of one syllable only, with this very idea in mind, turned out to be 
    completely beyond the average man's (or woman's) understanding.&nbsp;
