    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXIV: Obstacles on the Path</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>Peccavi!&nbsp; And how!&nbsp; But my excuse is good, and I will try to make amends.</p>

    <p>First, a little counter-attack&mdash;your letter is so rambling and diffuse
    that at first I couldn't make out what you were getting at, and at last
    decided that it is much too random to reproduce, or even to deal with
    in detail.&nbsp; I shall simply formulate the case for the Prosecution, plead
    guilty, and appeal for clemency.</p>

    <p>The gravamen is that the Path of the Wise is gay with flowers, gilded
    with kiosks, and beset with snares; that every step is the Abode of
    Terror and Rapture&mdash;and all that!&nbsp; Yet I habitually write in the manner
    of a drunken dominie!&nbsp; You &quot;gaped for Aeschylus, and got Theognis.&quot;</p>

    I tempted you, it seems with <em>The Chymical Marriage of Christian
    Rosencreutz</em>, its incomparable mystery and glamour, its fugitive
    beauty, its ineffable romance, its chivalry and its adventure, pellucid
    gleams as of sunlight under the sea, vast brooding wings of horror
    overshadowing the firmament, yet with strong Starlight constant over-
    bead.&nbsp; And then I let you down!

    <p>You did expect at least something of the atmosphere of the <em>Arabian
    Nights</em>; if not so high, of Apuleius and <em>Petronius Arbiter</em>; of Rabelais,
    Meinhold, de la Motte Fouqu&eacute;; and the <em>Morte d'Arthur</em> in later times, of
    Balzac, Dumas, Lytton, Huysmans, Mabel Collins and Arthur Machen.</p>

    <p>You look at me with strange sad eyes: &quot;But you, too, Master, have not
    you too led a life as strange, as glamourous, as weird and as romantic,
    as the best of them?&nbsp; Then why this cold detachment from that ambience?&quot;
    Well, if you put it like that, I can only say that I feel at the same
    time more guilty and entirely innocent!</p>

    <p>For, while the charge is true, the defence is not to be shaken.</p>

    <p>The worst of all teachers are the Boloney Magnates, of whom I have
    already given some account.&nbsp; But the next worst are just exactly those
    who try to create an atmosphere of romance, and succeed only in a crude
    theatricalism.&nbsp; So, avoiding the swirling turmoil of Scylla, I have
    broken the ship on the barren rock Charybdis.<a href="#1">1</a></p>


    <p>Now let me hearten you, brave sister!&nbsp; All the old tales are true!
    You can have as many dragons, princesses, vampires, knights-errant,
    glendowers, enchanted apes, Jinn, sorcerers and incubi as you like to
    fancy, and&mdash;whoa Emma! did I tell you about Cardinal Newman?&nbsp; Well,
    I will.</p>

    <p>The one passage in his snivelling Apologia which impressed me was a
    tale of his childhood&mdash;before the real poet, lover and mystic had
    been buried beneath the dung-heap of Theology.&nbsp; He tells us that he
    read the <em>Arabian Nights</em>&mdash;in a heavily Bowdlerized edition, bet you
    a tosser!&mdash;and was enchanted, like the rest of us, so that he sighed
    &quot;I wish these tales were true!&quot;&nbsp; The same thing happened to me; but
    I set my teeth, and muttered: &quot;I will <em>make</em> these tales true!&quot;</p>

    <p>Well, I have, haven't I?&nbsp; You said it yourself!</p>

    <p>Let me be very frank about one point.&nbsp; It has always puzzled me completely 
    why one is forbidden to relate certain of one's adventures.&nbsp; You remember, 
    perhaps, in one of these letters I started out gaily to tell you some quite simple 
    things&mdash;I couldn't, can't, see quite what harm could come of it&mdash;and I 
    was pulled up sharp&mdash;yes, and actually punished, like a school-boy!&nbsp; 
    I had often done much more impudent things, and nobody seemed to give a hoot.&nbsp; 
    Oh somebody tell me why!</p>

    <p>The only suggestion that occurs to me is that I might somehow be
    &quot;giving occasion to the enemy to blaspheme.&quot;&nbsp; Let it go at that!
    &quot;Enough of Because!&nbsp; Be he damned for a dog!&quot;</p>

    <p>Yes child, my deepest attitude is to be found in my life.&nbsp; I have been
    to most of the holy inaccessible places, and talked with the most holy
    inaccessible men; I have dared all the most dangerous adventures, both
    of the flesh and of the spirit; and I challenge the world's literature
    to match for sublimity and terror such experiences as those in the
    latter half of <em>The Vision and the Voice</em>.</p>

    <p>You understand, of course, that I say all this merely in indication;
    or rather, as I said before, as an appeal for clemency.</p>

    <p>On the contrary (you will retort) you are a mean cat (Felis Leo,
    please!) not to let us all in on the ground floor of so imposing a
    Cathedral!</p>

    <p>To atone?&nbsp; Not a catalogue, which would be interminable; not a classification, 
    which would be impossible, save in the roughest terms; nothing but a few short notes, 
    possibly an anecdote or so.&nbsp; Just a tickle or a dram of schnapps, to enliven the 
    proceedings&mdash;ordeals&mdash;temptations&mdash;that sort of thing.&nbsp; 
    A general Khabardar karo!&nbsp; With now and then a snappy Achtung!</p>

    <p>Oh, curse this mind of mine!  I just can't help running to hide under
    the broad skirts of the Qabalah!  It's Disk, Sword, Cup and Wand again!
    Sorry, but <em>c'est trop fort pour moi</em>.</p>

    <p>Disks.&nbsp; To master Earth, remember that the Disk is always spinning;
    fix this idea, get rid of its solidity.</p>

    <p>Commonly, the first tests of the young Aspirant refer to cash&mdash;&quot;that's
    God's sol solid in this world.&quot;&nbsp; The proper magical attitude is very
    hard to describe.&nbsp; (I'm not talking of that black hen's egg any more;
    that is simple.)&nbsp; Very sorry to have to say it, but it is not unlike
    that of the spendthrift.&nbsp; Money must circulate, or it loses its true
    value.&nbsp; A banker in New York once told me that the dollar circulated
    nine times as fast as the English equivalent, so that people seemed
    to themselves to be nine times as rich.&nbsp; (I told you about the &pound;100
    note in a special letter on Money).&nbsp; But here I am stressing the
    spiritual effect; what happens is that anxiety vanishes; one feel
    that as it goes out, so it comes in.&nbsp; This view is not incompatible
    with thrift and prudence, and all that lot of virtues, far from it, it
    tucks in with them quite easily.&nbsp; You must practise this; there's a
    knack in it.&nbsp; Success in this leads to a very curious result indeed;
    not only does the refusal to count (Fourpen'north or Yoga, please miss,
    and Mum says can I have a penny if I bring back the bottle!), bring
    about the needlessness of counting, but also one acquires the power
    to command!</p>

    <p>A century ago, very nearly, there lived in Bristol and &quot;Open Brother&quot;
    names Muller, who was a wizard at this; Grace before breakfast, the
    usual palaver about the Lord and His blessings and His bounty <em>et
    cetera, da capo</em>; to conclude &quot;and, Blessed Lord, we would humbly
    venture to remind Thee that this morning Thou art &pound;3 4s. 6 1/2d.
    short in the accounts; trusting that Thou wilt give this small matter
    Thine immediate attention, for Jesus' Christ's sake, Amen.&quot;&nbsp; Sure
    enough, when he came to open his post, there would be just enough,
    sometimes exactly enough, to cover that amount.</p>

    <p>This story was told me by an enemy, who thought quite seriously that
    he would go to Hell for being &quot;Open.&quot;&nbsp; (&quot;Open&quot; 
    Brethren were lax about the Lord's Supper, let people partake who were not 
    sound upon the Ramsgate Question; and other Theological Atrocities!)&nbsp; It 
    meant that the facts were so undeniable that the &quot;advertisement for Answer to
    Prayer&quot; outweighed the &quot;miracle by a heretic.&quot;</p>

    <p>I knew a poetess of great distinction who used to amuse herself by
    breaking off a conversation and saying, &quot;Give me a franc&quot; (or a shilling,
    or any small sum) and then going on with her previous remarks.&nbsp; She told
    me that of over a hundred people I was the second who had passed the coin
    to her without remark of any kind.</p>

    <p>This story&mdash;do you think?&mdash;is neither here no there.&nbsp; No, my remarks
    are rarely asyntartete.&nbsp; The Masters, at one stage or another of 
    initiation&mdash;it is forbidden to indicate the conditions&mdash;arrange for some
    test of the Aspirant's attitude in some matter, not necessarily involving cash.&nbsp; 
    If he fails, goodnight!</p>

    <p>Swords, now.&nbsp; The snags connected with this type of test are probably
    the nastiest of any.  Misunderstanding, confusion, logical error (and,
    worse, logical precision of the kind that distinguishes many lunatics),
    dispersion, indecision, failure to estimate values correctly&mdash;oh!&mdash;there 
    is no end to the list.&nbsp; So much so, indeed, that there is no
    specific critical test, it is all part of the routine, and goes on
    incessantly.</p>

    <p>Well, there is just one.&nbsp; Without warning a decision of critical
    importance has to be made by the candidate, and he is given so many
    minutes to say Yes or No.&nbsp; He gets no second chance.</p>

    <p>But I must warn you of one particular disgrace.  You know that people
    of low mentality haunt fortune-tellers of equal calibre, but with more
    low cunning.&nbsp; They do not really want to know the future, or to get
    advice; their real object is to persuade some supposed &quot;authority&quot;
    to flatter them and confirm them in their folly and stupidity.</p>

    <p>It is the same thing with a terrifying percentage of the people that
    come for &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;initiation.&quot;&nbsp; The 
    moment they learn anything they didn't know before, off they fly in a 
    temper!&nbsp; No sooner does it become apparent that the Master is <em>not</em> 
    a stupid middle-class prig and hypocrite&mdash;another edition of themselves, 
    in short&mdash;they are frightened, they are horrified, they flee away on both 
    their feet, like the man in the Bible!&nbsp; I have seen people turn fish-belly 
    pale in the face, and come near fainting outright, when it has dawned upon
    them suddenly that magick is a real thing!</p>

    <p>It's all beyond me!</p>

    <p>Cups: we are much more definite again.&nbsp; The great test is so well
    known, and accounts have already been published, that it can be here
    plainly stated.&nbsp; Early in his career, the Aspirant is exposed to the
    seductions of a Vampire, and warned in due form and due season.</p>

    <p>&quot;Sleep with A,B,C,D,E and F, my lad, and our hearty best wishes!&nbsp; But
    not with G on any account, on peril of your work!&quot;</p>

    <p>So off he goes to G, without a second's hesitation.  This test may be
    prolonged; the deadliness and subtlety of the danger has been recognized, 
    and he may have half a dozen warnings, either direct or springing
    from his relations with her.&nbsp; And the penalty is not so drastically
    final; often he gets off with a term of penal servitude.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the Aspirant who can spot at the first hint why the
    Masters think that particular woman a danger, and acts promptly and
    decisively as he should, is secretly marked down as a sword of very
    fine temper indeed!</p>

    <p>The rest of the Cup Ordeals consists for the most part of progressive
    estimations of the quality of the Postulant's devotion to the work;
    there is not, as a rule, anything particularly spectacular or dramatic
    in it.&nbsp; If you stick to your Greetings and Adorations and all such
    mnemonics, you are not likely to go very far wrong.</p>

    <p>Wands: this obviously a pure question of Will.&nbsp; You will find as
    you go on that obstacles of varying degrees of difficulty confront you;
    and the way in which you deal with them is most carefully watched.&nbsp;
    The best advice that I can give is to remember that there is little
    need of the Bull-at-a-Gate method, though that must always be ready
    in reserve; no, the best analogy is rapier-play.&nbsp; Elastic strength.&nbsp;
    Warfare shows us.</p>

    <p>That seems to cover your question more or less; but don't forget that
    it depends on yourself how much of the dramatic quality colours your
    Path.&nbsp; I suppose I have been lucky to have had the use of all the
    traditional trappings; but it is always possible to make a &quot;coat of
    many colours&quot; out of a heap of rags.&nbsp; To show you that you have 
    had Chaucer and John Bunyan&mdash;yes, and Laurence Sterne: to bring up the
    rear, James Thomson (B.V.) to say nothing of Conrad and Hardy.  Nor let me 
    forget <em>The Cream of the Jest</em> and <em>The Rivet in Grandfather's 
    Neck</em> of my friend, James Branch Cabell.</p>

    <p>So now, fair damozel, bestride thy palfrey, and away to the Mountains
    of Magick!</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Fraternally,</p>
    <p align="center">666</p>    

    <p>P.S. One danger I had purposely passed over, as it is not likely to
    come your way.  But, since others may read these letters&mdash;</p>

    <p>Some, and these the men of highest promise, often of great achievement,
    are tempted by Treason.  The acquire a &quot;Judas-complex,&quot; think how
    splendid it would be if they were to destroy the Order&mdash;or, at the
    very least, unhorse the Master.</p>

    <p>This is, of course, absurd in itself, because if they had crossed the
    Abyss, they would understand why it is impossible.&nbsp; It would be like
    &quot;destroying Electricity,&quot; or &quot;debunking&quot; the Venus of 
    Milo.&nbsp; The maximum of success possible in such an operation would be 
    to become a &quot;Black-Brother;&quot; but what happens in practice, so 
    far as my own experience goes, is complete dispersion of the mental 
    faculties amounting to suicide; I could quote no less than four cases 
    in which actual physical self-murder was the direct result.</p>
