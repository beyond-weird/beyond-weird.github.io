    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter LXXXII: Epistola Penultima: The Two Ways to Reality</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>How very sensible of you, though I admit somewhat exacting!</p>

    <p>You write&mdash;Will you tell me exactly why I should devote so much of my
    valuable time to subjects like Magick and Yoga.</p>

    <p>That is all very well.&nbsp;  But you ask me to put it in syllogistic form.&nbsp;
    I have no doubt this can be done, though the task seems somewhat complicated.&nbsp; 
    I think I will leave it to you to construct your series of syllogisms yourself from 
    the arguments of this letter.</p>

    <p>In your main question the operative word is &quot;valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, I ask, in
    my turn, should you consider your time valuable?&nbsp; It certainly is not
    valuable unless the universe has a meaning, and what is more, unless
    you know what that meaning is&mdash;at least roughly&mdash;it is millions to
    one that you will find yourself barking up the wrong tree.</p>

    <p>First of all let us consider this question of the meaning of the universe.
    It is its own evidence to design, and that design intelligent design.
    There is no question of any moral significance&mdash;&quot;one man's meat is
    another man's poison&quot; and so on.&nbsp; But there can be no possible doubt
    about the existence of some kind of intelligence, and that kind is far
    superior to anything of which we know as human.</p>

    <p>How then are we to explore, and finally to interpret this intelligence?</p>

    <p>It seems to me that there are two ways and only two.&nbsp; Imagine for a
    moment that you are an orphan in charge of a guardian, inconceivably
    learned from your point of view.&nbsp; Suppose therefore that you are puzzled
    by some problem suitable to your childish nature, your obvious and most
    simple way is to approach your guardian and ask him to enlighten you.&nbsp; It
    is clearly part of his function as guardian to do his best to help you.&nbsp;
    Very good, that is the first method, and close parallel with what we
    understand by the word Magick.&nbsp; We are bothered by some difficulty about
    one of the elements&mdash;say Fire&mdash;it is therefore natural to evoke a
    Salamander to instruct you on the difficult point.&nbsp; But you must remember
    that your Holy Guardian Angel is not only far more fully instructed than
    yourself on every point that you can conceive, but you may go so far as
    to say that it is definitely his work, or part of his work; remembering
    always that he inhabits a sphere or plane which is entirely different
    from anything of which you are normally aware.</p>

    <p>To attain to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel
    is consequently without doubt by far the simplest way by which you can
    yourself approach that higher order of being.</p>

    <p>That, then, is a clearly intelligible method of procedure.&nbsp; We call it Magick.</p>

    <p>It is of course possible to strengthen the link between him and yourself so 
    that in course of time you became capable of moving and, generally speaking, 
    operating on that plane which is his natural habitat.</p>

    <p>There is however one other way, and one only, as far as I can see, of
    reaching this state.&nbsp; It is at least theoretically possible to exalt
    the whole of your own consciousness until it becomes as free to move
    on that exalted plane as it is for him.&nbsp; You should note, by the way,
    that in this case the postulation of another being is not necessary.&nbsp;
    There is no way of refuting the solipsism if you feel like that.&nbsp;
    Personally I cannot accede to its axiom.  The evidence for an external
    universe appears to me perfectly adequate.</p>

    <p>Still there is no extra charge for thinking on those lines if you so wish.</p>

    <p>I have paid a great deal of attention in the course of my life to the
    method of exalting the human consciousness in this way; and it is
    really quite legitimate to identify my teaching with that of the Yogis.</p>

    <p>I must however point out that in the course of my instruction I have
    given continual warnings as to the dangers of this line of research.&nbsp;
    For one thing there is no means of checking your results in the ordinary 
    scientific sense.&nbsp; It is always perfectly easy to find a subjective
    explanation of any phenomenon; and when one considers that the greatest
    of all the dangers in any line of research arise from egocentric vanity,
    I do not think I have exceeded my duty in anything that I have said to
    deter students from undertaking so dangerous a course as Yoga.</p>

    <p>It is, of course, much safer if you are in a position to pursue in the
    Indian Jungles, provided that your health will stand the climate and
    also, I must say, unless you have a really sound teacher on whom you
    can safely rely.&nbsp; But then, if we once introduce a teacher, why not go
    to the Fountain-head and press towards the Knowledge and conversation
    of the Holy Guardian Angel?</p>

    <p>In any case your Indian teacher will ultimately direct you to seek
    guidance from that source, so it seems to me that you have gone to a
    great deal of extra trouble and incurred a great deal of unnecessary
    danger by not leaving yourself in the first place in the hands of the
    Holy Guardian Angel.</p>

    <p>In any case there are the two methods which stand as alternatives.&nbsp; I
    do not know of any third one which can be of any use whatever.&nbsp; 
    Logically, since you have asked me to be logical, there is certainly no
    third way; there is the external way of Magick, and the internal way
    of Yoga: there you have your alternatives, and there they cease.</p>
