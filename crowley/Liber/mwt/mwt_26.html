    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXVI: Mental Processes&mdash;Two Only are Possible</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>&quot;Occult&quot; science is the most difficult of them all.&nbsp; For one thing, 
    its subject-matter includes the whole of philosophy, from ontology and
    metaphysics down to natural history.&nbsp;  More, the most rarefied and 
    recondite of these has a direct bearing upon the conduct of life in its most
    material details, and the simplest study of such apparently earthbound
    matters as botany and mineralogy leads to the most abstruse calculations
    of the imponderables.</p>

    <p>With what weapons, then, are we to attack so formidable a fortress?</p>

    <p>The first essential is clear thinking.</p>

    <p>In a previous letter I have dealt to some extent with this subject;
    but it is so important that you must forgive me if I return to it, and
    that at length, from the outset, and in detail.</p>

    <p>Let us begin but having our own minds clear of all ambiguities, ignoring
    for the purpose of this argument all metaphysical subtleties.<a href="#ac1">*</a>&nbsp; 
    I want to confine it to the outlook of the &quot;plain man.&quot;</p>

    <p>What do we do when we &quot;think?&quot;</p>

    <p>There are two operations, and only two, possible to thought.&nbsp; However
    complex a statement may appear, it can always be reduced to a series of
    one or other of these.&nbsp; If not, it is a sham statement; nonsense 
    masquerading as sense in the cloak of verbiage and verbosity.</p>

    <p>Analysis, and Synthesis; or,</p>

    <p>Subtraction, and Addition.</p>

    <p>1. You can examine A, and find that it is composed of B and C.&nbsp; A = B + C.</p>

    <p>2. You can find out what happens to B when you add C to it.&nbsp; B + C = A.</p>

    <p>As you notice, the two are identical, after all; but the process is different.</p>

    <p>Example: Raise Copper Oxide to a very high temperature; you obtain
    metallic copper and oxygen gas.&nbsp; Heat copper in a stream of oxygen; you
    obtain copper oxide.</p>

    <p>You can complicate such experiments indefinitely, as when one analyzes
    coal-tar, or synthesizes complex products like quinine from its elements;
    but one can always describe what happens as a series of simple operations,
    either of the analytical or the synthetic type.</p>

    <p>(I wonder if you remember a delightful passage in Anatole France where
    he interprets an &quot;exalted&quot; mystical statement, first by giving the 
    words their meaning as concrete images, when he gets a magnificent hymn, like
    a passage from the <em>Rig-Veda</em>; secondly, by digging down to the original
    meaning, with an effect comical and even a little ribald.&nbsp; I fear I have
    no idea where to find it; in one of the &quot;odds and ends&quot; compilations
    most likely.&nbsp; So please, look somebody; you won't have wasted your time!)</p>

    <hr class="minor" />
    <p id="ac1"><b>*</b> I mean criticisms such as &quot;Definition is impossible;&quot;&nbsp; &quot;All 
    arguments are circular;&quot;&nbsp; &quot;All propositions are tautological.&quot;&nbsp; 
    These are true, but one is obliged to ignore them in all practical discussions.</p>
    <hr class="minor" />

    <p>This has been put in a sort of text, because the first stumbling-block
    to study is the one never has any certainty as to what the author means,
    or thinks he means, or is trying to persuade one that he means.</p>

    <p>Try something simple: &quot;The soul is part of God.&quot;&nbsp; Now then, when 
    he writes &quot;soul&quot; does he mean Atma, or Buddhi, or the Higher Manas, or
    Purusha, or Yechidah, or Neschamah, or Nepheshch, or Nous, or Psyche, or
    Phren, or Ba, or Khu, or Ka, or Animus, or Anima, or Seele, or what?</p>

    <p>As everybody, will he nill he, creates &quot;God&quot; in his own image, it is
    perfectly useless to inquire what he may happen to mean by that.</p>

    <p>But even this very plain word &quot;part.&quot;&nbsp; Does he mean to imply a 
    quantitative assertion, as when one says sixpence is part of a pound, or a factor
    indispensable, as when one says &quot;A wheel is part of a motor-car&quot;, or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    (Part actually means &quot;a share, that which is provided,&quot; according to
    Skeat; and I am closer to the place where Moses was when the candle went out than I was before!)</p>

    <p>The fact is that very few of us know what words mean; fewer still take
    the trouble to enquire.&nbsp; We calmly, we carelessly assume that our minds
    are identical with that of the writer, at least on that point; and then
    we wonder that there should be misunderstandings!</p>

    <p>The fact is (again!) that usually we don't really want to know; it is
    so very much easier to drift down the river of discourse, &quot;lazily, lazily,
    drowsily, drowsily, In the noonday sun.&quot;</p>

    <p>Why is this so satisfactory?&nbsp; Because although we may not know what a
    word means, most words have a pleasant or unpleasant connotation, each
    for himself, either because of the ideas or images thus begotten, of
    hopes or memories stirred up, or merely for the sound of the word itself.&nbsp;
    (I have gone a month's journey out of my way to visit a town, just because
    I liked the sound of the name!)</p>

    <p>Then there are devices: style&mdash;rhythm, cadence, rime, ornamentation
    of a thousand kinds.&nbsp; I think one may take it that the good writer makes
    use of such artifice to make his meaning clear; the bad writer to obscure
    it, or to conceal the fact that he has none.</p>

    <p>One of the best items of the education system at the Abbey in Cefal was
    the weekly Essay.&nbsp; Everyone, including children of five or six, had to
    write on &quot;The Housing Problem,&quot; &quot;Why Athens Decayed,&quot; 
    &quot;The Marriage System,&quot; &quot;Buddhist Ethics&quot; and the like; 
    the subject didn't matter much; the point was that one had to discover, 
    arrange and condense one's ideas about it, so as to present it in a given 
    number of words, 93 or 156, or 418 as like as not, that number, neither more 
    nor less.&nbsp; A superb discipline for any writer.</p>

    <p>I had a marvellous lesson myself some years earlier.&nbsp; I had cut down a
    certain ritual of initiation to what I thought were the very barest bones,
    chiefly to make it easy to commit to memory.<a href="#1">1</a>&nbsp; Then came a 
    candidate who was deaf&mdash;not merely &quot;a little hard of hearing;&quot; his 
    tympana were ruptured&mdash;and the question was How?</p>

    <p>All right for most of it; one could show him the words typed on slips.&nbsp;
    But during part of the ceremony he was hoodwinked; one was reduced to
    the deaf-and-dumb alphabet devised for such occasions.&nbsp; I am as clumsy
    and stupid at that as I am at most things, and lazy, infernally lazy, on
    top of that.&nbsp; Well, when it came to the point, the communication of the
    words became abominably, intolerably tedious.&nbsp; And then!&nbsp; Then I found
    that about two-thirds of my "absolutely essential" ritual was not necesasary 
    at all!</p>
