    <h3>Chapter XL: Coincidence</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>When I was writing <a href="mwt_39.html">that letter about prophecy</a>, I was hot and bothered
    all the time by my faithful sentinel, the well-greaved Hoplite that
    stands at the postern of my consciousness, ready to challenge every
    thought&mdash;and woe to the intruder who cannot give the countersign!&nbsp;
    This time the dear old ruffian thought the matter serious enough to
    report Higher Up.&nbsp; &quot;It is put plainly enough, emphatically enough,
    incontrovertibly enough&quot; was the gist of his communication &quot;that the
    first and most irretrievable trick of the enemy is to dupe you into
    passing Captain Coincidence as 'Friend,' whereas he is naturally the
    most formidable of all your foes when it comes to a question of proof.&quot;</p>

    <p>Quite right, Sergeant-Major!&nbsp; But it is not only about prophecy, but
    about all sorts of things, in particular, of course, the identification
    of angels and similar problems.</p>

    <p>Well, we have captured quite a few lads of the company of Captain
    Coincidence; let us have them up for examination and learn what we
    can about their weapons and other warlike matters!</p>

    <p>I take our first prisoner from <em>Magick</em>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      The most famous novel of Fielding is called <em>Tom Jones</em>.&nbsp; It
      happened that FRATER PERDURABO was staying in a hotel in London.&nbsp; He
      telephoned a friend named Fielding at the latter's house, and was
      answered by Mr. Fielding's secretary, who said that his employer had
      left the house a few minutes previously, and could only be reached by
      telephoning a certain office in the City at between 11 o'clock and a
      quarter past.&nbsp; FRATER PERDURABO had an appointment at 11 o'clock with
      a music-hall star, the place being the entrance to a theatre.&nbsp; In order
      to remind himself, he made a mental note that, as soon as he saw the
      lady, he would raise his hand and say, before greeting her: 'Remind me
      that I must telephone at once to Fielding,'&nbsp; when he met her.&nbsp; He 
      did this, and she advance toward Him with the same gesture, and said in
      the same breath, 'Remind me that I have to telephone to Tom Jones'&mdash;
      the name of a music-hall agent employed by her.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here comes another, this time completely crazy!&nbsp; Nothing &quot;Literary&quot;
    about it; no sense anywhere; a pure freak.</p>

    A friend of mine, A, rang up a friend of hers, B, at her flat in Holland
    Park, some 3 or 4 miles west, and a p'int to the Nor'rard, of Piccadilly
    Circus.&nbsp; After the usual series of &quot;they don't answer&quot;, 
    &quot;line's engaged&quot;, &quot;unobtainable&quot;, &quot;line's out of 
    order&quot;, &quot;line's temporarily disconnected at the subscriber's 
    request&quot;, an appeal to &quot;Supervisor&quot; got her connected 
    instantly.&nbsp; Yet another girl friend, C, appears in, and vanishes from,
    the story; she said &quot;Oh, what a pity, you've just missed her; she went
    out five minutes ago.&nbsp; I think she'll be back in an hour's time, try
    then.&quot;

    <p>A waited impatiently, and rang up once more.&nbsp; Again the series of
    nonsense-difficulties about getting the connection.&nbsp; At last the answer
    came.&nbsp; This time yet one more girl friend D.&nbsp; &quot;Oh, what a pity!&nbsp; 
    You've just missed her; she left the box not five minutes ago.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Box,&quot;
    screamed A, &quot;what box?&nbsp; Have I got mixed up in a Trunk Murder?&quot; &quot;Why,
    <em>this</em> box,&quot; replied D, calmly.&nbsp; &quot;What &mdash; &mdash; box?&quot; 
    shouted A.&nbsp; &quot;Isn't that her flat?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Her flat! are you crazy?&nbsp; 
    This is a call-box in Shaftesbury Avenue.&quot;&nbsp; Collapse of A's confidence in the sanity 
    of Nature.</p>

    <p>One may note that there was no similarity in the names of the exchanges,
    or in the numbers.</p>

    <p>It is the most grotesquely impossible case of &quot;wrong number&quot; that ever
    came my way.</p>

    <p>Now for one or two oddities.&nbsp; Recently, needing to relax, I borrowed
    three &quot;thrillers&quot; from different sources.&nbsp; In every case, the plot 
    turned on two men being so alike that no one could tell them apart.&nbsp; (<em>Rupert 
    of Hentzau</em>, <em>John Chilcote, M.P.</em>, <em>Melander's Millions</em>.)</p>

    <p>I traveled from Louisville to Detroit by a railroad whose nickname was
    the &quot;Big Four&quot;, my object being some business connected with my 
    <em>Book 4</em>.&nbsp; The name of my express was the &quot;Big Four&quot;&mdash;it 
    left from No. 4 platform at 4 p.m.&nbsp; My sleeping berth was No. 4 in Car No. 4; 
    and my ticket was No. 44,444.  I ought to have been April 4, I suppose; but it 
    wasn't.</p>

    <p>Last week a letter from me appeared in the Sunday Dispatch with regard
    to the Everest Mystery of 1921.&nbsp; I expressed my view that the two lost
    climbers, last seen on an easy snow-slope near the summit, had simply
    been blown into the air by one of the sudden gusts of incredible fierce
    winds which are common at those heights, and dashed to earth perhaps a
    mile away.</p>

    <p>After reading this, I went to a friend's room to borrow a book, picked
    up her Shakespeare's <em>Histories</em>, and, opening it at random, came upon:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,<br>
      And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</p>
      <em>Richard III</em>, Act I, Sc. 3.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Now here's a story that's too good to lose; not the mistiest phantasm
    of an ideogram how to class it; for one thing, it's chock-a-block with
    moral lessons and economic theories and political summats; but there's
    coincidence in it somewhere, and under coincidence down it shall go.
    Even if only by coincidence.</p>

    <p>From 1895 e.v. onwards I dealt with Colin Lunn.</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;Of all the tobacconists under the sun,<br>
      There is none, there is none, like the great Colin Lunn&mdash;&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>of Sidney Street, Cambridge.&nbsp; When I started round the world, alas for
    fidelity!&nbsp; I began to forget him.&nbsp; By 1906 e.v. the operation was 
    practically complete.</p>

    <p>In '42 e.v. I spent a few days with friends in Cambridge.&nbsp; Sauntering
    along K.P. (King's Parade to you, madam!) on my way back to the station
    with half an hour or so to kill, I thought I would pop in to Lunn's new
    shop there, and pass the time of day.&nbsp; He might have something to take
    my fancy.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; Needless to say, I didn't know the shopman 
    from Adam, as he did not offer me a view of his identification mark.&nbsp; I 
    asked after old friends; we gossiped of old times and new; presently he
    observed, putting a hand under the counter: &quot;I think this is yours sir.&quot;
    &quot;How do you know who I am?&nbsp; I've never seen you before.&quot;&nbsp; 
    &quot;Oh, yes sir, I was the odd-job boy at the old Sidney Street shop; I remember 
    you quite well.&quot;&nbsp; By this time there lay on the counter a strange 
    familiar-unfamiliar object&mdash;a pipe that I had left for some minor repair before
    hurrying off to the East 37 years before!&nbsp; I am smoking it now.</p>

    <p>And you can draw your own beastly conclusion!</p>

    <p>Here is a last, a passing strange account of a coincidence&mdash;or should
    it come under &quot;Answers to Prayer.&quot;</p>

    <p>A young enthusiastic &quot;Heaven Born&quot; (=I.C.S.)<a href="#ac1">*</a> parlous 
    pious, was engaged to an exquisite chaste damosel in Lutterworth.&nbsp; Praised and 
    promoted by his appreciative chiefs in Bombay, he felt his future sure enough to go
    home on leave, marry her, and bring her out to India.&nbsp; At their parting,
    she had given him a ring; naturally, he set great store by it.&quot; But the
    climate had thinned him; it was loose; playing with it as he talked
    with a friend on the ship, it slipped from his finger, and fell into the
    harbour.&quot; He suppressed an expression of annoyance.&nbsp; &quot;Well that's past
    praying for,&quot; laughed the friend&mdash;unhappily an infidel, not a <em>true</em>
    friend at all.&nbsp; The young man stiffened.&nbsp; &quot;It is?&quot; he answered 
    solemnly and emphatically; &quot;We shall see.&quot;&nbsp; And he retired to his cabin 
    to lay his grief before the Lord.</p>

    <p>The ship arrived at Aden without incident.&nbsp; While she was coaling, it
    was the idle habit of some sailors to bait a hook with a large piece of
    pork, and fish for sharks.  An hour later they caught a fine specimen,
    and hauled it aboard.&nbsp; They cut it open.&nbsp; No ring.</p>

    <p>I hope you don't think I'm letting my pen run away with me:</p>

    <blockquote>
      &quot;Pens!&nbsp; Good Lord,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows if you drive them or they drive you?&quot;
    </blockquote>

    <p>No, I have not forgotten that I am here to instruct as well as to amuse:
    also, to make certain observations which will, I flatter myself, be rather new to you.</p>

    <p>I plunge headlong.</p>

    <p>Everything that happens, no matter what, is an inconceivably improbable
    coincidence.&nbsp; You remember how you had to begin when you first came to
    me for help.&nbsp; I said to you, &quot;Here are you, and no other person, come to
    see me, and no other person, in this room, and no other room, at this
    time, and not other time.&nbsp; Hod did that come about?&quot;&nbsp; The answer to 
    that question is the first entry in your Magical Diary: and, with a slightly
    different object in view, the first step in the practice of Liber 
    Thisharb</a> and the acquisition of Magical Memory.</p>

    <p>Why, hang it all; the events of the last hour, even, might have gone
    just an infinitesimally little bit different, and the interview would
    not have taken place as it did.  Consider then, that factors stretching
    back into Eternity&mdash;all the factors there are!&mdash;have each one 
    contributed in its degree to bringing this interview about.&nbsp; What a 
    fantastic improbability!&nbsp; Yet here we are.</p>

    <p>Chance blindly rules the Universe.&nbsp; But what is Chance?&nbsp; And where does
    purpose intervene?&nbsp; To what extent?</p>

    <p>I shall now conduct you, no less firmly than Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim,
    to Monte Carlo.</p>

    <p>(Excuse me!&nbsp; I was just called to the telephone.&nbsp; Somebody of whose
    existence I was not aware has fallen ill in Ireland&mdash;and bang went my
    plans for tomorrow.)</p>

    <p>You walk quietly into the Casino; it seems to you that the excitement
    is even more noticeable than usual.&nbsp; You see a friend at the table
    &quot;Here in the nick of time!&quot; he gasps.&nbsp; &quot;Black has just 
    turned up for the 24th time running.&quot;&nbsp; You press forward to plank 
    the maximum on Red.&nbsp; The wheel spins; Black again!  &quot;Forty thousand 
    she-devils in the belfry of St. Nicholas Rocambole-de-Ronchonot!&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;But --- but&quot; (you stammer when spirits of hartshorn have revived you)&nbsp; 
    &quot;in the whole history of the tables a colour has <em>never</em> turned up more than
    24 times running!&quot;</p>

    <p>My poor friend, what has that got to do with it?&nbsp; True, <em>from the start</em>
    it is countless millions to 1 that there will not be a run of 24 on the
    red or the black; but the probability on any single spin (ignoring zero)
    is always one to one.&nbsp; The black compartments do not contract because the
    ball has fallen into any one of them.</p>

    <p>Anyone who gambles at all is either a dilettante, a crook, or a B.F.&nbsp; If
    you could get the B.F.'s to understand the very elementary mathematics
    set forth above, good-night to gambling!&nbsp; And a good riddance, at that!&nbsp;
    Well, there is one advantage in the system; it does help the intelligent
    man to steal a march on his neighbours!</p>

    <p>In all this the important point for my present purpose is to show you
    how entirely this question of probability and coincidence is dependent
    on <em>your attention</em>.</p>

    <p>The sequence B B B B B B B at roulette is most unlikely to occur; but so, in
    exactly the same degree, is the sequence B R B R R B R or any other
    sequence.&nbsp; The one passes unnoticed, the other causes surprise, only
    because you have in your mind the idea of &quot;a run on black.&quot;</p>

    <p>Extend this line of thought a little, and link it up with what I was
    saying about the Magical Diary; you realize that every phenomenon
    soever is equally improbably, and &quot;infinitely&quot; so.&nbsp; The Universe 
    is therefore <em>nothing but</em> Coincidence!</p>

    <p>How then can any event be more improbable than any other?&nbsp; Why, very
    simply.&nbsp; Go back to Monte; proclaim that at Table No. 3 Black will
    turn up 7 times running, after this next spin.&nbsp; (Or, of course, any
    other series of 7.)&nbsp; <em>Now</em> you see how Coincidence links up with 
    Prophecy!</p>

    <p><em>A fortiori</em>, Coincidence is destroyed by Purpose, if, wishing to enlighten
    you on the subject, I write this letter and post it to your address, your
    receipt of it is no longer Coincidence.&nbsp; So then coincidence must be
    entirely both unforeseen and unintentional; in other words, absolutely
    senseless.&nbsp; But we have just proved that the Universe is nothing <em>but</em>
    Coincidence; it therefore is senseless.</p>

    <p>So, having established the asymptote of our hyperbolic hyperbola, and
    shewn it to be asynartete, why should we not acquiesce, and say olive oil?</p>

    <p align="center"><em>Love is the law, love under will.</em></p>
    <p align="center">Yours fraternally,</p>
