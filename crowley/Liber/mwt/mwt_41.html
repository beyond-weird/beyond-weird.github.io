    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XLI: &quot;Are we Reincarnations of the Ancient Egyptians?&quot;</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>That accursed conscience of mine has been pricking me ever since I dashed
    off that rather curt and off-hand letter card in answer to yours of the
    18th.&nbsp; I had intended as a matter of fact to let you have the present
    coruscation as soon as I could get my secretary in the offing, but I
    thought I would snap your head off in the strength of your question as
    salutary chastisement.</p>

    <p>I do wish you would understand that all these speculations are not only
    idle and senseless because you cannot possibly verify their accuracy,
    but a deadly &nbsp; You ask if we, meaning, I suppose, the English,
    are now reincarnating the Egyptians.  When I was a boy it was the Romans,
    while the French undertook the same thankless office for the Greeks.&nbsp; I
    say &quot;deadly poison;&quot; because when you analyse you see at once that this
    is a device for flattering yourself.&nbsp; You have a great reverence for the
    people who produced Luxor and the Pyramids; and it makes you feel nice
    and comfortable inside if you think that you were running around in those
    days as Rameses II or a high priest in Thebes or something equally
    congenial.</p>

    <p>You may say that I am myself the chief of sinners in this respect because
    of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, but this was not my doing.&nbsp; It was imposed upon me
    by The Book of the Law</a>, and I do not feel particularly 
    flattered or comforted by this identification.&nbsp; The only interest to me is the 
    remarkable manner in which this is interwoven with the existence of the &quot;Cairo
    working.&quot;</p>

    <p>Your second and third questions are still worse.&nbsp; I should be ashamed of
    myself if I were to do so much as to refer to them.</p>

    <p>That must serve for that.&nbsp; But your fourth question I did answer after
    a fashion.&nbsp; It has however struck me that I might have given you a more
    detailed instruction with advantage.</p>

    <p>When I was up the Mindoun Chong in Burma, I started an investigation of
    my dreams; and the only way to catch them was to write down as much as
    I could remember on waking, instantly.&nbsp; The result of doing this is
    rather surprising.&nbsp; To begin with, I discovered, especially as the
    practice progressed, that I was having many more dreams than I had
    previously supposed.&nbsp; This might have come about in either of two ways.</p>

    <p>(1)  The practice might have actually increased my tendency to dream,
    and (2) the habit of observation may have brought dreams to the surface
    which would otherwise have gone unremarked.&nbsp; In either case the figures
    were quite definite.</p>

    <p>I found almost at once, that is to say after about a month, that practically 
    every dream that I could remember, could be quite clearly ascribed
    to one of two causes: (a) the events of the previous day or days, or
    the subjects which had interested and excited me during that period, and
    (b) the physical conditions of the moment.&nbsp; For instance, a good deal 
    of the time of the experiment I was sleeping in what might have been
    euphemistically called a houseboat.&nbsp; It was liable to leak; and on such
    occasions as I woke to find water trickling down my nose, I found that
    the dream from which I had wakened was an adventure of some sort in
    connection with water.&nbsp; (It is quite notorious, I believe, that many
    asthmatic subjects are pestered by dreams of having been guillotined
    in a previous incarnation.&nbsp; Alan Bennett, I may mention, was one such.)</p>

    <p>As the practice proceeds, you should find not only that your dreams
    increase in number per night, but also became very much fuller, clearer
    and more coherent.&nbsp; I assume that the reason is that the fact of your
    paying attention to them brings them to the surface.</p>

    <p>I am not quite sure whether this is a complete and adequate answer to
    your question 4, &quot;How can I best bring my sleeping memory into my 
    waking hours?&quot;</p>

    <p>I have studied, and my secretary has studied, and we can make no head or
    tail of your remark about brain exercises with sketch.</p>

    <p>Well, I must hope for the best, and leave you with my blessing.</p>
