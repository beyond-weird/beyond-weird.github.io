    <h2 class="title">MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS<br>
    By Aleister Crowley</h2>
    <h3>Chapter XXXIV: The Tao (1)</h3>

    <p>Cara Soror,</p>
    <p align="center"><em>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</em></p>

    <p>This is the hardest question you have yet put to me: to explain the
    Tao.&nbsp; The only proper answer would be Silence, trusting to the slow
    dispersion and absorption of the disturbance created by your asking
    it.&nbsp; In that sentence there lies, really, the whole explanation; but
    I see well enough that it won't do for you.&nbsp; You are not yet old or
    wise enough to understand that the only way to clear muddy water is
    to leave it alone.&nbsp; Still, you doubtless expect me to tell you just
    how that comes to pass; I will not disappoint you.&nbsp; First of all,
    what is the Tao?&nbsp; No proposed equivalent in any other language comes
    within a billion light-years of giving even an approximation.&nbsp; For one
    thing, it is itself a paradox; for another, it has several meanings
    which are apparently quite distinct.&nbsp; For instance, one sinologist
    calls it &quot;Reason&quot;; another, &quot;The Way&quot;; another 
    &quot;Tat&quot; or &quot;Shiva.&quot;&nbsp; These are all true in one sense 
    or another.&nbsp; My own &quot;White Hope&quot; (see <em>The Book of Thoth</em>) 
    is to identify it with the Qabalistic Zero.&nbsp; This last attribution is 
    useful, as I will show presently, for hard practical reasons; it is an 
    assumption which indicates the method of the Old Wise One who approaches the 
    Tao.</p>

    <p>As you know, the supreme classic of this subject, is the <em>Tao Teh King</em>;
    and I must suppose that you have read this in at least one of the several
    translations, else I should have to start by pushing my own version at
    you.&nbsp; (This has been ready for a quarter of a century, and I seem to be
    unable to get it printed!)&nbsp; None of these published translations, learned
    and admirable though they may be as such, can be of use except to familiarize 
    you with the terminology; for not one of these scholars has the most nebulous 
    idea of that Laotze was talking about.&nbsp; I can hardly hope to emphasize 
    sternly enough how deep and wide is the &quot;Great Gulf fixed&quot; between 
    the initiate and the profane, when questions of this kind are on the Magic 
    Carpet.&nbsp; Suppose you were transported (on that Carpet!) to a planet 
    where the highest means of reproduction was germination; try to make the 
    denizens understand Catullus, Shelley, Rossetti, or Emily Bronte&euml;!&nbsp; 
    It is, honestly, quite as bad as that.&nbsp; How can anyone grasp the idea 
    of perfect and absolute negation being at the same time the sole motive force 
    of all that exits?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Tao hath no will to work;<br>
      But by its influence even<br>
      The Moon and Sun rejoice to run<br>
      Among the starry Seven.&quot;</p>

      <p><em>King Kang</em> K<em>hang</em>.<a href="#1">1</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Book of the Law</a> states the doctrine of Tao very succinctly:
    &quot;...thou hast no right but to do thy will.&nbsp; Do that, and no other shall say nay.&nbsp; 
    For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.&quot;
    (AL I, 42-44)</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Thus also the Sage, seeking not any goal, attaineth all things; he
    does not interfere in the affairs of his body, and so that body acteth
    without friction.&nbsp; It is because he meddleth not with his personal aims
    that these come to pass with simplicity.&quot;&nbsp; <em>Tao Teh </em>K<em>ing</em>, 
    VII, 2.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The ideal analogy seems to be that of a planet in its orbit.&nbsp; It has
    its &quot;true motion;&quot; it meets the minimum of friction from circumambient
    space.&nbsp; When it suffers the attraction of another body, it sways slightly
    to make the proper adjustment without effort or argument; it can, consequently, 
    continue indefinitely in its orbit.</p>

    <p>This is roughly the plan of the Taoist in his attitude to life.  Having
    ascertained the Path which satisfies the equations of his Nature (as we
    say, &quot;found his True Will&quot;) he continues &quot;without lust of 
    result,&quot; acting only when it happens to be necessary to adjust himself 
    to any external stress that affects him, and so proceeds happily</p>

    <blockquote>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;thinking of a way<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed oneself on batter,<br>
       And so go on from day to day<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a little fatter."
    </blockquote>
    <p>&mdash;assuming that his &quot;True Will&quot; is of that variety.&nbsp; Basil King 
    Lamus asserts this in <em>The Diary of A Drug Fiend</em> when he says: &quot;If I were a
    dog, I should bark; if I were an owl, I should hoot.&quot;&nbsp; It is rather
    like the pattern in the game of dominoes; you put the card that matches.&nbsp;
    No other consideration comes into it at all.</p>

    <p>It is the extreme simplicity of this idea which baffles people's minds,
    and the universal quality of impatience which makes everybody fidget,
    and so injure the delicacy of the &quot;fine adjustment&quot; which is the essence
    of the work.</p>

    <p>When I used to climb rocks, I never jumped, I never grabbed, I never
    made a sudden or a violent movement; therefore, with thin smooth arms
    like a young girl's, and legs, tough enough it is true but always slow
    and steady, I used to find myself at the top of pitches that had beaten
    all the gymnasts.</p>

    <p>In every sport worth the name one may observe similar facts.&nbsp; Consider
    the delicacy required for big breaks at billiards; the problem is always
    to secure favourable readjustment with a minimum of disturbance.&nbsp; Of
    course, there are positions which demand drastic treatment; but that
    is the best evidence that the balls have got into the worst possible
    mess from your point of view.&nbsp; But it was an exquisitely delicate &quot;safety
    shot&quot; that got them like that.&nbsp; True, there are games in which brute
    force is the way to victory; but such games never make progress in themselves.&nbsp;
    The &quot;tug-of-war&quot; or &quot;tossing the caber&quot; are exactly as they were
    fifty&mdash;or five hundred&mdash;years ago.&nbsp; Contrast the advance in 
    &quot;positional&quot; chess!</p>

    <p>Oh yes, this is all old stuff!&nbsp; Of course it is; but it remains a useful 
    sort of basis for meditation when you are seeking to understand one aspect of the Way of he Tao.</p>

    <p>Anyhow (you protest) this is getting away from the question as to what
    Tao actually <em>is</em>.&nbsp; Good; but I want you to abstain from trying to 
    make an intellectual image of it, still less to visualize it.&nbsp; I tried at
    one time to do something of the sort with the <em>Fourth Dimension</em>:<a href="#2">2</a>
    Hinton gives a practice involving complex patterns of cubes; and I was never able 
    to make anything of it.</p>

    <p>As I said above, it is a matter of Neschamah; but what follows may help you.</p>

    <p>Why is the Tao translated &quot;Reason&quot;?&nbsp; Because by &quot;Reason&quot; is 
    here meant the structure of the mind itself; a Buddhist who had succeeded with
    Mahasatipat<em>th</em>ana might call it the Consciousnesss of the Tendency to
    Perceive the Sensation of Anything.&nbsp; For in the last resort, and through
    the pursuit of one line of analysis, this structure is all that we can
    call our consciousness.&nbsp; Everything of which we can in any way be aware
    may be interpreted as being some function of this structure.</p>

    <p>Note!&nbsp; <em>Function</em>.&nbsp; For now we see why Tao may also be translated &quot;The
    Way&quot;; for it is the <em>motion</em> of the structure that we observe.&nbsp; There is
    no Being apart from Going.</p>

    <p>You are familiar with the Four Powers of the Sphinx, attributed by the
    Adepts of old time to their Four Elements.&nbsp; Air is to Know, Scire; 
    Fire is to Will, Velle; Water is to Dare, Audere; and Earth is to Keep
    Silence, Tacere.&nbsp; But now that a fifth Element, spirit, is generally
    recognized in the Qabalah, I have deemed it proper to add a Fifth Power
    corresponding: to Go, Ire.&nbsp; (<em>Book of Thoth</em>, p. 275)<a href="#3">3</a></p>

    <p>Then, as Spirit is the Origin, the Essence, and the Sum of the other four, 
    so is to Go in relation to those powers.&nbsp; And to Go is the very
    meaning of the name God, as elsewhere shewn in these letters; hence
    the Egyptian Gods were signalized as such by their bearing the Ankh,
    which is a Sandal-strap, and in its form the Crux Ansata, the Rosy
    Cross, the means whereby we demonstrate the Godhead of our Nature.&nbsp; See
    then how sweetly each idea slides into the next!&nbsp; How <em>right</em> this is,
    that the Quintessence should be dynamic and not static!&nbsp; For if there
    were some form of Being separate from Going, it would necessarily be
    subject to decay; and, in any case, a thing impossible to apprehend,
    since apprehension is itself an Act, not an idea immobile which would
    be bound to change in the very moment of grasping it.</p>

    <p>As I have tried to shew in another letter, the &quot;Point-Event&quot; (or 
    whatever it is) of which we are <em>aware</em> is a change, or, less inaccurately,
    the memory of one; the things that change remain relentlessly unknown.</p>

    <p>It does seem to me, young woman, that you ought to go over these ideas
    again and again, familiarizing yourself intimately with this process of
    passing from one to another, so intimately that it becomes automatic
    and spontaneous for you to run round the circle in perfectly frictionless 
    ease; for otherwise your mind will be for ever pestering you all your life, 
    and even your conscience reproaching you; they will say &quot;But you have 
    never got a definite answer to any single one of your original questions.&quot;&nbsp; 
    We are all&mdash;most of us, anyhow&mdash;born with this hankering after the definite; 
    it is our weakness that yearns for repose.&nbsp; We do not see that this is death; if 
    any of these answers could be cut off short and neatly trimmed with paper frills like 
    a ham, it would no longer be even an approximation to truth.</p>

    <p>I am quite sure that this is the Doctrine of the Tao, and of opinion
    that no other body of teaching puts forward its thought more clearly or
    more simply.</p>
