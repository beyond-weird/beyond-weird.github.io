    <p>Lying sick in the Hotel Iturbide, I was attended by an American doctor named Parsons,
    which whom I stuck up a warm friendship. He was certainly a &quot;live wire&quot;. The
    faculty had just devised as new source of income by inventing appendicitis. Parsons heard
    of this and wired to the States for a partner who could perform the operation. He then
    proceeded to advise immediate operation every time one of his many wealthy patients had a
    stomach-ache. At a thousand Mexican dollars a time, it did not take many months to pile up
    a fortune.</p>
    <p>The English colony in Mexico City was disliked and despised. The consul was habitually
    constipated and the vice-consul habitually drunk. It is a curious fact that all over the
    world these qualities never vary. A wide field is open the philosophical speculation.</p>
    <p>I came to frequent the American colony and club. I remember being introduced to a new
    but already popular and respected member, &quot;Meet Mr. Tewkesbury,&quot; and, a loud
    whisper, &quot;<em>Thorne</em>, you know, who got away from Chi with a quarter of a
    million plunks.&quot; At this club I met some really charming ranchers, who invited me to
    stay with them and convalesce. Their place was near Guanajato, a great centre for silver
    mines. Guanajato possessed an unique curiosity: some eccentric millionaire had built a
    theatre, sparing no expense to make it the most gorgeous building of its kind in the
    world. The stalls, for instance, were upholstered in real velvet, embroidered with real
    gold thread. For some reason, I think because the President had declined to open it, the
    owner felt himself insulted and kept it shut up. It was never opened at all except as a
    show place for visitors like myself, and finally was somehow burnt to the ground.</p>
    <p>Mexico City was full of American professional gamblers and confidence men. I saw a good
    deal of two of these; a lank grey Yankee named McKee and his genial jackal Wilson, or some
    such name. After a few days' acquaintance Wilson approached me with the following
    proposal. It appeared that the manager of a mine near St. Luis Potosi had stolen a
    quantity of gold dust. He had got scared and dared not bolt. Wilson thought that if we
    offered him a thousand dollars, each putting up half, he would be willing to hand over the
    compromising sacks, value five thousand or so. Not for nothing had I read the works of
    &quot;Pitcher of The Pink 'Un&quot;, and other authorities on the gentle art of parting a
    fool and his money. I joyfully accepted Wilson's proposal. &quot;Bring your five hundred
    right along,&quot; I said, &quot;and I'll go and put</p>
    <p>{208}</p>
    <p>the job through. I know you're too busy to leave the city.&quot; He agreed and returned
    an hour later, not with the cash, but with his partner. They apologized profusely for
    mistaking me for a mug. &quot;Look here,&quot; said McKee, &quot;the innocence of your
    face is a fortune. I know a rich man here who is crazy on gambling. You shall rook him at
    Brazilian poker. (In this game one backs one's hand as in ordinary poker, but the hands
    are of two cards with the option of taking a third, as in baccarat.) We'll signal you what
    he holds. With your face, he'll never get wise to the stunt.&quot;</p>
    <p>The psychology of these people really interested me. They had no experience of the kind
    of man who knows all the tricks but refuses to cheat. Their world was composed entirely of
    sharps and flats. It is the typical American conception; the use of knowledge is to get
    ahead of the other fellow, and the question of fairness depends on the chance of
    detection. We see this even in amateur sport. The one idea is to win. Knowledge for its
    own sake, pleasure for its own sake, seem to the American mere frivolity, &quot;Life is
    real, life is earnest.&quot; One of themselves told me recently that the American ideal is
    attainment, while that of Europe is enjoyment. There is much truth in this, and the reason
    is that in Europe we have already attained everything, and discovered that nothing is
    worth while. Unless we live in the present, we do not live at all.</p>
    <p>Mexico was foul of gambling houses and I used to play a great deal. The chief game was
    Monte, in which the dealer exposes two cards; the punter can back which he pleases; bets
    being placed, the dealer skins the pack, and the first card with duplicates one of the two
    exposed cards wins for it. The bank's percentage is that if the first card skinned decides
    (is &quot;in the door&quot;, as they say), it only pays three quarters of the stake.</p>
    <p>The son of one of the prominent members of the old Golden Dawn went to the bad and
    became a professional crook. Him I once frequented to study the psychology of hawk and
    pigeon.</p>
    <p>First let me insist that the nave is always a fool. Prosperity is a function of
    biological success and (facts being facts) the habit of lying begets credulity. My friend
    never profited except now and then for a few lucky weeks, though he scooped in that time
    enough to keep a man with a grain of good sense for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>The confidence trick is protean, but in all its forms the essence is to get the victim
    off his guard. Observe how this fact confirms by general theory that surrender of the will
    to the guidance of the emotions is destructive of judgment. The first act in every trick
    is what is called the &quot;come on&quot; or the &quot;build up&quot;. Its crudest form is
    providing to a stranger that you trust him by asking him to go away for five minutes with
    your watch and money. From this has been developed an amazing structure of subtle
    strategy. The shrewest bankers have been looted for tens of thousands. The general plan</p>
    <p>{209}</p>
    <p>is to bring about, in an apparently natural way, a series of incidents in which the
    chief of the confederates shows to advantage. His victim is induced to admire his keen
    sense of humour, his generosity, fairness, integrity, and so on in various emergencies.
    When the swindler fees sure that his victim trusts him implicitly, he proceeds to the next
    act. A scheme is suggested by which they shall both make a fortune, and in one of a
    million ways a situation is brought about in which it is hard for the victim to avoid
    putting up his cash. He could hardly show suspicion, even if he felt it, without giving
    outrageous offence for which he could produce no excuse. His common decency is concerned
    and at the same time a strong appeal made to his interests. He produces the goods --- and
    hears no more of the matter.</p>
    <p>I could give the details of half a hundred schemes of this sort. Their ingenuity
    extorts my intellectual admiration, and yet there is always a fundamental flaw that, in
    the hands of such men, a million melts more quickly than a thousand would with anyone
    else. In every swell bar and hotel one can see plenty such --- all well dressed and well
    groomed, laughing and joking, and throwing their money about, and all the time ninety per
    cent feel a sinking in the pit of the stomach as the thought hammers persistently at the
    back of their brains, &quot;How shall I pay my bill?&quot; at the best; and, overshadowing
    lesser worries, &quot;What about when my luck turns?&quot; &quot;When will my own
    confidence in the imbecility of my fellow men be enlightened by their robbing me of the
    stake I risked, my liberty?&quot;</p>
    <p>A delicious ride by electric tram from the city beings one to Tacubaya, a luxurious
    pleasure resort with a big casino. The play is at long tables stacked with thousands of
    silver dollars. One night I noticed the electric chandelier beginning to swing. Crashing
    sounds came from without. Suddenly the lights went out! It was an earthquake. Attendants
    rushed in with lighted candles. It could hardy have been dark for two minutes; the room
    was almost empty and most of the cash had vanished.</p>
    <p>I had been playing a modified martingale with happier results than my stupidity
    deserved. But, one night, luck ran against me and my stake had increased to the limit
    allowed by the house. There was a slight delay --- I think someone had called for a fresh
    pack of cards --- I found myself walking nervously up and down. Somewhat as had happened
    in the chess congress at Berlin, I had a vision of myself from somewhere outside.
    &quot;Look at that young fool,&quot; I seemed to be saying; &quot;that stake he has there
    is about a month's income.&quot; The cards were dealt. I had won, but &quot;in the
    door&quot;, so that I only got seventy-five per cent. I picked up my winnings, walked out
    and have never gambled again; except once at Monte Carlo for the fun of the thing, some
    years later. I made it a rule to take five pounds to the casino and quit, when it was
    gone, for the day. As luck would have it, on the fourth day I kept on winning. I had an
    appointment for lunch. Remembering this, I</p>
    <p>{210}</p>
    <p>suddenly awoke to the fact that I had won over three hundred an fifty pounds. That was
    good enough for me. After lunch I packed up and escaped to Nice, with a vow never again to
    set foot in the principality.</p>
    <p>All this time I had not forgotten my project of climbing the mountains of Mexico.
    Somehow, my Indian girl knew that I was keen on them; and one day she called me up to the
    roof of the house and pointed out two snowcapped peaks. As I have already said, my
    judgment of heights and distances was surprisingly accurate. Mexico being about seven
    thousand feet above the sea, I judged these peaks to be from eleven to twelve thousand,
    and their distance from the city some eight to ten miles. I proposed to myself to stroll
    out and climb them one day. &quot;From theirsummits,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;I may
    be able to see the big mountains eighty miles away.&quot; The scheme miscarried. I was
    looking at the big mountains themselves! I had made no allowance for the clearness of the
    air. People whose experience is confined to Europe have no means of judging correctly. As
    I found later, the Himalayas are to Mexican peaks as these are to the Alps. In north India
    one sees a mountain apparently within a day's march, yet four days later that mountain
    will hardly have changed its apparent size and distance.</p>
    <p>I do not know why I made no attempts on the peaks. Perhaps it was from an obscure
    feeling of comradeship. I preferred to wait till Eckenstein joined me, which he was to do
    towards the end of the year.</p>
