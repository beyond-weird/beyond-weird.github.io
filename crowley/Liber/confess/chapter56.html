    <p>The day after New Year we crossed the Mekong. The river flows through a superb gorge
    with extremely steep banks. Inscriptions of all kinds were carved on the naked cliffs. I
    was aware of a very curious sensation in crossing both this river and the Salween. I can
    only describe it by saying that I seemed to be aware of the genius loci. At night, the
    wild beauty of the scenery was further enhanced. A house in the adjacent fields, several
    acres in extent, caught fire. This warm glow in the midst of the cold vastness of the
    plateau and the stars was very weird; and the silhouettes of the excited peasants who were
    trying to keep the fire from spreading seemed to dance in front of the flickering flames
    gigantically. It was a sort of opium dream of hell.</p>
    <p>Talking of opium, I purchased the necessary apparatus and began to learn to smoke. I
    have already described the fiasco with laudanum in Kandy, and somewhere in Burma I had
    made an equally futile experiment with powered opium, taking thirty grains or so with no
    greater profit than making myself suddenly and painlessly sick. I found smoking the drug
    equally unavailing. I smoked twenty-five pipes in five hours with no result whatever. It
    now appears that I was not inhaling properly; but (for all that) I might have got
    something out of twenty-five pipes! The fact is that I have an idiosyncrasy with regard to
    this drug. I sometimes wonder whether I did not use up all my capacities in that respect
    in a previous incarnation; possibly I was Ko Hs'uen.</p>
    <p>East of the Mekong, the path becomes much less satisfactory, partly owing to the
    geological differences. The whole country between Sha Yang and Chu Tung is across a steep
    wide range. There are innumerable barrancas, with which Mexico had made me familiar. The
    atmosphere of China had by this time begun to soak into my soul. Chinese art explained
    itself as inspired by Chinese nature. There is a vast, free, pale, delicate expanse of
    colour and form, whose lines are visibly determined by the very structure of the globe
    itself. There is an infinite harmony and ease in a journey such as I was making.</p>
    <p>The physical geography is even more vast in its own way that that of the Himalayas; and
    the country seems somehow less definite, less specialized yet equally ineluctable! Small
    vivid patches of colour are associated rather with the works of man that those of nature,
    and if I were to endeavour to give a name to the poetic quintessence of the province of
    Yunnan I should content myself with one word --- space. The Sahara Desert itself and the
    sea do not exceed this district in this respect, for they obtain their effects by what I
    may call the brutal method of sheer magnitude. Here the country is as diversified as
    Cumberland or Switzerland; the effect of immensity, of almost formless immensity, is
    obtained by slightly increasing the scale of quite normal types of hill, forest, lake and
    river, so that man and his ant heaps appear absurdly diminutive by means of delicate
    satire rather than drastic demonstration.</p>
    <p>The character of the journey constantly changes. The steep and desolate range scarred
    by barrancas gave place in a single march to the loveliest wooded hills, yet the slight
    magnification of everything produced a sense of tedium. To enjoy China fully, one must
    allow one's soul to expand to the scale of the scenery and this cannot be cone by ardour,
    as it can among great glaciers. It must be a gently beatific and philosophical adaptation
    of oneself to one's environment. During this month, my poetic genius was lulling itself by
    means of an ineffably beautiful rhythm and rime scheme. On this whole journey I composed
    only tow poems, and for the first time in my life I did not write them down, so to speak,
    automatically; I made up the verses in my head and only took pen when they were complete.
    The second of the poems, &quot;The King Ghost&quot;, is most peculiar psychologically. It
    is as if I had been stripped to the skin of my infinite mentality. It refers to the
    country south of Yunnanfu where the North Wind, or rather North Draught, was the dominant
    demon of the desert.</p>
    <p>These sensuous yet savage uplands conveyed a peculiar spiritual exaltation such as I
    have experienced nowhere else and I translated them into &quot;The Opium Smoker&quot;. In
    all these months I succeeded in completing only tow sections;the other six were invented
    and written down later.</p>
    <p>My diary from Mekong to Talifu is very meagre. The most interesting entry is this, Saw
    child saved from missionary (one eye lost) showing marks of gouging.&quot; I do not
    remember at this distance of time what the incident was. It was nothing unusual. Medical
    missionaries in remote districts tend to become sadistically insane from the boredom of
    their lives. Being brainless, they cannot endure it; and take advantage of their
    circumstances to vivisect the poor far more freely than is done in London hospitals.</p>
    <p>Almost every day blesses the traveller with some delightful geographical surprises. I
    recall, for instance, plodding wearily up a pass of decidedly rugged character. It was
    natural to expect that the other side of the pass would be not very dissimilar. I reached
    the top --- and was stupefied. Instead of looking down into a valley, I saw the ground
    stretching away from me perfectly level, a shallow oblong with a rim of grassy mounds. It
    was highly cultivated land, paddy fields and plantations of white poppy ablaze in the
    sunlight with straight narrow channels of pure pale green and pale blue water marking off
    one meadow from another. Similar surprises constantly</p>
    <p>{487}</p>
    <p>crop up. Their unexpectedness suggests the atmosphere of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>,
    while their formal beauty reminds one of the character visions of the &quot;alchemical
    plant&quot;. A less accurate but perhaps more intelligible analogy is that of the
    curiously luminous, exquisite and irrational landscapes which were used as backgrounds by
    such painters as Mantegna, Memling and Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
    <p>On February 1st we entered a magnificent gorge. The culminating ecstasy is the approach
    to Hsia-Kuan but means of a natural rock bridge amid rock walls. It is as if one had come
    suddenly upon the &quot;dark tower&quot; of Childe Roland, a fortress built by titanic
    gnomes when the planet was a semi-liquit flux of lava.</p>
    <p>The road to Talifu, the second greatest city of the province and the most picturesquely
    situated and historically important, breaks off from the main road across China and runs
    sharply northward for eight miles across wild desolate moorlands. Every weak spot in the
    defences of the wilderness has been seized upon by the industry of the Chinese and turned
    into a glowing patch of cultivated soil. The approach to Tali itself inspires the stranger
    with a certain awe, for life is seen wrestling with death in a supreme spasm. The
    pullulating towers and temples of the town seem literally to quake amid the rotten and
    restless ruins with which they are interspersed. And thereby hangs a tale.</p>
    <p>During eighteen years the province of Yunnan had been the theatre of civil war. Tali
    was the greatest stronghold of the Mohammedans, their opponents being (more or less)
    Mahayana Buddhists. There was not really, I fancy, much to choose between them. The
    outward and visible sign of Islam in these parts is that the door of a Moslem is protected
    from malignant demons by a poster inscribed with sacred characters instead of a
    fierce-looking genius. Also he objects to pork. The cause of the war was in fact either
    that the Mohammedans raided the pork butchers or that thePork Trust wished to extend its
    market by force. I do not remember how many million men were said to have been killed in
    the course of these struggles, but something like two thirds of the whole area of Talifu
    (some estimates gave three quarters) had been razed to the ground in the final storming of
    the stronghold.</p>
    <p>Dr. Clark, the medical missionary of Talifu, received us with great courtesy and
    hospitality. I hound him a sincere and earnest man; more, even an enlightened man, so far
    as it is possible for a missionary to be so; but that is not very far. I found him totally
    ignorant both of canonical Buddhism and of local beliefs. I tried to point out to him that
    he could hardly hope to show the natives the errors of their way of thinking, unless he
    knew hat that was. But he declined to see the point. He was so cocksure that his own sect
    of Christianity held truth in utter purity and entirety that he could not imagine</p>
    <p>{488}</p>
    <p>that the Chinese had any way of thinking at all. He regarded their refusal to follow
    him as a mixture of sheer dullness and sheer wickedness.</p>
    <p>I forget the figures with regard to the converts at Talifu. In Yunnanfu the staff of
    six missionaries claimed four converts in four years and I imagine that these four were
    rice Christians at that. The truth seems to be that there are two main types of
    non-Christian religion. The first may be described as philosophical. In this category I
    place the more intelligent classes of Buddhist, Hindu and Mohammedan. To convert these
    people it would obviously be necessary to show them that Christianity offers them a more
    satisfactory explanation of the universe than their own; and not only have I never met a
    missionary who was capable of doing this, but not even one who admitted the desirability
    of it or attempting it.</p>
    <p>The other type is the superstitious to which belong the fetish- worshipping varieties
    of Buddhist and Hindu and pagan (Equatorial Africa and Polynesia) with their paraphernalia
    of miracles, sacrifices, priestcraft, penance, vicarious atonements and the like. It is up
    to the missionary to show that the Christian form of such things is superior to the local
    variety and the difficulty is usually insuperable. The native can produce much bigger and
    more improbable miracles, a much more terrifying demonology, a far more fascinating
    pantheon, with a more alluring (and, so to say, actual) ritual than even the papist. The
    native perhaps seems little reason why he should not accept Christianity, but certainly
    none at all why he should discard his own beliefs which seem to him more vivid and more
    veracious, better adapted and better attested than the new. It is in fact only among the
    very lowest class of superstitious savages that Christianity makes any headway. Where
    Christian and Moslem missions are in direct rivalry, Islam collects the higher and
    Christianity the lower sections of the society.</p>
    <p>Disappointed about learning Chinese ideas at first hand in this remote region, I hoped
    at least to get available information about the effects of opium smoking. Dr. Clark
    informed me that these effects were appalling --- the usual scaremonger story. He said it
    was the curse of the country and that his clinic was full of victims; &quot;Hundreds and
    hundreds and hundreds,&quot; he groaned, &quot;physical and moral wrecks from the
    habit.&quot; &quot;I should like to see one,&quot; I replied with the appropriate sigh and
    shudder. &quot;Well, you have only to come down to my clinic any morning,&quot; re
    returned: &quot;there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.&quot; He groaned again.
    Well, I went down to his clinic and he went on groaning that there were hundreds and
    hundreds and hundreds, and I went on sighing that I should like to see one.</p>
    <p>During my whole journey, I never saw a man whom I could call definitely the worse for
    opium. My wife's chair coolies were cases in point. They had smoked from twelve years old
    or thereabouts; and when I say smoked, I mean smoked. Every night on reaching the inn,
    temple or camp, as the case</p>
    <p>{489}</p>
    <p>may be, they cooked their rice and started to smoke directly they had eaten it,
    continuing till they went to sleep. In the morning again they smoked before starting. The
    chair (with Rose and the baby, and the books which I like to have handy to read at odd
    moments without unpacking my valise) weighed over one hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
    <p>Each man had therefore to carry forty pounds. Not much, but a load of this kind is very
    different to dead weight. Each man had to keep in step with the rest and shake the chair
    as little as possible; and this over rough hilly toads, often slippery with mud; perhaps
    against a head wind, in which case the furniture of the chair offered a large surface. One
    of these coolies, the heaviest the most inveterate smoker of the quartet, cannot have been
    less than sixty years old. I timed the men under the worst conditions; a road mostly
    uphill, driving sleet --- half a gale --- dead ahead, streaming slippery cobbles, and they
    did eight miles without a rest in two hours dead. If those men were &quot;physical wrecks
    from abuse of opium&quot;, I should like to see the animal in his undamaged state!</p>
    <p>There are of course men who have injured their health by opium; and one can see such on
    the coast, where the affair is complicated with alcohol and European vices. But on the
    whole, the search for an opium fiend in China is on all fours with the search for the man
    with tobacco amblyopia in England. Consular reports and independent medical opinion are
    unanimous that opium smoking does little or no harm to the Chinese. Dr. Thomas Stevenson,
    in his special article in Quain's <em>Dictionary of Medicine</em>, sits on the fence as
    follows: &quot;Great differences of opinion exist as to the pernicious or other effects of
    opium smoking. Some would have us believe that the practice is pernicious, not to say
    deadly; but debasing it often is. The pictures drawn as to its effects are evidently
    coloured by the bias of the observer. On the other hand some would persuade us that the
    practice is harmless, not to say beneficial. Doubtless neither view is absolutely correct,
    and whilst opium smoking is pernicious, the evils have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;
    These remarks strike me on the whole as fair.</p>
    <p>I have myself made extensive and elaborate studies of the effects of indulgence in
    stimulants and narcotics. (See my <em>The Psychology of
    Hashish</em></a>, <em>Cocaine</em>, <em>The Green Goddess</em></a>,
    <em>The Diary of a Drug Fiend</em> etc.) I have a vast quantity of unpublished data. I am
    convinced that personal idiosyncrasy counts for more in this matter than all the other
    factors put together. The philosophical phlegmatic temperament of the Chinese finds opium
    sympathetic. But the effect of opium on a vivacious, nervous, mean, cowardly Frenchman, on
    an Englishman with his congenital guilty conscience or on an American with his passion for
    pushing everything to extremes is very different; the drug is almost certain to produce
    disaster.</p>
    <p>Similarly, hashish, which excites certain types of Arab, Indian, Malay or</p>
    <p>{490}</p>
    <p>Mexican to indiscriminate murder, whose motive is often religious insanity, has no such
    effect on quietly disposed, refined and philosophical people, especially if they happen to
    possess the faculty of self-analysis. In brief, generalization about such exceptionally
    subtle problems is a snare.</p>
    <p>One one point, however, I must admit to thinking and feeling somewhat strongly. Dr.
    Clark told me that the missionaries treated the opium habit with injections of morphia;
    and in other parts of China I learnt that they had taught the Chinese, with the same
    laudable intention, to sniff cocaine.</p>
    <p>The British government has acted with incredible folly. The economic prosperity of
    India is largely bound up with the export of opium. Whilst I was in China a petition
    against &quot;the accursed traffic&quot; had been presented. It was signed by many of the
    most eminent and enlightened men in China, to say nothing of the sister-in-law (I think it
    was) of the emperor whom they had persuaded to declare herself a Christian so as to have a
    foot in the enemy's camp. The fact was the most of the petitioners were themselves opium
    growers whose business was damaged by the competition of the Indian product. In the same
    way, of course, many of the missionaries were employed by the manufacturers of morphia and
    cocaine to introduce these drugs instead of the practically harmless and even beneficial
    YEN.</p>
    <p>China has been the most civilized country in the world; from the time of Lao Tzu and
    Confucius, the fringe of its culture has been torn by the claws of commerce, but it will
    survive the collapse of Europe. And in Yunnan the contamination of the foreign devil had
    not gone very far; in fact, it had not yet reached the asymptote of its own curve.
    However, the clearing of the ground had long been complete. There are practically no wild
    animals in the province. I did not even see one of those famous pheasants which I was
    anxious to shoot. I had hitherto bagged nothing but occasional pigeons for the pot.</p>
    <p>At Talifu, nevertheless, there is great sport to be had. From the great deserts to the
    north, across the mighty mountains, migrate many magnificent birds, especially cranes and
    geese. I went out from the city northwards, for these birds migrate at this time of the
    year from the terrible highlands of Central Asia to the warm valleys and plains of the low
    country. I used to lie behind an embankment which was perhaps at one time part of the
    fortifications of the city, and shoot them as they came over. It was very difficult sport.
    The birds flew very high and at a tremendous pace. Some idea may be gained from the fact
    that a grouse shot clean through the head would fall as much as a quarter of a mile from
    the embankment. The geese are admirable eating, but the flesh of the crane is very coarse
    and fishy.</p>
    <p>Talking of shooting, I may as well sum up the subject by saying that the part of China
    through which I travelled offers very poor sport on the whole; there is usually the chance
    of a pigeon for the pot, but that is all one can get</p>
    <p>{491}</p>
    <p>without taking a great deal of pins. I had heard so much of the gorgeous beauty of the
    Chinese pheasant and looked forward to bagging a few, but never so much as saw one during
    the whole march. As for quadrupeds, I never set eyes on as much as a rabbit or a marmot,
    let alone a deer. Foxes abound; but they did not come my way. Chinese civilization is so
    systematic that wild animals have been abolished on principle. That at least is the only
    explanation that suggests itself to me.</p>
    <p>We had been told that we should find ample supplies of fresh food of all sorts
    everywhere. Nothing could have been farther from the truth. We could get no fresh mild,
    the Chinese considering it obscene to extract it; but strangely enough, in even the
    smallest villages, we were able to buy an excellent brand of evaporated cream which some
    enterprising drummer had managed to unload along the track. There was no mutton to be had;
    and it was only seldom that we managed to but a goat or kid. Poultry and eggs were fairly
    plentiful in most places; rice of an inferior quality and the most suspicious-looking kind
    of pork were the staple food of the people. Flour was rarely available and of course there
    was no butter.</p>
    <p>Salama was in great distress at the difference between the local rice and the Indian
    variety to which he was accustomed, while as a Moslem he abhorred pork. I too would not
    eat it, valuing the respect in which he held me, as a sahib who partook not of the
    abominations of my race. Luckily, distrusting my informant, I had supplied myself with a
    considerable stock of canned provisions before starting, and I increased this at Tengyueh,
    buying some of Litton's stores from his widow. Even so, we were running very short before
    we reached Yunnanfu.</p>
    <p>At this hour, seventeen years later, I recall almost more vividly than any other
    incident of the journey, an absurd little tragedy in this connection. We had some tins of
    coffee and milk, and we had come to the last portion of the last tin. We treasured it for
    days, looking forward to enjoying it on some great occasion as never an epicure looked
    forward to a bottle of rare wine. The moment came, we prepared the great drink with almost
    reverential care. And just as we were going to drink it, my wife shifted her position and
    spilled it. It would be hopeless to try to express the bitterness of our disappointment.
    Stay-at-home people can form no idea of the strength of the obsession which trifles
    impose. Conrad in &quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot; tells of a murder and suicide
    beginning in a quarrel between two close friends, traders up-river, over a few lumps of
    sugar.</p>
    <p>During our short stay in Talifu, we saw the biggest pageant with which the Chinese
    welcome spring. I did not know enough Chinese to understand the details of the ceremony;
    and the missionaries regarded the while business as a blasphemous pagan orgy from which
    all righteous people should avert their gaze. I could see clearly, however, that the
    central figure was an ox. He was</p>
    <p>{492}</p>
    <p>evidently the hero of the occasion because he was going to help them out with their
    ploughing. It was a gay, spontaneous, harmless piece of merriment; to see idolatry in it
    is sheer morbid prejudice.</p>
    <p>We left Tali on February 6th and got back to the main road. The following day was
    without interest, but on the eighth, the latter part of the march led through a delightful
    valley of the most surprising beauty. It was an altogether new type of scenery. China is
    full of these delicious revelations. It has always some new delicate splendour to show the
    traveller. The variety is infinite, not as Alpine peaks or Scottish locks differ, merely
    in detail; in China, one is always discovering a totally strange fairyland. The spirit of
    a man is reborn with every such vision. It is not even possible to compare and contrast
    these beauties; each is entirely individual, lord of its own atmosphere; the points of
    similarity with other places such as geological formations, the flora, the villages and
    the people seem to possess infinitesimal importance.</p>
    <p>On the ninth there was a novelty of another kind. The dignity of Johnny White as
    interpreter entitled him to ride on horseback; but naturally he had to be content with a
    somewhat sorry screw, wile my own pony was a fairly decent animal. He thought the time
    ripe to attempt to force me to &quot;lose face&quot;: that is, to become an object of
    ridicule to the coolies. If he had succeeded, I need hardly point out, there would have
    been and end of all discipline and we should probably have been robbed and murdered in
    short order. His idea was to start out ahead of us on my pony. I did not find out what had
    happened for some time.</p>
    <p>When I did, I set out on foot at top speed after him. In two or three hours I came up
    with the culprit. As luck would have it, he was crossing a steep hillside; below the path
    were gigantic thorn bushes. I came up quietly and unperceived, put my left hand under his
    right foot and with one deft jerk flung him from the saddle into a thorn bush. It was
    quite impossible for him to extricate himself, the bush being very large and elastic, the
    thorns long and persuasive. So I waited, peacefully smoking, until the coolies began to
    arrive, when I got up and gave him a whack with my whalebone hip as each man passed. When
    all had gone by, I mounted my pony and followed. Johnny White was rescued by a subsequent
    caravan and turned up during the halt for tiffin. It was not I who had &quot;lost
    face&quot; with the coolies! And I had no more trouble of any kind for the rest of the
    journey to Yunnanfu.</p>
    <p>This march was very long and dull, its monotony relieved only by a fine view of lakes
    and hills. But the next six days were utterly uninteresting. Not until the sixteenth did
    the featureless plateau give way to the grand wooded gorges which caress Tatz'assa Tang.
    The village has no good inn, so we went on to a lovely glade which afforded a delightful
    and romantic place for a camp. I fell ill, I don't know of what, for the next three days.
    Whatever scenery there may have been I was too sick to observe.</p>
    <p>{493}</p>
    <p>We reached Yunnanfu on the twentieth. Mr. Wilkinson, the consul general, wrote that he
    was very sorry not to be able to offer hospitality, but the Bengali blackguard of Tengyueh
    had pout in a complaint that I had assaulted him, so that his relations with me must be
    strictly official until the matter was settled. We found accommodation in the <em>dépendance</em>
    of the French Hospital; an admirable place run by a Dr. Barbezieux and a Parisian head
    nurse, both of them really too much accomplished and delightful to be wasted on such a
    cesspool as this city. I called on Wilkinson and told him my side of the story of Litton's
    death. Steps were taken to make it hot for the doctor; but as my assault was not denied,
    the consul general had to regard it as a technical offence, which was duly purged by the
    payment of a small fine.</p>
    <p>The approach to Yunnanfu is worthy of remark. The city is situated in the centre of a
    plain ringed round by hills. The suggestion is almost of a crater, like Mexico City. There
    is no adequate drainage for the rainfall. The town itself seems, from a distance, to be
    perched on a huge mound some fifty to a hundred feet in height. But on investigation one
    discovers that this mound is composed of the refuse of the city; the accumulation of
    centuries of indescribable dirt. It inclined one to accept the theory that bubonic plague
    first appeared here and spread hence throughout the world.</p>
    <p>On the twenty-third I paid the inevitable visit to the inevitable missionary. This
    specimen was more bigoted and less intelligent than any I had previously met. I had not
    thought this possible. Six missionaries in four years working in this populous city did
    one even claim more than four converts. They attributed their failure, of course, to the
    personal activity of the devil. It never occurred to them that there might be something
    wrong with their methods. Roughly speaking, any man with energy and enthusiasm ought to be
    able to bring at least a dozen others round to his opinion in the course of a year, no
    matter how absurd that opinion might be. We see every day in politics, in business, in
    social life, large masses of people brought to embrace the most revolutionary ideas,
    sometimes within a few days. It is all a question of getting hold of them in the right way
    and working on their weak points.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed my ten days in Yunnanfu immensely. I picked up quite a lot of old prints at
    prices so low that I could hardly believe my ears. The city had never been ransacked by
    bric-&#133;-brac hounds.</p>
    <p>Having settled my little official affair with the consul general, we were free to
    become excellent friends. He was a distinguished and delightful man, though I could well
    understand that Litton had been a thorn in his side. He wanted everything done elegantly
    and correctly, while Litton cared nothing for routine. He was always imposing his tameless
    personal genius on the province, with the result that he was always achieving unexpected
    successes when Wilkinson expected him to be filling up forms and docketing reports.</p>
    <p>For various reasons, I decided to abandon my original design to descend</p>
    <p>{494}</p>
    <p>the Yangtze; for one thing, the delays at Bhamo and Tengyueh had robbed me of time. I
    was anxious to get to Europe in good time to prepare a new expedition to Kangchenjunga for
    1907. I had the mountain, so to speak, in my pocket. A part of average strength could make
    as certain of strolling to the top as if it were the Strand. I decided, therefore, to turn
    south and make for Tonkin.</p>
    <p>On March 2nd, after breakfast and tiffin with the consul general, who was unfortunately
    short of stores and could only spare us a couple of tins of butter, we started along the
    cobbled track, lively with cherry blossoms. The walking soon became very difficult; the
    paths were rough, wet and slippery. On the fourth we came to a pass in the mountains
    guarded southwards by fine cliffs. At nightfall we reached a lake by whose side we camped.
    The weather for the first five days of this journey was bitterly cold. The wind, shifting
    from south-east to south-west, literally took the skin off our faces, even mine, which I
    had thought inured to all the possible devilishness of nature.</p>
    <p>Later, this wind dropped and was replaced by a much more deadly device; a steady
    draught from the north was infernally icy as when it started its career in the ghastly
    deserts of Siberia. It had the same quality as the north wind which we had on Chogo Ri; it
    took no notice whatever of poshtin (coats lined with sheepskin), sweaters, flannel shirts
    and vests. One felt as if one were absolutely naked. There was no shelter from it. One
    might crouch behind a wall or a house, but although that prevented the wind from blowing
    on one, it did not hinder the draught from drawing from one. The effect was just as bad;
    it simply exhausted one bodily and mentally; it sucked out all vitality and courage.</p>
    <p>On the sixth we came out suddenly on the edge of a plateau with a descent of some three
    thousand feet in front of us, through a fine gorge. But I was hardly in a mood to
    appreciate nature. For three days we had practically nothing to eat but soup and
    Worchester Sauce. When we asked for eggs, we created something not far shot of a scandal.
    Even rice was scanty. The villages on this route are few, far apart and poverty-stricken.</p>
    <p>Of one thing we had plenty --- tea. I had heard marvellous stories of the so-called
    &quot;brick tea&quot; that hails from these parts; and laid in a large stock of various
    brands to take back to England. The bricks are usually in the shape of a flat cone,
    somewhat hollow beneath. It reminds one of the straw hats of Japanese coolies. The
    diameter is from eight inches to one foot and the thicknesses from two to four inches. The
    flavour is excellent, very subtle and aromatic; but it possesses a property not usually
    associated with tea, the desirability of which depends on the physiological condition of
    the drinker, for it acts as a powerful laxative and a purgative when strongly infused and
    consumed in excess. When I reached home and could compare it with the finest caravan</p>
    <p>{495}</p>
    <p>teas, its flavour seemed less admirable, yet it retained its distinction and was always
    worth its place in the caddy as a curiosity. For myself, too, it was a potent spell to
    evoke most vivid memories of this weirdly fascinating journey.</p>
    <p>To return to the march to Mengtsz. There is little to see that is impressive. My one
    memory is of a big pagoda perched on the crest of a mountain that looked as if it had been
    cleft in twain by a wizard. I was heartily glad on the tenth when Mengtsz came into sight;
    a French outpost with all the civilization, culture and cooking that heart of man can
    wish. The inspector of customs, Mr. Brewitt Taylor, very kindly asked us to stay in his
    house, though at first sight he could hardly believe that I was an Englishman. The journey
    had reduced me to rags; I had no chance of washing or trimming my beard; the skin of my
    face was torn by the wind. I must have looked simply frightful. (I still do.)</p>
    <p>We only stayed three days in Mengtsz in spite of the attractions of the little French
    colony. Everyone invited us everywhere, including a garden party where I played lawn
    tennis for the first time in ten years. I will play once more --- when I return.</p>
    <p>There is one ghastly tale to be told. The French intended to run a railway up to Yunnan
    to extend their sphere of influence. They had surveyed the route satisfactorily and
    proceeded to import eight thousand coolies. With unbelievable stupidity, they got them
    from Manchuria. Naturally enough, the men could not stand the climate, especially as no
    proper accommodations had been provided to house them. In six months only five hundred
    were left.</p>
    <p>On March 14th we left Mengtsz for Manhao on the Red River --- three days' easy
    travelling. The very first night, an unpleasant incident took place. Wilkinson had made me
    promise on no account to strike any of the men but to rely on him to punish any misconduct
    when they returned to Yunnanfu. It seemed as if they knew of this compact and the Great
    God Wilkinson seemed very far off to them. I could feel instinctively that the respect,
    akin to godly fear, which I had previously inspired was less powerful as an inhibition.</p>
    <p>We slept on the fourteenth at a seerai, dirty and entirely comfortless. I paid the host
    more than liberally; but he was insolent and I had no means of abating the nuisance. This
    emboldened my own coolies to be mutinous; and in the course of a squabble with my wife (I
    being ahead out of sight) one of them struck the baby. I ground my teeth; but resolved to
    keep my temper and my promise to the consul.</p>
    <p>The fifteenth was a long march over muddy cobbles full of holes where my horse
    constantly slipped an stumbled. It blew great guns and poured blue cats all day. We
    reached a village with an alleged European hotel; the &quot;Sino-France&quot;,</p>
    <p>{496}</p>
    <p>a wattled hotel, unspeakably foul; the worst place I had yet struck in all Asia.</p>
    <p>Manhao is a fine village situated on the banks of the Red River --- a torrent which
    competes with the Salween for pre-eminence in deadliness, both from disease and demons.
    The Chinese refuse to sleep even a single night in the valley; but I saw no cachectics in
    the village any more than I had seen victims of opium elsewhere.</p>
    <p>The Red River at this point runs through a deep and narrow gorge. We found it
    stiflingly hot, after our long exposure to the icy winds of the plateau. I had hired a
    dup-out to take us down the rapids to Hokow, and her I saw my chance of getting even with
    the coolies. Having got everything aboard, I proceeded to pay the head man the exact sum
    due to him --- less certain fines. Then the band played. They started to threaten the crew
    and prevented them from casting off the ropes. They incited the bystanders to take their
    part; and presently we had thirty or forty yelling maniacs preparing to stone us. I got
    out my .400 Cordite Express and told Salama to wade ashore and untie the ropes. But like
    all Kashmiris, thoughtlessly brave in the face of elemental dangers, he was an absolute
    coward when opposed to men. I told him that unless be obeyed at once I would begin by
    shooting him. He saw I meant it and did his duty; while I covered the crowd with my rifle.
    Not a stone was thrown; three minutes later the fierce current had swept us away from the
    rioters.</p>
    <p>The real danger now began. This was the only part of the journey where we encountered
    any serious risk of disaster. The Red River, though broad and deep, has all the
    characteristics of the wildest mountain torrents. It falls in a succession of dangerous
    rapids, all the more perilous for the sudden sharp curves of the channel. At almost every
    corner we saw one or more wrecks, a far from reassuring spectacle. I was given to
    understand, however, that disaster rarely overtook boats going down stream. It is when
    they are being towed by insufficient power up the rapids that they get out of control and
    are dashed upon the rocks. For all that, we managed to hit two nasty snags in the course
    of the day; one of them ripped a hole in us amidships; but the men managed to stop the
    leak with tarpaulin nailed in place by short boards with extraordinary speed and
    efficiency. They were evidently well accustomed to similar jobs.</p>
    <p>We reached Hokow on the eighteenth and struck a forlorn Englishman who gave us tiffin
    and dined with us. We all got gloriously drunk celebrating the success of a journey which
    in the opinion of all reasonable people was a crazy escapade, doomed from the first to
    disaster. Another bubble had burst! The awe-inspiring adventure had proved as safe as a
    bus ride from the Bank to Battersea.</p>
