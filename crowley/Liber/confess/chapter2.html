    <p>If troubles arose in the outer world, they were regarded as the beginning of the
    fulfilment of the prophecies in Daniel, Matthew and Revelation. But it was understood
    implicitly that England was specially favoured by God on account of the breach with Rome.
    The child, who, at this period, was called by the dreadful name Alick, supposed it to be a
    law of nature that Queen Victoria would never die and that consols would never go below
    par.</p>
    <p>Crowley remembers, as if he had seen it yesterday, the dining-room and the ceremony of
    family prayers after breakfast. He remembers the order in which the family and the
    servants sat. A chapter of the Bible was read, each person present taking a verse in turn.
    At four years old he could read perfectly well. The strange thing about this is not so
    much his precocity as the fact that he was much less interested in the biblical narratives
    than in the long Hebrew names. One of his father's favourite sermons was based on the
    fifth chapter of Genesis; long as the patriarchs lived, they all died in the end. From
    this he would argue that his hearers would die too; they had therefore better lose no time
    in making sure of heaven. But the interest of Alick was in the sound of the names
    themselves --- Enoch, Arphaxad, Mahaleel. He often wonders whether this curious trait was
    symptomatic of his subsequent attainments in poetry, or whether it indicates the
    attraction which the Hebrew Cabbala was to have for him later on.</p>
    <p>With regard to the question of salvation, by the way, the theory of the exclusive
    Plymouth Brethren was peculiar, and somewhat trying to a logical mind. They held
    predestination as rigidly as Calvin, yet this nowise interfered with complete freewill.
    The crux was faith in Christ, apparently more or less intellectual, but, since &quot;the
    devils also believe and tremble&quot;, it had to be supplemented by a voluntary acceptance
    of Christ as one's personal saviour. This being so, the question arose whether Roman
    Catholics, Anglicans or even Nonconformists could possibly be saved. The general feeling
    seems to have been that it was impossible for anyone who was once actually saved to be
    lost, whatever he did<strong>1</strong>. But it was, of course, beyond human power to
    determine whether any given individual had or had not found salvation. This, however, was
    clear: that any teaching or acceptance of false</p>
    <p>{41}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">&quot;Of those that thou gavest me have I lost not one, except the son of
        perdition.&quot; In view of predestination, &quot;those&quot; means all the elect and not
        merely the Eleven, as the unenlightened might suppose.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>doctrine must be met by excommunication. The leaders of the Brethren were necessarily
    profound theologians. There being no authority of any kind, any brother soever might
    enunciate any doctrine soever at any time, and this anarchy had already resulted, before
    the opening of our story, in the division of the Brethren into two great sects: the Open
    and the Exclusive.</p>
    <p>Philip Gosse, the father of Edmund Gosse, was a leader among the Open Brethren, who
    differed from the Exclusive Brethren, at first, only by tolerating, at the Lord's table,
    the presence of &quot;Professed Christians&quot; not definitely affiliated to themselves.
    Edmund Gosse has described his father's attitude in <em>Father and Son</em>. Much of what
    he wrote taxes the credulity of the reader. Such narrowness and bigotry as that of Philip
    Gosse seemed beyond belief. Yet Edward Crowley regarded Philip Gosse as likely to be
    damned for latitudinariansm! No one who loved the Lord Jesus in his heart could be so
    careless of his Saviour's honour as to &quot;break bread&quot;<strong>1</strong> with a
    man who might be holding unscriptural opinions.</p>
    <p>Readers of <em>Father and Son</em> will remember the incident of the Christmas turkey,
    secretly bought by Mr. Gosse's servants and thrown into the dustbin by him in the spirit
    of Moses destroying the golden calf. For the Brethren rightly held Christmas to be a pagan
    festival. They sent no Christmas cards and destroyed any that might be sent to them by
    thoughtless or blaspheming &quot;goats&quot;. Not to disappoint Alick, who liked turkey,
    the family had that bird for lunch on the 24th and 26th of December. The idea was to
    &quot;avoid even the appearance of evil&quot;; there was nothing actually wrong in eating
    turkey on Christmas Day; for pagan idols are merely wood and stone --- the work of men's
    hands. But one must not let others suppose that one is complying with heathen customs.</p>
    <p>Another early reminiscence. On February 29th, 1808, Alick was taken to see the dead
    body of his sister, Grace Mary Elizabeth<strong>2</strong>, who had only lived five hours.
    The incident made a curious impression on him. He did not see why he should be disturbed
    so uselessly. He couldn't do any good; the child was dead; it was none of his business.
    This attitude continued through his life. He has never attended any funeral<strong>3</strong>
    But that of his father, which he did not mind doing, as he felt himself to be the real
    centre of interest. But when others have died, though in two cases at least his heart was
    torn as if by a wild beast, and his life actually blighted for months and years by the
    catastrophe, he has always turned away from the necrological facts and the customary
    orgies. It may be that he has a deep-seated innate conviction that the connection of a
    person with his body is purely symbolic. But there is also the feeling that the fact of
    death destroys all possible interest; the disaster is</p>
    <p>{42}<ol>
      <li>i.e. sit at the communion table.</li>
      <li><em>What</em> a name!</li>
      <li>With one notable exception, at which he officiated.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>irreparable, it should be forgotten as soon as possible. He would not even join the
    search party after the Kangchenjunga accident. What object was there in digging frozen
    corpses from under an avalanche? Dead bodies themselves do not repel him; he is as
    interested in dissecting rooms as in anything else. When he met the dead body of Consul
    Litton, he turned back, knowing the man was dead. But when the corpse was brought to
    Tengyueh, he assisted unflinchingly at the inquiry, because in this instance there was an
    object in ascertaining the cause of death.</p>
    <p>One other group of incidents of early childhood. The family went to the west of England
    for the summer. Alick remembers Monmouth, or rather Monmouth Castle. It is curious that,
    in the act of remembering this for the purpose of this book, he was obsessed by the idea
    that there could not be such a place as Monmouth; the name seemed fantastic. It was
    confused in his mind with &quot;Monster&quot; and &quot;Mammoth&quot;, and it was some
    hours before he could convince himself of its reality. He remembers staying in a farm some
    distance from the road and has a very vague impression of becoming acquainted with such
    animals as ducks and pigs. Much more clearly arises the vision of himself on a pony with
    people walking each side. He remembers falling off, starting to yell and being carried up
    to the house by the frightened governess (or whoever it was) in charge of him. This event
    had a tragic result. He ought to have been put back on the pony and made to conquer his
    fears. As it was, he has never been able to feel at home on horseback, though he has
    ridden thousands of miles, many of them over really dangerous country.</p>
    <p>On the other hand --- subconscious memory of previous incarnations, or the Eastern soul
    of him, or the fact that he took to it after he had learned the foolishness of fear? ---
    he was from the first perfectly at home on a camel. And this despite the fact that these
    animals act like highly placed officials and even --- if scabby -- like consuls, and look
    (when old) like English ladies engaged in good works. (There is much of the vulture in the
    type of head.)</p>
    <p>One incident connected with this journey is of extraordinary interest as throwing a
    light on future events. Walking with his father in a field, whose general aspect he
    remembers perfectly well to this day, his attention was called to a clump of nettles and
    he was warned that they would sting if he touched them. He does not remember what he
    answered, but whatever it was it elicited from his father the question, &quot;Will you
    take my word for it or would your rather learn by experience?&quot; He replied, &quot;I
    would rather learn by experience,&quot; and plunged head foremost into the clump.</p>
    <p>This summer was marked by two narrow escapes. He remembers being seated beside the
    driver of some carriage with what seemed to him an extraordinarily tall box, though this
    impression may mean merely that he was a very small boy. It was going down hill on a road
    that curved across a steep slope of very green grass. He remembers the grinding of the
    brakes. Suddenly</p>
    <p>{43}</p>
    <p>his father jumped out of the carriage and cried to the driver that a wheel was coming
    off. The only trace which this left in later life is that he has always disliked riding in
    unusual vehicles unless himself in control. He became a reckless cyclist and motorist, but
    he was nervous for a long while with automobiles unless at the wheel.</p>
    <p>The last event of this period occurred at a railway station. He remembers its general
    appearance and that of the little family group. A porter, staggering under a heavy trunk,
    slid it suddenly off his back. It missed crushing the boy by a hair's breadth. He does not
    remember whether he was snatched away, or anything else, except his father's exclamation,
    &quot;His guardian angel was watching over him.&quot; It seems possible that this early
    impression determined his course in later life when he came to take up Magick; for the one
    document which gripped him was <em>The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage</em>,
    in which the essential work is &quot;To obtain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy
    Guardian Angel&quot;.</p>
    <p>It is very important to mention that the mind of the child was almost abnormally
    normal. He showed no tendency to see visions, as even commonplace children often do. The
    Bible was his only book at this period; but neither the narrative nor the poetry made any
    deep impression on him. He was fascinated by the mysteriously prophetic passages,
    especially those in Revelation. The Christianity in his home was entirely pleasant to him,
    and yet his sympathies were with the opponents of heaven. He suspects obscurely that this
    was partly an instinctive love of terrors. The Elders and the harps seemed tame. He
    preferred the Dragon, the False Prophet, the Beast and the Scarlet Woman, as being more
    exciting. He revelled in the descriptions of torment. One may suspect, moreover, a strain
    of congenital masochism. He liked to imagine himself in agony; in particular, he liked to
    identify himself with the Beast whose number is the number of a man, six hundred and three
    score six. One can only conjecture that it was the mystery of the number which determined
    this childish choice.</p>
    <p>Many of the memories even of very early childhood seem to be those of a quite adult
    individual. It is as if the mind and body of the boy were a mere medium being prepared for
    the expression of a complete soul already in existence. (The word medium is here used in
    almost exactly the same sense as in spiritualism.) This feeling is very strong; and
    implies an unshakable conviction that the facts are as suggested above. The explanation
    can hardly fail to imply the existence of an immanent spirit (the true self) which uses
    incarnations, and possibly many other means, from time to time in order to observe the
    universe at a particular point of focus, much as a telescope resolves a nebula.</p>
    <p>The congenital masochism of which we have spoken demands further investigation. All his
    life he has been almost unduly sensitive to pain, physical,</p>
    <p>{44}</p>
    <p>mental and moral. There is no perversion in him which makes it enjoyable, yet the
    phantasy of desiring to be hurt has persisted in his waking imagination, though it never
    manifests itself in his dreams. It is probable that these peculiarities are connected with
    certain curious anatomical facts. While his masculinity is above the normal, both
    physiologically and as witnessed by his powerful growth of beard, he has certain
    well-marked feminine characteristics. Not only are his limbs as slight and graceful as a
    girl's but his breasts are developed to quite abnormal degree. There is thus a sort of
    hermaphroditism in his physical structure; and this is naturally expressed in his mind.
    But whereas, in most similar cases, the feminine qualities appear at the expense of
    manhood, in him they are added to a perfectly normal masculine type. The principal effect
    has been to enable him to understand the psychology of women, to look at any theory with
    comprehensive and impartial eyes, and to endow him with maternal instincts on spiritual
    planes. He has thus been able to beat the women he has met at their own game and emerge
    from the battle of sex triumphant and scatheless. He has been able to philosophize about
    nature from the standpoint of a complete human being; certain phenomena will always be
    unintelligible to men as such, others, to women as such. He, by being both at once, has
    been able to formulate a view of existence which combines the positive and the negative,
    the active and the passive, in a single identical equation. Finally, intensely as the
    savage male passion to create has inflamed him, it has been modified by the gentleness and
    conservatism of womanhood. Again and again, in the course of this history, we shall find
    his actions determined by this dual structure. Similar types have no doubt existed
    previously, but none such has been studied. Only in the light of Weininger and Freud<strong>1</strong>
    is it possible to select and interpret the phenomena. The present investigation should be
    of extraordinary ethical value, for it must be a rare circumstance that a subject with
    such abnormal qualities so clearly marked should have trained himself to intimate
    self-analysis and kept an almost daily record of his life and work extending over nearly a
    quarter of a century<strong>2</strong>.</p>

        Cabbala --- the Children's table from which Freud and Weininger ate of a few crumbs that
        fell.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2">It should be added that the apparently masochistic stigmata disappeared
        entirely at puberty; their relics are observable only when he is depressed physically.
        That is, they are wholly symptoms of physiological malaise.</font></li>
