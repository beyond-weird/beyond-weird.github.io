    <p>I found that my long abstinence from magical practices had injured my powers. I resumed
    elementary drill and soon got back to my old form. For one thing, my protection against
    mosquitoes had worn off. I spent a night motionless, offering my body to them and
    concentrating on the thought that they were equally divine with myself. I forced myself to
    love them, so that in union with them the apparent differences between us might vanish in
    ecstasy. I compelled my body to accept, to welcome and even to long for their bites, as
    being acts of love whereby I nourished their lives. In the morning, though badly bitten
    all over, there was no inflammation whatever; and from that time on they never bit me at
    all.</p>
    <p>I soon recovered the powers of Pratyahara and Dharana. My mind became still; the impact
    of impressions ceased to obsess me, I became free of the illusion of the reality of
    material things. All events became equally indifferent, exquisite phrases in an eternal
    symphony. (Imagine listening to Beethoven with the prepossession that C is a good note and
    F a bad one; yet this is exactly the stand point from which all uninitiates contemplate
    the universe. Obviously, they miss the music.)</p>
    <p>I soon began to acquire the Magical Memory to recall my past incarnations. I refuse to
    assert any theory of what this really means. All memory is a re-awakening of ancient
    impressions. What I was really doing was penetrating to the deeper layers of my
    unconscious self. When, therefore, I remember my life as Cagliostro or Pope Alexander the
    Sixth, I am quite willing to interpret the experience as a dreamlike imagination, a
    dramatization of certain deeper elements in my character. I may, however, argue on the
    other side, that my present life is, almost equally, an artistic representation of my
    nature. There are also some fairly strong arguments for the actuality of such memories.
    Events in the past sometimes throw light on the present. For instance, when I came to
    remember what had happened to me in Rome, Naples and Paris, I understood certain obscure
    instinctive feelings about those cities which had always been unintelligible,<strong>1</strong>
    and were in direct conflict with my conscious ideas about them. I will summarize as
    follows:</p>
    <p>Shortly before the time of Mohammed, I was present at a Council of</p>
    <p>{838}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Revising this chapter, in Tunis, my Ape reminded me of how much of these
        past lives was spent in Sicily and North Africa; and that, when my present life came to an
        end (of a sort; all the forces which had till then acted upon me having been worked out) I
        drifted quite aimlessly to that part of the world, as if my unconsciousness, its labours
        accomplished, had automatically turned its face towards home!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Masters. The critical question was the policy to be adopted in order to help humanity.
    A small minority, including myself, was hot for positive action; definite movements were
    to be made; in particular, the mysteries were to be revealed. The majority, especially the
    Asiatic Masters, refused even to discuss the proposal. They contemptuously abstained from
    voting, as if to say, &quot;Let the youngsters learn their lesson.&quot; My party
    therefore carried the day and various Masters were appointed to undertake different
    adventures. Mohammed, Luther, Adam Weishaupt, the man we knew as Christian Rosencreutz,
    and many servants of science, were thus chosen. Some of these movements have succeeded
    more or less; some have failed entirely. In my present incarnation I have met several such
    Masters, who, having failed, are now building up again their shattered forces. My own task
    was to bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form. I was
    involved in the catastrophe which overtook the order of the Temple, and as Alexander the
    Sixth, failed in my task of crowning the Renaissance, through not being wholly purified in
    my personal character. (An appropriately trivial spiritual error may externalize as the
    most appalling crimes.)</p>
    <p>Before this Council, there is a long gap of complete amnesia. I merely remember that I
    was Ko Hsuen, a disciple of Lao Tzu, the author of the &quot;King Khang King&quot;, the
    classic of Purity; which, by the way, I translated into English verse during this
    Retirement. All I know is that somehow or other I made a &quot;great miss&quot;, forfeited
    my Mastership, and had to climb the ladder again from the bottom. It is the shame and
    agony of this which have prevented me from facing the memory --- so far.</p>
    <p>Almost every day I found myself in some new trance, each of course perfect in its own
    way, and each of a depth and sublimity which makes description impossible to attempt; yet
    all the time it seemed to me that each trance was no more than the letter of a word, as if
    some truth were being revealed which could only be expressed piecemeal. The crown of these
    trances was an angelic vision such as I had never before enjoyed. The communication was
    perfect on all planes of being; and this completeness conferred a sense of reality
    altogether beyond previous experience. It was the difference between meeting a friend face
    to face, and trying to reconstruct his personality from letters, photographs, gramophone
    records, memories and cherished flowers.</p>
    <p>It may be that this vision was granted me in order to fortify me for the climax of my
    Retirement. On September 5th, my record contains the following entry. </p>
    <p>I feel that I am more likely to be able to convey some hint of the colossal character
    of this revelation if I simply quote the broken staggering words in which I wrote it down
    at the time. As will be seen, I did not dare to write what it actually was, but I remember
    at this moment how I had to invoke</p>
    <p>{839}</p>
    <p>the deep-seated habit of years to get courage to drag myself to my diary. I felt like a
    soldier wounded to death, scrawling in his own blood the horrifyingly disastrous
    information which he has lost his life in seeking.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>5:00 p.m. The meditation of this afternoon resulted in an initiation so stupendous that
      I dare not hint at its Word. It is the supreme secret of a Magus, and its is so awful that
      I tremble even now --- two hours later and more --- 2:20 p.m. was the time --- as I write
      concerning it. In a single instant I had the Key to the whole of the Chinese wisdom. In
      the light --- momentary glimpse as it was --- of this truth, all systems of religion and
      philosophy became absolutely puerile. Even the Law appears no more than a curious
      incident. I remain absolutely bewildered, blinded, knowing what blasting image lies in
      this shrine. It baffles me to understand how my brother Magi, knowing this, ever went on.</p>
      <p>I had only one foreshadowing of this Vision of Jupiter --- for so I may call it! ---
      and that was a Samadhi which momentarily interrupted my concentration of Sammasati. This
      can only be described vaguely by saying that I obtained a reconciliation of two contraries
      of which &quot;There is a discrimination between good and evil&quot; is one.</p>
      <p>This experience has shaken me utterly; it has been a terrible struggle to force myself
      to this record. The secret comes along the Path of Aleph to Chokmah. I could write it
      plainly in a few words of one syllable, and most people would not even notice it.<strong>1</strong>
      But it has might to hurl every Master of the Temple into the Abyss, and to fling every
      adept of the Rose Cross down to the Qliphoth. No wonder One said that the <em>Book T</em>
      was in ashes in the Urn of a Magus! I can't see at all how it will affect me at present.
      Even the Way of the Tao looks idiotic --- but then of course that's what it is! So I
      suppose that's it, all right. And its freedom, in an utterly fascinating and appalling
      sense, is beyond my fiercest conception.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>An experience of this intensity demands a period of repose, no less than a boat race or
    any other form of intense effort. The adepts have always insisted on due preparation for
    any initiation. As <em>The Book of the Law</em> says, &quot;... Wisdom says: be strong!
    Then canst thou bear more joy. ...&quot; I accordingly broke up my camp after a few days'
    holiday from magical work, and returned to New York.</p>
    <p>The next period is strangely confused. It was as if I were left in the Desert with no
    idea of direction and surrounded by a series of mirages. Innumerable people came into my
    life and passed out again, without leaving any trace.</p>
    <p>{840}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">I find that I wrote it down plainly seventeen years ago! But I had no
        conception of its terror --- one must be a Magus to get that!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The fact was that none of the people appointed by Amalantrah to various tasks were
    willing to undertake them. It may well be that this was due to a lack of real faith on my
    part. The communications from the Wizard had become confused and even contradictory. I had
    failed to understand his plan and to acquiesce unreservedly in it. This weakness of mine
    naturally reacted on the other people concerned.</p>
    <p>Only one clear duty lay before me. The five years of silence which were to follow the
    publication of number 10</a> of <em>The Equinox</em></a> were at an end. I therefore
    devoted myself to planning another ten numbers, beginning at the spring equinox of 1919. I
    had an immense amount of material ready for publication. The one critical omission was the
    comment on <em>The Book of the Law</em>, which I had constantly shirked re-writing. I
    pulled myself together and went down to Atlantic City for the purpose of getting this
    done. My idea was to write it inspirationally; which is correct. The only drawback was
    that the inspiration was forced and feeble. I know now that the writing of this Comment
    must be a definite miracle, parallel with that of the production of the Book itself.</p>
    <p>I stumbled on through the Desert somehow. Even today I hardly understand the object of
    the ordeals of this journey. At the beginning of the next Chokmah day I found myself on
    the edge of the oasis which I was to make my home. I had identified myself with the god of
    my Grade of Magus, Tahuti, the Lord of the Word, and I was invested accordingly with the
    attributes proper to him. The last of the officers in my initiation was the Ape of Thoth.
    This creature translates into action his thought or, in other words, is the instrument
    through which his idea assumes sensible form. This Ape became my permanent companion. At
    this moment, she is beside me in a bathing house at Marsa Plage near Tunis, writing these
    words.</p>
    <p>Tahuti being the Lord of Speech, I published number 1 of volume III</a> of <em>The Equinox</em> on March
    21st, 1919. I arranged for it to contain something like a complete programme of my
    proposed Operation to initiate, emancipate and relieve mankind.</p>
    <p>The first item is a &quot;Hymn to Pan&quot;, which I believe to be the most powerful
    enchantment ever written. Next, after explaining the general idea of my work, I issued a
    curriculum, classifying the books whose study should give a complete intellectual
    knowledge of all subjects which bear on the Great Work.</p>
    <p>The book of <em>The Sandal</em></a> presents a lyrical
    interpretation of the Law of Thelema. This is followed by the first installment of
    &quot;The Magical Record of my Son&quot;, Frater O.I.V.V.I.O., to show how in actual
    practice a fairly normal man came to attain to be a Master of the Temple. Every pertinent
    detail of his career from the start is clearly set forth.</p>
    <p>The latter half of the volume is devoted to explaining the principles of</p>
    <p>{841}</p>
    <p>the O.T.O. showing how men and women may work in groups publicly, and giving outlines
    of a social system free from the disastrous defects of our present civilization. I
    republished the Ritual of the Gnostic Mass in this section. The supplement consists of
    Blavatsky's <em>Voice in the Silence</em> with a very full commentary. My purpose was to
    bring back Theosophists to the true principles of their founder; principles which have
    been shamefully abandoned by her successors --- to the utter ruin of the society, either
    as a nursery for adepts or as a civilizing influence in barbaric Christiandom.</p>
    <p>During this winter, I was approached by a powerful body of high grade freemasons in
    Detroit. They knew only too well that their Order was at the best tomfoolery; and, for the
    rest, anything all the way down to fraud and blackmail. They desired the light which they
    knew me to possess. I offered to reorganize freemasonry, to replace the pomposities and
    banalities of their ragbag of rituals by a simple, lucid and coherent system.</p>
    <p>I soon saw that any effort would be a waste of time. Even their compact group was torn
    by bitter jealousies. Their leader, for all his fine talk, had only one real desire --- to
    communicate with his dead wife, a silly smirking society waxwork, a pink-tea princess!
    Their second string was a doctor, who spent sleepless nights sweating with shame and
    sentimentality in an agony of anxiety as to whether it was his duty to get divorced in
    order to marry a white-haired spinster, half-crazy with the pain of cancer, with whom he
    had no sexual relation at all, but an overwhelming obsession that she was his sister-soul,
    his mystic mate, his psychic partner and his Ouija Wife. A third, illiterate and bigoted,
    was a mere spat of ignorant argument that the signs of the zodiac had somehow got mixed
    up, apparently owing to some confusion about the precedence of the twelve apostles! The
    only member of the group who had even a smattering of education, as we understand it in
    Europe, was more than half insane on the subject of sex. He had got it into his head that
    a secret method of managing such matters existed, the possessor of which could perform all
    sorts of miracles, from curing consumption to making a million dollars. He spent his life
    hunting for books on sexual Magick; and, knowing that I was in possession of the secret he
    sought, spent a whole night shivering in the corridor with his ear to the keyhole of my
    bedroom, in the hope of hearing something that would give him a hint. He even tried to use
    his own mistress to spy on me: when she came from my room, he started to browbeat and
    bully her into giving the minutest details of her adventure!</p>
    <p>The best of the crowd was a young doctor who had sufficient sense to see how stupid the
    rest were, to disdain the bluff of the advertising adepts, and to realize that genuine
    magicians were necessarily gentlemen and scholars. He felt himself utterly lost in the
    darkness of Detroit, but despaired of mending the matter by setting forth to seek the
    Graal without guidance. He was</p>
    <p>{842}</p>
    <p>so fixed in doubt and distrust that even the truth, soiled by his suspicion, could not
    quell the whispers of the demons of denial. They persistently persuaded his shaking soul
    that the weeds of falsehood grew so rank that never a seed of truth might find a space to
    shoot. Thus, doubting the whole world, he had learnt to doubt himself. His will was sodden
    with scepticism. He could never make up his mind to do anything definite. The man had many
    great qualities, but the dollar-snatching charlatans that pullulate in America had driven
    him to drift and potter. He did not even understand that he might have saved his soul by
    devoting himself to the shallowest quack in Chicago, daring death and damnation for the
    hollowest humbug that ever wrote himself Rosicrucian without knowing how to spell it.
    Pluck would have pulled him through in the long run; as Blake said, &quot;if the fool
    would persist in his folly he would become wise.&quot;</p>
    <p>It did not take me long to see that the real object of this gang was to exploit me.
    They wanted something for nothing; instead I was the only man to profit --- I gained the
    knowledge of the astonishing variety of dirty tricks that men could play under the mask of
    friendship and respect.</p>
    <p>But I was immune to the virus. I possessed not only something, but everything, and was
    only too eager to give it for nothing. I naturally became an object of the deepest
    suspicion. Unable to comprehend honour, unselfishness and generosity, my frank loyalty and
    royal largesse baffled their brains. They felt sure that it concealed some super-subtle
    scheme for swindling them or getting them into my power. They thought they knew that the
    more noble an action appeared, the deeper the deceit and the dirtier the design beneath
    it. I adhered to simple straightforward sense. I told the truth without a thought of what
    might happen in consequence. It was inconceivable to them that I, knowing so much, should
    yet be innocent. They knew me poor. It was strange indeed that I never tried to make
    money, or even accepted it when offered! The result of all this was that I, doing my
    utmost to enlighten them, deepened their darkness. I simplified and emphasized the truth;
    they merely floundered further into falsehood.</p>
    <p>I tried my hardest to manifest myself, to explain my point of view, my mental methods,
    my morals, manners, motives and magical objectives. I merely became the more mysterious.
    They could never guess how I would act in any circumstances. My purpose being single, it
    was incomprehensible to their complex confusion of cravings. My &quot;yes&quot; appalled
    them --- it was such a sinister way of saying &quot;no&quot;; and when I said
    &quot;no&quot; they sweated and swooned with fear of what I might mean by so satanic a way
    of saying &quot;yes&quot;. I kept on smiling; I became silent; they saw me as the Sphinx.
    They began to quarrel among themselves; scandal, divorce suits, bankruptcies and every
    sort of nastiness followed. My &quot;son&quot;, who had lived in Detroit for some months
    trying to teach them the elements of sense and decency, left them to</p>
    <p>{843}</p>
    <p>stew in the stinking soup they had cooked, and went off to Chicago. Both he and I
    learnt a priceless lesson in our dealings with these demoniacs. We have that to thank for
    the steady, quiet, natural success of his campaign in Chicago.</p>
    <p>One cannot deal with Americans on the principles which seem inevitable in Europe. One
    often sees a placard in offices, &quot;come in without knocking. Go out the same
    way.&quot; They would rather not hear unpleasant truths. What! Shoot a sleeping sentinel?
    Nope; rush the chloroform in case he wakes! They have learnt the psychological fact that
    confidence is a real asset. A man works best when he feels he is sure to succeed. A fear
    of failure palsies every faculty. The vogue of Christian Science, and countless cults for
    drawing in dollars by wishing one had them, persuading oneself that somehow or other they
    will arrive, scorning every success, forgetting every failure, shutting one's eyes to
    unpleasant facts, and interpreting every bit of good luck as a triumph beyond the power of
    trumpets to tell --- a token of the intense interest taken by the Almighty in His
    favourite child --- this course of conduct, though its more reasonable practitioners are
    ready to admit that it is rant and rubbish, is pursued as part of a calculated policy.
    They are ready to fool themselves in order to take advantage of the stimulating effect of
    optimism.</p>
    <p>The other side of the medal is this: when any man points to any fact that shakes this
    opium serenity, checks this cocaine self-assurance, that man takes a chance of a free ride
    out of town on a rail. The spirit of criticism is detested and dreaded. It is easy to
    understand why this is. The States have been won from the wilderness by a system which
    demanded courage and clear sight from the pioneers; but once the trail was blazed, the
    rest of the work was done on a basis of credit which a European banker would consider
    utterly reckless gambling. Everyone, from the farmer and merchant to the manufacturer and
    financier, entered into a tacit agreement to bet that any given enterprise would succeed.
    As the natural resources were there, while luck decreed that the commonwealth should not
    have to face any overwhelming obstacle, the gamblers have won. It is obvious that any man
    in an outpost besieged by nature (such as is every new settlement outside New England, the
    Atlantic coast and the old settlements in the south) was really a traitor if he said,
    however truthfully, anything which might daunt the spirit of his comrades. Those men won
    out through sheer ignorance of the chances against them, stolid stupidity which blinded
    them to their desperate plight and bestial insensibility to the actual hardships which
    they had to endure. It was criminal to insist on the existence of evils for which there
    was no remedy.</p>
    <p>This spirit has persisted, though its utility is past. It has become a fixed feature of
    the religion of the country. It was the deadliest delusion that I had to meet. Spiritual
    attainment, magical; development, any line of work</p>
    <p>{844}</p>
    <p>soever whose material is subtler than the sensible world, demands (as the first
    condition of success) the most severe spirit of scepticism, the most scientific system of
    research. For immediately one becomes aware of impressions and ideas which are not subject
    to the criticism of sensory perception, they are inevitably influenced by the individual
    characteristics of the observer and the distortion is difficult to detect because, until
    one is very advanced indeed, one is not aware of the aberration caused by the error of the
    instrument. Even in the world of sense, similar troubles occur. To a man who is
    colour-blind, the red light is &quot;really&quot; green --- beyond his power to make any
    correction, because the source of his error is in the instrument of sight itself. He might
    well say, &quot;But if, as you tell me, this green lamp is red, how do I know that it is a
    lamp, not a tiger? I have only my eyes to depend on.&quot;</p>
    <p>I found it impossible to persuade even the most intelligent people who came to me to
    take the first step --- that of clearing the ground of their minds of every preconceived
    idea. They yearned for me to fill them up to the neck with any ridiculous rubbish that
    flattered their vanity, fed their folly, doped their dread of death and damnation, and
    inflated their idle fancies, intoxicated their inane ideals. I simply hammered away with
    cold common sense. I drenched them with douches of doubt. I pricked their bladders of
    bluff; I tapped their dropsical sentimentality and applied a clyster of candour to the
    constipation of their respectability. By this simple expedient I drove them all away. I
    made myself enemies everywhere. The crowd of charlatans were particularly annoyed. They
    were eager to hail me as their master and even to give me the lion's share of the swag. It
    hurt them horribly when they found I would not play the game, or even take the trouble to
    hail them to my barn door. Every people has the prophets it deserves; the credulous
    cowardly ice-cream-soda idealist is best left with the illiterate illuminati, rascally
    Rosicrucians, magpie mediums, parrot psychics, and cockroach clairvoyants with whom they
    feel at home. One cannot initiate imbeciles.</p>
    <p>My adventures in Detroit came as the climax which confirmed the conclusions I had
    already formed from casual conversations and correspondence with a fairly large and varied
    selection of would-be disciples. Only in rare individuals could I detect a trace of
    genuine aspiration, of the ambition to attain, either for their own sake or for that of
    others, in any allowable sense. They wanted more social success. Nobody seemed to have the
    faintest idea of what is really meant by knowledge and power. Some seemed anxious to help
    the progress of humanity; but here again, the wish was partly a puff-ball of pride, partly
    a maudlin sentiment such as one finds in servants' hall novelettes.</p>
    <p>The ignorance of all, without exception, was simply without limit. It</p>
    <p>{845}</p>
    <p>was rare to find a man who knew so much as the names of the most famous classics. Their
    ignorance was not even accessible to instruction. It was armourplated, and adorned with a
    bigoted belief in the most blatant balderdash. I met the heads of four flourishing cults
    who claimed to be Rosicrucians. Not one of them had so much as heard of <em>The Fama
    Fraternitatis</em> or <em>The Chymical Marriage</em>. The most famous astrologer in the
    States, who makes fifty thousand dollars a year, did not know that the solar system was
    essentially a disk. She thought the planets were stuck at random in the sky like so many
    plums in a suet pudding. In thirty years of daily use of the Ephemeris, she had never
    observed that Neptune takes fifteen years or so to pass through a sign of the zodiac, and
    told her clients that Neptune being in such and such a sign at their birth, they must
    possess various curious powers. When I pointed out that this applied to everyone born in
    three lustres, she was at first bewildered, then incredulous; and, proof being produced,
    angry and insulting.</p>
    <p>These were the highest class of merchants of Magick. The majority of writers on the
    subject bleat on from blunder to blunder. I met no single man in the United States in five
    years who had any idea what Yoga actually is, much less of the metaphysical theories on
    which it is based. Its objects and methods were either understood so vaguely as to be a
    mere variation on Sunday School sob stuff, or distorted by dreams of the dollar or the
    dread of disease; their information being based on some book purporting to be the secret
    instruction of a particularly prominent yogi, but in fact the illiterate rubbish of an
    unsuccessful horse doctor from Idaho who could hardly find India on the map --- even if
    you offered him a dollar to do it.</p>
    <p>This illiterature is distributed indiscriminately; a vast venomous vomit! There being
    no background of education, no standard of criticism, the reader has no means of
    distinguishing between the best and the worst. He has no means of forming a groundwork on
    which his mind might build. It is impossible for the European to understand the
    helplessness of these people. We have definite principles in our minds by which,
    consciously or unconsciously, we judge with fair correctness of things which may be in a
    sense entirely strange to us.</p>
    <p>For instance, suppose that I am unable to read a single word of Russian. I am
    nevertheless able to get a fair general idea of the probable character of the contents of
    any book by applying what I may call Sherlock Holmes methods. Obviously, I might be
    deceived. Gogol's masterpiece might be badly printed on rotten paper and defaced with vile
    illustrations in order to fool me. A series of such traps would teach me to distrust my
    judgment.</p>
    <p>Now, this is just the position in which the American finds himself. He has been sold so
    many pups that he flinches when he hears &quot;the watchdog's honest bark&quot;. He has
    been told, till his ears are nigh bursting, every sort of</p>
    <p>{846}</p>
    <p>falsehood, even a truth being exaggerated until its original nature hardly matters, on
    every conceivable subject.</p>
    <p>From earliest infancy, every American citizen is trained in &quot;make-believe&quot;.
    That is why <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> is the one masterpiece of character drawing that
    America has produced. The American is at heart acutely ashamed of his defects. His ideal
    of perfection is intensely dear to him, and I am the last person to blame him for refusing
    to admit that its attainment is impossible. But his nerves are constantly raw from
    realizing in his inmost heart that he is, after all, lacking in all sorts of ways.</p>
    <p>In one way or another practically every American is devoured by this demon of
    discontent, which is by no means the species which we call divine. The yearning of the
    poet to surpass all other singers, his rage at the resistance of the language to his
    rapture, have their root in his absolute trust in and worship of himself.</p>
    <p>I cried, Like Elijah: This is no country for the poet Aleister Crowley, or the adept,
    To Mega Therion, whose hope to help his fellow men has this one anchor: Truth shall make
    you free!</p>
