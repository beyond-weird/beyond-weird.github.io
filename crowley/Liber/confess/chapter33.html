    <p>While at Akyab I wrote <em>Ahab</em>, which, with a few other poems, was published as a
    companion to <em>Jezbel</em>. I had also, at odd times, continued <em>Orpheus</em> and <em>The
    Argonauts</em>. The latter play is really five separate plays of the Greek pattern. The
    effect of my journey is very manifest. I had entirely neglected the obvious astronomical
    symbolism of the Golden Fleece, and had introduced a number of Hindu ideas, both about
    Magick and about philosophy. To illustrate the voyage, I included lyrics descriptive of
    actual observations of Vera Cruz, Waikiki Beach, Hong Kong and other places which had
    excited me.</p>
    <p>The best thing in Book III of <em>Orpheus</em>, which occupied this period, is,
    perhaps, the invocation to Hecate, which I recited at Akyab with full magical intention.
    The goddess appeared in the form of Bhavani. The fact made more concrete my perception of
    the essential identity of all religions. Sinai and Olympus, Mount Kailasha and Mount Meru
    differed from each other as do the Dent Blanche, Mote Silvio and the Steinbockhorn. It is
    the same mountain seen from different sides and named by different people. It encouraged
    me to continue my studies in the Cabbala, which claims to reduce all possible ideas to
    combinations of comparatively few originals, the ten numbers, in fact; these ten numbers
    themselves being of course interrelated.</p>
    <p>From the beginning I had wanted to use my poetical gift to write magical invocations.
    Hymns to various gods and goddesses may be found scattered through my works; but in Book
    III of <em>Orpheus</em>, Persephone is invoked directly by commemorating her adventures. I
    developed this much further in Book IV of <em>Orpheus</em>. The idea was put into my mind
    by Euripides, whose <em>Bacchae</em> I had been reading at odd times, having picked up a
    copy at a second-hand book store in San Francisco. When I had first read it, for academic
    purposes, I had entirely failed to realize that the play was an invocation of Dionysus. I
    now began to see that by commemorating the story of the god one might identify oneself
    with him, and thus constitute a subtler, stronger and more complete invocation of him that
    by any direct address. I might even go so far as to say that the form of the latter
    implies the consciousness of duality and therefore tends to inhibit identification.</p>
    <p>My predilection is due to the fact that I am primarily a lyric poet. My deepest natural
    tendency is to exalt my soul by what I may call straightforward intoxication. Thus Shelly
    and Swinburne come more natural to</p>
    <p>{273}</p>
    <p>me than Aeschylus and Shakespeare, who intoxicate the reader by transporting him to
    their wonderland.</p>
    <p>Sunday the twenty-third I went aboard S.S. <em>Kapurthala</em> to return to Calcutta.
    The next day we anchored outside Chittagong, a most uninteresting place. I was to lazy to
    land. Two days later I got back to Calcutta. Getting my mail, I busied myself in preparing
    for the great journey. It was now definitely settled that our expedition should meet at
    Rawalpindi. I only took one day off, when I went to Sodpur snipe shooting with a friend of
    Thornton's, with whom I was now staying, Lambe having gone off to Australia.</p>
    <p>I have inserted the record of this short excursion somewhat at length. Most of it is
    taken from an account written up when it was still fresh in my mind. It should give an
    idea of the daily detail of such journeys and enable the reader to clothe with flesh the
    skeleton of my subsequent wanderings.</p>
    <p>On the seventh of March I left for Benares and saw the usual sights --- temples, yogis
    and dancing girls. I had become very cynical and blas&#130; about all these things, which
    only a few months before would have roused me to ecstasies of wonder. But I now made a wry
    mouth at the sour sub-flavour of everything. My conversation with Allan about Buddhism,
    and my own meditations, had disenchanted me. Everything was recognized automatically as
    illusion, calculated to fetter the soul if one allowed it to fool one.</p>
    <p>On the twelfth I reached Agra. My entry about the Taj Mahal is interesting.</p>
    <p>Saw Taj. A dream of beauty, with appallingly evil things dwelling therein. I actually
    had to use. H.P.K. formula! (This means that I assumed the god-form of Harpocrates to
    prevent the invasion of my aura by objectionable ideas.) The building soon palls, the evil
    aura is apparent and disgust succeeds. But the central hall is like a magic circle, of
    strained aura, like after the banishing.</p>
    <p>The aesthetic criticism needs revision. I do not think the building beautiful; the
    conception is too exquisite for the scale of the execution. The is that of an etching
    twenty feet by thirty.</p>
    <p>This reminds me of a puzzle that perplexed me many years later in Washington, D.C. I
    could not understand why the obelisk was so atrociously ugly. &quot;How can even the
    Americans,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;go wrong over so absolutely simple a form?&quot;
    I asked the sculptor, Paul Bartlett, who cleared up the difficulty, simply and shortly:
    &quot;An obelisk is a monolith.&quot;</p>
    <p>It is one of the fundamental qualities of men who understand a subject perfectly to be
    able to sweep away the most elaborate illusions by appeal to bedrock fact. I remember how
    Frank Harris once enlightened me about imitation pearls. One knows how cleverly the
    manufacturers of these things present their case so as to deceive the very elect. But
    Frank Harris said: &quot;A</p>
    <p>{274}</p>
    <p>pearl is a stone.&quot; And the whole fantastic fabric of falsehood crumbled at the
    touch!</p>
    <p>I cannot omit to mention one atrocity at Agra. Some prurient English curator had
    indulged his foul instincts by whitewashing a magnificent fresco in the palace because it
    was &quot;improper&quot;. In other words, he was so leprously lascivious that anything
    which reminded him of reproduction produced a frenzied spasm of sensuality in his soul.
    However, his vandalism still cried out against him. The beautiful wall which he had made
    as blank as his intelligence still reminded him of his rottenness. He had no resource but
    to whitewash all the other walls, in order to secure artistic uniformity!</p>
    <p>After all, it is perhaps the best thing to do; having bowdlerized Shakespeare and
    edited the Bible so as to remove all reference to any kind of sin, it is hardly worth
    while to preserve the remains. There are only two courses open to logic; one can either
    accept the universe as it is, face every fact frankly and fearlessly, and make one's soul
    immune to the influence of any invasion; or abolish the whole thing by administering
    soporifics to the spirit. After all, the virtues which are dearest to degenerate Europeans
    imply the existence of those very things which they are most concerned to deny. The pious
    pretence that evil does not exist only makes it vague, enormous and menacing. Its
    overshadowing formlessness obsesses the mind. The way to beat an enemy is to define him
    clearly, to analyse and measure him. Once an idea is intelligently grasped, it ceases to
    threaten the mind with the terrors of the unknown.</p>
    <p>I went to Delhi on the sixteenth. The best thing here is the Turkish bath, where the
    process of purification is completed by charming ladies. On the eighteenth I wrote about <em>Orpheus</em>,
    &quot;The accursed Book III utterly finished. Oh <em>Book IV</em>! On the nineteenth I
    went and saw the fort with &quot;Major Graham, a prize fool from South Africa&quot;. The
    entry demands emendation. He wasn't a major; his name wasn't Graham; he had never been to
    South Africa; and he was anything but a fool! His idea was to represent himself as in
    charge of some Boer prisoners and obtain credit and cash by various misrepresentations.</p>
    <p>The twentieth and twenty-first were great days in my life. I wrote an essay which I
    originally gate the title &quot;Crowleymas Day&quot; and published under the title &quot;Berashith</a>&quot;
    in Paris by itself, incorporating it subsequently in <em>The Sword of Song</em>. The
    general idea is to eliminate the idea of infinity from our conception of the cosmos. It
    also shows the essential identity of Manichaeism (Christianity), Vedantism and Buddhism.
    Instead of explaining the universe as modifications of a unity, which itself needs
    explaining, I regard it as NOTHING, conceived as (illusory) pairs of contradictories. What
    we call a thought does not really exist at all by itself. It is merely half of nothing. I
    know that there are practical difficulties in accepting this,</p>
    <p>{275}</p>
    <p>though it gets rid so nicely of a priori obstacles. However, the essay is packed with
    ideas, nearly all of which have proved extremely fertile, and it represents fairly enough
    the criticism of my genius upon the varied ideas which I had gathered since I first came
    to Asia.</p>
    <p>During the whole time, I had been studying the original scriptures of Hinduism and
    Buddhism very thoroughly. Besides this, I had discussed every aspect of religion and
    philosophy with immensely varied types of thinkers. From men of such spiritual and
    scholarly attainment as Allan Bennett, the Hon. P. Ramanathan, Prince Jinawaravansa,
    Paramaguru Swami, Shri Swami Swayam Prakashanand Maithala, to such excremental exponents
    of error as theosoÿhists, missionaries and even members of the Salvation Army. Gathering
    all these shreds together, I had preferred to call the pattern Buddhism. The scientific
    agnosticism, rational psychology, and freedom from superstitious or emotional appeals,
    decided me in its favour. There were, of course, two vast gaps in my line. I knew little
    and understood less of Chinese thought, and was almost equally ignorant of Islam with its
    Sufi superstructure.</p>
    <p>It was dramatically fit that I should have devoted these two days to this essay; for on
    the second I received a wire from Eckenstein. I had a day to spare before proceeding to
    Rawalpindi, which I spent at Oakley shooting magar. Here is the story:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Maiden, the proÿrietor of the hotel, came with me and provided a most admirable
      tiffin. I lent him my Mauser and relied myself upon the `577. After getting permission
      from the engineer in charge of the canal works, we put off in a small boat and rowed up
      the stream. Very soon we saw a fine big crocodile on the banks; but as they are very
      suspicious beasts an slide into the water at anyone's approach, we determined to try a
      long shot. I crawled into the bow of the boat, and while the natives held the boat steady,
      loosed off at about a hundred and thirty yards. The shot was either a very good one or a
      very lucky one, for the magar was certainly mortally wounded by it. We rowed rapidly up to
      the beast to find him lashing about in a couple of feet of water and bleeding profusely. I
      had almost certainly shot him through the heart. Unfortunately, this is of very little use
      with these reptiles. We got up as close as the natives could be persuaded to go. There
      certainly was some risk if we had gone quite close in, but we ought to have ventured near
      enough to drive a boat-hook into the mud between him and the deep water. But they could
      not be persuaded to do this and there was no time for argument. Maiden sat up in the
      middle of the boat and fired about fifteen Mauser cartridges into the struggling
      crocodile, which I think was a proceeding of doubtful utility. He</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{276}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>persuaded me, however, to fire a couple more cartridges myself, which I did, right down
      the beast's throat. The second shot, however, very nearly led to a catastrophe, as the
      boat was not at all steady and the recoil of the heavy express sent me an awful cropper
      backwards on to the gunwale of the boat. Luckily no harm came of it. I was now more
      anxious than ever to get hold of the beast or to pin him with the boathook, thought his
      struggles were gradually ceasing, but nothing we could do was any good; little by little
      he slid off the shallow into the deep water and sank. After hunting about for twenty
      minutes we gave the affair up as a bad job.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Rowing slowly up the stream, we soon caught sight of another fine beast, though not
      quite so big as the one we lost. I took, however, an extraordinarily careful shot at it
      and had the good luck to smash its spine. Everyone thought I had missed, but I swore that
      was impossible. Certainly the beast did not move as we rowed towards it. I sent the
      natives on to the bank, and after an infinite display of funk they ventured to catch hold
      of its tail; of course it had been shot stone dead. We got the body on board and rowed
      back to tiffin.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On Sunday, March 23rd, I took the mail for Pindi. As luck would have it, the car
    reserved for the expedition was on the train. So I jumped in and was introduced to my four
    new comrades.</p>
    <p>The Chogo Ri expedition had begun.</p>
