    <p>It is one of the regular jokes in India that people on the strength of the season in
    Calcutta write a book about the peninsula, but even the tourist of genius, like Charles
    Dickens, is far more presumptuous when he tackles the United States. India indeed is huge
    and varied beyond hope of human comprehension, but America, though its population is only
    a third of that of Hindustan, is composed of elements infinitely more varied, besides
    which India does at least stand still and allow one to look at it, whereas the United
    States undergoes a revolutionary change continually. I passed through the country in 1900.
    In 1906 I found it unrecognizable. My third visit in 1914 gave me another surprise, and
    during the following five years when I was actually resident the panorama shifted with
    kaleidoscopic swiftness.</p>
    <p>I have now learnt enough to realize that any attempt at description must inevitably be
    futile and that any opinion cannot but be presumptuous and misleading. Yet the subject is
    by far the most important in every respect which I have ever had to consider and I cannot
    possibly offer my autohagiography to the impatient public without doing my best to set
    down what I think.</p>
    <p>Intellectual generalizations must be discarded as insulting to my own intelligence as
    much as to the reader's. There is only one possible procedure; to state boldly a number of
    striking facts which came under my direct observation, leaving their significance and
    importance to fight for their own ends, but also to call upon the only testimony of
    equally assured liability, my spiritual intuition.</p>
    <p>I admit frankly that the whole of my intellectual opinion and practically all my
    personal prejudice combine to condemn the United States wholesale with absolute contempt
    and loathing and this attitude will undoubtedly manifest itself whenever the subject crops
    up in the course of these reminiscences, for my normal conscious self is generally
    speaking as the writer of these pages. Against this my subconscious intuition, whose
    judgment is to be trusted absolutely, is altogether opposed. I propose therefore to set
    forth first of all that which the Holy Spirit within me moves to utter, and afterwards to
    record the observed facts which influence my human consciousness to be so antagonistic to
    almost every feature of life and thought as I found it.</p>
    <p>I definitely appeal to my American readers to stand apart from their natural
    gratification at the first and their natural indignation at the second of these sections
    of my work, and to understand that my spiritual apprehension</p>
    <p>{725}</p>
    <p>of truth represents my real self, while my intellectual perceptions are necessarily
    coloured by my nationality, caste, education and personal predilection. I am not trying to
    shirk the responsibility for the harsh judgments which I promulgate. I should prefer to
    keep silent. I speak only in the hope that Americans may learn how shocking much of their
    morals and manners is to the educated European, and I insist upon the intensity of my
    utmost love for them and faith in their future, so that they may discriminate between my
    criticisms and those of such people as Mrs Asquith who are unable to go deeper than the
    facts and cherish an unalloyed animosity.</p>
    <p>Let me then begin by an analysis of my inmost spiritual sympathy for the people of the
    United States. First of all, let me explain about Europe. The war of 1914, and its sequel
    of revolution and economic catastrophe, is in my eyes the culmination of its many
    centuries of corruption by Christianity. The initial lesion was due to the decay of the
    Roman republican virtue. The immediate effect of the rise of Christianity was the break-up
    of social order, the suppression of philosophy and scholarship by fanaticism and the
    gradual engulfment of enlightenment in the Dark Ages. A partial resurrection was brought
    about by the Renaissance and from that moment began the long struggle between science and
    freedom on the one hand and dogmatism and tyranny on the other. During the ninteenth
    century, the triumph of the former seemed assured and almost complete. The forces of
    obscurantism and reaction were driven into dark corners but their natural cunning
    developed by centuries of experience inspired them to a final effort to regain their lost
    prestige and power. They adopted a new policy. They ceased to oppose openly the advance of
    science and the associated ethical and political principles which science indicated. They
    clipped the claws of the Lion of Enlightenment by establishing an unspoken convention to
    the effect that it was bad form to insist upon applying the new ideas to practical
    politics. The Church of England was to retain its official status in spite of its
    spiritual death. Dissent and agnosticism ought to be tolerated indeed but ignored. The
    system of social snobbery was to continue concurrently with the boast of the triumph of
    democratic principles. In every subject which might give rise to controversy there was a
    tacit agreement not to tell the truth. The people who persecuted Byron, Shelley, Darwin,
    Bradlaugh and Foote smiled amiably at the much more outspoken blasphemies of Bernard Shaw.
    The hollowness of Christianity and feudalism became shameless. No one dared to defend his
    convictions, if indeed he possessed them. There was a universal conspiracy to shirk facing
    the facts of life, with the result that the most complete moral darkness shrouded the
    causes and conduct of the war. We maintain our stupid shame with desperate determinations.
    A sham peace succeeded the sham war and the only realities were the revolutions which
    reduced civilization to chaos. Such reactions as that of Fascismo are manifestly
    phantasmagoric</p>
    <p>{726}</p>
    <p>and I cannot but conclude that at least for a long period anarchy will triumph in
    Europe. I turn therefore to America from an expiring solar system to a nebulous mass which
    I expect to develop into an organized galaxy.</p>
    <p>The elements of the United States are heterogeneous in a manner unprecedented in
    history. Every race, language and creed of Europe is represented. There is, moreover, an
    established contingent of Africans, a new infiltration of Asiatics, of whom the Jews are a
    critically important factor in the social and economic problems of the day, while even the
    Far East, despite fanatical opposition, is seeking to obtain a foothold. That so many
    inimical elements should consent to even a semblance of fraternity indicates some common
    spiritual impulse sufficiently strong to dominate lesser prejudices. I find this unity in
    the aspiration to escape from the restrictions of crystallized conventions. Germans who
    resented military service, Jews who found the pressure of persecution and ostracism
    unendurable, Armenians obsessed by the fear of massacre, Italians to whom the pettiness,
    poverty and priestcraft of their country were paralysing, Irish insulted and injured by
    English oppression, all alike bring me to America as a paradise of elbow room, liberty and
    prosperity.</p>
    <p>One aspect of this aspiration has a more general bearing. All Americans are eager for
    power, in one form or another. They therefore pursue with passionate ardour every path
    which promises knowledge as well as those which lead directly to mastery of environment.
    So powerful and so irrepressible is this enthusiasm that the most grotesque
    disillusionments fail to disgust them and no charlatanism so crude, no pretence so
    puerile, no humbug so outrageous as to deter them from running after the next new
    religion. Their dauntless innocence persuades me that just as soon as they have acquired
    the critical faculty, they will progress spiritually more swiftly and sanely than has ever
    been known.</p>
    <p>At present two hindrances hamstring them. Firstly, the desperate death struggles of
    dogmatism, and secondly the practically universal ignorance of the elements of spiritual
    science. They insist on impossible ideals and hoax themselves about their holiness to an
    extreme that English hypocrisy at its zenith never approximates and their credulity is so
    crass that the followers of Joanna Southcott, the Agapemonites and the peculiar people
    seem by comparison philosophers and sages. Yet all this extravagance is but as the froth
    upon the crest of an irresistible breaker. Even the puritan cruelty, the social savagery,
    the extravagant racial ribaldry and the monomaniac stampede to acquire dollars testify
    more to the energy and enthusiasm of the people than to its casual concomitants of
    ignorance, delusion and fatuity which impress the ordinary observer. They are shrewd; none
    shrewder, lacking only the data to direct the shrewdness. They will soon discover how to
    distinguish</p>
    <p>{727}</p>
    <p>between genuine teachers and quacks, as also the fact that the power of money is
    limited and can buy no food either for spirit or soul. They will then pursue the path of
    evolution on sane and scientific lines eschewing unsound methods and unsatisfactory aims.</p>
    <p>My instinct has always assured me of this and stimulated my eagerness to educate and
    initiate everyone I met. I felt that fundamentally we were brothers, and I believe that
    this intense sympathy was just what deepened my disgust and darkened my despair at the
    impossibility of reaching them. Morally, socially, intellectually, the gulf was not to be
    bridged. There was no common ground of comprehension. When I insisted on scientific
    methods, I met with fear lest the foundations of their faiths should be shaken and every
    one of them come to some crazy creed, pompous, pretentious and puerile. When I tried to
    show them that conventional canons of conduct were children of circumstance, belief in
    whose absolute ethical value merely masked the face of truth and prevented them from
    perceiving nature, they were simply shocked. They had never inquired why any given virtue
    should be valid. The same of course applied to the question of creed. Even those who
    wandered from teacher to teacher were fanatically convinced that their momentary cult was
    perfect at every point. I could not persuade them that their admitted fickleness was
    evidence that their present creed reflected a mere mood.</p>
    <p>My real fear for America is that when it finds a few axioms on which a working majority
    can agree, a few dogmas to which it can rally, there will be an immediate effort to crush
    out all incompatible ideas, and even to atrophy its own possibilities of further
    development by extirpating any growth of genius within its own ranks, exactly as was done
    by Rome. In this event the tyranny would be infinitely worse than anything in the history
    of Christianity, for the worst of the moral defects of Americans is cold-blooded cruelty
    --- their struggle against nature and the corrupting influences of such vices as
    drunkenness and sexual immorality has let them to value the harder virtues at the expense
    of the more human.</p>
    <p>The latter indeed are regarded as vices even by those who cherish them in secret. Thus,
    in spite of the extraordinary diversity of creeds, cults, codes, fads and ideals, there
    lies the instinct to compel conformity. The whole history of the country has hammered into
    their heads the evident truth that unity is strength. Their very motto affirms it --- <em>E
    Pluribus Unum</em>. Their history itself bears witness to this. What was the Civil War but
    a murderous struggle against secession? Prussian methods were used to dragoon the pacifist
    majority into fighting Germany, and prohibition was put over by every unscrupulous trick
    against the will of the people. Today, we see the Ku Klux Klan attempting to impose, by
    secret society methods of anonymous menace backed by boycott, arson and assassination, the
    ideals of a clique; and nearly</p>
    <p>{728}</p>
    <p>as noxious are the arrogant aims and brutal tactics of Catholics and freemasons.</p>
    <p>In their own way capital and labour are influenced by the same idea, that of imposing a
    rigid and uniform rule on the entire community regardless of local conditions or any other
    considerations which might make for diversity. I need hardly point out that this principle
    is in flat contradiction with the Declaration of Independence in the constitution. I am
    afraid that the root of the evil lies in the psychological fact that men proclaim the
    principles of freedom only when they are suffering from oppression. No sooner do they
    become free and prosperous than they begin to perceive the duties of discipline.</p>
    <p>It is already shockingly manifest that the moral correspondences of this tendency are
    in operation. As Fabre D'Olivet points out in his examination of <em>The Golden Verses of
    Pythagoras</em>, initiation, that is progress, requires that at every point the candidate
    should be confronted with the free choice between actions dependent upon the three
    principal virtues, courage, temperance and prudence. The aim of American statecraft is on
    the contrary to atrophy these virtues by making them unnecessary, and indeed limiting full
    choice to unimportant matters. A third spiritual danger arises from the dogmatic idealism
    which determines social and economic conditions. So multiform is the prevailing error that
    the only course is to oppose to it the true doctrine as follows:</p>
    <p>The growth of a nation depends on its ability to draw the greatest nourishment from the
    greatest area of soil as against the pressure of rival plants. This depends, <em>certeris
    paribus</em>, on the numbers. Now numbers depend on the willingness and ability of women
    to make child-bearing and rearing the main business of life, and of the men to protect
    them and support them at their task. The surplus wealth may, nevertheless, be invested in
    another way, calculated to increase efficiency and potential; that is, in the support of a
    class which is not directly wealth producing as such, the class of the learned. This class
    must be abundantly supplied with leisure and the apparatus for research and freed from all
    anxiety or similar distractions. It should in fact be treated as a guild or spiritual
    fraternity. The existence of any other class which does not pull its own weight in the
    boat is evidence of plethora.</p>
    <p>The above principles are extremely simple and self-evident, but in America they have
    been pushed out of sight by doctrinal propositions based on <em>a priori</em>
    considerations of things as they ought to be in the mind of the dogmatist.</p>
    <p>I still hope that experience will eliminate these errors, and in that hope I address
    myself first of all to the American republic.</p>
    <p>Having thus affirmed the instinctive attitude to the American people, let me turn to
    the other extreme and record a number of observations which</p>
    <p>{729}</p>
    <p>seem specially significant, the deductions from which appear unmitigatingly damning,
    but the antinomy with my spiritual standpoint is to be overcome by interpreting these
    flagrant and atrocious faults as symptomatic only of infantile and adolescent aberration,
    with the exception of a very few individuals indeed, and those, almost invariably, either
    of pedigree stock or educated by experience of Europe.</p>
    <p>An adult American is a <em>rara avis</em>. The actual conditions which confront the
    developing intelligence are so incoherent and unintelligible that the unity of background
    which Europeans inherit and imagine to be the common property of mankind is absent.</p>
    <p>Let me illustrate my meaning. In Europe we take for granted such first principles as
    the limits of the possibility of development of any given type of energy. We assume, for
    instance, that the efficiency of the areoplane depends upon the ratio of power to weight
    in the first place, the increase of the former being limited by the theoretical potential
    of the sources of energy at our disposal. We also reflect that increase of size, power and
    velocity involves the overcoming of obstacles which become more formidable in geometrical
    progression. Again, at certain points in the advance, entirely new considerations begin to
    apply, such as the resistance of our material to the pressure of air, and the
    physiological potentiality of the airman. To us this nexus seems an integral element of
    necessity.</p>
    <p>The average American argues in complete ignorance of any such restriction. To him, to
    double the power is to double the pace and so on. His whole experience inflamed by his
    native enthusiasm reminds him that during the last century innumerable inventions, which
    the greatest authorities declared to be theoretically impossible, are now in daily use.</p>
    <p>Consider the discovery of radium; how it revealed the existence of a form of energy
    enormously greater in quality than anything previously known. More, we can now calculate
    that atomic energy --- could we only grasp it --- would stand to radium as radium to
    steam, or more so. He is therefore perfectly right in refusing to discredit, on common
    sense grounds,the report that a cannon has been constructed to carry a shell across the
    Atlantic, or a flying machine to go to the moon; an instrument capable of detecting any
    conceivable fact about a man from a drop of his blood; of penetrating the past or
    foretelling the future. There is, in fact, no theoretical limit to human attainment, for
    the simple reason that nature is known to contain all conceivable and inconceivable forms
    of energy and perceptive potentiality. Concentrated on this conviction, he constantly
    makes himself ridiculous, through ignorance of the details of the patient progress of
    science. Like other varieties of faith it lays its votaries open to the most fantastic
    follies.</p>
    <p>I have shown elsewhere the psychological considerations which make Americans accept
    this liability to error as an evil less than that of hypocritical</p>
    <p>{730}</p>
    <p>scepticism. The condition is, of course, somewhat similar to that produced by the
    administration of cocaine and the analogy is confirmed by the fact that American nerves
    are ragged and raw. The realities of life wreck their victim. In case of a general
    collapse of civilization under economic stress, such as seem actually imminent at present,
    it is to be feared that the shock to their spiritual self-sufficiency will find them
    unable to resist reactions. America, resenting the arrogance of Europe, refuses angrily to
    admit the extent of her indebtedness, but in the case of European anarchy, the main source
    of energy would be withdrawn. Few Americans realize that the moral, economic and selfish
    attitude towards sex means ultimate disaster. The emancipation of women, her ambition to
    compete with men in commercial and intellectual pursuits is, at bottom, a refusal to bear
    children, and this evidently implies the excessive increase of a parasitic class which the
    community will be unable to support.</p>
    <p>It is notorious that the birth-rate is maintained by the immigrants. After very few
    years of life in the States sterility sets in. This, again, is a symptom of the insensate
    idealism of American psychology. Perceiving that progress depends on transcending
    animality, and refusing to realize the theoretical limitation of any such aspiration, they
    plunge into perdition. It is as if a man, admiring the beauty and perfume of the
    water-lily and loathing the miry darkness of the bed of the lake, were to sever the
    blossom from its root. This fatuity is shown directly by their attitude towards sex and
    indirectly by the attempt to suppress everything that suggests self-indulgence. The policy
    is disastrous.</p>
    <p>We should found society upon a caste of &quot;men of earth&quot;, sons of the soil,
    sturdy, sensual, stubborn and stupid, unemasculated by ethical or intellectual education,
    but guided in their evolution by the intelligent governing classes towards an ideal of
    pure animal perfection. In such a substratum variation will produce sporadic individuals
    of a higher type. History affords innumerable examples of the lofty intelligence and the
    noblest characters shooting up from the grossest stock. Keats, Burns, Sixtus the Fifth,
    Lincoln, Boehme, Faraday, Joseph Smith, Whitman, Renan, Arkwright, Watts, Carlyle, Rodin
    and innumerable other men of the highest genius came of peasant parentage. Few indeed of
    the first class have been born of intellectually developed families.</p>
    <p>The conditions of genius are not accurately known. But we may divide the class into two
    great groups; those in whom the development is a system of degeneration, and those who,
    though sometimes exhibiting the most exquisite fruition, fail to attain full development
    and achieve the work of which they should be capable through their frailty. The men whose
    achievement is uniform are always constitutionally robust; despite all difficulties they
    attain a great age and produce continuously. Rodin, Browning,</p>
    <p>{731}</p>
    <p>Carlyle, Pasteur, Lister, Kelvin, Gladstone, Whitman were all grand old men. (That
    Carlyle was an invalid merely emphasizes this essential figure.)</p>
    <p>To insure the supply, we need only plant a prosperous and prolific peasantry, watch the
    children for indications of genius, and pick out any promising specimens for special
    training on the lines which their tendencies indicate. The worst thing they can do is what
    is done in America, to disenchant the man of earth with his destiny; to fill him with the
    facts and fancies that enthral etiolated and degenerated idealists and unfit him for his
    evident purpose, that of supplying society with supermen. It is not only impossible to try
    to make a silk purse our of a sow's ear. It is an idealistic imbecility. The demand for
    silk purses is extremely limited, whereas sows' ears always come in handy.</p>
    <p>America is seething with anarchy on every plane, because of the constantly changing
    economic conditions, the conflict between creeds, casts, codes, cultures and races.
    Society has never had a chance to settle down. The expansion westward, the discovery of
    gold, coal, iron and oil, the slavery question, the secession question, the constant flux
    caused by the development of technical science, the religious and moral instability, the
    conflict between federal centralization and state sovereignty, the congestion of cities,
    the exploitation of the farmer by the financier, the shifting of the economic centre of
    gravity, these and a thousand other conditions arising from the unprecedented development
    of the country combine to make it impossible even to imagine stability in any plane of
    life. There is thus a radical distinction between Europe and her daughter. We know more or
    less what to expect in any set of circumstances. Heterogeneous as we are there is a common
    ground of thought and action. We are even able to draw reasonable conclusions about Asia
    and Africa. London and Tokyo are sufficiently alike in essentials to make our relations
    intelligible, but in spite of the community of language, customs, commercial conventions,
    and so on, between London and New York, the difference between us is really more radical.
    There are many incalculable factors in any formula which connects the United States with
    Europe.</p>
    <p>Let me give a few obvious illustrations. Almost all Europeans suppose skyscrapers to be
    monstrosities of vanity. They are in fact necessary consequences of the conditions of New
    York City, as fogs were of the climate and situation of London and the physical properties
    of the available fuel. New York expanded as it had on account of, first, the vastness of
    its harbour, and, second, its situation on the Hudson, and as the most convenient outlet
    for the produce of the hinterland.</p>
    <p>Manhattan Island, being so long and narrow, presented peculiar problems of
    transportation. To this is due the system of elevated and underground</p>
    <p>{732}</p>
    <p>railways. The width of the water which separates if from Long Island, New York State
    and New Jersey limited its expansion in those directions. Even with bridges and subways,
    transport was tedious and congested. The evident consequence was that the value of land in
    Manhattan became prohibitive. The final determinant is the fact that the island consists
    of a scant deposit of soil on a foundation of granite capable of supporting any possible
    strain. It was accordingly an architectural possibility and an economic advantage to
    increase the height of the buildings, and this height was, in its turn, limited by
    economic considerations.</p>
    <p>The early architects went gaily ahead. They saw no reason to suppose that they need
    ever stop, but presently actuarial calculation showed that thirty-six storeys represented
    the maximum of economic efficiency. Beyond that height the disproportionate increase in
    the cost of building and the difficulty of renting the loftier suites, on account of the
    fear of fire, made the higher buildings unprofitable. It is of perculiar interest, by the
    way, to observe that the artists were so impregnated with with the Buddhist ideal of
    impermanence that in even the costliest buildings they calculated the life of the plumbing
    as at no more than twenty years; that is, they expected, from one cause or another, that
    the building would be superseded within that period.</p>
    <p>The actual situation, by the way, is critical. There are, roughly speaking, two and a
    half of the seven and a half million people of Great New York put to grave inconvenience
    by the congestion and all alike are embarrassed by the ratio of rent to income. In Europe
    we reckon that rent should not absorb more than one tenth or at most one eighth of one's
    earning. In New York, this proportion is rarely less than one fourth and sometimes more
    than on third. Again, despite all efforts to establish a satisfactory system of transport,
    conditions are appalling. In the rush hours, the people are crushed like corn in a mill.
    One sees clusters of citizens hanging to the steps of a trolley car like a swarm of bees.
    The surface traffic is practically paralysed. I have know it take fifty minutes for a
    motor bus to get from 34th to 58th Street, walkable easily in less than twenty minutes.
    Except the few plutocrats with automobiles of their own, or residences within reasonable
    distance of their places of business, the average citizen has anything from fifty minutes
    to two hours to travel in this packed and pestilential conveyance twice daily. The waste
    of energy, the nervous strain, the physical fatigue and the annoyance all tell on his
    health and spirits. No wonder if indigestion and neurasthenia make him an old man at
    thirty-five.</p>
    <p>But the worst is yet to come. Every year the congestion increases. The percentage of
    time and strength and money wasted and unnatural effort becomes more oppressive and
    exhaustive. Every desperate device imaginable is being tried,but the problem grows faster
    than the palliatives and one really wonders what will happen when things reach a deadlock,
    when</p>
    <p>{733}</p>
    <p>nobody can pay his rent or get to his business; when, in short, it becomes impossible
    to carry on, what will follow the crash. Any diminution in the population would mean that
    rates and taxes would have to be further increased and so drive more and more away from
    the city. The logical issue seems to be desertion and decay; this obviously involving the
    collapse of the machinery of export, and so the ruin of the producer in the interior.</p>
    <p>In the past, if my suspicions be sound, cities like Nineveh perished in some such way.
    Their prosperity led them to live beyond their means. They made up the deficit by
    constantly bleeding the provinces, thus eventually killing the goose the laid the golden
    eggs. To me, the present prosperity of the United States, like that of England under Queen
    Victoria, is due to the coincidence of various favourable but temporary conditions. In
    England, the invention of the spinning jenny, the steam engine and similar automatic ways
    of producing wealth, the opening up of new markets, the expansion of commerce and colonial
    success made us rich factiously. Similar processes are still at work in the States.</p>
    <p>The vast wealth in almost every commodity became easy to exploit through the
    introduction of scientific methods and labour-saving machinery. The supply of cheap labour
    from exhausted Europe, and the removal of all restrictions to expansion by the extent of
    elbow room and the overcoming of natural obstacles; all these conditions have made America
    the commercial mistress of the planet.</p>
    <p>She has not even been disturbed and hampered by any serious internal or external
    struggle since 1865. The Spanish War was a holiday and the A. E. F. little more than an
    organized extension of the normal tide of tourists. She has never had to fight for her
    life; she has never had a serious sickness, but now this curve is approaching if it has
    not already attained its summit. The colonization is complete. People are beginning to
    jostle each other. Europe can no longer pay for her produce. The absence of moral unity is
    creating class conflict. The problems of politics are too vast and varied for even genius
    to grasp; the apparatus of order, both moral and physical, is showing signs of an imminent
    breakdown. The interests of the five principal sections of the country become more
    obviously incompatible. Any serious setback might cause disaster in a dozen different
    directions.</p>
    <p>They talk of the melting pot. The metaphor is not bad. For the last sixty years they
    have pitched into it indiscriminately everything that came along. They protest
    passionately that the product must be that perfect gold, the &quot;one hundred per cent.
    American&quot;, which may be defined as the wish phantasms of a Sunday School
    superintendent, a romantic flapper, an unscrupulous usurer, and a maudlin medium, worked
    up into a single delirious nightmare. More likely the interaction of all these formidable
    forces will result in an explosion. My faith in the future of the States is fixed on</p>
    <p>{734}</p>
    <p>some rational reconstruction after revolution. The present attempt to amalgamate this
    fortuitous hotch-potch, neither calculating probabilities nor observing actualities, but
    asserting an amiable postulate as if it were axiomatic, is born of an illusion invented by
    despair of acting with intelligence; and when the moment of awakening arrives the
    disillusionment may shock them at first into insanity. Nothing less is likely to show them
    that human nature is a stubborn reality which no amount of humouring, befooling and
    bullying will alter.</p>
    <p>These preliminary speculations set forth, I will now try to justify the diagnosis by
    exhibiting the salient symptom. For convenience I have classed my observations under a few
    principal heads. I shall show how America differs from Europe in its attitude towards law
    and order. I shall give examples of the unfathomable ignorance which prevails even among
    the most highly educated people, not merely of well established facts of what in Europe is
    called common knowledge, but of the most elementary principles of nature, that is to say
    of facts which quite illiterate Europeans would know instinctively without having to learn
    them. I shall give examples of the impotence of their extravagant idealism to preserve
    them from outraging European convention of honour and good manners. Lastly, I shall
    illustrate the callousness and cruelty which characterize the people as a result of their
    fanatical faith in absolute standards of rectitude and definition of duty to one's
    neighbour as espionage and tyranny. I will ask the reader to analyse each incident in
    order to discover the simple and radical motive which underlies the overt action. I hope
    thus to make it clear that even the most absurd and atrocious abominations are, so to
    speak, accidents caused by the impact of facts with which the American is unfitted to
    deal, owing to his childlike ignorance, inexperience and lack of all sense of proportion;
    so that to every crisis he can bring only the intense impulsive energy of instinct.</p>
    <p>In 1912 I took it into my head to write three essays on American art and literature,
    past, present and future. I only completed the first, which is published in the <em>English
    Review</em>. It aroused a hurricane across the Atlantic and, hard as it is to believe, the
    echoes have not yet died away.</p>
    <p>Within the last twelve months it was violently attacked by one of America's best poets,
    Robert Haven Schauffler. I make a point of mentioning the fact. He accused me of prejudice
    and unfairness, ignorant of course that my essay was but one of three and that my plan had
    been to express the friendliest faith in the future. As it stands, my judgment is no doubt
    severe, but I see little to modify.</p>
    <p>Poe and Whitman are still in my opinion the only first-rate writers until very recent
    years. I still find Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier, Emerson, Bret</p>
    <p>{735}</p>
    <p>Harte, Mark Twain and the rest devoid of any title soever to rank among the sons of
    genius. I might admit that they possessed great talents, but that is foreign to the
    question. I had been prevented from writing the other two essays partly because the
    editor, following his invariable rule, broke his pledged word to me, and partly because my
    heart was broken by the perusal of the books which I had asked Leila Waddell to bring back
    from America to furnish me with material. They left me without a glimmer of hope. The
    trashiest piffle of England was Swinburne and Stevenson by comparison. The morality of
    American authors was too ghastly to contemplate. The artistic unity of the entire output
    consisted in its commonplace coarseness, behind which was the fixed determination to go
    for the dollars. There was neither ambition nor conscience anywhere. My already zero
    opinion dropped below the liquid air mark.</p>
    <p>My first personal acquaintance with the actual conditions of the present time did not
    improve matters noticeably. My first glimmer of hope was supplied by the &quot;candle and
    the flame&quot; of George Sylvester Viereck. Here at least was a man with a mind of his
    own, a worthy aspiration and an excellent technique, even though the actual achievement
    was nothing to leave home for. His prose was better. The <em>Confessions of a Barbarian</em>
    which purport to describe Europe are excellent. Europe is the stalking horse from behind
    which he shoots his wit. Every shot tells, and all are aimed at America. No better study
    of the United States has ever been written.</p>
    <p>Through Viereck I met his friend Alexander Harvey who professed to admire my work and
    offered me the opportunity to reciprocate. At first I failed. I had somehow got the fine
    idea that he lacked virility and seriousness, and that his work was a shadow show. I had
    not understood my author. Only after reading <em>Shelley's Elopement</em> and his book on
    Howells did I attain full insight into his mind and manner. But, having done so, a great
    light dawned upon me. I had to acknowledge him as a master. In the series of essays on
    which I am working at present I have consecrated one to him. I need only observe there
    that Alexander Harvey, more subtle and ethereal than Poe himself, possesses a delicacy and
    a sense of humour as exquisite, elfish, elusive as any man that ever wrote. His irony is
    incomparably keen. That I should have missed the point taught me a much needed lesson.</p>
    <p>To pick up a book, persuaded that no good thing can come out of Nazareth, makes
    appreciation impossible.</p>
    <p>Harvey introduced me to Edwin Markham, whose <em>The Man with the Hoe, and other poems</em>
    is assuredly first-rate of its kind. His work is uneven and it would be absurd to assert
    that he is of outstanding excellence. He lacks the stature of the sacred legion, but at
    least he proved to me the existence of what I had till then doubted; a poet true to
    himself and fearless of opinion; capable oh high aims, conscientious in pursuing them and</p>
    <p>{736}</p>
    <p>courageous in proclaiming them. I looked about me from that moment for a second poet,
    but here indefatigable research proved fruitless. Self-styled poets and poetesses are as
    common in America as common bacilli in a choleraic colon. They swim and squeal and
    squabble and stink unbelievably.</p>
    <p>The principal poetess present was E. W. Wilcox, looking exactly like a shaved sow
    plastered with brilliant unguents in a Greek dress and with a wreath on her wig. It was to
    vomit! In Europe, outside negligible cliques in Soho, buzzing round people like Ezra Pound
    and even smaller patchers of pretence in Paris, poets have some sense of dignity. They do
    try to write, and talk as little as possible about it. In America poetry is a branch of
    the patent medicine business. The medicine does not matter; what does is the label, the
    puff and the faked testimonial.</p>
    <p>A very few manage somehow or other to turn out occasional stanzas, with some kind of
    idea in them fluently and even powerfully, but with the exception of Markham and
    Schauffler there is practically nobody at all who even understands what poetry means. The
    one aim is self advertisement.</p>
    <p>In the matter of prose, the situation is altogether different. As remarked elsewhere,
    the first urgent need of the country is a critic whose words carry weight, who knows good
    from bad, and could not be bullied or bribed. These were found in William Marion Ready,
    Michael Monahan and H. L. Mencken. The two former were not fully efficient. They were too
    refined to take off their shirts and plunge head foremost into the rough and tumble, but
    Mencken understood the psychology of the cattle he was out to kill, and he poleaxed them
    properly. Having thus secured the services of of a fighting editor the rest of the staff
    felt free to do their work as they wanted it done and the result has been the startling
    sudden appearance of a regular army of authors and even dramatists who really matter.
    Conditions being as they are all red revolutionists are necessarily savage satirists; they
    dare not waste time in wooing beauty till the war is won. We find, therefore, Theodore
    Dreiser, Lewis Sinclair (as opposed to his hysterical, though well-intentioned, namesake
    Upton) and others of their school, who seem to regard themselves as a committee appointed
    to report on the ravages of respectability. Novel after novel describes unflinchingly the
    realities of life in America in its various departments.</p>
    <p>Upton Sinclair and his school fail by overdoing it. Their sentimental indignation is
    just as false as the shop on the other side of the street. Howells and Chambers and all
    those pullulating boosters of the red-blooded, clean living hundred per cent. Gibson young
    man and his female rival them in invertebrate idealism. But the new school of realism
    makes a point of being just. The characters live; they are not mere excuses for piling up
    epithets. Yet beneath the feet of the actors is the stage and behind them a background.</p>
    <p>{737}</p>
    <p>That stage is rotten. The foundation is equally social injustice and moral falsity. The
    background is equally bad. The scene is set for an obscene farce. The work of this school
    is at last beginning to tell. A constantly increasing percentage of Americans are
    beginning to understand that the vague horror which haunted them is the miasma of
    manufactured immorality. They see that the deliberate attempt to standardize social
    conditions, to trample originality under foot, to ostracize genius, to discipline life in
    every detail is turning the land of the free into a convict settlement and modelling
    civilization upon that of the ant.</p>
    <p>Alexander Harvey stands outside this body of Warriors. His spirit is less in touch with
    the brutalities of daily life. His race is unblemished and he began his career in
    diplomacy. He was thus able to develop his fine and intricate passion for pure beauty
    without being constantly jostled by the hurrying fiends of commerce. He is able to treat
    American society as a joke. His characters are, for the most part, raised above the hubbub
    of hustle. America wounds him only in his spiritual nerves. The most hideous of the demons
    which haunts him is what he calls the native American of Anglo-Saxon origin and his ivory
    is aimed at the less obvious atrocities of his environment.</p>
    <p>One other figure stands apart, olympic and titanic in one. As I have tried to show in
    my essay (<em>The Reviewer</em>, July 1923) James Branch Cabell is a world genius of
    commanding stature. He comes of famous stock and occupies an excellent social position,
    being secluded on his own property in Virginia. The turmoil of Main Street and the animal
    noises of the jungle are born to him as echoes from afar. The realities of modern America
    consequently occupy only one salient of his battle front, which extends from the seat of
    Jove himself to deepest Tartarus. All periods of history contribute to his pages and his
    characters include personifications of eternal principles, legendary demons an monsters of
    every type; eponymous heroes of fables and romance, and the everyday individuals of the
    modern world. Between these infinitely diverse orders of being, he makes no difference.
    All are equally real and mingle freely with each other. His epic includes Mother Cerida,
    one of the seven powers of destiny, her function being to cancel everything out. Helen of
    Troy, Merlin, the tyrant Dionysys and President Roosevelt fall each one in the proper
    place. His thesis covers the whole field of philosophy, but its ultimate conclusion --- to
    date --- seems to be almost identical with that of Main Street: that all aspiration is
    futile, attainment impossible in the nature of things.</p>
    <p>Like James Thomson, however, as I have demonstrated in my essay on him, he has so
    extended the scope of his argument as to leave no possible escape by withdrawal to some
    loftier plane. Nevertheless, his intellectual acquiescence in the ineluctable futility of
    life, his gentle blood and his godlike</p>
    <p>{738}</p>
    <p>genius compel him to make an irrational exception of this law in some quite
    inexplicable manner, and heroism wins through. Even as things stand, I regard Cabell as by
    far the greatest genius of his genus that has yet appeared on this planet. Before him
    nobody ever conceived so all-embracing a theme. Yet I am still unsatisfied! I demand that
    he shall be developed towards the solution of his problem, and perceive that the
    contradictory thesis is equally true: that the most trivial, vain and fatuous events, if
    rightly understood, are sublime; that the slough of despond is but an optical illusion
    created by the shadow of the snow-pure summits of success.</p>
    <p>I have been accused of exaggerated enthusiasm for Cabell. The more stupid and
    mean-minded have even explained my ardour by my appreciation of the compliment which Mr
    Cabell paid me by using my Gnostic Mass as the material for Chapter XXII of his <em>Jurgen</em>.
    The suggestion is utter rubbish; though, at the same time, I admit cordially that no other
    form of appreciation of my work would have pleased me half so well.</p>
    <p>I regard his epic of such supreme importance to mankind as an exposition of the nature
    of the universe that I have not only sent him a copy of <em>The Book of the Law</em> in
    the hope that he may find in it the way out of his Buddhistic demonstration that
    &quot;everything is sorrow&quot; but followed it up by letter after letter urging him to
    use it, for his work cannot attain perfection until it culminates in a positive
    conclusion.</p>
    <p>For many years he toiled at his task almost neglected. It is hardly nice to reflect
    that he only became famous when the smut-smeller society succeeded in suppressing
    &quot;Jurgen&quot; as obscene. I must admit, none the less, that when <em>Beyond Life</em>
    was sent me for review (the first I had heard of him) while perceiving straight away its
    excellence, I had no idea of its importance. It let the matter rest there. Then <em>Jurgen</em>
    reached me and I saw at once not only that the book was a supreme masterpiece, but
    extended my understanding of its stable companion. I proceeded to grab as many of his
    books as I could. Each volume opened a new world to my vision. It was not clear why he had
    not impressed even the best critics as he deserved. Nobody had seen that each volume,
    apparently self-sufficient, was in reality one chapter, a single vast epic. The more I
    read and re-read, the more fully I realize the extent of his empire.</p>
    <p>I have gone into this at some length in order to firstly stress the importance of the
    work, and to prevent any reader supposing that any one book will give an adequate idea of
    his genius.</p>
