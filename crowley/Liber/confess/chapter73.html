    <p>In the early part of 1913, my work had apparently settled down to a regular routine.
    Everything went very well but nothing startling occurred. On March 3rd, the &quot;Ragged
    Ragtime Girls&quot; opened at the Old Tivoli. It was an immediate success and relieved my
    mind of all preoccupations with worldly affairs. Most of my time was devoted to developing
    the work of the O.T.O. In May I took a short holiday in France and the Channel Islands.
    Only one incident is worthy of record. I had gone down to my beloved Forest of
    Fontainebleau for a walk. One morning, climbing the Rocher d'Avon, I saw a serpent cross
    my path. A little higher the same thing happened. This time I was impelled to kill the
    reptile, which I did.</p>
    <p>I took it into my head that the Masters had sent this as a warning that treachery was
    at work in London. I returned and found that Cremers was intriguing against me; and that,
    in particular, she had corrupted the heart of Leila Waddell. The O.H.O., moreover, had
    found out that the Grand Hierophant of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, John
    Yarker, had died some months earlier and that his death had been concealed from his
    colleagues by the machinations of a sort of man named Wedgwood, in the interest of Annie
    Besant who wanted to obtain control of the Rite. The outrage was baroque, it being the
    first condition of membership that the candidate should be a freemason in good standing
    under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of England. However the conspirators had
    illegally convened a secret council at Manchester to elect a successor to Yarker. I was
    deputed to attend and convey the protests of the various Grand Masters on the continent. I
    did so. I challenged the legality of the council. I showed that Wedgwood was not a
    freemason at all. I exposed the whole intrigue. At the conclusion of my speech (printed in
    <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, No. X</a>) the meeting
    was adjourned <em>sine die</em>. A council was then legally convened; and a man designated
    by Yarker himself as his successor in one of his last letters to me was elected Grand
    Master for Britain, with myself as his principal officer. Yarker's office as Grand
    Hierophant was filled by Dr. Encausse (Papus), the Grand Master of France.</p>
    <p>Having accomplished these duties, I was free to accompany the &quot;Ragged Ragtime
    Girls&quot; to Moscow, where they were engaged for the summer, at the Aquarium. They were
    badly in need of protection. Leila Waddell was the only one with a head on her shoulders.
    Of the other six, three were dipsomanics, four nymphomaniacs, two hysterically prudish,
    and all</p>
    <p>{711}</p>
    <p>ineradicably convinced that outside England everyone was a robber, ravisher and
    assassin. They all carried revolvers, which they did not know how to use; though prepared
    to do so on the first person who spoke to them.</p>
    <p>At the Russian frontier, we plunged from civilization and order, headlong into
    confusion and anarchy. No one on the train could speak a word even of German. We were
    thrown out at Warsaw into a desolation which could hardly have been exceeded had we
    dropped on the moon. At last we found a loafer who spoke a little German, but no man knew
    or cared about the trains to Moscow. We ultimately drove to another station. A train was
    due to leave, but they would not find us accommodation. We drove once more across the
    incoherent city and this time found room in a train which hoped to go to Moscow at the
    average rate of some ten miles an hour. The compartment contained shelves covered with
    loose dirty straw on which the passengers indiscriminately drank, gambled, quarrelled and
    made love. There was no discipline, no order, no convenience. At first I blamed myself, my
    ignorance of the language and so on, for the muddle in Warsaw; but the British counsul
    told me that he had himself been held up there by railway mismanagement on one occasion
    for forty-eight hours. When we reached Moscow there was no one at the station who could
    take charge of our part. We found an hotel for ourselves, and rooms for the girls, more by
    good luck than design. About one in the morning they sent for Leila to rescue them. She
    found them standing on rickety tables, screaming with fear. The had been attacked by
    bed-bugs. Luckily I had warned Leila that in Russia the bug is as inseparable from the bed
    as the snail from his shell.</p>
    <p>In a day or two things calmed down. Then there came suddenly upon me a period of
    stupendous spiritual impulse --- even more concentrated than that of 1911. In a café, I
    met a young Hungarian girl named Anny Ringler; tall, tense, lean as a starving leopardess,
    with wild insatiable eyes and a long straight thin mouth, a scarlet scar which seemed to
    ache with the anguish of hunger for some satisfaction beyond earth's power to supply. We
    came together with irresistible magnetism. We could not converse in human language. I had
    forgotten nearly all my Russian; and her German was confined to a few broken cries. But we
    had not need of speech. The love between us was ineffably intense. It still inflames my
    inmost spirit. She had passed beyond the region where pleasure had meaning for her. She
    could only feel through pain, and my own means of making her happy was to inflict physical
    cruelties as she directed. This kind of relation was altogether new to me; and it was
    perhaps because of this, intensified as it was by the environment of the self-torturing
    soul of Russia, that I became inspired to create for the next six weeks.</p>
    <p>How stupid it is, by the way, that one is obliged to use words in senses inappropriate
    to, and sometimes incompatible with, the meaning which</p>
    <p>{712}</p>
    <p>one wishes to convey! Thus the idea of cruelty is bound up with that of the
    unwillingness of the patient, so that in the case of masochism the use of the word is
    ridiculous. We fail to see straight on such points whenever they concern emotional
    complexes like love. Love, that is, as the wrong- headed Anglo-Saxon defines it. We do not
    call it cruel to offer a man a cigar, though a small boy may suffer intensely from smoking
    one. An enormous amount of erroneous thinking springs from the mental laziness which
    allows us to acquiesce in a standardized relation between two things which is, in fact,
    dependent upon occasional conditions.</p>
    <p>This constantly leads to the grossest injustice and stupidity. Words like
    &quot;miscreant&quot;, &quot;atheist&quot; and similar terms of abuse in matters which
    excite the emotions of the vulgar, are constantly applied as labels to people whom they
    nowise fit. For instance, Huxley was branded as a materialist, Thomas Paine as an atheist,
    when they were nothing of the sort. It was particularly annoying during the war to observe
    the indiscriminate plastering of people with such mud as &quot;pro-German&quot;,
    &quot;pacifist&quot;, &quot;Bolshevist&quot;, etc., without the slightest reference to
    their actual opinions. The proof of the pudding is in the eating; my relations with Anny
    must be judged by their fruits; happiness, inspiration, spirituality and romantic
    idealism.</p>
    <p>I saw Anny almost every day for an hour or so. The rest of my time I spent (for the
    most part) in the gardens of the Hermitage or the Aquarium, writing for dear life. In
    Moscow, in the summer months, day fades into night, night brightens into day with
    imperceptible subtlety. There is a spiritual clarity in the air itself which is
    indescribable. From time to time the bells reinforce the silence with an unearthly music
    which never jars or tires. The hours stream by so intoxicatingly that the idea of time
    itself disappears from consciousness.</p>
    <p>In all that I wrote in those six weeks, I doubt if there is a single word of Anny. She
    was the soul of my expression, and so beyond the possibility of speech; but she lifted me
    to heights of ecstasy that I had never before consciously attained and revealed to me
    secrets deeper than I ever deemed. I wrote things that I knew not and made no mistake. My
    work was infinitely varied, yet uniformly distinguished. I expressed the soul of Moscow in
    a poem &quot;The City
    of God</a>&quot;, published some months afterwards in the <em>English Review</em>. It is a
    &quot;hashish dream come true&quot;. Every object of sense, from the desolation of the
    steppes and the sheer architecture of the city, to the art, attitude and amusements of the
    people, stings one to the soul, each an essential element of a supreme sacrament. At the
    same time, the reality of all these things, using the word in its grossest sense,
    consummates the marriage of the original antinomies which exist in one's mind between the
    ideal and the actual.</p>
    <p>A prose pendant to this poem is my essay &quot;The Heart of Holy Russia&quot;,</p>
    <p>{713}</p>
    <p>which many Russians competent to judge have assured me struck surer to the soul of
    Russia than anything of Dostoyevsky. Their witness fills me with more satisfaction as to
    the worth of my work than anything else has ever done.</p>
    <p>Another poem, &quot;Morphia&quot;, has no ostensible reference to Russia, but the
    insight into the psychology of the &quot;addict&quot; was indubitably conferred by my
    illumination. I had no experience, even at second hand, of the effects of the drug; yet I
    was assured by a distinguished man of letters who had himself suffered from its malice,
    that I have expressed to the utmost the terrific truth. He could hardly believe at first
    that I had written it without actual knowledge.</p>
    <p>During this period the full interpretation of the central mystery of freemasonry became
    clear in consciousness, and I expressed it in dramatic form in &quot;the Ship</a>&quot;. The lyrical climax is in some respects
    my supreme achievement in invocation; in fact, the chorus beginning:</p>
    <p align="center">Thou who art I beyond all I am ...</p>
    <p>seemed to me worthy to be introduced as the anthem into the Ritual of the Gnostic
    Catholic Church which, later in the year, I prepared for the use of the O.T.O., the
    central ceremony of its public and private celebration, corresponding to the Mass of the
    Roman Catholic Church.</p>
    <p>While dealing with this subject I may as well outline its scope completely. Human
    nature demands (in the case of most people) the satisfaction of the religious instinct,
    and, to very many, this may best be done by ceremonial means. I wished therefore to
    construct a ritual through which people might enter into ecstasy as they have always done
    under the influence of appropriate ritual. In recent years, there has been an increasing
    failure to attain this object, because the established cults shock their intellectual
    convictions and outrage their common sense. Thus their minds criticize their enthusiasm;
    they are unable to consummate the union of their individual souls with the universal soul
    as a bridegroom would be to consummate his marriage if his love were constantly reminded
    that its assumptions were intellectually absurd.</p>
    <p>I resolved that my ritual should celebrate the sublimity of the operation of universal
    forces without introducing disputable metaphysical theories. I would neither make nor
    imply any statement about nature which would not be endorsed by the most materialistic man
    of science. On the surface this may sound difficult; but in practice I found it perfectly
    simple to combine the most rigidly rational conceptions of phenomena with the most exalted
    and enthusiastic celebration of their sublimity. (This ritual has been published in <em>The
    International</em>, New York, March 1918, and in <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. III, No. 1</a>.)</p>
    <p>{714}</p>
    <p>Numerous other poems, essays and short stories were written during this summer. In
    particular there is a sort of novel, <em>The Lost Continent</em>, purporting to give an
    account of the civilization of Atlantis. I sometimes feel that this lacks artistic unity.
    At times it is a fantastic rhapsody describing my ideals of Utopian society; but some
    passages are a satire on the conditions of our existing civilization, while others convey
    hints of certain profound magical secrets, or anticipations of discoveries in science.</p>
    <p>From my brief description of the conditions of travel in Russia, the intelligent should
    be able to deduce what I thought of the immediate political future of the country. I
    returned to England with the settled conviction that in the event of a serious war (the
    scrap with Japan was really an affair of outposts, like our own Boer War) the ataxic giant
    would collapse within a few months. England's traditional fear of Slav aggression seemed
    to me ridiculous; and France's faith in her ally, pathetic. The event has more than
    justified my vision. I have no detailed knowledge of politics;, but, just as my essay,
    &quot;The Heart of Holy Russia&quot;, told the inmost truth without even superficial
    knowledge of the facts which were its symptoms, so I possess an immediate intuition of the
    of the state of a country without cognizance of the statistics. I am thus in the position
    of Cassandra, foreseeing and foretelling fate, while utterly unable to compel conviction.</p>
    <p>I cannot leave the subject of Russia without rescuing from oblivion some of the
    significant stories which I had from the excellent British consul, Mr. Groves. The most
    deliciously fantastic is that of what I may call the phantom battleship. This vessel cost
    well over two million sterling. She was to be the last word in naval construction. She was
    launched at Odessa in the presence of a great gathering of notables, and the scene
    lavishly photographed and described in the newspapers. Alas! upon her maiden cruise she
    was <em>spurlos versenkt</em>. The fact of the matter was that she had never existed! Her
    cost had gone straight into the pockets of the various officials, the photographs were
    simply faked, and the descriptions imaginary.</p>
    <p>Here is another ray of searchlight on Russian rottenness. A crisis had arisen between
    England and France. A strong Chauvinist element was urging the government to hurl a flat
    defiance at St James'. The Minister of Marine was asked to report on the readiness of the
    French navy. He replied in terms of absolute confidence; but within an hour of his doing
    so, one of his officers came to him in agitation and begged him to make a personal
    inspection of the arsenal at Toulon. He rushed south on an express engine and found that
    the fortress was absolutely denuded of munitions. They had been quietly sold off by a gang
    of dishonest officials and the reports systematically falsified.</p>
    <p>On this discovery, he advised the President to agree with England quickly while he was
    in the way with her, which was done. The Russian ambassador</p>
    <p>{715}</p>
    <p>got wind of this affair; it suddenly struck him that Sebastopol might be in the same
    street as Toulon; he hurried to St Petersburg and put the matter personally before the
    Tsar. Investigation proved his fears well-founded. The Tsar was roused to bite. Every
    officer above a certain rank was left in a room with a revolver. They had the choice
    between suicide and shameful execution. Naturally, they all chose the former and the whole
    affair was hushed up by reporting their decease from sickness, accident and so on during
    the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>At Vladivostok corruption was so universal and open that on pay day an agent of the
    contractor sat at the next desk to the naval paymaster and handed each man his share of
    the profits of the organized system of swindling the government.</p>
    <p>One last luminous anecdote. The representative of a Birmingham munition factory called
    on our consul about some permit or other, and told him the following story. The Russian
    naval agent in England had accepted the tender of his firm for supplying an immense number
    of shells. &quot;About the price, now,&quot; he said to the managing director, &quot;of
    course we pay you a hundred and fifty thousand pounds&quot; (or whatever it was) &quot;but
    understand that so much of this must go to Admiral A., so much to Councillor B., so much
    to the Grand Duke C.&quot; --- a long list followed. &quot;My dear sir,&quot; cried the
    Englishman, aghast, &quot;surely I have made it plain that our price is bed rock. We
    shan't take a penny of profit. We only put in so low a tender because trade is so bad and
    we don't want to shut down.&quot; The Russian spread his hands mournfully. &quot;Why, hang
    it,&quot; exclaimed the manufacturer. &quot;If we were to allow you all those rake-offs,
    we should have to make the shells of tinfoil and load them with sawdust.&quot; The Russian
    brightened instantly. &quot;But exactly,&quot; said he; &quot;how I admire you practical
    English! I knew you would find a way out.&quot; And that was how they settled the
    business, and those were the shells with which Rodjiestvenski was sent round the world to
    meet the navy of Japan.</p>
    <p>Our own red tape was responsible for a really Gilbertian stupidity in consular matters.
    It had been decided to raise Moscow from a consulate to a consulate-general. Mr Groves had
    been for many years in Moscow and spoke practically no Polish. Our consul at Warsaw had
    been in that city also for many years and spoke practically no Russian. But he was senior
    in the service to Groves by a year or so. It was therefore impossible to continue Groves
    at Moscow over the head of the man in Warsaw, and they were therefore ordered to change
    their position, each being ejected from the city whose language he spoke, and whose
    affairs he had by heart, into one where the conditions were utterly unfamiliar and the
    language unintelligible.</p>
    <p>From early boyhood my imagination had been excited by accounts of the Great Fair at
    Nijni Novgorod. Finding &quot;the time and the place and the</p>
    <p>{716}</p>
    <p>loved one all together&quot;, at the cost of a slight effort, I decided to trot off and
    see &quot;The Fun of the Fair&quot;, by which title I called the poem in which I describe
    my excursion. The way in which I wrote it is, I imagine, unique in literature. I wrote
    down in heroic couplets every incident of the adventure exactly as it occurred and when it
    occurred. The only variation is that occasionally I permit myself to exaggerate the facts
    (as in enumerating the races of men whom I met) when the spirit of humour takes charge.</p>
    <p>This poem should have appeared in the <em>English Review</em> in the autumn of 1914. It
    was pushed out to make way for my &quot;Appeal to the American Republic&quot;, reprinted
    from boyhood's happy days, with such politically necessary revisions as &quot;the traitor
    Prussian&quot; instead of &quot;the traitor Russian&quot;. It has thus never yet seen the
    light.</p>
