    <p>It had never occurred to me that rock climbing, as such, might be a recognized sport.
    However, my mother and I were at the Sligachan Inn in Skye during the summer of 1892. I
    talked about my hill rambles with Sir Joseph Lister, who happened to be staying there, and
    asked him about the Coolins. He was kind enough to suggest to some real climbers who were
    staying at the hotel to include me in their party the next day, and they were kind enough
    to take me up Sgurr-nan-Gillean by the Pinnacle Ridge. I found myself up against it; and
    realized at once that there was something more to be done than scrambling.</p>
    <p>I think it was the following summer that I was staying at a farm in Langdale and heard
    from the natives of the celebrated twenty-four hours' walk. The idea is to climb the four
    highest fells, Scafell Pikes, Helvellyn, Skiddaw and Saddleback, in a day. I conceived a
    minor ridge walk and set out one morning at dawn from Langdale, climbed the Langdale
    Pikes, and followed the crest of the fells to Scafell Pikes. Then I crossed to Scafell by
    the Broad Stand; and, seeing the Deep Ghyll pinnacle, climbed that on my way to the summit
    of Scafell. It was a terrifically hot day over Lingmell and down into the valley to climb
    the screes of Great Gable. My attention was attracted by the Great Napes Needle and I
    climbed that. Thence I took the easiest way --- the Needle ridge, or a gully, I forget
    which --- to the summit of the mountain. I had become almost insane from heat, thirst and
    exhaustion; I could not longer walk, but crawled on hands and knees down to Sty Head Tarn,
    whose waters revived me to some extent. I struggled on homewards and reached the top of
    Rossett Ghyll Pass shortly after nightfall. There was a bright moon, but I had a terrible
    time picking my way down the path. I must have been a little light-headed from exhaustion
    and there was a Dantesque quality in the long climb among the blinding white patches of
    light and the jetty shadows. At the bottom of the pass I met a small rescue party who had
    just started out to look for me, and reached home about eleven o'clock. It was, in its
    way, a remarkable performance of a boy.</p>
    <p>Another incident is less heroic but more amusing. My tutor had invited his sister to
    stay a few days at the farm at Langdale. One day I took her up the Langdale Pikes and
    found quite decent bit of scrambling. Having not rope, I could only help her from below.
    She became scared and broke into a passionate monologue punctuated by screams. It
    consisted of variations on a triple theme. &quot;I'm going to fall --- Our Father which
    art in heaven ---</p>
    <p>{88}</p>
    <p>don't look at my legs.&quot; Ah me! --- &quot;I learnt about women from 'er.&quot; It
    was a startling complete revelation of the psychology of the well-brought-up young lady.
    Craven fear, prurient shame and narcotic piety: of such is the kingdom of Tennyson!</p>
    <p>The glimpse that I had had of Wastdale attracted me and I went over there. One very wet
    morning I started to climb Scafell, chiefly with the idea of tackling some of the gullies
    which I had noticed in the Great Cliff. I had reached the Grass Traverse when I heard
    voices in the mist above me, and a few minutes later a powerful man with red whiskers and
    a rope about his shoulders came towards me from the cliff. It was J. W. Robinson, a local
    farmer, who had laid the foundation of Cumberland climbing. He offered to show me some of
    the easier climbs. He had started that morning with a man named Owen Glynne Jones. Jones
    had insisted on trying to climb Steep Gill, which is for the most part a shallow gully of
    smooth slabs set at a dangerous angle. There is no reliable hold for hand or foot on the
    main pitch, which is some eighty feet high. As torrents of icy water were pouring over the
    crags, it was sheer foolhardiness to attempt it. Robinson had refused to do so, whereupon
    Jones had quarrelled with him and they had parted.</p>
    <p>I had every reason, later on, to agree with Robinson. I was only once on a rope with
    Jones. It was on Great Gable; the rocks were plastered with ice and a bitter wind was
    blowing. In such conditions one cannot rely on one's fingers. Our party proposed to
    descend the Oblique Chimney on the Ennerdale face. Robinson led the way down. The second
    man was a Pole named Lewkowitch, who was generally known as &quot;Oils, fats and
    waxes&quot;, because of his expert knowledge of them and the personal illustration of
    their properties which he afforded. He had no experience of climbing and weighed about
    sixteen stone. It was up to me, as third man on the rope, to let him slowly down. I had,
    of course, to descend little by little, the rope being too short to allow me to lower him
    from the top. I soon found myself in the most difficult part of the chimney, very ill
    placed to manipulate a dangling ox. I looked up to Jones, the last man, to hold my rope so
    that I could give full attention to Lewkowitch, and saw to my horror that he was
    maintaining his equilibrium by a sort of savage war dance! He was hampered by a
    photographic apparatus which was strapped to his back. Robinson had urged him to lower it
    separately. As nor Einstein or the Blessed Virgin Mary was there to suspend the law of
    gravitation, I have no idea how we got to the bottom undamaged; but when we did I promptly
    took off the rope and walked home, utterly disgusted with the vanity which had endangered
    the party. Of course, there could only be one end to that sort of thing, and Jones ended
    by killing himself and three guides on the Zinal side of the Dent Blanche a few years
    later.</p>
    <p>{89}</p>
    <p>The imbecility of the accident is shown by the fact that the fifth member of the party,
    who was quite a beginner, found himself --- after the smash --- alone on the precipice.
    The guides had begged Jones not to attempt the pitch from which he fell, but he had
    persisted. The fifth man had hitched the rope over a rock and it had broken between him
    and the third guide. But this man, instead of going down to the valley, actually climbed
    the mountain, spent a night on the ridge and went down the next day to Zermatt.</p>
    <p>The dangers of mountaineering are ridiculously exaggerated. I have never known of any
    accident which was not due to ignorance or folly. Eckenstein, the greatest climber of his
    age, told me the same thing.</p>
    <p>Jones obtained the reputation of being the most brilliant rock climber of his time by
    persistent self-advertisement. He was never a first-rate climber, because he was never a
    safe climber. If a handhold was out of his reach he would jump at it, and he had met with
    several serious accidents before the final smash. But his reputation is founded
    principally on climbs which he did not make at all, in the proper sense of the word. He
    used to go out with a couple of photographers and have himself lowered up and down a climb
    repeatedly until he had learnt its peculiarities, and then make the &quot;first
    ascent&quot; before a crowd of admirers. Now the essential difficulty of negotiating a
    pitch of any length is that one has to waste any amount of time and strength while one is
    finding out where the holds are. There is no credit at all in repeating a climb.</p>
    <p>Another trick of Jones' was to get his friends to make dates with other people to try
    various unclimbed places, and then to postpone the expedition on various pretexts until
    Jones had managed to negotiate it by the method above described.</p>
    <p>This conduct seemed to me absolutely unsportsmenlike. To prostitute the mountains to
    personal vanity is in fact something rather worse. And I had a taste of the malice of
    people's envy in my first week. A personal issue arose from the very start. Robinson
    happened to ask me if I had climbed in Wales. I told him yes, and mentioned one particular
    place, the Devil's Kitchen or Twll Dy, which I had climbed by taking off my boots. I had
    no idea that the place was famous, but it was. It was reputed unclimbable. Almighty Jones
    himself had failed. I found myself, to my astonishment, the storm centre. Jones, behind my
    back, accused me flatly of lying. Quite unconsciously, however, I put myself in the right.
    I have always failed to see that it is necessary to make a fuss about one's climbs. There
    is a good reason for describing a first climb. To do so is to guide others to enjoyment.
    One may also for the same reason describe interesting variations of a climb, or its
    accomplishment by a solitary man. Now as it happened, Jones had been blowing his trumpet
    about the first ascent of Kern Knotts Chimney;</p>
    <p>{90}</p>
    <p>the top pitch, however, he had failed to do unaided. He had been hoisted on the
    shoulders of the second man. I went to have a look at it and found that by wedging a stone
    into a convenient crack, and thus starting a foot higher up, I could get to the top, and
    did so. I recorded this in the Climbers' Book; and the following day a man named H. V.
    Reade, possibly in a sceptical mood, followed in my footsteps. He found my wedged stone,
    contemptuously threw it away, climbed the pitch without it, and recorded the feat. That
    was a double blow to Mr. Jones. It was no longer a convincing argument that if he couldn't
    do a thing it couldn't be done.</p>
    <p>But this was not all. Scafell is separated from Scafell Pikes by a pass called
    Mickledoor; and on the Scafell side it is precipitous. The ridge of the pass is
    well-marked; by going down a little, on one side one can climb the cliffs by the Broad
    Stand or Mickeldoor Chimney, on the other side by the North Climb; and so on. But it had
    been the ambition of every climber to start from the exact top of the ridge. This was
    called the direct climb of Mickledoor; and nobody had done it. That seemed to be a shame,
    so I did it. This time the fat was in the fire. My good faith was openly challenged in the
    smoking-room. I shrugged my shoulders, but offered to repeat the climb the following day
    before witnesses --- which I accordingly did. I suppose I am a very innocent ass, but I
    could not understand why anyone calling himself human should start a series of malicious
    intrigues on such a cause of quarrel. I must admit that my methods were sometimes
    calculated to annoy; but I had no patience with the idiotic vanity of mediocrities. I took
    the Climbers' Record to be a serious complication and never wrote in it without the
    fullest sense of responsibility. So when I found a solemn Te Deum being chanted on account
    of the fifth ascent of the Pillar Rock by a &quot;lady&quot;, I took my dog to the top and
    recorded, &quot;First ascent by a St. Bernard bitch.&quot; When Jones, after the usual
    practice, had climbed Kern Knotts Crack, and three public school masters, who ought to
    have known better, said they had seen him do it, and it was a marvellous exhibition of
    skill and so on, I completed their remarks by a colophon: (Advt.) So much fuss was made
    about Kern Knotts Crack that Eckenstein took a young girl named Miss. Nicholls and asked
    her to lead up it, which she did.</p>
    <p>Wastdale at that time was a rendezvous for many amusing characters as well as for some
    of the most brilliant men in England. Professor Milnes Marshall spent most of his holidays
    there. His death is one of the most curious accidents in the history of climbing. He had
    gone up to Deep Ghyll with some friends one bright winter day when the mountains were
    covered with snow. But, not feeling particularly well, he remained at the foot of Deep
    Ghyll while his friends climbed it, proposing to take photographs of them. He set up his
    camera on a snow slope no steeper than Ludgate Hill, a place entirely free from danger.
    But he fell and rolled gently down the slope,</p>
    <p>{91}</p>
    <p>making no effort to save himself, finally pitching over a small cliff, at the foot of
    which he was picked up dead. It was not a climbing accident at all, any more than the
    death of Norman Neruda, who died of heart failure when he happened to be in a rock chimney
    in the Dolomites.</p>
    <p>After a short time at Tonbridge my health again broke down. It was evident that
    boarding-school life was unsuited to me. It was arranged for me to live at Eastbourne with
    a tutor named Lambert, a Plymouth Brother. It is curious (by the way) to reflect that
    Henry Bernstein, the celebrated French dramatist, being also a &quot;hope&quot; of the
    Brethren, was one of Lambert's pupils. I saw hardly anything of him. All I remember is
    that one day, for no reason that I can remember, we set to in the street and fought it
    out. At that time I knew no boxing. My one idea was to get his head &quot;in
    chancery&quot; under my left arm and bash his face in with my right, which I succeeded in
    doing, making no attempt to defend myself against his blows which he gave like a windmill
    on my skull. I remember acutely my surprise that they did not hurt me at all. During the
    day I worked at Eastbourne College in the chemical laboratory under Professor Hughes, and
    was privileged to assist that great man in several researches which go to prove that no
    two substances can combine in the absence of a third. It seems strange that I should have
    seen the bearings of this upon philosophy.</p>
    <p>One very significant incident is stamped upon my memory. I was spending an evening with
    the professor and in the course of some discussion I said, &quot;The Bible says so.&quot;
    These words dripped with the utmost irony from my lips. I meant to imply the bitterest
    contempt. I was not understood. He took me seriously and broke out into a passionate
    denunciation of the book. His manner was so ferocious that I was positively startled; and
    the interesting thing about the incident is this. I had been so long so alert lest I
    should be accused of disbelief, that it almost took my breath away to hear a man in
    authority speak so openly<strong>1</strong>. I have explained how I had vainly sought
    supreme wickedness in the Church of England. I had even gone to so-called &quot;high&quot;
    churches and on one occasion dared to enter the portals of the papists. But I had found
    nothing wicked even there. They all seemed to me to be tarred with the same brush; they
    were cold, heartless, dull, stupid, vapid and fatuous. The emotionalism of some and the
    sacramentalism of others seemed to me perfectly insincere. The fact is that (as my
    brother-in-law, Gerald Kelly, once told me, with astounding insight) I was the most
    religious man that he had ever met. It is the inmost truth. The instinct was masked for a
    long time, firstly by the abominations of the Plymouth Brethren and the Evangelicals;
    secondly, by the normal world. It only broke out at a subsequent period in any
    recognizable form. But when it</p>
    <p>{92}</p>
    <p>did so, it became the axis of my being. As a matter of fact, even in these early days,
    my real need was spiritual satisfaction; and I was a satanist or a worldling (as the case
    may be) in the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi.</p>
    <p>My poetry during this period was either amorous or satirical. A few of my efforts are
    preserved in <em>Oracles</em>. I quote the first and last verses from a lyric about a girl
    I met on the sea front.</p>
    <p align="center">ELVIRA</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Was thy fault to be too tender?<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">...</font>Was thine error to be weak?<br>
          Was my kiss the first offender<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">...</font>Pressed upon thy blushing cheek?</p>
          <p>Heaven at your accurst creation<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">...</font>Shall become a hell of fire:<br>
          Death for kisses, and damnation<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">...</font>For your love, shall God require!</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What is worthy of note is what I may call the <em>Laus veneris</em> point of view;
    which symbolizes my revolt and required many years to wear out. It seems as if I clung to
    the idea of the wickedness of love and the belief that it entailed divine retribution,
    partly perhaps because of my tendency to masochism, but consciously, at least, as adding
    actual value to sin. Pleasure as such has never attracted me. It must be spiced by moral
    satisfaction. I was reluctant to abandon my intellectual belief in Christianity; if the
    whole thing was nonsense, where was the fun of fighting it?</p>
    <p>All this early poetry, moreover, tended to become worse instead of better as my mind
    developed. I explain this by reference to the analogy of such games as billiards. As soon
    as one begins to take lessons one spoils one's natural game and one does not recover until
    the artificially acquired technique has been driven down into the subconscious by
    continual practice.</p>
    <p>Apart from a very few very early poems like &quot;The Balloon&quot;, all my writing is
    wooden, imitative and conscious, until I reached Cambridge, with hardly an exception.</p>
    <p>At Eastbourne, I had still no interest in games. I was still prevented from anything
    like intimate association with my fellow creatures. I was still ignorant of the existence
    of English literature and I became a first-rate French scholar without reading any French
    literature. In my play time I was either hunting flappers on the front, playing chess or
    climbing Beachy Head. My chess was almost entirely book learning and I was very mush
    surprised to find myself the best player in the town. For although the local champion
    insisted on giving me pawn and more, I beat him so easily every time I met him that the
    odds might have been reversed without making much difference</p>
    <p>{93}</p>
    <p>to the result. I edited a chess column in the <em>Eastbourne Gazette</em> and made
    myself a host of enemies by criticizing the team. I wanted to arose enthusiasm, to insist
    on study and practice and to make Eastbourne the strongest town in England. The result
    fell short of breaking up the club, but not very far.</p>
    <p>I used my position a editor to criticize the formation of the team and anything else
    that seemed to me wrong. I was absolutely unable to conceive that anyone should be
    anything but grateful for constructive criticism. I had moreover in my mind a firm
    conception of an editor as <em>Jupiter tonans</em>. I remember one occasion on which I
    made myself particularly nasty. In a club tournament I had won all my games except two
    against a man named Martin, who had failed to play any of his games. At the same time he
    would not withdraw from the tournament. I tried to deal with the situation in my weekly
    articles. I requested Mr. Martin to begin to play his games; I implored him to begin to
    play his games; I pointed out to him the propriety of beginning to play his games, I
    showed him that the best traditions of England (which had made her what she was) spoke
    with no uncertain voice to the effect that he should begin to play his games. All this
    settled down to a weekly chorus à la Cato, <em>Delenda est Carthago</em>. Whatever the
    subject of my discourse, it invariably ended, &quot;Mr. Martin has not yet begun to play
    his games.&quot;</p>
    <p>By this persistent nagging I got him to make an appointment with me and the game had to
    be adjourned in a position which was clearly won for me. He determined to avoid defeat by
    the simple process of refusing to make any further moves. I could have done a great deal
    with a brazier and a gimlet, but short of that there was no moving him; and his abstention
    prevented me from being proclaimed the winner. I published an analysis of the position,
    demonstrating that he was bound to lose and suggesting that he should either play it out
    or resign. But of course the result of my manoeuvres had simply been to drive him into
    blind fury and the situation was never settled. It simply lapsed by my departure for
    Switzerland.</p>
