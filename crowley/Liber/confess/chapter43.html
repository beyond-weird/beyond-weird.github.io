    <p>Any other man but myself would have made a ladder to fame out of the success of this
    winter. I had no such idea. I had been thoroughly disillusioned, not only by the original
    trance of sorrow which had struck me between wind and water in 1897, but by the experience
    of my travels. The natives of Hawaii were not worrying about Sophocles; Chogo Ri would be
    there when the last echo of Napoleon's glory had died away. I was more than ever convinced
    that to take an interest in the affairs of this world, one must turn one's back on truth.
    Buddhism might be right or wrong in saying that nothing is worth while; but anyhow there
    could be no doubt that the conventional standards of value were simply comic. If anything
    were worth while, it could only be discovered by turning one's back resolutely on temporal
    things.</p>
    <p>In accordance with Eckenstein's puritanical ideas of propriety, no communications about
    the expedition had been made to the newspapers. Ultimately, in the sheer interests of
    science, a paragraph had been permitted to appear in <em>The Times</em>. It contained
    thirty-two lines and seventeen misstatements of fact! I myself had been interviewed by a
    French journalist and the report of my remarks bore no discoverable relation with them. I
    am perhaps unduly sensitive about such stupidities. I ought perhaps to rely on time to
    sweep away the rubbish into the dustbin of oblivion and set the truth upon her throne; but
    yet, the evidence of history smiles grimly. What do we really know of the rights and
    wrongs of the struggle between Rome and Carthage! What do we know even of Buddhism and
    Christianity but that the most authentic accounts of their origins are intrinsically
    absurd! &quot;What is truth?&quot; said jesting Pilate. But, personally, I fail to see the
    joke.</p>
    <p>I went through life at this time with a kind of cynical bonhomie; nothing was really
    any particular good, so I might as well do what was expected of me. I wrote even of
    Buddhism with a certain detached disenchantment, as may be seen by reference to my <em>Summa
    Spes</em>, which I published separately (twelve copies contain the portrait of me by
    Haweis and Coles, subsequently reproduced in volume II of the vellum edition of my <em>Collected
    Works</em>) and sent to some of my friends in Paris on my departure for England.</p>
    <p>After Rodin, the most important of these friends was Marcel Schwob. Eugène Carrière I
    met only once. He had just recovered from an operation for cancer of the throat, and I
    remember principally his remark, calm to the point of casual indifference, &quot;if it
    comes back, I shall kill myself.&quot; Fritz</p>
    <p>{341}</p>
    <p>Thäulow I saw several times. He was rather a new type to me; a jolly, bearded senior
    on whom life had left no scars. He believed in his art and in his family; enjoyed
    everything, worried about nothing --- it was not at all one's idea of a great artist. I
    had already got it into my mind that the life of the artist must be a sequence of pungent
    pangs either of pleasure or pain; that his nature obliged him to regard commonplace
    circumstances rather as the average man regards deep sleep. But Thäulow lived every line
    of his life; he had somehow attained that supreme philosophy which contemplates all things
    alike with cheerful calm.</p>
    <p>Marcel Schwob excited my unbounded admiration. He was admittedly the finest French
    scholar of English. His style glittered with the superb simplicity and silken satire which
    compels me to regard Anatole France as his pupil. He had translated <em>Hamlet</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>
    for Sara Bernhardt with astonishing spiritual fidelity to the soul of Shakespeare. His <em>Vies
    Imaginaires</em> might have served as the model for <em>Le Puits de Sante Claire</em>, and
    his <em>Île des Diurnales</em> is as brilliantly bitter as anything that Swift ever
    wrote. He lived on the Ile St. Louis in a delightful flat, rich with the suggestion of the
    East (emphasized by a Chinese servant he had picked up after the exhibition of 1900), yet
    he suffered as few men suffer.</p>
    <p>Part of his crucifixion was rather ridiculous. It was suspected that he was more or
    less a Jew, and he was constantly aware that he did not enjoy the position in French
    literature to which his genius entitled him. His wife was one of the most beautiful women
    on whom I had ever laid eyes; an exquisite siren with a smile hat left La Gioconda
    standing, and a voice which would have burst the ropes that bound Ulysses to his mast. But
    she had been an actress, and this duchess and that countess did not call. It galled. The
    real tragedy of the man was that he was tortured by chronic constipation. It killed him
    soon after. Even after all these years I glow with boyish pleasure to recall his gracious,
    unassuming acquiescence in my impertinent existence and his acknowledgement of my <em>Alice,
    An Adultery</em> as a &quot;little masterpiece&quot;.</p>
    <p>My sonnet on Rodin begins &quot;Here is a man&quot;, which Marcel Schwob very properly
    translated, &quot;Un homme&quot;. I took the draft to Rodin's studio. One of the men
    present was highly indignant. &quot;Who is this Marcel Schwob,&quot; He exclaimed,
    &quot;to pretend to translate from this English? The veriest schoolboy would know that
    'here is a man' should be turned into 'Voici un homme'.&quot;</p>
    <p>This is the sort of thing one meets at every turn. The man was perfectly friendly, well
    educated and familiar with literature; yet he was capable of such supreme stupidity. The
    moral is that when an acknowledge master does something that seems at first sight
    peculiar, the proper attitude is one of reverent eagerness to understand the meaning of
    his action. This critic made as ass of himself by lack of imagination. He should have know
    that &quot;Voci un homme&quot; would have sprung instantly into Schwob's mind as the
    obvious</p>
    <p>{342}</p>
    <p>and adequate rendering. His rejection of it argues deep consideration; and the man
    might have learnt a valuable lesson by putting himself in Schwob's place, trying to follow
    the workings of his mind, and finally discovering the considerations which determine his
    judgment. I quote this case rather than grosser examples which I recall, because it is so
    simple and non-controversial, yet involves such important principles. Schwob's version
    stands before a background of the history of literature. It would be easy to write a long
    and interesting essay on the factors of the problem.</p>
    <p>Occasionally he came to see Kelly in his studio. His conversation was full of the most
    intensely interesting, because impersonally intimate, details about men of letters. He
    told us at first hand the tragedy of Meredith's life, the mystery of his birth, and his
    father's attempts to establish a marriage with would have entitled him to a place in the
    peerage; the romance of <em>Vittoria</em>; and the intrigue of <em>Diana of the Crossways</em>.
    He traced the influence of the master's locomotor ataxia upon his life, his character and
    his creatures. He explained how the long years of suffering had deformed Meredith's
    disposition and led him to disgrace himself by refusing to head the petition for Oscar
    Wilde's release.</p>
    <p>He told us the true story of <em>Salome</em>. The character of Wilde was simple. He was
    a perfectly normal man; but, like so many Irish, suffered from being a snob. In Dublin,
    Sir William Wilde was somebody in society; but when Oscar reached Oxford, he discovered
    that a medical knighthood, so far from being a distinction, was little better than a badge
    of servility. A family even of commoners could afford to sneer at his acceptance of a
    trumpery honour at the hands of a Hanoverian hausfrau. Wilde could not bear to be despised
    by brainless dukes, so he had sought hegemony in the hierarchy by the only means
    available, as a socially sensitive swineherd might aspire to the papacy. He determined to
    become the high priest of the cult which already conferred a kind of aristocracy upon the
    undergraduate, though it had not yet been organized and boosted. That was the result of
    his &quot;martyrdom&quot;, which accounts for most of the loathsome creatures that jostle
    one too frequently in 1929. &quot;The Law is a Hass&quot;!</p>
    <p>Wilde had denied his nature in the interests of social ambition, and the success of his
    scheme drove him to adopt every affectation as a sign of superiority. Outside the English
    system of caste, he might have been a contented cornchandler. Within it, he found himself
    obliged to affect to be sexually stirred by Maeterlinck, Flaubert, Gustave Moreau, and
    even the most sacred character of Scripture. He degraded the Sphinx by representing her as
    a sexual monster. He interpreted the relations between Christ and John, between Paul and
    Timothy, in the light of his own perverse imagination.</p>
    <p>When I say perverse, I do not mean to use the word in the psychopathic sense. Wilde's
    only perversity was that he was not true to himself. Without</p>
    <p>{343}</p>
    <p>knowing it, he had adopted the standards of the English middle class, and thought to
    become distinguished by the simple process of outraging them. As one is said to be able to
    invoke the devil by reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards, so Wilde thought to set up a new
    morality by reciting George R. Sims backwards. He naively accepted the cockney idea that
    Paris is a very wicked place, and proposed to petrify the puritans by writing a play in
    French. His difficulty was that his French was that of a schoolboy turned tourist; so he
    struggled to write <em>Salome</em> on the pretence that he was sexually excited by <em>The
    Temptation of St. Anthony</em>, Moreau's pictures in the Luxembourg and the style of <em>Pelléas
    and Mélisande</em>. But the performance was pitiful; and it was Marcel Schwob who
    re-wrote his puerile dialogue in French.</p>
    <p>At one of Marcel Schwob's afternoons I met Arnold
    Bennett</a>, very ill at ease to find himself in Paris in polite society. He must have had
    a perfectly lovely time; everything was alike a source of innocent wonder. He was very
    much pleased by the generous measure of respect which he received on all hands simply for
    being a novelist. His speech and his appearance attracted no insult from literary circles
    in Paris.</p>
    <p>At the time I had only read one of his books --- <em>The Grand Babylon Hotel</em>;
    Which I thought, and still think, somewhere near his high-water mark. I told him how much
    I admired it and was surprised to find that I had apparently said the wrong thing. But
    Kelly explained that he took himself seriously as a serious novelist, on the strength of
    having complied some books of reference on life in Shropshire or Straffordshire or some
    such place. I don't know which is which, thank God; I do not understand the system of
    classification of indexing, so I cannot turn up the symptoms of a dying Doultonware artist
    if I want to. But then I don't.</p>
    <p>Marcel Schwob gave me an introduction to William Ernest Henley, who invited me to lunch
    with him in his house near Woking. My sonnet on Rodin's bust of Henley describes the man
    and the interview rather than the sculpture.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Cloistered seclusion of the galleried pines<br>
        Is mine today; these groves are fit for Pan ---<br>
        O rich with Bacchus frenzy and his wine's<br>
        Atonement for the infinite woes of man!</p>
        <p>And here his mighty and reverend high priest<br>
        Bade me good cheer, an eager acolyte,<br>
        Poured the high wine, unveiled the mystic feast ...</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Roast lamb and an excellent Chablis which had been sent to him by Lord Northcliffe ---
    thus does the poet transfigure conceptions apparently commonplace.</p>
    <p>I was much touched by Henley's kindness in inviting me. I have never lost</p>
    <p>{344}</p>
    <p>the childlike humility which characterized all truly great men. Modesty is its parody.
    I had to wait some little while before he came down. When he did so, he was obviously
    suffering severe physical distress. Like Marcel Schwob himself, he was a martyr to
    constipation. He told me that the first half of every day was a long and painful struggle
    to overcome the devastating agony of his body. Only three weeks later he died. He was
    engaged in various tremendous literary tasks and yet he could give up a day to welcome a
    young and unknown writer!</p>
    <p>I could not pretend to myself that so great a man could feel any real interest in me.
    It never occurred to me that he might have read anything of mine and thought it promising.
    I took, and take, his action for sheer human kindness. I probably behaved with my usual
    gaucherie. The presence of anyone whom I really respect always awakes my congenital
    shyness, always overawes me. Henley's famous poem (which Frank Harris regards as &quot;the
    bombast of Antient Pistol&quot;) appealed intensely to my deepest feeling about man's
    place in the universe; that he is a Titan overwhelmed by the gods but not surrendering.
    And the form or the poem is superb. It is in line with all the great English expressions
    of the essential English spirit, a certain blindness, brutality and arrogance, no doubt,
    as in &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, &quot;Boadicea&quot;, &quot;The Garb of Old Gaul&quot;,
    &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot;, &quot;Toll for the
    Brave&quot;, &quot;Ye Mariners of England&quot;, <em>et hoc genus omne</em>; but with all
    that, indomitable courage to be, to do and to suffer as fate may demand.</p>
    <p>I never thought much of the rest of Henley's verse, distinguished as it is for vigour
    and depth of observation. It simply does not come within my definition of poetry, which is
    this: A poem is a series of words so arranged that the combination of meaning, rhythm and
    rime produces the definitely magical effect of exalting the soul to divine ecstasy. Edgar
    Allan Poe and Arthur Machen share this view. Henley's poem conforms with this criterion.</p>
    <p>I told him what I was doing about Rodin. His view was that the sonnet had been worked
    out and he advised me to try the Shakespearian sonnet or quatorzain. I immediately
    attempted the form in the train that evening and produced the quatorzain on himself from
    which I have quoted above. I recognized at once that the quatorzain was in fact much
    better suited to my rugged sincerity than the suavity of the Italian form, so I composed a
    number of poems in the new mode. In fact, I fell in love with it. I invented improvements
    by the introduction of anapaests wherever the storm of the metre might be maddened to
    typhoon by so doing, and it may be that history will yet say that <em>Clouds without Water</em>,
    a story told in quatorzains, as <em>Alice</em> in sonnets, is my supreme lyrical
    masterpiece.</p>
    <p>At least I have not died without the joy of knowing that no less a lover of literature
    than the world-famous Shakespearian Lecturer, Dr. Louis Umfraville Wilkinson, has dared to
    confess publicly that <em>Clouds without Water</em> is</p>
    <p>{345}</p>
    <p>&quot;the most tremendous and the most real love poem since Shakespeare's sonnets&quot;
    in the famous essay &quot;A Plea for Better Morals&quot;. But I anticipate. <em>Clouds
    without Water</em> came four years later. I am still sitting sleepily in the twilight in
    Europe; after my day's labour three years long in the blazing sun of the great world.</p>
    <p>I spent many of my evenings at a little restaurant called the Chat blanc in the rue
    d'Odessa, where was &quot;an upper room furnished&quot; and consecrated informally to a
    sort of international clique of writer, painters, sculptors, students and their friends.
    It has been described with accurate vigour in the introduction to <em>Snowdrops from a
    Curate's Garden</em>. I quote the passage.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>His evenings were spent in that witty and high-thinking informal club that met nightly
      at the restaurant Au Chien Rouge, whose members are so honoured in the world of art. There
      he met C--- the brilliant but debauched sculptor, caustic of wit, though genial to his
      friends; N---, the great painter, whose royal sense of light made his canvases into a
      harmonious dream: he also the sweet friend of Bacchus, who filled him with a glow and
      melody of colour and thought. There too, were D--- and L---, the one poet and philosopher,
      the other painter and --- I fear --- pederast. Twins in thought, the two were invincible
      in argument as they were supreme in their respective arts. Often have I sat, a privileged
      listener, while D---'s cold acumen and L---'s superb indignation, expressed in fiery
      swords of speech, would drive some luckless driveller from the room. Or at times they
      would hold down their victim, a bird fascinated by a snake, while they pitilessly exposed
      his follies to the delighted crowd. Again, a third, pompous and self-confident, would be
      led on by them, seemingly in full sympathy, to make an exhibition of himself, visible and
      hideous to all eyes but his own. L---, his eager face like a silver moon starting from a
      thundercloud, his hair, would pierce the very soul of the debate and kindle it with magick
      joy or freeze it with scorn implacable. D---, his expression noble and commanding, yet
      sly, as if ever ready to laugh at the intricacies of his own intellect, sat next him, his
      deep and wondrous eyes lit with strange light, while with words like burning flames of
      steel he shore asunder the sophistries of one and the complacencies of another. They were
      feared, these two! There also did he meet the well-known ethicist, I---, fair as a boy,
      with boy's gold locks curling about his Grecian head; I---, the pure and subtle-minded
      student, whose lively humour and sparkling sarcasm were as froth upon the deep and
      terrible waters of his polished irony. It was a pity that he drank. There the great
      surgeon and true gentleman, in spite of his exaggerated respect for the memory of Queen
      Victoria, J---, would join in with his ripe and generous</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{346}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>wit. Handsome as a god, with yet a spice of devil's laughter lurking there, he would
      sit and enjoy the treasures of the conversation, adding at the proper interval his own
      rich quota of scholarly jest.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, so brilliant a galaxy attracted all the false lights of the time.
      T---, the braggart, the mediocre painter, the lusty soi-disant maquereau of marchionesses,
      would seek admission (which was in theory denied to none). But the cutting wit of C---
      drove him headlong, as if by the cherubin, from the gates of the garden of Eden. G---, the
      famous society painter, came one night and was literally hounded out of the room by a
      swift and pitiless attack on the part of D--- and the young ethicist. A bullet-headed
      Yankee, rashly supporting him, shared the same fate and ever after sat in solitary
      disgrace downstairs, like a shipped hound outside its master's door. A fool reveals
      himself, though he talk but of greasing gimlets, in such a fierce light as beat upon the
      Chien Rouge. Nor could any fool live long in that light. It turned him inside out; it
      revealed him even to himself as a leper and an outcast; and he could not stand it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In such a circle humbug could not live. Men of high intellectual distinction, passing
      through Paris, were constant visitors at the Chien Rouge. As guests they were treated with
      high honour; but woe to the best of them if some chance word let fall led D--- or L--- to
      suspect that he had a weak spot somewhere. When this happened, nothing could save him: he
      was rent and cast to the carrion beasts for a prey.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How often have I seen some literary or pictorial Pentheus, impious and self-sufficient
      as he, disguise himself (with a tremor of fear) in his noblest artistic attire, as the
      foolish king in the <em>Bassara</em> of the Maenads!</p>
      <p>How often have I seen Dionysus --- or some god --- discover the cheat and give him over
      to those high priests of dialectic, D--- and L---, to be ravaged and stripped amid the
      gleeful shrieks of the wit- intoxicated crowd! But once the victim was upon the altar,
      once he rose from his chair, then what a silence fell! Frozen with the icy contempt of the
      assembly, the wretch would slink down the room with a sacred grin on his face, and not
      until he had faced that cruel ordeal, more terrible (even to a callous fool) than an
      actual whipping would have been, not until the door had closed behind him would the
      silence break as someone exclaimed &quot;My God, what a worm!&quot; and led the
      conversation to some more savoury subject.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>On the other hand there was B---, a popular painter, upon whom the whole Dog pounced as
      one man, to destroy him.</p>
      <p>But when they saw that his popular painting was not he, that he had a true heart and an
      honest ambition, how quickly were the swords beaten into absinthes and the spears into
      tournedos!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{347}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>S---, again, with a face like a portrait by Rembrandt, a man of no great intellect, but
      making no pretence thereto, how he was loved for his jolly humour, his broad smile, his
      inimitable stories! Yet it must not be suppose that the average man, however sincere, had
      much of a welcome there. Without intention to wound, he was yet hurt --- the arrows of wit
      shot over his head and he could never feel at home.</p>
      <p>I am perhaps the one exception. Without a ghost of talent, even in my own profession
      --- medicine --- I had no claim whatever to the hospitality of the Dog. But being
      perfectly unobtrusive, I dare say I was easy to tolerate, perhaps even of the same value
      as a background is to a picture, a mere patch of neutral colour, yet serving to harmonize
      the whole. Certainly nothing but my silence saved me. The remark a few pages back about
      Hall Caine and Meredith would have caused my instant execution, by the most painful, if
      the least prolonged, of deaths.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ay! no society, since men gathered together, was ever so easy to approach, to seat
      oneself among, to slip away from or to be hurled in derision from their midst!</p>
      <p>Dreaded as they were by the charlatan, no set of men could have been more genial, more
      fraternal. United by a bond of mutual respect, even where they differed --- of mutual
      respect, I say, by no means of mutual admiration, for it was the sincere artistry that
      they adored, not the technical skill of achievement --- they formed a noble and harmonious
      group, the like of which has perhaps never yet been seen<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another description may be found in the opening chapters of W. S. Maughams <em>The
    Magician</em>. The reader will wonder how this gentleman could have got there, but here my
    tale is tangled. Gerald Kelly's elder sister, Rose, had been for some years the widow of a
    Major Skerrett, and one of her best friends was a woman as beautiful and fascinating as
    herself, who was the wife of an English solicitor connected with the British Embassy,
    named Maugham. W. S. was this man's younger brother. Maugham claimed to have ambitions to
    become a man of letters and his incapacity was so obvious that I am afraid we were cruel
    enough to make him the butt of our wit when he visited the Cat Blanc.</p>
    <p>There is this excuse for us, that his earliest work was vamped over, his plagiarisms
    were beyond belief for impudence. When --- to parody the outburst of the heavy mother in
    Wilde's <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> --- he &quot;contracted an alliance with
    a tabloid and married into a pill-box&quot;, we thought that all was over. But no! he went
    around the world, and set to<ol>

    <p>work with his powers of observation to help an imagination which had by no become
    original and vigorous. He turned out some first-class work; and, what is in some ways
    better, work on the right side. He castigates the herd of many swine feeding which we call
    society --- as it is now late to drive their devils back into the Jews, where they are
    terrible congested.</p>
    <p>But in 1902 we were right to chivy him!</p>
    <p>It had leaked out that our luckless victim had taken a medical degree and J. W. Morrice<strong>1</strong>
    used to torment the poor fellow, whose distress was accentuated by his being a confirmed
    stammerer, by ringing the changes on this disgraceful episode of his career. Morrice was
    invariably mellow drunk all day and all night. He would look up from his crème de menthe
    and <em>oeufs sur le plat</em>, clear his throat and tell Maugham with grave importance
    that he would like to consult him on a matter concerning the welfare of art and artists.
    &quot;What would you do if ---&quot; and after repeating himself in a hundred ways so as
    to prolong the rigmarole to the utmost, he would wind up by confessing to the premonitory
    symptoms of some comic an repulsive malady. It was really needlessly cruel, for, bar his
    pretensions to literature, there is not an ounce of harm in Maugham, any more than there
    is in a packet of sterilized cotton wool. Even the pretence is after all a perfectly
    harmless affectation.</p>
    <p>But Maugham suffered terribly under the lash of universal contempt and did his best to
    revenge himself by drawing portraits, as unpleasant as petty spite could make them, of
    some of his tormentors. His literary method, when it transcends plain scissors and paste,
    is the shirt-cuff method of Arnold Bennett. I must thank him for recording some of my
    actual repartees. The man he most hated was Roderic O'Conor. This man was intimate with
    Gauguin, Van Gogh and Cézanne. In my opinion history will class him near them as a
    painter. I do not think he has many superiors in art alive today. But very few people have
    seen his pictures. His contempt for the world goes beyond that of Balzac and Baudelaire.
    He cannot be bothered to give a show. He will turn rudely from his door a friendly
    journalist bent on making him famous and rich. Also, he is a cad.</p>
    <p>To O'Conor, Maugham was not even funny. He was like a bed bug, on which a sensitive man
    refuses to stamp because of the smell and the squashiness. I have never felt thus. To me
    the least of human beings, nay, less than they, have a place in my heart. &quot;Everything
    that lives is holy.&quot; I can hardly bring myself to resent even the vilest and most
    offensive creatures. I have never been able to bear malice; I have never been able to
    understand how other people can do so. When I have been attacked, I have always looked at</p>

      <li><font size="2">This amiable and worthy colonist occupied a studio on the Quai des Grands
        Augustins (now, I suppose, called Quai Maréchal Fous-le-Camp), most conveniently situated
        over the apartment of an excellent midwofe: though I never heard that he had occasion to
        avail himself of her services.</font></li>

    <p>the matter impersonally. When I am publicly accused of stealing the towers of Notre
    Dame, I enjoy the joke thoroughly. I can't believe that anything can hurt me. It would
    hurt my pride to admit it, I suppose. When a newspaper prints three columns, identifying
    me with Jack the Ripper, it never occurs to me that anyone in his senses would believe
    such rubbish. I imagine that my integrity is universally patient as sunrise; I can't
    realize that I shall suffer in the estimation of anyone, or that (say) it will interfere
    with the sale of my books.</p>
    <p>I have never been able to analyse this mental attitude at all adequately, but part of
    it certainly derives from the fact that I have never lost my innocence. I sometimes wonder
    whether it may not prove a defect in my philosophical system that I am unable to believe
    in the existence of evil. There is of course the appearance of evil due to ignorance, bad
    judgment and so on; but my major premiss is &quot;Every man and every woman is a
    star.&quot;; and I always conceive the problem of progress as depending merely on
    enlightenment. I do not believe in original sin except in this sense that &quot;The word
    of Sin is Restriction.&quot;; and our normal conscious selves are inevitably restricted by
    the categories of space, time and causality, which are essential conditions of the
    manifestation of separate individualities. But I cannot get it into my head that any
    single human being can be really hostile to another. I regard all such passions as the
    symptoms of a definite deformity of nature produced by its inadequacy to deal with its
    environment. Just as a stick appears bent when thrust partly under water, so does a man's
    will apparently deviate when the refractive index of his environment deceives his vision.</p>
    <p>I do not know whether it is fair to say that I am callous, whether the long torture of
    my patient silent struggle against the tyrants of my boyhood case-hardened me against the
    world. I do not know how far the habit of concentration and the peculiar selective action
    of my memory has deadened my sensibilities, for I am as indifferent to most impressions as
    the holiest hermit could desire. I have become almost incapable of registering conscious
    impressions unless they pass the censor as having legitimate business with me. Of course a
    not dissimilar state of abstractedness is common enough in men whose lives are devoted to
    study, by the time they are fifty; but in me these tendencies were already bearing fruit
    long before I was thirty.</p>
    <p>The Montparnesse quarter was of course full of people who took their trumpery love
    affairs very seriously. But the English colony was riddled with English hypocrisy. I
    remember giving the manuscript of <em>Alice</em> to Kelly and a girl named Sybil Muggins<strong>1</strong>
    to read, and they agreed that no really nice woman would have kissed a man so early as the
    thirteenth day of his wooing. I must confess to having been taken a little aback,
    especially as Sybil Muggins was Haweis's mistress. A few days back, moreover, Haweis
    having gone to</p>
    <p>{350}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Query &quot;Meugins&quot;.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Brussels for a week, she switched over to Kelly. What dreadful days those were! They
    worked themselves up into such a state that Kelly actually proposed to marry Sybil, and
    his sister bustled over post haste to prevent it by threatening that his allowance would
    be stopped if he did anything so foolish.</p>
    <p>I had of course no sympathy whatever for the fatuity of the young people, but I have
    always felt with Shelley that parental tyranny is the most indefensible kind.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I was brought up in the other service; but I knew from the first that the Devil was my
      natural master and captain and friend. I saw that he was in the right, and that the world
      cringed to his conqueror only through fear. I prayed secretly to him; and he comforted me,
      and saved me from having my spirit broken in this house of children's tears. I promised
      him my soul, and swore an oath that I would stand up for him in this world and stand by
      him in the next. (<em>Solemnly</em>) That promise and that oath made a man of me. From
      this day this house is his home; and no child shall cry in it; this hearth is his altar;
      and no soul shall ever cower over it in the dark evenings and be afraid. (G.B.Shaw, <em>The
      Devil's Disciple</em>.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I offered to make Kelly an allowance equal to what he was receiving, which rather took
    the wind out of the sails of the old wooden three-deckers in Camberwell vicarage. The
    gesture was sufficient. The threat was withdrawn; Gerald on his side had cooled off
    sufficiently to see the folly of throwing himself away on a half-caste.</p>
    <p>To me the joke as obvious. I could already love without attachment so far as physical
    desire was concerned. There are one or two small errors in my subsequent life and they are
    due to my failure to extend this principle to other types of attachment. I have tried to
    set myself up against fate and save those who were predestined to be lost, to keep on
    trusting people after I knew perfectly well that they were false; and I have paid heavily
    for my chivalry and generosity. I still think these defects in some way preferable to
    sterner sense and virtue, and yet I know that I am wrong from every point of view. It does
    not do ultimate good to anyone concerned to shut one's eyes to the facts or to try to
    dodge one's creditors.</p>
