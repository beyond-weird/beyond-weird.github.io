    <p>Skardu, 2,228 metres above sea-level, is the capital of Baltistan, and contains some
    twenty thousand inhabitants. The mountains here seem to have conspired to stop suddenly so
    as to allow a large level plateau. The Indus spreads out almost as if to form a lake. The
    town is large and scattered; it is in fact less a town than a conglomeration of small
    farms. After our long and tedious march, we could enjoy to the full the sensation of the
    peace and beatitude which fill this smiling isolated valley.</p>
    <p>We stayed at the dak bagha, which stood some thirty yards back from a delicious stream
    of clear water. One evening, just after sunset, a young man appeared carrying on his
    shoulders his brother, who had been working in a quarry. A falling rock had struck the
    inside of the leg just below the knee and laid it open to the bone as far as the ankle.
    The doctor needed plenty of running water. So we took the patient down to the stream and
    hele Alpine lanterns while the doctor operated. The leg was in a shocking mess and we
    suggested chloroform. The doctor said &quot;No --- the boy will faint with the pain in a
    few seconds,&quot; and he went on washing out the dirt and snipping away loose pieces of
    flesh, and ultimately stitching up the whole fourteen inches of wound. The game went on
    for an hour and a half. But the boy never lost consciousness, and never moaned or so much
    as murmured. We heard nothing from him except a perfectly calm request, about half way
    through the job, for a drink of water.</p>
    <p>I did not content myself with admiring the lad's stoicism. His conduct made me suspect
    that the Mongolian (the Baltis are Mongols) as a very different nervous system from our
    own. I understood Chinese ideas of torture form this and similar facts, and began to
    correlate these physiological reactions with the psychology and philosophy of the race. It
    helped me to see that what we call ultimate truth is in reality no more than a statement
    of the internal relations of the universe which we perceive. One may say, indeed, that a
    unicellular organism would be absolutely justified in explaining the universe in terms of
    his own experience; that he could indeed by no possibility do anything else, and that the
    sole valid criticism which could be applied to his cosmology would be based on facts
    neither known nor knowable to him. Apply this argument to our actual ideas: any religion
    must rest of revelation and cannot be proved by reason or experience. It is at once
    necessary and impudent to claim the exercise of faith. From this it follows that religion
    must always be repugnant to reason and its upholders must be prepared to be called
    charlatans.</p>
    <p>{295}</p>
    <p>There is, however, one issue from this dilemma. It is possible to base a religion, not
    on theory and results, but on practice and methods. It is honest and hopeful to progress
    on admitted principles towards the development of each individual mind, and thus to
    advance towards the absolute by means of the consciously willed evolution of the faculty
    of apprehension. Such is in fact the idea underlying initiation. It constitutes the
    absolute justification of the Path of the Wise as indicated by the adepts, whether of the
    magical or mystical schools. For Yoga offers humanity an organ of intelligence superior to
    intellect, yet co-ordinate with it, and Magick serves to arose spiritual energies which
    while confirming those of the mind, bring them to their culmination.</p>
    <p>One afternoon was made notable by a storm of wind. Fine sand was blown up from the bed
    of the Indus to a height of over three thousand feet, completely obscuring the mountains.
    (I have seen something similar in Cumberland. One night a terrific storm broke over the
    west coast; of sufficient velocity to push a number of trucks from a siding into a London
    &amp; North Western train, wrecking it. The bough, as thick as my thigh, of a tree forty
    yards from the hotel was blown through my window on to the bed where I lay asleep, without
    waking me. In the morning the rain had stopped; but the wind continued with increased
    violence. Every stone wall in the neighbourhood had been thrown to the ground. The
    waterfalls exposed to the wind had been blown back so that the pitches over which they
    normally fell were practically dry. The water of the lake was swept up in vast clouds
    across the face of Scafell, completely hiding the mountain.)</p>
    <p>While making our new arrangements we lounged about, fished and climbed odd rocks which
    tempted us. On May 19th we crossed the Indus by ferry and followed a delightful road, for
    the most part level and wooded, to Shigar. The Shigar valley is strangely unlike that of
    the Indus and is out of keeping with one's natural ideas of mountain streams. The river
    winds through a broad flat wilderness of stones.</p>
    <p>The village of Shigar resembles and oasis in the Sahara, as I discovered some years
    later when I made my bow to the latter. There is indescribable fascination about these
    clusters of quiet houses in their groves of green; but there is a serpent in every Eden,
    and there was a missionary in Shigar. We asked to fool to dinner. He had been there seven
    years, as had also his predecessor, and between them they had not made a single convert.
    Christianity can never make any impression on a Mohammedan. The anthropomorphic and
    antropotheistic ideas connected with the Incarnation shock people whose conception of God,
    irrational though it be, is at least sublime. &quot;God hath neither equal, son, nor
    companion. Nothing shall stand before His face.&quot; The ethical implications of the
    Atonement are equally repulsive to the Moslem. As Ibsen said, &quot;Your God is an old man
    whom you cheat.&quot; Mohammedanism</p>
    <p>{296}</p>
    <p>teaches a man to respect himself; his relation with his supposed creator is direct; he
    cannot escape the penalty of his sins by paying the priest, or by persuading himself that
    everything has been arranged for him by a transaction of the most stupid injustice.
    Buddhism, in a totally different way, shares this conformity with common decency, and it
    is only the lowest caste of Hindu which really convinces itself that sacrifices and
    servility suffice for salvation. Where Islam and Christianity meet in open competition, as
    in some parts of Africa, it is found that only the lowest type of Negro, such as is
    accustomed to arrange matters with conscience by hanging a rag on a piece of stick,
    accepts Christianity. Anyone with a trace of self-respect disdains the lavish
    superstitions which we compel the Archbishop of Canterbury to subscribe, but can readily
    accept the simplicity of Islam as a stage beyond fetishism.</p>
    <p>The march from Shigar to Askole is extremely varied and beautiful. For three marches
    one ascends the Shigar valley. The river wasextraordinarily low, and could be crossed. In
    August 1892, Eckenstein,to cross one of the tributary streams --- of which though
    furnished with a rope, had been unable there must be more than one hundred. The
    explanationthat the snows had not begun to melt. is (of course) </p>
    <p>On one march we had to walk along the smooth round stones of the river bed for several
    miles. The track became impossible for horses. We crossed a pari (a buttress which juts
    into the stream and has to be climbed in consequence) over twelve hundred feet high. The
    next day we came to Ghomboro. The character of the country had completely changed once
    more. We had got back to the conditions of the valley of the Upper Indus. Ghomboro is a
    delightful village of apricot orchards. Below the terraces roars the water of the Bralduh
    Nala, a terrific torrent pent between narrow cliffs. The most striking impression of the
    entire journey is the variety of the physical geography. It is as if nature had conspired
    to afford one the maximum of new sensations. Nowhere else in the world have I observed
    such apparent discontinuity, such wealth of unexpected phenomena tumbling over each other
    to claim astonishment and admiration.</p>
    <p>There are no dak baghlas in these remote districts; so we were living in our tents. We
    dined in the open air under the apricots, while by our side one of the local elders exuded
    over five litres of serum. He had been carried down by his adherents in the last stages of
    dropsy; but after contributing his quota to the volume of the Bralduh, he walked
    cheerfully to his house without assistance, as he had not done for many months.</p>
    <p>Goitre is very common in this valley and I hoped to learn something about its etiology.
    As in the case of cancer, many attempt have been made to generalize from insufficient
    facts. One of the great arguments about goitre involves the Lötschenthal, where the
    people at the bottom of the valley could marry strangers from the Rhone valley, and those
    at the top go over</p>
    <p>{297}</p>
    <p>the Petersgrat and do their courting in Lauterbrunnen. Those in the middle were more
    inbred. It was accordingly observed that that goitre was more common among them. The
    Bralduh Nala completely upset any such theory, for while there was the same narrowness and
    isolation, the same limestone water and similar conditions all along, the goitre varies
    from village to village in an absolutely irregular way.</p>
    <p>The whole nala is full of interest. It is a regular showplace for the weirdest
    phenomena. About an hour and a half above Ghomboro is a tributary nala, with only a
    trickle of water but swept by intermittent flushes of mud. Its crossing presented a
    certain problem. I had to post a man to give warning when a torrent was on the way. I
    myself went down into the bed of the torrent, which was very steep and slimy, and hacked
    good steps for the coolies. If one had slipped, or been caught by a gush of mud, there
    would have been no saving him. It took about an hour and a half for the caravan to cross.
    Half an hour later, we came to a second obstacle of this sort, but it was very different
    in character. It was a level expanse of mud, very broad. The torrent had caked to a
    reasonable consistency under the banks, but there was a central section forty to fifty
    yards wide of very lively-moving stuff. The tehsildar of Skardu had sent up a gang of men
    to throw great stones into the stream for several days, for the mud moves very slowly. By
    this means, they had managed to make a sort of temporary bridge, the most quickly moving
    part of the stream in the centre being negotiated by the laying of a plank between stones.
    Our own men, of course, supplemented the efforts of their colleagues, each man bringing a
    stone as large as he could carry and dropping it into the most suitable place he could
    see. Having helped the men over the first torrent, I had automatically become rearguarded,
    and the bulk of the men had gone gaily over the second and more formidable obstacle when I
    arrived. They had got it into excellent condition and I strolled over as if it had been
    stepping stones across the Wharfe or the Lynn, and I was going to meet my girl!</p>
    <p>The next entertainment is a rope bridge. The &quot;ropes&quot; in question are composed
    of twigs. There are three main ropes, one to walk on and two to hold. The relations
    between the three are secured by a trellis of smaller twigs. They are a little terrifying
    at first sight, it is only fair to admit; but one cannot help thinking that Sir Martin
    Conway was almost too considerate of the nervousness of others when he insisted on roping
    Zurbriggen on one side of him an Bruce on the other before pirouetting lightly across.</p>
    <p>The day following, another rope bridge brought us back to the right bank of the
    Bralduh, where another phenomenon of astonishing beauty lay in wait. The extremely narrow
    gorge through which the Bralduh rushes for so many miles had suddenly broadened out. We
    were in a wide smiling valley ringed with mountains which, gigantic as they were, seemed
    to confess by</p>
    <p>{298}</p>
    <p>the comparative mediocrity of their structure that they were second rate. The valley is
    wholly bare of verdure except for plantations, as throughout Baltistan. The first thing to
    meet our eyes was what, suppose we had landed in the country of Brobdignag, only more, so,
    might have been the lace handkerchief of a Super-Glumdalclitch left out to dry. It was a
    glittering veil of brilliance of the hillside; but closer inspection, instead of
    destroying the illusion, made one exclaim with increased enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>The curtain had been formed by crystalline deposits from a hot spring (38.3°
    centigrade<strong>1</strong>). The incrustation is exquisitely white and exquisitely
    geometrical in every detail. The incrustation is exquisitely white and exquisitely
    geometrical in every detail. The burden of the cynicism of my six and twenty years fell
    from me like a dream. I trod the shining slopes; they rustled under my feet rather as snow
    does in certain conditions. (The sound is strangely exhilarating.) It is a voluptuous
    flattery like the murmurous applause of a refined multitude, with the instinctive ecstatic
    reverence of a man conscious of his unworthiness entering paradise. At the top of the
    curtain is the basin from which it proceeds, the largest of several similar formations. It
    is some thirty-one feet in diameter, an almost perfect circle. The depth in the middle is
    little over two feet. It is a bath for Venus herself.</p>
    <p>I had to summon my consciousness of godhead before venturing to invade it. The water
    streams delicately with sulphurous emanations, yet the odour is subtly delicious. Knowles,
    the doctor and I spent more than an hour and a half reposing in its velvet warmth, in the
    intoxicating dry mountain air, caressed by the splendour of the sun. I experienced all the
    ecstasy of the pilgrim who has come to the end of his hardships. I felt as if I had been
    washed clean of all the fatigues of the journey. In point of fact, I had arrived, despite
    myself, at perfect physical condition. I had realized from the first that the proper
    preparation for a journey of this sort is to get as fat as possible before starting, and
    stay as fat as possible as long as possible. I was now in the condition in which Pfannl
    had been at Srinagar. I could have gone forty-eight hours without turning a hair.</p>
    <p>Pfannl himself was still in excellent form, but he had used up a lot of his reserve
    force, though he showed no signs of having done so. He was thirty-one and should have
    possessed much more endurance than I. People in general have very erroneous ideas about
    age. For rock climbing or lyric poetry one is doubtless best in one's twenties. For a
    Himalayan expedition or dramatic composition, it is better to be forty than thirty.
    Eckenstein at forty-three, despite his congenital tendency to respiratory troubles, was by
    no means too old; and Knowles, twenty years younger, was emphatically too young.
    Guillarmod, at thirty-three, and Wessley, at thirty-one suffered less than any of us.</p>
    <p>In Wessely's case this was mostly because he had no imagination enough to be ill. None
    of us had ever seen such a perfect pig. He was very greedy and</p>
    <p>{299}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: 100.7 Degrees F.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>very myopic. In order to eat, he would bend his head over his plate and, using his
    knife and fork like the blades of a paddle wheel, would churn the food into his mouth with
    a rapid rotatory motion. There was always some going up, and always some going down, until
    he deposited his well-sucked instruments of nutrition on a perfectly clean plate and asked
    for more. It was the most disgusting sight that I have ever seen. Explorers are not
    squeamish; but we had to turn our heads away when Wessely started to eat. I admit and
    deplore my human weakness. All forms of genius should be admired and studied, and Wessely
    was a world's champion.</p>
    <p>My first experience of gluttony was at Tonbridge. One of my best friends was the fat
    boy of the house. (He was a nephew of the Adams who discovered Neptune.) One day he was
    sent two pounds and proceeded to the tuck-shop, where one could buy a very generously
    estimated ice-cream for sixpence. We thought to share in the bounty; but Adams said no
    with truly Roman fortitude and tortured us by consuming the whole four score icecreams
    himself.</p>
    <p>At Cambridge one of my most intimate friends was a man named Parez of Emmanuel, and in
    him I recognized a supreme trencherman. One Saturday I had been held up at Hitchin, my
    racing roadster having sprung a leak. I got back to Cambridge too late to order brunch
    from the kitchens, so on Sunday morning there was nothing for it but to go round to Parez
    and see if he could feed me. To my joy, I found him reading and smoking by the side of a
    table spread with a brunch for six, conceived in a spirit of gargantuan hospitality. I
    invited myself, of course; but to my surprise Parez declined, saying that there was hardly
    enough for the party as it was. &quot;Hang it,&quot; said I, &quot;for God's sake let me
    stay; perhaps one of them won't turn up.&quot; My host agreed, remarking that the
    born-out-of-wedlock offenders against the Criminal Law Amendment Act were late. After a
    couple of games of chess, something reminded him that he had forgotten to send out any
    invitations! We finished that brunch and I swear to God I didn't eat more than one and a
    half or one and three quarters myself.</p>
    <p>Later I asked him to dinner in London. He began with two large fried soles to his own
    cheek, and went on with a porterhouse steak. I forget the rest. But, compared with
    Wessely, he was a Succi! When Wessely reached Rodokass on the return journey, the servants
    asked permission to celebrate by killing two sheep of the flock which we had taken there;
    they would, or course, cook the best parts of the meat for the sahibs. Pfannl could eat
    nothing, and Guillarmod very little, but in a short time the servants repeated their
    request. Wessely had devoured practically the whole two sheep. Of course the mountain
    variety is not a Southdown. It probably does not weigh more than the average four months
    lamb in Sussex. But even so Wessely's exploit is pretty good.</p>
    <p>{300}</p>
    <p>On my own arrival at Rodkass, I mad rather a beast of myself. I had been starving on
    canned food for nearly two months, and that half-warm, half-cooked fresh mutton made me
    practically insane. I was suffering the agonies of sugar starvation plus the effects of a
    recurrence of malaria, so that vomiting and diarrhoea were continuous. But never in my
    whole life have I tasted anything like that mutton. I gorged myself to the gullet, was
    violently sick and ordered a fresh dinner.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>There's yet some mutton left.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I may mention in this place that experience has convinced me of the truth of the Hindu
    theories about Prana. Apart from the chemical and physiological transactions involved in
    eating, one is nourished directly, but what one must call, however one may hate to do so,
    the vital principle in food. We had already found on Iztaccihuatl that canned food ten
    years old failed to nourish anything like as well as stuff recently tinned. We derived
    much more energy from fresh-killed mutton, cooked before rigor mortis had set in, than
    from ordinary butcher's meat. I ultimately learnt that I could make myself actually drunk
    on half a dozen oysters chewed in the manner of the yogis.</p>
    <p>One of the practices of Hatha Yoga consists in learning to reverse the peristaltic
    action of the alimentary canal at will, so that one can make oneself sick quietly without
    spasmodic action. What they do is to swallow a number of yards of tarband and eject it
    again by training the necessary muscles. They then apply these principles to their rice
    and, after allowing it to remain in the stomach for a short time, quietly reject it. This
    rice, though unchanged in appearance, contains no nourishment, so that a dog who ate it
    would starve. The object of the yogi is to relieve his body of the responsibility of
    dealing with the elements of the food which do not contribute to sustenance. One is forced
    to suspect the existence of some subtle principle attached to organic substances which
    gradually disappears after death, rapidly at first, and then with increasing slowness, so
    that the process is not complete perhaps for years. It is like the elimination of
    impurities from alcohol, the first distillation gets rid of most of them, but there is a
    residuum carried over which requires repeated fractionation<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>{301}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Aside from a caution against bulimia in this question, there is
        an observation to make. Crowley speculated elsewhere that the human spirit might attach to
        the body after death in just such a manner as the vital principle in food. This led him to
        recommend cremation as a remedy for prolonged post- mortum agony.</font></li>
