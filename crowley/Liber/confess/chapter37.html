    <p>From the hot spring one goes gently along the valley to Askole. The whole march is
    short, easy and delightful. It only occupied five hours, of which at least three were
    spent at the rope bridge and in the pool.</p>
    <p>The entire journey had been extraordinarily favourable. We had had very little bad
    weather, the coolies had behaved admirably, there had been no accidents and no sickness,
    except for my own dermatological trouble. At Askole, however, several of the servants were
    slightly indisposed for a couple of days.</p>
    <p>We spent ten days in this village. Beyond this point there are no supplies of any sort.
    It was therefore necessary to establish a depot of food for the men higher up. The
    difficulty in travelling in uninhabited countries is that a man who eats (say) two pounds
    a day and carries sixty pounds can carry nothing except his own food on a journey of
    thirty marches. Our problem was how to get about one hundred and ten loads deposited at a
    distance representing (there and back) not less than twenty marches. We bought every pound
    of everything eatable in the valley and employed every man available. This meant (roughly)
    three men to carry one load, one for the load itself, the other two for the food of the
    three. Even with the advance depots, the task strained the resources of the valley.</p>
    <p>There was one trifling conflict of opinion between myself and Eckenstein at Askole. It
    was arranged that our valises should not exceed forty pounds on the glacier, though many
    of the loads exceeded fifty. I could not get my belongings within the limit. Eckenstein
    wanted me to leave behind my library. His theory of travelling in wild countries was that
    one should temporarily become an absolute savage; but my experience had already shown me
    that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
    of God. I attributed the almost universal mental and moral instability of Europeans
    engaged in exploring to their lack of proper intellectual relaxation far more than to any
    irritations and hardships inseparable from physical conditions. Conrad's &quot;An Outpost
    of Progress&quot; and Kipling's story of the lighthouse keeper who went mad are
    outstanding examples of the psychological processes which are likely to occur. Perfectly
    good friends become ready to kill each other over a lump of sugar. I won't say that I
    couldn't have stood the Baltoro glacier in the absence of Milton and the rest; but it is
    at least the case that Pfannl went actually mad, that Wessely brooded on food to the point
    of stealing it, and</p>
    <p>{302}</p>
    <p>that Eckenstein and Knowles<strong>1</strong> both lost their heads over the cholera
    scare! Thus the only man beside myself to retain perfect mental balance was the doctor,
    who kept his mind constantly occupied by observations in natural history, photography,
    writing articles for the Swiss newspapers, keeping an elaborate journal for the purposes
    of his book on the expedition, and spending the rest of his spare time in playing chess
    with me.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein made himself quite unpleasant to me, which was utterly out of his character;
    and, by itself, evidence of the strain on his temper caused by the Austrian idiocies and
    vanities. I wasted no words. I merely shrugged my shoulders and said: either I took my
    books with me or I left the expedition. Needless to say, I carried my point. It may strike
    some people that I was a little <em>outre-cuidant</em> about it; but I take matters like
    this very seriously. I would rather bear physical starvation than intellectual starvation,
    any day of the week. It is one of the most frightful consequences of increasing age that
    one finds fewer and fewer of one's contemporaries worth talking to. One is forced more and
    more to seek society either with the great masters of the past or with discarnate
    intelligences.</p>
    <p>Pfannl and Wessely had become rather a nuisance. They complained of Eckenstein's
    discipline and made themselves notably unpleasant. We rather encouraged them to go off all
    day and make heroic ascents. But their proposal to take three days' provisions in their
    rucksacks and go off and climb K2 was negatived. It is really astonishing that so many
    days of travel had taught them nothing about the scale of the mountains. One cannot
    measure them by feet and miles. I myself cannot quite see how it is that the difference
    comes in. But there is not doubt of the fact. It is quite useless to talk of climbing a
    mountain whose summit is five thousand feet above the starting point, as one could do if
    one were in the Alps. For one thing, however perfect may be one's physical condition, the
    effect of marching day after day is to make it somehow impossible to make an extra effort.
    I suppose it is the difference between the hundred yards and the three miles at Queens.
    But apart from this, there seems to be some subtle factor which determines the limit of
    the day's work. But if I could not explain, at least I thoroughly appreciated, the
    conditions.</p>
    <p>Another difficulty made it clear that the foreigners in the expedition were simply dead
    weight. Knowles himself, docile, cheerful and phlegmatic, could not give much active
    assistance. In view of the character of the glacier, the party could no longer travel as a
    unit after leaving terra firma. Only Eckenstein and I spoke Hindustani; only Eckenstein or
    I could be trusted to lead. The Austrians were always making heroic gestures, and
    Guillarmod finally demonstrated his incapacity by wandering out one day and getting</p>
    <p>{303}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">The latter under the powerful influence of the Chief --- otherwise he
        would not have turned a hair. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>crag-fast in a perfectly easy place. His misadventure would have been a blow to our
    prestige had not the natives already accepted him as Tartarin. Our arrangements were
    therefore settled for us by circumstances. Eckenstein's power of organization was unique.
    There was no choice but to leave him at Paiyu to dispatch relays of food. I was thus the
    only possible leader, and I had to go alone because the Austrians were inseparable, and it
    was better for Knowles and the doctor to be as near Eckenstein as possible. We accordingly
    started in four sections; I, with a picked body of coolies, the Austrians a day later,
    Knowles, and the doctor twenty-four hours behind him, and Eckenstein as soon as I had
    carried our my objective of reconnoitring the mountain and establishing a main camp at its
    foot. I could not but feel that Eckenstein had shown bad judgment in collecting so
    unwieldy a party. I believe to this day that if he, I and Knowles had been alone, we
    should have diminished our difficulties by sixty per cent, and perhaps walked up the
    mountain before the weather broke.</p>
    <p>Thanks to our rapid march from Srinagar, we were a fortnight ahead of our programme. We
    were afraid of getting to the mountain too early in the season; but from what I now know
    of the climate, we should have done much better to rush through and tackle the mountain
    before the breaking of the monsoon in India.</p>
    <p>Another ill effect of including the foreign element was this. Eckenstein, somewhat
    forgetful of the principles of selfless concentration which are essential to the
    performance of any Great Work, made a point of admitting the existence of the possibility
    on international jealousy. He therefore forbade me to cross the Bergschrund before the
    whole party had arrived at the main camp, which it was my business to establish at the
    foot of the mountain proper. I wish I had remembered about Nelson's blind eye. When I
    arrived at Camp 10 on the level glacier above the ice fall underneath the south-eastern
    slopes of Chogo Ri, I could have gone on without any difficulty up those slopes to the
    well-marked shoulder immediately beneath the final pyramid, and had I done so, I have no
    doubt whatever that we could have made a successful dash for the summit.</p>
    <p>I started on June 5th for Korophon, going as slowly as I could. The march occupied over
    forty-eight hours. The march crosses the Biafo glacier; and there I had my first real
    taste of certain conditions peculiar to the Himalayas. There is a violent alternation of
    heat and cold between night and day. The maximum shade temperature, rarely less than 25°
    centigrade, often touched 30° and sometimes climbed close to 40°, whereas the minimum
    was hardly ever above zero, even at Askole, and on the glacier reached anything from -10°
    to -30°. The result is that a few minutes of sunshine produces revolutionary results. A
    thick hard crust of snow disappears almost instantaneously and leaves one floundering in a
    mass of seething crystals. Rocks perched on</p>
    <p>{304}</p>
    <p>ice become very hot in an incredibly short time and break loose from the ice on which
    they are poised in a way which takes men of merely Alpine experience by surprise. My
    Mexican expedition proved invaluable in enabling me to foresee these phenomena. But the
    first warning was given on this march when two enormous stones which, anywhere else, would
    have stayed where they were for years, fell about twenty yards in front of me and the
    advance guard!</p>
    <p>When I say Korophon, it must not be imagined that it means anything more than a mark on
    the map. It is distinguishable only by a cubical block of granite about twenty feet high,
    under the two overhanging sides of which a little wall has bee built by the shepherds who
    occasionally lead their flocks so far afield. One wonders why; for even at Korophon itself
    the vegetation is extremely sparse and scrubby.</p>
    <p>The next day I went on to Bardumal at the foot of the spur. There are actually a few
    trees at this place. On this march one has to cross the Punmah, a broad and shallow stream
    which I found easy enough to ford. The alternative --- to which we were reduced on our
    return --- is to trudge about six miles up stream to a rope bridge and down the other
    bank. It may be that the low barometric pressure affects the velocity of running water,
    for streams seem much swifter than one would expect for the slope. The current carries
    down round stones in the most dangerous way. When Knowles tried to ford this river on the
    way back, though the water was barely kneedeep, he was swept away at once, and would have
    been drowned or battered to death in a few seconds if he had not been promptly pulled back
    by the rope which he had prudently put on. As it was, he received two violent blows from
    stones, one of which nearly snapped his thigh and the other his spine. On looking at the
    photographs of this stream, it seems positively ridiculous to associate the slightest
    danger with crossing them.</p>
    <p>The following day we went on to Paiyu, a dreary march of some five hours, enlivened
    only by the feelings that we were getting somewhere. The narrowness of the valleys and the
    steepness of the spurs of the great range prevent one getting any view of the high peaks.
    On this day's march we had our first glimpse of a giant, the Mustagh Tower, and the
    sublimity of the sight made up for the monotony of the march.</p>
    <p>There are many phenomena of extraordinary interest, had we not been surfeited with
    things stupendous and strange. At one part of this journey, we were literally walking for
    hours on garnets. Another marvel is a range of stratified eruptive rocks which stand out
    brilliantly black against the greys and browns of the background. Near Paiyu there is a
    regular range of mountains composed of consolidated glacial mud. Again, there is a row of
    pinnacles capped by enormous boulders on the principle of glacier tables.</p>
    <p>{305}</p>
    <p>They have been weathered into slender tapering cones; the stone at the top has
    protected them from being washed down evenly.</p>
    <p>Paiyu is an open plateau boasting at least three trees. We were to remain a day here to
    build a stone house to protect our supplies and to do the repacking necessary for my
    advance guard.</p>
    <p>In the course of this work, the trouble with our Pathan servants came to a head. We had
    had several complaints of their arrogance and overbearing behaviour towards the natives,
    and now we found that they had stolen some fowls from our travelling farmyard, which
    included, by the way, fifteen sheep and thirty goats. We also discovered that they had
    stolen and sold practically the whole of our reserve sugar. There was nothing to do but to
    sack them, which we did.</p>
    <p>Out of this arise an incident which I shall always remember with peculiar delight. I
    was able to play Haroun al-Rashid and administer poetic oriental justice. We had furnished
    the malefactors with magnificent new coats for the journey. One of the men, not content
    with this, had bullied and cheated one of the Kashmiri servants out of his torn rags, and
    insisted on disrobing his victim that he might bear away the spoils on his departure. To
    all intents and purposes, the man was left with nothing to wear. He complained to me. I
    heard the case with grave attention; I had to admit that by native justice the clothes
    belonged to the marauder, who grinned and triumphed and redoubled his insults to his
    discomfited dupe. &quot;But wait,&quot; said I. &quot;Hassan's coat certainly belongs to
    you, but the coat <em>you</em> are wearing belongs to <em>me</em>! So I made him take it
    off and clothed the unfortunate Hassan in its splendours, while the villain of the piece
    had to go off down the valley (where a nice prison was waiting for him) clad in the
    wretched rags, much too small for him, amid the joy of the entire caravan at seeing the
    biter bit.</p>
    <p>This episode is very instructive. One of the best ways of endearing oneself to the
    Eastern mind is to show ingenuity in doing essential justice in accordance with legal
    formality. The instinct which makes us sympathize with Ars&#138;ne Lupin, Raffles and Co.
    is universal. Unfortunately, in the West, we have lost the idea of the just despot. Our
    judges seem to derive cynical amusement from contemplating the absurdities and
    abominations which result from formal fidelity to the law. We have lost sight of the fact
    that law is essentially no more than a generalized statement of prevailing customs. This
    is so true that it is fair to say that abstract ideas of justice have little to do with
    primitive legislation; the idea is only to enforce compliance with current conventions.</p>
    <p>But nowadays, legislation has broken its banks. It has become a thing in itself and has
    arrogated to itself the right of revolutionizing the habits of the people in utter
    indifference to their wishes, but in accordance with abstract ideals which take no account
    of existing conditions. &quot;Prohibition&quot;</p>
    <p>{306}</p>
    <p>is of course the most outrageous example of this inhuman tyranny. But all such
    aberrations from common sense defeat themselves in the long run. The law of Moses was
    entirely intelligible to the least of the Children of Israel; but today not even the
    greatest judges can pretend to know what the law is until the case at issue has been
    thrashed out and the decision established as a precedent.</p>
    <p>The most honest man cannot always be sure that he is not violating some statute. This
    is even more appallingly and Gilbertainly true in the United States, where federal laws,
    state laws, municipal laws and police regulations clash their contradictory complexities
    at ever turn. &quot;Ignorance of the law excuses no man.&quot; But it leads him to take
    his chance of peril which he cannot but ignore, and thus the law falls into disrespect and
    ultimately into desuetude. In the meantime, small gangs take advantage of their special
    knowledge to blackmail certain sections of the community by technical persecution. We see
    the censorship, the licensing laws, the inland revenue laws, and even certain commercial
    and criminal laws arbitrarily invoked against people who have no idea that they are doing
    wrong in doing exactly as their neighbours do.</p>
