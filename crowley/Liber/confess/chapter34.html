    <p align="center"><em>Agreement between Oscar Eckenstein and Aleister Crowley</em></p>
    <p>1. By O.E.'s letter of Sept. 20th and cable of Oct. 3rd he agrees to A.C.'s proposal by
    cable and letter of August 23rd that they should together climb a mountain higher than any
    previously ascended by man: both agree to use their utmost endeavours in every respect to
    achieve this result.</p>
    <p>(On August 23rd A.C. placed five hundred pounds at the disposal of O.E.; on Oct. 10th
    he added another five hundred pounds in case of emergency, for this purpose. O.E. is
    empowered to employ part of this latter sum, or all if absolutely necessary, to arrange by
    insurance for Dr. Karl Blodig to join us. It is, however, understood that Dr. Blodig's
    status as an amateur shall be rigidly respected.)</p>
    <p>2. This agreement only to be cancelled by death, serious illness or vital affairs of
    one of the parties.</p>
    <p>3. O.E. agrees to take all responsibility of preparing the expedition in England, to
    have authority to accept a third or fourth member of the party, should such a one be
    willing to pay his full share of the expenses, and he shall be responsible for the safe
    arrival of the party and baggage in place and date provided by him.</p>
    <p>4. On accomplishment of (3) &quot;the leader&quot; will then assume entire control of,
    and responsibility for, the expedition, until the return of the party to civilization.
    &quot;The leader&quot; shall be either O.E. or A.C., as they may subsequently agree, and
    no other person.</p>
    <p>&quot;The leader&quot; must give his orders in writing if requested. (N.B. This should
    always be done if separation of the party is involved.) &quot;The leader&quot; shall have
    the right to consult any member of the party, who must consider his difficulty with
    judicial care, and return a serious answer, in writing if requested. Should any dispute
    arise, a council may be called to sit under parliamentary usage, &quot;the leader&quot; to
    be chairman, unless his own conduct be in question. In the latter case, a chairman to be
    selected. A majority vote to decide. &quot;The leader&quot; to have a casting vote in case
    of equality. &quot;The leader's&quot; orders shall be otherwise without appeal, and shall
    be obeyed cheerfully and to the best of ability: except that no member of the party is to
    be obliged anywhere to risk his life, how own judgment to be the arbiter as to</p>
    <p>{278}</p>
    <p>whether such and such an order involves danger, whether from men, starvation, animals
    or other causes.</p>
    <p>5. All members of the party pledge themselves to have nothing whatever to do with women
    in any way that is possibly avoidable: not to interfere in any way whatever with native
    prejudices and beliefs.</p>
    <p>This clause shall take effect from the accomplishment of (3).</p>
    <p>6. Any dispute arising under this agreement shall be subjected to arbitration in the
    usual way and shall not be subject to appeal at law or otherwise.</p>
    <p>7. Should a third, fourth or fifth man join the party, he shall sign this agreement
    before he is definitely accepted.</p>
    <p align="center">Witness our hands.</p>
    <p>At Kandy, Oct. 12th, 1901.</p>
    <p>The expedition was composed of six members. Thanks to the Alpine Club, there was no
    Englishman of mountaineering ability and experience available. We had, however, a Trinity
    man named Knowles, aged twenty-two, which is far too young for work of this kind, which
    requires endurance. He knew practically nothing of mountains, but he had common sense
    enough to do what Eckenstein told him; and as it was, he proved invaluable in Srinagar and
    even on the actual journey. He was a source rather of strength than of weakness. Then
    there was an Austrian judge named Pfannl, reputed the best rock climber in Austria, and
    his regular climbing companion Wessely. They had no experience beyond the Alps and proved
    utterly unable to make allowances for the difference of scale. Pfannl was also obsessed
    with the idea of getting into athletic condition and had begun to train directly he
    stepped on the boat at Trieste. Foreseeing trouble, I kept part of my diary in a magical
    cipher. I find an entry dated March 31st, 1902:</p>
    <p>This is called the Misadventure of Pfannl.<br>
    Mountain Sigma. On the Finsteraarhorn after traversing Schreckhorn directly from R.R.
    journey, Pfannl had to be carried down from the Concordia but. Again, on the Géant, he
    collapsed from food, etc. The whole moral of this is: &quot;If Pfannl collapses, it will
    be complete. He is sure to overtrain.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Austrians were totally unable to understand the workings of the native mind, as
    appeared very soon. It was a great mistake to bring them. The sixth member of the party
    was a Swiss ex-Army doctor named Guillarmod, who looked and behaved like Tartarin de
    Tarascon. He knew as little of mountains as he did of medicine, and proved a great source
    of</p>
    <p>{279}</p>
    <p>weakness, though his delightful geniality helped both the psychology of the party and
    our relations with the natives. He was our comic relief and did much to make things more
    tolerable for all of us. For all that, I think we should have done better to take none of
    the foreigners<strong>1</strong>. Our numbers made us unwieldy; and the question of
    international jealousy contributed indirectly to our failure, as will be explained later.</p>
    <p>We left Pindi for Tret on the twenty-ninth of March. We had had to repack our baggage,
    which weighted over three tons, for convenience of transport by ekkas. These are
    contraptions which suggest a hansom cab with the back knocked out and the driver on the
    floor, as it might have been conceived by the man who invented the coracle. Even one
    European finds it impossible to get a comfortable seat or stretch his legs, and a second
    constitutes outrageous overcrowding. A party of eight to ten natives, on the other hand,
    finds itself at ease.</p>
    <p>Our adventures began with startling suddenness. I woke up in the dak bungalow at Tret
    the next morning to find a dignified young gentleman sitting at my bedside. I wondered if
    I had been ill without knowing it, for his face expressed the sympathetic concern of Luke
    Fildes' &quot;doctor&quot;. Not at all; he was a police inspector who had arrived by
    tonga, a two-horse rattletrap which is used by pe&amp;127ple in what passes for a hurry in
    these parts of the world. All he knew was that we mustn't start --- &quot;his not to
    reason why&quot;. I said he had better talk to the leader of the expedition, Mr.
    Eckenstein. He assumed an awed expression, as if I had said something not quite nice.
    Knowles and I, who were sharing the same room, proceeded to dress with elegant leisure and
    bore our bewilderment to Eckenstein.</p>
    <p>At this point a telegram arrived, from which we inferred that the Indian Empire was
    somewhat imperilled by our conduct. At ten o'clock there arrived no less a person than the
    deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi; one of those strong silent men, with whom Mr. Henry
    Seton Merriman has made us familiar. He summoned me to his august presence. I (obviously)
    referred him once more to Eckenstein, but he jibbed --- his orders were that the rest of
    us could do as we liked; but Eckenstein would not be allowed to enter Kashmir. We asked
    why. At this time <em>The Book of the Law</em> not having yet been given to mankind, he
    was unable to reply, &quot;Enough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!&quot;<strong>2</strong>;
    but we understood him as uttering &quot;words to that effect&quot; in his strong silent
    way. We finally induced him to face Eckenstein; who, with his usual aplomb, put the poor
    man into a dilemma at once. He wanted to know whether he was or was not arrested.
    &quot;Heaven forbid,&quot; said the D.C., &quot;that any such idea should enter my pure
    mind.&quot; &quot;All right then,&quot; said Eckenstein; &quot;I shall go on.&quot; Oh no
    --- the orders were</p>
    <p>{280}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">This was done in stark violation of clause3. Knowles and I paid the whole
        expenses of these undesirable aliens.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: AL II, 33.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>strict. After interminable passages of verbal fencing, it was agreed that I should
    assume command of the expedition and carry on, while Eckenstein returned to Pindi with the
    deputy commissioner and took up the matter with the superior authority.</p>
    <p>To sum this episode, Eckenstein chased the culprits all around north India and finally
    cornered George Nathaniel Curzon at the psychological moment when our pathetic cables to
    Lord George Hamilton at India Office had brought the power of Blighty to bear on the
    naughty nabobs. The &quot;superior person&quot; saved his face by authorizing Eckenstein
    to rejoin the party on guarantees for his good conduct subscribed by Knowles and myself!</p>
    <p>We never learnt, and I do not know to this day, the <em>dessous des cartes</em>.
    Eckenstein insistently professed himself in utter ignorance of the reasons which had
    induced the authorities to take their high-handed and futile action. Needless to say, we
    could not but connect it with Eckenstein's quarrel with Conway in 1892. We pumped the
    bigwigs of Kashmir, and we sifted the rumours of the bazaar, but beyond learning that
    Eckenstein was a Prussian spy and a cold-blooded murderer, we obtained little information
    of importance. Eckenstein was the noblest man that I have ever known. His integrity was
    absolute and his sympathetic understanding of the native character supreme. I remain
    unrepentant in my oÿinion that the incident was the result of the unmanly jealousy and
    petty intrigue of the insects who envied him, complicated by official muddle.</p>
    <p>Temporarily deprived of our leader, we went on wearily to Srinagar, the capital of
    Kashmit, which we reached on the fourteenth of April. Several incidents ion the road
    demonstrated the extraordinary importance which the government attached to Eckenstein.
    Though everything had been arranged, there were all sorts of excitement at the frontier,
    and telegrams and spies were bustling about. It reminded me of the turmoil in an ant-had
    which had been disturbed.</p>
    <p>On the fifth day we had our first and last trouble with native. It is part of the
    Indian character to put every new Englishman through an examination in force of character.
    The key of power with all the inhabitants in the Indian peninsula is justice. And this is
    about the only thing one can say which really does apply pretty well the came to their
    infinite diversity. God help the traveller who punishes his servants unjustly! His lack of
    judgment show them a weak point of which they can take advantage to avenge themselves in a
    thousand ways. On the other hand, one is even more despised if one fails to visit
    intentional misbehaviour with the full penalty of the law.</p>
    <p>I was far from well. Various symptoms of malaria kept on cropping up and I was in
    constant pain with pityriasis versicolor, which is a form of the</p>
    <p>{281}</p>
    <p>so-called dhobi itch (a dhobi is a laundryman). One puts on clothes which seem
    spotlessly clean, but they contain the spores of a fungus which grows in the axilla and
    the groin. This got worse and worse. I was idiot enough to put myself in the hands of the
    doctor. I had the superstitious belief that his medical degree meant something. I suffered
    perpetually from the irritation, increased by walking and riding till I got on the glacier
    away from the doctor, when I painted it with iodine, a supersubtle device which had never
    occurred to him, and cured it in twenty-four hours.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day the ekka drivers conspired cautiously to delay us. On the fifth they
    appointed a delegate to give us hell. (The arrangement was that Knowles and I should bring
    up the rear of the procession to prevent any ekkas from straggling.) This man kept on
    making unnecessary repairs in his harness, and finally managed to lock his wheel in that
    of another ekka which happened to meet us. He was delighted to find that I made no
    complaint and he thought that he was going to get away with it. His ekka and ours arrived
    in camp more than an hour after the rest of the party. But the moment we were visible I
    jumped down, fixed my left hand in his beard (itself a blood insult), dragged him from his
    ekka and lammed into him with my belt in view of the whole camp --- apparently without any
    provocation.</p>
    <p>The psychology is instructive. I knew that the man's misbehaviour was a put-up job; in
    beating him, I was establishing the morale of the whole expedition. Their subtle minds
    understood perfectly the essential justice of my action and applauded my perspicuity and
    determination. The result was that I never had the slightest difficulties with natives in
    India ever afterwards and was able to practise perfect tolerance of genuine accidents. I
    had forced them to respect us, which, with an Indian, is the first step to acquiring his
    love. And the men soon showed themselves willing to risk their lives, as they ignorantly
    thought they were being asked to do, in order to please us. Younghusband's expedition of
    Yarkand cost seventeen coolies their lives, and our men were convinced that the object of
    our expedition was to make a new pass to that city. Nothing I could say would persuade
    them otherwise. They came and told me that they knew they were going to die on the journey
    and they were quite willing to do it. They were almost disappointed when I sent them back
    from Camp 10!</p>
    <p>Had I failed to understand the psychology of the ekka driver, we should have been
    nagged to death by pin-pricks. On the way back, crossing the Deosai plateau, we fell in
    with an English lieutenant who, after a fruitless shikar after ibex, had been worried into
    illness and was being deliberately worried to death by his servants, who kept on
    misunderstanding his orders &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot;. They had found out his
    weak spot and had no mercy. The first business of any traveller in any part of the world
    is to</p>
    <p>{282}</p>
    <p>establish his moral superiority. He has to be uniformly calm, cheerful, just,
    perspicacious, indulgent and inexorable. He must decline to be swindled out of the
    fraction of a farthing. If he once gives way, he is done for.</p>
    <p>I remember in my journey across China refusing to buy a few eggs when we were actually
    in sore need of them, because I could not agree with the owner on the price. The sum in
    dispute was much less than a ha'penny, and it was almost a matter of life and death to me;
    but if I had given in, I should never have been able to buy an egg for the rest of the
    journey. The traveller must always remember that his method of striking a match is
    accurately reported for hundreds of miles in every direction. England conquered India by
    understanding the minds of the inhabitants, by establishing her own standards of conduct
    as arbitrary, and contemptuously permitting the native to retain his own wherever they did
    not conflict with the service of the conqueror. England is losing India by consenting to
    admit the existence of the conquered races; by consenting to argue; by trying to find a
    value for incommensurables. Indian civilization is far superior to our own and to enter
    into open competition is to invoke defeat. We won India by matching our irrational,
    bigoted, brutal manhood against their etiolated culture.</p>
    <p>We cannot even plead that we have lacked a prophet. The genius of Rudyard Kipling,
    however aesthetically abominable, has divined the secrets of destiny with cloudless
    clarity. His stories and his sermons are equally informed by the brainless yet
    unanswerable argument based on intuitive cognition of the critical facts. India can be
    governed, as history proves, by any alien autocracy with sufficient moral courage to
    dismiss Hindu subtlety as barbaric and go its own way regardless of reason. But India has
    always conquered its invaders by initiating them. No sooner does the sahib suspect that he
    is not Almighty God than the attributes of Jehovah cease to arm him with unreasonable
    omnipotence. Our rule in India has perished because we have allowed ourselves to consider
    the question of divine right. The proverb says that the gods themselves cannot contend
    with stupidity, and the stupidity of the sahib in the days of Nicholson reduced India to
    impotence. But we allowed the intellectual Bangali to invade England and caress our
    housemaids in the precincts of Earl's Court exhibition. He returned to Calcutta, an
    outcast indeed from his own social system, but yet a conqueror of English fashions and
    femininity. We admitted his claim to compete with us, and our prestige perished exactly as
    did that of the Church when Luther asserted the right of private judgment.</p>
    <p>I am not responsible<strong>1</strong> for the fact that the universe is constructed in
    defiance of the principles of reason. I see perfectly that the crude conceptions of
    European culture are intellectually contemptible; but if we are to enter into</p>
    <p>{283}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">P.S. --- Well, I am not so sure.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>relations of any kind with the East, we must either behave like little children in the
    presence of age and wisdom, or we must be brutal bosses. The soldiers who slew Archimedes
    had only one alternative --- to sit at his feet and learn geometry, and thank him when he
    rapped them over the knuckles. We must therefore choose between shutting up fourteen
    thousand sipahis in a compound an blowing them to pieces with grapeshot in cold blood,
    like Havelock, and sprawling to kiss their slippers like European students of Yoga. Our
    attempt to compromise between incompatible civilizations can only end in our confessing
    the impotence of our own.</p>
    <p>We see, even in England itself, how the abdication of Norman arrogance has let to the
    abrogation of all standards of superiority, so that the man who wishes to govern England
    today is obliged to conform with the dishonest devices and servile stratagems of
    democracy. Government demands virtue; in its etymological sense of manliness. In modern
    England, courage, truthfulness and determination are at a discount. A leader can only lead
    by drugging the populace. When Beaconsfield (wasn't it?) said, &quot;We must educate our
    masters,&quot; he formulated the creed of Communism; for it is impossible to educate the
    people. I myself, despite my public school and university, despite a life devoted to
    continual travel and study of social, political, economic and historical facts, am only
    too well aware of my abject incompetence to provide a remedy for the least of the diseases
    which have come to actual issue. I only know that one must abdicate one's intelligence and
    submit to rule-of-thumb government. The best master is a go-as-you-please generous
    gentleman who settles everything by rude common sense. Our modern pretence at scientific
    government, based on theories and statistics, possesses all the irremediable inadequacies
    of purblind pedantry. My wanderings have shown me that individual happiness and prosperity
    flourished most freely in Mexico under the autocracy of Diaz, Russia under that of the
    tsar, India and Egypt under that of England, and China when the son of Heaven exercised
    supreme and unquestioned sway.</p>
    <p>The last quarter of a century has swamped all these. The world is seething with the
    dissatisfaction that springs from insecurity. Men can adapt themselves to pretty well any
    conditions, but when they do not know from one day to another whether some fundamental
    principle may not be abolished in the interests of progress, they no longer know where
    they are. They tend to adopt the principles of the man who flits from one place to
    another, grabbing portable property and dodging creditors and policemen. Civilization has
    become a hysterical scramble for momentary material advantage. Thrift is senseless when
    one is threatened with a levy on capital. Investment is insane when gilt-edged securities
    may lose two thirds of their value for no assignable reason. Suppose two brothers
    inherited ten thousand pounds apiece in 1900: one keeps his gold in a bag and spends four
    hundred pounds</p>
    <p>{284}</p>
    <p>a year; the other buys Consols and lives on a little over two hundred pounds of the
    income without touching his capital. Today<strong>1</strong> the spendthrift would be
    worth more than his prudent brother. Marriage is a detestable institution, but the
    facilities for divorce (introduced ostensibly in the interests of the woman) have cut away
    the economic ground from under her feet.</p>
    <p>I have little use for Rudyard Kipling, especially in his latter days of senile
    schoolboyishness, aggravated by his addiction to the hydroxide of the second of the
    paraffin radicles. But his general attitude about India obtains my adhesion. We conquered
    the peninsula by sheer moral superiority. Our unity, our self-respect, our courage,
    honesty and sense of justice awakened the wonder, commanded the admiration and enforced
    the obedience of those who either lacked those qualities altogether, possessed some of
    them and felt the lack of the others, or had, actually or traditionally, sufficient of
    them to make them the criteria of right and ability to govern. As elsewhere observed, our
    modern acquiescence in the rationally irrefutable argument that the colour of a man's skin
    does not prevent him from being competent in any given respect, has knocked the
    foundations from underneath the structure of our authority.</p>
    <p>But still more fatal has been our imbecile weakness in allowing India to become aware
    that we are not wholly divine. When the French saw Joan of Arc bleed from a slight wound,
    the tradition of her invulnerability and their superstitious reverence for her as
    supernaturally protected vanished, and her ruin became certain. The heel of Achilles of
    the sahib has been the memsahib. It was atrocious follow to allow Indians to come to
    England to study, to mix freely with our women, often to marry or seduce them. But we
    might have survived that scandal. The returned students, having forfeited caste, had
    forfeited credit. We could have dismissed their accounts of England as the bluster of
    rascals; and, besides, these students were as insignificant in number as in authority with
    their own people.</p>
    <p>But we did worse. In the name of religion and morality (as usual!) we committed a
    political blunder, which was also a social crime, by permitting and even encouraging white
    women to go out to India.</p>
    <p>To begin with, they cannot stand the climate, which compels them to live lives whose
    inevitable tendency is to relax the moral fibre. Thus even highclass memsahibs sometimes
    have themselves bathed by their beras. The excuse is that any sexual irregularity with
    such inferior animals is unthinkable. But &quot;a man's a man for a' that.&quot;
    Incidentally, the heat increases the female lasciviousness as it decreases the male. White
    women are thus subject to continual nervous irritation of which they often fail to suspect
    the character. Besides, the healthiest of them is usually more or less ailing in various
    minor</p>
    <p>{285}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Condensed from an article written in 1917 in New York. Luckily my own
        paper refused to publish it!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>respects. They are usually short-tempered from this and other causes, and any species
    of lack of self-control has a fatal effect on the attitude of the native.</p>
    <p>Apart from this, it seems to him incredibly shameless on our part that our women should
    appear in public at all; that they should do so unguarded and unveiled appears the climax
    of immodesty. Some Englishmen are fatuous enough to suppose that they have explained quite
    nicely to the satisfaction of Indians --- whose point of view in these matters is
    practically identical from Tuticorin to Peshawar, and Chittagong to Karachi; it being an
    imperative necessity imposed by the climate, irrespective of creeds and social conditions
    --- that our customs are compatible with correct conduct and even common decency. Such
    self-delusion marks the utmost limit of bad psychology. India could be kept in order, even
    now, to its own salvation and our great credit and profit, if we would eliminate the
    European women and tradesmen, the competition wallah, and the haw-haw officer, and entrust
    the government of the country to a body of sworn &quot;amurai&quot; vowed like the Jesuits
    to chastity and obedience, together with either poverty or a type of splendour in which
    there should be no element of personal pride or indulgence, but only prestige. Like the
    Jesuits, too, these men should be sworn never to return to Europe as long as they lived.
    The capacity of such men to govern would be guaranteed by the fact of their having
    volunteered to accept such conditions. They would enjoy universal respect and absolute
    trust. They would require no army to enforce their authority. All the best elements of
    India would spontaneously unite to support it. One further condition. They would have to
    be guaranteed against the interference of any ignorant and indifferent House of Commons.
    The stupid callousness of the India Office is as much to be dreaded as the silly
    sentimentalism of sympathizers with &quot;national aspirations&quot;, &quot;the
    brotherhood of man&quot; and all such bunkum.</p>
    <p>In India the rules of caste assured the poorest peasant a livelihood of sorts, bar
    famine and plague, and the future of his children was as certain as sunrise. In
    Anglo-Saxon civilization no one has any guarantee against economic earthquakes and the
    future of his family is pure gambling. Such is the price of what we call progress. We
    cannot even assign a meaning to the word; because no one has any idea of where we are
    going. The most stupid and tyrannical system ever devised is better than our present
    position, provided it be stable. We are in a nightmare in which we cannot calculate the
    result of any action.</p>
    <p>It was an affectation of poetry and romance in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
    centuries to let itself go about the vale of &quot;Cashmere&quot;: &quot;Whom, not having
    seen, we adore.&quot; The descriptions are as vague as they are voluptuous. In reality
    Kashmir has very positive and definite qualities, and they have certainly never been
    suggested by the polite dithyrambs of its distant devotees. Technically, of course, it is
    principally the valley of the</p>
    <p>{286}</p>
    <p>Jhelum. But the country does not impress one as being a valley at all: it is a
    well-watered plateau, ringed by mountains, with a narrow gap through which the river
    empties itself. Its height is from six thousand to eight thousand feet above the sea. The
    climate in spring and summer resembles that of Mexico combined with that of Switzerland.
    The air is clear and exhilarating, yet an atmosphere of peace tempts the wayfarer to pass
    away the time in the delights of love-in-idleness. In winter the snows transform it to a
    fascinating fairyland, rather like northern Europe with the addition of sunlight.</p>
    <p>Srinagar is an ancient and admirable city. Many of the buildings are of wood. It is
    interesting to notice that the bridges are built on the principle of the cantilever, which
    most people believe to be a miracle of modern science; but the idea of the Forth Bridge

    <p>The flowers and trees in Kashmir are very varied. Their rich splendour is superb. There
    are many lakes with floating gardens and on the river are houseboats in which many
    Europeans spend the summer. It is a life of <em>dolce far niete</em> of which the Thames
    could only offer a feeble imitation and Venice itself but a hectic parody.</p>
    <p>There is plenty of shooting in the valley, from bears, deer, wild sheep and wild goats
    to pigeons. I went out occasionally after the bigger game, though I prefer low country
    shooting. I hate climbing hills unless they are really difficult, as I hate everything
    which only goes half way. There is not much fun, either, in pigeon shooting. One does it
    less for pleasure than for profit, and the pigeon is certainly welcome up country as an
    alternative to athletic mutton and chicken.</p>
