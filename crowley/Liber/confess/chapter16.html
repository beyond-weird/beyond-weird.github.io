    <p>Such were some of the adventures of 1896 and 1897. My experiences all contributed to
    build up an original theory of mountaineering. It was not till 1898 that I discovered the
    identity of my own ideas with those of the great climbers. But I discovered the extremely
    unpleasant fact that the English Alpine Club were bitterly opposed to mountaineering ---
    its members were incompetent, insanely jealous of their vested interests and unthinkably
    unsportsmanlike. Professor Norman Collie had proposed me for the club and Sir Martin
    Conway had been kind enough to second me; but the record of climbs which I put in to
    qualify for admission was much too good. It was subversive of all authority. The average
    Alpine clubman qualifies by paying guides to haul him up a few hackneyed peaks. He is not
    expected to do any new climbs whatever; and it is an outrage to the spirit of the club to
    do anything original. Mummery had been blackballed because he was the most famous climber
    in England; and, though occasionally climbing with guides before he found Collie and
    Hastings, had been in fact the leader of the party. The club was, of course, afraid to
    give its real reasons for objecting to him. It circulated the lie that he was a bootmaker!
    Later on, it became a public scandal that he was not a member of the club and he was weak
    enough to allow himself to be elected. In my case, Collie and Conway warned me that my
    election would be opposed and I withdrew my name. On this, the son of a church furnisher
    named Tattersall, who had insinuated himself into Trinity, circulated the rumour that I
    had been expelled from a London club. He hated me because I, as president of the Cambridge
    University Chess club, did not see my way to allow him to become secretary. He was an
    excellent player, but unsuitable for conducting official correspondence with other clubs.
    I went to his rooms with a heavy malacca and demanded that he should retract his falsehood
    or fight. He refused to do either, so I thrashed him soundly then and there. He complained
    to my tutor, who halled me, made a few remarks on the desuetude of the duel, changed the
    conversation to Ibsen and asked me to dinner.</p>
    <p>Mountaineering differs from other sports in one important respect. A man cannot obtain
    a reputation at cricket or football by hiring professionals to play for him. His
    achievements are checked by his averages. But hardly any one in England at that time knew
    anything about mountaineering. Various old fogies, who could not have climbed the simplest
    rocks in Cumberland, or led across an easy Alpine pass, had been personally conducted by
    peasants</p>
    <p>{135}</p>
    <p>up a few mountains and written themselves up into fame. The appearance of the guideless
    climber was therefore a direct challenge. They tried every dirty trick to prevent the
    facts from leaking out. They refused to record the exploits of guideless men in the Alpine
    Journal. They discountenanced even their own members, they tried to ignore English rock
    climbing altogether and would have nothing to do with the continental Alpine clubs.</p>
    <p>The result of this policy was to hinder the development of the sport in England. The
    younger men were ostracized. It was parallel to the attempts of the Church to pretend that
    there was no such thing as science. The result was not dissimilar. In 1901 all the world's
    records, except one, were held by myself and Eckenstein. The exception was that of the
    greatest height attained by man. This was claimed by Matthias Zurbriggen, who was not a
    guide in the ordinary sense of the word, but a convict who had learnt all his climbing
    from Eckenstein at the request of the ne'er-do-weel's family, who didn't know what to do
    with him and probably hoped that he would kill himself on the mountains.</p>
    <p>The Alpine Club even tried to fake records. One party made a great fuss over and ascent
    of the Dent Blanche. It was proved later that they had not been on the mountain at all and
    that one at least of the party --- Smith <em>quidam</em> --- knew it. Again, when I
    arrived at the head of the Baltoro glacier, I questioned some of my coolies who had been
    with the Conway expedition of 1892 about the alleged ascent of Pioneer Peak. The men
    unanimously declared that the party had only gone to the foot of the icefall and had
    turned back from this point. Far be it from me to place any reliance on the statements of
    ignorant Baltis, though I never found them at fault on any other point! But it is
    certainly singular that they should have agreed to give an account of the expedition so
    different from that recorded by the party themselves. Zurbriggen, who was the guide in the
    case, was cross-examined by Legros, the son of the painter, and a friend of Eckenstein's.
    He told a very singular story about Pioneer Peak, but as he was under the influence of
    alcohol I suppose his statements are as unreliable as those of my coolies.</p>
    <p>The coincidence of evidence from two doubtful sources does not necessarily strengthen
    either, does it?</p>
    <p>So bitter has been the hatred of the Alpine club for the people who have exposed its
    principal members as impostors that it has actually induced the bulk of the press to
    ignore expeditions of such first-rate importance as those of 1902 and 1905 to the
    Himalayas. Subsequent exploration has been hampered in consequence; and the manslaughter
    of seven porters on Everest in 1922 was directly due to ignorance of the lesson taught by
    the Kangchenjunga disaster, as will be made clear in the proper place.</p>
    <p>However, my principles have triumphed all along the line. There were no</p>
    <p>{136}</p>
    <p>Swiss guides on Everest in 1922 and the record for altitude is held by amateurs
    travelling two on a rope.</p>
    <p>Let me emphasize the fact that I am absolutely satisfied with this result. I am
    congenitally incapable of personal ambition and envy. My interest is in the sport itself.
    I care nothing for glory. In 1899, for example, I worked out a route up the Aiguille du
    G&#130;ant from the Montanvers. This mountain had never been climbed fairly. The ordinary
    way up is a matter of engineering by means of pitons and wire ropes. I did not keep my
    knowledge to myself in order to have the glory of making the first ascent. I indicated the
    way up to other climbers and was absolutely overjoyed when two Austrian amateurs made the
    climb. In the same way, I am perfectly satisfied at having broken down the dishonest and
    imbecile traditions of Badminton and only regret that I was not in command of the the 1922
    Everest expedition, because that expedition failed and cost heavily in human life. I am
    convinced that if I had been there the summit would have been reached and that no one
    would have been killed. In the expedition of K 2, neither man nor beast was injured, and
    in that to Kangchenjunga, the catastrophe was the direct result of mutinous disobedience
    to my orders. I do not lay claim to personal credit for this record, save in so far as I
    was on the way to an apprehension of the proper principles of mountain craft when I met
    Eckenstein, to whose instructions I am profoundly indebted.</p>
    <p>I have never been in danger on a mountain, except through the rashness of others. Here
    is a typical case. I was crossing the Brêche de la Meije with a porter. About half way
    down the rocky slopes (we had taken off the rope) I stopped for a few minutes for personal
    reasons, never imagining that the boy would get himself into trouble. When I got up he had
    disappeared. I shouted and he replied. I then saw that he had done an incredibly rash
    action. By going on, entirely out of the way, he had crossed a narrow gully which was
    being constantly swept by ice from a hanging glacier. I could not leave him alone on the
    mountain and I could not ask him to risk his life by returning. There was nothing for it
    by to repeat his indiscretion. The only way across the gully was a steep slab, polished by
    ice and constantly bombarded. I had to rush it, at the gravest risk of slipping on the one
    hand and being smashed on the the other.</p>
    <p>It is a remarkable fact that only very exceptional men retain their normal reasoning
    powers in presence of mountains. Both Eckenstein and I have had constant evidence of this.
    It is not merely the panic of the peasant, who loses his head and calls on the saints
    whenever he finds himself a few yards off the beaten track or is overtaken by bad weather.
    Scientifically trained minds frequently lose all sense of judgment and logic.</p>
    <p>There is an account, hardly a century old, of a party of quite distinguished men who
    ascended Saddleback. They speak of precipitous cliffs and yawning</p>
    <p>{137}</p>
    <p>gulfs, though as a matter of fact there is not a rock on the mountain which a child of
    three years old could call scrambling. They were, in fact on ponies! Shelley's
    descriptions of Mont Blanc are comically exaggerated; his powers of observation must have
    been completely in abeyance.</p>
    <p>The expression &quot;absolutely perpendicular&quot; ultimately became a byword. It was
    used so frequently by ostensibly reliable men to describe quite gentle slopes. We used to
    ask engineers and other people accustomed to practical trigonometry to estimate the angle
    of the Matterhorn from Zermatt and from the Schwartzsee. They would give us anything from
    thirty degrees to fifty degrees in the first case and from forty-five degrees to eighty
    degrees in the second. The actually figures are ten degrees and fifteen degrees.</p>
    <p>In 1902 Pfannl proposed to rush Chogo Ri from Askole. He thought he could get there and
    back in three days! In reality, it is fourteen days to the foot of the mountain, though
    unladen men might possibly do it in five. Mountain panic was without doubt partly
    accountable for the mental and moral breakdown in Guillarmod and Righi, which led them to
    mutiny on Kangchenjunga. A high degree of spiritual development, a romantic temperament
    and a profound knowledge based on experience of mountain conditions are the best
    safeguards against the insane impulses and hysterical errors which overwhelm the average
    man.</p>
    <p>During my three years at Cambridge my literary faculties made sudden<br>
    strides. The transition was brief. It is marked my by <em>The Tale of Archais</em>. But in
    <em>Aceldama</em>, my first published poem of any importance, I attained, at a bound, the
    summit of my Parnassus. In a sense, I have never written anything better. It is absolutely
    characteristic. Its technical excellence is remarkable and it is the pure expression of my
    unconscious self. I had no corresponding mental concepts at the time. It enounces a
    philosophy which subsequent developments have not appreciably modified. I remember my own
    attitude to it. It seemed to me a wilfully extravagant eccentricity. I had no idea that it
    was the pure water of the Dircean spring.</p>
    <p>A certain amount of conscious aspiration is, however, evident in <em>Songs of the
    Spirit</em>. This book is a collection of lyrics which reveal an illdefined longing for
    spiritual attainment. The background is vividly coloured by observation and experience.
    The atmosphere of the old streets of Amsterdam, of the colleges of Cambridge and of the
    mountains, lakes, forests and rivers, among which I wandered solitary, is evident in every
    stanza. The influence of my reading is almost negligible. The &quot;wish-phantasm&quot; of
    the book is principally that of a wise and holy man living in a lonely tower, master of
    the secrets of nature. I had little conscious aspiration to that ideal. In practice, I was
    living for pleasure.</p>
    <p>Another book of the transition period was <em>Green Alps</em>. This was never</p>
    <p>{138}</p>
    <p>published. I had paid Leonard Smithers to have it printed and he told me that the
    printers' works had been destroyed by fire, which may or may not have been the case. It is
    characteristic that I accepted the situation with a shrug of the shoulders. I had a
    complete set of proofs, but I had become rather ashamed of the book. I merely selected the
    poems which I though really worth while for inclusion in subsequent volumes. The
    collection was marked by a tendency to earthly passion; and its title shows that I already
    regarded human love as an idea to be transcended. <em>Green Alps</em> are pleasant
    pastures, but I was bound for the peaks.</p>
    <p>My essential spirituality is made manifest by yet another publication, which stands as
    a testimony of my praeterhuman innocence. The book is called <em>White Stains</em> and is
    commonly quoted by my admirers as evidence of my addiction to every kind of unmentionable
    vice. Asses! It is, indeed, technically, an obscene book and yet the fact that I wrote it
    proves the purity of my heart and the mind in the most extraordinary fashion.</p>
    <p>The facts are as follows: In the course of my reading I had come across von
    Krafft-Ebing's <em>Psychopathia Sexualis</em>. The professor tries to prove that sexual
    aberrations are the result of disease. I did not agree. I thought that I was able to
    understand the psychology involved; I thought that the acts were merely magical
    affirmations of perfectly intelligible points of view. I said to myself that I must
    confute the professor. I could only do this by employing the one form at my disposal: the
    artistic form. I therefore invented a poet who went wrong, who began with normal and
    innocent enthusiasms, and gradually developed various vices. He ends by being stricken
    with disease and madness, culminating in murder. In his poems he describes his downfall,
    always explaining the psychology of each act.</p>
    <p>The conclusions of the book might therefore be approved in any Sunday School and its
    metaphysics is orthodox from the point of view of the theologian. I wrote the book in
    absolute seriousness and in all innocence. It never occurred to me that a demonstration of
    the terrible results of misguided passion might be mistaken for pornography. Indeed, now
    that I do understand that vile minds think it a vile book, I recognize with grim
    satisfaction that <em>Psychopathia Sexualis</em> itself has attained its enormous
    popularity because people love to gloat over such things. Its scientific form has not
    protected it from abuse, any more than the artistic form of my own reply to it. But von
    Krafft-Ebing has not been blackguarded as I have. The average man cannot believe that an
    artist may be as serious and highminded an observer of life as the professed man of
    science.</p>
    <p>I was to find very shortly that the most innocent personal relations could be taken by
    filthy minds as the basis for their malicious imagination. The story of how this came
    about dominates my third year at the university, as will appear. It seems as if my destiny
    were preparing me for my appointed</p>
    <p>{139}</p>
    <p>work by clearing inessential factors out of the way. My one serious worldly ambition
    had been to become the champion of the world at chess. I had snatched a game from
    Blackburne in simultaneous play some years before. I was being beaten in the Sicilian
    defence. The only chance was the sacrifice of a rook. I remember the grand old master
    coming round to my board and cocking his alcoholized eye cunningly at me.
    &quot;Hullo,&quot; said he, &quot;Morphy come to town again&quot;! I am not coxcomb enough
    to think that he could not have won the game, even after my brilliancy. I believe that his
    colossal generosity let me win to encourage a promising youngster.</p>
    <p>I had frequently beaten Bird at Simpson's and when I got to Cambridge I made a savagely
    intense study of the game. In my second year I was president of the university and had
    beaten such first-rate amateurs as Gunston and cole. Outside the master class, Atkins was
    my only acknowledge superior. I made mincemeat of the man who was champion of Scotland a
    few years later, even after I had given up the game. I spent over two hours a day in study
    and more than that in practice. I was assured on all hands that another year would see me
    a master myself.</p>
    <p>I had been to St. Petersburg to learn Russian for the Diplomatic Service in the long
    vacation of 1897, and on my way back broke the journey in Berlin to attend the Chess
    Congress. But I had hardly entered the room where the masters were playing when I was
    seized with what may justly be described as a mystical experience. I seemed to be looking
    on at the tournament from outside myself. I saw the masters --- one, shabby, snuffy and
    blear-eyed; another, in badly fitting would-be respectable shoddy; a third, a mere parody
    of humanity, and so on for the rest. These were the people to whose ranks I was seeking
    admission. &quot;There, but for the grace of God, goes Aleister Crowley,&quot; I exclaimed
    to myself with disgust, and there and then I registered a vow never to play another
    serious game of chess. I perceived with praeternatural lucidity that I had not alighted on
    this planet with the object of playing chess.</p>
    <p>Aleister Crowley, by the way! I have not yet explained how I came to have changed my
    name. For many years I had loathed being called Alick, partly because of the unpleasant
    sound and sight of the word, partly because it was the name by which my mother called me.
    Edward did not seem to suit me and the diminutives Ted or Ned were even less appropriate.
    Alexander was too long and Sandy suggested tow hair and freckles. I had read in some book
    or other that the most favourable name for becoming famous was one consisting of a dactyl
    followed by a spondee, as at the end of a hexameter: like &quot;Jeremy Taylor&quot;.
    Aleister Crowley fulfilled these conditions and Aleister is the Gaelic form of Alexander.
    To adopt it would satisfy my romantic ideals. The atrocious spelling A-L-E-I-S-T-E-R was
    suggested as the correct form by Cousin Gregor, who ought to have known</p>
    <p>{140}</p>
    <p>better. In any case, A-L-A-I-S-D-A-I-R makes a very bad dactyl. For these reasons I
    saddled myself with my present nom-de-guerre --- I can't say that I feel sure that I
    facilitated the process of becoming famous. I should doubtless have done so, whatever name
    I had chosen.</p>
