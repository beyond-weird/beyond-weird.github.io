    <p>The twentieth was fine; and we constructed a sledge on which Pfannl could be taken down
    to Rodkass. Wessely was to stay with him permanently and the doctor to return as soon as
    he had settled him on that alp. He left on the twenty-first, which was fine; but
    Eckenstein and I were both ill again towards evening. On the twenty-second it once more
    commenced to <em>graupen</em> and threatened worse. The twenty-third was equally bad.
    Towards evening we perceived a strange phenomenon. We wondered at first if it could be a
    bear. Certainly some animal was approaching the camp on all fours. In the gathering dusk
    even our field glasses left us uncertain, especially as the irregularities of the glacier
    hid it at frequent intervals.</p>
    <p>But where it came close, we realized that it was the doctor. His face was steaming with
    sweat and expressed an agony of fear. Eckenstein was not sympathetic. He merely said,
    &quot;Where's your coolie?&quot; Guillarmod explained that he had left hat specimen of the
    Creator's handiwork in a crevasse. Eckenstein uttered a single violent objurgation which
    opened new vistas on the depth of his feelings. I did not waste even one word --- I was
    putting my boots on. Before Guillarmod had fairly crawled into his tent, Eckenstein and I
    were skimming over the snow on our ski with a coiled rope. (In my haste I forgot to take
    my goggles, which cost me another two days of snow blindness.)</p>
    <p>I got down to the crevasse ahead of Eckenstein, but he shouted to me to wait. Here was
    a chance to show me in practice what he had always claimed in theory; how easily a man
    could be pulled out, using only one hand. The man was quite calm; but had given up hope
    and was committing his soul to Allah. I expect he was mostly worried about the direction
    of Mecca. We had no need of the coiled rope; the doctor had untied himself from his own
    rope and left it lying on the snow! The cowardice, incompetence and imbecility of his
    proceedings remain today as incomprehensible as they were then.</p>
    <p>(I accuse myself of having minimized these things. I should never have agreed to take
    him on my next expedition, but I liked the man personally so much that I instinctively
    made every allowance for him, and unquestionably he was suffering no less than the rest of
    us. I have a fatal weakness for believing the best about everybody. In the face of the
    plainest evidence, I cannot believe in the existence of dishonesty and malice, and I
    always try to build with rotten material. I always imagine that I have merely to point out
    an error for it to be energetically eliminated, and I am constantly lost in mild surprise</p>
    <p>{323}</p>
    <p>when the inevitable occurs. Here is a description by himself on one of his bad days.</p>
    <p>Pour moi, je reste couché, atteint d'une attaque d'influenza plus forte que je n'en ai
    jamais eu: la fièvre n'est pas très intense, mais mes amygdales sont si tuméfiées et
    douloureuses gue j'ai beaucop de peine à respirer; le moindre mouvement produit un accès
    de suffocation; impossible de dormir; des douleurs lancinantes et des frissons me
    torturent horriblement.)</p>
    <p>Eckenstein, punctiliously putting his left hand behind his back, pulled the coolie out
    with his right, though entirely unaided by the man himself. He had made up his mind to die
    and rather resented our interference!</p>
    <p>On the twenty-sixth my eyes were better and I felt quite well on the morning of the
    twenty-seventh. I had discovered that Wessely, before he left the camp, had stolen the
    bulk of our emergency rations, which consisted mostly of selbst-kocher which contained
    delicacies dear to the Czech palate. We decided to courtmartial him at Rodkass and I wrote
    the speech of the prosecution on the morning of the twenty-seventh. In the afternoon I got
    a violent liver chill and was utterly prostrated for the rest of the day. There was much
    vomiting.</p>
    <p>The storm, after a short break, became more violent than ever. On the twenty-eighth my
    fever and the storm continued unabated. On the twenty-ninth the storm continued without
    abatement and so did my fever. Vomiting again complicated things. On the thirtieth it
    cleared in the afternoon and my fever broke in sleep and perspiration. The night was very
    cold and the morrow fine until the evening, when snow began to fall, gently indeed, but
    with inexorable cruelty. I was well on the first of August, but the snowstorm had
    developed extraordinary violence. A man came up from the valley with khabar (news) that
    cholera had closed the right bank of the Bralduh Nala. It looked as though our retreat had
    been cut off. </p>
    <p>On the second the storm raged without letting up for a moment. I had really made up my
    mind, ever since it had been decided to give up the idea of climbing the mountain direct
    from Camp 10, and from my instinctive judgment of weather, that the expedition had failed
    in its main objective, and I was not in the least interested in killing myself gradually
    against my judgment. I was absolutely satisfied with the results of my original
    reconnaissance of Chogo Ri, and the Archangel Gabriel could not have convinced me that we
    were likely to succeed in forcing a ridge over three miles long of the moist desperate
    character.</p>
    <p>I have also an instinct about weather. I know when it breaks for good. I cannot explain
    it; but there is an absolutely definite difference in what one feels in two apparently
    similar storms. One will blow itself out in preparation</p>
    <p>{324}</p>
    <p>for a cloudless fortnight and the other will be the prelude to more Wagner. I was also
    perfectly convinced that Collie's ideas were correct. We had exhausted our vital capital;
    we were none of us fit to climb anything. In particular, we lacked the fine flower of
    vitality: the spiritual energy and enthusiasm. I doubt whether even a fortnight's fine
    weather would have restored us to the proper condition for an attempt on a mountain.</p>
    <p>On August 3rd the storm was still going strong; but we packed and went down on the
    fourth to Camp 9, stopping at Camp 10, where many of our kiltas were still stored, to pick
    out anything that was worth taking home (which we calculated as anything worth over half a
    crown a pound) and anything which we immediately wanted, especially sugar, of which we
    were already in sore need. On the fifth we lay idle in medium weather, while the coolies
    brought down from Camp 10 the goods which we had selected, and on the sixth we went to
    Camp 7.</p>
    <p>The condition of the lower glacier was astonishing. Despite all these weeks of
    snowstorm, it had been stripped of every vestige of snow, whereas on coming up we had
    walked on smooth slopes. We found dry glacier, most of which was baby s&#130;racs up to
    fifteen feet high, sharp, slim needles of ice which were of course impossible to
    negotiate. We simply had to dodge them. I was constantly ill with fever, diarrhoea and
    vomiting, and only recovered when I got to Ghomboro. The symptoms were literally
    continuous. Every few hundred yards I had to stop, go through it and go on.</p>
    <p>On the seventh we rested at Camp 7. It was fine and the temperature in my tent was
    37°; but the high peaks were &quot;smoking their pipes&quot; so that a violent wind must
    have been blowing up there; and as the morning advanced, the clouds gathered. However, I
    took a chance; and washed. It is a curiously refreshing sensation. I sometimes wonder why
    people do not indulge in it more often. On the eighth we went to Camp 6. My indiscreet
    debauch with water had added a cold in the head to my other miseries. Again a fine morning
    degenerated into thick weather. We rested on the ninth and went to Camp 5 on the tenth. It
    was cloudy all day and in the afternoon we had a violent storm of rain. On the eleventh we
    went to Rodokass direct by short cut, passing over a very beautiful scree whose stones
    were iridescent; every colour of the spectrum glistened on their rain-washed surfaces.</p>
    <p>On the twelfth we held a durbar and expelled Wessely from the expedition. Pfannl
    decided to go with him. Pfannl was now more or less well again, but he would never be able
    to climb mountains in the future. It poured with rain all day and the following, which I
    spent in bed. On the fourteenth we went to Camp 1. It took me ten hours; the last part of
    the march was very bad, the enormous increase of water having made some sections of the
    march impossible by the route previously taken. I was well enough to eat.</p>
    <p>{325}</p>
    <p>The weather was fairly fine, bar one or two snowstorms; but it snowed all night.</p>
    <p>On the fifteenth I went to Payu. Before leaving the glacier I had another attack of
    fever and was obliged to lie down for three hours. The weather had become quite chronic.
    There were glimpses of sun; but for the most part we had clouds and rain. I should remark
    (by the way) that people who live in cities have quite different standards of bad weather
    from open-air folk. When one is living in a tent, on discovers that it is very rare indeed
    to experience twenty hours of continuous bad weather. There is nearly always a period of
    the day when one can get at least an hour or two which is fairly decent. The townsman's
    observations are confined to a small section of the day. The weather on the Baltoro
    glacier may therefore be judged as quite exceptionally abominable.</p>
    <p>I have had very bad luck (on the whole) with my weather on mountains. Even in Mexico,
    we had a fortnight of cold and wet which had no parallel in the memory of man, and caused
    the stoves in the city to be sold out in the first forty-eight hours. Then I was once at
    Wastdale Head for forty-three days when it rained quite continuously except on one morning
    and one afternoon. On the other hand, during the nine days I was at Akyab it once stopped
    raining for nearly twenty minutes. I ought to have taken the exact time: but I thought the
    end of the world had come, so that it never occurred to me to look at my watch till it
    began again.</p>
    <p>I had been altogether sixty-eight days on the glacier, two days longer than any other
    member of the party. It was another world's record; and, as far as I know, stands to this
    hour. I hope I may be allowed to die in peace with it. It would be a sorry ambition in
    anyone to grasp my laurels and I can assure him that to refrain will bring its own reward.
    Of these sixty-eight days, eight only were fine, and of these no three were consecutive.
    Of course some days were of mixed character. But in no case have I classed as bad weather
    any days which would be considered in the Alps fine enough to go out on an average
    second-rate peak.</p>
    <p>An almost unbelievable impression insisted on stamping itself on my reluctant mind.
    Eckenstein and Knowles were really upset by the reports of the cholera in the Bralduh
    Nala. It is true that by all accounts it was pretty bad. One report said that a hundred
    men had died. For some reason I treated the whole thing with scepticism; and when I passed
    through Askole I certainly saw no signs of agitation or mourning. The only precaution I
    took was to prevent my men coming in contact with the villagers.</p>
    <p>But Eckenstein and Knowles would not pass through the village at all. They decided to
    return to Shigar by the Skoro La, which is a pass avoiding the big bend formed by the
    Bralduh Nalan and the Shigar Rivers. It is just about as many days' march and is decidedly
    harder on the men. So the doctor</p>
    <p>{326}</p>
    <p>and I went round by the valley. At Ghomboro we hound fresh apricots, and after a final
    go of indigestion caused by surfeit of fresh mulberries and melons at Shigar my health
    cleared up with astonishing rapidity. Within a week I was in perfectly good form again and
    convinced more than ever that mountains as such have precious little to do with mountain
    sickness.</p>
    <p>I noticed later that Sir Richard Burton, from even his small experience, remarked that
    he did not believe that the symptoms were due to altitude but to indigestion. Burton was
    always my hero and the best thing about him is his amazing common sense. In one place, for
    instance, he refers to influenza as &quot;that dreadful low fever called influenza&quot;:
    which is exactly the truth. When one compares with this description the buckets full of
    pseudo-scientific bilge of modern medicine, one's disgust makes one long for the level
    heads and clear eyes of such men as Burton.</p>
    <p>The descent to the valley offered little new to the eye. The broad Mud Nala had
    cakeddry; but before doing so it had overflowed to an extra hundred yards or so in breadth
    in one place. The Narrow Nala was still wet, but not so deep in mud. At Dasso we found
    fresh apples; and at our next camp, just beyond Yuno, fresh peaches. This last march was
    very severe, over nine hours across blazing sand without a square foot of shelter
    anywhere. On the following day a new experience was in store. We were able to travel by
    zak.</p>
    <p>The zak is a local variety of raft; to a framework of crossed bamboos are bound a
    number of goat skins. Our raft had twenty-four: six one way and four the other. As these
    goat skins all leak, one has to find a landing place every twenty minutes or so, and this
    is not always easy. The great danger is that one may stick on a submerged rock. It would
    be quite impossible to get off and quite impossible to get ashore, though one might be
    only six feet from the bank. At each corner is a man with a long bamboo pole to fend off
    rocks. But otherwise little can be done to direct one's course or even to steer
    sufficiently to prevent the zak turning round and round. I was reminded of Ben Gunn's
    coracle in <em>Treasure Island</em>. The behaviour of a zak on a sea confirms the analogy,
    for at one place the river was traversed by rows of waves five or six feet high.</p>
    <p>It seemed inconceivable that we should not be swamped. We kept our places by wedging
    our feet between the bamboos and holding on to them with out hands. The current is
    appallingly swift. We had begun our &quot;adventure by water&quot; in crossing the Yuno,
    for we were on the wrong side of the river, and a man had had to be sent down from far
    above to arrange for the raft to take us over. (Until one actually goes travelling in a
    country of this sort, one can form no idea whatever of the frequency of utterly
    insuperable obstacles. It was not our fault, for instance, that we were on the wrong side
    of the river, for the other bank involved a detour of some three days.)</p>
    <p>{327}</p>
    <p>It required more than one voyage to cross the river. It could not have been crossed at
    all but for the fact that it is divided into seven streams, only one of which could not be
    forded. Naturally, a passage was chosen where the current was least formidable. But for
    all that we were swept down about three-quarters of a mile in order to cross less than two
    hundred yards. In order to regain its starting point for the next journey the zak had to
    be carried up stream a couple of miles. So much for mere crossing. But the next day we
    were only three hours and ten minutes actual going to Shigar, which in the ordinary way is
    three long marches.</p>
    <p>The pace of the current varies enormously. Sometimes we were kept half an hour at a
    time spinning about amid contending eddies; sometimes we were flung violently down the
    stream at over twenty miles an hour. The sensation is extraordinarily exhilarating --- the
    motion, the imminent peril, the intoxication of the air, the majesty of the background,
    but above all, the beatific realization that, as the doctor said, &quot;the roads are
    doing our walking for us,&quot; combined to make me delirious with delight. Great too was
    the joy of rejoining Knowles and Eckenstein, who had now recovered their equanimity. We
    all went down to Skardu in two hours on a big zak. There we found fresh ripe grapes,
    potatoes and green corn. Our joy was unconfined; youth at the prow and pleasure at the
    helm!</p>
