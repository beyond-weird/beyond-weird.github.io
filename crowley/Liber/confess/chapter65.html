    <p>In London I put my foot down at once by taking away my daughter until Rose agreed to
    follow the doctor's instructions and get rid of her dipsomania once and for all. She
    capitulated and the necessary measures were taken. This left me free for my proposed
    Retirement, which I decided to undertake in Paris rather than London. The details of every
    single minute of my life for the next fortnight are accurately recorded in &quot;John St.
    John&quot;. Here I need only say that the work was successful beyond all expectations. I
    not only achieved my stated object, but obtained access to a reserve of energy which
    carried me on for years, performing Herculean labours without conscious effort. My time
    was in fact very fully taken up with the preparation of <em>The
    Equinox</em></a>. I had to be constantly seeing Fuller, who was editing my Magical Records
    and the vast mass of material connected with the G.'. D.'., besides which I had my own
    work to do preparing the books of instruction on a special and scientific basis.</p>
    <p>Besides this, I was writing a good deal of poetry. Some of my most important work
    belongs to this period. &quot;The Wizard Way&quot;, &quot;the Garden of Janus&quot;,
    &quot;After Judgment&quot; and &quot;Bathyllus&quot; are especially notable. I was seeing
    a good deal of Frank Harris, who was publishing much of my best work in <em>Vanity Fair</em>.
    It was the first encouragement I had ever had, and in a way it came too late, since I was
    already entirely disillusioned with regard to fame. The approval of Frank Harris was
    another matter; it was something, and something very great, to know that my work gained me
    the respect of the very few men on the planet who knew the difference between Keats and
    Lewis Morris. I had been recognized as a poet of the first class by my peers and the
    applause of the mob would leave me as cold as its neglect or hostility does at present.</p>
    <p>I kept hard at work in London until after the publication of the first number of <em>The Equinox</em></a>. There was, besides, much work to
    be done in reorganizing the order, to which many people were anxious to obtain admission.
    My domestic tragedy was coming to a crisis. The disease seemed incurable. The doctor said
    that the only hope was for Rose to sign away her liberty for two years, and as she refused
    to do this there was nothing for it but for me to obtain a divorce. There was no sense in
    my being plaintiff, though I had plenty of ground. To me it seemed a breach of the pledge
    to protect one's wife, which is the first point of a husband's honour. It was consequently
    agreed that Rose should be plaintiff and the necessary evidence was manufactured in the
    usual way.</p>
    <p>{594}</p>
    <p>My year was very much broken into by the vicissitudes of this wretched business. Rose
    was always begging to be taken back and it was very hard for me to be firm. I made things
    as easy as possible for her by spending as much time with her as I could. The marriage
    having been in Scotland, there was no King's Proctor to cause one's knees to tremble, and
    it was unlikely that any spies would discover that we were living together, to all intents
    and purposes, the whole time the divorce was pending.</p>
    <p>Apart from short trips to Paris, I was in England till autumn, when I thought it best
    to keep well out of the way during the actual time of the trial. I took Neuburg to be my
    chela and we left London on November 10th. In the meanwhile I was doing comparatively
    little personal magical work and my lyrics were all of lesser importance. The fact of the
    matter was that I had got to the end of my tether. The gods had put their foot down ---
    thus far and no farther! I felt myself my life had become broken up into a succession of
    insignificant adventures. But I did not know why. The reason was that one cannot work
    beyond a certain point in a New Aeon on a formula of the Old, and I had sealed my stubborn
    refusal to make <em>The Book of the Law</em> the basis of my work by taking advantage of
    the technical excuse that I could do nothing in the absence of the manuscript. And that
    had been lost for years.</p>
    <p>It was part of my plan for <em>The Equinox</em> to prepare a final edition of the work
    of Dr. Dee an Sir Edward Kelly. I had a good many of the data and promised myself to
    complete them by studying the manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford --- which,
    incidentally, I did in the autumn --- but it struck me that it would be useful to get my
    large paintings of the four Elemental Watch Towers which I had made in Mexico. I thought
    these were probably in Boleskine. I decided to go up there for a fortnight or so.
    Incidentally, I had the conveniences for conferring upon Neuburg the degree of neophyte,
    he having passed brilliantly through his year as a probationer.</p>
    <p>I consequently asked him, and an Emmanuel man named Kenneth Ward, to come and stay with
    me. I had met Ward at Wastdale Head shortly before, having gone there to renew my ancient
    loves with the creeds of the gullies. It happened that Ward was very keen on skiing. I had
    several spare pairs and offered to give him some. This casual circumstance proved an
    essential part of the chain by which I was ultimately dragged behind the chariot of the
    Secret Chiefs. At least I thought it was a chain., I did not realize that steel of such
    exquisite temper might be beaten into a sword fit for the hand of a free man.</p>
    <p>To my annoyance I could not find the elemental Watch Towers anywhere in the house. I
    daresay I gave up looking rather easily. I had got into a state of disgusted indifference
    about such things. Rose might have destroyed them in a drunken fit, just as she might have
    pawned them if they had</p>
    <p>{595}</p>
    <p>possessed any commercial value. I shrugged my shoulders accordingly and gave up the
    search. The skis that I had promised Ward were not to be found any more than the Watch
    Towers. After putting Neuburg through this initiation<strong>1</strong>, we repaired to
    London. I had let the house and my tenant was coming in on the first of July. We had four
    days in which to amuse ourselves; and we let ourselves go for a thorough good time. Thus
    like a thunderbolt comes the incident of June 28th, thus described in my diary:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Glory be to Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit in the highest! A little before midday I was
      impelled mysteriously (though exhausted by playing fives, billiards, etc. till nearly six
      this morning) to make a final search for the Elemental Tablets. And lo! when I had at last
      abandoned the search, I cast mine eyes upon a hole in the loft where were ski, etc., and
      there, O Holy, Holy, Holy! were not only all that I sought, but the manuscript of <em>Liber
      Legis</em>!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The ground was completely cut away from under my feet. I remained for two whole days
    meditating on the situation --- in performing, in fact, a sort of supplementary Sammasati
    to that of 1905. Having the knack of it, I reached a very clear conclusion without too
    much difficulty. The essence of the situation was that the Secret Chiefs meant to hold me
    to my obligation. I understood that the disaster and misery of the last three years were
    due to my attempt to evade my duty. I surrendered unconditionally, as appears from the
    entry of July 1st.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I once more solemnly renounced all that I have or am. On departing (at midnight from
      the topmost point of the hill which crowns my estate) instantly shone the moon, two days
      before her fullness, over the hills among the clouds.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This record is couched in very general terms, but it was intended to cover the
    practical point of my resuming the task laid upon me in Cairo exactly as I might be
    directed to do by my superiors.</p>
    <p>Instantly my burden fell from my back. The long crucifixion of home life came to a
    crisis immediately on my return to London. At the same time every other inhibition was
    automatically removed. For the first time since the spring of 1904 I felt myself free to
    do my will. That, of course, was because I had at last understood what my will was. My
    aspiration to be the means of emancipating humanity was perfectly fulfilled. I had merely
    to establish in the world the Law which had been given me to proclaim: &quot;... thou hast
    no right but to do thy will.&quot; Had I bent my energies from the first to proclaiming
    the Law of Thelema I should doubtless have found no obstacle in</p>
    <p>{596}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">The preparation for this was in some ways trying to the candidate. For
        instance, he had to sleep naked for seven nights on a litter of gorse.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>my path. Those which naturally arise in the course of any work soever would have been
    quietly removed by the Secret Chiefs. But I had chosen to fight against myself for five
    years and &quot;If Satan shall be divided against Satan, how shall his kingdom
    stand?&quot; The more I strove, the more I encouraged an internal conflict and stultified
    myself. I had been permitted to complete my initiation, for the reason that by doing so I
    was fitting myself for the fight; but all my other efforts had met with derisory disaster.
    More, one does not wipe out a lustre of lunacy by a moment of sanity. I am suffering to
    this day from the effects of having wasted some of the best years of my life in the stupid
    and stubborn struggle to set up my conscious self against its silent sovereign, my true
    soul. &quot;Had Zimri peace who slew his master?&quot;</p>
    <p>The superficial reader may smile at my superstition. Why should I be so sure that the
    accident of finding an old portfolio in a loft was no accident, but a <em>coup de maÓtre</em>
    struck by people, for all anyone can prove, who have no existence except in my diseased
    imagination? I could answer the criticism by massing the evidence, but I prefer to leave
    that to be studied in another place when the facts have been marshalled so formidably that
    it is impossible for any reasonable being not to conclude that a praeterhuman agency was
    at work on my life. I will merely point out that in modern science the test of truth is
    less the degree of the probability of any fact, than that which is implied by the text
    &quot;Wisdom is justified of her children&quot;. Facts are judged by their fertility. When
    a discovery remains sterile, the evidence of its truth is weakened. The indication is that
    it is not a stone in the temple of truth; it does not fit in with the entire fabric of
    knowledge. A new fact proves itself by its fitness; isolated, it is repugnant to the
    continuity of nature. When it is seen to explain cognate difficulties, to complete
    imperfect conceptions; when it leads to lives of research which bear fruit, some
    sixtyfold, some eightyfold and some an hundredfold, then it becomes impregnable. My
    conviction in the reality of my magical experiences does not depend on any single event.
    It is because so many incidents, each one more or less incredible and inexplicable when
    considered by itself, become inevitable when considered in their totality and, instead of
    themselves requiring to be explained, are the means of throwing light upon every obscure
    corner of the cosmos.</p>
    <p>The mere potency of the incident of June 28th proves that its implications were
    enormously beyond itself. I was inured to miracles of every kind and I no more allowed
    them to influence my action that Professor Ray Lankester is guided in his researches by <em>Napoleon's
    Dream Book</em><strong>1</strong>. The finding of the manuscript was not even a miracle;
    it happened in the ordinary course of nature. There was nothing so wonderfully remarkable
    about its character. It is this very fact that makes us ask how it is that so ordinary a
    circumstance should have been the power to break down the resolute resistance of a</p>
    <p>{597}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Such, at least, is a tenable hypothesis. I have no direct evidence that
        he does not do so!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Magician whose will had been developed to the utmost by every type of training from
    evocation to exploration?</p>
    <p>The answer can only be that, exactly as Coriolanus, insensible to all other appeals,
    was touched by the tears of his mother, so I, whose determination had defied every form of
    pressure, direct and indirect, was only waiting to hear the unmistakable voice of my
    Master, and that this insignificant incident supplied the intuitive certainty: that none
    other than he was behind it. The finer minds among men can oppose intellectual criticism
    to intellectual demonstration; to the subtle assurances of intuitions which are perhaps
    imperceptible of articulate expression they can find no answer.</p>
    <p>I knew in myself from the first that the revelation in Cairo was the real thing. I have
    proved with infinite pains that this was the case; yet the proof has not strengthened my
    faith, and disproof would no nothing to shake it. I knew in myself that the Secret Chiefs
    had arranged that the manuscript of <em>The Book of the Law</em> should have been hidden
    under the Watch Towers and the Watch Towers under the skis; that they had driven me to
    make the key to my position the absence of the manuscript; that they had directed Kenneth
    Ward's actions for years that he might be the means of the discovery, and arranged every
    detail of the incident in such a way that I should understand it as I did.</p>
    <p>Yes; this involves a theory of the powers of the Secret Chiefs so romantic and
    unreasonable that is seems hardly worth a smile of contempt. As it happens, an almost
    parallel phenomenon came to pass ten years later. I propose to quote it here in order to
    show that the most ordinary events, apparently disconnected, are in fact only intelligible
    by postulating some such people as the Secret Chiefs of the A.'. A.'. in possession of
    some such prevision and power as I ascribe to them. When I returned to England at
    Christmas 1919, all my plans had gone to pieces owing to the dishonesty and treachery of a
    gang which was bullying into insanity my publisher in Detroit. I was pledged in honour to
    look after a certain person; but I was practically penniless. I could not see any possible
    way of carrying on my work. (It will be related in due course how this condition of things
    came about and why it was necessary for me to undergo it.)</p>
    <p>I found myself at MorÍt, on the edge of the Forest of Fountainebleau, with nothing to
    do but wait. I did not throw up the sponge in passionate despair as I had done once
    before, to my shame --- I had been rapped sufficiently hard on the knuckles to cure me of
    that --- but I said to the gods: &quot;Observe, I have done my damnedest and here I am at
    a dead centre. I am not going on muddling through: I demand a definite sign from you that
    I am still your chosen prophet.&quot; I therefore note in my diary, on January 12th 1920,
    as follows:</p>
    <p>{598}</p>
    <p>I am inclined to make my Silence include all forms of personal work, and this is very
    hard to give up, if only because I am still afraid of &quot;failure&quot;, which is
    absurd. I ought evidently to be non-attached even to avoiding the
    Woes-Attendant-Upon-Refusing-The-Curse-Of-My-Grade, if I may be pardoned the expression.</p>
    <p>And why should I leave my Efficacious Tortoise and look at people till my lower jaw
    hangs down? Shall I see what the <em>Yi</em> says? Ay. Question: Shall I abandon all
    magical work soever until the appearance of a manifest sign?</p>
    <p>Answer:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ No symbol could be more definite
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ and unambiguous.
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I have invoked Aiwaz to manipulate the Sticks; and, wishing to ask, &quot;What shall be
    the Sign?&quot; got instantly the reference in CCXX to Our Lady Babalon: &quot;... the
    omnipresence of my body.&quot; But this is not quite clear; I took it mentally as
    referring to the expected arrival of Our Lady, but it might mean a trance, or almost
    anything. So I will ask <em>Yi</em>, as my last magical act for the time being.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ I think this means the arrival of
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ our Lady. I have serious doubts
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ whether the hexagram should not
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ have been:
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹</pre>
      <pre>‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ which would have certainly meant
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ that. That I should doubt anything
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ is absurd: I shall know the Sign,
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ without fail. And herewith I close
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ the Record and await that Sign.
‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The next entry is dated Sunday, February 1st.</p>
    <p>Kindly read over the entry of Jan. 12th with care exceeding. Now then: On Friday, Jan.
    30th, I went to Paris to buy pencils, Mandarin, a Palette, Napoleon Brandy, canvases and
    other appurtenances of the artist's dismal trade. I took occasion to call upon an old
    mistress of mine, Jane ChÈron, concerning whom see <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, No. VI</a>, &quot;Three Poems</a>&quot;. She has never had the slightest
    interest in occult matters and she has never done any work in her life, even of the
    needlework order. I had seen her once before since my escape from America, and she said
    she had something to show me, but I took no particular notice and she did not insist. My
    object in calling on this second occasion was multiple. I wanted to see the man with whom
    she was living, who had not yet</p>
    <p>{599}</p>
    <p>returned from Russia; I wanted to make love to her, and I wanted to smoke a few pipes
    of opium with her, she being a devotee of that great and terrible god.</p>
    <p>Consider now: The Work whereby I am a Magus began in Cairo (1904) with the discovery of
    the stele of Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, in which the principal object is the body of our Lady Nuith.
    It is reproduced in colours in <em>The Equinox</em>, Vol.
    I, No. VII</a>. Jane ChÈron has a copy of this book. On Friday afternoon, then, I was in
    her apartment. I had attained none of my objectives in calling on her and was about to
    depart. She detained me to show me this &quot;something&quot;. She went and took a folded
    cloth from a drawer. &quot;Shut your eyes,&quot; she said.</p>
    <p>When I opened them, they saw a cloth four feet or more in length, on which was a
    magnificent copy, mostly in appliqu&#130; silk, of the stele. She then told me that in
    February 1979, she and her young man had gone to the south of France to get cured of the
    opium habit. In such cases insomnia is frequent. One night, however, he had gone to sleep
    and on waking in the morning found that she, wakeful, had drawn a copy of the stele on a
    great sheet of paper.</p>
    <p>It is very remarkable that so large a sheet of paper should have been at hand; also
    that they should have taken that special book on such a journey; but still more that she
    should have chosen that picture, nay, that she, who had never done anything of the sort
    before, should have done it at all. More yet, that she should have spent three months in
    making a permanent thing of it. Most of all, that she should have shown it to me at the
    very moment when I was awaiting an &quot;unmistakable&quot; sign.</p>
    <p>For observe, how closely the words of my entry of January 12th describe the Sign,
    &quot;... the omnipresence of my body.&quot; And there She was --- in the last place in
    the world where one would have sought Her.</p>
    <p>‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    Note too, the ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    accuracy of the ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    &quot;Yi King&quot; symbol ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
    ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ for ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ is, of course<br>
    the symbol of our Lady, and the God below Her in the stele<br>
    ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹<br>
    is ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹ the sun.<br>
    ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹</p>
    <p>All this is clear proof of the unspeakable power and wisdom of those who have sent me
    to proclaim the Law.</p>
    <p>I observe, after a talk with M. Jules Courtier yesterday, that all their S.P.R. work is
    proof of extra-human forces. We knew about them all along; the universe is full of obscure
    and subtle manifestations of energy;we are constantly advancing in our knowledge and
    control of them. Telekinesis is of the same order of nature as the Hertz rays or</p>
    <p>{600}</p>
    <p>the radium emanations. But what nobody before me has done is to prove the existence of
    extra-human intelligence, and my Magical Record does this. I err in the interpretation, of
    course; but it is impossible to doubt that there is a somebody there, a somebody capable
    of combining events as a Napoleon forms his plans of campaign, and possessed of powers
    unthinkably vast.</p>
    <p>If these events be indeed the result of calculation and control on the part of the
    Secret Chiefs, it seems at first sight as if the people involved had been prepared to play
    their parts from the beginning. Our previous relations, the girl's addiction to opium, my
    friendship with her lover, and his interest in my work; omit any item and the whole plan
    fails. But this assumption is unnecessary. The actual preparation need not go back further
    than three years, when the stele was embroidered. We may allow the Secret Chiefs
    considerable option, just as a chess player is not confined to one special combination for
    his attack. We may suppose that had these people not been available, the sign which I
    demanded might have been given me in some other equally striking way. We are not obliged
    to make extravagant assumptions in order to maintain that the evidence of purpose is
    irresistibly strong.</p>
    <p>To dismiss this intricate concatenation of circumstances, culminating as they do in the
    showing forth of the exact sign which I had demanded, is simply to strain the theory of
    probabilities beyond the breaking point. Here then are two complicated episodes which go
    to prove that I am walking, not by faith but by sight, in my relations with the Secret
    Chiefs; and these are but two links in a very long chain. This account of my career will
    describe many others equally striking. I might, perhaps, deny my inmost instinct the right
    to testify were any one case of this kind in question; but when, year after year, the same
    sort of thing keeps on happening and when, furthermore, I find myself able to predict, as
    experience has taught me to do in the last three years, that they will happen, and even
    how the pieces will fit into the puzzle, I am justified in assuming a causal connection.</p>
    <p>As any billiard player knows, while a ten-shot might be fluked by a novice, or even
    that he might run up a break of twenty or thirty now and again, a consistent sequence of
    breaks averaging twenty-five over a series of months cannot possibly happen by chance;
    this proves impugnably both that certain management of the cue combined with judgment must
    result in certain movements of the balls, and that skill and not luck determines the
    success of the player. Again, at roulette a run of one hundred on red might happen once in
    a thousand years by pure chance; but if it occurred a dozen times a night for a week it
    would prove that the table is furnished with a mechanical device by which the croupier
    could control the fall of the ball.</p>
    <p>{601}</p>
    <p>From this time I accepted the Law in its entirety; that is, I admitted its absolute
    authority. I was not, however, at the end of my difficulties. Much of the book was
    unintelligible, and many passages, especially in Chapter III, entirely repugnant. I was
    content to leave these points to be cleared up by the gods themselves in their own good
    time. They had proved that I could trust them to manage what was after all their own
    affair and not mine. I refrained from pushing my criticism. I took the general sense of
    the Book, so far as I understood it, as at once the starting point and the summit of my
    Magick.</p>
    <p>This change of attitude was tremendous. I had always been tongue-tied in the matter of
    expressing my spiritual self in poetry and my lyrics had been comparatively unimportant.
    The dealt only with certain aspects of the matter. I could point to nothing which really
    represented my personality as a whole or brought the events of my career into intelligible
    relation. The more I learned to study and love <em>The Book of the Law</em>, the better I
    was able to integrate myself.</p>
    <p><em>Sir Palamedes</em> was the most ambitious attempt to describe the Path of the Wise
    as I knew it. It is in its way almost complete, but there is no attempt to show the
    necessary sequence of the ordeals described in each section. The last section, in which
    Sir Palamedes, after achieving every possible task and finding that all his attainments
    did not bring him to the end of his Quest, abandons the following of the Questing Beast;
    he returns, discomfited, to the Round Table, only to find that, having surrendered, the
    Questing Beast comes to him of its own accord.</p>
    <p>I could not pretend that this was more than a <em>tour de force</em>, an evasion of the
    issue. I know now that the true solution is this: there is no goal to be attained, as I
    had reached Madrid; the reward is in the march itself. As soon as I got to Madrid my
    adventures were at an end. If I had had to stay there I should have been bored to death,
    even if it had been the city of God itself. The joy of life consists in the exercise of
    one's energies, continual growth, constant change, the enjoyment of every new experience.
    To stop means simply to die.</p>
    <p>The eternal mistake of mankind is to set up an attainable ideal. Sir Palamedes
    expressed himself fully in following the Questing Beast. His success (as described in the
    poem) would in reality have left him with nothing to live for. My own life has been
    indescribably ecstatic, because even when I thought that there was a reward and a rest at
    the end, my imagination pictured them as so remote that I was in no danger of getting what
    I wanted. I am now wise enough to understand that every beat of my pulse marks a moment of
    exquisite rapture in the consciousness that the curve of my career is infinite, that with
    every breath I climb closer and closer to the limit, yet can never reach it. I am always
    aspiring, always attaining; nothing can</p>
    <p>{602}</p>
    <p>stop me, not even success. I had some perception of this in these years of my life in
    London, for I wrote in <em>The Book of Lies</em>: &quot;Only those are happy who have
    desired the unattainable.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The Equinox&quot; should have been, on its merits, a very successful venture.
    Frank Harris had generously given me one of the best stories he ever wrote, &quot;The
    Magic Glasses&quot;. Fuller had contributed a gargantuan preface to <em>The Temple of Solomon the King</em></a> (the title of
    the story of my magical career), a series of sublimely eloquent rhapsodies descriptive of
    the various possible attitudes towards existence. There were three important instructions
    in Magick; the best poem of its kind that I had so far written, &quot;The Wizard
    Way&quot;; &quot;At the Fork of the Roads&quot;, a true and fascinating story of one of my
    early magical experiences; The Soldier and the Hunchback !
    and ?</a> which I still think one of the subtlest analyses that has ever been written on
    ontology, with its conclusion: that ecstatic affirmation and sceptical negation are
    neither of them valid in themselves but are alternate terms in an infinite series, a
    progression which is in itself a sublime and delightful path to pursue. Disappointment
    arises from the fear that every joy is transient. If we accept it as such and delight to
    destroy our own ideals in the faith that the very act of destruction will encourage us to
    rebuild a nobler and loftier temple from the debris of the old, each phase of our progress
    will be increasingly pleasant. &quot;pi alpha mu phi alpha gamma epsilon pi alpha gamma
    gamma epsilon nu epsilon tau omega rho &quot;, &quot;All devouerer, all begetter&quot;, is
    the praise of Pan.</p>
    <p>In us the will to live and the will to die should be equally strong and free, should be
    recognized as complements of each other, neither complete in itself; and the antithesis
    between them a device invented for our own amusement. All energy implies vibration. Man is
    miserable in the last analysis because he fancies that when what gives him pleasure is
    destroyed, as he knows it must be sooner or later, the loss is irreparable; so he shores
    up his crumbling walls instead of building himself a better house. We all cling to outworn
    customs of every kind and lie to ourselves about love when we know in our hearts that
    there is no more oil in the lamp, and that the best thing we can do is to look for a new
    one. We are afraid to lose whatever we have. We have not the sense to see that whatever it
    may be, it is bound to go sooner or later, that when it does its place will be filled by
    something just as good, and nothing is more stupid than to try to set back the sun upon
    the dial of Ahaz.</p>
    <p>As soon as we learn that everything is only half, that it implies its opposite, we can
    let ourselves go with a light heart, finding just as much fun in the red leaves of autumn
    as in the green leaves of spring. What is interesting is the complete cycle. Life itself
    would be deplorably petty were it not consecrated by the fact of its incomprehensibility
    and dignified by the certainty that however petty, futile, baroque and contemptible its
    career may</p>
    <p>{603}</p>
    <p>be, it must close in the sublime sacrament of death. As it is written in <em>The Book
    of the Law</em>, &quot;-death is the crown of all.&quot;</p>
    <p>The supplement to the first number of <em>The
    Equinox</em></a> is a plain reprint of my Magical Record in Paris, mentioned above. I have
    omitted no detail of my doings. My dinners, my dalliance and my other diversions are
    described as minutely as my Magick, my mantras and my meditations. Nothing of the sort had
    ever been published before. It is a complete demonstration of the possibility of achieving
    the most colossal results in conditions which had hitherto been considered an absolute bar
    to carrying on even elementary work. It proves my proposition that the efficacy of
    traditional practices is independent of dogmatic and ethical considerations; and,
    moreover, that my sceptical formulae based on a purely agnostic viewpoint, and on the
    facts of physiology and psychology, as understood by modern materialists, were entirely
    efficacious.</p>
    <p>In summary, let me add that <em>The Equinox</em></a>
    was the first serious attempt to put before the public the facts of occult science,
    so-called, since Blavatsky's unscholarly hotch-poch of fact and fable, <em>Isis Unveiled</em>.
    It was the first attempt in history to treat the subject with scholarship and from the
    standpoint of science. No previous book of its kind can compare with it for the perfection
    of its poetry and prose; the dignity and sublimity of its style, and the rigidity of its
    rule never to make any statement which could not be proved as precisely as the
    mathematician exacts. I confess to being entirely proud of having inaugurated an epoch.
    From the moment of its appearance, it imposed its standards of sincerity, scholarship,
    scientific seriousness and aristocracy of all kinds, from the excellence of its English to
    the perfection of its printing, upon everyone with ambition to enter this field of
    literature.</p>
    <p>It did not command a large public, but its influence has been enormous. It is
    recognized as the standard publication of its kind, as encyclopedia without &quot;equal,
    son, or companion&quot;. It has been quoted, copied and imitated everywhere. Innumerable
    cults have been founded by charlatans on its information. Its influence has changed the
    whole current of thought of students all over the world. Its inveterate enemies are not
    only unable to ignore it, but submit themselves to its sovereignty. It was thus entirely
    successful from my personal point of view. I had put a pearl of great price in a shop
    window, whose other exhibits were pasted diamonds and bits of coloured glass for the most
    part, and at best, precious stones of the cheaper and commoner kind. From the moment of
    its appearance, everyone had to admit --- for the most part with hatred and envy in their
    hearts --- that the sun had appeared in the slum and put to shame the dips and kerosene
    lamps which had lighted it till then. It was no longer possible to carry on
    hole-in-the-corner charlatanism as heretofore.</p>
    <p>I printed only one thousand and fifty copies, the odd fifty being bound</p>
    <p>{604}</p>
    <p>subscription copies at a guinea, and the rest in boards at five shillings. Had I sold a
    complete edition straight out without any discounts my return would thus have been three
    hundred pounds. The cost of production was nearer four hundred. Similar figures apply to
    the other nine numbers. In this way I satisfied myself that no one could reproach me with
    trying to make money out of Magick. As a matter of fact, it went utterly against the grain
    to take money at all. When anyone showed interest in my poetry or my magical writings, the
    attitude so delighted me that I felt it utterly shameful to have any kind of commercial
    transaction with so noble an individual, and I used, as often as not, to beg him to accept
    the book as a present.</p>
    <p>My feeling about accepting money is even more general than this; it rasps every
    delicate nerve. I feel that the world owes me a handsome income and I have no shame
    whatever in taking it, provided it is a sort of tribute. The fortune I had inherited was
    perfectly all right and it never occurred to me to inquire into its sources. <em>Widowers'
    Houses</em> shocked without convincing me. Thinking it over, I suppose fraud and robbery <em>are</em>
    the only two sources of wealth, bar exceptional cases; and I suppose that after all the
    most honest and most honourable way of getting money is to sell one's writings.</p>
    <p>Yet I still feel there is something very wrong about it. Good work is priceless and bad
    work is worthless. Besides, even the best writers are tempted to do their worst work by
    the fact that publishers, as a class, are persuaded that the public prefer rubbish. The
    fact is that there are hardly half a dozen writers in England today who have not sold out
    to the enemy. Even when their good work has been a success, Mammon grips them and
    whispers, &quot;More money for more work.&quot; One ought to have an independent income or
    another profession. There is hardly one first-rate writer in the last century who has not
    been starved, persecuted, slandered, bullied, exiled, imprisoned or driven to drink or
    drowning. </p>
    <p>To return to <em>The Equinox</em></a>, there was no
    question of selling even that small edition even at that pitiful price. I have never had
    any idea of how to do business. I can make plans, both sound and brilliant; but I cannot
    force myself to take the necessary steps to put them into practice. My greatest weakness
    is that as soon as I am sure that I can attain any given object, from climbing a mountain
    to exploiting a beauty spot, I lose interest. The only things I complete are those of
    which (as for instance, poetry and Magick) I am not the real author but an instrument
    impelled by a mysterious power which sweeps me away in effortless enthusiasm which leaves
    no room for my laziness, cynicism and similar inhibiting qualities to interfere.</p>
    <p>I did try to get a few booksellers to stock <em>The
    Equinox</em></a> but found myself immediately up against a blank wall of what I must call
    Chinese conventionality. I remember hearing of an engineer in the East who wanted to</p>
    <p>{605}</p>
    <p>built himself a house and employed a Chinese contractor. He pointed out that the work
    would be much easier by using bricks of a different size to that which the man was making.
    He obeyed, but a day later went back to the old kind. The engineer protested, but the man
    explained that his bricks were of a &quot;heaven-sent&quot; size<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>So I found that the format of <em>The Equinox</em></a>
    shocked the bookseller; worse still, it was not a book, being issued periodically, nor a
    magazine, being to big and well produced! I said, &quot;What does it matter? All I ask you
    to do is to show it and sell it.&quot; Quite useless<strong>2</strong>.</p>
    <p>I spent my spare time in the summer, for the most part, with frivolous friends in the
    Thames valley. I sorely needed just that sort of relaxation. My soul was badly bruised by
    the ruin of my romance, but I had a good time of a sort. At least, one of my friends was
    the most amusing person in his peculiar way that ever met. I must tell one incident, very
    instructive, as showing the ravages which can be wrought by strong sexuality in an
    unbalanced mind which, on the one hand, cannot control it and, on the other, fears it and
    thinks it should be suppressed.</p>
    <p>My friend, &quot;Gnaggs&quot; we will call him, had just been divorced from a trained
    nurse, the woman in the case being a plump, pretty piece of pink of the barmaid type, whom
    he then married. &quot;Gnaggs&quot; thought his first duty was to safeguard the morals of
    the woman who had just divorced him! She was living in a block of flats near Hyde Park.
    Someone was sending him anonymous letters about her. One evening he joined our party ---
    his wife and a few others --- when we came in from the river to dine at the Ray Mead
    Hotel. He had just received another letter, which said plainly that some man was going to
    be at his first wife's flat that night. He rushed up to London.</p>
    <p>When not clamouring for chastity in language which would have seemed to Savonarola
    violent and extreme, Gnaggs exhorted his wife to enjoy herself with any man she fancied.
    Neuburg was engaged in a furious flirtation with her, and he and I went back to Gnaggs's
    house with Mrs. G. and my own inamorata. Neuburg wanted to stay the night; and his
    hostess, who was very drunk, was a greedy as he was. But I was warned by a heavenly
    vision. I felt it in the marrow of my bones that a storm was brewing. I put my foot down;
    and though I almost had to use main force to get Neuburg to go home, I had my way. I was
    still talking to my own friend at half-past two, when I heard the click of the garden gate
    and steps on the path. The house door opened and shut with sinister softness. There there
    was absolute silence.</p>
    <p>A few minutes later there was a frightened scream from Mrs. Gnaggs. I threw on a
    dressing gown and went out. She was standing in a kimono on<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: This is a typical misunderstanding (by Crowley and the
        Engineer, not the Chinese contractor!). China has had standards of weights, materials and
        money for a very long time. These standards were set by imperial edict, and when
        originally propagated had penalties for violation up to and including death by torture. In
        plain words, when the Engineer demanded a change from the official standard, he coerced a
        violation of the law. The contractor attempted to explain by saying that the size of the
        bricks was a matter of ancient imperial law = &quot;from the Jade Emperor, or spirit of
        the past Emperors, in Heaven&quot;.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Possibly for the same reasons as the Chinese brick of the
        previous note. Most countries have very different laws governing the sales and
        distribution of periodicals over books. For example, in the USA a periodical is not
        subject to sales tax, has a different postal rate and has provisions of constitutional
        protection quite different from those of a book. Very likely this became a question of
        what laws to follow, not one of social confusion but rather conflicting statute.</font></li>

    <p>the landing with a candle, in hysterics, leaning over the balustrade and calling to
    know who was there. I said, &quot;It is only some beastly burglar,&quot; took the candle
    and went down. No one in the hall. In the dining-room, in pitch darkness, Gnaggs was
    standing, trembling, as white as a fish's belly. I lit up, called upstairs that all was
    well, and told him he had no business to frighten his wife. He seemed incapable of speech.
    I got him a drink and he gradually pulled himself together. We started to smoke and he
    told me his story.</p>
    <p>He had left his bicycle on the kerb some fifty yards from the entrance to the house
    where his first wife lived and waited in the shadow for her lover to come out. The man
    appeared about one o'clock. Gnaggs instantly fell on him, left him for dead on the
    pavement, sprinted to his machine and raced home. I congratulated him on his
    resourcefulness in making life interesting and got him to go to bed. He was a good deal
    scared about the police, in case he had killed the man. We watched the papers anxiously.</p>
    <p>The next day a paragraph appeared.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mysterious midnight assault near Hyde Part. Dr. Herpes-Zoster<strong>1</strong>, a
      prominent physician of Clyster Street, was assaulted brutally, and battered by a thug at
      the door of 606 Mercury Mansions, Iodine Street, Hyde Park, about one o'clock this
      morning. He was discovered unconscious by the policemen on the beat and taken to Knocks
      Hospital, where he was found to be suffering from numerous contusions and serious internal
      injuries. He had not been robbed and can assign no motive for the attack, as he is not
      aware that he has any enemies. He had been spending a quiet evening with some old friends.
      Professor and Mrs. Phthisis.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Once more I congratulated Gnaggs and this time quite sincerely. It was certainly quite
    improbable that the police would get on his trail, as his victim was an utter stranger, as
    much to his first wife as to himself!</p>
    <p>I found this sort of thing added a spice to life. Gnaggs could be relied upon to take
    one out of the rut every few minutes. Some weeks later I went to spend the weekend with
    him. I was worn out with worry and work and had caught a bad chill. He was out when I got
    to the house. Mrs. Gnaggs saw that I was really ill and made me lie down on the sofa in
    the combination smoking-room and conservatory, and went to get shawls to cover me up. As
    she bent over me to arrange them, the door opened and Ganggs walked in with his eternal
    bicycle. He jumped to the false conclusion that she was kissing me -- (God forbid!) ---
    and started a row. I was really too ill to do more than look on lazily, with amused
    contempt; but after half an hour of recriminations, Gnaggs went out to telegraph to her
    father, his lawyer and several possible allies. She followed him out.</p>
    <p>{607}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Another artificial name, this time based on that dread but
        largely trivial eruptive inflammation. The remaining names are suggestive as well:
        &quot;Clyster&quot; = enema. Mercury and Iodine were then used to treat sexual and skin
        diseases. &quot;Hyde&quot; can be taken as a pun for hidding = a beating or for skin.
        &quot;Knocks&quot; = blows. &quot;Phthisis&quot; = a wasting disease. &quot;Gnaggs&quot;
        of course is a pun for &quot;nags&quot;.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Two minutes later I heard her scream for help. I ran out and found that he had got her
    by the throat. On seeing me he let her go; she ran screaming into the house. He followed,
    swearing to kill her. I made a beeline for the drawing-room poker, but the room was so
    full of trumpery ornaments that there was no room to swing it. So we clinched. We fought
    our way to the hall. I finally got him down on the staircase. He kicked the balustrade to
    splinters; but I held on. Luckily, his hair was very long, so that I could knock his head
    on the edge of a stair whenever he tried to break away. I begged Mrs Gnaggs and the
    servants to send for help, but they were much too interested in watching the scrap. I had
    to hold him down for an hour and a half when another guest turned up and restored peace.</p>
    <p>We sat down to dinner perfectly good friends. On second thoughts he realized that his
    suspicions had been absurd. But his wife got hot as he got cool. During the meal she tried
    to kill him, first by throwing the soup tureen and a few dishes at him across the table,
    and secondly with the carving knife. It was one of the most delightful dinners I ever ate.</p>
    <p>The story has no sequel.</p>
    <p>They squabbled and scrapped and scratched for some years, and then went, first to
    Canada, then to California, and squabbled and scratched some more. They are back in
    England now, separated most of the time, and only meeting when they feel they would like
    to squabble and scrap and scratch some more. He is madder than ever, and she has developed
    into a large lump of dough. She has caught his complaint, and divides her time between
    drunken orgies with any loose fish she can find, and passionate protestations that she is
    utterly pure.</p>
    <p>I really believe she persuades herself that the other half of her life does not exist.
    To me both extremes seem equally the debauches of an unbalanced and uncontrolled
    emotionalism. This view is confirmed by the fact that as she advanced in flabbiness, fat
    and the forties, she found it harder to attract men, and took to spasms of spiritualism.
    She raves about her &quot;Guides&quot; and explains the most natural events of life as
    parts of various portentous plans prepared by people &quot;from the other side&quot;.</p>
    <p>On August 22nd the spirit suddenly sprang up in my soul like a serpent and bade me
    testify to the truth that was in me in poetry. I knew London would stifle me and rushed
    down to Maidenhead. I spent three days in a canoe, chiefly in the reach under the wier by
    Boulter's Lock.</p>

    <p>It was given me during these days to experience fully once more every incident in my
    initiation, so that I might describe them while still white-hot with their wonder. It is
    this that assures me that this poem is unique of its kind. Its only rival is the <em>Bhagavad-Gita</em>,
    which, despite its prolixity, confines its ardour to Vishvarupa-darshana. Apart from this,
    it treats of Hindu dogma and ethics. At its best, it is a sectarian work. &quot;Aha!</a>&quot; covers all religious experience, asserts no
    axioms, advocates no cut-and-dried codes. In some</p>
    <p>{609}</p>
    <p>eleven hundred lines I have described all the principal trances, from the three types
    of Dhyana (Sun, Moon, Agni) and the four elements (for instance, the Disc &quot;like a
    black boundless diamond whirring with millions of wings&quot;), to the spiritual beings
    that inhabit the invisible universe, and the Samadhic Trances, Atmadarshana and
    Shivadarshana.</p>
    <p>I have also described the moral and intellectual phenomena of initiation and indicated
    the main principles on which the aspirant should base his working. The Knowledge and
    Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel comes as the climax to these triumphs. It is
    significant that I proceed from this point instantly to declare the Law of Thelema, and
    give a dithyrambic epitome of the three chapters of the Book. I say distinctly that this
    message to mankind is to be identified with the Word of my Holy Guardian Angel. It is only
    as I write this that I realize that the poet in me perceived that Aiwaz and mine Angel
    were one. Till this moment I believed that I had reached this conclusion after many months
    of meditation in the last three years and accepted it provisionally with the greatest
    hesitation.</p>
    <p>This psychological paradox, by the way, is very frequent. Again and again I have made
    important discoveries with tedious toil only to remember, in the hour of triumph, that I
    had written them down years earlier. It seems that I do not know what I am writing, or
    even understand what I have written.</p>
    <p>The poem ends with &quot;Blessing and worship to the Beast, the prophet of the Lovely
    Star&quot;. Henceforth I must be no more an aspirant, no more an adept, no more aught that
    I could think of as myself. I was the chosen prophet of the Masters, the instrument fit to
    interpret their idea and work their will. I cannot say whether I realized this
    identification of myself with the messenger of the Masters, this resolution of my complex
    equation into a simple expression, in which the <em>x</em> of my individuality was
    eliminated, made it possible for the Secret Chiefs to initiate me fully as a Master of the
    Temple, three years since my prudent refusal to accept it. </p>
