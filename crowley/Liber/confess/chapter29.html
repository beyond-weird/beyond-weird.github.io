    <p>The general idea of Eastern religions is that any manifestation of being is necessarily
    imperfect, since it is not the sum of all truth. (For, if it were, it would not be
    distinguishable from any other manifestation). Hence, its nature is evil and its effect on
    the mind to create sorrow. Their idea is to destroy all thought as being false and
    painful. Their idea is liberation from the illusion of existence. The effect of Samadhi is
    firstly to produce the bliss which comes from the relief from pain. Later, this bliss
    disappears and one attains perfect indifference.</p>
    <p>But we need not go so far into their philosophy or accept it. Thanks partly to William
    James' <em>Varieties of Religious Experience</em>, I got the idea ofemploying the methods
    of Yoga to produce genius at will. James points out that various religious teachers
    attained their power to influence mankind in hat is essentially the same way; that is, by
    getting into Samadhi. The trance gives supreme spiritual energy and absolute
    self-confidence; it removes the normal inhibitions to action. I propose then that any man
    should use this power to develop his faculties and inspire his ambitions by directing the
    effects of the trance into the channel of his career. This idea at once connects mysticism
    with Magick; for one of the principal operations of Magick is to invoke the god
    appropriate to the thing you want, identify yourself with Him and flood your work with His
    immaculate impulse. This is, in fact, to make Samadhi with that God. The two processes are
    essentially identical; the apparent difference arises merely from the distinction between
    the European and Asiatic conceptions of the cosmos. Most European religion, including
    orthodox Judaism, is anthropomorphic, an expansion of the moral ideas connected with the
    members of a family. Asiatic religions<strong>1</strong>, even when superficially
    theistic, always imply an impersonal universe. One idealized human forces; the other, the
    forces of nature.</p>
    <p>The diary describing my practices had been printed in <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, no. IV</a>. It is very fortunate that it should
    have been kept in such detail, for it is a matter for surprise that such progress should
    have been made in so short a time. But I started with several great advantages: youth,
    indomitable determination to devote every energy to the work, a technical training under
    Eckenstein, and the constant presence of one to whom I could immediately submit any issue
    that might arise.</p>
    <p>It is unnecessary to describe in detail the results of these practices. Some of</p>
    <p>{244}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Including the oldest Greek religion in its best aspects.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>them, interesting and perhaps important in themselves, do not mean much to the layman.
    It will be well, nevertheless, to indicate some of the major phenomena.</p>
    <p>One soon obtains new conception of one's own mind. Till one has practised, one has no
    idea of the actual contents. The fact is that the uninitiate is aware only of the
    solutions of his mental equations; he is not conscious of the rough working. Further, he
    does not feel the actual impression made by each individual impact upon the mind. He
    totally mistakes its character, which is, in reality, arbitrary and imperative. The first
    analysis shows it as out of relation with its predecessors and successors. Later on, one
    discovers the subconscious links which join the elements. This process of subdivision
    seems as if it might be continued indefinitely.</p>
    <p>I will try and make matters clearer by an illustration. The normal man looking form the
    top of the Jungfrau sees Monta Rosa, the Matterhorn, the Dent Blanche and other high
    peaks, all the way to Mont Blanc, sticking up out of the morning mists. The appear to him
    isolated phenomena. The mists clear and he becomes aware that these peaks are the summits
    of a range; they are joined by a ridge rising to lesser peaks and falling to passes. But
    these secondary irregularities are themselves based on smaller ones, and even on a level
    glacier on finds that the surface is not uniform; each separate crystal of snow may be
    further examined and we hind even in it an arrangement of elements salient and re-entrant,
    which is comparable to the original macroscopic view. Acquaintance with this phenomenon
    leads one to inquire into the ultimate nature of the atoms of thought. Each atom assumes
    an importance equal to that of the others. One's sense of values is completely destroyed.</p>
    <p>There is also the problem: how is it that one's idea of a horse, for example, should be
    composed of a set of ideas, none of which have any apparent relation with it, exactly as
    the word horse itself is composed of the letters h-o-r-s-e, none of which, by itself,
    suggests a horse, or part of one, in any way? Similarly, a lump of sugar is not merely a
    mass of homogeneous crystals, but each crystal is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,
    elements which in themselves possess none of the characteristic qualities of sugar. One
    perceives that mental and physical phenomena share this irrationality.</p>
    <p>It will be seen from the above remarks that a very superficial investigation of thought
    leads inevitably to the most revolutionary consequences. At this time, however, I was not
    sufficiently advanced to perceive the full implications of these discoveries. My record
    contents itself with noting the mere symptoms produced by the practices. Even before
    leaving Colombo, I had heard the astral bell, to which so much factitious importance has
    been given. I had also purified what are called the Nadi. My complexion</p>
    <p>{245}</p>
    <p>became strangely clear; my voice had lost the harsh timbre natural to it; my appearance
    had become calm; my eyes unusually bright; and I was constantly conscious of what is
    called the Nada, which is a sound the character of which varies considerably, but in my
    case most frequently resembled the twittering of nightingales.</p>
    <p>Pranayama produced, firstly, a peculiar kind of perspiration; secondly, an automatic
    rigidity of the muscles; and thirdly, the very curious phenomenon of causing the body,
    while still absolutely rigid, to take little hops in various directions. It seems as if
    one were somehow raised, possibly an inch fro the ground, and deposited very gently a
    short distance away.</p>
    <p>I saw a very striking case of this at Kandy. When Allan was mediating, it was my duty
    to bring his food very quietly (from time to time) into the room adjoining that where he
    was working. One day he missed two successive meals and I thought I ought to look into his
    room to see if all was well. I must explain that I have known only two European women and
    three European men who could sit in the attitude called Padmasana, which is that usually
    seen in seated images of the Buddha. Of these men, Allan was one. He could knot his legs
    so well that, putting his hands on the ground, he could swing his body to and fro in the
    air between them. When I looked into his room I found him, not seated on his meditation
    mat, which was in the centre of the room at the end farthest from the window, but in a
    distant corner ten or twelve feet off, still in his knotted position, resting on his head
    and right shoulder, exactly like an image overturned. I set him right way up and he came
    out of this trance. He was quite unconscious that anything unusual had happened. But he
    had evidently been thrown there by the mysterious forces generated by Pranayama.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt whatever about this phenomenon; it is quite common. But the yogis
    claim that the lateral motion is due to lack of balance and that if one were in perfect
    equilibrium one would rise directly in the air. I have never seen any case of levitation
    and hesitate to say that it has happened to me, though I have actually been seen by others
    on several occasions apparently poised in the air. For the first three phenomena I have
    found no difficulty in devising quite simple physiological explanations. But I can form no
    theory as to how the practice could counteract the force of gravitation, and I am
    unregenerate enough to allow this to make me sceptical about the occurrence of levitation.
    Yet, after all, the stars are suspended in space. There is no a priori reason why the
    forces which prevent them rushing together should not come into operation in respect of
    the earth and the body.</p>
    <p>Again, you can prevent things from biting you by certain breathing exercises. Hold the
    breath in such a way that the body becomes spasmodically rigid, and insects cannot pierce
    the skin. Near my bungalow at Kandy was a waterfall with a pool. Allan Bennett</a> used to feed the leeches every morning.</p>
    <p>{246}</p>
    <p>At any moment he could stop the leech, though already fastened to his wrist, by this
    breathing trick. We would put our hands together into the water; his would come out free,
    mine with a dozen leeches on it. At such moments I would bitterly remark that a coyote
    will not eat a dead Mexican; but it failed to annoy him.</p>
    <p>On the shores of the lake stands a charmingly situated hotel. We used occasionally to
    go down there for a meal. It is some distance by road, so I used to take the short cut
    through the jungle. One day I had run down the hill at the top of my speed in my mountain
    boots, followed by a breathless servant. He arrived at the hotel ten minutes later with a
    dead cobra, four feet eight inches in length. I had come down with my heel right on his
    neck and never noticed it!</p>
    <p>Asana was for a long time extremely painful. It sometimes cost me five minutes' acute
    agony to straighten my limbs at the end of the practice. But success came at last. Quite
    suddenly I lost consciousness of my body. The effect was that of relief from
    long-continued suffering. Until that moment I had thought of my Asana as the one really
    painful position. This idea was reversed; it became the only position in which I was free
    from bodily discomfort. To this day, though shamefully out of practice, I am able to
    obtain the benefit of a long rest by assuming the position for a few minutes.</p>
    <p>The phenomena of concentration are very varied and curious. For instance, the
    suppression of one's normal thoughts leads to their being replaced, not only by their
    elements, as explained above, but by long forgotten memories of childhood. There are also
    what I have called &quot;atmospherics&quot;. For instance, a voice is suddenly heard,
    &quot;And if you're passing, won't you?&quot; or &quot;And not take the first step on
    virtue's giddy road.&quot; One of the entries on September 6th is worth quoting verbatim:</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" cellpadding="3">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p align="center">10:45-10:55<br>
        P.M. P.M.</td>
        <td>Dharana on tip of nose. I obtained a clear understanding of the unreality of that
        nose. This persists. An hour later whilst breathing on my arm as I was asleep, I said to
        myself, &quot;What is this hot breath from?&quot; I was forced to <em>think</em> before I
        could answer &quot;my nose&quot;. Then I pinched myself and remembered at once; but again
        breathing, the same thing happened again. Therefore the&quot;Dharanization&quot; of my
        nose dividualizes me and my nose, affects my nose, disproves my nose, abolishes,
        annihilates and expunges my nose.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p>I was very alarmed one day to find that I had completely lost the object
    of concentration. I could not think what I wished to find or where to find it. I naturally
    thought something was very wrong. Here was an occasion when Allan's experience proved
    invaluable. Without it, I might have been</p>
    <p>{247}</p>
    <p>frightened into giving up the practice. But he told me the result was good, showing
    that I was approaching the state of what is called &quot;neighbourhood
    concentration&quot;.</p>
    <p>Another experience was this: I found myself at one and thee same moment conscious of
    external things in the background after the object of my concentration had vanished, and
    also conscious that I was <em>not</em> conscious of these things. To the normal mind this
    is of course sheer contradiction, but Buddhist psychology mentions this peculiar state.
    The higher faculties of the intelligence are not subject to the same laws as the lower.</p>
    <p>I continually increased the number of hours which I devoted to my work. On October 2nd,
    to my amazement, I was successful in reaching the state of Dhyana. The experience was
    repeated on the following day. I quote the record verbatim:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>After some eight hours' discipline by Pranayama arose &quot;the Golden Dawn&quot;.</p>
      <p>While meditating, suddenly I became conscious of a shoreless space of darkness and a
      glow of crimson athwart it. Deepening and brightening, scarred by dull bars of slate-blue
      cloud, arose the Dawn of Dawns. In splendour not of earth and its mean sun, blood-red,
      rayless, adamant, it rose, it rose! Carried out of myself, I asked not &quot;Who is the
      witness?&quot; absorbed utterly in contemplation of so stupendous and so marvellous a
      fact. For there was no doubt, no change, no wavering; infinitely more real than aught
      physical is the Golden Dawn of this Eternal Sun! But ere the Orb of Glory rose clear of
      its banks of blackness --- alas my soul! --- that Light Ineffable was withdrawn beneath
      the falling veil of darkness, and in purples and greys glorious beyond imaging, sad beyond
      conceiving, faded the superb Herald of the Day. But mine eyes have seen it! And this,
      then, is Dhyana! Whit it, yet all but unremarked, came a melody as of the sweet-souled
      Vina.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Next day:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Again, by the grace Ineffable of Bhavani to the meanest of Her devotees, arose the
      Splendour of the Inner Sun. As bidden by my guru, I saluted the Dawn with Pranava. This,
      as I foresaw, retained the Dhyanic consciousness. The Disk grew golden; rose clear of all
      its clouds, flinging great fleecy cumuli of rose and gold, fiery with light, into the
      aethyr of space. Hollow it seemed and rayless as the Sun in Sagittarius, yet incomparably
      brighter: but rising clear of cloud, it began to revolve, to coruscate, to throw off
      streamers of jetted fire! (This from a hill-top I held, dark as of a dying world. Covered
      with black decayed wet peaty wood, a few pines stood stricken,</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{248}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>unutterably alone.) (Note. This is a mere thought form induced by misunderstanding the
      instruction of Mâitrânanda Swami as to observing the phenomenon.) But behind the glory
      of its coruscations seemed to shape an idea, less solid than a shadow! an Idea of some
      Human seeming Form! Now grew doubt and thought in P's miserable mind; and the one Wave
      grew many waves and all was lost! Alas! Alas! for P! And Glory Eternal unto Her, She the
      twin-Brested that hath encroached even upon the other half of the Destroyer! &quot;OM Namo
      Bhâvaniya OM.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The result of this attainment was what I should least have expected. I was not
    encouraged to proceed; it seemed as if I had used up the accumulated energy of years. I
    found it impossible to force myself to continue. It was nearly two years before I resumed
    any regular practice.</p>
    <p>The immediate current being thus exhausted, we decided to go on a pilgrimage to the
    ruined sacred cities of Buddhism. Allan had become more and more convinced that he ought
    to take the Yellow Robe. The phenomena of Dhyana and Samadhi had ceased to exercise their
    first fascination. It seemed to him that they were insidious obstacles to true spiritual
    progress; that their occurrence, in reality, broke up the control of the mind which he was
    trying toe establish and prevented him from reaching the ultimate truth which he sought.
    He had the strength of mind to resist the appeal of even these intense spiritual joys.
    Like physical love, they persuade their dupe to put up with the essential evil of
    existence.</p>
    <p>As for myself, I had become impatient with the whole business. Dhyana had washed my
    brain completely out. I went on this pilgrimage in a entirely worldly frame of mind. My
    interests were in aesthetic, historical and ethnological matters, and in incidents of
    travel amid new scenes. I even took a somewhat demoniac delight in sceptical and
    scurrilous comment upon current events for the sheer joy of shocking Allan, and even in
    horrifying him by occasional excursions after big game. I may as well go back a little in
    time and record my general impressions of Ceylon as a man of the world, in connected
    sequence.</p>
    <p>I was as full of romantic folly about the wisdom of the East, and the splendours and
    luxuries of Asia, as I had been about Jacobites. But already I had learnt to use my eyes;
    prejudices had somehow lost their power to persuade. My experience of the Order probably
    counted for a good deal in this. At the same time, I did not swing from one extreme to the
    other. &quot;Blessed are they that expect nothing; for they shall not be
    disappointed!&quot; I was in no danger of judging the principles of Buddhism by the
    practices of Buddhists. I worked out the logical consequences of any philosophy without
    reference to the criticisms of history. The Buddhism of Ceylon is</p>
    <p>{249}</p>
    <p>based on the canon of their scriptures. But the customs of the people have been for the
    most part adapted to the new religion; very much as paganism persisted unchanged, except
    as to terminology, when it was camouflaged by Christianity; just as the ass of Priapus
    became the ass of the Nativity; as Jupiter became Jehovah; Isis, Mary; and so on; as the
    crown of Osiris developed into the papal tiara; as the feats of corn and wine were resumed
    in the Eucharist, so did the old rites of fetish and ancestor worship continue under new
    names. The old demonology was adapted to Buddhist theories.</p>
    <p>The primitive instincts of people are ineradicable; their passions and fears always
    find approximately the same expression, despite the efforts of philosophers and religious
    reformers. So I was neither surprised nor shocked (as was the more ingenuous Allan) at the
    devil dances and similar superstitious practices which pretended to be a part in the pure
    rational and straightforward spirituality of Buddhism. The very simplicity and savagery of
    these practices were pleasing. The enthusiasm was sincere; there was no hypocrisy, no
    humbug, no sanctimoniousness, no protestations of virtue or assumptions of superiority.</p>
    <p>The supreme glory of Kandy is an alleged tooth of the Buddha. It is enclosed in seven
    concentric caskets, some of which are enormously valuable and beautiful. Gold an jewels
    are nothing accounted of. Some years before my visit, one of these caskets had been
    stolen. The King of Siam provided a new one at the cost of an incredible number of lakhs
    of rupees. He made a journey to Kandy with his retinue in great pomp to make the
    presentation in person and the priests refused to allow him to see the tooth! It was a
    magnificent piece of impudence --- of of policy. My own Unpretentious Holiness met with
    better fortune. Allan and I were permitted to be present at the annual inspection by the
    trustees. I believe the tooth to be that of a dog or crocodile, but though I got an
    excellent view at close quarters, I am not anatomist enough to be positive. I am, however,
    quite certain that it is not a human tooth.</p>
    <p>Homage is paid to this relic every year at a ceremony called the Perahera. I was not
    impressed by the sanctity of the proceedings; but as a spectacle it is certainly gorgeous.
    The very wildness and lack of appropriateness add to its charm. The processions to which
    we are accustomed in Europe and America are all so cleverly though out that the effect is
    merely to irritate. The Perahera is a gigantic jollification; they bring out all their
    elephants, dancers, monks, officials, drums, horns, torches --- anything that makes a
    blaze of a noise, and let them all loose at once. The effect is of impromptu excitement.
    Poor, serious, single-minded Allan, with his whole soul set on alleviating the sufferings
    of humanity and helping them to reach a higher plane of existence, was saddened and
    disillusioned.</p>
    <p>One incident was somewhat scandalously amusing. He was doing his</p>
    <p>{250}</p>
    <p>best to enter into the spirit of the thing and called my attention to the &quot;strains
    of wild oriental music&quot;. I knew better. I had read Herrick's poem abut the young lady
    who left a glove in the royal presence, and remembered that Lady Clara de Vere de Vere has
    certain physiological properties in common with the elephant. Poor Allan was absolutely
    horrified when he realized his mistake.</p>
    <p>The scene was wild and somewhat sinister. The darkness, the palms, the mountainous
    background, the silent lake below, the impenetrable canopy of space, studded with
    secretive and significant stars, formed a stupendous setting for the savage noise and
    blaze of the ceremony. One half saw huge shadowy shapes moving mysteriously in the
    torchlight, and the air vibrated violently with the jubilant rage of riotous religious
    excitement. It communicated a sort of magnificent madness to the mind. One didn't know
    what it meant or if it meant anything particular. One was not hampered by knowledge; one
    could let oneself go. One felt a tense, tremendous impulse to do something demoniac. Yet
    one had no idea what. It put one's nerves on the rack. It was almost a torture to feel so
    intensely, and desire so deliriously, such unintelligible irritations. Hours passed in
    this intoxicating excitement. One can understand perfectly the popular enthusiasm. It was
    the release of the subconscious desires of the original animal. To a civilized mind,
    accordingly, the impression was charged with a certain disquietude partaking of the nature
    of terror without understanding why; one felt the presence of forces which appal because
    one feels their power, recognizes their existence in oneself. They are the things one has
    tried to forget and persuaded oneself that they are in fact forgotten. They are the voices
    of ancestral appetite. It is the roar of the mob in the ears of the educated: but as for
    any definite religious impression, the Perahera had nothing to say. It was no more
    Buddhism than the carnival at Nice is Christianity. Iota Omega Pi Alpha Nu !</p>
    <p>But the matter does not end there. Official science, which can always be relied upon to
    discover at last what everybody has always known, has just proclaimed the fact that
    certain states of mind possess the property of performing what used to be called miracles,
    and that such states may be evoked by the constant repetition of formulae and similar
    practices. The whole of Eastern ceremonies, from the evolutions of dancing girls to the
    austerities of ascetics, have all been devised with the intention of inducing the right
    medium for the right sort of subconsciousness to rise, move and appear.</p>
