    <p>The twenty-eighth was fine and we held a durbar. It was decided that, Eckenstein being
    ill, Pfannl, Guillarmod and I should start up the mountain. Eckenstein voted for the
    doctor, <em>qua</em> doctor, in case of one of us being ill. It shows how easy he thought
    the slopes.</p>
    <p>Wessely was very offensive in his resentment at not being included in the party. It was
    an intolerably bad piece of sportsmanship. Pfannl tended to take his side, and the pair
    made so much unpleasantness that we were soon reduced to the expedient of getting them out
    of the way as much as possible.</p>
    <p>We got everything ready; but next morning the wind was so high that we could not start.
    Even while drinking our chocolate in the cooking tent, we nearly got frostbitten. After
    sunrise, the wind dropped; but it was too late to start. Eckenstein and Knowles were both
    ill, but the rest of us went on ski nearly to the pass at the top of the glacier. About
    four o'clock in the afternoon the wind started again and once again loosened my tent. This
    time snow came driving up the valley.</p>
    <p>We had a spare tent for the use of the few natives whom we kept with us. I had gone out
    to try to refix my tabernacle at sunset --- and there was a Balti out in the snow praying
    with his face towards Mecca! The religion of the Mohammedan, unlike that of the Christian,
    is positive. It is not based on fear, but on the actual sense of the relations of man and
    God. I laugh to think of the well-fed, idle and ignorant missionary at Shigar trying to
    convert men of this stamp. Their simplicity sees through Christian sophistication at a
    glance; and, their sense of ethics being outraged as well as their sense of reverence, it
    is easy to understand that the only converts from Mohammedanism are absolutely
    conscienceless scoundrels who wish to live on the scarcely camouflaged subsidies of
    missions.</p>
    <p>The next day found me completely snow-blind. The pain is not so much severe as
    irritating. The feeling is as of having red hot sand at the back of one's eyes. One keeps
    on blinking with the idea of removing it, and of course it won't be removed. During my <em>ski-läufing</em>
    I had religiously worn goggles. My condition was due entirely to pottering about the camp
    for a few minutes in the snowstorm, fixing my tent. I got all right again in a couple of
    days. The weather was moderate on June 30th and July 1st. But from July 2nd to 6th was a
    continuous snowstorm. There was no remittance day or night. It was this which made Camp 10
    unpopular.</p>
    <p>We got rid of the Austrians on July 1st by sending them to Camp 11</p>
    <p>{316}</p>
    <p>at the corner of the north-east ridge of Chogo Ri. At this point the glacier divides
    into two large snow basins. One leads to the pass which I have named Windy Gap (21,500
    feet) on whose north-west is the mountain at the head of the valley, which I called
    Staircase Peak, from the well-marked and regular indentations of its eastern ridge. The
    other is apparently a kind of blind alley, its circus of rocks seems to have no definite
    break. It is difficult to be sure of this, for when I saw it it was always a cauldron of
    whirling mists of snow. </p>
    <p>Pfannl and Wessely had reported that the north-east ridge of K2 was climbable, and on
    Monday the seventh, which was fine, it was decided to try to ascend the mountain by that
    route. So main camp was to be moved to Camp 11. I was rather ill, but protested. The
    proposed route was in fact absurd. Camp 11 was much farther from the summit than Camp 10,
    and the proposal was to reach the shoulder by following a along and deeply indented ridge
    the wall of which is on the Chogo Lungma side, a sheer precipice of avalanche-swept
    slopes, except at the point which I had originally picked out.</p>
    <p>However, I was overruled. The doctor and I prepared to leave on the eighth. It was on
    this occasion that we discovered the incapacity of the natives to pull a sledge. It is
    about three hours' march to Camp 11. The going was not bad, though I was still rather
    sick. The weather was good enough to go out. I went a considerable distance up the slopes
    of the mountain. There is some conflict in opinion as to the height reached by various
    members of the party. Eckenstein was fanatically determined never to exaggerate any
    exploit. We made a very great number of boiling-point determinations of the heights of our
    camps; but even these are subject to various sources of error. Camp 11 is roughly 20,000
    feet; but I suspect it to be a little higher. I estimated my climbing at 21,500 feet at
    the time; but this was mostly out of respect for Eckenstein. I was his most devoted
    disciple; I would not have given him any chance to reproach me by making a statement which
    might afterwards prove an exaggeration. But my real opinion is that I reached something
    over 22,0000 feet. I could see clearly over Windy Gap; I must have been well above it. I
    would not depend on the reading of aneroids in any circumstances. We had taken three
    instruments specially constructed; they only began to register at 15,000 feet and went to
    30,000. But comparisons of the three showed --- usually --- that no two were alike.</p>
    <p>In the evening I was very ill indeed; indigestion, fever, shivering. In order to
    breathe I had to use my whole muscular strength. I was also on the point of vomiting and
    remained in this condition nearly all the night. In the morning I was a little better; my
    breathing had become normal; but I had a great deal of pain and felt very ill and weak.
    The weather was splendid.</p>
    <p>{317}</p>
    <p>Wessely and Guillarmod were encouraged to repeat my climb of the previous day; but from
    their report it is not clear whether or not they got farther than I did. I lay in the
    sunlight and rested. I noticed strange sights; a fly, a butterfly, some crows and an
    insect which I thought was a bee, but I could not be sure. All visited the camp. Later the
    camp was covered with the snow from a big avalanche from Chogo Ri. It stripped the whole
    wall of the north-east ridge; that is, it was about four miles broad.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein and Knowles came up on the eleventh. Another fine day. I was still very ill;
    my temperature 39.4° Centigrade. I did not at all realize the cause at first, simple as
    it was. The true explanation was very far-fetched in the actual sense of the word. My
    symptoms became unmistakable before long and I had to admit that I was suffering from
    malaria. The hardships of the journey had removed my physiological protection and the bug
    stated to buzz about. I was thus the proud possessor of another world's record; the only
    man who had had malaria at over twenty thousand feet! Incidentally, I was also the only
    poet at that altitude. I have always been very amused at Shelley's boast that he had
    &quot;trodden the glaciers of the Alps&quot; --- the Mer de Glace and the Glacier des
    Boissons! But I was actually writing poetry in these camps. <em>Better</em> poetry.</p>
    <p>Like the man who committed suicide when he learnt that the was unable to move his upper
    jaw, I had been annoyed by reading somewhere that it was impossible to find a rime to
    &quot;silver&quot;. I spent my spare time in thinking up all the most impossible words in
    the language, finding rimes for them --- good rimes, not mere assonances --- and
    introducing them into &quot;Ascension Day&quot; and &quot;Pentecost&quot;. In that poem
    will therefore be found rimes for refuge, reverence, country, virgin, courtesan,
    Euripides, Aristophanes, Aeschylus, Aischulos, Sophocles, ARistobulos, Alcibiades,
    fortress, unfashionable, sandwich, perorate, silver, bishop (eight rimes for this word),
    Sidney (three rimes for this), maniac, Leviticus, Cornelius, Abra-Melin, Brahmacharya,
    Kismet, Winchester, Christ Church, worship, Chesterton, Srotápatti (two rimes to this),
    Balliol, and so on.</p>
    <p>I have mentioned hardships. It may be interesting to mention the nature of these. The
    first and greatest was malaise, which was mostly due to lack of food and exercise. The
    latter complaint seems rather ridiculous; but it is an absolute fact. One must not bring
    damp things into the tent; if one does, it practically destroys the efficacy of one's
    protection against cold. One must therefore stay cooped up in one's tent as long as the
    weather is bad. I was in charge of the kitchen and had to go out in all sorts of weather;
    but that was hardly exercise. I often found that by the time I had filled and lighted the
    stoves and got the snow melted, I could not stand the cold any longer. I had to rush back
    to my sleeping-bag and warm up while someone else prepared the food.</p>
    <p>{318}</p>
    <p>We kept warm with kangri, of a sort, when things got too bad. We had brought up a
    number of Japanese instras, but they would not burn; there was not enough oxygen. The
    cartridges could however be used if left loose in empty biscuit tins. For a similar reason
    pipe-smoking was impossible; the only way to do it was to relight the pipe from the flame
    of the candle at each puff. We had a few cigars and we could smoke these quite
    comfortably. (It appears that the altitude is not wholly responsible for this. At greater
    heights on Kangchenjunga I smoked my pipe as comfortably as at sealevel.)</p>
    <p>This same is true about food. We found it difficult to eat anything but what may be
    called delicacies from the standpoint of people in our position. I felt a certain distaste
    for food. I had to be &quot;tempted&quot; like an invalid or a fastidious child. It became
    obvious that Eckenstein's German army theories were inapplicable to Himalayan exploration.</p>
    <p>We suffered little from cold in the acute way, but rather from a chronic effect. The
    problem of cold has not been scientifically stated by any explorer so far as I know. It is
    thus: The normal temperature of the body is 37° centigrade. If therefore the temperature
    of the air is 30° one has to make up the difference by the heat disengaged by the
    combustion of food. If the temperature is 23° one requires theoretically twice as much
    food, if 15° three times as much, if 8° our times as much, if 1° five times as much, if
    -6° six times as much, if -13° seven times as much, if -30° eight times as much. There
    temperatures are very much less hot and less cold than those actually experienced. The
    maximum and minimum thermometers proved altogether unreliable; and the observations on the
    chart refer to more or less arbitrary times. Other thermometers showed temperatures of
    over 40° and under 30° centigrade. Unfortunately, simple arithmetic is not the only
    consideration. The digestive apparatus is calculated for dealing with an amount of food
    corresponding to, I don't know what temperature, but we might say at a guess 1°. If the
    average temperature is less than this, it means that you have to eat more than you can
    digest; and that means a gradual accumulation of troubles.</p>
    <p>One can, of course, economize one's heat to some extent by diminishing the radiation;
    that is by wearing non-conducting clothes, also by supplying artificial heat from kangris
    and so on. (The kangri, by the way, is a Kashmiri device. It is a pot of copper or iron in
    which charcoal is burnt. The natives put it under their blankets and squat on it. It is
    alleged that this habit explains the great frequency of cancer of the testicles or scrotum
    in the country. The analogy is with &quot;chimneysweep's cancer&quot;.)</p>
    <p>After cancelling out all the excrescences of the equation, the situation amounts to
    this; that you cannot live permanently in conditions unsuited to your organism. It is
    pitiful to have to make statements of this kind, seeing that it is no more than a
    recapitulation of the main proposition of Darwin and</p>
    <p>{319}</p>
    <p>Spencer. But the average explorer (for some inexplicable reason) seems absolutely
    incapable of applying common sense, experience or the teaching of science to the vital
    problems with which he is posed. Here in 1922, after all our experience, we have the
    members of the Everest expedition drivelling about acclimatization, as if science did not
    exist. Norman Collie told me plainly in 1896 on his return from the Mummery expedition to
    Nanga Parbat, that the only chance of getting up a big mountain was to rush it. I knew
    Collie for a man of science and for a man of sense and experience. I trusted his
    information absolutely and I governed myself accordingly.</p>
    <p>The only thing to do is to lay in a stock of energy, get rid of all your fat at the
    exact moment when you have a change to climb a mountain, and jump back out of its reach,
    so to speak, before it can take its revenge. To talk of acclimatization is to adopt the
    psychology of the man who trained his horse gradually to live on a single straw a day, and
    would have revolutionized our system of nutrition, if the balky brute had not been
    aggravating enough to die on his hands. If you want to acclimatize yourself to mountain
    conditions, you can go and live a bit higher than the hillmen of Tibet. If you do this for
    fifteen generations or so, your descendants will acquire a thorax like a beer barrel and a
    heart capable of doing three times the work that it can at present. If you then get
    incarnated in your clan, you can lay siege to Chogo Ri with a reasonable prospect of
    success. As the hymn says,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Patience and perseverance<br>
          Made a Bishop of His Reverence.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This programme is however hardly acceptable to Western minds, so little penetrated with
    Einstein's ideas that everything has to be done in a hurry. We may therefore leave
    &quot;acclimatization&quot; to the mentally defective heroes of the Everest expedition of
    1921 and 1922. Collie was right in saying that one is living on one's capital on prolonged
    mountain expeditions. My experience enables me to add that it is not only a question of
    mountains. Any kind of prolonged hardship gradually wears one down. Again I repeat, it is
    pitiful to have to insist on such obvious truths. The low vitality of the working classes,
    the national deterioration caused by the privations of wartime, scream their warning.
    Anyone on earth except a member of the English Alpine Club would take it to heart.</p>
    <p>When I went to Kanchenjunga three years later I had got everything down to a fine
    point. I trained at Darjeeling by feeding up as much as possible (the diet at the Drum
    Druid Hotel was slow starvation), by having myself massaged by an &quot;educated&quot;
    Bengali who was a Seventh Day Adventist and stole ten pounds. I arrived at twenty-one
    thousand feet in absolute perfect condition only three weeks out from the base and
    suffered absolutely none of the conditions which were pulling us slowly to pieces on Chogo
    Ri, except</p>
    <p>{320}</p>
    <p>Wessely who, like the brute beast that he was, seemed insensible to the influence of
    hardship and was keeping himself in comfort by stealing the supplies of the expedition
    surreptitiously.</p>
    <p>We were all suffering more or less. Knowles had lost 33 of his 186 pounds; the doctor
    some 20 of this 167 since leaving Askole. A man with galloping consumption could hardly do
    better. Our haemoglobin had diminished by twenty per cent. Eckenstein was suffering from
    various complicated pulmonary troubles; Knowles and the doctor were repeatedly down with
    influenza; as for myself, the recrudescence of my malaria, which began with a violent
    liver chill on the twenty-seventy of July and lasted till the end of the month, kept my
    temperature at 39.3° or thereabouts. Pfannl, the great athlete, had a story of his own.
    (Coming soon.)</p>
    <p>Owing to the fact that snow at these altitudes evaporates without melting, it
    disappears from the neighbourhood of a tent, leaving a pinnacle where it is protected by
    the canvas. Thus, at the end of five days' snowstorm one would find oneself perched on a
    plateau some feet above the rest of the glacier. (This illustrates the formation of
    glacier tables.) It was necessary, whatever the weather might be, to shift the tent, as
    otherwise the weight of the snow on the sloping sides, and the general strain, would tear
    the canvas. We have a photograph of the plateau from which our tents had been removed
    after five days of snowstorm. In the middle of the square patch of hard snow relegated by
    pressure are two deep depressions like rude graves. These represent the ice melted by the
    warmth of our bodies through a double groundsheet of Willesden canvas, the canvas of the
    Roberts valise and the thick cork mattress.</p>
    <p>Pfannl and Wessely had become completely intolerable and we encouraged them to go off
    to Camp 12 (estimated at about 21,000 feet) on the thirteenth. The weather showed its
    usual readiness to cook up a storm. On the fourteenth I describe it as (x.o.p.)n+1. A chit
    (note) arrived saying that Pfannl was ill. On the fifteenth the weather cleared in the
    afternoon; but I could see that it meant further mischief. My diary notes that I ate a
    meal this day. I must have been pretty bad previously to make such an entry; for my diary,
    whatever its other defects, is a supreme model of the laconic style.</p>
    <p>Another chit told us that Pfannl was worse. The doctor went up to Camp 12 to look after
    him. Nemesis had come to town. Athletic training, as understood by athletes, is a
    violation of the first principles of nature. Wilkie Collins, in <em>Man and Wife</em>, had
    told me about it. A little old woman is provoked to personal conflict by the Pride of
    England and it ends by his collapsing. The same thing had happened to Pfannl. They had the
    utmost difficulty to get him down to Camp 11. This misadventure lost us our last chance of
    making a dash for K2. There was one series of two fine days, the second of which could
    have been used by Knowles and myself if we had not</p>
    <p>{321}</p>
    <p>been obliged to superintend the caravan of invalids. From the sixteenth to the
    nineteenth was an almost continuous snowstorm. Pfannl was suffering from oedema of both
    lungs and his mind was gone.</p>
    <p>A pathetic incident sticks in my mind. He sent for me to come to his tent and told me
    that these dull brutes could not understand him, but that I, as a poet, would be able to
    enter into his feelings. He then said that there were three of him; two of them were all
    right; but the third was a mountain with a dagger and he was afraid that it would stab
    him. I did not at that time realize the significance of the delusion. Today it is obvious
    that the fear and fascination of the hills had got mixed up with that of the phallus, thus
    determining the character of the symbol. As things were, I could merely report that he was
    insane, and the doctor continued the treatment of keeping him continuously under morphia.</p>
