    <p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; Not only to this
    autohagiography --- as he amusedly insists on calling it --- of Aleister Crowley, but to
    every form of biography, biology, even chemistry, these words are key.</p>
    <p>&quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; What can we know about a star? By the
    telescope, a faint phantasm of its optical value. By the spectroscope, a hint of its
    composition. By the telescope, and our mathematics, its course. In this last case we may
    legitimately argue from the known to the unknown: by our measure of the brief visible
    curve, we can calculate whence it has come and whither it will go. Experience justifies
    our assumptions.</p>
    <p>Considerations of this sort are essential to any serious attempt at biography. An
    infant is not --- as our grandmothers thought --- an arbitrary jest flung into the world
    by a cynical deity, to be saved or damned as predestination or freewill required. We know
    now that &quot;that, that is, is&quot;, as the old hermit of Prague that never saw pen and
    ink very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc.</p>
    <p>Nothing can ever be created or destroyed; and therefore the &quot;life&quot; of any
    individual must be comparable to that brief visible curve, and the object of writing it to
    divine by the proper measurements the remainder of its career.</p>
    <p>The writer of any biography must ask, in the deepest sense, who is he? This questions
    who art thou?&quot; is the first which is put to any candidate for initiation. Also, it is
    the last. What so-and-so is, did and suffered: these are merely clues to that great
    problem. So then the earliest memories of any autohagiographer will be immensely valuable;
    their very incoherence will be an infallible guide. For, as Freud has shown, we remember
    (in the main) what we wish to remember, and forget what is painful. There is thus great
    danger of deception as to the &quot;facts&quot; of the case; but our memories indicate
    with uncanny accuracy what is our true will. And, as above made manifest, it is this true
    will which shows the nature of our proper motion.</p>
    <p>In writing the life of the average man, there is this fundamental difficulty, that the
    performance is futile and meaningless, even from the standpoint of the matter-of-fact
    philosopher; there is, that is to say, no artistic unity. In the case of Aleister Crowley
    no such Boyg appeared on the hillside; for he himself regards his career as a definitely
    dramatic composition. It comes to a climax on April 8th, 9th and 10th, 1904 e.v. The
    slightest incident in the {31} History of the whole universe appears to him as a
    preparation for that event; and his subsequent life is merely the aftermath of that
    crisis. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, however, there is the circumstance that his time has been spent in
    three very distinct manners: the Secret Way of the Initiate, the Path of Poetry and
    Philosophy, and the Open Sea of Romance and Adventure. It is indeed not unusual to find
    the first two, or the last two, elements in the molecule of a man: Byron exemplifies this,
    and Poe that. But is is rare indeed for so strenuous and out-of-doors a life to be
    associated with such profound devotion to the arts of the quietist; and in this particular
    instance all three careers are so full that posterity might well be excused for surmising
    that not one but several individuals were combined in a legend, or even for taking the
    next step and saying: This Aleister Crowley was not a man, or even a number of men; he is
    obviously a solar myth. Nor could he himself deny such an impeachment too brutally; for
    already, before he has attained the prime of life, his name is associated with fables not
    less fantastic than those which have thrown doubt upon the historicity of the Buddha. It
    should be the true will of this book to make plain the truth about the man. Yet here again
    there is a lion in the way. The truth must be falsehood unless it be the whole truth; and
    the whole truth is partly inaccessible, partly unintelligible, partly incredible and
    partly unpublishable --- that is, in any country where truth in itself is recognized as a
    dangerous explosive.</p>
    <p>A further difficulty is introduced by the nature of the mind, and especially of the
    memory, of the man himself. We shall come to incidents which show that he is doubtful
    about clearly remembered circumstances, whether they belong to &quot;real life&quot; or to
    dreams, and even that he has utterly forgotten things which no normal man could forget. He
    has, moreover, so completely overcome the illusion of time (in the sense used by the
    philosophers, from Lao Tzu and Plotinus to Kant and Whitehead) that he often finds it
    impossible to disentangle events as a sequence. He has so thoroughly referred phenomena to
    a single standard that they have lost their individual significance, just as when one has
    understood the word &quot;cat&quot;, the letters c a t have lost their own value and
    become mere arbitrary elements of an idea. Further: on reviewing one's life in perspective
    the astronomical sequence ceases to be significant. Events rearrange themselves in an
    order outside time and space, just as in a picture there is no way of distinguishing at
    what point on the canvas the artist began to paint. Alas! it is impossible to make this a
    satisfactory book; hurrah! that furnishes the necessary stimulus; it becomes worth while
    to do it, and by Styx! it shall be done.</p>
    <p>It would be absurd to apologize for the form of of this book. Excuses are always
    nauseating. I do not believe for a moment that it would have turned out any better if it
    had been written in the most favourable circumstances. {32} I mention merely as a matter
    of general interest the actual difficulties attending the composition.</p>
    <p>From the start my position was precarious. I was practically penniless, I had been
    betrayed in the most shameless and senseless way by practically everyone with whom I was
    in business relations, I had no means of access to any of the normal conveniences which
    are considered essential to people engaged in such tasks. On the top of this there sprang
    up a sudden whirlwind of wanton treachery and brainless persecution, so imbecile yet so
    violent as to throw even quite sensible people off their base. I ignored this and carried
    on, but almost immediately both I and one of my principal assistants were stricken down
    with lingering illness. I carried on. My assistant died<strong>1</strong>. I carried on.
    His death was the signal for a fresh outburst of venomous falsehoods. I carried on. The
    agitation resulted in my being exiled from Italy; through no accusation of any kind was,
    or could be, alleged against me. That meant that I was torn away from even the most
    elementary conveniences for writing this book. I carried on. At the moment of writing this
    paragraph everything in connection with the book is entirely in the air. I am carrying on.</p>
    <p>But apart from any of this, I have felt throughout an essential difficulty with regard
    to the form of the book. The subject is too big to be susceptible of organic structure
    unless I make a deliberate effort of will and a strict arbitrary selection. It would, as a
    matter of fact, be easy for me to choose any one of fifty meanings for my life, and
    illustrate it by carefully chosen facts. Any such method would be open to the criticism
    which is always ready to devastate any form of idealism. I myself feel that it would be
    unfair and, what is more, untrue. The alternative has been to make the incidents as full
    as possible, to state them as they occurred, entirely regardless of any possible bearing
    upon any possible spiritual significance. This method involves a certain faith in life
    itself, that it will declare its own meaning and apportion the relative importance of
    every set of incidents automatically. In other words, it is to assert the theory that the
    destiny is a supreme artist, which is notoriously not the case on any accepted definition
    of art. And yet --- a mountain! What a mass of heterogeneous accidents determine its
    shape! Yet, in the case of a fine mountain, who denies the beauty and even the
    significance of its form?</p>
    <p>In the later years of my life, as I have attained to some understanding of the unity
    behind the diverse phenomena of experience, and as the natural restriction of elasticity
    which comes with age has gained ground, it has become progressively easier to group events
    about a central purpose. But this only means that the principle of selection has been
    changed. In my early years the actual seasons, climates and occupations determined the
    sections of my life. My spiritual activities fit into those frames, whereas, more
    recently,</p>
    <p>{33}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Raoul Loveday, who died at the Abbey of Thelema after drinking
        from a polluted stream. See part 6 of this work for the rest.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>the converse is the case. My physical environment fits into my spiritual preoccupation.
    This change would be sufficient by itself to ensure the theoretical impossibility of
    editing a life like mine on any consistent principle.</p>
    <p>I find myself obliged, for these and many other reasons, to abandon altogether any idea
    of conceiving an artistic structure for the work or formulating an artistic purpose. All
    that I can do is to describe everything that I remember, as best I can, as if it were, in
    itself, the centre of interest. I must trust nature so to order matters that, in the
    multiplicity of the material, the proper proportion will somehow appear automatically,
    just as in the operations of pure chance or inexorable law a unity ennobled by strength
    and beautified by harmony arises inscrutably out of the chaotic concatenation of
    circumstances. At least one claim may be made; nothing has been invented, nothing
    suppressed, nothing altered and nothing &quot;yellowed up&quot;. I believe that truth is
    not only stranger than fiction, but more interesting. And I have no motive for deception,
    because I don't give a damn for the whole human race --- &quot;you're nothing but a pack
    of cards.&quot;</p>

    <p>Edward Crowley<strong>1</strong>, the wealthy scion of a race of Quakers, was the
    father of a son born at 30 Clarendon Square, Leamington, Warwichshire<strong>2</strong>,
    on the 12th day of October<strong>3</strong> 1875 E.V. between eleven and twelve at night.
    Leo was just rising at the time, as nearly as can be ascertained. The branch of the family
    of Crowley to which this man belonged has been settled in England since Tudor times: in
    the days of Bad Queen Bess there was a Bishop Crowley, who wrote epigrams in the style of
    Marital. One of them --- the only one I know --- runs thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The bawds of the stews be all turnèd out:<br>
          But I think they inhabit all England throughout.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(I cannot find the modern book which quotes this as a footnote and have not been able
    to trace the original volume.)</p>
    <p>The Crowleys, are, however, of Celtic origin; the name O'Crowley is common in
    south-west Ireland, and the Breton family of de Quérouaille --- which gave England a
    Duchess of Portsmouth --- or de Kerval is of the same stock. Legend will have it that the
    then head of the family came to England with the Earl of Richmond and helped to make him
    king on Bosworth Field.</p>
    <p>Edward Crowley was educated as an engineer, but never practised his profession<strong>4</strong>.
    He was devoted to religion and became a follower of John Nelson Darby, the founder of the
    &quot;Plymouth Brethren&quot;. The fact reveals a stern logician; for the sect is
    characterized by refusal to compromise; it insists on the literal interpretation of the
    Bible as the exact words of the Holy Ghost<strong>5</strong>.</p>
    <p>He married (in 1874, one may assume) Emily Bertha Bishop, of a Devon and Somerset
    family. Her father had died and her brother Tom Bond Bishop had come to London to work in
    the Civil Service. The important points about the woman are that her schoolmates called
    her &quot;the little</p>
    <p>{35}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">&quot;the younger&quot; (1834-87).</font></li>
      <li><font size="2">It has been remarked a strange coincidence that one small county should
        have given England her two greatest poets --- for one must not forget Shakespeare
        (1550-1610).</font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Presumably this is nature's compensation for the horror which blasted
        mankind on that date in 1492.</font></li>

        dates.</font></li>

    </ol>
    <p>Chinese girl&quot;, that she painted in water-colour with admirable taste destroyed by
    academic training, and that her powerful natural instincts were suppressed by religion to
    the point that she became, after her husband's death, a brainless bigot of the most
    narrow, logical and inhuman type. Yet there was always a struggle; she was really
    distressed, almost daily, at finding herself obliged by her religion to perform acts of
    the most senseless atrocity.</p>
    <p>Her firstborn son, the aforesaid, was remarkable from the moment of his arrival. He
    bore on his body the three most important distinguishing marks of a Buddha. He was
    tongue-tied, and on the second day of his incarnation a surgeon cut the fraenum linguae.
    He had also the characteristic membrane, which necessitated an operation for phimosis some
    three lustres<strong>1</strong> later. Lastly, he had upon the centre of his heart four
    hairs curling from left to right in the exact form of a Swastika<strong>2</strong>.</p>
    <p>He was baptised by the names of Edward Alexander, the latter being the surname of an
    old friend of this father's, deeply beloved by him for the holiness of his life --- by
    Plymouth Brethren standards, one may suppose. It seems probable that the boy was deeply
    impressed by being told, at what age (before six) does not appear, that Alexander means
    &quot;helper of men&quot;. He is still giving himself passionately to the task, despite
    the intellectual cynicism inseparable from intelligence after one has reached forty.</p>
    <p>But the extraordinary fact connected with this baptismal ceremony is this. As the
    Plymouth Brethren practise infant baptism by immersion, it must have taken place in the
    first three months of his life. Yet he has a perfectly clear visual recollection of the
    scene. It took place in a bathroom on the first floor of the house in which he was born.
    He remembers the shape of the room, the disposal of its appointments, the little group of
    &quot;brethren&quot; surrounding him, and the surprise of finding himself, dressed in a
    long white garment, being suddenly dipped and lifted from the water. He has also a clear
    auditory remembrance of words spoken solemnly over him; though they meant nothing, he was
    impressed by the peculiar tone. It is not impossible that this gave him an all but
    unconquerable dislike for for the cold plunge, and at the same time a vivid passion for
    ceremonial speech. These two qualities have played highly important parts in his
    development.</p>
    <p>This baptism, by the way, though it never worried him, provided a peril to the soul of
    another. When his wife's conduct compelled him to insist upon her divorcing him --- a
    formality as meaningless as their marriage --- and she became insane shortly afterward, an
    eminent masochist named Colonel Gormley, R.A.M.C. (dead previously, then and since) lay in
    wait for her at the asylum gates to marry her. The trouble was that he included among his
    intellectual lacunae a devotion to the Romish superstition. He feared damnation</p>
    <p>{36}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: A lustre is a period of five years.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2">There is also a notable tuft of hair upon the forehead, similar to the
        mound of flesh there situated in the Buddhist legends. And numerous minor marks.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>if he married a divorceuse dipsomaniac with non-parva-partial dementia. The poor
    mollusc asked Crowley for details of his baptism. He wrote back that he had been baptised
    &quot;in the name of the Holy Trinity&quot;.</p>
    <p>It now appeared that, had these actual words been used, he was a pagan, his marriage
    void, Lola Zaza a bastard and his wife a light o'love!</p>
    <p>Crowley tried to help the wretched worm; but, alas, he remembered too well the formula:
    &quot;I baptise thee Edward Alexander in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy
    Ghost.&quot; So the gallant colonel had to fork out for a dispensation from Rome. Crowley
    himself squandered a lot of cash in one way or another. But he never fell so far as to
    waste a farthing on the three-card trick, or the three-God trick.</p>
    <p>He has also the clearest visualization of some of the people who surrounded him in the
    first six years of his life, which were spent in Leamington and the neighborhood, which he
    has never revisited. In particular, there was an orange-coloured old lady named Miss Carey
    who used to bring him oranges. His first memory of speech is his remark. &quot;Ca'ey,
    onange&quot;<strong>1</strong>; this, however, is remembered because he was told of it
    later. But he is in full conscious memory of the dining-room of the house, its furniture
    and pictures, with their arrangement. He also remembers various country walks, one
    especially through green fields, in which a perambulator figures. The main street of
    Leamington, and the Leam with its weir --- he has loved weirs ever since --- Guy's Cliffe
    at Warwick, and the Castle with its terrace and the white peacocks: all these are as clear
    as if he had seen them last week. He recalls no other room in the house except his own
    bedroom, and that only because he &quot;came to himself&quot; one night to find a fire
    lighted, a steam kettle going, a strange woman present, an atmosphere of anxiety and a
    feeling of fever; for he had an attack of bronchitis.</p>
    <p>He remembers his first governess, Miss Arkell, a grey-haired lady with traces of beard
    upon her large flat face and a black dress of what he calls bombasine, though to this hour
    he does not know what bombasine may be, and thinks that the dress was of alpaca or even,
    it may be of smooth hard silk.</p>
    <p>And he remembers the first indication that his mind was of a logical and scientific
    order.</p>
    <p>Ladies will now kindly skip a page, while I lay the facts before a select audience of
    lawyers, doctors and ministers of religion.</p>
    <p>The Misses Cowper consisted of Sister Susan and Sister Emma; the one large, rosy and
    dry, like an overgrown radish; the other small, pink and moist, rather like Tenniel's Mock
    Turtle. Both were Plymouth Sister old maids. They were very repulsive to the boy, who has
    never since liked calf's head, though partial to similar dishes, or been able to hear the
    names Susan or Emma without disgust.</p>
    <p>{37}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">He has never been able to pronounce &quot;R&quot; properly --- like a
        Chinese!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>One day he said something to his mother which elicited from her the curious anatomical
    assertion: &quot;Ladies have no legs.&quot; Shortly afterwards, when the Misses Cowper
    were at dinner with the family, he disappeared from his chair. There must have been some
    slight commotion on deck, leading to the question of his whereabouts. But at that moment a
    still small voice came from beneath the table: &quot;Mamma! Mamma! Sister Susan and Sister
    Emma are not ladies!&quot;</p>
    <p>This deduction was perfectly genuine: but in the following incident the cynical may
    perhaps trace the root of a certain sardonic humour. The child was wont to indicate his
    views, when silence seemed discretion, by facial gestures. Several people were rash enough
    to tell him not to make grimaces, as he &quot;might be struck like that&quot;. He would
    reply, with an air of enlightenment after long mediation: &quot;So that accounts for
    it.&quot;</p>
    <p>All children born into a family whose social and economic conditions are settled are
    bound to take them for granted as universal. It is only when they meet with incompatible
    facts that they begin to wonder whether they are suited to their original environment. In
    this particular case the most trifling incidents of life were necessarily interpreted as
    part of a prearranged plan, like the beginning of <em>Candide</em>.</p>
    <p>The underlying theory of life which was assumed in the household showed itself
    constantly in practice. It is strange that less than fifty years later, this theory should
    seem such fantastic folly as to require a detailed account.</p>
    <p>The universe was created by God 4004 B.C. The Bible, authorized version, was literally
    true, having been dictated by the Holy Ghost himself to scribes incapable of even clerical
    errors. King James' translators enjoyed an equal immunity. It was considered unusual ---
    and therefore in doubtful taste --- to appeal to the original texts. All other versions
    were regarded as inferior; the Revised Version in particular savoured of heresy. John
    Nelson Darby, the founder of the Plymouth Brethren, being a very famous biblical scholar,
    had been invited to sit on the committee and had refused on the ground that some of the
    other scholars were atheists.</p>
    <p>The second coming of the Lord Jesus was confidently expected to occur at any moment<strong>1</strong>.
    So imminent was it that preparations for a distant future --- such as signing a lease or
    insuring one's life --- might he held to imply lack of confidence of the promise,
    &quot;Behold I come quickly.&quot;</p>
    <p>A pathetically tragic incident --- some years later --- illustrates the reality of this
    absurdity. To modern educated people it must seem unthinkable that</p>
    <p>{38}<ol>
      <li>Much was made of the two appearances of &quot;Jesus&quot; after the Ascension. In the
        first, to Stephen, he was standing, in the second, to Paul, seated, at the right hand of
        god. Ergo, on the first occasion he was still ready to return at once; on the second, he
        had made up his mind to let things take their course to the bitter end, as per the
        Apocalypse. No one saw anything funny, or blasphemous, or even futile, in this doctrine!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>so fantastic a superstition could be such a hellish obsession in such recent times and
    such familiar places.</p>
    <p>One fine summer morning, at Redhill, the boy --- now eight or nine --- got tired of
    playing by himself in the garden. He came back to the house. It was strangely still and he
    got frightened. By some odd chance everybody was either out or upstairs. But he jumped to
    the conclusion that &quot;the Lord had come&quot;, and that he had been left behind&quot;.
    It was an understood thing that there was no hope for people in this position. Apart from
    the Second Advent, it was always possible to be saved up the very moment of death; but
    once the saints had been called up, the day of grace was finally over. Various alarums and
    excursions would take place as per the Apocalypse, and then would come the millennium,
    when Satan would be chained for a thousand years and Christ reign for that period over the
    Jews regathered in Jerusalem. The position of these Jews is not quite clear. They were not
    saved in the same sense as Christians had been, yet they were not damned. The millennium
    seems to have been thought of as a fulfilment of god's promise to Abraham; but apparently
    it had nothing to do with &quot;eternal life&quot;. However, even this modified beatitude
    as not open to Gentiles who had rejected Christ.</p>
    <p>The child was consequently very much relieved by the reappearance of some of the
    inmates of the house whom he could not imagine as having been lost eternally.</p>
    <p>The lot of the saved, even on earth, was painted in the brightest colours. It was held
    that &quot;all things work together for good to them that love God and are called
    according to His purpose&quot;. Earthly life was regarded as an ordeal; this was a wicked
    world and the best thing that could happen to anyone was &quot;to go to be with Christ,
    which is far better&quot;. On the other hand, the unsaved went to the lake of fire and
    brimstone which burneth for ever and ever. Edward Crowley used to give away tracts to
    strangers, besides distributing them by thousands through the post; he was also constantly
    preaching to vast crowds, all over the country. It was, indeed, the only logical
    occupation for a humane man who believed that even the noblest and best of mankind were
    doomed to eternal punishment. One card --- a great favourite, as being peculiarly deadly
    --- was headed &quot;Poor Anne's Last Words&quot;; the gist of her remarks appears to have
    been &quot;Lost, lost, lost!&quot; She had been a servant in the house of Edward Crowley
    the elder, and her dying delirium had made a deep impression upon the son of the house.</p>
    <p>By the way, Edward Crowley possessed the power, as per Higgins, the professor in
    Bernard Shaw's <em>Pygmalion</em>, of telling instantly from a man's speech what part of
    the country he lived in. It was his hobby to make walking tours through every part of
    England, evangelizing in every town and village as he passed. He would engage likely
    strangers in conversation, diagnose and prescribe for their spiritual diseases, inscribe
    them in his</p>
    <p>{39}</p>
    <p>Address books, and correspond and send religious literature for years. At that time
    religion was the popular fad in England and few resented his ministrations. His widow
    continued the sending of tracts, etc. For years after his death.</p>
    <p>As a preacher Edward Crowley was magnificently eloquent, speaking as he did from the
    heart. But, being a gentleman, he could not be a real revivalist, which means manipulating
    the hysteria of mob psychology.</p>
