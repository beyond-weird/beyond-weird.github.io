    <p>I think it proper to devote an entire chapter to the subject of my relations with
    freemasonry. I have mentioned that I had obtained the 33° in Mexico City. It did not add
    much of importance to my knowledge of the mysteries; but I had heard that freemasonry was
    a universal brotherhood and epected to be welcomed all over the world by all brethren.</p>
    <p>I was brought up with a considerable shock within the next few months, when, chancing
    to discuss the subject with some broken-down gambler or sporting-house tout --- I forget
    exactly --- I found that he would not &quot;recognize&quot; me! There was some trivial
    difference in one of the grips or some other totally meaningless formality. A measureless
    contempt for the whole mummery curled my lip. I squared the matter (as already related) by
    having myself initiated in Lodge Number 343 &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; in Paris. What that
    led to I have recounted elsewhere and now quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I happened to know that the chaplain of the British Embassy in Z--- was Past Grand
      Organist of a certain English province. He proposed me, found a seconder, and I was duly
      initiated, passed and raised. I was warmly welcomed by numerous English and American
      visitors to our Lodge; for Z--- is a very great city.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I returned to England sometime later, after &quot;passing the chair&quot; in my Lodge,
      and wishing to join the Royal Arch, called on its venerable Secretary.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I presented my credentials. &quot;O Thou Great Architect of the Universe,&quot; the old
      man sobbed out in rage, &quot;why dost Thou not wither this impudent impostor with Thy
      fire from heaven? Sir, begone! You are not a Mason at all! As all the world knows, the
      people in Z--- are atheists and live with other men's wives.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I thought this a little hard on my Reverend Father in God, my proposer; and I noted
    that, of course, every single English or American visitor to our Lodge in Z--- stood in
    peril of instant and irrevocable expulsion on detection. So I said nothing, but walked to
    another room in Freemasons' Hall over his head, and took my seat as a Past Master in one
    of the oldest and most eminent Lodges in London!</p>
    <p>Kindly note, furthermore, that when each of those wicked visitors returned to their
    Lodges after their crime, they automatically excommunicated the</p>
    <p>{695}</p>
    <p>whole thereof; and as visiting is very common, it may well be doubted whether, on their
    own showing, there is a single &quot;just, lawful and regular mason&quot; left on the
    earth!</p>
    <p>By the end of 1910, thanks to my relations with the Grand Hierophant 97° of the Rite
    of Memphis (a post held after his death by Dr. Gerard Encausee, Theodor Reuss, and
    myself), I was now a sort of universal inspector-general of the various rites, charged
    with the secret mission of reporting on the possibility of reconstructing the entire
    edifice, which was universally recognized by all its more intelligent members as being
    threatened with the gravest danger.</p>
    <p>I must briefly explain the circumstances.</p>
    <p>(a) There is a great multiplicity of rites.</p>
    <p>(b) There is a great multiplicity of jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>(c) Even where rite and jurisdiction are identical, there are certain national
    jealousies and other causes of divergence.</p>
    <p>(d) The Progress of feminism has threatened the Craft. (The meaning of the 3° having
    been totally lost, orthodox freemasons are unable to explain why women cannot become
    Master Masons. They cannot. I, the fiercest of feminists, say so.) Co-Masonry, under Mrs
    Besant, whose hysterical vanity compels her to claim any high-sounding title that she
    happens to hear, <em>Le Droit Humain</em> in France, and similar movements almost
    everywhere, were bringing masonry into contempt by their sheer silliness. They were so
    obviously exactly as good as real freemasons.</p>
    <p>(e) The history of freemasonry has become more obscure as the light of research has
    fallen on the subject. The meaning of masonry has either been completely forgotten or has
    never existed at all, except insofar as any particular rite might be a cloak for political
    or even worse intrigue.</p>
    <p>(f) It has become impossible for people living in modern conditions to devote adequate
    time even to learning the merest formalities.</p>
    <p>(g) The complete lack of understanding which is now practically universal has made men
    inquire why in God's name they should cherish such pretentious pedantries?</p>
    <p>A few anecdotes will illustrate the situation for the average non- mason.</p>
    <p>1. A certain rite in England derives its authority from a document which is as
    notoriously a forgery as Pigott ever penned. The heads of this gang wished to break, in
    the most shameless and rascally manner, an agreement made some years previously with John
    Yarker. Yarker pointed out that their only real authority was derived from their agreement
    with him, since he, working under a genuine charter, had &quot;heled&quot; their breach
    with antiquity by recognizing them. They replied that they relied on the forged document.
    He said that he would cut away the ground from under their feet by publishing the proofs
    that their charter was worthless. Then they said that they</p>
    <p>{696}</p>
    <p>knew as well as he did that the document was forged; but they didn't care, because they
    had induced the Prince of Wales to join them!</p>
    <p>2. Several of the main rites of English masonry are not recognized by each other, and
    some of these are not even tolerated (that is, if a member of A joins B, or even discusses
    freemasonry with a member of B, he becomes liable to immediate expulsion); yet a certain
    royal duke was actually the head of two incompatible rites.</p>
    <p>3. There is no uniformity with regard to toleration. Thus A and B sometimes recognize
    each other, but, while A recognizes C, B does not, so that a member of B and a member of C
    might find themselves meeting in a Lodge of A, and thereby automatically excommunicate
    each other.</p>
    <p>4. English Craft masons do not permit religious political or commercial motives to
    enter into freemasonry, yet they are in official relationship with certain masonic bodies
    whose sole <em>raison d'être</em> is anti- clericalism, political intrigue or mutual
    trade benefit.</p>
    <p>5. The Scottish Rite, the degrees of Knight Templar, Knight of Malta and others in
    England are definitely Christian, e.g. the point of one degree is the identification of
    prophet, priest and king, three in one, the Trinity of the Royal Arch, with Christ; and in
    the Rose Croix degree, Christ is recognized as the &quot;corner stone&quot; of earlier
    symbolism. But in America, the Christian elements have been removed so that wealthy Jews
    may reach the summit of masonry.</p>
    <p>6. I once attended a Lodge whose Master was one of the two local bankers. He used his
    influence to get business for his bank. The other banker promptly obtained a charter from
    some &quot;clandestine&quot; body and started an opposition. In this district, the
    clandestine Lodges greatly outnumbered the orthodox.</p>
    <p>7. I have visited Craft Lodges and Royal Arch Chapters in Fraternal Accord in England,
    where the &quot;raising&quot; and &quot;exaltation&quot; were carried out in shirt
    sleeves, while cigars were smoked and the legs conveniently disposed on other chairs, and
    only employed to kick the candidate as he went round.</p>
    <p>8. At one ceremony in America, the officers being 33° masons, recognized by the
    orthodox Scottish Rite in England, there were two candidates, both Jews. They were
    hoodwinked and introduced into opposite ends of a tube through which they were instructed
    to make their way. In the middle of the tube was a live sow.</p>
    <p>9. In Detroit, a member of the 32° was threatened by certain 33°s with expulsion
    unless he complied with their views as to his domestic life. The matter was one with which
    they had no right to meddle on any conceivable theory of human relations.</p>
    <p>10. In some parts of America, financial and social pressure is put upon</p>
    <p>{697}</p>
    <p>people to <em>compel</em> them to take the 32°! It is common to boycott men in trade
    or business for refusing to give unfair advantages to their fellow masons.</p>
    <p>11. A 33° mason, of many years' standing, holding high office in the Supreme Grand
    Council, who had joined in order to obtain the traditional secret knowledge, told me that
    he had never learnt anything from any of the degrees. The only peculiarity in this case is
    that he should have expected anything of the sort --- or wanted it!</p>
    <p>12. With hardly an exception, the &quot;secrets&quot; of freemasonry are strictly
    arbitrary. Let me explain what I mean. If I am given the combination of a safe, I expect
    to be able to open it by the use of the word. If I can do so, it proves that that is the
    correct word. The secrets of freemasonry disclose no mysteries; they do not do what they
    profess to do; they are meaningless conventions.</p>
    <p>13. With the rarest exceptions, freemasons make no attempt to keep their obligations so
    far as the moral principles inculcated are concerned. For instance, the Master Mason is
    sworn to respect the chastity of the wife, sister and daughter of his Brother. Those who
    do so probably respect the chastity of any woman irrespective of her male connections.</p>
    <p>14. Freemasons, generally, but especially in England and America, resent any attempt to
    take masonry seriously. I may quote an essay by a Past Grand Master. It appeared in the <em>English
    Review</em> for August 1922. It sets forth the initiated view. The question is: Why does a
    man become a mason?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We ought to cross off the pettier human motives first, love of vanity, of mystery, of
      display, of make-believe; but the average man in England becomes a mason for as serious a
      reason as he become a Church member or a theosophist; and the average man is usually most
      abominably disillusioned.</p>
      <p>He may join the Craft with some idea of fellowship, because it is a tradition in his
      family to do so, or because he hopes to find in the Secret of the Mysteries something
      which he does not find in any of the exoteric forms of religion.</p>
      <p>How is it that the same Order satisfies --- more or less --- aspirations so diverse?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We are brought at last face to face with the fundamental problem of the masonic
      historian --- the origin of the whole business.</p>
      <p>Without any hesitation at all, one may confess that on this critical question nothing
      is certainly known. It is true, indeed, that the Craft Lodges in England were originally
      Hanoverian clubs, as the Scottish Lodges were Jacobite clubs, and the Egyptian Lodges of
      Cagliostro revolutionary clubs.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{698}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But that no more explains the origin of freemasonry than the fact &quot;many Spaniards
      are Roman Catholics&quot; explains why the priest says and does certain things rather than
      others in the Mass.</p>
      <p>Now here is the tremendous question: we can admit all Mr Yarker's contentions, and
      more, as to the connection of masonic and quasimasonic rites with the old customs of
      initiating people into the trade guilds; but why should such a matter be hedged about with
      so severe a wardenship, and why should the Central Sacrament partake of so awful and so
      unearthly a character?</p>
      <p>As freemasonry has been &quot;exposed&quot; every few minutes for the last century or
      so, and as any layman can walk into a masonic shop and buy the complete Rituals for a few
      pence, the only omissions being of no importance to our present point, it would be
      imbecile to pretend that the nature of the ceremonies of Craft masonry is an any sense a
      &quot;mystery&quot;.</p>
      <p>There is, therefore, no reason for refraining from the plain statement that, to anyone
      who understands the rudiments of symbolism, the Master's degree is identical with the
      Mass. This is in fact the real reason for papal anathema; for freemasonry asserts that
      every man is himself the living, slain and re-arisen Christ in his own person.</p>
      <p>It is true that not one mason in ten thousand in England is aware of this fact; but he
      has only to remember his &quot;raising&quot; to realize the fundamental truth of the
      statement.</p>
      <p>Well may Catholic and freemason alike stand appalled at the stupendous blasphemy which
      is implied, as they ignorantly think, not knowing themselves of the stuff and substance of
      the Supreme Self, each for himself alike no less than Very God of Very God!</p>
      <p>But suppose that the sublimity of this conception is accepted, the identity admitted;
      what sudden overwhelming billow from the past blasts their beatitude? What but the words
      with which Freud concludes <em>Totem and Tabo</em>o: In the beginning was the deed!</p>
      <p>For the &quot;sacrifice of the Innocent&quot; celebrated alike in the Lode and in
      cathedral is this identical murder of the Master of the Fellow- Craftsmen, that is of the
      Father by his sons, when the ape system of the &quot;Fatherhorde&quot; was replaced by the
      tribal system which developed into the &quot;military clan&quot;!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These statements are undeniable, yet it may be doubted whether there are five hundred
    freemasons of all the rites put together who would assent to them, or even refrain from
    objecting to them as bitterly as the average man in Victorian times disliked being told of
    his kinship with the other primates, and as his children and grandchildren are annoyed
    when science demonstrates</p>
    <p>{699}</p>
    <p>that their religions are survivals of savage superstitions and their dreams determined
    by bestial instincts.</p>
    <p>15. The W.M. of an exclusive English Lodge told me that he had learnt his part by
    saying it over to his wife in bed, justifying himself for this apparent breach of his
    obligation by remarking, with a laugh, that the secrets were lost and that therefore he
    could not betray them however much he wanted to.</p>
    <p>Faced with these, and similar difficulties, I gladly accepted the task laid upon me by
    the most intelligent freemasons of the world, united as they were by their sincerity,
    understanding and good will, though divided by sectarian squabbles about jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>My first object was to answer the question, &quot;What is freemasonry?&quot; I collated
    the rituals and their secrets, much as I had done the religions of the world, with their
    magical and mystical bases. As in that case, I decided to neglect what it too often
    actually was. It would be absurd to judge Protestantism by the political acts of Henry
    VIII. In the same way, I could not judge masonry by the fact that it had denounced the
    Concordat. I proposed to define freemasonry as a system of communicating truth ---
    religious, philosophical, magical and mystical; and indicating the proper means of
    developing human faculty by means of a peculiar language whose alphabet is the symbolism
    of ritual. Universal brotherhood and the greater moral principles, independent of
    personal, racial, climatic and other prejudices, naturally formed a background which would
    assure individual security and social stability for each and all.</p>
    <p>The question then arose, &quot;What truths should be communicated and by what means
    promulgated? My first object was to eliminate from the hundreds of rituals at my disposal
    all exoteric elements. Many degrees contain statements (usually inaccurate) of matters
    well known to modern schoolboys, through they may have been important when the rituals
    were written. I may mention one degree in which the candidate is portentiously informed
    that there are other religions in the world besides Christianity and that there is some
    truth in all of them. Their tenets are explained in many cases with egregious error. The
    description of Buddha as a god is typical. I saw no point in overloading the system with
    superfluous information.</p>
    <p>Another essential point was to reduce the unwieldly mass of material to a compact and
    coherent system. I thought that everything worth preserving could and should be presented
    in not more than a dozen ceremonies, and that it should be brought well within the
    capacity of any officer to learn by heart his part during the leisure time at his
    disposal, in a month at most.</p>
    <p>The eighteenth-century Rosicrucians, so-called in Austria, had already endeavoured to
    unite various branches of Continental freemasonry and its superstructures; in the
    nineteenth century, principally owing to the energy</p>
    <p>{700}</p>
    <p>and ability of a wealthy iron master named Karl Kellner, a reconstruction and
    consolidation of traditional truth had been attempted. A body was formed under the name
    O.T.O. (Ordo Templi Orientis) which purported to achieve this result. It purported to
    communicate the secrets, not only of freemasonry (with the Rites of 3°, 7°, 33°, 90°,
    97°, etc.,) but of the Gnostic Catholic Church, the Martinists, the Sat Bhai, the
    Rosicrucians, the Knights of the Holy Ghost and so on, in nine degrees, with a tenth of an
    honorary character to distinguish the &quot;Supreme and Holy King&quot; of the Order in
    each country where it was established. Chief of these kings is the O.H.O. (Outer Head of
    the Order, or Frater Superior), who is an absolute autocrat. This position was at this
    time occupied by Theodor Reuss, the Supreme and Holy King of Germany, who resigned the
    office in 1922 in my favour.</p>
    <p>The O.H.O. put the rituals of this Order at my disposal. I found them of the utmost
    value as to the central secret, but otherwise very inferior. They were dramatically
    worthless, but the prose was unequal, they lacked philosophical unity, their information
    was incomplete and unsystematic. Their general idea was, however, of the right kind; and I
    was able to take them as a model.</p>
    <p>The main objects of the instruction were two. It was firstly necessary to explain the
    universe and the relations of human life therewith. Secondly, to instruct every man how
    best to adapt his life to the cosmos and to develop his faculties to the utmost advantage.
    I accordingly constructed a series or rituals, Minerval, Man, Magician, Master-Magician,
    Perfect Magician and Perfect Initiate, which should illustrate the course of human life in
    its largest philosophical aspect. I begin by showing the object of the pure soul,
    &quot;One, individual and eternal&quot;, in determining to formulate itself consciously,
    or, as I may say, to understand itself.</p>
    <p>It chooses to enter into relations with the solar system. It incarnates. I explain the
    significance of birth and the conditions established by the process. I next show how it
    may best carry out its object in the eucharist of life. It partakes, so to speak, of its
    own godhead in every action, but especially through the typical sacrament of marriage,
    understood as the voluntary union of itself with each element of its environment. I then
    proceed to the climax of its career in death and show how this sacrament both consecrates
    (or, rather, sets its seal upon) the previous procedure and gives a meaning thereto, just
    as the auditing of the account enables the merchant to see his year's transactions in
    perspective.</p>
    <p>In the next ceremony I show how the individual, released by death from the obsession of
    personality, resumes relations with the truth of the universe. Reality bursts upon him in
    a blaze of adorable light; he is able to appreciate its splendour as he could not
    previously do, since his incarnation has enabled him to establish particular relations
    between the elements of eternity.</p>
    <p>{701}</p>
    <p>Finally, the cycle is closed by the reabsorption of all individuality into infinity. It
    ends in absolute annihilation which, as has been shown elsewhere in this book, may in
    reality be regarded either as an exact equivalent for all other terms soever, or (by
    postulating the category of time) as forming the starting point for new adventure of the
    same kind.</p>
    <p>It will be clear from the above that the philosophical perfection of this system of
    initiation leaves nothing to be desired. We may write Q.E.D. The practical problem
    remains. We have already decided to incarnate, and our birth certificates are with our
    bankers. We do not have to worry about these matters, and we cannot alter them if we
    would; death, and what follows death, are equally certain, and equally able to take care
    of themselves. Our sole preoccupation is how best to make use of our lives.</p>
    <p>Now the O.T.O. is in possession of one supreme secret. The whole of its system at the
    time when I became an initiate of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis (IX°) was directed towards
    communicating to its members, by progressively plain hints, this all-important
    instruction. I personally believe that if this secret, which is a scientific secret, were
    perfectly understood, as it is not even my me after more than twelve years' almost
    constant study and experiment, there would be nothing which the human imagination can
    conceive that could not be realized in practice.</p>
    <p>By this I mean such things as this: that if it were desired to have an element of
    atomic weight six times that of uranium that element could be produced. If it were desired
    to devise an instrument by which the furthest stars or the electrons could be brought
    within the range of every one of our senses, that instrument could be invented. Or that,
    if we wished to develop senses through which we could appreciate all those qualities of
    matter which at present we observe indirectly by means of apparatus, the necessary nervous
    structure would appear. It make these remarks with absolute confidence, for even the
    insignificant approaches that I have been able to make towards the sanctuaries of this
    secret have shown me that the relations between phenomena are infinitely more complex than
    the wildest philosophers have ever imagined, and that the old proverb &quot;Where there's
    a will there's a way&quot; needs no caveat.</p>
    <p>I cannot forebear to quote from Professor A. S. Eddington, Plumian Professor of
    Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy at Cambridge:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Here is a paradox beyond even the imagination of Dean Swift. Gulliver regarded the
      Lilliputians as a race of dwarfs; and the Lilliputians regarded Gulliver as a giant. That
      is natural. If the Lilliputians had appeared dwarfs to Gulliver, and Gulliver had appeared
      a dwarf to the Lilliputians --- but no! that is too absurd for fiction, and is an idea
      only to be found in the sober pages of science.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{702}</p>
    <p>The injunctions of the sages, from Pythagoras, Zoroaster and Lao Tzu, to the
    Cabbalistic Jew who wrote the Ritual of the Royal Arch, and the sentimental snob who
    composed those of the Craft degrees, are either directed to indicating the best conditions
    for applying this secret, or are mere waste of words. Realizing this, it was comparatively
    simple for me to edit masonic ethics and esotericism. I had simply to refer everything to
    this single sublime standard. I therefore answered the question &quot;How should a young
    man mend his way?&quot; in a series of rituals in which the candidate is instructed in the
    value of discretion, loyalty, independence, truthfulness, courage, self-control,
    indifference to circumstance, impartiality, scepticism, and other virtues, and at the same
    time assisted him to discover for himself the nature of this secret, the proper object of
    its employment and the best means for insuring success in its use. The first of these
    degrees is the V°, in which the secret is presented in a pageant; while he is also
    instructed in the essential elements of the history of the world, considered from the
    standpoint of his present state of evolution and in his proper relation to society in
    general with reference to the same.</p>
    <p>The degree of Knight Hermetic Philosopher follows, in which his intellectual and moral
    attitude is further defined. In the VI°, his position having been thus made precise, he
    is shown how to consecrate himself to the particular Great Work which he came to earth in
    order to perform. In the VII°, which is tripartite, he is first taught the principle of
    equilibrium as extended to all possible moral ideas; secondly, to all possible
    intellectual ideas; and lastly, he is shown how, basing all his actions on this
    impregnable rock of justice, he may so direct his life as to undertake his Great Work with
    the fullest responsibility and in absolute freedom from all possibility of interferences.</p>
    <p>In the VIII°, the secret is once more manifested to him, more clearly than before; and
    he is instructed in how to train himself to use it by certain preliminary practices
    involving acquaintance with some of those subtler energies which have hitherto, for the
    most part, eluded the observation and control of profane science.</p>
    <p>In the IX°, which is never conferred upon anyone who has not already divined from
    previous indications the nature of the secret, it is explained to him fully. The
    conclusions of previous experiments are placed at his service. The idea is that each new
    initiate should continue the work of his predecessor, so that eventually the inexhaustible
    resources of the secret may be within the reach of the youngest initiate; for at present,
    we are compelled to admit that the superstitious reverence which has encompassed it in
    past ages, and the complexity of the conditions which modify its use, place us in much the
    same position as the electricians of a generation ago in respect of their science. We are
    assured of the immensity of the force at our disposal;</p>
    <p>{703}</p>
    <p>we perceive the extent of the empire which it offers us, but we do not thoroughly
    understand even our successes and are uncertain how to proceed in order to generate the
    energy most efficiently or to apply it most accurately to our purposes.</p>
    <p>The X°, as in the old system, is merely honorary, but recent researches into the
    mysteries of the IX° have compelled me to add an XI°, to illustrate a scientific idea
    which has been evolved by the results of recent experiments.</p>
    <p>In the reconstituted O.T.O. there are therefore six degrees in which is conveyed a
    comprehensive conception of the cosmos and our relation therewith, and a similar number to
    deal with our duty to ourselves and our fellows, the development of our own faculties of
    every order, and the general advancement and advantage of mankind.</p>
    <p>Wherever freemasonry and allied systems contribute to these themes, their information
    has been incorporated in such a way as not to infringe the privileges, puerile as they
    often seem, which have been associated hitherto with initiation. Where they merely
    perpetuate trivialities, superstitions and prejudices, they have been neglected.</p>
    <p>I claim for my system that it satisfies all possible requirements of true freemasonry.
    It offers a rational basis for universal brotherhood and for universal religion. It puts
    forward a scientific statement which is a summary of all that is at present known about
    the universe by means of a simple, yet sublime symbolism, artistically arranged. It also
    enables each man to discover for himself his personal destiny, indicates the moral and
    intellectual qualities which he requires in order to fulfil it freely, and finally puts in
    his hands an unimaginably powerful weapon which he may use to develop in himself every
    faculty which he may need in his work.</p>
    <p>My original draft of these rituals has required modification in numerous details as
    research made clearer, deeper and wider the truth which they comprehended; and also, as
    experience showed, the possibilities of misunderstanding on the one hand, and of improved
    presentation on the other. Great practical progress was made until the work was suspended
    by the outbreak of the war in 1914.</p>
    <p>One of my original difficulties was to restore the existing rituals to their
    perfection. There were innumerable corruptions due to ignorance of Hebrew and the like on
    the part of the unworthy successors of the founders. To take a gross example.</p>
    <p>The word <em>Jeheshua</em>, spelt in Hebrew in the 18° of the Scottish Rite, was
    habitually spelt with a Resh instead of a Vau. So brutal a blunder is conclusive proof
    that the modern Sovereign Princes of Rose Croix attach no meaning whatever to the name of
    Jesus --- which they profess to adore more intelligently than the mob because it
    represents the descent of the Holy Spirit into the midst of that tremendous name of God
    which only occurs in</p>
    <p>{704}</p>
    <p>their ritual because of its power to annihilate the universe if pronounced correctly<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>The intelligence of the average mason may be gauged by the following quotation from the
    R.A.M. degree. The twentieth century! --- and such stuff is solemnly offered as
    instruction to grown men!</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Some have doubted whether the Ark was capable of containing two of every sort of
      creature, with provisions necessary for their support for a whole year; for so long and
      more did Noah stop in that Ark. But on a careful inquiry it has been found that only about
      one hundred different sorts of beasts, and not two hundred birds, are known, the greater
      part of them are of no bulk, and many exceedingly small, and it has been said all the
      creatures in the Ark would not take up the room of five hundred horses. After four
      thousand years human ingenuity cannot now contrive any proportions better adapted than
      that of the Ark for the purpose it was intended for. A Dutch merchant, two hundred years
      ago, built a ship answering in its respective dimensions to those of the Ark; its length
      being one hundred and twenty feet, breadth twenty feet, depth twelve feet; while building,
      this vessel was laughed at, but afterwards it was found that it held one third more and
      sailed better than any other merchant vessel of the time.</p>
      <p>Thus we have a collateral proof no way inconsiderable that the Spirit of God, from whom
      commeth all understanding, directed Noah in that manner.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Again, the central secret of a Master Mason is in a Word which is lost. This fact has
    induced various and ingenious persons to invent ceremonies in which it is found (in some
    more or less remarkable manner) amid the acclamations of the assembled populace, and
    proclaimed in pomp to the admiring multitude. The only drawback is that these Words do not
    work. It apparently never occurred to these ingenuous artisans to test it. It is useless
    to label a brick &quot;This is the keystone of the Royal Arch&quot;, unless the arch
    stands when it is put in place.</p>
    <p>Much of freemasonry is connected with the Hebrew Cabbala. My knowledge of this science
    enabled me to analyse the Secret Words of the various degrees. I soon found myself able to
    correct many of the corruptions which had crept in, and there was no doubt that my
    conclusions were not mere conjectures, since they made coherent good sense out of
    disconnected nonsense. (I am naturally unable to publish any of these discoveries; but</p>
    <p>{705}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">The ignorance of masons is quite boundless. In the Red Cross of Rome and
        Constantine Degree, for example, we read, &quot;Lord God of Sabbath&quot;. No one knows
        the difference between HB:Taw HB:Bet HB:Shin and HB:Taw HB:Aleph HB:Bet HB:Tzaddi !</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am always ready to communicate them to inquiring Brothers. When I have done so, my
    arguments have been found cogent and convincing.)</p>
    <p>I supposed myself to have reached the summit of success when I restored the Secret Word
    of the Royal Arch. In this case, tradition had preserved the Word almost intact. It
    required only a trifling change to reveal it in all its radiant royalty. And yet my
    success only left me with a sense of deeper annoyance at my complete failure to deal with
    the abject anti-climax of the III° with its lamentable excuses for having made a fool of
    the candidate, its pretentious promises and its pitiful performance.</p>
    <p>As I lay one night sleepless, in meditation, bitter and eager, upon this mystery I was
    suddenly stabbed to the soul by a suggestion so simple, yet so stupendous, that I was
    struck into shuddering silence for I know not how long before I could bring myself to
    switch on the electric light and snatch my notebook. At the first trial the solution
    sprang like sunlight in my spirit. I remained all that night in an ecstasy of awe and
    adoration. I had discovered the lost Word!</p>
    <p>The obvious line of criticism is this: How can you be sure that the Word which you have
    discovered is really the lost Word after all?</p>
    <p>This may be made clear by an illustration. On the apron of the 18° I find HB:Heh
    HB:Resh HB:Shin HB:Heh HB:Yod in Hebrew characters. I find that this word<br>
    means nothing; the context suggests that it may be an error for HB:Heh HB:Vau HB:Shin
    HB:Heh HB:Yod , Yeheshuah or Jesus; but how do I know that this word and not another has
    power to make man triumphant over matter, to harmonize and sanctify the blind forces of
    the universe? Thus: I know that HB:Heh HB:Vau HB:Heh HB:Yod represents the four elements;
    that 4 is a number symbolizing limitation. It is the square of 2, the only number which
    cannot be formed harmoniously into a &quot;Magic Square&quot;. (Two represents the Dyad,
    the original Error.) I know also that the letter Shin represents a triune essence, the
    fire of the Spirit, and in particular Ruach Elohim, the Spirit of the Gods, because these
    two words have the numerical value of 300, which is also that of Shin itself.</p>
    <p>I thus interpret the word Yeheshuah as the descent of the Holy Spirit into the balanced
    forces of matter, and the name Yeheshuah is therefore that of a man made divine by the
    descent of the Holy Spirit into his heart, exactly as the name George means a farmer. This
    exegetical method is not a modern invention. When Jehovah selected a family to be the
    father of Israel, he changed the name HB:Mem-final HB:Resh HB:Bet HB:Aleph (243 = Abram)
    Father of Elevation into HB:Mem-final HB:Heh HB:Resh HB:Bet HB:Aleph (248 = Abraham)
    Father of a multitude; and by way of compensation changed HB:Yod HB:Resh HB:Shin
    (510=Sari) Nobility to HB:Heh HB:Resh HB:Shin (505=Sarah), Princess. There are several
    other similar stories in the Bible. A change of name is considered to indicate a change of
    nature. Further, each name is not arbitrary; it is a definite description of the nature of
    the object to which it is attached. By a similar process, I am certain of my results in
    the matter of the Lost Word, for the Found Word</p>
    <p>{706}</p>
    <p>fulfils the conditions of the situation; and furthermore, throws light on the obscure
    symbolism of the entire ritual.</p>
    <p>I am thus in a position to do for the contending sects of freemasonry what the
    Alexandrians did for those of paganism. Unfortunately, the men who asked me to undertake
    this task are either dead or too old to take active measures and so far there is no one to
    replace them. Worse, the general coarsening of manners which always follows a great war
    has embittered the rival jurisdictions and deprived freemasonry altogether of those
    elements of high-minded enthusiasms with regard to the great problems of society which
    still stirred even its most degenerate sections half a century ago, when Hargrave
    Jennings, Godfrey Higgins, Gerald Massey, Kenneth MacKenzie, John Yarker, Theodor Reuss,
    Wynn Westcott and others were still seeking truth in its traditions and endeavouring to
    erect a temple of Concord in which men of all creeds and races might worship in amity.</p>
    <p>I attempted to make the appeal of the new system universal by combining it with a
    practical system of fraternal intercourse and mutual benefit. I formulated a scheme of
    insurance against all the accidents of life; the details are given in the Official
    Instructions and Essays published in <em>The
    Equinox</em>, vol. III, no. I</a>; and to set the example I transferred the whole of my
    property to trustees for the Order. The general idea is this; that every man should enjoy
    his possessions and the full fruits of his labours exactly as he does under his original
    individualistic system, but the pooling of such possessions by economy of administration,
    etc., leaves a surplus which can be used for the general purposes of the Order. I wished
    to introduce the benefits of co-operation without interfering with the individual
    absoluteness of the elements of the combination.</p>
    <p>The plan promised excellently. The working expenses of the Order were almost negligibly
    small. We were therefore able to allow members to borrow in case of necessity up to the
    total amount of their fees and subscriptions; to give them a month's holiday for less than
    a week would have cost an outsider; to save them all medical, legal and similar expenses;
    to solve the problem of rent, and so on. We offered all the fabled advantages of socialism
    without in any way interfering with individual dignity and independence.</p>
    <p>I can hardly be blamed for the catastrophe which has temporarily suspended the work.
    During the war the Grand Treasurer became insane. His character changed completely. He
    developed a form of persecution mania, in which his oldest and best friends seemed to him
    to be conspiring against him. Abetted by a dishonest solicitor, he alienated the whole of
    the property of the Order with extraordinary thoroughness. He actually destroyed a great
    part of the library; he falsified the figures; and after opposing all sorts of delays to
    the demand for his account, he actually made away with my</p>
    <p>{707}</p>
    <p>very underclothing. My only remaining resources were some twenty thousand pounds' worth
    of books which he could not touch without paying the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds
    or so, which was due to the people with whom they were stored. I paid this amount in 1921
    and the warehousemen then refused to hand over the books or to pay me the balance owing to
    me on their own statement. They trusted to be able to steal them, having heard that I was
    unable to find the money necessary to sue them.</p>
    <p>I thus found myself after the war entirely penniless and without clothes, except for
    some of my Highland costumes which had been sent for repair to a tailor just before the
    outbreak of hostilities and had remained safely in storage. I do not regret these events,
    except that I grieve over the calamity to my brother. I believe it to have been part of
    the plan of the gods that I should be compelled to face the world entirely without other
    than moral resources. Such is certainly a supreme test of the essential strength of any
    economic proposal.</p>
    <p>The system has justified itself astonishingly even in these unheard-of difficulties; I
    have been able to establish a branch of the Order with entire leisure to work at high
    pressure at its own objects, without internal friction or economic collapse, although the
    income is derived exclusively from casual windfalls. If we were able to carry out the full
    principles of the system, we should already be so prosperous as to be able to devote
    ourselves exclusively to extending the advantages of the scheme to the world at large.</p>
    <p>With regard to the original purposes of the Order, there can be no doubt that the
    reduction of the cumbersome mass of masonic and similar matters to a simple intelligible
    and workable system enables people to enjoy the full advantages of initiations which, in
    the old days, were too multiple to be conferred even on those who devoted a
    disproportionate amount of their lives to the subject. The central secret of freemasonry
    which was lost, and is found, is in daily use by initiates of our Order. Scientific facts
    are accumulating rapidly; and it is certain that within a short time we shall be able to
    dispose of a force more powerful than electricity and capable of more extended
    application, with the same certainly. Our qualitative results are unquestionable. The lack
    of quantitative methods, which has for so many centuries prevented the systematic
    application of our knowledge, will soon be supplied.</p>
    <p>I may say that the secret of the O.T.O., besides what has been mentioned above, has
    proved to all intents and purposes the simplification and concentration of the whole of my
    magical knowledge. All my old methods have been unified in this new method. It does not
    exactly replace them, but it interprets them. It has also enabled me to construct a
    uniform type of engine for accomplishing anything that I will.</p>
    <p>My association with freemasonry was therefore destined to be more</p>
    <p>{708}</p>
    <p>fertile than almost any other study, and that in a way despite itself. A word should be
    pertinent with regard to the question of secrecy. It has become difficult for me to take
    this matter very seriously. Knowing what the secret actually is, I cannot attach much
    importance to artificial mysteries. It is true that some of the so-called secrets are
    significant, but as a rule they are so only to those who already know what the secret is.
    Again, though the secret itself is of such tremendous import, and though it is so simple
    that I could disclose it and the principal rules for turning it to the best advantage in a
    short paragraph, I might do so without doing much harm. For it cannot be used
    indiscriminately.</p>
    <p>Much fun has been made of the alchemists for insisting that the Great Work, an
    ostensibly chemical process, can only be performed by adepts who fear and love God, and
    who practise chastity and numerous other virtues. But there is more common sense in such
    statements than meets the eye. A drunken debauchee cannot perform delicate manipulations
    in chemistry or physics; and the force with which the secret is concerned, while as
    material as the Becquerel emanations, is subtler than any yet known. To play great golf or
    great billiards, to observe delicate reactions, or to conduct recondite mathematical
    researches, demands more than physical superiorities. Even the theological requirements of
    alchemy had meaning in those days. An Elizabethan who was not &quot;at peace with
    God&quot; was likely to be agitated and thereby unfitted for work demanding freedom from
    emotional distraction. I have found in practice that the secret of the O.T.O. cannot be
    used unworthily.</p>
    <p>It is interesting in this connection to recall how it came into my possession. It had
    occurred to me to write a book, <em>The Book of Lies</em>, which is also falsely called <em>Breaks</em>,
    the wanderings or falsifications of the one thought of <em>Frater Perdurabo</em> which
    thought is itself untrue.</p>
    <p>Each of its ninety-three chapters was to expound some profound magical dogma in an
    epigrammatic and sometimes humorous form. The Cabbalistic value of the number of each
    chapter was to determine its subject. I wrote one or more daily at lunch or dinner by the
    aid of the god Dionysus. One of these chapters bothered me. I could not write it. I
    invoked Dionysus with peculiar fervour, but still without success. I went off in
    desperation to &quot;change my luck&quot;, by doing something entirely contrary to my
    inclinations. In the midst of my disgust, the spirit came upon me and I scribbled the
    chapter down by the light of a farthing dip. When I read it over, I was as discontented as
    before, but I stuck it into the book in a sort of anger at myself as a deliberate act of
    spite towards my readers.</p>
    <p>Shortly after publication, the O.H.O. came to me. (At that time I did not realize that
    there was anything in the O.T.O. beyond a convenient compendium of the more important
    truths of freemasonry.) He said that</p>
    <p>{709}</p>
    <p>since I was acquainted with the supreme secret of the Order, I must be allowed the IX°
    and obligated in regard to it. I protested that I knew no such secret. He said, &quot;But
    you have printed it in the plainest language.&quot; I said that I could not have done so
    because I did not know it. He went to the bookshelves and, taking out a copy of <em>The
    Book of Lies</em>, pointed to a passage in the despised chapter. It instantly flashed upon
    me. The entire symbolism, not only of freemasonry but of many other traditions, blazed
    upon my spiritual vision. From that moment the O.T.O. assumed its proper importance in my
    mind. I understood that I held in my hands the key to the future progress of humanity. I
    applied myself at once to learn all that he could teach me, finding to my extreme surprise
    that this was little enough. He fully understood the importance of the matter and he was a
    man of considerable scientific attainment in many respects; yet he had never made a
    systematic study of the subject and had not even applied his knowledge to his purposes,
    except in rare emergencies. As soon as I was assured by experience that the new force was
    in fact capable of accomplishing the theoretically predictable results, I devoted
    practically the whole of my spare time to a course of experiments.</p>
    <p>I may conclude this chapter with the general remark that I believe that my proposals
    for reconstituting freemasonry on the lines above laid down should prove critically
    important. Civilization is crumbling under our eyes and I believe that the best chance of
    saving what little is worth saving, and rebuilding the Temple of the Holy Ghost on plans,
    and with material and workmanship, which shall be free from the errors of the former, lies
    with the O.T.O.</p>
