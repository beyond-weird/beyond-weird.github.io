    <p>I think it was on the sixth of July that I reached New York. In those days one was not
    bored by people who had never seen a real skyline boasting of the outrage since
    perpetrated by the insects. A mountain skyline is nearly always noble and beautiful, being
    the result of natural forces acting uniformly and in conformity with law. Thus, though it
    is not designed, it is the embodiment of the principles which are inherent in design. New
    York, on the other hand, has been thrown up by a series of disconnected accidents.</p>
    <p>The vanity of the natives led them therefore to concentrate their enthusiasm on a
    rejected statue of commerce intended for the Suez Canal. This they had purchased at
    secondhand and grandiloquently labelled &quot;Liberty enlightening the World&quot;. They
    had been prophetic enough to put it on an island with its back to the mainland.</p>
    <p>But, in those days, the spirit of liberty was still intensely alive in the United
    States. The least sensitive visitor was bound to become aware of it in a few hours. There
    was no genteel servility. Nobody interfered with anyone else's business or permitted
    busybodies to meddle with his. The people seemed prosperous and contented; they had not
    yet been forbidden to amuse themselves when the day's work was over.</p>
    <p>Till this time I had never been in any reputedly hot country. I was appalled to find
    New York intolerable. I filled a cold bath, and got in and out of it at intervals till
    eleven at night, when I crawled, panting, through the roasting streets and consumed
    ice-water, iced watermelon, ice-cream and iced coffee. &quot;Good God,&quot; I said to
    myself, &quot;and this is merely New York! What must Mexico be like!&quot; I supposed that
    I was experiencing normal conditions, whereas in point of fact I had landed at the climax
    of a heat wave which killed about a hundred people a day while it lasted. I should have
    discovered the truth if I had looked at a newspaper; but I did not read them. I had
    already learnt that even the finest mind is bound to perish if it suffers the infection of
    journalism. It is not merely that one defiles the mind by inflicting upon it slipshod and
    inaccurate English, shallow, commonplace, vulgar, hasty and prejudiced thought, and
    deliberate dissipation. Apart from these positive pollutions, there is the negative
    effect. To read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worth while. The natural
    laziness of the mind tempts one to eschew authors who demand a continuous effort of
    intelligence. The first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to
    feed the mind with canned chatter.</p>
    <p>{201}</p>
    <p>People tell me that they must read the papers so as to know what is going on. In the
    first place, they could hardly find a worse guide. Most of what is printed turns out to be
    false, sooner or later. Even when there is no deliberate deception, the account must, from
    the nature of the case, be presented without adequate reflection and must seem to possess
    an importance which time shows to be absurdly exaggerated; or vice versa. No event can be
    fairly judged without background and perspective.</p>
    <p>I only stayed in New York two or three days and then travelled direct to Mexico City.
    It was my first experience of a really long journey by train. The psychology is very
    curious. Journeys of more than half an hour begin to be tedious. Edinburgh to Inverness: I
    used to feel on the verge of insanity before I had got half way. But after two or three
    days in the train one becomes acclimatized.</p>
    <p>The city of Mexico began by irritating me intensely. The hotel had no organized
    service; they didn't seem to care whether one got anything to eat or not. In fact, in the
    whole city, there was only one restaurant where one could get anything outside the regular
    local dishes. Nobody bothers about eating. The same applies to drinking, as far as the
    palate is concerned. People ate to satisfy hunger and drank to get drunk. There were no
    fine vintages; the principal drinks were pulque, which is the fermented sap of the aloe;
    mescal, tequila and aguardiente; the last being a general term applicable to any distilled
    spirit. In those days I was practically an abstainer, and as I had a fastidious daintiness
    which made me dislike trying experiments, I never even sampled any of these drinks.</p>
    <p>It is a very curious trait. I used to refuse, sometimes under embarrassing pressure, to
    taste things whose appearance or whose name displeased me. I would not eat jam, even as a
    child, because it looked messy. I must have been nearly forty before I would touch salad.
    It seems absurd. I was very bond of lobster mayonnaise; but lobster salad, never! I
    dislike the combination of consonants. The word suggests something indefinite. It gives
    the effect of French poetry, where the absence of accentuation emasculates the rhythm.</p>
    <p>I found myself spiritually at home with Mexicans. The despise industry and commerce.
    They had Diaz to do their political thinking for them and damned well he did it. Their
    hearts are set on bull fighting, cock fighting, gambling and lechery. Their spirit is
    brave and buoyant; it had not been poisoned by hypocrisy and the struggle for life. I
    hired part of a house overlooking the Alameda, a magnificent park intended for pleasure
    and protected from the police. I engaged a young Indian girl to look after me and settled
    down to steady work at Magick. I had an introduction to an old man named Don Jesus Medina,
    a descendant of the great duke of Armada fame, and one of the highest chiefs of Scottish</p>
    <p>{202}</p>
    <p>rite free-masonry. My Cabbalistic knowledge being already profound by current
    standards, he thought me worthy of the highest initiation in his power to confer; special
    powers were obtained in view of my limited sojourn, and I was pushed rapidly through and
    admitted to the thirty-third and last degree before I left the country.</p>
    <p>I had also a certain amount of latitude granted by Mathers to initiate suitable people <em>in
    partibus</em>. I, therefore, established an entirely new Order of my own, called L.I.L.:
    the &quot;Lamp of the Invisible Light&quot;. Don Jesus became its first High Priest. In
    the Order L.I.L., the letters L.P.D. are the monograms of the mysteries. An explanation of
    these letter is given by Dumas in the prologue of his <em>Memoirs of a Physician</em>, and
    Eliphas Lévi discusses them at some length. I, however, remembered them directly from my
    incarnation as Cagliostro. It would be improper to communicate their significance to the
    profane, but I may say that the political interpretation given by Dumas is superficial,
    and the ethical suggestions of Lévi puerile and perverse; or, more correctly,
    intentionally misleading. They conceal a number of magical formulae of minor importance by
    major practical value, and the curious should conduct such research as they feel impelled
    to make in the light of the Cabbala. Their numerical values, Yetziratic attributions, and
    the arcana of the Atus of Tahuti, supply an adequate clue to such intelligences as are
    enlightened by sympathy and sincerity.</p>
    <p>The general idea was to have an ever-burning lamp in a temple furnished with talismans
    appropriate to the elemental, planetary and zodiacal forces of nature. Daily invocations
    were to be performed with the object of making the light itself a consecrated centre or
    focus of spiritual energy. This light would then radiate and automatically enlighten such
    minds as were ready to receive it.</p>
    <p>Even today, the experiment seems to me interesting and the conception sublime. I am
    rather sorry that I lost touch with don Jesus; I should like very much to know how it
    turned out.</p>
    <p>I devoted practically my whole time to this and other magical work. I devised a Ritual
    of Self-Initiation (see <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I,
    no. III, p.269</a>), the essential feature of which is the working up of spiritual
    enthusiasm by means of a magical dance. This dance contained the secret gestures of my
    grade, combined with the corresponding words. I used to set my will against the tendency
    to giddiness and thus postpone as long as possible the final physical intoxication. In
    this way I lost consciousness at a moment when I was wholly absorbed in aspiration. Thus,
    instead of falling into dull darkness, I emerged into a lucid state, in which I was purged
    of personality and all sensory or intellectual impressions. I became the vehicle of the
    divine forces invoked and so experienced Godhead. My results were satisfactory so far as
    they went; but they did not aid my personal progress very much,</p>
    <p>{203}</p>
    <p>since I had not formulated an intellectual link between the divine and human
    consciousness.</p>
    <p>I worked also at acquiring the power of invisibility. (See <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, no. III</a>, p. 272 for the ritual.) I reached a
    point when my physical reflection in a mirror became faint and flickering. It gave very
    much the effect of the interrupted images of the cinematograph in its early days. But the
    real secret of invisibility is not concerned with the laws of optics at all; the trick is
    to prevent people noticing you when they would normally do so. In this I was quite
    successful. For example, I was able to take a walk in the street in a golden crown and a
    scarlet robe without attracting attention.</p>
    <p>Most interesting of all, perhaps, is a magical practice which I devised, ostensibly to
    deal with the dilemma propounded by the Sphinx: &quot;The postulant to Magic must be
    morally perfect.&quot; It may be that I felt instinctively that my pious predecessors were
    wrong in demanding the suppression of manhood and imposing arbitrary codes of conduct. (I
    know now, of course, that their instructions have been misunderstood; every element in
    one's molecule must be developed to the utmost and applied to the service of one's true
    will.) I suppose I have to thank Stevenson for the idea, which was this. As a member of
    the Second Order, I wore a certain jewelled ornament of gold upon my heart. I arranged
    that when I had it on, I was to permit no thought, word or action, save such as pertained
    directly to my magical aspirations. When I took it off I was, on the contrary, to permit
    no such things; I was to be utterly uninitiate. It was like Jekyll and Hyde, but with the
    two personalities balanced and complete in themselves. I found this practice of very great
    service. It was in fact essentially a beginning of systematic control of thought. The
    method is now incorporated in the instructions of the A.'. A.'. (See <em>Liber Jugorum</em></a>.)</p>
    <p>Mexico proved a glorious galloping ground for my Pegasus. The magnificent mountain air,
    the splendour of the sun, the flamboyant beauty of the flowers, the intoxicating intimacy
    of leaping, fearless love which flamed in every face made my mind a racing rhythm of
    rapture.</p>
    <p>Yet my principal achievement had its roots in Europe. At one of Mathers' semi-public
    ceremonies, I had met a member of the Order, an American prima donna. She took me by storm
    and we became engaged. The marriage could not take place immediately, as she had to get
    rid of some husband that she had left lying about in Texas. But I heard her sing Venus in <em>Tannhäuser</em>
    at Covent Garden; and she courteously insisted on my sampling the goods with which she
    proposed to endow me. The romance of an intrigue with so famous an artist excited my
    imagination. One afternoon, in Mexico, I picked up a woman who attracted me by the
    insatiable intensity of passion that blazed from her evil inscrutable eyes and tortured
    her worn face into a whirlpool of seductive sin. I passes some hours with her in her slum;</p>
    <p>{204}</p>
    <p>and, walking home, found myself still so unappeased --- <em>lassatus, sed non satiatus</em>
    --- that my fever developed a delirium whose images assumed the form of Wagner's opera. I
    went home and sat down at once to write my own poetical and magical version of the story.
    I neither slept nor ate till it was finished --- sixty-seven hours later. I had not been
    aware of the flight of time. I could not understand why it was afternoon; I thought that I
    had merely written all night. This play marks the climax of the first period of my poetry.</p>
    <p>During the summer I wanted to travel in the interior. I went down to Iguala, bought an
    orange pony and rode slowly back to the city, taking things as they came. In all my
    travels I have hardly ever &quot;seen the sights&quot;. Nothing is so disappointing. My
    plan is simply to live in any new city the ordinary life of the people. I wander about and
    presently come unexpectedly upon one of the wonders of the world. In this way one gets the
    thrill which those who have sold their souls to Baedeker miss. Imagine the delight of
    discovering the Coliseum or the Taj Mahal for oneself, at a moment, perhaps, when one's
    mind was preoccupied with commonplace ideas! I may have missed a few masterpieces, but not
    many; and people who go to see them on purpose miss them all altogether.</p>
    <p>The maximum of romance and pleasure is to be found in Mexico, even in the quite small
    provincial towns. There is always some sort of Alameda, a well-wooded square more or less
    in the middle of the town with seats in any number, and a bandstand where a band plays
    every night without any swank, because people like music. It is never too hot; there is
    usually a pleasant breeze, enough to stir the leaves and not enough to disturb and annoy.
    It is full of men and women; all seem young and all are charming, spontaneous and ready to
    make any desired kind of love.</p>
    <p>In fact, they are making it continually in their hearts and only wait opportunity to
    suit the word and action to the thought. Nor does opportunity lag. There are no practical
    difficulties. Indoors and out nature and art combine to invite Cupid to pay every kind of
    visit, passionate, permanent, transitory, trivial. The caprice of the moment is the sole
    arbiter of the event. The idea of worry is unknown. &quot;Take no thought for the
    morrow&quot; is the first principle of human relations, especially in regard to all such
    matters. Love is the business of life, but it is all profit and no loss. There is no false
    shame, no contamination by ideas of commerce and material matters in general. There is no
    humbug about purity, uplift, idealism, or any such nonsense. I cannot hope to express the
    exquisite pleasure of freedom. One's spontaneity was not destroyed by anticipations of all
    sorts of difficulty in finding a friend of any desired type, obstacles in the way of
    consummating the impulse, and unpleasantness in the aftermath. The problem of sex, which
    has reduced Anglo-Saxon nations to hysteria and insanity, has been</p>
    <p>{205}</p>
    <p>solved in Mexico by the co-operation of climate and cordiality. Even Catholicism has
    lost most of its malignancy in Mexico. Clergy and laity unite, spiritually and
    somatically, with gay ardour. The Virgin is here actually the <em>fille-mère</em> which
    the gospels really represent, for all our blustering denial of the obvious facts. Of
    course, the priest likes a little gratification for his complaisance, but that is a very
    human trait, and as he is neither greedy, malicious, nor hypocritical, the charity which
    he enjoys is given freely in the friendliest spirit.</p>
    <p>This was because he had Diaz 33° to keep him in order. After Diaz's death, the priest
    got gay on a bellyful of --- (the Host?) like the world-famous Sparrow and had to be
    curbed seriously, as history relates.</p>
    <p>My fist night out of Iguala was a mysterious delight. I had lost my way in a sugar
    plantation and it was getting dark when I came to a railway in course of construction. I
    followed this, hoping to find a town, but night fell, sudden and black; so I tethered my
    horse and lay down to sleep in my poncho by the light of a fire, to make which I borrowed
    some loose material left by the engineers. Dawn was just breaking when I was awakened from
    sleep by that subtle sense of danger which protects sleeping wayfarers. In the dim light I
    saw three heads peering at me over the embankment. I fired my revolver in the air; the
    heads disappeared; I turned over and went to sleep again instantly for several hours.</p>
    <p>My second night was otherwise amusing. I struck a pioneer camp, where a wooden hut had
    been thrown together. Two Chinamen were running an eating house. I sat down to dinner with
    two of the engineers. They spotted the new chum and began to scare me with tales of
    scorpions and fever. Before serving dinner, one of the Chinese came in with a saucepan of
    boiling water and went round the room tipping it into the cavities formed by the crossing
    of the timbers of the hut. As often as not, a scalded scorpion fell out. I went to bet
    that night with my mind full of a particularly unpleasant trick of my reptilian brothers.
    They have a habit of dropping from the roof on to one's bed. This is quite without malice,
    but one stirs in one's sleep at the touch. The are alarmed and strike. This didn't happen;
    but in the morning I found my legs so swollen from mosquito bites that I could not get my
    boots one. The result was my first acquaintance with malaria, which attacked me very
    severely shortly after I got back to the city. My ride was full of very varied adventure.
    The incident that stands out is this:</p>
    <p>Crossing a hillside, I saw a Mexican some thirty yards below the track, apparently
    asleep in the sun. I thought I would warn him of his danger and rode over. He must have
    been dead three weeks, for he had been completely mummified. Neither the coyotes nor the
    turkey-buzzards will touch a dead Mexican. His flesh has been too thoroughly impregnated
    with chillies and other pungent condiments. The make short work of any other meat. I</p>
    <p>{206}</p>
    <p>remember riding out from Zapotlan to lunch with some friends on their ranch. I fell in
    with a string of mules bound for the Pacific coast. As I passed a mule dropped from
    exhaustion. The men transferred his pack and left him to die. Returning after lunch, some
    three hours later, I found the bones of the mule picked clean and dry.</p>
    <p>One can always tell a Mexican by his peculiar habit of blowing through his cigarette
    before lighting it. The reason for this is that the government cigarettes are rolled by
    convicts, who are allowed what they consider an inadequate amount of tobacco daily for
    their own use. They therefore increase their supply by mixing dust with the tobacco handed
    out to them every morning for their work, and one therefore has to blow it out.</p>
    <p>It is said, I know not how truly, that a Mexican town, in a corner near the Rio Grande,
    was, in the course of the revolution and counter- revolution of the contending vultures in
    1917, cut off for a time from all communication with the rest of the country. Presumably
    everyone buried whatever cash he happened to have. At least it vanished rapidly and
    strangely. The city gasped. What the devil was to be done? Being folk of sense, they soon
    collected their wits and said: &quot;All right. It's no good crying for the moon. We've
    got to go on exchanging wealth. We'll simply barter on credit and strike a weekly balance.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;If anyone fancies he's got a soft thing ---<br>
          If we haven't got pesos we've plenty of string.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The result was surprising. Business went on pretty well as in the past, with this
    remarkable difference: the motive for cheating and hording and gambling was gone. One
    could, of course, amass a fortune on the balance sheet of the town council; but it would
    be hard to cash in. So nobody troubled to outwit his neighbour or plot his ruin. They
    contented themselves with aiming at comfort and ease. Old enemies became fast friends; the
    usurers turned their hands to productive purposes; the loafers and spongers and gamblers
    realized that they must work or starve. The whole town prospered; poverty disappeared;
    financial anxiety ceased to exist; the moral tone of the community became almost angelic.
    Everyone had plenty to do, plenty to eat, plenty of leisure and plenty of pleasure.
    Everyone was happy. Of course it was too good to last. Communications were restored and a
    month later society had relapsed into a dog-fight for dollars.</p>
