    <p>I had naturally no idea at the time that the death of my father would make any
    practical difference to my environment. In most similar cases it probably would not have
    done so. Most widows naturally remain in the groove.</p>
    <p>As things were, I found myself in a totally new environment. My father's religious
    opinions had tended to alienate him from his family; and the friends whom he had made in
    his own circle had no interest in visiting my mother. I was thrown into the atmosphere of
    her family. She moved to London in order to be near her brother, whom till then I had
    hardly met.</p>
    <p>Tom Bond Bishop was a prominent figure in religious and philanthropic circles in
    London. He held a more or less important position in the Custom House, but had no
    ambitions connected with the Civil Service. He devoted the whole of this spare time and
    energy to the propagation of the extraordinarily narrow, ignorant and bigoted
    Evangelicalism in which he believed. He had founded the Children's Scripture Union and the
    Children's Special Service Mission. The former dictates to children what passages of the
    Bible they shall read daily: the latter drags them from their play at the seaside and
    hands them over to the ravings of pious undergraduates or hired gospel-geysers. Within his
    limits, he was a man of acute intelligence and great executive and organizing ability. A
    Manning plus bigoted sincerity; a Cotton Mather minus imagination; one might even say a
    Paul deprived of logical ability, and this defect supplied by invulnerable cocksureness.
    He was inaccessible to doubt; he <em>knew</em> that he was <em>right</em> on every point.</p>
    <p>I once put it to him: suppose a climber roped to another who has fallen. He cannot save
    him and must fall also unless he cut the rope. What should he do? My uncle replied,
    &quot;God would never allow a man to be placed in such a position´!!!! This unreason made
    him mentally and morally lower than the cattle of the fields. He obeyed blind savage
    impulses and took them for the sanctions of the Almighty.</p>
    <p>&quot;To the lachrymal glands of a crocodile he added the bowels of compassion of a
    cast-iron rhinoceros; with the meanness and cruelty of a eunuch he combined the
    calculating avarice of a Scotch Jew, without the whisky of the one or the sympathetic
    imagination of the other. Perfidious and hypocritical as the Jesuit of Protestant fable,
    he was unctuous as Uriah Heep, and for the rest possessed the vices of Joseph Surface and
    Tartuffe; yet, being without the human weaknesses which make them possible, he was a more
    virtuous, and therefore a more odious, villain.</p>
    <p>{54}</p>
    <p>&quot;In feature resembling a shaven ape, in figure a dislocated dachshund, his
    personal appearance was at the first glance unattractive. But the clothes made by a City
    tailor lent such general harmony to the whole as to reconcile the observer to the
    phenomenon observed.</p>
    <p>&quot;Of unrivalled cunning, his address was plausible; he concealed his genius under a
    mask of matchless mediocrity and his intellectual force under the cloak of piety. In
    religion he was an Evangelical, that type of Nonconformist who remains in the Church in
    the hope of capturing its organization and its revenues.</p>
    <p>&quot;An associate of such creatures of an inscrutable Providence as Coote and Torrey,
    he surpassed the one in sanctimoniousness, the other in bigotry, though he always thought
    blackmail too risky and slander a tactical error<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>No more cruel fanatic, no meaner villain, ever walked this earth. My father,
    wrong-headed as he was, had humanity and a certain degree of common-sense; he had a
    logical mind and never confused spiritual with material issues. He could never have
    believed, like my uncle, that the cut and colour of &quot;Sunday clothes&quot; could be a
    matter of importance to the Deity. Having decided that faith and not works was essential
    to salvation, he could not attach any vital importance to works. With him, the reason for
    refraining from sin was simply that it showed ingratitude to the Saviour. In the case of
    the sinner, it was almost a hopeful sign that he should sin thoroughly. He was more likely
    to reach that conviction of sin which would show him his need of salvation. The material
    punishment of sin (again) was likely to bring him to his knees. Good works in the sinner
    were worthless. &quot;All our righteousness is as filthy rags.&quot; It was the devil's
    favourite trick to induce people to rely on their good character. The parable of the
    pharisee and the publican taught this clearly enough.</p>
    <p>I do not know whether my Uncle Tom could have found any arguments against this theory,
    but in practice he had a horror of what he called sin which was exaggerated almost to the
    point of insanity. His talents, I may almost say his genius<strong>2</strong>, gave him
    tremendous influence. In his own house he was a ruthless, petty tyrant; and it was into
    this den of bitter slavery that I was suddenly hurled from my position of fresh air,
    freedom and heirship.</p>
    <p>He lived in London, in what was then called Thistle Grove. The name has since been
    changed to Drayton Gardens, despite a petition enthusiastically supported by Bishop; the
    objection was that a public house in the neighbourhood was called the Drayton Arms. This
    is typical of my uncle's attitude to life. His sense of humour. When I called him
    &quot;Uncle&quot;, he would</p>
    <p>{55}</p>
    <p>snigger, &quot;Oh my prophetic soul, my uncle!&quot; But the time came when I knew most
    of <em>Hamlet</em> by heart, and when he next shot off his &quot;joke&quot;, I continued
    the quotation, replying sternly, &quot;Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast!&quot;
    --- I am, in a way, glad to think that at the end of his long and obscene life I was
    reconciled with him. The very last letter he ever received from me admitted (if a little
    grudgingly) that his mind was so distorted that he had really no idea how vile a thing he
    was. I think this must have stirred his sense of shame. At least, I never received any
    answer.</p>
    <p>I suppose that the household at Thistle Grove was as representative of one part of
    England as could possibly have been imagined. It was nondescript. It was neither upper nor
    lower middle-class. It had not sufficient individuality even to belong to a category. My
    grandmother was a particularly charming old lady. She was inexpressibly dignified in her
    black silks and her lace cap. She had been imported from the country by the exigencies of
    her son's position in the Civil Service. She was extremely lovable; I never remember
    hearing a cross word fall from her. She was addicted to the infamous vice of bezique. It
    was, of course, impossible to have &quot;The Devil's Picture Books&quot; in a house
    frequented by the leading lights of Evangelicalism. But my Aunt Ada had painted a pack of
    cards in which the suits were roses, violets, etc. It was the same game; but the
    camouflage satisfied my uncle's conscience. No pharisee ever scoured the outside of the
    cup and platter more assiduously than he.</p>
    <p>My grandmother was the second wife of her husband; of the first marriage there were two
    surviving children; Anne, a stout and sensual old maid, who always filled me with intense
    physical repulsion; she was shiny and greasy with a blob nose and thick wet lips. Every
    night she tucked a bottle of stout under her arm and took it to bed with her --- adding
    this invariable &quot;joke&quot; --- &quot;My baby!&quot; Even today, when people happen
    to drink stout at a table where I am sitting, I manage instinctively not to see it.</p>
    <p>Her brother John had lived for many years in Australia in enjoyment of wealth and civic
    distinction. His wealth failed when his health broke; and he returned to England to live
    with the family. He was a typical hardy out-door man with all the colonial freedom of
    thought, speech and manner. He found himself in the power of his half-brother's acrid
    code. He had to smoke his pipe by stealth and he was bullied about his soul until his mind
    gave way. At family prayers he was perpetually being prayed at; his personality being
    carefully described lest the Lord should mistake his identity. The description would have
    suited the average murderer as observed by a singularly uncharitable pacifist.</p>
    <p>I am particularly proud of myself for the way I behaved to him. It was impossible to
    help liking the simple-minded genial soul of the man. I remember one day at Streatham,
    after he and my grandmother had come</p>
    <p>{56}</p>
    <p>to live with us, that I tried to cheer him up. Shaking all over, he explained to me
    almost in tears that he was afraid he was &quot;not all right with Christ&quot;. I look
    back almost with incredulity upon myself. It was not I that spoke; I answered him with
    brusque authority, though I was a peculiarly shy boy not yet sixteen. I told him plainly
    that the whole thing was nonsense, that Christ was a fable, that there was no such thing
    as sin, and that he ought to thank his stars that he had lived his whole life away from
    the hypocritical crew of trembling slaves who believed in such nonsense. Already my
    unconscious self was singing in my ears that terrific climax of Browning's
    &quot;Renan-chorus&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Oh, dread succession to a dizzy post,<br>
        Sad sway of sceptre whose mere touch appals,<br>
        Ghastly dethronement, cursed by those the most<br>
        On whose repugnant brow the crown next falls!</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, he became melancholy-mad; and died in that condition. I remember writing to my
    mother and my uncle that they were guilty of &quot;murder most foul as in the best it is;
    but this most foul, strange and unnatural&quot;.</p>
    <p>I lay weight upon this episode because my attitude, as I remember it, seems
    imcompatible with my general spiritual life of the period, as will appear later.</p>
    <p>I was genuinely fond of my Aunt Ada. She was womanly in the oldfashioned sense of the
    word; a purely passive type. Naturally talented though she was, she was both ignorant and
    bigoted. In her situation, she could not have been anything else. But her opinions did not
    interfere with her charity. A woman of infinite kindness. Her health was naturally
    delicate; an attack of rheumatic fever had damaged her heart and she died before her time.
    The meanness and selfishness of my Uncle Tom were principally responsible. He would not
    engage a secretary; he forced her to slave for the Scripture Union and it killed her.</p>
    <p>One anecdote throws a curious light upon my character in these early days and also
    reveals her as possessed of a certain sense of humour. Some years before, on the platform
    at Redhill with my father, I had seen on the bookstall <em>Across Patagonia</em> by Lady
    Florence Dixie. The long name fascinated me; I begged him to buy it for me and he did. The
    name stuck and I decided to be King of Patagonia. Psycho-analysts will learn with pleasure
    that the name of my capital was Margaragstagregorstoryaka. &quot;Margar&quot; was derived
    from Margaret, queen of Henry VI, who was my favourite character in history. This is
    highly significant, as indicating the type of woman that I have always admired. I want her
    to be wicked, independent, courageous, ambitious, and so on. I cannot place the
    &quot;ragstag&quot;, but it is probably euphonic.</p>
    <p>{57}</p>
    <p>&quot;Gregor&quot; is, of course, my cousin; &quot;story&quot; is what was then my
    favourite form of amusement. I cannot place the &quot;yaka&quot;, but that again is
    probably euphonic.</p>
    <p>I cannot imagine why, at this very early age, I cultivated a profound aversion to, and
    contempt for, Queen Victoria. Merely, perhaps, the clean and decent instinct of a child! I
    announced my intention of leading the forces of Patagonia against her. One day my Aunt Ada
    took me to tea at Gunters'; and an important-looking official document was handed to me.
    It was Queen Victoria's reply. She was going to blow my capital to pieces and treat me
    personally in a very unpleasant manner. This document was sealed with a label marked with
    an anchor to suggest naval frightfulness, taken for this purpose from the end of a reel of
    cotton. But I took the document quite seriously and was horribly frightened.</p>
    <p>The dinginess of my uncle's household, the atmosphere of severe disapproval of the
    universe in general, and the utter absence of the spirit of life, combined to make me
    detest my mother's family. There was, incidentally, a grave complication, for my father's
    death had increased the religious bigotry of my mother very greatly; and although she was
    so fond of her family, she was bound to regard them as very doubtful candidates for
    heaven. This attitude was naturally inexplicable to a child of such tender years; and the
    effect on me was to develop an almost petulant impatience with the whole question of
    religion. My Aunt Ada was my mother's favourite sister; yet at her funeral she refused to
    enter the church during the service and waited outside in the rain, only rejoining the
    procession when the corpse repassed those accurs&#138;d portals on its way to the
    cemetery. She stood by the grave while the parson read the service. It was apparently the
    architectural diabolism to which she most objected.</p>
    <p>There was also an objection to the liturgy, on numerous grounds. It seems incredible,
    but is true, that the Plymouth Brethren regarded the Lord's Prayer as a &quot;vain
    repetition, as do the heathen&quot;. It was forbidden to use it! Jesus had indeed given
    this prayer as an example of how to pray; but everyone was expected to make up his own
    supplications ex tempore.</p>
    <p>The situation resulted in a very amusing way. Having got to the point of saying.
    &quot;Evil, be thou my good,&quot; I racked my brains to discover some really abominable
    crimes to do. In a moment of desperate daring I sneaked one Sunday morning into the church
    frequented by my Uncle Tom on Streatham Common, prepared, so to speak, to wallow in it. It
    was one of the most bitter disappointments of my life! I could not detect anything which
    satisfied my ideas of damnation.</p>
    <p>For a year or two after my father's death my mother did not seem to settle down; and
    during the holidays we either stayed with Bishop or wandered in hotels and hydros. I think
    she was afraid of bringing me up</p>
    <p>{58}</p>
    <p>in London; but when my uncle moved to Streatham she compromised by taking a house in
    Polwarth Road. I hated it, because there were bigger houses in the neighbourhood.</p>
    <p>I am not quite sure whether I am the most outrageous snob that ever lived, or whether I
    am not a snob at all. The truth of the matter is, I think, that I will not acquiesce in
    anything but the very best of its kind. I don't in the least mind going without a thing
    altogether, but if I have it at all it has got to be AI. England is a very bad place for
    me. I cannot endure people who are either superior or inferior to others, but only those
    who, whatever their station in life, are consciously unique and supreme. In the East,
    especially among Mohammedans, one can make friends with the very coolies; they respect
    themselves and others. They are gentlemen. But in England the spirit of independence is
    rare. Men of high rank and position nearly always betray consciousness of inferiority to,
    and dependence upon, others. Snobbishness, in this sense, is so widely spread that I
    rarely feel at home, unless with a supreme genius like Augustus John.</p>
    <p>Aubrey Tanqueray is typical. He must not forfeit the esteem of his &quot;little
    Parish&quot;, and avoids mortification by shifting from one parish to another. When Paula
    asks him. &quot;Do you trouble yourself about what servants <em>think</em>? he answers,
    &quot;Of course.&quot; If one had to worry about one's actions in respect of other
    people's ideas, one might as well be buried alive in an antheap or married to an ambitious
    violinist. Whether that man is the prime minister, modifying his opinions to catch votes,
    or a bourgeois in terror lest some harmless act should be misunderstood and outrage some
    petty convention, that man is an inferior man and I do not want to have anything to do
    with him any more than I want to eat canned salmon. Of course the world forces us all to
    compromise with our environment to some extent, and we only waste our strength if we fight
    pitched battles for points which are not worth a skirmish. It is only a faddist who
    refuses to conform with conventions of dress and the like. But our sincerity should be
    Roman about things that really matter to us. And I am still in doubt, as I write these
    words, as to how far it is right to employ strategy and diplomacy in order to gain one's
    point. The great men of the world have stood up and taken their medicine. Bradlaugh and
    Burton did not lose in the end by being downright. I never approved the super- subtlety of
    Huxley's campaign against Gladstone; and as for Swinburne, he died outright when he became
    respectable. Adaptation to one's environment makes for a sort of survival; but after all,
    the supreme victory is only won by those who prove themselves of so much hardier stuff
    than the rest that no power on earth is able to destroy them. The people who have really
    made history are the martyrs.</p>
    <p>I suppose that there comes to all of us only too often the feeling which</p>
    <p>{59}</p>
    <p>Freud calls the OEdipus complex. We want to repose, to be at peace with our fellows
    whom we love, who misunderstand us and for whose love we are hungry. We want to make
    terms, we want to surrender. But I have always found that, though I could acquiesce in
    some such line of conduct, though I could make all preparations for accommodation, yet
    when it came to the point, I was utterly unable to do the base, irrevocable act. I cannot
    even do evil that good may come. I abhor Jesuitry. I would rather lose than win by
    strategem. The utmost that I have been able to manage is to consent to put forward my
    principles in a form which will not openly outrage ordinary susceptibilities. Bit I feel
    so profoundly the urgency of doing my will that it is practically impossible for me to
    write on Shakespeare and the musical Glasses without introducing the spiritual and moral
    principles which are the only things in myself that I can identify with myself.</p>
    <p>This characteristic is evidently inherited from my father. His integrity was absolute.
    He lived entirely by his theological convictions. Christ might return at any moment.
    &quot;Even as the lightning lighteneth out of the East and lighteneth even unto the West,
    so is the coming of the Son of Man.&quot; He would have to give an account of &quot;every
    idle word&quot;. It was a horrifying thought to him that he might be caught by the Second
    Advent at a moment when he was not actively and intensely engaged on the work which God
    had sent him into the world to do. This sense of the importance of the lightest act, of
    the value of every moment, has been a tragically intense factor in my life. I have always
    grudged the time necessary for eating, sleeping and dressing. I have invented costumes
    with the sole object of minimizing the waste of time<strong>3</strong> and the distraction
    of attention involved. I never wear underclothing. The &quot;Magnetism&quot; of men and
    women has for its physical basis sweat: in health this is sparse and very fragrant. Any
    defect should be instantly remedied: there is no surer danger sign than foul or unduly
    profuse perspiration.</p>
    <p>This quality determined much of my life at school. I instinctively understood that I
    did not want academic knowledge as such; but since I was under duress, the best plan for
    avoiding interruption was to acquit myself well in class and in examination. I had no
    ambitions; but I invariably set myself to acquire the necessary knowledge with the minimum
    of exertion. My natural abilities, especially my memory, made this easy. I soon discovered
    that to distinguish myself in school was in the nature of a conjurer's trick. It is hard
    to analyse my method or to be sure of the analysis; but I think the essence of the plan
    was to make certain of the minimum required and to add a superstructure of one or two
    abstruse points which I would</p>
    <p>{60}</p>
    <p>manage to bring to the notice of the master or the examiner so as to give him the idea
    that I had prepared myself with unusual thoroughness.</p>
    <p>It occurs to me that this confession sounds rather strange, after my previous remarks
    about integrity. My justification is that I considered schoolmasters as importunate and
    possibly dangerous beggars. I was not in a position to fight; and I could not afford a
    good sixpence, so I put them off with a bad one. It was their own fault for plaguing me.</p>
