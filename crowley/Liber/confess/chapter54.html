    <p>The voyage to Rangoon was uneventful and delightful. The weather was perfect; for a
    wonder, the shores and spine of western Burma were on show. There was a fearful
    fascination in those deadly beauties. I cursed again the fate that had driven me back in
    1902 from the sombre slopes of the Arakans. I had rather I had left my bones to Bleach
    upon those pestilential peaks.</p>
    <p>Yet my mind --- thanks be to the most high eternal gods! --- can never rest for more
    than an albatross's glide upon the slopes of the past. Today, writing my memories, I feel
    as if I were playing a sort of practical joke upon myself. I am hot on the trail of the
    future. I can imagine myself on my deathbed, spent utterly with lust to touch the next
    world, like a boy asking for his first kiss from a woman.</p>
    <p>Beyond Burma lay mysterious China; I conjured up a cloud of amusing phantasies. Romance
    and adventure. I am incurable; though I have had all the good thinks of life, nearly all
    my life, though I no longer value them or enjoy them for themselves, I still enjoy the
    idea of them. I embrace hardship and privation with ecstatic delight; I want everything
    that the world holds; I would go to prison or to the scaffold for the sake of the
    experience. I have never grown out of the infantile belief that the universe was made for
    me to suck. I grow delirious to contemplate the delicious horrors that are certain to
    happen to me. This is the keynote of my life, the untrammelled delight in every
    possibility of existence, potential or actual. Fear had been eliminated from me by the
    fact that I look back with the keenest interest and pleasure to the events which at the
    time were torture unassuaged.</p>
    <p>Imagine, then, how I gloried in the low of the silken waters about the ship, in the
    fantastically immaterial outlines of the Arakan hills, in the gloom of the gracious
    frondage of the forests, in the curves of the cobra coast, in the sinister stories of
    wreck and piracy which haunt that desolate abyss through which we were steaming, where for
    nine months of the year one can scarce distinguish between sky and sea, so dark and damp
    is the air, so subtly steaming the swell of ocean; while beyond, as in a hashish dream,
    arose the highlands of china, provinces all but unknown even to civilized Chinese
    themselves. There, primrose to purple, was the promise of undreamed-of tribes of men,
    strangely tattooed and dressed, with awful customs and mysterious rites, beyond
    imagination and yet brutally actual, folk with sublimity carven of simplicity and
    depravity woven of the most complex madness.</p>
    <p>{460}</p>
    <p>I went toward China, my veins bursting with some colossal bliss that I had never yet
    experienced. I boiled with love for the unknown, the more so that my brain was overcharged
    with grisly imaginings bred of Octave Mirbeau's <em>Le Jardin des Supplices</em>, combined
    with fervid actualities born of the feeling that I was (after all) treading, though
    reverently and afar off, in the footsteps of my boyhood's hero, Richard Francis Burton.</p>
    <p>The approaches to Rangoon are of the most turbulent kind. The river is always the same
    violent angry dirty flood. It seems to be desperately annoyed with itself about something,
    possibly at having to pass through Rangoon, which is a wretchedly provincial and
    artificial town, saved from utter insignificance by one crowing glory, the Shwe Dagon
    pagoda.</p>
    <p>The Buddhists of Burma cannot be induced to do anything which might contribute to their
    welfare or that of their religion; but they are ridiculously lavish in building new
    dagobas or regilding old ones. Shortly before my arrival an immense sum of money had been
    collected to lay plate of pure gold on the Htee of the Shwe Dagon, and while this
    operation was in progress, a tigress indiscreetly walked into the city one night, climbed
    the scaffolding and was shot by an Englishman. The outrage to the community, which objects
    to the slaying, even by accident, of an insect, was causing serious political trouble.
    Their most holy shrine defiled by deliberate murder! There was also considerable friction
    between the petty English authorities and the Buddhist ponggis of European extraction who
    were trying to settle in Rangoon, live the holy life and revive Buddhism as a missionary
    religion. European officials in a colony are necessarily nuisances to themselves; the
    consequently try to pass it on to somebody else, on the principle of school bullies ---
    the prototype of the administration.</p>
    <p>I personally met with the greatest courtesy and kindness from the authorities in Burma,
    but the country is not so settled socially as India, and the climate is so abominable that
    there is every excuse for irritability on the part of anyone unfortunate enough to have to
    live there. It is, however, a pity that the administration should look with such
    provincial suspicion upon people like Allan Bennett, that they should fancy political
    dangers when a European chooses to study native religion. This disfavour extended to their
    own officials whenever they happened to have sufficient intelligence to take a sympathetic
    interest in the people and their customs and beliefs. Fielding Hall, a judge, found
    himself quite unpopular in official circles on account of his excellent though somewhat
    sentimental book <em>The Soul of a People</em>.</p>
    <p>The Englishman in all the colonies that I have visited, except in India, which is not a
    colony, is childishly jealous of his supposed superiority to the native. He has convinced
    himself that he represents a step ahead in evolution and he is fantastically afraid of
    &quot;going fanti&quot;; so he has his knife into anyone who has a good word to say for
    the people.</p>
    <p>{461}</p>
    <p>Allan Bennett</a>, by becoming a Buddhist monk, was a
    lining witness that some Europeans thought Burmese beliefs better than their European
    equivalents; and the idea --- so far as an idea may be ascribed to an official --- was
    that native agitators might use this as an argument that British rule in Burma was
    unjustified. The whole ratiocination is an utter muddle; but men are not governed by
    reason, either individually or politically. There is, therefore, some excuse for the
    anxiety of the administration.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the example of India should have been enough. British prestige in
    India rested on the real moral superiority of courage, truthfulness, justice an
    self-control. It has been destroyed by the attempt to replace this irrational lever of
    iron by the rotten laths of reason. We should never have shown our weakness to the Indian
    student who fills Bengal with the tale of his sexual conquest of white women, our servant
    girls who took these sons of pettifoggers for princes. We should never have sent out
    middle-class pets-of-examiners to govern the aristocratically minded inhabitants of the
    tongue of Asia. Duxmia --- I suspect some very wise bird --- wrote in <em>Vanity Fair</em>
    (October 13th, 1907):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The British Empire was not built up by public school boys, for the excellent and all
      sufficient reason that while it was really being built up the public schools did not
      exist. The men who defeated Napoleon and crushed the Indian Mutiny were sons of country
      squires, educated in private seminaries, or by tutors on their fathers' own estates, often
      left to run wild among grooms and stableboys, and obtaining their military or colonial
      posts through purchase or influence, certainly not through examinations. And never let it
      be forgotten that the Navy, the one efficient service we possess, is officered by men who
      have not been to public schools.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is the plain truth. Our new intellectual Y.M.C.A. snobbery has sucked away our
    spinal marrow.</p>
    <p>I left my family in the hotel and went to stay with Allan, who had been advanced from a
    simple bikkhu to a sayadaw in his choung (monastery) some two miles from the city.
    Thornton's remark about the discontinuity of the ego had begun to take hold. I was anxious
    to confer with my old guru as thoroughly as possible. His view at this time was that, no
    matter how earnestly and skillfully one practised, one could not obtain Samadhi, and a
    fortiori, Arhatship, unless one's Kamma (Karma) was, so to speak, ripe. His theory was
    that one must comply with the Dhamma in all respects to give oneself a chance, but to do
    so was no guarantee of success. That depended on coincidence. His analogy was this:</p>
    <p>Suppose you are a point of a wheel and wish to touch a certain stone on the road, it is
    obviously necessary to take up your position on the rim of the</p>
    <p>{462}</p>
    <p>wheel, bet even so you may be at the top of the wheel just at the moment when the wagon
    passes over the stone.</p>
    <p>I said: &quot;How does this doctrine differ from that of shir Parananda, who said that
    Samadhi depended on 'the grace of the Lord Shiva'?&quot; He smiled grimly and said that
    Shri Parananda's doctrine was not Buddhism!</p>
    <p>In any case, I resented those views. I clung passionately to my belief that a man's
    progress depended upon personal prowess. No doubt this is philosophically absurd, but I
    still maintain that it is practical good sense. The conversation, nevertheless, turned to
    considerations of what my Kamma had in store for me. &quot;This might be discovered,&quot;
    he said, &quot;by acquiring the Magical Memory.&quot; This is equivalent to Sammasati,
    Right Recollection, the seventh step on the Noble Eightfold Path. I must explain what this
    means.</p>
    <p>The Buddhist theory of metempsychosis does not involve, like the corresponding Hindu
    idea, the survival of the individual. There is in fact no ego to survive. When a Buddhist
    says that he remembers the events of his boyhood, he does not imply that he is the boy in
    question. He is not; nor is he the man, elephant, bat, hare or what-not of &quot;his&quot;
    previous incarnation. The wave that breaks on the shore is not composed of the same
    particles of water as the &quot;same&quot; wave (as we call it) a minute earlier.
    Incarnation are successive phenomena causally connected but not identical. It would have
    been incorrect for the Buddha to say &quot;I was that holy hare&quot;. He should express
    the facts as follows: There is a consciousness of a tendency to perceive that holy hare
    and this man Gautama Buddha, as collection of impressions in which the one partially
    determines the other. This connection tends to produce the illusion of an ego whose
    experiences include the phenomena associated, then with the hare, now with the Gautama.</p>
    <p>There are two main methods of acquiring the Magical Memory as defined above. One is to
    train the normal memory to work backwards instead of forwards, so that any past action is
    presented to the mind after the manner of a cinematograph film set running in the reverse
    direction. (I never succeeded fully in acquiring the technique of this method.) The other
    is to deduce from present circumstances those which gave rise to them.</p>
    <p>Just so, one may deduce from the examination of a position on a chessboard what line of
    pay brought it about. One could not be absolutely sure; the pieces might have been set up
    by a madman; but granted that the position is intelligible, the laws of probability make
    it as certain as anything can be that it arose in a certain way. Now in considering one's
    life one has more material for investigation than a single position; one has a series of
    successive positions. Intelligent inquiry ought to be able to deduce not only the unknown
    past, but the unknown future. We have no hesitation in reconstructing the boyhood of
    Swinburne --- presuming the absence of</p>
    <p>{463}</p>
    <p>direct information -- from his works. His poetry proclaims that he studied classics
    sympathetically and profoundly, that he was influenced by pantheistic, anti-clerical and
    republican friends, and so on.</p>
    <p>Astronomers, again, observing an infinitesimally short section of the course of a
    planet or star, confidentally pronounce on its position in the past and the future, and
    even in some cases calculate its complete orbit. There is therefore nothing a priori
    absurd in trying to discover one's own nature, history and prospects, at least within very
    wide limits, from careful consideration of one's known characteristics and environment.
    &quot;Explore the rivers of the soul,&quot; says Zoroaster, &quot;whence and in what order
    thou has come.&quot; I saw that if I was to be intelligible to myself, I must do so, and
    this resolution resulted in the critical events which made the months of November,
    December, January and February the most important period of my life so far as my personal
    attitude to myself and the universe was concerned.</p>
    <p>His life as a bikkhu had not been too good for my guru. The abstinence from food after
    sunset is bad for the health, bit Allan found that after three weeks he got into the
    habit. But he was likely to be haunted by the ghost of his dead appetite. He had,
    moreover, got into a very shocking state physically from lack of proper hygiene and
    perhaps also of proper medical attention, as well as from his determination to carry out
    the strict rules of the Order. He had acquired a number of tropical complaints.</p>
    <p>I felt that my poetry had been undergoing a transition and I was not sure of my feet.
    Allen told me that he thought the most magical line in English was Coleridge's &quot;And
    ice, mast high, went floating by.&quot; The comparison is not with mountains or
    cathedrals, though they are taller than masts. The imminence of the ice is expressed by
    the phrase chosen and the reader is put upon the deck of a ship. He becomes, maugre his
    teeth one of the companions of the Ancient Mariner.</p>
    <p>This conversation led to my endeavouring to put a certain vividness of phraseology into
    my poetry. &quot;The Eyes of Pharaoh&quot; was my first attempt to give vivid and
    immediate images. I chose my similes so as to strengthen the main theme. Later in the
    month, at Mandalay, I wrote approximately half of &quot;Sir Palmede the Saracen&quot;. The
    idea of this book was to five an account of the Mystic Path in a series of episodes, and
    each episode was to constitute a definite arrangement of colour and form. Thus, Section I
    shows the blue and yellow of sea and sand, a knight in silver armour riding along their
    junction to a point where an albatross circles round a mutilated corpse.</p>
    <p>One further subject remained for discussion. I had it in my mind to put spiritual
    research on a scientific basis. The first step was to get mankind to agree on a language.
    Allan maintained that a perfectly adequate terminology existed already in the Abhidhamma,
    the metaphysical section of the Buddhist</p>
    <p>{464}</p>
    <p>canon. I could not deny the excellence of his intention, but from the point of view of
    the average Western student, the terms are so jawbreaking as to be heartbreaking. I said:
    We already possess a universal language which does not depend on grammar. The fundamentals
    of mathematics are the basis of the Holy Cabbala. It is natural and proper to represent
    the cosmos, or any part of it, or any operation of it, or the operation of any part of it,
    by the symbols of pure mathematics.</p>
    <p>On November 15th we started up the Irrawaddy by the steamship <em>Java</em> and reached
    Mandalay on the twenty-first. I spent my days and nights leaning over the rail, watching
    the wavelets of the great river and the flyingfish. I became insane. There I was, lean,
    stern, brown and immobile; and there was a set of disconnected phenomena, each with a
    sufficient reason in itself, and the whole of them uniting to produce another phenomenon;
    but there was no connection between one set of reasons and the other. Each wavelet was
    caused by certain physical conditions and the effect of the total was to slow down the
    revolution of the earth. But neither the socalled transitory, nor the so-called permanent,
    phenomenon was ultimately intelligible. Further, what I called &quot;I&quot; was simply a
    machine which recorded the impact of various phenomena.</p>
    <p>I wrote, &quot;About now I may count my speculative criticism of the reason as not only
    proved and understood, but realized.&quot; And the following day, &quot;the misery of this
    is simply sickening; --- I can write no more.&quot; The influence of the river journey
    itself had something to say to this. It is a vast implacable flood. The tangled forests on
    the banks seem like a symbol of disorder, desolation and disease. Religion itself becomes
    offensively monotonous. On every point of vantage are pagodas --- stupid stalagmites of
    stagnant piety. There is only one dagoba with any pretence to beauty. The eccentricity is
    explained thus. Even the atrophied ambition of architects had become sick of perpetual
    plagiarism. The contractor went to the queen and asked how he should build it. She
    extruded one of her breasts and said, &quot;Take that for a model.&quot; He did so, and
    the result is a refreshing relief from the routine of the regular dagoba.</p>
    <p>But the prevailing impression is one of putrefaction. Moored to the steamer were flats
    piled with fish. The sun rotted them to the point when they became unfit for food. The
    stench was incomparable; it somehow fitted with the state of my soul. At mandalay I
    exhibited this state by this entry in my diary, &quot;Saw palace and 450,001,293,847
    pagodas.&quot; The criticism is unjust: I had not counted them. There is, however, one
    good pagoda in the city, the Arrakan, and there is one really beautiful Buddha Rupa. It is
    said that this statue is the only one which is a portrait of Gautama from life. This may
    or may not by; at least it is free from the sickening conventionality of the regular
    smirking stupidity. The real glory of Mandalay consists of the</p>
    <p>{465}</p>
    <p>tables of the law. There are ten thousand slabs engraved with the canon, each under a
    canopy to protect it from the weather. I thought I had done rather well in the matter of
    book production, but I had to admit I was sitting with jack high against a royal flush.</p>
    <p>Mandalay is ghastly most of the year. It is practically under water all the summer. At
    least fifty per cent of the European residents are on the sick list and a goodly
    proportion of these die outright. There is little to choose between the Irrawaddy basin
    and the worst parts of West Africa.</p>
    <p>Yet the dwellers thereof talked as if they were in a health resort whenever the Salween
    valley was mentioned by some intrepid spirit. This was encouraging, as my main objective
    involved crossing the Salween. The map had fascinated me. The Salween, the Mekong and the
    Yangtze Kiang run parallel for a considerable distance and they are so near together that
    it only took me three days between the first two of these rivers; yet the first reaches
    the sea at Moulmein, in the Gulf of Martaban, the second below Bangkok in the Gulf of
    Siam, with the whole of the Malay peninsula between them, while the third turns suddenly
    from south to north of east and reaches the Yellow Sea thousands of miles away. The
    &quot;divides&quot; or watersheds between these three rivers during their dramatic
    parallelism must evidently be mountains of the most interesting type. I wanted to visit a
    corner of the earth which appealed thus vividly to my imagination.</p>
    <p>Incidentally, there were practical difficulties. I had at this time no notion that
    everybody was a perfect idiot. I could not understand the parochial psychology of the
    average Englishman. Even Litton, the British counsul at Tengyueh, wrote, &quot;I will say
    frankly that I had no idea that Mrs. Crowley or a child would be with you, and that while
    there is really no reason why they should not go to Yunnanfu, along the main road, they
    will, I fear, suffer a good deal of discomfort and inconvenience on the road from the
    inquisitiveness and impertinence of the Chinamen: which will try your temper. I would also
    recommend you to dress in Chinese style, and if Mrs. Crowley would not object to a Chinese
    lady's upper garment or jacket, she would attract much less attention and be less subject
    to annoyance.&quot;</p>
    <p>I did not in the least understand that the average Englishman actually resents being
    asked to sleep in a bedroom which has not been furnished in the Tottenham Court Road, and
    has not not and cold water laid on. I did not understand that his fears invariably cause
    him to interpret the natural curiosity of villagers who have never seen Europeans in their
    lives, as insolence and hostility. I did not understand that he regarded it incumbent on
    him to instruct the population who have been highly civilized for thousands of years in
    the rudiments of politeness and morality, to say nothing of religion. I knew, as I know
    that two and two make four, that it is only necessary to behave like a gentleman in order
    to calm the apprehensions</p>
    <p>{466}</p>
    <p>of the aborigines and to appeal to the fundamental fact that all men are brothers. By
    this I do not mean anything stupid, sodden and sentimental; I mean that all men equally
    require food, clothing and shelter, in the first place; and in the second, security from
    aggression in respect of life and property.</p>
    <p>Litton himself understood and appreciated the Chinese character perfectly. Though he
    was only the counsul of the most remote town of the most remote province of the most
    remote empire on earth, he ruled that whole province by the sheer strength of the
    superiority conferred by sympathy, integrity and moral courage. But his experience had not
    led him to expect that any other Englishman's character could coincide with his own at all
    these critical points.</p>
    <p>The irritability and insularity of the Englishman, with his snobbishness, pomposity and
    cant, had established a prejudice on the part of the authorities against allowing
    Englishmen to visit the interior of China. My countrymen could be relied upon to make
    mischief out of the most unpromising materials. Therefore, while the government of France
    encouraged its citizens to explore the province, Whitehall made it as difficult as
    possible for Britons. I got my permission only after senseless delay and encompassed by
    ridiculous restrictions.</p>
    <p>On November 23rd I went on board the <em>Irrawaddy</em> for Bhamo, but for one cause or
    another she did not leave Mandalay till the twenty-ninth. There are two defiles to be
    passed. The river is constructed by outcrops of rock so as to form rapids so dangerous as
    to be navigable only with extreme caution. I reached Bhamo on December 1st.</p>
    <p>The Irrawaddy is the scene of one of the most exciting commercial gambles of the world.
    At the head of the waters are mines of jade, and huge blocks of the crude mineral are
    shipped on rafts to merchants lower down. These blocks are bought by auction. It may
    almost be said that the purchaser relies on his clairvoyance, for there is no scientific
    means of determining what will happen when the block is split. The purchaser proceeds to
    split it and takes his loss or profit accordingly. The process is then repeated as the
    jade goes down the river. By the time it reaches Rangoon, it has been cut up into small
    sections an its ultimate value is approximately determined. During its transit fortunes
    have been made or lost.</p>
    <p>Though the upper river passes through hilly country, it still signals its sinister
    message of decay and death. A dramatic incident had stamped the fact on my memory. On the
    steamer was an old man, a distinguished official who had intended to retire from the
    service and take his pension a month or two before. He had been personally requested by
    the lieutenant governor to postpone his return to England that he might facilitate the
    arrangements for the visit of the Prince of Wales. The conversation of Europeans in these
    parts</p>
    <p>{467}</p>
    <p>of the earth is inexpressibly morbid; they seem obsessed by the ever present
    probability of death. The official tried to conceal his panic by loudly asserting a
    medical theory of his own, that plague, cholera, dysentery and typhoid (the four princes
    of the blood royal in the palace of King Death) were merely varieties of malarial fever. I
    said scornfully, &quot;Next time you get cholera, I hope they'll give you quinine.&quot;
    The joke came three days later, when he died of cholera. I do not know whether they gave
    him quinine or not.</p>
    <p>Bhamo is a delightful outpost. One is outside the malarial stewing of the jungle. But I
    got to hate it, as I wanted to proceed to China, and was held up for seventeen days by the
    non-arrival of my passport. The delay was partly deliberate. The deputy commissioner was
    absent; and his assistant was an Eurasian, who took the greatest delight in annoying the
    white man. I ultimately got leave to proceed over his head, and having done so rubbed it
    in with the following letter:</p>
    <p>16.12.05 <em>Dak Bungalow, Bhamo</em><br>
    Dear Sir,<br>
    In response to your thoughtful suggestion (conveyed in your favour of yesterday's date), I
    did myself the honour of presuming to enter into telegraphic communication with H.B.M.
    Consul at Tengyueh. I will being to your notice, with your kind permission, my intention
    to leave Bhamo tomorrow in consequence o the information thus conveyed; but I will refrain
    from agitating you with other portions of his communication.</p>
    <p>These, though, I suspect, will sooner or later be brought before you by His Honour the
    Lieutenant governor of Burma; and I trust that you will extend to this gentleman's
    observations the same prompt courtesy and intelligent attention which you have hitherto
    been graciously pleased to condescend to bestow upon mine.</p>
    <p>I must overwhelm myself in due expressions of gratitude for the untiring pains you have
    so willing given yourself on my behalf, and trust that efforts so unintermitted have had
    no prejudicial effect upon your constitution.</p>
    <p>I am sure that you have thoroughly enjoyed yourself, virtue being its own reward, and I
    am sure I can express no more welcome good wish than that fate may soon send you another
    real white man to treat you as you have treated me.</p>
    <p>I have the honour to be, Dear Sir,<br>
    Saint E. A. Crowley<br>
    The Assistant Commissioner, Bhamo</p>
    <p>I am not a snob or a puritan, but Eurasians do get on my nerves. I do not</p>
    <p>{468}</p>
    <p>believe that their universally admitted baseness is due to a mixture of blood or the
    presumable peculiarity of their parents; but that they are forced into vileness by the
    attitude of both their white and coloured neighbours. A similar case is presented by the
    Jew, who really does only too often possess the bad qualities for which he is disliked;
    but they are not proper to his race. No people can show finer specimens of humanity. The
    Hebrew poets and prophets are sublime. The Jewish soldier is courageous, the Jewish rich
    man generous. The race possesses imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity in an
    exceptional degree.</p>
    <p>But the Jew has been persecuted so relentlessly that his survival has depended on the
    development of his worst qualities; avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest.
    Even the highest-class Eurasians such as Ananda Koomaraswamy suffer acutely from the shame
    of being considered outcast. The irrationality and injustice of their neighbours heightens
    the feeling and it breeds the very abominations which the snobbish inhumanity of their
    fellow-men expects of them.</p>
    <p>With the departure from Bhamo may be said to begin a new phase of my career. Up to this
    point, I have been able to interweave the strands of my three lives; the lives of the
    soul, the mind and the body; or, more accurately, in the language of the Cabbala, the
    Neschamah, the Ruach and the Nephesch. The Hebrew sages have made an admirably simple,
    significant and accurate classification.</p>
    <p>The Neschamah is that aspiration which in most men is no more than a void and voiceless
    longing. It become articulate only when it compels the Ruach to interpret it. The
    Nephesch, or animal soul, is not the body itself; the body is excremental, of the Qliphoth
    or shells. The Nephesch is that coherent brute which animates it, from the reflexes to the
    highest forms of conscious activity. These again are only cognizable when they translate
    themselves to the Ruach.</p>
    <p>The Ruach lastly is the machine of the mind converging on a central consciousness,
    which appears to be the ego. The true ego is, however, above Neschamah, whose occasional
    messages to the Ruach warn the human ego of the existence of his superior. Such
    communications maybe welcomed or resented, encouraged or stifled. Initiation consists in
    identifying the human self with the divine, and the man who does not strain constantly to
    this end is simply a brute made wretched and ashamed by the fact of selfconsciousness.</p>
    <p>I find by experience that this theory represents the facts very closely. I thought it
    necessary to give at least the bare skeleton, because the next months of our story compel
    me. It is no longer possible to interweave my three lives. My ordinary career becomes a
    welter of strange adventures, some of the most uncanny kind; yet the spiritual life is
    all-important and</p>
    <p>{469}</p>
    <p>absolutely simple. The one is linked to the other only by the fact that my adventures
    appear as if they were so many obstacles deliberately put in the way of my performing the
    Operation of the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin the Mage. I shall deal first with the life of
    the senses.</p>
