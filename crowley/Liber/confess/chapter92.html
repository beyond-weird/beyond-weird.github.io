    <p>For some time past the City of London had amused itself by wondering mildly what could
    have happened to a dear old friend of theirs named Bevan. He was the head of several
    important concerns which, in fact, felt such dependence upon his gracious and intelligent
    guidance that they could hardly get on without him, especially as he had absent-mindedly
    packed in his portmanteau all their available assets. His absence aroused such anxiety and
    his speedy return was so desirable, that his friends had succeeded in interesting even
    Scotland Yard in the matter. Sympathetic friends all over Europe joined the rescue party
    and the <em>Daily Mail</em> lent its aid by publishing a photograph of the missing
    millionaire every day, week after week, and offered a prize of twenty-five thousand francs
    for information calculated to reassure the bereaved ones.</p>
    <p>Excuse the digression. Both I and the Ape of Thoth strolled across the station to the
    Hotel Christol é Christol, proposing to dine and sleep, and go on to Hardelot in the
    morning. Tired by the journey we lay down for an hour and then came down to dinner. The
    restaurant opens out of the hall; to reach it from the staircase one inclines to the
    right. I was slightly surprised to find the whole staff of the hotel, from the manager to
    the porter, drawn up in a line between me and both the entrance and the restaurant. They
    all smiled and bowed obsequiously and awkwardly, like so many marionettes.</p>
    <p>The manager stepped forward, louted him low, and motioned me towards a passage leading
    to the left. I supposed that, it being out of the season, the regular restaurant was shut
    and meals served elsewhere. He bowed me into a sort of smoking-room and suddenly shut the
    door behind me. I found myself, with no little surprise, in the presence of six men,
    dressed in black sprinkled about the room. Only one was seated; and he jumped up and asked
    my my name. I told him. He asked for my papers. By the merest chance I had left my
    passport, which I usually carry with me, in the bedroom. I told him I would go and get it.
    Two men sprang to the door. My inquisitive friend snapped out, &quot;<em>Apportez-moi le
    bagage!</em>&quot; which a couple of his satellites proceeded to do.</p>
    <p>I was, by this time, completely bewildered, but he motioned me to a chair and sat down,
    asking various questions, especially about the Ape of Thoth. Had she come from London, and
    why, and so on, which only served to increase my wonder as to what it could all be about.
    From time to time he consulted a large thin sheet of paper as if to guide him in his
    queries. The</p>
    <p>{886}</p>
    <p>light fell on it and all of a sudden I saw from the back that its centre was occupied
    by a photograph which I instantly recognized.</p>
    <p>&quot;<em>Mais, Monsieur</em>,&quot; I said, breaking into laughter, &quot;<em>vous
    n'imaginez pas que je suis pour quelque chose dans cette affaire de M. Bevan</em>.&quot;
    He retorted instantly, &quot;<em>Mais vous êtes M. Bevan!</em>&quot; I behaved very
    badly, I roared with laughter. Of course he was not put off by any such crude camouflage.
    &quot;But this is absurd,&quot; I said, &quot;I am perfectly well known as a poet and
    explorer. I don't know the difference between a joint stock company and a debenture.&quot;
    By this time my baggage had been brought. I found my passport which was, of course, in
    perfect order, but as evidence of identity produced no more effect on his mind that the
    initials of a shirt; we argued the matter for nearly an hour. One of his myrmidons after
    another stood at my side to be scrutinized for comparative height and width. One man
    thought my nose good enough to arrest me; another urged that my mouth cleared me of the
    crime. But the chief of police was tenacious. He had in his mind his step and the Legion
    of Honour and the &quot;Daily Mail's&quot; twenty-five thosand francs. Almost in despair I
    pulled out Guillamod's account of the 1902 expedition and showed him my photograph with my
    name printed under it. &quot;Do you really wish&quot;, I said, &quot;to maintain that I am
    a defaulting director?&quot;</p>
    <p>I don't know why, but this piece of evidence convinced him that I was not his man. He
    changed his tone, his men filed out, he bowed and apologized. I did not mean to be cruel,
    as no doubt I was. I told him that no excuse was necessary. I had not enjoyed myself so
    much in five years. What could a man want more --- official reception, and the rest? It
    was a bitter pill for him but it still is sweet in my mouth. One serious reflection only
    mars the music. Suppose I had happened to be an unknown man, unarmed with every possible
    proof, I might quite well have been a week or more in jail before establishing my
    identity.</p>
    <p>I must not leave this subject without a few remarks on the tendency in recent years of
    the police to attempt to arrogate themselves a function of authority altogether beyond a
    theoretical limit. Even in England, in 1922, there were several cases in which magistrates
    had to rebuke the police for encroaching upon judicial functions. In the United States, of
    course, conditions are outrageous. The extreme case is that of Becker. But apart
    altogether from individual iniquity the police claim that they cannot control crime unless
    they are empowered to make an inquisition into every man's private affairs. They take
    every opportunity of exceeding their powers of bluffing and badgering anybody that seems
    to them objectionable in total absence of any evidence whatever to establish so much as a <em>prima
    facie</em> case against them. In England so far we have not reached the stage of regular
    frame-ups with deliberate perjury, but there are suspicious signs of movement in that
    direction.</p>
    <p>{887}</p>
    <p>Let me quote from my own experience. As early as 1907, I was warned by a friend, I
    cannot say with what truth, that the police were watching me. My conscience being clear, I
    replied, &quot;Good, I shan't be burgled.&quot; In 1910 during &quot;The Rites of
    Eleusis&quot; in Caxton Hall, to which we purposely invited a police representative, they
    had other men in plain clothing outside the building, apparently hoping that something
    indictable would ooze through the brickwork.</p>
    <p>In 1913-14 again, my studio near Onslow Square was a regular rendezvous for spies. I
    was always seeing them in the courtyard, skulking behind trees as I went to and fro from
    dinner. What they had hoped to find out I cannot imagine.</p>
    <p>In Detroit, months after my return to Europe, they repeatedly raided poor half-crazed
    Ryerson's house in search of some evidence of the &quot;Devil Worshipper's Mystic Love
    Cult&quot; and of course found nothing; from which they concluded not my innocence, but
    that my pact with the devil contained a clause guaranteeing me against the discovery of my
    crimes. If any of those obstinate asses had possessed sufficient intelligence to study a
    single page of my writings, he would have seen at once what ridiculous rubbish were the
    accusations made against me by foul-minded and illiterate cheats whom I had never so much
    as met.</p>
    <p>While I was in America, the London police not only disgraced themselves by the brutal
    raid on poor old Mrs Davies, described in &quot;The Law Straw&quot;, but covered
    themselves with shame and ridicule by sending to prison a poor little bookseller who had
    sold for many years <em>The Open Court</em>, a well-known philosophical magazine of the
    highest character.</p>
    <p>Again they sent round a man to Frank Hollings to frighten him out of selling <em>The
    Equinox</em>, though no complaint had ever been made about it. Even my personal friends
    were haunted by sinister spies who made mysterious inquiries and uttered oracular hints
    about the frightful things that might happen if they happened. They wrote to my lawyers,
    and called on them to inquire my address which they knew perfectly well, and on my
    complaining to them about the theft of some of my property, not only refused to take up
    the matter, but answered me through the local police of the place where I lived, saying
    that I was &quot;well-known&quot; in Scotland Yard. The fact is undeniable, but the
    insinuation cowardly and dirty.</p>
    <p>The latest news from the front is that the special commissary in Tunis, having asked me
    to call with regard to an irregularity in my <em>permis de séjour</em>, amplified his
    remark with the cock-and-bull story intended to persuade me that I ran the risk of
    assassination by ferocious Fascisti. I asked the British consul to make inquiries and as
    with Hamlet --- the rest is silence.</p>
    <p>What interests me is the perverse psychology in this case. What can be their object? I
    am not annoyed but amused. But why should they waste so</p>
    <p>{888}</p>
    <p>much energy and public money on watching a man year after year when one would have
    thought that the most elementary common sense would have told them anyhow, after the first
    few months, that I was no more likely to infringe the law than the Archbishop of
    Canterbury?</p>
    <p>I vaguely assume some connection between this puerile policy of halfhearted pinpricks
    and the perennial flowering of the fantastic falsehoods about me. It suggests that I
    possess some quality which attracts the attention of the half-witted so that they cannot
    leave me alone. I have often wished to collect &quot;The Thousand and One Nights of
    Nonsense&quot;, of which I am the hero. Seabrook's serial in 1923 is absurdly incomplete.</p>
    <p>My arrest in mistake for Bevan, whom I resemble about as much and as little as I do any
    other featherless biped, is rather typical of the odd incidents that help to keep me
    young. But when people ask me to clear my character of the aspersions upon it, my mind
    runs back to that scene in the smoking-room. I say to myself, &quot;My dear man, if it
    took you an hour to prove to a perfectly sensible Frenchman so simple and clear a case
    with all the trumps in your fist, how long would it take to persuade a prejudiced ignorant
    public, congenitally incapable of understanding your point of view, that you are innocent
    of crimes, the witnesses to which are unavailable, and whose very nature translates the
    court into a wonderland far more weird than anything in the adventures of Alice?&quot;</p>
    <p>My second stay in Paris was short. Everything pointed to my trying my luck in London.
    One of the most amusing results of the wholesale robbery of my money and effects was that
    I had no single suit of clothes fit to wear in London. I had worn out what I had taken
    with me to America and had never had enough spare cash to replenish my wardrobe.</p>
    <p>All the clothes I had left in London had been stolen with this exception; that in the
    summer of 1914 I had sent my Highland dress to Scott Eadie to be overhauled. I now
    recalled this fact and wrote to them to send it to Paris. I had three kilts, a dress tunic
    and waistcoat, a tweed coat and vest and a green military tunic. <em>Faute de mieux</em>,
    I donned the garb of old Gaul which, if unusual, was dignified, and scrapping together
    very nearly ten pounds, I crossed the Channel in the first week of May.</p>
    <p>The first problem was to find rooms. I was taking tea with my old friend Gwendolen
    Otter and asked if anyone knew a suitable place. The vague reply was that there were
    plenty round the King's Road, Chelsea. I went off, weary in body and spirit. I could
    hardly drag one foot after the other. I had alighted at a horrible hotel in Russell Square
    thronged with hustling hooligans of the middle classes. My heart sank at the thought of
    going back there. I wanted to save the fivepenny bus fare. I came to the corner of
    Wellington Square and was suddenly seized with a direct inspiration to try my luck.
    &quot;Try the sacred numbers, especially the Secret Key of <em>The Book of the Law</em>
    --- 31!&quot;</p>
    <p>{889}</p>
    <p>Fagged as I was, I obeyed. The first number connected with my work was this very
    &quot;31&quot; and in the window was a card &quot;Apartments to Let&quot;. A van stood at
    the door, which was open. I went in. The landlady showed me a large front room on the
    first floor, with French windows opening upon a balcony which overlooked the
    spirit-soothing oasis of the square; the small green oblong with its ancient trees. It was
    clean and comfortable, the rent reasonable, and the people of the house sympathetic and
    intelligent. The bow drawn at venture had hit the ideal at the first twang of the string.
    The miracle was the more striking that the card had not been in the window till a few
    hours before; they had in fact not finished moving in.</p>
    <p>I must flit back to Paris for a moment to mention that before starting I had asked the <em>Yi</em>
    for a general symbol of my visit to London. I had obtained the hexagram &quot;Shih
    Ho&quot;, whose indications I may thus summarize. General Comment: It will be advantageous
    to use legal constraints.</p>
    <p>I took this to mean that my proper course to restore my stolen property was to take
    legal action. The special comment on each of the six lines indicates the successive events
    of the period covered by the question. My campaign would clearly end disastrously through
    the enmity of others. I resolved not to be deterred by this forecast, since the previous
    lines absolved me from blame. I should make no error. &quot;Hew to the line, let the chips
    fall where they may!&quot;</p>
    <p>In a second hexagram, asking for advice how to conduct myself, I received one emphatic
    warning: avoid getting mixed up with unworthy people.</p>
    <p>I now propose to narrate the principal events of my sojourn in England and show how
    exactly they confirmed the <em>Yi King</em>.</p>
    <p>My first objective was obviously to obtain possession of my published works which had
    been warehoused with the Chiswick Press. This press, under the auspices of Mr Charles T.
    Jacobi, had no rival, except Constable's, for excellence of printing. I had entrusted them
    with the production of the majority of my books. When I left England in 1914, I owed them
    some three hundred and fifty pounds; their security was the stock of the approximate value
    of twenty thousand pounds. In 1920 Jacobi wrote to inform me the firm was changing hands,
    and although he would remain as a director of the new company, it was essential that I
    square the account. I therefore sent them three hundred and fifty pounds. They had
    authority from me to sell any copies which might be asked for.</p>
    <p>On my arrival in London the position was that after paying warehouse charges to date,
    they owed me a little over ten pounds. They had written several times to urge me to remove
    the stock, alleging lack of space in their warehouse. I called and renewed my friendly
    acquaintance with Jacobi who agreed to hold the books till the end of May, to give me time
    to arrange for their removal. He furnished me with a complete set of the books as samples.</p>
    <p>{890}</p>
    <p>I had approached Heinemann's with a scheme to dispose of the stock. They were to
    publish every month for a year a small volume of selections, lyrics, religious verses,
    essays, stories, plays, etc., with the idea that the readers would acquire the taste and
    buy the original editions. Heinemann's ultimately rejected this proposal --- very
    reluctantly, and I believe on account of the violent personal opposition of one of their
    staff, a man whom I had never met. I found a new warehouse in due course and called to
    arrange a convenient day to remove the books.</p>
    <p>To my surprise a perfect stranger came into the outer office, a weird creature of
    nightmare, long, loose-jointed, shaking and tottering with palsy, with a head grotesque
    and ghastly, rocking upon narrow sloping shoulders that seemed to shrink from its weight.
    This fantastic horror announced itself as the managing director of the new company. I
    stated my business. To my amazement, he broke out into a spate of unmeaning insults. He
    refused point-blank to deliver the books on the ground that Scotland Yard would be down on
    him if he did. I said, &quot;But this is ridiculous. What has Scotland Yard to do with the
    matter? If you really think they are concerned, ring them up at once. Ask them!&quot; He
    went off saying he would telephone, and returned in a few minutes saying that they would
    make inquiries and let him know in a few days.</p>
    <p>Of course the police had no interest in the matter at all. But this goblin still
    refused delivery. I could only suppose him a lunatic. He did not merely insult me but Mr
    Jacobi, the best of printers, by far the most eminent in England, a man who had spent his
    life in the service of the art and who had done more for it than any single man since
    Caxton.</p>
    <p>Warner, for so my lunatic called himself, spoke of Jacobi in terms that would have been
    harsh applied to a dishonest office boy. I wrote to Jacobi personally. He replied as I
    anticipated, but admitted that the control had passed from his hands. Warner flew in even
    a more furious rage than ever at my having written, and his having replied. I had known
    Jacobi since '98, and our business relationship during the twenty-five years had been
    unbroken and uniformly pleasant. I found my friends scarcely able to believe the story.
    Such conduct as Warner's was incredible. It was obvious, however, even to him that some
    settlement was necessary. We had a final interview. He resorted to all kinds of absurd
    arguments quite impertinent to the business on hand and took an attitude in flat
    contradiction to that adopted by the firm. At the last moment, he suddenly shifted his
    ground. A furtive gleam of cunning came into his eyes and he suggested that it would be
    all right if I took the books away without his official knowledge. It was the first
    sensible thing he had said. It was arranged that he should consult the directors as a
    matter of form, and then arrange an hour for the removal over the telephone as it might be
    convenient for him to be out of the way at the time. We parted on this</p>
    <p>{891}</p>
    <p>understanding. But the next morning I got a letter that everything was off.</p>
    <p>I reflected on the <em>Yi's</em> research: &quot;It will be advantageous to use legal
    constraints&quot; and went round to my lawyer. He advised me that they had no case. The
    one technical difficulty which related to some few volumes could be obviated easily
    enough. Correspondence ensued, and finally he interviewed the solicitors of the firm and
    came to a satisfactory arrangement. Warner was away on his holiday, but the business would
    go through directly he returned. Not at all! He went back on everything and defied me to
    obtain possession. And there the matter stands, as far as I know. I have never been able
    to collect sufficient funds to recover my property which constitutes my principal asset.
    If Warner is even partially sane the motive is beyond my wit to imagine. Can he possibly
    hope that I shall drop the matter, and let him get away with twenty thousand pounds of
    stolen property?</p>
    <p>To keep a straight story, I have admitted that at Warner's suggestion two roundabout
    ways were tried. I was to make a fictitious sale of the stock to another man, and he,
    having taken them away, could transfer them to me. When he called he was assailed in the
    most intemperate language and the delivery refused. The second idea was to get my tailor
    to obtain judgment against me for the few hundreds I owed him, to be executed by seizing
    the stock. But the sheriff received the same treatment as everyone else. Warner started at
    once to heap insults upon, and hurl defiance at, the representatives of the law. What
    interests me most in all this is the problem of how such a man ever does any business. In
    my own case, part of my original plan involved the placing of large orders with his firm.
    When a stranger calls to bring him gold he is thrown out. It beats me altogether.</p>
    <p>My next important business was to re-establish my connection with editors. I called on
    the <em>English Review</em>. Austin Harrison welcomed me as warmly as ever, and asked me
    to write the centenary article on Shelley and some minor work. I signed the Shelley essay
    &quot;Prometheus&quot;. I created a furore in literary London. They were stupefied. Who
    the devil could have written it? There were not three men in England anywhere near that
    class. It was the best boost the <em>English Review</em> had had since Frank Harris and I
    had left England. Mond had withdrawn his support, turning over the <em>Review</em>, lock,
    stock and barrel, gratis, on his attention being called to the fact that Harrison
    possessed a letter from Lord Roberts denouncing Mond in such terms that its publication
    would have probably been followed by the wrecking of Mond's house in Lowndes Square, and,
    as likely as not, a lynching. Sir George Lewis called at the office (Harrison boasted to
    me that Lewis never went outside his lair for anyone less than a royal duke) and concluded
    the deal on the terms stated above on Harrison's giving his word not to make public the
    letter. It went through. But when Harrison looked for the lethal letter he failed to find
    it, and believes that Mond had arranged for someone</p>
    <p>{892}</p>
    <p>to pay an unauthorized visit to his sanctum and extract it. This hypothesis involves
    the assumption that Mond harboured doubts as to the value of Harrison's word of honour,
    which is too painful to think of.</p>
    <p>Deprived of financial support, and of the guidance of Frank Harris and myself, he was
    left to plough his lonely furrow and a crooked furrow it was. The <em>English Review</em>
    lost interest for the educated classes whose taste it was designed to please. The
    circulation sagged lower every month. Its dullness became devastating. Harrison's own work
    is always amazing and sometimes first-rate. But other contributors fell off. They got
    tired of being asked to write at nominal rates, and at that to have to extract the cheque
    with a Big Bertha corkscrew. He paid me five pounds for my Shelley essay. Subsequent
    articles were even less adequately remunerated. And it was not only a task which Jove
    would have thrown up to get paid at all, but after prolonged humiliating haggling over the
    price, the ultimate cheque was more annoying than agreeable. He would argue for an hour
    that he had said pounds and not gunieas. I put up with the pest because it amused me. I
    can hardly explain why I enjoy watching such contemptible wrigglings. I suppose it is the
    same sort of fascination as makes one stop to watch a street squabble between two
    prostitutes.</p>
    <p>A further unpleasantness was that he always wanted to mutilate what I wrote by removing
    the strongest passages or reshaping them so that my style was spoilt entirely and diluted
    with his journalistic commonplaces and clich&#130;s. I made the best of a bad job. My
    reply to Rabbi Joel Blau, &quot;The Jewish Problem Re-Stated&quot;, for example, seemed to
    me so important that any sacrifice was worth making. I doubt my wisdom. His emendations
    reduced a masterpiece of reasoning and eloquence to a comparatively unremarkable pleading,
    and it fell almost flat.</p>
    <p>My real plan was to put persistent pressure upon Harrison. I thought that in time my
    moral superiority and intelligence would convert him to a course by adopting which
    thoroughly and enthusiastically, the stone might be rolled away from the sephlchre, and
    the <em>English Review</em> regain its preeminence as the only organ in England with a
    soul of its own. In fact, so long as I stayed in London I made a good deal of headway. But
    the moment the cat was away, the mice began to play. I ran over to France for a fortnight
    in August, and when I got back he had broken his word on every point. My return restored
    order, but on leaving for Sicily, it was the same story. He had promised to publish
    something of mine every month and send me not less than eight pounds every time the first
    came round. He did not even send me the ten pounds he had promised when we parted, knowing
    well that I counted on him for this to stand between me and actual starvation.</p>
    <p>I could have born with his treatment of myself, but he used me to injure</p>
    <p>{893}</p>
    <p>others. In our early conversations he had argued with perfect justice that the English
    market for the <em>English Review</em> was hopeless, at least for a long time, and that
    therefore the only chance of restoring solvency was to push it in America. It was obvious
    that I could do this with success. He agreed to my plan, and I wrote accordingly to
    several of my friends, first-class writers, far better than any in England --- bar Conrad
    and Hardy --- asking them to contribute. They one and all wrote charmingly and
    enthusiastically, and sent a number of admirable stories. They further promised to use
    their influence --- in two cases enormous --- they being editors of periodicals whose
    combined circulation must be in the millions, to introduce the <em>English Review</em> to
    the American public. The scheme prospered beyond my greatest expectation. H. L. Mencken
    himself came to see us, and he formulated a plan of action which would have certainly
    succeeded and put Harrison's circulation up to thirty thousand at the lowest estimate
    within a few months.</p>
    <p>But this was not all. Hearing that my friend Otto Kahn, the famous financier and the
    admirably judicious appreciator of fine creative work, was in England, I asked him to
    lunch with me to meet Harrison. His agenda was full, but he proposed to call at the
    office. We talked matters over some two hours, and laid down the outlines of a scheme, the
    success of which was that a chronic invalid magazine called the <em>Forum</em> should be
    bought and amalgamated with the <em>English Review</em>. We were to publish two editions,
    I to be in charge of the <em>English Review</em> in New York. The bulk of the contents was
    to be identical, but a proportion to cover matters of local interest in the respective
    countries. Otto Kahn, while not pledging himself definitely to finance the proposal, gave
    us to understand that he would not be unwilling to support it.</p>
    <p>The sequel is really too stupid. We discussed the details of the scheme and wrote to Mr
    Kahn accordingly. But when Harrison showed me the draft of his letter I could hardly
    believe my eyes. He wanted six thousand pounds for the paper which everyone knew was being
    literally hawked about London on the chance of finding a fool to pay two thirds that
    amount, and besides he to be guaranteed two thousand pounds a year for three years. And on
    top of all he was to have an interest in the company. I didn't tell him that Otto Kahn was
    not in the market to buy gold bricks and that nothing would disgust him so thoroughly as
    so obvious an attempt to pull his leg. I knew that moderation and --- well, hang it,
    common honesty would determine Kahn to do his utmost for us. To him twelve thousand pounds
    is of course a microscopic object, but he would resent any attempt to take advantage of
    that fact as strongly and rightly as a diner in a Soho gargote objects to mistakes in his
    bill. I was furious at the abuse of my introduction, but I kept my temper, put things as
    pleasantly as I could, and begged Harrison to moderate his grab. His conscience convicted
    him. He put up the feeblest arguments I ever</p>
    <p>{894}</p>
    <p>heard in my life about the great value of the property which he constantly declared a
    thankless burden and a financial loss. I knew it was hopeless, and of course Kahn wrote
    back briefly that he had inquired and found that the <em>Forum</em> was not for sale. We
    had discussed that point. It made little difference, but it saved Kahn from having to say
    what he thought about the try on.</p>
    <p>Having enthusiastically accepted my plan about pushing the paper in America by
    publishing the work of their best men and a series of essays by myself to introduce them
    to English readers, a line of attack quite independent of the more wide-read big proposal,
    he suddenly broke away. &quot;What would happen to the English market?&quot; he wailed.
    &quot;What do they care about American writers?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;My dear man,&quot; I replied, &quot;the whole point of the game is that you have
    told me again and again that the English market is hopeless. Whatever you do you cannot
    win out in England. And even if the American campaign does diminish your sale by a few
    hundred copies, what's that as against the splendid chance of building up a circulation in
    the States?&quot; But he wouldn't see it. He dropped the whole thing.</p>
    <p>I made one other suggestion --- to try to get readers among occult students. I arranged
    a scheme of co-operation with the <em>Occult Review</em>. Ralph Shirley was enthusiastic
    and willing to help in every possible way. But Harrison never liked the scheme. His
    ignorance of the importance of the occult public was not merely complete, but invulnerable
    to all information. I gave him the figures. I proved that for one person who cared for
    poetry, there were at least a thousand whose only form of reading was spiritualism,
    theosophy, psychical research, Magick, Yoga, mysticism, Christian Science, and its
    congeners, occult freemasonry, etc., etc., <em>ad libitum</em>. He flatly refused to admit
    the facts. I begged him to try it out, if only by asking a few dozen strangers what they
    themselves cared to read. His very secretaries rose up against him and confirmed my
    statement. It was useless. His own objection to the occult was so strong, that he
    deliberately shut his eyes to the facts; even the vogue of Conan Doyle's senile dementia
    did not move him. And that is the end of that.</p>
    <p>I have not seen the <em>English Review</em> this year. I can only suppose that it has
    dropped back after the spurt of last summer into its regular ditch-water dullness, if
    indeed it has not passed away altogether by that kind of passing away which leaves nothing
    whatever behind.</p>
    <p>My third string was to publish new books. Sullivan had suggested my trying Grant
    Richards, firstly with a plan for marketing the existing stock, and secondly with a
    proposal to write my memoirs. He promised to put in a good word for me as he knew Grant
    Richards well and was influential as being a man of sound business and literary judgment.
    I therefore called</p>
    <p>{895}</p>
    <p>and made my proposals. But after some consideration, Grant Richards could not see his
    way to accept my terms. I think we were both reluctant to part; and one night I was
    inspired to try him with a third artificial minnow. I would write a shocker on the subject
    which was catering to the hysteria and pururience of the sex-crazed public: the drug
    traffic insanity. It provided a much needed variation from the &quot;white slave&quot;
    traffic. I proposed as a title <em>The Diary of a Drug Fiend</em> and sketched out a
    synopsis of its contents on a sheet of notepaper. This was mostly bluff. I had not really
    any clear idea of my story. I took this round to Grant Richards, who said it was not in
    his line. I asked him to suggest a likely firm. He said Hutchinson or Collins. Neither
    name meant anything to me. I gave Collins the first chance simply because he was on my way
    home.</p>
    <p>Invited to interview the responsible man, I found myself wondering who he was --- I had
    surely met him before. He shared my feeling and was the first to discover the source. Over
    fifteen years earlier he had been on the staff of a paper called <em>What's On</em>
    belonging to my old acquaintance Robert Haslam and at one time edited by poor crazy
    Dartnell.</p>
    <p>The gods had certainly started a new drama. The accident of this man, J. D. Beresford
    his name is, being the literary advisor of Collins probably made all the difference to the
    fate of the book. The synopsis was accepted enthusiastically and I obtained the pledges of
    money and advances, as per the &quot;Yi&quot; forecast, to the extend of a sixty-pound
    advance and a contract on much better terms than a new author could have hoped.</p>
    <p>I contracted to deliver the manuscript within a month. My idea was to rush the book
    through as a suitable for holiday reading. I wired to Paris for the Ape, who hurried over.
    We sat down at once to work. She takes my dictation in long hand, and it was therefore
    some &quot;stunt&quot; to have written the 121,000 words in 27 days, 12 3/4 hours. Mrs
    Marshall, the best typist I ever employed --- she had worked for me off and on since '98
    --- could hardly believe her eyes as one stack of manuscript came tumbling on the top of
    another. It gave me a chance to boost the Law of Thelema. I was able to show how the
    application of the principles increases efficiency as the profane deem impossible.</p>
    <p>Beresford was delighted with the manuscript and in high hopes of making a big hit.
    Unfortunately, my plan for publishing the book in August was not adopted. For various
    reasons they kept it hanging about till November. This annoyed me greatly. I expected its
    publication to arouse a tempest in the teapot around which the old women of criticism nod
    and talk scandal. I wanted to be on the spot when the fur began to fly, so as to give as
    good as I got. However, the gods have their own ideas.</p>
    <p>I now put forward my scheme for publishing my memoirs --- my autohagiography I
    playfully called it --- before Collins. Beresford knew Sullivan</p>
    <p>{896}</p>
    <p>well, another lucky coincidence; and when I sent him a fairly full synopsis, they
    accepted my proposals gladly. I took a short holiday in Paris, chiefly to give the Ape a
    good time at the seaside, and on my return settled down to dictation.</p>
