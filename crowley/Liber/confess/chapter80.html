    <p>I was back in New York on September 9th and started at once to make arrangements to
    publish volume III of <em>The Equinox</em>. (I should explain that volume II consists of
    ten numbers of silence to balance those of speech.) I found a studio at 1 University
    Place, at the corner of Washington Square. Having only one room I thought I would
    camouflage the bed and had a large screen with three sections made for me. I covered the
    canvases with a triptych, my first attempt at painting in oil. The design was symbolic of
    the three principles, Sun, Moon and Agni (fire), of the Hindus. The bed being still
    visible from some parts of the room, I got a second screen of the same pattern, which
    brought me to fame. For some days it stood patiently pleading to be painted, but I could
    not think of a subject.</p>
    <p>Early in January, I received a visit from the lady hereafter called the Ape of Thoth
    and her elder sister. The chain of circumstances antecedent is strangely tenuous.</p>
    <p>I had brought a letter of introduction, from England, to Hereward Carrington from my
    friend the Hon. Everard Feilding. Through Carrington, it came about that I was asked to
    lecture under the auspices of a particularly transparent charlatan named Christiansen, who
    worked the sealed letter swindle with a crudity that paid a very poor compliment to his
    audience. Among my hearers was only one bearing even a remote resemblance to the human
    species, an old lady painted to resemble the cover of a popular magazine. I went to talk
    to her after the lecture and found she was an intimate friend of dear Hereward's. I saw no
    more of her except by accident for a few minutes' chat on two or three occasions.</p>
    <p>One evening in the spring of 1918, I was surprised by her calling with her youngest
    sister. I could not ask them into the studio, being engaged in an important conference
    with an antique, but sprightly German lady who boasted of having introduced cabarets into
    America, and had abandoned worldly pleasures for spiritual joys. She had been entangled in
    the toils of one of the charlatans who worked the Rosicrucian racket, merrily disdainful
    of criticism based on his elementary blunders in Latin and his total ignorance of the
    history of the Order which he claimed to rule. The old lady was simple-minded, sincere and
    earnest. I did not grudge the labour of trying to get her to use common sense, but as
    almost invariable in America, and heartbreakingly common even in Europe, the task was
    beyond my powers.</p>
    <p>{791}</p>
    <p>Just as extreme hunger makes a man shovel down anything that looks like food, so the
    ache of the soul for truth makes it swallow whatever promises. The poor old woman was so
    pathetically eager to find a Master, that she would not banish the phantasm. I proved in a
    dozen different ways that the man was a foul liar. That was easy enough. His claims were
    grotesquely absurd. For instance, he said that I don't know how many knights of England
    and France --- the most improbable people --- were Rosicrucians. He said the Order was
    founded by one of the early Egyptian kings and professed to have documentary evidence of
    an unbroken hierarchy of initiates since then. He called the Order Rosae Crucis and
    translated it Rosy Cross. He said that in Toulouse the Order possessed a vast temple with
    fabulous magnificent appointments, an assertion disprovable merely by consulting Baedeker.
    He said that Rockefeller had given him nine hundred thousand dollars and at the same time
    sent round the hat with an eloquent plea for the smallest contributions. He professed to
    be a learned Egyptologist and classical scholar on terms of intimacy with the most exalted
    personages. Yet, as in the case of Peter, his speech betrayed him. He was a good chap at
    heart, a genuine lover of truth, by no means altogether ignorant of Magick, and a great
    fool to put up all this bluff instead of relying on his really good qualities. But her
    faith in him was built on the rock of her wish that his nonsense was true, and because he
    stood between her and blank despair.</p>
    <p>To return, I went out to excuse myself to my visitors. The &quot;little sister&quot;
    reminded me of Solomon's friend, for she had no breasts. She was tall and strangely thin,
    with luminous eyes, a wedge-like face, a poignant sadness and a sublime simplicity. She
    radiated an indefinable sweetness. Without wasting time on words, I began to kiss her. It
    was sheer instinct. She shared it and equalled my ardour. We continued with occasional
    interruptions, such as politeness required, to answer her sister in the rare intervals
    when she got out of breath.</p>
    <p>They went away after a while and I saw them no more until this equally unexpected call
    in January. They wanted my advice about finding an apartment in the village (a
    geographically vague section in this part of New York is called &quot;Greenwich
    Village&quot;). She wished to be near the New York University, having begun a course of
    lectures on law, being sick of her job as a teacher in Public School No. 40, the Bronx,
    which meant telling lies to an amorphous mob of adolescent Hebrew huskies, the only
    consolation being the certainty that no one would notice the nonsense she was obliged, by
    the city, to grind out.</p>
    <p>While we talked, I took off her clothes and asked her to come and pose for me when she
    felt inclined. I proposed, half in joke, to solve her problem by taking her as a lodger.
    They drifted out and I never expected to hear any more of the matter. But on the eleventh
    of January she suddenly blew in. (She</p>
    <p>{792}</p>
    <p>swears I telephoned to ask her and perhaps I did. I have my moments of imbecile
    impulse. I undressed her again, but this time not with impunity.)</p>
    <p>To appease conscience I proceeded to make a sketch, a rough rude scrawl. I had never
    drawn from the nude before. The essential simplicity of the human body beneath its
    baffling complexities was the Sphinx itself. I threw down my pencil in disgust and
    despair. But after she had gone I could not sleep. I lay in the dark and found my thoughts
    drawn by invisible gossamer to the drawing. I picked it up and was suddenly aware that
    looked at with the figure vertical instead of horizontal, it meant something. I was seized
    with a spasm of creative energy and all night long I splashed the central canvas with
    paint. When she took the pose I had asked her, &quot;What shall I call the picture; what
    shall I paint you as?&quot; She had said, &quot;Paint me as a dead soul.&quot; My screen
    is called Dead Souls.</p>
    <p>She stood central, her head the keystone of the arch of monsters. Her face is ghastly
    green. Her fleshless body lustreless, white and grey-blue shadows beneath the ribs. On the
    left-hand panel is a kneeling Negress, bestially gross, her gaze fixed adoringly on the
    Queen of Dead Souls. Perched on her shoulder, a parrot of brilliant plumage, many hued,
    surveys the scene with insolent indifference. On the opposite canvas is a kneeling woman
    huddled as if in agony, a cascade of lustreless hair tumbling to her hips.</p>
    <p>Along the entire base are rows of misshapen heads; all anguish, all perversity, all
    banishment from the world of reasonable things is portrayed in almost endless variety. The
    screen is grotesque, yet is undeniably a work of genius. It possesses a unity. The dead
    souls have composed a living soul. Everyone who saw it went away horror-struck or in the
    spirit of Shimei. But they all talked of nothing else. Bob Chandler came again and again
    to gaze and gloat. He brought everyone he knew to look at it. And even artists famous for
    their classical refinement had to admit its grisly power. In short, the dead souls
    conquered the city and their Queen their creator. She came like Balchis to Solomon,
    bringing gifts, an endless caravan of fascinations. Innumerable elephants groaning under
    the treasury of virtues, while in her own slim-fingered hands, she brought her heart.
    Before her coming the concubines covered their faces and fled. We found almost at once a
    splendid studio on the south side of Washington Square, a long and lofty room with three
    wide windows, looking out across the tree tops to the opening of Fifth Avenue.</p>
    <p>From this point of vantage the ensuing months appeared tolerable. I was occupied in
    defeating the dishonest intrigues of the people in Detroit who had sent emissaries to
    approach me in the winter. I was persuaded to put the publication of <em>The Equinox</em>,
    vol. III, No. 1</a> into the hands of those
    latter, and they immediately began to try to evade fulfilling the terms of the contract. I
    spent the summer in a tent beyond Montauk at the extremity of Long Island.</p>
    <p>{793}</p>
    <p>The Magical Retirement made it clear that the current was exhausted. I had finished my
    work in America and began to prepare my escape.</p>
    <p>In the autumn I accepted an invitation to visit my friends William and Kate Seabrook on
    their farm in Georgia to which they had retired. He had held an important position on the
    Hearst papers, and his sanity and decency had revolted against so despicably disgusting a
    job. He knew he was a genius and the effect of knowing me was to make him ashamed of
    himself. Alas, not long after my influence was removed, he became a backslider. He made
    sporadic attempts to escape from his environment, but the caress of this world and the
    deceitfulness of riches choke the artist's word and it becomes untruthful.</p>
    <p>I passed a delightful six weeks in the south. Political and social conditions were of
    great interest. The standardized surface has overspread the south, but it has not
    completely smothered the old violence of passion and prejudice. The hatred of the Yankee
    and his fear of the Negro are as great as ever. In the latter case it has increased. The
    recent revival and the nation-wide spread of the Ku-Klux-Klan is one of the most sinister
    symptoms of recent years.</p>
    <p>From Atlanta I went to Detroit and then took in the Mammoth Caves of Kentucky. I need
    not describe them. I content myself with the remark that they make a third wonder of the
    world worth seeing, from Niagara to the Grand Canyon. Except for the Yellowstone Park,
    which I have not yet seen, nothing else in America is worth seeing first or last for the
    matter of that.</p>
    <p>A final inspection of the bughouse in Detroit left me free to get back to Europe. I
    reached London a few days before Christmas 1919.</p>
