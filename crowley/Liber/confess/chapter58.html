    <p>November 18th, 1905 was my seventh birthday in the Order, I wrote: &quot;About now I
    may count my Speculative Criticism of the Reason as not only proved and understood, but
    realized.&quot; And on the ninteenth: &quot;The misery of this is simply sickening --- I
    can write no more.&quot;</p>
    <p>I must explain. All these seven years, especially when in the East, I had discussed
    religion and philosophy with all sorts and conditions of men. Further, I had studied the
    sacred books of all religions of antiquity. My experiences all tended to the uniform
    conclusion that one could go all round the circle in any argument. Christian philosophers
    have seized on this fact to urge that our only hope of arriving at truth is through faith;
    but it is the bankruptcy of faith that originally drove us to test it by reason. I saw
    that the true solution was, on the contrary, that of the mystic. In Cabbalistic and
    scientific language, we possess a faculty of apprehension independent of reason, which
    informs us directly of the truth.</p>
    <p>I wrote in my Magical Diary on November 19th, 1905:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I realize in myself the perfect impossibility of reason; suffering great misery. I am
      as one who should have plumed himself for years upon the speed and strength of a favourite
      horse, only to find not only that its the speed and strength were illusory, but that it
      was not a real horse at all, but a clothes-horse. There being no way --- no conceivable
      way --- out of this awful trouble gives that hideous despair which is only tolerable
      because in the past it has ever been the Darkness of the Threshold. But this is far worse
      than ever before; I wish to go from A to B; and I am not only a cripple, but there is no
      such thing as space. I have to keep an appointment at midnight; and not only is my watch
      stopped, but there is no such thing as time ... But surely I am not a dead man at thirty!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From this date till the first week in February, I was intellectually insane. The actual
    ordeal is described with intense simplicity and passion in &quot;Aha!&quot; I call it
    &quot;the Order of the Veil, the Second Veil&quot; and the &quot;Veil of the Abyss&quot;.
    The complete destruction of reason left me without other means of apprehension than
    Neschamah.</p>
    <p>I have already explained briefly what are meant by Neschamah, Ruach and Nephesch. I
    must now go a little more deeply into the doctrines of the Cabbala. The human
    consciousness is represented as the centre of a hexagon</p>
    <p>{509}</p>
    <p>whose points are the various faculties of the mind; but the uppermost point, which
    should link the human consciousness with the divine, is missing. Its name is Daäth,
    Knowledge. The Babylonian legend of the &quot;fall&quot; is a parable of the shutting out
    of man from Paradise by the destruction of this Daäth and the establishment of this
    Abyss. Regeneration, redemption, atonement and similar terms mean alike the reunion of the
    human with the divine consciousness. Arrived at the highest possible point of human
    attainment by regular steps, one finds oneself on the brink of the Abyss, and to cross
    this one must abandon utterly and for ever all that one has and is. (In unscientific
    mysticism the act is represented sentimentally as the complete surrender of the self to
    God.) In unsectarian English, the act implies first of all the silencing of the human
    intellect so that one may hear the voice of the Neschamah.</p>
    <p>We may now consider further what is meant by Neschamah. It is the human faculty
    corresponding to the idea Binah. Understanding; which is that aspect of the divine
    consciousness which corresponds to the Female Idea. It receives, formulates and transmits
    the pure divine consciousness, which is represented by a triangle (for the Trinity) whose
    apex is the essence of the true self (corresponding to Brahman, Atman, Allah etc. --- not
    to Jehovah, who is the Demiurge) and whose other angle is Chiah, the Masculine aspect of
    the self, which creates. (Chiah corresponds to Chokmah: Wisdom, the Word.) This divine
    consciousness is triune. In its essence it is absolute and therefore contains all things
    in itself, but has no means of discriminating between them. It apprehends itself by
    formulating itself through the postulation of itself as male and female, active and
    passive, positive and negative, etc.</p>
    <p>The idea of separateness, of imperfection, of sorrow, is realized by it as an illusion
    created by itself for the purpose of self-expression. The method is precisely that of the
    painter who plays off one colour against another in order to represent some particular
    idea of himself which pleases him. He knows perfectly well that each colour is in itself
    imperfect, a partial presentation of the general idea of light.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Attainment of Unity&quot; would be, theoretically, to mix up all the paints
    and produce a surface without colour, form or meaning; yet those philosophers who insist
    on symbolizing God by Unity reduce Him to a nonentity. The more logical of these, indeed,
    carry their thesis a little further and describe the Deity as &quot;without quantity or
    quality&quot;. Even the Prayer Book describes Him as &quot;without body, parts or
    passion&quot;, though it continues cheerfully by describing His parts and His passions in
    detail. The Hindus actually realize that their Parabrahman thus defined, by negating all
    propositions soever about him, is not a being at all in any intelligible sense of the
    word. Their aspiration to be absorbed in his essence depends on the thesis that
    &quot;Everything is Sorrow.&quot;</p>
    <p>{510}</p>
    <p>The Buddha took the last logical step, rejected Brahman as a mere metaphysical figment
    and replaced the idea of union with him by that of absorption in Nibbana, a state of
    cessation pure and simple. This is certainly a step forward; but it still throws no light
    on the subject of how things came to be such that only cessation can relieve their
    intolerable sorrow; though it is clear enough that the nature of any separate existence
    must be imperfection. The Buddha impudently postulates &quot;Mara&quot; as the maker of
    the whole illusion, without attempting to assign a motive for his malice or a means by
    which he could gratify it. Incidentally, his &quot;existence in itself&quot; is the whole
    of the evil Mara, which is just as impertinent a postulate as any of the uncreated
    creators and uncaused causes of other religions. Buddhism does not destroy the
    philosophical dilemma. Buddha's statement that the fundamental error is ignorance is as
    arbitrary, after all, as Milton's that it was pride. Either quality implies a host of
    others, all equally inconceivable as arising in a homogeneous state either of bliss or
    nonentity.</p>
    <p>In eighty days I went round the world of thought and, like Phineas Fogg and Omar
    Khayyam, came out by the same door as in I went. The solution must be practical, not
    theoretical; real not rational. Tyndall says somewhere that it is evidently possible for
    men to acquire at any moment the use of a new faculty which would reveal a new universe,
    as completely as the development of sight has done, or as the invention of the
    spectroscope, the electroscope, etc., has done, and shown us unsuspected material
    universes. It is to be carefully observed that we unhesitatingly class as
    &quot;material&quot; all sorts of ideas which are not directly appreciable by any of our
    senses. I was in no way apostasizing from my agnosticism in looking for a universe of
    beings endowed with such qualities that earlier observers, with few facts and fewer
    methods of investigation and criticism at their disposal, called &quot;gods&quot;,
    &quot;archangels&quot;, &quot;spirits&quot; and he like.</p>
    <p>I began to remember that I was myself an initiate, that the Great Order had given me
    the Cabbala as my working hypothesis. I now found that this doctrine satisfied perfectly
    my science, my scepticism and my soul. It made no pretence to lay down the law about the
    universe. On the contrary, it declared positively the agnostic conclusion of Huxley. It
    declared reason incompetent to create a science from nothing and restricted it to its
    evident function of criticizing facts, so far as those facts were comprehensible by it.</p>
    <p>But the Cabbala did not leave me in despair; it asserted the existence of a faculty
    such as that suggested by Tyndall, by the use of which I could appreciate truth directly.
    I may here refer to the historic claim of mystics that their truth is incomprehensible to
    human reason and inexpressible in human language. The arrogance of the proposition was
    less repugnant to me than its confession of incompetence and its denial of the continuity
    of</p>
    <p>{511}</p>
    <p>nature. I have devoted countless days and nights to forcing myself to formulate the
    intuitions of trance in intelligible ideas, and conveying those ideas by means of well
    defined symbols and terms. At the period I am describing, such an effort would have been
    bricks without straw. My truly mystical experiences were extremely few. I have
    subsequently developed a complete system, based on the Cabbala, by which any expression
    may be rendered cognizable through the language of intellect, exactly as mathematicians
    have done: exactly, too, as they have been obliged to recognize the existence of a new
    logic. I found it necessary to create a new code of the laws of thought.</p>
    <p>One example pertinent to this period will illustrate the strangeness of the world
    revealed by the development of Neschamah. The human consciousness is primarily
    distinguishable from the divine by the fact of its dependence on duality. The divine
    consciousness distinguishes a peach from a pear, but is aware all the time that the
    difference is being made for its own convenience. The human accepts the difference as
    real. It also fails to accept the fact that it knows nothing of the object as it is in
    itself. It is confined to an awareness that its consciousness has been modified by its
    tendency to perceive its sensations, which it refers to its existence. One must be expert
    in Pratyahara to apprehend intuitively the data of Berkeleyian idealism. In other words,
    the condition of human consciousness is the sense of separateness; that is, of
    imperfection; that is, of sorrow.</p>
    <p>Now then for our illustration. I aspire to the good, the beautiful and the true. I
    define my Holy Guardian Angel as a being possessing these qualities in perfection and
    aspire to His Knowledge and Conversation. I propose therefore to perform the Sacred Magick
    of Abra-Melin the Mage. But what is my first postulate! That there exists a real
    difference between those qualities and their opposites, between Him and myself. It is true
    that I aim at the identification of myself with Him, but I have already defined Him as
    imperfect, maugre my gaudy phraseology, by admitting that He is separate from me. I define
    truth as imperfect by distinguishing it from untruth. (When one has crossed the Abyss,
    these considerations --- fantastic to the point of comicality as they appear on the
    surface --- become the most formidable foes in practical life. For example, one has to
    resolve the antithesis between action and inaction, and one removes one's motive with deft
    surgery by destroying the dividuality of joy and sorrow.) My aspiration in itself affirms
    the very idea which it is its sole object to deny.</p>
    <p>Thus, then, all Magick is based on the illusion inherent in the reason itself. Since
    all things soever are separate; since their separateness is the essential element of their
    existence; and since all are equally illusions, why aspire to the Holy Guardian Angel? ---
    why not to the Dweller on the Threshold? To the man who has not passed entirely through
    the Abyss thoughts of this kind are positively frightful. There is no rational answer
    possible, from the nature of</p>
    <p>{512}</p>
    <p>the case; and I was tormented indescribably by these thoughts, thousands after
    thousands, each a terrific thunderbolt blasting its way through my brain during these
    frightful months. Of course <em>The Book of the Law</em> makes mincemeat of all such
    dragons, but I am convinced that the gods deliberately kept me away from seeking the
    solution in its pages, though I was their chosen confidant. They were determined that I
    should drain the last dregs of the vitriol. (<em>Visita Interiora Terrae, Rectificado
    Invenies Occultum Lapidem</em>.)</p>
    <p>It was essential that I should learn the technique of crossing the Abyss with absolute
    thoroughness for they had it in mind to entrust me with the task of teaching others
    exactly how to do it. Thus, though I crossed the Abyss at this period, underwent one
    particular phase of the ordeal, I was restricted to that particular experience which
    sufficed for their immediate purpose in regard to me. I had to work out its problems in
    many other ways on many other occasions, as will appear from the sequel. <em>The Book of
    the Law</em> was to my hand, but the gods themselves had hardened my heart against it. I
    had hardened my own heart; I had tried to go round the Boyg. They answered, &quot;Thou
    hast said.&quot;</p>
    <p>I know now from the experience of others that <em>The Book of the Law</em> is veritably
    a Golden bough. It is the only thing that one is allowed to take with one through Hades
    and it is an absolute passport. In fact, one cannot go through Hades at all; there is no
    &quot;one&quot; to go. But the Law itself bridges the Abyss, for &quot;Love is the law,
    love under will.&quot; One's will-to-cross is to disintegrate all things soever into
    soulless dust, love is the one force which can bind them together into a coherent
    causeway. There, where torn thoughts sank through the starless space, aching and impotent,
    into what was not even nothingness, each alive for ever because reduced to its ultimate
    atoms so that there was no possibility of change, no hope of any alleviation of its
    anguish, each exquisitely mindful that its captain had slain himself in despair; there may
    men pass today in peace. What with <em>The Book of the Law</em> to guide them, and my
    experience to warn them, they can prepare themselves for the passage; and it is their own
    fault if the process of self-annihilation involves suffering.</p>
    <p>I cannot even say that I crossed the Abyss deliberately. I was hurled into it by the
    momentum of the forces which I had called up. For three years, save for spasmodic and
    half-hearted incidents, and the great moment in Cairo which took place in direct
    opposition to the united efforts of my scepticism, my cynicism, my disgust with
    everything, my idleness and my prejudices, I had been fighting against my destiny. I had
    been building up a great dam. My occasional return to Magick had been more in the nature
    of occasional sprees than anything else, as a man consumed by an over-mastering passion
    for a woman and determined to trample her under foot, might seek relief in occasional
    flirtations.</p>
    <p>{513}</p>
    <p>A magical oath is the most irresistible of all moral forces. It is an affirmation of
    the true will; that is to say, it is a link between the conscious human and the
    unconscious divine nature of the man who takes it. A magical oath which does not express
    the true will sets these forces in opposition and therefore weakens the man the more
    gravely as the oath is more seriously meant and taken. But given that the oath is a true
    expression of the true will, its effect is to affirm that very union between the
    insignificant force of the conscious being and the irresistible might of that which is
    &quot;one, eternal and individual&quot;, that which is inexpugnably immune to all forces
    soever; which when accomplished constitutes it supreme.</p>
    <p>My position was this. In 1897 I had unconsciously discovered my true will and devoted
    myself to find the means of carrying it out. In 1898 Ifound the means and had had
    concentrated all my resources of any kind onhad swept aside every making the most of it. I
    obstacle, internal andyears; the dam, my external. The reaction of 1902 had lasted just
    three carnal mind, had begun to leak; a moment later, it was swept away by theavenging
    tides; they swept away the last remnant of my reason.</p>
    <p>There is a feeble rattle of the rifles of the rearguard, some ineffectual foppishness
    about discipline between November the nineteenth and twenty-fifth, then absolute silence
    till the eighth of February, when I write, &quot;About this full moon consciousness began
    to break through Ruach into Neschamah. Intend to stick to Augoeides.&quot;</p>
    <p>I found myself in a truly surprising state.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>As I trod the trackless way<br>
          Through sunless gorges of Cathay,<br>
          I became a little child,<br>
          By nameless rivers, swirling through<br>
          Chasms, a fantastic blue,<br>
          Month by month, on barren hills,<br>
          In burning heat, in bitter chills,<br>
          Tropic forest, Tartar snow,<br>
          Smaragdine archipelago,<br>
          See me --- led by some wise hand<br>
          That I did not understand.<br>
          Morn and noon and eve and night<br>
          I, the forlorn eremite,<br>
          Called on Him with mild devotion,<br>
          As the dewdrop woos the ocean.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I had all the innocence and helplessness if a child at the period when it gropes
    instinctively for someone to love it, someone whom it knows and trusts, who is infinitely
    strong, infinitely wise and infinitely kind.</p>
    <p>{514}</p>
    <p>I am not quite sure why I chose the word &quot;Augoeides&quot; to represent my thought.
    It may well be because it was not spoilt for me by any personal association with the past.
    I have been carried away by the necessity of simplifying (to the utmost of my ability) the
    story of my passage through the Abyss. I must now explain why I issued from it with this
    particular idea of Augoeides rather than another, for every idea in my mind had been
    shattered in fragments and brayed in a mortar, reduced to impalpable dust and scattered to
    the four winds of heaven. Sir Isaac Newton to the rescue! His first law of motion is
    sufficient to make the point clear.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A body either keeps its course (or else remains at rest)<br>
        Unless by some external force its motion is impressed.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The effect of my ordeal had been to remove all forces soever which had impinged on my
    normal direction. My star had been diverted from its proper orbit by, had been held back
    by, the attraction of other heavenly bodies. Their influence had been removed. For the
    first time in my life I was really free. I had no personality left. To take a concrete
    case: I found myself in the middle of China with a wife and child. I was no longer
    influenced by love for them, no longer interested in protecting them as I had been; but
    there was a man, Aleister Crowley, husband and father, of a certain caste, of certain
    experience, of travel in remote parts of the world; and it was <em>his</em> business to
    give them his undivided love, care and protection. He could do this very much more
    efficiently than before when I was aware of what he was doing, and consequently inclined
    to overplay the part.</p>
    <p>But with regard to my magical future --- why did I &quot;intend to stick to
    Augoeides&quot;? The reason becomes clear if we consider the nature of the meditation ---
    Sammasati --- which had constituted the essence of my success in passing through the
    ordeal.</p>
    <p>I determined on this at Allan's suggestion and one of my main objects in going to stay
    with him at the choung was to do it. I thought it could be done in three days! There must
    be a lot of silly young asses knocking about the world, but I think I can give most of
    them a couple of strokes a hole.</p>
    <p>The method of the meditation is described (1911) in <em>Liber
    Thisharb</em></a>, and I have outlined it in an earlier chapter. I quote from <em>The Temple of Solomon the King</em></a> (<em>The
    Equinox</em>, vol. I, No. VIII</a>).</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>... he found his old comrade, I.A, now a member of the Buddhist Sangha, under the name
      of Bhikku Ananda Metteya.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It was from him that he received the instructions which were to help him to reach the
      great and terrible pinnacle of the mind whence the adept must plunge into the Abyss, to
      emerge naked, a babe --- the Babe of the Abyss.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{515}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Explore the River of the Soul,&quot; said Ananda
      Metteya</a>, &quot;Whence and in what order you have come.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For three days --- the longest period allowed by the Buddhist law --- he remained in
      the choung, meditating on this matter; but nothing seems to have come of it. He set his
      teeth and settled down doggedly to this consideration of the eternal why. Here is a being
      in Rangoon. Why? Because he wanted to see Bhikku A. M. Why? Because --- and so on to the
      half-forgotten past, dark seas that phosphoresced as the clean keel of his thought divided
      them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I had eliminated a vast number of possible replies to the question of Zoroaster above
    quoted by Allan. I might even have discovered my true will, as indeed the meditation
    should enable me to do, had it not been interfered with by the larger question with its
    smashing academic scepticism. The question posed by the meditation assumes a casual
    connection between events and even to some extent a purposeful connection. Now in the
    Abyss these are the very two ideas which are torn from under the bridge of continuity
    which they should support.</p>
    <p>The practical point was that I had no proof whatever that there was any purpose in my
    past life or could be in my future. I again quote from &quot;The Temple of Solomon the
    King&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Baffled again and again, the fall with his horse supplied the one factor missing in his
      calculations. He had repeatedly escaped death in matters almost miraculous. &quot;Then I
      am some use after all!&quot; was his conclusion. &quot;I am indeed SENT to do
      something.&quot; For whom? For the universe; no partial good could possibly satisfy his
      equation. I am, then, the &quot;Chosen Priest and Apostle of Infinite Space&quot;. Very
      good: and what is the message? What shall I teach men? And like lightning from heaven fell
      upon him these words: &quot;THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONVERSATION OF THE HOLY GUARDIAN
      ANGEL.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So again we read (in the diary) on February 11th: &quot;Made many resolutions of a G.
    R. (Great Retirement). In dream flew to me an angel, bearing an ankh, to comfort me.&quot;</p>
    <p>We may now transcribe the diary. We find the great mind, the complex man, purged
    through and through of thought, stripped of all things human and divine, centred upon one
    single aspiration, as simple as the love of a child for its father.</p>
    <p>Like lightning from heaven? Not lest swift flashed back the obvious question of the
    practical man, how? The answer was immediate: &quot;INVOKING OFTEN&quot;. I need not have
    asked. They were the words of Zoroaster indeed, but they were also my own. I had used them
    in my paraphrase of</p>
    <p>{516}</p>
    <p>Zoroaster in Tannh&#132;user's song. And after all, there is nothing specially magical
    about them except that they are in the plain common sense of psychology. Huxley said that
    science was organized common sense, and Frazer that science was successful Magick. The
    syllogism presents no difficulties.</p>
    <p>Only one point remained for consideration. I had said how almost insanely anxious I had
    always been about economizing time. My mind is, perhaps, the most infernally active on the
    globe. I cannot bear to eat a meal except as a deliberate debauch. I like to play a game
    of chess and read a book &quot;while fortifying my body thereby&quot; and engaging in
    conversation with the other guests. I was constantly devising dodges for making the most
    of every moment. I hate to shut a door behind me, on the ground that I might have to open
    it again. I detest changing my clothes. I keep my head shaved if there is any risk of
    being called upon to brush my hair. On the other hand, I like shaving myself because, as
    many men know, the operation tends to produce fertility of ideas.</p>
    <p>Having decided to invoke the Augoeides, how was I to do it without unnecessary delay? I
    had everything ready at Boleskine, but Chen Nan Chan is sixty li from Pa Shih Pai, and it
    was as many days from England, home and beauty, going L for leather. The operation should
    begin at Easter. It could not be done that year by ordinary means. But my Sammasati came
    to the rescue. I knew that every event in my life had been arranged by the gods to be of
    use to me in the accomplishment of the Great Work. I did not need an aeroplane: I had a
    magical carpet. I could travel in my astral body to my temple and perform the Operation,
    perhaps even more conveniently than in the flesh. <em>Per contra</em>, I could construct
    my own temple about me and perform the Operation in my physical body. For various reasons,
    I preferred the latter method.</p>
    <p>I was still entirely &quot;off&quot; <em>The Book of the Law</em>. I had with me my
    unique vellum copy of <em>The Goetia</em> and I proposed to use the Preliminary
    Invocation. I was to begin by performing this twice daily to work up a current, to acquire
    concentration, to invoke often.</p>
    <p>On February 11th I had spent the fifty li of the journey, P'u P'eng to Ying Wa Kuan, in
    making resolutions to undertake the Great Magical Retirement. That night I had a dream, in
    which an angel flew to me &quot;to comfort me&quot;. He was bearing an ankh in his hand.
    If I had known then, as I do now, that the ankh is not fundamentally a <em>crux ansata</em>
    but a sandal strap, the symbol of the power to go, I should have understood that I ought
    to make the Retirement on the journey. It is obviously weakness to rely upon one's
    material surroundings, and I was already sufficiently in the habit of performing
    meditations in the most unsatisfactory conditions to have had no hesitation. I had chosen
    to set up my first temple at one of the busiest corners of London, with the deliberate
    object of training myself not to be put off by noise.</p>
    <p>{517}</p>
    <p>The plan was not a bad one. I am quite inaccessible to disturbance except of one kind.
    The neighbourhood of anyone on whom I have bestowed the right to speak to me is a cause of
    distraction. In practice I train such people carefully not to address me when I am working
    --- aye! at any time --- without special justification. I made a further experiment in
    October 1908 (see &quot;John St. John&quot;) of carrying out a complete Magical Operation
    of the most important kind while leading the life of the normal man-about-town in the
    Montparnasse quarter. I did this to demonstrate to the people who complained that they had
    not the time or convenience for Magick, that they could do it without giving up their
    ordinary business or social life.</p>
    <p>Though I did not fully understand the implication of the dream, I managed to act as if
    I had done so. I must have had some suspicions that my old friends the Abra-Melin demons
    would go on the war path; at least I acted accordingly from the fourteenth. Finding myself
    with the glands of my throat badly swollen, and my mind distracted by worrying about them,
    I asked the Augoeides to remove my fear. This is dangerously like prayer, on the surface;
    but at least I did not ask to be cured. The request was immediately granted. I was ill for
    several days, but able to continue my invocations.</p>
    <p>My plan was to transport the astral form of my temple at Boleskine to where I was, so
    as to perform the invocation in it. It was not necessary for me to stay in one place
    during the ceremony; I frequently carried it out while riding or walking. As the work
    became familiar to me it became easier. I was able to withdraw my attention from the
    actual words and gestures, and concentrate on the intention. On the theory of Sammasati,
    every faculty must be used in the Great Work. On the surface, there seems little relation
    between Magick and chess, but my ability to play three games simultaneously blindfold was
    now very useful. I had no difficulty in visualizing the astral temple by an effort of
    will, and of course I was perfectly able to watch the results of the invocations with my
    astral eyes. During these weeks I developed the technique though not to the full extent
    described in <em>Liber Samekh</em>. A description of the method, as far as I had taken it
    at this time, is given in <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I,
    No. VIII</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The preamble: he makes a general concentration of all his magical forces and a
      declaration of his will.</p>
      <p>The Ar Thiao section. He travels to the infinite East among the hosts of angels
      summoned by the words. A sort of &quot;Rising on the Planes&quot;, but in a horizontal
      direction.</p>
      <p>The same remarks apply to the next three sections in the other quarters.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At the great invocation following he extends the Shivalingam to infinite height, each
      letter of each word representing an exaltation of it by</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{518}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>geometrical progression. Having seen this satisfactorily, he prostrates himself in
      adoration.</p>
      <p>When consciousness begins to return, he uses the final formula to raise that
      consciousness in the Shivalingam, springing to his feet at the moment of uniting himself
      with it, and lastly uttering that supreme song of the initiate beginning: &quot;I am He,
      the Bornless Spirit, having sight in the feet; strong and the Immortal Fire!&quot;</p>
      <p>(Thus performed, the invocation means about half an hour of the most intense magical
      work imaginable --- a minute of it would represent the equivalent of about twelve hours of
      Asana.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Despite the distracting influence of the varied adventures described in the last
      chapter, I stuck steadily to my practice. On leaving Hong Kong, however, being once again
      a lonely Wanderer of the Waste, I did feel freer to analyze myself. I thought the
      necessity of defining the words that I used more closely. There is an indication of this
      in my entry of April 4th:</p>
      <p>I foolishly and wickedly put off A.'.; work all day; now it is one a.m. of the fifth.
      By foolish, I mean contrary to my interest and hope in A.'..</p>
      <p>By wicked I mean contrary to my will.</p>
      <p>A.'. goodish; lengthy and reverie-like. Yet my heart is well. I spake it audibly.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Before this time I had been haunted by the first of the two terrible doubts which I
    subsequently described in sections 36 and 38 of <em>Sir
    Palamedes</em></a>, but during the abominable &quot;wind draught&quot; of the first week
    of March I had made a partial image of this doubt in the &quot;King-Ghost&quot;. I did not
    understand the essence of the doubt and it is hard to explain it in prose, even now. It
    seems at first sight to be a reflection of the all-embracing doubt of the Abyss. It
    concentrated itself into the entirely practical question: is there an Augoeides after all?
    Is there a Path of the Wise? Am I simply fooling myself? And in the &quot;King-Ghost&quot;
    my only answer is to appeal to the very power whose existence is in dispute. The extreme
    beauty of the lines, their magic melancholy and their appropriateness to the circumstances
    of my journey encourage me to quote the poem, which I do:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>The triumphant answer is simply the mystic's affirmation of interior certainty. No
    doubt this expresses my attitude at the time: I was still a little child. But as I grew,
    so did the doubt. I saw that the answer given in the &quot;King-Ghost&quot; was
    insufficient. I realized subconsciously what is the hardest thing of all for any of us to
    realize; that we are each &quot;one, eternal and individual&quot;, that there is no one on
    whom we should rely, that such doubts should be destroyed, neither by the rational method

    <p>I had been in fairly regular astral communication with Soror F., but I wanted to see
    her in the flesh and therefore called on her in Shanghai. On the sixth and seventh of
    April I explained the position to her, and went to stay with her on the ninth. The next
    twelve days we were constantly working together. The results of this work are so important
    that I must enter into them rather fully. It is significant of my eternal subconscious
    reaction against <em>The Book of the Law</em> that even when editing my diaries for
    Captain J. F. C. Fuller for &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King&quot;, I deliberately
    omitted to pay any attention to them. The reference is meagre and vainglorious, and the
    promise to deal with them elsewhere has never been kept. It is evidently a dodge for
    avoiding the responsibility.</p>
    <p>A.'. in the presence of my Soror F.</p>
    <p>(The results of this and the next invocation were most brilliant and important. They
    revealed the Brother of A.'. A.'. who communicated in Egypt as the Controller of all this
    work.)</p>
    <p>The first result of my work with Soror F. was that immediately I told her of the work
    in Cairo, she said boldly and finally that she believed in the genuineness of the
    communication. I was infuriated. I believe my main object in going to see her had been to
    get encouragement in my revolt. I had carefully avoided telling her anything about it in
    the whole course of our astral interviews; but she insisted that we should study <em>Liber
    Legis</em> together. I had my copy with me. (It is very remarkable that the gods managed
    to look after me so that I am never in lack of anything that I</p>
    <p>{521}</p>
    <p>need for the performance of any particular work. My deliberate carelessness, my
    attempts to destroy things, are always quite useless. The gods always perform the
    necessary miracle to enable me to have at hand anything that may be necessary at the
    moment.)</p>
    <p>So my diary reads on April 18th:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Studying <em>Liber Legis</em>. Decide to ask F. to invoke Aiwass and converse with Him
      when invoked, and thereby to decide on the quality of that Magick.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On the twentieth, therefore, we went into her temple:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Aiwass invoked appears, of brilliant blue as when she saw him as guardian of my sleep.
      He has followed me ever, wishing me to follow his cult. When P. took wand, he grows
      brilliant and breaks up into a formless light; yet she feels him as an enemy. He seems
      entangled in a mesh of light and to be trying to escape. I warn him that if he goes away,
      he cannot return. (F. in herself is hostile) &quot;Return to Egypt, with different
      surroundings. (This misheard: he said <em>same</em>.) There I will give thee signs. Go
      with the S. W. (Ouarda), this is essential: thus you shall get real power, that of God,
      the only one worth having. Illumination shall come by means of power, <em>pari passu</em>.
      (Evidently my own transcript of her words.) Live in Egypt as you did before. Do not do a
      G. R. Go at once to Egypt; money troubles will be settled more easily than you think now.
      I will give you no guarantee of my truth.&quot; He then turned blue-black. &quot;I am
      loath to part from you. Do not take F. I do not like the relations between you; break them
      off! If not you must follow other gods. Yet I would wish you to love physically, to make
      perfect the circle of your union. F. will not do so, therefore, she is useless. If she
      did, she would become useful. You have erred in showing her the true relation between you
      on spiritual planes. Having burst that, she will remain by her sense of power over you.
      (This might mean that her enjoyment of her power over me would induce her to continue
      working.) She is spiritually stronger than you. You should have dominated her by your
      superior strength on other planes. She will give you much trouble, though eventually she
      may become a great aid. But your shorter path lies by Egypt and S. W. (Ouarda) though she
      is not spiritually your equal. S. W. has been your enemy; but you have conquered, she is
      bound to aid you as your will. She has been your enemy and that of F. but you returned her
      hatred, hence her seeming power over you in the present. (Qy. this hearing.) (Qy. was F.
      hearing correctly) I will give you a sign when alone and away from present medium. You
      must recognize the sign by your own intuition. Do not</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{522}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>part from S. W. Use her! (Here S. W. appears, with an evil look. She glitters, like a
      jewelled serpent.) Strange bands of light scintillate between her and Aiwass. A. now takes
      wand again; still feels enmity on spiritual planes. Aiwass banished; S. W. has
      disappeared.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A. now tries to speak to A.'.. He wants G. R.; does not mind whether S. W. is with me
      or not; but I should use Brahmacharya (? if with her, or anyhow), I shall be guided as
      things turn up, as to the truth or falsehood of Aiwass, who is not to be altogether
      distrusted. (I think the opposition is Aiwass's limitation as a servant.) A.'. will give
      us a sign: F's freedom. (I reply that if this comes about in a miraculous manner, well and
      good.) (Note: Her husband died quite unexpectedly not long after this time.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>April 21st. Sol enters Taurus.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Open T.'. with A.'. I.'.. (Possibly ...<strong>1</strong> spoilt it all) asking for
      special aid in --- what follows. F. finds the Nuit ring good; hence probably her hostility
      yesterday was due to lower self.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I.'. of R. H. K. gives glorious material flashes of light, akasic (i.e. ultra-violet)
      and lilac. The god, beheld, will not speak. Asked for a messenger, Aiwass appears. F.,
      suspecting him, puts a pentagram on him; he blurs and becomes dirty and discrowned. F.
      takes wand; but this dissipates him. His real name she says is 270 = INRI. F. uses
      pentagram and shrivels him up to a black charred mass. I ask her to invoke something
      genuine; a white figure without face and with little shape mounts throne. It has a
      glittering rayed corona. Says: (to here F. uses normal tone; hence tone of oracle) &quot;I
      am the God of Vengeance. I am thy Guardian Angel. I would have thee seek thine own soul in
      silence and alone. Take no aid with thee; take no mortal soul but retire and depart from
      mankind.&quot; Pentagram makes him brighter: he grows firmer. Repeated, form vanishes and
      only brightness remains. Asked for a sign of his name ... is written on throne. &quot;I
      will give no other sign: you must learn to trust your own intuition.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>F's intuition tells her that he is genuine. As to our relations, he wishes us to work
      together (A contradiction <em>v. supra</em>:) &quot;I do not wish you to go too far in
      work with S. W. She will dazzle you and be apt to lead you astray. You must always remain
      as armed when you work with her, as a man in full armour. I would wish you to strengthen
      the link between you and F. on all planes. You are very needful to each other and can only
      accomplish G. W. together.&quot; (This clearly utter rubbish.) I take wand and curse him
      by Him who he hath blasphemed. Invoking, however A.'. the light becomes more brilliant.
      Voice continues: &quot;You must go</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{523}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">I omit reference to a certain private matter.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>and do a G. R. after which you will get a sign.&quot; (Clearly due to F. knowing my
    wish; but he is clumsy. Will anything now convince F.? I was trying, as my custom is, to
    &quot;bowl out&quot; my clairvoyant.) I take serious measures to banish all but A.'..
    Voice silenced: and she doubts whether voice is from brilliance. F. feels me absolutely
    necessary for her. I not. (Voice is <em>from her</em> so cannot be banished and it goes
    on:) &quot;There shall be a short period of work (?<em>not</em>?) done in actual unison;
    after which your powers join irrevocably together. There is no escape from that; you are
    bound to work together; and the fitting time and hour for this shall come simultaneously
    to you both. There will then be no doubt in either of your minds: there will then be no
    obstacle to this union ... You must look towards this time and towards a beacon light.
    Never lose sight of that! You Elaine (F's earth-name) will meet with subtle temptation
    from this object --- promises of great power and illumination; but heed them not. Aleister
    is your true helper from whom you have right to look and demand help. You must never cease
    to demand this aid and by your demand strengthen and aid your comrade. I, your Guardian
    Angel, tell you this.&quot; (The falsity of all this patent more at the time than now ---
    I foresaw what follows.) I ask proof that he <em>is</em> G. A. It is clear that voice and
    brilliance are distinct (i.e. from two separate sources.) F. however feels that this
    rigmarole is true. Hence we discuss our relations and the Great Invocation degenerates. We
    began to make love to each other. This, however, is checked by my will and her own feeling
    that we have done enough for honour. I am not exhausted after all this, as I was
    yesterday. Is this a proof that all is Right Magick, or that little force was expended?
    Where am I, in fact? O Holy Exalted One, do Thou illuminate my mind!</p>
