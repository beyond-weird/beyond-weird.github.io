    <p>So when it came to my writing poetry myself, my work fell naturally into three
    divisions. Firstly, short lyrics modelled on the hymns to which I was accustomed;
    secondly, parodies, principally of Scottish and English songs; and thirdly, epics based on
    Sir Walter Scott. I must have written over a hundred thousand lines. They have all been
    destroyed; and I am rather sorry for it. While they possessed no merit, their contents
    would afford a valuable key to my thoughts at the time. The few fragments which escaped
    destruction were reprinted in my <em>Oracles</em>. I remember something of their general
    moral tendency, which was to celebrate the triumph of the revolt of youth and passion
    against age and propriety. I tried to get effect by using extremes of expression. I
    remember two lines from an epic. &quot;Lady Ethelreda&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Baron Ethelred waxed wroth,<br>
            Frothed he with a frothy froth.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But as I grew a little older I became able to manage my material with more discretion.
    My mother designed me, of course, to follow in my father's footsteps as am evangelist, but
    as I had to take a profession she decided she would like me to be a doctor, of the ground
    that &quot;doctors have so many opportunities&quot;. (Scil. for bringing souls to Jesus.
    She did not see anything funny in this remark!) So I began to learn a little about
    medicine and produced the following effusion:</p>
    <p align="center">A PEEP BEHIND THE SCENES</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In the hospital bed she lay<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">..........</font>Rotting away!<br>
        Cursing by night and cursing by day,<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">..........</font>Rotting away!<br>
        The lupus is over her face and head,<br>
        Filthy and foul and horrid and dread,<br>
        And her shrieks they would almost wake the dead;<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">..........</font>Rotting away!<br>
        In her horrible grave she lay,<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">..........</font>Rotting away!<br>
        In the place of her face is a gory hole,</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{82}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>And the worms are gnawing the tissues foul,<br>
        And the devil is gloating over her soul,<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">..........</font>Rotting away!</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that the title of this poem is ironical. It is taken from a goody-goody book,
    popular at that time, which describes the life of traveling barnstormers and how the only
    hope for them was to be converted. But the irony goes somewhat deeper. It was a genuine
    criticism of the shallow philosophy of optimism which went with the polite Christianity of
    the time. I was analysing life in the spirit of Schopenhauer. I couldn't see any sense in
    pretending that life was not full of horrors. Death and trousers are facts in nature; and
    merely to avoid reference to them or to invent euphemisms for them does not alter their
    character. I was reduced to gloating on murder and putrefaction, simply because these
    things gave the most forcible denial to the assumptions current at home. Paganism is
    wholesome because it faces the facts of life; but I was not allowed to take a normal view
    of nature. In my situation, I could not dismiss the falsities of Christianity with a
    smile; I was compelled to fight fire with fire and to oppose their poisoned poultices with
    poisoned daggers.</p>
    <p>Such was the influence of home life. But it was partially interfered with by the more
    decent current of school life. I have mentioned my school in Streatham. It was there that
    occurred the last important incident of this period. Being the star chemist of the school,
    I determined to distinguish myself on the fifth of November, 1891. I procured a ten-pound
    jar from the grocer's, put two pounds of gunpowder at the bottom and filled it up with
    various layers of different coloured &quot;fires&quot;. These were all --- except for the
    small ingredients of varied metallic salts --- of the same composition: sugar and chlorate
    of potash. In order to make sure of success, I turned the whole household on to mixing
    these ingredients, with the result that they were mingled so intimately as to produce what
    was to all intents and purposes chlorate power! I pressed this down very powerfully,
    buried the jar in the playground, stuck a rocket into the top and lighted it at the
    critical moment. The rocket had been fixed too firmly to rise and the protecting wad of
    paper burnt through before I could step back. I neither saw nor heard anything. I felt as
    if a brush of some warm tarry and gritty substance had been passed across my face; and
    found myself standing on the brink of a hole in the ground of no mean size. I wondered how
    on earth it could have happened that my experiment had failed. I remember apologizing for
    the failure and saying that I must go up to the house to wash my face. I discovered that I
    was being supported on the journey by my private tutor and my mother. Then I found myself
    in the headmaster's sanctum, receiving first aid. I remember nothing more for some time
    except the annoyance</p>
    <p>{83}</p>
    <p>of being awakened to have my dressings changed. I slept for ninety-six hours with these
    semi-conscious intervals. My tutor had the sense to wire to Guy's Hospital for Dr. Golding
    Bird, whose intervention probably saved me from erysipelas and the loss of my sight. In
    the course of convalescence, over four thousand pieces of gravel and the like were removed
    from my face; and it was on Christmas Day that I was first allowed to use my eyes for a
    few minutes. The explosion had been devastating. The windows were smashed for a long way
    round; and the bottles in the chemist's shop on the railway bridge --- a quarter of a mile
    and more away --- rattled, though the passage of trains had no such effect. Strangely
    enough, I was the only person injured. Throughout I enjoyed the episode; I was the hero, I
    had made my mark!</p>
    <p>The following year I was ready to go to a public school. My Uncle Jonathan wanted me to
    go to Winchester, as per the family tradition, but my health demanded a more bracing
    climate and it was decided that I should go to Malvern. The school at that time was rising
    to the height of its glory in athletics. We possessed a brilliant bat in Percy Latham; H.
    R. and W. L. Foster were sure to distinguish themselves in one way or another, and the
    youngsters of that famous game-playing family were coming on, ready to take their places
    when the time came. There was also C. J. Burnup as a promising colt.</p>
    <p>In other matters, however, the school had a long way to go. Bullying went on unchecked,
    the prefects being foremost offenders. As a shy, solitary boy in ill-health, incapable of
    football, I naturally got more than my share, and this led ultimately to one of the few
    actions in my life with which I have ever felt inclined to reproach myself. The tone of
    the school was brutal and imbecile. The authorities had done much to stamp out the
    practice of &quot;greasing&quot;, which consists in spitting as smegmatically as possible
    either in people's faces or on their backs. It still flourished at our house,
    Huntingdon's, No. 4, and constituted our only claim to distinction. I do not think we had
    a single member in either of the elevens. The prefects were hulking louts, shirking both
    work and play, and concentrating on obscenity and petty tyranny. It annoyed them
    particularly that my conduct was irreproachable. They could not cane me without the
    housemaster's permission. I did not realize how closely I was being watched, but
    ultimately I committed some trifling breach of discipline during &quot;prep&quot;. After
    the hour was over the prefect in charge gleefully hastened to the housemaster. He found me
    there already. I got my licking; but there was a fine series of expulsions to balance it.
    Of course my action was technically indefensible; but after all, I had held my tongue
    uncomplainingly for months and it was only when they appealed to the housemaster to fight
    their battles that I appealed to him to fight mine.</p>
    <p>{84}</p>
    <p>I may as well emphasize at this moment that I remained amazingly innocent. My study
    companion was actually the favourite &quot;tart&quot; of the house; so much so, that he
    thereby added considerably to his income. But though I was aware of these facts, I had no
    conception whatever of what they implied.</p>
    <p>An anecdote illustrates this fact. It was the custom of our form master to remit twenty
    per cent of any number of lines that might be given one to write if they were delivered
    before the time appointed. It happened that I was set a number of lines by some other
    master and I handed in eighty per cent with the written remark, &quot;Twenty per cent
    deducted as usual for premature delivery.&quot; He thought that I was &quot;getting at
    him&quot;, but on investigation I was acquitted; in fact, I had no idea of any ambiguity.</p>
    <p>My life at Malvern made little impression on me. For the most part I was lost in my own
    thought and touched school life as little as I could, I made no real friends. I had no
    sympathy with the general brutality and refused to pander to it by making myself the
    favourite. The following story helps to illustrate my attitude.</p>
    <p>Some of the prefects were twitting me with cowardice and proposed that I should prove
    my virtue by fighting Smith tertius, a boy much smaller than myself. I refused, observing
    that if I did not fight him I must pass for a coward, and if I did I should be accused of
    bullying, and probably be reported for fighting as well.</p>
    <p>None of my ambitions were connected with the school. I preferred to daydream of my
    plans for mountaineering in the holidays and to busy myself with writing poetry. Memory
    has preserved fragments of two efforts. The first;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Put not thy trust in princes.&quot; 'Tis a speech<br>
        Might thee, O Gordon-Cumming, something teach.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It seems absurd that a boy of my age should take an interest in such matters and become
    so positive a partisan. But I had an ingrained hatred for the Hanoverian usurper and took
    for granted what I still believe to have been the fact, that the man who cheated was not
    Gordon-Cumming.</p>
    <p>Of the second poem I retain:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Poor lady! whom a wicked jury's hate<br>
        In face of facts as iron as the grave<br>
        To which they would have doomed thee -- bitter fate!<br>
        Thee guiltless to the cruel hangman gave.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Shame on the judge who sees but half the facts!<br>
        Shame on the nurse who private letters opes!<br>
        But never shalt thou be forgot by us,<br>
        The pity of thy life's so blasted hopes.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{85}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Lady, hope on! All England takes thy part<br>
        But a few bigots. Lady, then, take heart.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>My sympathy with Mrs. Maybrick nowise argues my belief in her innocence. She was
    admittedly an adulteress. I asked no further questions. The mere fact thrilled me to the
    marrow. Adultery being the summit of wickedness, its commission excused everything.</p>
    <p>I made no intimate friendships. I did my work sufficiently well to avoid serious
    punishment, but without ambition. I took no interest in the Shakespeare prize, for which
    everybody had to enter, and had not read a line of the two plays prescribed, <em>Romeo and
    Juliet</em> and <em>Richard III</em>. But for some reason or other I got scared three days
    before the examination, got excused from games and worked so hard that I came out sixth in
    the school. I was able to quote several long passages accurately from memory. With me, it
    was always a question of the interest which I took in things. I had the makings of a sound
    classical scholar, but I could not bring myself to memorize Greek and Latin poetry.
    Stranger still, I could not master the rules of prosody. My most hostile critics admit
    that my technique and my sense of rhythm are unsurpassed; but the rules of scansion meant
    nothing to me, because no one explained their connection with the way a poem should be
    read.</p>
    <p>I should have liked school life well enough if it had not been for the bullying and the
    complete lack of intellectual companionship. I had no interest in games; my athletic
    ambitions were confined to climbing mountains. But at least there was no Christianity! and
    what morality there was was rather manly than otherwise. However, I was now old enough to
    match myself against my private tutors and found greater freedom with them than at school.
    I decided to leave and drew such a picture of the abominations which went on, though I
    knew nothing about them or even what they were, that my mother refused to let me go back.
    I told her, she once reminded me, that &quot;if Mr. Huntingdon (the housemaster) knew what
    was going on in the house, it would break his heart&quot;. Pure bluff! but the following
    term I was entered at Tonbridge.</p>
    <p>By this time I had acquired a considerable facility in making the best of my
    advantages. I had in some ways much more experience of life than most boys of my age. My
    holidays, what with fishing, mountain climbing and running after girls, were full of
    adventures of one kind and another, in which I was always being thrown on my own
    resources. By the time I reached Tonbridge I had developed a kind of natural aristocracy.
    People were already beginning to be afraid of me and there was no question any longer of
    bullying. My health must have been very much better. Albuminauria breeds melancholy and
    destroys physical courage. I had also, no doubt, been subject to constant irritation do to
    my phimosis and the</p>
    <p>{86}</p>
    <p>operation had relived me. I was, therefore, more or less ready to fight anybody that
    annoyed me. And people took good care not to do so.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere at Tonbridge was, moreover, much more civilized than at Malvern. Today
    it impresses me as having been on the namby-pamby side. There was at that time no trace of
    the marriage system since introduced and now said to be flourishing. &quot;Mrs.
    So-and-so&quot; was almost a term of derision, while now it is exacted by its owner to
    show that he is not &quot;one of those&quot;. My best friend was a brother of C. F. G.
    Masterman. He was neither a sneak nor a hypocrite; but it gives an idea of the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>The glimpse of normal human life afforded by Archibald Douglas had rendered me
    completely sane as far as my conscious life was concerned. The problem of life was not how
    to satanize, as Huysmans would have called it; it was simply to escape from the oppressors
    and to enjoy the world without any interference of spiritual life of any sort. My happiest
    moments were when I was alone on the mountains; but there is no evidence that this
    pleasure in any way derived from mysticism. The beauty of form and colour, the physical
    exhilaration of exercise, and the mental stimulation of finding one's way in difficult
    country, formed the sole elements of my rapture. So far as I indulged in daydreams, they
    were exclusively of a normal sexual type. There was no need to create phantasms of a
    perverse or unrealizable satisfaction. It is important to emphasize this point, because I
    have always appeared to my contemporaries as a very extraordinary individual obsessed by
    fantastic passions. But such were not in any way natural to me. The moment the pressure
    was relieved every touch of the abnormal was shed off instantly. The impulse to write
    poetry disappeared almost completely at such periods. I had not even any of the ordinary
    ambitions of young men. I was content to enjoy sport without wishing to attain eminence in
    it. It came natural to me to find ways up mountains which looked to me interesting and
    difficult. But it never occurred to me to match myself against other people. It was from
    purely aesthetic considerations that I climbed the gullies of Tryfan and Twll Du. This
    last climb landed me, as luck would have it, in a controversy which was destined to
    determine my career in a very remarkable manner.</p>
