    <p>My grand passion was Beachy Head. The fantastic beauty of the cliffs can never be
    understood by anyone who has not grappled them. Mountain scenery of any kind, but
    especially rock scenery, depends largely on foreground. This is especially the case when
    one has acquired an intimate knowledge of the meaning, from the climber's point of view,
    of what the eyes tell one. The ordinary man looking at a mountain is like an illiterate
    person confronted with a Greek manuscript. The only chalk in England which is worth
    reading, so to speak, is that on Beachy Head. This is due to the fact that it is
    relatively so much higher than other similar cliffs. Most chalk cliffs are either unbroken
    precipices, unclimbable in our present stage of the game, or broken-down rubble; but
    Beachy Head offers rock problems as varied, interesting and picturesque as any cliffs in
    the world. I began to explore the face. Popular ignorance had surrounded it with
    innumerable absurd rumours. The general opinion was that no one had ever climbed it. There
    was, however, a legend that it had once been done. I settled the point by walking up,
    smoking a pipe, with my dog (I had no woman available) in nine and a half minutes from the
    beach to the coastguard station.</p>
    <p>My cousin, Gregor Grant, was with me on my earlier climbs. These were the most obvious,
    but also the most important, Etheldreda's Pinnacle --- which I named after my dog, or a
    schoolgirl with whom I had stolen interviews, I forget which --- was the first great
    triumph. The second was the Devil's Chimney, and the third the Cullin Crack. I have always
    refused till now to claim this climb, as I finished it with the moral support of a loose
    rope from above. It would be formidable enough were it of the best rock in the world:
    there is one section which actually overhangs. I believe that these latter climbs have
    never been repeated.</p>
    <p>Chalk is probably the most dangerous and difficult of all kinds of rock. Its condition
    varies at every step. Often one has to clear away an immense amount of debris in order to
    get any hold at all. Yet indiscretion in this operation might pull down a few hundred tons
    on one's head. One can hardly ever be sure that any given hold is secure. It is,
    therefore, a matter of the most exquisite judgment to put on it no more weight than is
    necessary. A jerk or a spring would almost infallibly lead to disaster. One does not climb
    the cliffs. One hardly even crawls. Trickles or oozes would perhaps be the ideal verbs.</p>
    <p>The unique character of the climbing led to an amusing incident. The</p>
    <p>{95}</p>
    <p>greatest rock climber in England, A. F. Mummery, published a short account of his work
    on the cliffs at Dover, where he lived. He stated that at more than twenty to thirty feet
    above sea-level no climbing was possible, and that practically all his climbs were
    traverses; that is horizontal and not vertical. I wrote to him saying that my experience
    was precisely the opposite. All my climbing had been done at greater altitudes, and that
    (with hardly an exception) my climbs were vertical. He wrote back rather superciliously to
    the effect that there were certainly grassy gullies which corresponded to my description,
    but they were not what he called climbing. I replied, thanking him and begging him to
    accept a few photographs of the grassy gullies under description. These showed the most
    formidable-looking pinacles in the British Islands, and vertical cracks as precipitous as
    anything in Cumberland. He wrote back immediately a warm letter of congratulation. It was
    evident that we had been using the word &quot;chalk&quot; to cover two widely different
    species of material.</p>
    <p>I published some of my records in the local newspapers with the idea of inspiring the
    natives with praiseworthy enthusiasm. Once again I had misjudged humanity. All I got was a
    leading article beginning the the words, &quot;Insensate folly takes various forms.&quot;
    Another shock was to come. Cousin Gregor suddenly declared that he was engaged to be
    married and that he didn't think he had the right to climb any more on Beachy Head. My
    boyhood's idol was shattered at a blow. I received my first lesson in what the religions
    of the world have discovered long since, that no man who allows a woman to take any place
    in his life is capable of doing good work. (Similarly, men may be as foolish over dogs as
    old maids over cats.) A man who is strong enough to use women as slaves and playthings is
    all right. Even so, there is always a danger, though it is difficult to avoid it. In fact,
    I don't think it should be avoided. I think a man should train himself to master what are
    commonly called vices, from maidens to morphia. It is undeniable that there are very few
    such men. Again and again I have had the most promising pupils give up the great work of
    their lives for the sake of some wretched woman who could have been duplicated in a Ten
    Cent Store. It doesn't matter what the work is; if it is worth while doing, it demands
    one's whole attention, and a woman is only tolerable in one's life if she is trained to
    help the man in his work without the slightest reference to any other interests soever.
    The necessary self-abnegation and concentration on his part must be matched by similar
    qualities on hers. I say matched --- I might say better, surpassed --- for such devotion
    must be blind. A man can <em>become</em> his work, so that he satisfies himself by
    satisfying it; but a woman is fundamentally incapable of understanding the nature of work
    in itself. She must consent to co-operate with him in the dark. Her self-surrender is,
    therefore, really self-surrender, whereas with him it is</p>
    <p>{96}</p>
    <p>rather self-realization. It is true that if a woman persists long enough in the habit,
    she will ultimately find herself therein. For woman is a creature of habit, that is, of
    solidified impulses. She has no individuality. Attached to a strong man who is no longer
    himself by this work, she may become a more or less reliable mood. Otherwise her moods
    change with her phantasms. But the most dominant mood of woman will always be motherhood.
    Nature itself, therefore, insures that a man who relies on a woman to help him is bucking
    the tiger. At any moment, without warning, her interest in him may be swept off its feet
    and become secondary. Worse --- she will expect her man to abandon the whole interest of
    his life in order to look after her new toy. A bitch does not lose all her interest in her
    master just because she has puppies.</p>
    <p>I found a new climbing companion on Beachy Head in a man named J. S. New. We worked out
    the possible climbs systematically and made a largescale map of the cliff. I ultimately
    contributed an illustrated article on the subject to the <em>Scottish Mountaineering
    Journal</em>. But with the exception of Mr. H. S. Bullock, and one or two others who
    repeated a few of our climbs and made one or two new ones, little work has been done on
    the Head. Climbers generally seem to have come to the conclusion that it was altogether
    too dangerous. It must be admitted that, at any rate, it is very unpleasant. In wet
    weather the chalk forms a paste which clogs the boots and makes foothold impossible. In
    dry weather the dust takes possession of the eyes and throat. But for all that, may of my
    happiest days have been spent on the face.</p>
    <p>I must record a very strange phenomenon in connection with my adventures on Beachy
    Head. One summer day I went up with my mother and took her down to the grassy slopes (the
    Grass Traverse) which used to extend eastward from Etheldreda's Pinnacle. I say &quot;used
    to extend&quot;, for since that time there has been an extensive landslide. It was rather
    a scramble for an old lady to reach them from the top of the cliff, but it could be done
    by descending a narrow gully called Etheldreda's Walk. I put her in a comfortable position
    where she could make a water-colour sketch, and went off to do some climbing on the
    Devil's Chimney, which is some distance west of the pinnacle. The general contour of the
    cliff is here convex, so that I was entirely out of her sight, besides being a quarter of
    a mile away. Such breeze as there was was blowing from the south-west, that is, from me to
    her. I was trying to make a new climb on the west of the Devil's Chimney and had got some
    distance down, when I distinctly heard her crying for help. At this time I had no
    acquaintance with psychic phenomena, yet I recognized the call as of this type; that is, I
    had a direct intuition that it was so. It was not merely that it seemed improbable that it
    could be normal audition. I did not know at the time for certain that this was impossible,</p>
    <p>{97}</p>
    <p>though it was afterwards proved to be so by experiment. I had no reason for supposing
    the danger to be urgent: but I rushed madly to the top of the cliff, along it and down to
    the Grass Traverse. I reached her in time to save her life, though there were not many
    seconds to spare. She had shifted her position to to get a better view and had wandered
    off the traverse on to steep, dusty, crumbling slopes. She had begun to slip, got
    frightened and done the worst thing possible; that is, had sat down. She had been slipping
    by inches and was on the brink of a cliff when I reached her. She had actually cried for
    help at the time when I heard her, as nearly as I could judge; but, as explained above, it
    was physically impossible for me to have done so. I regard this incident as very
    extraordinary indeed. I have never taken much stock in the regular stories of people
    appearing at a distance at the moment of death and so on; nor does the fact of something
    so similar having actually happened to me make me inclined to believe such stories. I
    cannot offer any explanation, apart from the conventional magical theory that a supreme
    explosion of will is sometimes able to set forces in motion which cannot be invoked in
    ordinary circumstances.</p>
    <p>To return to my subject. Despite the regrettable incident of impulsive humanitarianism
    above recorded, my associations with Beachy Head possess a charm which I have never known
    in any other district of England. My climbs there fulfilled all my ideals of romance, and
    in addition I had the particularly delightful feeling of complete originality. In other
    districts I could be no more than <em>primus inter pares</em>. On Beachy Head I was the
    only one --- I had invented an entirely new branch of the sport.</p>
    <p>For a number of weeks I slept in a Mummery tent on one of the traverses. It was my
    first experience of camp life, which is, one thing with another, the best life I know. The
    mere feeling of being in the fresh air under the stars when one goes to sleep, and of
    waking at dawn because it is dawn, raises one's animal life <em>ipso facto</em> to the
    level of poetry.</p>
    <p>There have always been in me two quite incompatible personalities with regard to my
    judgment of men and in practical matters. One of them possesses great instinctive
    shrewdness partaking of cynicism; the other an innocence amounting almost to imbecility. <em>Der
    reine Thor!</em> In certain respects, this later quality is calculated. Thus, I have
    always refused to believe that I am being cheated, even when I know the facts perfectly
    well. I have deliberately made up my mind that it is not worth while to allow my purity to
    be contaminated by descending to the level of the people who are swindling me. In some
    matters again, I am genuinely unable to criticize; and so I take people at their face
    value, occasionally with disastrous results.</p>
    <p>For instance, one of the most original characters that I have ever met was the Rev. T.
    C. V. Bastow, of Little Peatling Rectory, Lutterworth. It was the proud boast of this
    gentleman, who used to spend his vacations at Wastdale</p>
    <p>{98}</p>
    <p>Head, that he possessed a rudimentary tail; and though I was never favoured personally
    with a view of this distinction, he was credited with readiness to demonstrate the
    Darwinian theory to any earnest young anatomist who might be in the offing. He wandered
    about the crags with a three-pronged claw attached to twenty or thirty feet of rope, his
    theory being to throw it up the rocks till it caught somewhere, and then swarm up the
    rope. He gave himself the air of being a rock climber of the first rank and I never
    thought of doubting it.</p>
    <p>Now I had made the first solitary descent of the Ennerdale face of the Pillar Rock, a
    feat at that time considered theoretically impossible. He asked me casually whether it was
    the sort of place that he could take his daughter. I did a sort of rule of three sum in my
    head. If poor little I, the beginner, could do it, a fortiori so could the great man, even
    with the handicap of the girl novice. As a matter of fact, he could not climb at all, and
    the delightful pair found themselves crag-fast.</p>
    <p>Some years later I made a blunder of the same kind which resulted in a frightful
    tragedy. I was in Arolla in 1897<strong>1</strong> with Morris Travers and his younger
    brother. In Coolidge's Guide there is a record of the ascent of the Petite Dent de Veisivi
    by the gap facing Arolla. The local guides, however, unanimously denied that this route
    had ever been done. The rocks below the gap, they said, were overhanging and were
    impossible. We decided to test these statements, ascended the mountain by the ordinary way
    and came down by the route in question. The rocks do overhang, but the holds are so good
    that the climb is quite easy. We discussed the climb with a son of the celebrated Dr. John
    Hopkinson, Edward, who was there with a large family. We said, quite truthfully, that
    there was no difficulty or danger for a responsible party; but he and three of his
    children attempted to repeat our climb and all were killed. A peculiarly English incident
    adds a touch of grotesque grimness to the story. The widow begged Travers, who was a
    member of the rescue party (I had left the valley), to allow her to take a last look at
    her husband. She had been brought up to fancy pictures of people lying in state ---
    &quot;calm and grand in Death&quot;, and that sort of thing . As a matter of fact, all the
    remains had been brought down in one sack; no one could tell what was whose.</p>
    <p>This difficulty in understanding that professed climbers could be incurably incompetent
    culminated in the one great mistake of my mountaineering career. Despite the actual
    evidence of 1902 that Dr. Jacot Guillarmod was utterly ignorant and untrustworthy, vain
    and obstinate, I consented to take him to Kangchenjunga, with the disastrous result to be
    recorded later.</p>
    <p>There remains one remarkable incident of my climbing in Cumberland. I had been trying
    some new routes on the Pillar Rock one day, when I was</p>
    <p>{99}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">See <em>Collected Works</em>, vol. 1, p. 127.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>caught by a terrific thunderstorm. Luckily for me, as it turned out, I was soaked to
    the skin in ten minutes. Any further serious climbing being impossible, I started back to
    Wastdale. In doing this one crosses the ridge of Pillar Mountain, along which runs a wire
    sheep fence. I crossed this; and, the storm increasing in violence, my attention was
    attracted by the little flames of lightning that played upon the iron uprights. I forgot
    about my axe. The next thing I knew was that I had been knocked down. I can hardly say
    that I felt any definite electrical shock; but I knew what must have happened. I was
    seized by a curious mixture of exhilaration and terror; and dashed down the face of the
    mountain at its steepest point, leaping from rock to rock like a goat. I easily beat the
    record from the summit to the hotel! Despite the intense concentration<strong>1</strong>
    necessary to jump down the dangerous crags, my conscious attention was absorbed by the
    magnificent spectacle of the cliffs of Scafell, framed in lurid purple storm clouds and
    literally ablaze with lightning; continuous and vivid to a degree that I have never since
    seen except on one occasion near Madrid, when the entire sky was a kaleidoscopic network
    of flame for nearly two hours.</p>
