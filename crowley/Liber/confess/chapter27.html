    <p>I sailed for Ceylon, chiefly because I had said I would go, certainly not in the hope
    of assistance from Allan. Perhaps because I had found my feet, he was, as will appear,
    allowed to guide them, in what seemed at first sight a new Path. I had got to learn that
    all roads lead to Rome. It is proper, more, it is prudent, more yet, it is educative, for
    the aspirant to pursue all possible Ways to Wisdom. Thus he broadens the base of his
    Pyramid, thus he diminishes the probability of missing the method which happens to suit
    him best, thus he insures against the obsession that the goat-track of his own success in
    the One Highway for all men, and thus he discounts the disappointment of discovering that
    he is not the Utter, the Unique, when it becomes plain that Magick, mysticism, and the
    mathematics are triplets, and that the Himalayan Brotherhood is to be found in Brixton.</p>
    <p>I say little of Singapore; I say enough when I say that its curries, with their vast
    partitioned platter of curious condiments to lackey them, speak for themselves. They sting
    like serpents, stimulate like strychnine; they are subtle and sensual like Chinese
    courtesans, sublime and sacred, inscrutably inspiring and unintelligibly illumination,
    like Cambodian carvings.</p>
    <p>Of Penang I will observe only that its one perfect product is the &quot;Penang
    Lawyer&quot;. But I should like to hear of any other city which can say the same!</p>
    <p>As to Colombo, I love it and loathe it with nicely balanced enthusiasm. Its climate is
    chronic; its architecture is an unhappy accident; its natives are nasty, the men with long
    hair cooped up by a comb, smelling of fish, the women with waists bulging black between
    coat and skirt, greasy with coconut oil, and both chewing betel and spitting it out till
    their teeth ooze with red and the streets look like shambles; its English are exhausted
    and enervated. The Eurasians are anaemic abortions; the burghers --- Dutch halfcasts ---
    stolid squareheads; the Portuguese piebalds sly sneaks, vicious, venal, vermiform
    villains. The Tamils are black but not comely. The riff-raff of rascality endemic in all
    ports is here exceptionally repulsive. The highwater mark of social tone, moral elevation,
    manners and refinement is attained by the Japanese ladies of pleasure.</p>
    <p>In the matter of religion, the Hindus are (as everywhere else) servile, shallow,
    cowardly and hypocritical; though being mostly Shaivites, adoring frankly the power of
    Procreation and Destruction, they are less loathsome than Vishnavites, who cringe before a
    fetish who promises them Preservation and (as Krishna) claims to be the Original of which
    Christ is a copy.</p>
    <p>{232}</p>
    <p>The Christians are, of course, obscene outcasts from even the traditional tolerance of
    their clan; they have accepted Jesus with the promise of a job, and gag conscience with
    assurance of atonement, or chloroform superstitious terrors by ruminating on redemption.
    The Buddhists are sodden with their surfeit of indigestible philosophy and feebly flaunt a
    fluttering formula of which the meaning is forgotten; the debauchery of devil dances, the
    pointless profession of Pansil (the Five Precepts of the Buddha), the ceremonial coddling
    of shrines as old maids coddle cats, voluble veneration and rigmarole religion: such is
    the threadbare tinsel which they throw over the nakedness of their idleness, immorality
    and imbecility.</p>
    <p>Indians plausibly maintain that some god got all the worst devils into Ceylon, and then
    cut it off from the continent by the straits.</p>
    <p>But then, how rich, how soft, how peaceful is Colombo! One feels that one needs never
    do anything any more. It invites one to dream deliciously of deciduous joys --- and
    insists, with velvet hand, light and bright as a butterfly's wing, on the eyelids. The
    palms, the flowers, the swooning song of the surf, the dim and delicate atmosphere heavy
    with sensuous scents, the idle irresponsible people, purring with placid pleasure; they
    seem musicians in an orchestra, playing a nocturne by some oriental Chopin unconscious of
    disquieting realities.</p>
    <p>But more, Colombo is the &quot;place where four winds meet&quot;, the crossroads of the
    civilized world. Westward lies Europe, the energetic stripling, who thought to bear the
    world on his shoulders, but could not co-ordinate his own muscles. Northward lies India,
    like a woman weary of bearing, a widow holding to her ancient habits without hope.
    Southward, Australia, topsy-turvy as our childhood's wisdom warned us, sprawls its awkward
    adolescence and embarrasses its elders by its unconscious absurdity. Lastly, look
    eastward! There lies China; there is the only civilization that has looked time in the
    face without a blush; an atheism with good manners. There broods the old wise man, he who
    has conquered life without the aid of death, who may survive these strenuous youths and
    even the worn barren widow mumbling meaningless memories in her toothless mouth.</p>
    <p>In Colombo this world problem solves itself; for the Indian toils, without ambition or
    object, from sheer habit; the European bosses things, with selfimportance and brafado; the
    Australian lumbers in and out, loutishly, hoping not to be seen; and China, silent and
    absent, conveys majestically patriarchal reproof by simply ignoring the impertinence.
    Slightly as I had brushed against the yellow silken robes of China in the press of
    jostling cultures, its virtue had so entered into me that the positive and aggressive
    aspects of Colombo, tumultuously troubling through they were, failed to command my full
    attention. As you vainly ply an opium smoker who craves his pipe with wine, with woman and
    with song, so the insolent insistence of the actualities</p>
    <p>{233}</p>
    <p>of Colombo merely annoyed me; I was intensely aware of one thing only, the absence of
    the clossal calm and common sense of China.</p>
    <p>Experience has taught me that imponderables are all-important; when science declares
    that it can concern itself only with that which can be measured, it classes itself with
    the child that counts on its fingers and brands Shakespeare and Shelley as charlatans. I
    am not ashamed of such company; let me say then that the silent stress of my contact with
    the fringe of Chinese civilization operated in me the cure of my accursed European anxiety
    about my conduct. It is at least the fact that I met Allan with absolute sang-froid. I
    felt no need of confession. I had no sense of shame or inferiority. I had not favour to
    ask. I had perfect confidence in myself. We were interested in the same Quest, that was
    all; it was natural that we should exchange views.</p>
    <p>Behold then! Allan, though the pupil of a Shaivite guru, was already at heart a
    Buddhist; and the miracle about Buddha, from the ethnological standpoint, is that an
    Aryan, by dint of sheer psychological acumen, should have come so near to understanding
    the Chinese mind. The fundamental weakness of Buddhism is that it fails to attain the
    indifference of Lao-Tzu. Buddha wails for Nibbana as the sole refuge from sorrow; Lao-Tzu
    despises sorrow as casually as he despises happiness and is content to reach equably to
    every possible impression.</p>
    <p>Must I digress to excuse Allan Bennett, the noblest and the gentlest soul that I have
    ever known? Surely the immanence of physical agony, the continual anguish of the cross on
    which he has been nailed for more than fifty years, he not complaining, he not submitting,
    he not demanding release, but working inexorably and inexpugnably at this appointed Task
    --- surely the unremitting stroke of that fell fact must have avenged itself for its
    foiled malice by fashioning his conception of the universe in the same form as seemed
    omnivalent to the Buddha, who could not estimate the influence of his vain desolating
    years of idle luxury and the abortive atonement of his random reaction to angry
    asceticism.</p>
    <p>Allan never knew joy; he disdained and distrusted pleasure from the womb. Is it strange
    that he should have been unable to conceive life as aught but ineluctable and fatuous
    evil? For myself, I saw pleasure as puerile, sorrow as senile; I was ready, when mine hour
    should arrive, to accept either amicably or dismiss both disdainfully.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, I was simply an adept --- wandering round the world in the way adepts have
    --- bent on picking up any pearls that proved their pedigrees from honest oysters and were
    guaranteed rejected by swine.</p>
    <p>So, when I saw Allan, I put my question, referred to above, and got my answer.</p>
    <p>The official record is subjoined.</p>
    <p>{234}</p>
    <p>D.D.C.F., Mathers, had told me a certain incident which had taken place between himself
    and Bennett as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>He and I.A. had disagreed upon an obscure point in theology, thereby formulating the
      accursed Dyad, thereby enabling the Abra-Melin demons to assume material form: one in his
      own shape, another in that of I.A. Now, the demon that looked like I.A. had a revolver,
      and threatened to shoot him (D.D.C.F.), while the demon that resembled himself was equally
      anxious to shoot I.A. Fortunately, before the demons could fire, V.N.R. (Mrs. Mathers)
      came into the room, thus formulating the symbol of the Blessed Trinity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Frater I.A.'s account was less of a strain upon P.'s faculties of belief. They had had,
      he said, an argument about the God Shiva, the Destroyer, whom I.A. worshipped because, if
      one repeated his name often enough, Shiva would one day open his eye and destroy the
      universe, and whom D.D.C.F. feared and hated because He would one day open His eye and
      destroy D.D.C.F. I.A. closed the argument by assuming the position Padmasana and repeating
      the Mantra: &quot;Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.&quot; D.D.C.F., angrier than
      ever, sought the sideboard, but soon returned, only to find Frater I.A. still muttering:
      &quot;Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.&quot; &quot;Will you stop blaspheming?&quot;
      cried D.D.C.F.; but the holy man only said: &quot;Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
      Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.&quot; &quot;If you don't stop I will shoot you!&quot; said
      D.D.C.F., drawing a revolver from his pocket and leveling it at I.A.'s head; but I.A.,
      being concentrated, took no notice and continued to mutter: &quot;Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
      Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Whether overawed by the majesty of the saint or interrupted by the entry of a third
      person, I.A. no longer remembered, but D.D.C.F. never pulled the trigger.</p>
      <p>Mathers thus disposed of, to business!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What of the Great Work? Did it become absurd with Mathers? No more than Everest ceases
    to attract when the Alpine Club caps incompetence with manslaughter!</p>
    <p>We simply dismissed from our minds the whole question of the G.'. D.'. and restated the
    problem on first principles.</p>
    <p>In this situation, I had the advantage of wider reading and more varied experience than
    Allan; he, that of more intensive training, and especially of his recent initiation into
    Asiatic arcana under the aegis of Shri Parananda, Solicitor-General of Ceylon (as Aramis
    was a musketeer) <em>per interim</em>, and a yogi <em>cap-à-pied</em>. I had learnt
    modesty from Eckenstein's engineering epithets and Mexican mountains; so I shut up --- as
    Doris Gomez once immortally observed, at the conclusion of a prolonged and uninterrupted
    harangue, &quot;If</p>
    <p>{235}</p>
    <p>you've got anything more to say, shut up!&quot; --- and concentrated on learning the
    least lemma of his lore instead of inflicting on him my own intimations of immortality.</p>
    <p>He expressed the elements of Yoga. I said, &quot;Your health will improve in a climate
    less addicted to damp and damnability: come to Kandy; we'll get a bungalow and get busy.
    Damn Shri Parananda! Let him excel his commentary on St. Matthew, where he explains the
    discrepancy with another Evangelist by suggesting that &quot;Jesus road both an ass and a
    mule, one foot on each, after the manner of a circus&quot;, if you can. You shall get
    ready to take the Yellow Robe while you train me to triumph over Tanha, and attain Asana,
    and perform Pranayama, and practise Pratyhara, and do Dharana, and demand Dhyana, and swat
    Samadhi, all same No. 1 topside Master Patanjali, heap holy pidgin!&quot;</p>
    <p>An appeal couched in such chastely correct yet politely passionate phraseology could
    not fail to bury its barb in the bull's eye. Allan &quot;prayed permission to quit the
    presence&quot; of the pious Prananda, whose arrogance and meanness be equated with his
    scholarship and sanctity. We sampled Kandy --- which has delights (permit the pun for the
    advertisement!) unsuspected by &quot;Mary Elizabeth&quot;. We took a furnished bungalow
    called &quot;Marlobrough&quot; (God knows why!) on the hills, by a stream, with waterfall
    complete, overlooking the lake, the temple and an amateur attempt at an hotel. We hired a
    hopeless headman, who sub-hired sleepy and sinister servants and dismissed all these
    damnable details from our minds, devoting ourselves with diabolical determination and
    saintly simplicity to the search for a spiritual solution to the material muddle. Our
    sojourn, short as it was by worldly reckoning, proved to be pregnant with events of
    internal import. The tyrant time took his first wound in Kandy.</p>
