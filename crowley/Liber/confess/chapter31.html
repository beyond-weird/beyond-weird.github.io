    <p>In course of time I arrived at Madras, which is sleepy, sticky and provincial. On one
    of my steamship journeys I had met a delightful man named harry Lambe, who had invited me
    to come and stay with him in Calcutta. It fitted in ideally and I booked my passage by the
    steamer <em>Dupleix</em>. It would have been more natural to go by train; but part of my
    plan in wandering about the world was to put myself in unpleasant situations on purpose,
    provided that they were new. This small French boat offered an adventure.</p>
    <p>A storm was raging; the <em>Dupleix</em> was some days late, and when she arrived, it
    was too rough for her to come into the harbour. I had to row out to her in an open boat. I
    had dismissed my servant and was the only passenger from shore. I note the fact as showing
    that I had in a sense broken with the past; the point will appear in a few paragraphs.</p>
    <p>The voyage was atrocious; the ship stank of oil, partly from the engines, partly from
    the cooking and partly from the crew. The storm continued unabated. We passed close to the
    lightship off the mouth of the Hooghly in thick sea fog; the people on the lightship are
    often five weeks or more without being able to communicate with the rest of the world. But
    we got a pilot on board somehow and once in the river itself the weather cleared.</p>
    <p>The Hooghly is reputed the most difficult and dangerous navigation in the world and its
    pilots are the best paid men afloat. Ours allowed me to spend part of the time with him on
    the bridge and put me up to the ropes. The sandbanks are constantly shifting; even the
    shores alter from day to day; the river suddenly chops off a large chunk of corner or
    throws up a false bank. A large staff of men is therefore constantly engaged in sounding
    for the channel and putting up new signposts on the banks. The chart of the river has to
    be revised every day. Even so, the channel is narrow and tortuous. The course of the ship
    reminded me of the most elaborate Continental figureskating.</p>
    <p>Lambe was at the wharf to meet me and drove me off to his house, a large building in a
    compound, as gardens surrounded by a wall are called in India. It was a colony of four
    men, with one of whom, Edward Thornton, I soon struck up an intimacy based on implicit
    sympathy in the matter of philosophical speculation.</p>
    <p>Before I had been in the house three days, a curious incident occurred. I am always
    absent-minded. A current of thought flows through the back of</p>
    <p>{259}</p>
    <p>my brain quite independent of what I am consciously doing. I might even say that the
    above statement is incorrect. Most of the time I am more conscious of what I am thinking
    than of what I am saying and doing. Now there was an animated conversation at dinner about
    the absurdity of the native mind; the curious ideas that they got into their heads; and I
    &quot;awoke&quot; to hear someone say, as an illustration of this thesis, that the
    servants of the house were very excited by my arrival because I had penetrated into the
    temple at Madura and sacrificed a goat. I had said nothing to my friends about my interest
    in Magick and religion, and they were much astonished when I told them that their servants
    were right. I explained how I had cut communications at Madras and wanted to know how the
    servants could possibly have found out the facts.</p>
    <p>This let to conversation about the &quot;native telegraph&quot;. It is an established
    fact that the bazaars get accurate information of events ahead of electricity.
    Mouth-to-mouth communication does not explain it. For instance, the death of an officer in
    a frontier skirmish in some place isolated from India by long stretches of uninhabited
    country has been reported in Bombay before the field telegraph has transmitted the news.</p>
    <p>But I was already sufficiently advanced in practical Magick to understand how this
    could be done. On one occasion I wanted to prepare a ritual which involved the use of
    certain words which I did not know. I travelled in my astral body to see a brother of the
    Order whom I knew to be in possession of the required information, eight thousand miles
    and more away, and obtained it at once.</p>
    <p>My first business at Calcutta was to learn Hindustani and Balti, in order to be an
    efficient interpreter on the expedition to Chogo Ri. As regards the latter, I had to
    content myself with the grammar and filed to learn much. Fortunately, we managed without
    it; but it was easy to get a munshi to teach me Hindustani and I spent most of my time in
    acquiring that<br>
    language.</p>
    <p>The &quot;native telegraph&quot; now reappeared in a different form. Somehow or other
    my munshi got it into his head that I was a Magician. This was very curious, as I had done
    practically no Magick since landing in Ceylon and certainly had not talked about it at
    all. <em>The Sword of song</em> bears witness to the completeness with which I had
    abandoned Magick. I had not in the least lost my faith in its efficacy: I regarded it very
    much as I regarded rock climbing. I could not doubt that I was the best rock climber of my
    generation, but I knew that my abilities in that respect would not help me to climb Chogo
    Ri any more than my ability at billiards would help me to understand Dostoyevsky.
    Similarly, my magical attainment had no bearing on my Quest. Of course I was wrong. I had
    simply failed to understand the possibilities of Magick. I had not realized that it was
    the practical side of spiritual progress.</p>
    <p>{260}</p>
    <p>Ultimately, my Magick proved more far-reaching in importance than my mysticism, as will
    appear in due course.</p>
    <p>My munshi must have possessed some secret source of information about me. His attitude
    towards me expressed not merely the servility of the conquered race; it added the
    childlike timidity of primitive people in presence of occult omnipotence. Having
    ingratiated himself by all the arts of the courtier, he plucked up courage to request me
    to kill his aunt. I am ashamed to say that I dissolved in laughter. I no longer remember
    how I kept my face; how I broke it to him gently that I killed strangers on on such
    considerations as the uninitiated could not possibly comprehend. I still laugh to remember
    the shamefaced shyness of his request and the pained humiliation with which he received my
    refusal. He had the courage (a week or so later) to ask me to soften the hearts of the
    examiners towards his brother, who was entered for the B. A. examination; when I refused,
    he asked me to prophesy the result. I told him that his brother would fail, which he did.
    I claim no credit for second sight; I had based my judgment on the reflection that if his
    brother required magical assistance in order to pass, he knew that his intellectual
    attainments were inadequate.</p>
    <p>When I wasn't working I went racing. I had never been to a race course in England. I
    cannot force myself to pretend interest in a game of which I do not know the rules. Like
    all commercialized amusements, racing is essentially crooked. But in Calcutta it was less
    trouble to go than to stay away. I took advantage of the circumstances to test my
    theories. One particular horse had arrived in Calcutta with a great reputation. Everybody
    backed it and it lost race after race. I waited till it had become so discredited that I
    could get long odds against it in an important race, and then backed it to win, which it
    did. It was merely a question of following the psychology of the swindlers. They had
    pulled it till it was worth while to let it win.</p>
    <p>I had little real pleasure in rattling the rupees in my pocket. My cynical disgust with
    the corrupt pettiness of humanity, far from being assuaged by the consciousness of my
    ability to outmanoeuvre it, saddened me. I loved mankind; I wanted everybody to be an
    enthusiastic aspirant to the absolute. I expected everybody to be as sensitive about
    honour as I was myself. My disillusionment drove me more and more to determine that the
    only thing worth doing was to save humanity from the horror of its own ignorant
    heartlessness. But I was still innocent to the point of imbecility. I had not analysed
    human conduct: I did not understand in the least the springs of human action. Its blind
    bestiality was a puzzle which appalled me, yet I could not even begin to estimate its
    elements.</p>
    <p>Allan Bennett</a> had made up his mind to take the
    Yellow Robe --- not in Ceylon, where the sodden corruption of the Sangha sickened his
    sincerity, but in Burma, where the bhikkhus could at least boast fidelity to the
    principles</p>
    <p>{261}</p>
    <p>of the Buddha, and whose virtuous lives vindicated their good faith. He had gone to
    Akyab on the western coast of Burma, and was living in a monastery called Lamma Sayadaw
    Kyoung. I thought I would drop in on him and pass the time of day; and proposed to combine
    with this act of fraternity the adventure of crossing the Arakan hills, the range which
    forms the watershed between the valley of the Irrawaddy and the sea. This journey, very
    short in measured miles, is reputed so deadly that it has only been accomplished by very
    few men. These left most of their party to moulder in the mountains and themselves died
    within a few days of completing the crossing. I have always had this peculiar passion for
    putting myself in poisonous perils. Its source is presumably my congenital masochism, and
    the <em>Travellers' Tales</em> of Paley Gardner had determined its form of expression.</p>
    <p>Edward Thornton decided to join me on this expedition. We sailed for Rangoon on the
    twenty-first of January. During the whole of my stay in Calcutta I had been intermittently
    ill with malaria. I had been reading Deussen's exposition of Vedanta and found it utterly
    unsatisfactory. Yet Vendata is the fine flower of Hinduism, the sole solution of the
    problems presented by the crude animism of the Vedas. &quot;And if these things are done
    in the green tree --- ?&quot; I was being forced, without knowing it, towards Buddhism; my
    wish to see Allan again was doubtless due to this dilemma rather than to any instincts of
    friendship. As significant of the state of my soul, vague yet vehement, I may quote
    certain entries in my diary thus:</p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" cellpadding="3">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">Jan. 13.</td>
        <td>Early morning walk --- deep meditation. Developed a sort of inverted Manichaeism.
        Nature as evil and fatal force developing within itself (unwittingly) a suicidal will
        called Buddha or Christ.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top">Jan. 15.</td>
        <td>It is a fallacy that the absolute must be the all-good, etc. There is <em>not</em> an
        intelligence directing law --- line of least resistance. Its own selfishness has not even
        the wit to prevent Buddha arising. We cannot call nature <em>evil</em>. &quot;Fatal&quot;
        is the exact word. Necessity implies stupidity --- this the chief attribute of nature. As
        to &quot;supreme intelligence&quot;, consider how many billion years were required to
        develop even so low a thing as emotion.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p>The Rangoon River remains one of the deepest impressions of my life. It
    reminded me of the Neva, though Petrograd is immensely more important. But there is the
    same terrifying breadth of torrent, much more rapid and turbulent than one expects from
    the limitless levels through which it rushes; one gets the idea of sterile, heartless
    passion in the midst of a wilderness, and somehow or other this seems obscenely unnatural.
    One instinctively associates vehemence with detailed result; and when one seen such
    stupendous forces</p>
    <p>{262}</p>
    <p>running to waste, one is subconsciously remended of the essence of human tragedy, the
    callousness of nature about our craving to reap the reward of our efforts. One has to be a
    philosopher to endure the consciousness of waste, and something more than a philosopher to
    admire the spendthrift splendour of the universe.</p>
    <p>The glory of Rangoon is, of course, the Shwe Dagon pagoda. It is gilded and gigantic,
    and the effect is curiously annoying, for very much the same reason as the river is
    appalling. But it enables one to understand the soul of Asia. At the base of the dagoba is
    a vast circular platform, ringed with shops, mostly dedicated to commercial piety and
    cumbered with devotees, beggars and monsters. It is the rendezvous of the ragged, the
    diseased and the deformed, charity to whom is supposed to confer &quot;merit&quot;. Merit
    means insurance against reincarnation in undesirable conditions. Among Buddhists,
    generally speaking, good deeds are always done with some such objects. A rich woman who is
    childless will plaster an existing dagoba with gold leaf, or build a new one, in the hope
    of becoming fruitful.</p>
    <p>The method by which this Magick is supposed to operate is somewhat obscure. There is no
    question of propitiating an offended deity in canonical Buddhism; but in point of fact, it
    is probable that the custom is a survival of pre-Buddhistic fetishism. There are
    innumerable traces of the old demonology in the practical life of the people. Buddhism did
    not succeed in supplanting prevailing superstitions any more than did Christianity or
    Islam. The fact is that the instincts of ignorant people invariably find expression in
    some form of witchcraft. It matters little what the metaphysician or the moralist may
    inculcate; the animal sticks to his subconscious ideas.</p>
    <p>On a litter in the shadow of the pagoda lay a boy of about fourteen years. He suffered
    from hydrocephalus. An enormous head, horrifyingly inane, surmounted a shrivelled body,
    too feeble even to support it. There indeed was a manifest symbol of the universe as
    conceived by the Buddha! Senseless suffering proves that nature has no purpose or pity.
    The existence of a single item of this kind in the inventory demonstrates the theorem. As
    I gazed on the child, I began to understand that all the syllogisms of optimism were
    enthymemes. Every telology depends on the error of generalizing from a few selected
    phenomena. The boy impressed me more than the pagoda. One was the freak of misfortune; the
    other the considered climax of colossal care. Yet both were transitory and trivial toys of
    time. I went back to Rangoon profoundly penetrated by the insight which enabled the Buddha
    to attain understanding of the import of the cosmos.</p>
    <p>Ever since leaving Ceylon I had been almost constantly down with malaria. In Rangoon
    the fever assumed a remittent form: I lived on quinine and iced champagne. The persistence
    of the disease brought me to a state in which I not longer struggled to recover my
    ordinary health. I lived on a low level,</p>
    <p>{263}</p>
    <p>without desire even to die. I began to understand the psychology of Allan. My mind was
    abnormally clear: I was cleansed of the contamination of desire. Nothing was worth wishing
    for; I did not even complain of suffering. This state of mind is a useful experience.
    Something very similar can be induced artificially by fasting.</p>
    <p>I recovered quite suddenly, though the cachexia continued. I was quite well, but felt
    extraordinarily weak. The curious thing about malaria is that one seems to lack strength
    to life a finger, and yet one can do the day's work with astonishing endurance. One makes
    up one's mind that one can't be any worse, and one's muscles are freed from the inhibition
    of fatigue just as they are if one anaesthetizes oneself with cocaine. I have walked
    thirty-five miles in sweltering heat through the most difficult jungle, carrying a heavy
    rifle, when I simply had not the strength to swallow my breakfast. One learns to live on a
    level of invalidism. Most Europeans accustomed to the tropics acquire this aptitude; they
    go on, year after year, apathetically carrying out their routine. They have got beyond
    disappointment and ambition.</p>
    <p>I remember visiting a forest officer up country in Ceylon. We dined with him on the
    eternal monotony of chicken under various disguises and canned meats. Everything tastes
    alike. He had no conversation; he tried to entertain us by turning on a worn-out
    gramophone, as he had done to relive his evenings ever since the instrument was invented.
    He was an old man and could have retired on his pension two years earlier, but he had lost
    all interest in life. What was the sense of his going to England? He had no friends, no
    family, no future! He had become part of the jungle. The psychology is common to all but
    men of rare intelligence and energy. They cling childishly to the skirts of civilization
    by drearily dressing fro their dreary dinner; but everything becomes formal and
    meaningless. Unable to force an answer from the sphinx of their surroundings, they are
    petrified into its stony silence, which yet does not share its sublimity because it has
    neither shape nor soul.</p>
    <p>In order to cross the Arakans to Akyab, we obtained various credentials from the
    authorities, especially a letter to the forest commissioner of the district that he might
    provide us with elephants. We engaged a servant, a man from Madras, whose name was Peter.
    The first question one asks of a servant in India is: his religion? Peter amused us by
    replying that he was &quot;a free man, a Roman Catholic&quot;. Outside subscribers to
    missionary societies, everyone is aware what is implied by the term &quot;native
    Christians&quot;. Anyone who is such an absolute scoundrel as to exceed the very wide
    latitude of his environment, who makes himself intolerable to his family, friends and
    neighbours, cuts the painter and &quot;finds Jesus&quot;. Conversion is a certificate of
    incorrigible rascality. We should not have taken a Christian if we could have found anyone
    else who spoke English and Hindustani. The inconceivable pettiness of the thefts</p>
    <p>{264}</p>
    <p>of Peter was to me a revelation of the possibilities of human degradation. It was
    combined with such cowardice of conscience that one could understand easily why the
    &quot;native Christian&quot; invariably calls on his deathbed for the minister of his
    original religion.</p>
