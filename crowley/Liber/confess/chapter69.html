    <p>I attended to the production of number five of <em>The Equinox</em>, but shortly after (my diary of
    1911 is missing --- if, indeed, it was ever kept --- so I am uncertain of my dates) I went
    into Retirement, spending my time alternately between Paris and Montigny-sur-Loing on the
    southern edge of the Forest of Fontainebleau. It was immediately evident that I was in the
    right path. I had placed my body and mind entirely at the service of the Master of the
    Temple who had filled the vacuum of the universe caused by the annihilation of Aleister
    Crowley. I kept my body in perfect condition by walking almost every day to Fontainebleau
    and back, always choosing a new way through the forest so that by the end of the summer I
    knew every tree by name, as one might say. I had acquired a boundless love for that
    incomparable woodland, whose glorious beauty is still further hallowed by the romance
    which lurks in every glade. It was tame indeed in comparison with a hundred other jungles
    which I had known, but for all that it possesses an individual charm which endears it to
    me beyond any words of mine to utter. Nature herself opposed no obstacle to my wooing. The
    summer of 1911 was intensely hot and fine. I have always found that dry air is essential
    to the well-being either of my body or of my genius. Damp air seems to interfere with my
    insulation; my genius leaks away and leaves me empty and depressed.</p>
    <p>This year indeed was another <em>annus mirabilis</em> for me. There was an almost
    continual outpouring of the Holy Spirit through my mind. The spring of poetry shot crystal
    clear from the hidden furnace of my being into the pure and brilliant air, and fell and
    fertilized the earth about the sacred hill. A thousand years from now men will still
    gather round in wonder and worship to gaze upon the gorgeous pageant of flowers that glow
    upon the glowing grass and to feast upon the ripe fruits that burden the two great trees
    which tower like pillars for a gateway to my garden --- the tree of the knowledge of Good
    and Evil and the Tree of Life.</p>
    <p>Let me first enumerate the comparatively profane achievements of these few months.
    Firstly, &quot;Across the Gulf</a>&quot;. This is a
    prose story of some twenty thousand words. The theme is my own life in the 26th Dynasty,
    when I was Ankh-f-n-khonsu and brought about the Aeon of Osiris to replace that of Isis.
    The story must not be taken as true in the ordinary sense of the word, but as allegorical.</p>
    <p>I wrote many lyrics, but especially &quot;The Sevenfold Sacrament&quot;. This poem
    subsequently appeared in the <em>English Review</em> and has often been reprinted. It</p>
    <p>{665}</p>
    <p>is, one might say, a pendant to <em>Aha!</em> It
    is one of my finest achievements from a technical point of view and describes the actual
    experience of a night which I spent at Montigny. I was staying at an inn called the Vanne
    Rouge, on the bank of the Loing overlooking a weir. (The inn has since then become
    fashionable and impossible; at that time it was adorable in every way.)</p>
    <blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In eddies of obsidian,<br>
          At my feet the river ran<br>
          Between me and the poppy-pranky<br>
          Isle, with tangled roots embanked,<br>
          Where seven sister poplars stood<br>
          Like the seven sisters of god.</p>
          <p>Soft as silence in mine ear,<br>
          The drone and rustle of the weir<br>
          Told in bass the treble tale<br>
          Of the embowered nightingale.<br>
          Higher, on the patient river,<br>
          Velvet lights without a quiver<br>
          Echoed through their hushed rimes<br>

          Where in cerements of sable,<br>
          One square tower and one great gable<br>
          Stood, the melancholy wraith<br>
          Of a false and fallen faith.<br>
          Over all, supine, enthralling,<br>
          The young moon, her faint edge falling<br>
          To the dead verge of her setting,<br>
          Saintly swam, her silver fretting<br>
          All the leaves with light. Afar<br>

          The luminous eternal witness.</p>

    <p>I described how the silence stripped me of myself; how I came once more into the Abyss

    <p>This experience lasted throughout the night, and I describe the dawn, the awakening of
    the world and myself to what men call reality.</p>

          As the moon consecrates the night.<br>
          Labour is corn and love is wine,<br>
          And both are bless&#130;d in the shrine;<br>
          Nor is he for priest designated.<br>
          Who partakes only in one kind.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I suited the action to the word.</p>
    <p>There was also the poem &quot;A Birthday</a>&quot;,
    written on August 10th for Leila Waddell, who was then twenty-six. She had gone to England
    to fulfil an engagement as leader of the Ladies' Orchestra in <em>The Waltz Dream</em>.
    The poem describes the history of our liaison.</p>
    <p>I wrote also two short stories. The hero of &quot;The
    Woodcutter</a>&quot; is a forester who &quot;chops to live and lives to chop&quot;. A
    silly Frenchman and his mistress are wandering through the forest. He fantastically
    exhorts the woodcutter to make an art of his work, while the girl amuses herself by trying
    to excite the old man's passions. That night there is a thunderstorm; and an English girl,
    who has lost her way, takes refuge in his hut. He combines the element of his thought
    during sleep, chops her to pieces, stacks her limbs neatly by the hut, and goes off to his
    regular work. A rescue party discovers him. The story ends, &quot;They told him of a widow
    lady in Paris who could beat him at his own game.&quot;</p>
    <p>{667}</p>
    <p>I am passionately indignant that the persistent beastliness of the average mind insists
    that the woodcutter violated the girl. Such a suggestion completely ruins the point of the
    story, which is that his mind had room for no idea of any kind except chopping.</p>
    <p>&quot;His Secret Sin</a>&quot; was written on an
    idea given me by Neuburg. I heard afterwards it had already been used by <em>Punch</em>.
    It is admitted, of course, that this kind of plagiarism is allowable.</p>
    <p>A prosperous English grocer is in Paris on business. He wants desperately to be
    &quot;wicked&quot;, but is ashamed to inquire how these things are done. On the last day
    of his stay he is goaded to madness by seeing the statue of Joan of Arc astride a horse.
    He makes up his mind to buy an indecent photograph at least and dives into a shop, where
    he asks for something &quot;tray sho&quot;. The shopman contemptuously produces albums of
    reproductions from the Louvre. When he strikes the Venus of Milo, he secrets it, pays half
    a sovereign in terror and slinks out of the shop. He keeps the photograph in his safe and
    brings it out at night and gloats.</p>
    <p>His daughter is attending art classes; for a colonel and his wife have taken pity on
    her and tried to extricate her from her surroundings. One day she shows him some sketches
    one of which is the Venus of Milo herself. Her father abuses her furiously. She is
    &quot;As bad as Cousin Jenny&quot;. She snatches the drawing, telling him not to touch
    sacred things. His secret sin has been visited on his child. She is perfectly shameless in
    her iniquity! And then it strikes him that no decent art class would use such a model. He
    blurts out, &quot;How did you get the key of my little safe?&quot; She understands the
    whole thing and walks out of the house in disgust, never to return. He, overwhelmed by the
    judgment of God, determines to commit suicide, after burning the accursed photograph. But
    he cannot summon up courage and flings the cocked pistol into the grate. It explodes; the
    bullet destroys one eye and cheek. But he recovers. The street boys take to calling him
    &quot;Old Venus&quot; and his guilty conscience persuades him that they have somehow heard
    the story.</p>
    <p>This tale is one of the most bitter truths that I have penned. I am glad to say that it
    is almost the only evidence of what I felt with regard to the attitude of the English
    bourgeoisie towards art and sex; and, even so, my picture of the younger generation bears
    witness to my unshakable faith in the emancipation of my folk. Indeed, I have not wrought
    in vain. The young men and women of today, generally speaking, are as free from
    superstitions and sexual shame as I would have them. It is only a further proof of this
    that the &quot;old guard&quot; are more desperately narrow and fanatical than ever. They
    are trying to stop drinking, smoking, dancing and reading, by law. Intolerance is evidence
    of impotence.</p>
    <p>I brought off an astounding double event in Paris, probably during August. I was at 50
    rue Vavin and the idea of a dramatic poem or allegory to be</p>
    <p>{668}</p>
    <p>called &quot;Adonis</a>&quot; came into my mind. I
    went out for a <em>citron pressé</em> at the Café do Dôme de Montparnasse, preliminary
    to settling down to write. The argument was almost complete in my mind and the rhythm was
    beginning to flow through me. But at the Dôme were sitting my old mistress, Nina Olivier,
    and her latest conquest, an unpleasant and cadaverous hypocrite named Hener-Skene, whom I
    knew slightly from 1902, when he was posing as an earnest Nietzchian. With them was
    sitting a charming girl named (or calling herself Fenella Lovell, a consumptive creature
    in gaudy and fantastic rags of brilliant colours, who earned her living partly as a model,
    partly as a &quot;gypsy&quot; fiddle and dancer.</p>
    <p>Skene and Nina had taken advantage of her sickness and poverty to amuse themselves by
    whipping and otherwise ill-treating her. It was not honest sadism on Skene's part; it was
    a pose. He thought it very glorious to be a character in Krafft-Ebing. They asked me to
    drink and introduced me to Fenella. Her pathetic beauty set me suddenly aflame with an
    idea to make her the heroine of a little play. My mind was swept clean of
    &quot;Adonis&quot;. Then minutes later I was back in my room, furiously at work on &quot;The Ghouls</a>&quot;.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>The Ghouls</em> is possibly the most ghastly death-dance in English literature. If
      Oscar Wilde had written it (but he could not have) everyone would know it. It is the very
      pith and marrow of terror. Cynical it may be, but I defy the lord of dreams to send any
      more plutonian nightmare to haunt our mortal sleep.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This criticism (from the <em>Poetry Review</em>) fills me with honest pride.</p>
    <p>I finished the play during the night and instantly picked up the idea of
    &quot;Adonis&quot;, which by an unparalleled <em>tour de force</em> I had kept intact at
    the back of my mind. I finished this play also straight off. The most remarkable point of
    this most remarkable achievement is that no two plays could have been more dissimilar,
    either in theme or style. &quot;The Ghouls</a>&quot; is
    prose, save for one short song, and ranges from the loftiest sublimity to dialect and
    slang. &quot;Adonis&quot; is poetry, mystic, sensuous and comic by turn; much of it
    written in the elaborate and exquisite method of closely woven rimes which I myself
    invented.</p>
    <p>Later in the summer, I set to work on a really large idea, a play of Old Venice in five
    acts. I kept my two main principles of composition; the use of colour and form to
    distinguish my characters and compose a visible symphony.</p>
    <p align="center">MORTADELLO</p>
    <p><em>The Doge</em> has white hair, and is seventy years of age.<br>
    <em>Mortadello</em> has hair died dark auburn, and forty years of age. He is stout, tall
    and pompous.</p>
    <p>{669}</p>
    <p><em>Alessandro</em> has rough hair of fiery red and is thirty years of age.<br>
    <em>Lorenzo</em> has scanty ashen hair, and is twenty-eight years of age.<br>
    <em>Gabriele</em> is a hunchbacked dwarf, very strongly built, with a large and
    intellectual head. He is bald, and is fifty years of age.<br>
    <em>Orlando</em> is of a gigantic stature, a full Negro. He is forty years of age.<br>
    <em>The Legate</em> is an old and venerable man of ascetic and noble type.<br>
    <em>Magdalena</em> is a tall, robust and buxom woman of thirty-five years old.<br>
    Her hair is black, but her complexion pale.<br>
    <em>Lucrezia</em> is a tall, robust and buxom woman of thirty-five years old.<br>
    Her hair is of fine gold, her eyes of pale blue and her complexion fair and rosy.<br>
    <em>Zelina</em> is small and plump. her hair is brown, and her age nine and twenty, though
    she looks older.<br>
    <em>Monica</em> is of medium height, very thin and serpent-like, her hair black and crisp;
    her features like Madonna's. Her eyes are extraordinarily black, keen and piercing. Her
    age is twenty. Her hands and feet are very small and white, her complexion like fine
    porcelain.<br>
    <em>The Abbess</em> is a gigantic and burly woman of fifty years old.</p>
    <p>My other principle of internal rimes I made more difficult for myself than ever, by
    sticking throughout to the Alexandrine. No English writer has previously attempted to use
    this magnificent verse, no doubt, in part, because of the danger of monotony. This I
    avoided by introducing my internal rime at all parts of the line.</p>
    <p>I quote from my own explanation.</p>
    <p>1. <em>The Classical:</em><br>
    Ay, to this end, indeed was marriage first or<em>dained</em>,<br>
    And to this end today is by the Church sus<em>tained</em>.<br>
    2. <em>Idem, marked by a rime:</em><br>
    Listen; in all good &quot;faith&quot;, I gladly grant you <em>much</em>,<br>
    Not prone to scoff, and <em>scathe</em> the scutcheon with a <em>smutch</em>.</p>
    <p>3. <em>After the second foot:</em></p>
    <p>Oh! but you're <em>hurt</em>!<br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">........................</font>Young man! she shall be tended,<br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">........................................................................</font><em>Well</em>.<br>
    No! take my <em>shirt</em>! Staunch the dear beast.<br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">............................................................</font>A
    mira<em>cle</em>.</p>
    <p>4. <em>After the fourth foot:</em><br>
    Serene, august, untroubled, <em>cold</em>, her prayers are <em>worth</em><br>
    More than our steel, more than our <em>gold</em>, that bind the <em>earth</em>.</p>
    <p>5. <em>After the first foot:</em><br>
    Bow <em>down</em> to the Cross! His love purge thee! His Passion <em>save thee</em>!</p>
    <p>{670}</p>
    <p>Christ <em>crown</em> the work! Here is the blessing that He <em>gave thee</em>.<br>
    6. <em>After both second and fourth feet:</em><br>
    Come, let me <em>hold</em> my crystal <em>cross</em> up to the <em>moon</em>!<br>
    A guess of <em>gold</em> were at a <em>loss</em> to tell its <em>tune</em>.<br>
    7. <em>After the first and fifth feet:</em><br>
    No <em>news</em>! No word of Mortadello's <em>fate</em>! No <em>hope</em><br>
    To <em>bruise</em> the head of the old snake, the <em>State</em>. No <em>scope</em>.<br>
    8. <em>After the first half foot and the second foot:</em><br>
    <em>Come</em>, save me, <em>save</em> Thy Maiden! Strike each barbed <em>dart</em><br>
    <em>Home</em> to the <em>grave</em> convent and cloister of my <em>heart</em>.</p>
    <p>9. <em>After the fifth foot:</em><br>
    Last, to the lords who by their atti<em>tude applaud</em><br>
    This day of burial to faction, <em>feud</em> and <em>fraud</em>.</p>
    <p>10. <em>After the second and fourth feet, but each line rimed within itself:</em></p>
    <p>Of for the <em>blind</em> kiss of the <em>wind</em>, the desert <em>air</em><br>
    Thrilling the <em>blue</em> and shrilling <em>through</em> my soul's desp<em>air</em>.<br>
    (&quot;Thrilling&quot; and &quot;shrilling&quot; are here thrown in without extra charge.
    This device frequently recurs.)</p>
    <p>There may be one or two other complications which I have over-looked.</p>
    <p>I have made use of the usual liberties in the matter of using anapests and trochees for
    iambics. With regard to double rimes, I have sometimes treated them as single rimes, when
    they occur in the middle of a line; sometimes I have made the line of thirteen syllables
    to suit them.</p>
    <p>I have even, once or twice, used the reverse method of calling a pause a half foot.
    &quot;Stare, murderer, stare&quot; counts as six syllables.</p>
    <p>All this has been done of high purpose; there is some inflection or emphasis to be
    gained, or some tone to be given to the speech by the irregularity.</p>
    <p>The argument of the play is simple. Monica aims at becoming the autocrat of Venice and
    succeeds. In each scene is a definite action of the highest pictorial, as well as
    dramatic, value that I could imagine. The play is full of violent scenes of love and
    murder. I believe that I have used three ideas entirely new in drama.</p>
    <p>1. Monica has caused her Negro lover to murder the daughter of the Doge, till then his
    mistress. She bids him retrieve the corpse from the canal, where he had thrown it. The
    crime is concealed and the dead woman is hidden as the guest of Monica. She dresses up the
    corpse and has it married to Mortadello in St. Mark's</p>
    <p>2. Monica, cornered in a crypt, is praying passionately while her Negro lover is slain
    by their enemies. Her hysteria produces the stigmata; and this apparent proof of her
    sanctity overcomes the assailants, whose leader she</p>
    <p>{671}</p>
    <p>touches with the tip of a poisoned crucifix. He dies on the spot; his followers wish to
    fall at her feet, but she insists on being arrested.</p>
    <p>3. Having forced Mortadello to marry her, she disguises herself as a Saharan dancer and
    drugs him with hashish. She then discloses her identity; and he, in the madness of the
    drug, attacks the Papal legate. She follows and, defending the old man, kills her husband.
    This last scene, by the way, fulfils my idea of true comedy; the dressing up of a man as a
    king or god, and inducing him to preside at a hunting of which he is in reality to be the
    quarry. I have shown in my essay &quot;Good Hunting!&quot; (<em>The International</em>,
    March 1918) that this central idea is universal in all the best comedy and tragedy from
    the &quot;Bacchae&quot; of Euripides, the story of Esther, the Crucifixion and the murder
    of Hiram Abif, to the plays of Shakespeare, Ibsen and many others.</p>
    <p>I now turn to my magical writings during this astounding summer.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I began to make a list of Greek words connected with Magick and
    similar subjects, arranging them by their numerical order. The idea was to construct a
    dictionary of the Greek Cabbala<strong>1</strong> similar to that of the Hebrew Cabbala on
    which I had been at work since 1899 and ultimately published in <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, No. VIII. But the Greek Cabbala presents
    difficulties which do not arise in the case of Hebrew. First, we have no sacred text in
    Greek save a few imperfect and most unsatisfactory gnostic documents<strong>2</strong>,
    the hopelessly garbled Apocalypse and a few oddments like the Emerald Table of Hermes, the
    Divine Pymander and the Golden Verses of Pythagoras. Secondly, the various dialects of
    Greek affect the computations and there is no means of choosing between them. Thirdly, the
    terminations alter the values. It is even difficult to decide whether or no to reckon the
    article. Fourthly, the actual examples of Cabbala existent are shamefully unconscientious,
    as may be seen by reference to Messrs Lea and Bond's brochure. The equate words and
    phrases quite arbitrarily. If it suits them to count the article they count it.</p>
    <p>That this Cabbala exists is nevertheless certain. The correspondences in the Apocalypse
    in connection with the series 111 to 999 is undeniably intentional. Nor can it be an
    accident that Mithras (360) was altered to Meithras (365) to suit the correction of the
    calendar. The matter is of extreme importance; because Aiwass in dictating <em>The Book of
    the Law</em> repeatedly makes use of correspondences in Greek, such as Thelema, Will, 93
    --- Agape, Love, 93. 718 = Stele 666, and so on. He also equates Greek and Hebrew words.
    Thus his own name spelt in Hebrew has the value 93, but in Greek that of 418, thus
    bringing into relation the Word of the Law of the Aeon with the Magical Formula of the
    Great Work. My preliminary studies, however, tended to discourage me, for the fourfold
    reason above stated; and the proposed dictionary remains uncompleted to this day.</p>
    <p>During this summer I wrote no less than nineteen books of magical and<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: This was to be published as &quot;Liber MCCLXIV&quot;, but
        despite being cited in &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot; it was not published in
        Crowley's lifetime. The first publication came in the May 1979 e.v. issue of &quot;The
        O.T.O. Newsletter&quot;, pp. 9 to 44. Unfortunately, when I edited the material together
        for that publication, I discovered that the most interesting entries had been lost.
        Crowley kept the Greek Cabbala on slips of paper in a cigar box. Apparently, whenever he
        wanted to use some entry for his various writings, he fished out a slip from the box. It
        would appear that he failed to replace most of the slips so extracted. A search of his
        works will restore many of the missing entries.<br>

    <p>mystical instruction. Each is characterized by the simplest, sublimest and most
    concentrated prose of which I was master. The sceptical attitude is rigorously preserved;
    and, with the instructions already issued and a few minor matters to which I attend later,
    they comprise an absolutely comprehensive practical guide to every branch of the technique
    of spiritual attainment. The methods of every country, creed and clime, stripped of their
    dogma and prejudice, are here presented scientifically and simply. Besides these, there
    may be found certain methods prescribed in <em>The Book of the Law</em> or invented by
    myself. I will give a short synopsis of these nineteen Instructions.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER I</em>.
    The Book of the Magus.</p>
    <p>This is an inspired writing. It describes the conditions of that exalted Grade. I had
    at this time no idea that I should ever attain to it; in fact, I thought it utterly beyond
    possibility. This book was given to me that I might avoid mistakes when the time came for
    me to become a Magus. It is impossible to give any idea of the terror and sublimity of
    this book, while the accuracy of its predictions and of its descriptions of the state of
    being, at that time wholly beyond my imagination to conceive, make it a most astonishing
    document.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER X</em>.
    This book is called &quot;The Gate of Light&quot;. It explains how those who have attained
    initiation, taking pity upon the darkness and minuteness of the earth, send forth a
    messenger to men. The message follows. It is an appeal to those who, being developed
    beyond the average of their fellows, see fit to take up the Great Work. This Work is then
    described in general terms with a few hints of its conditions.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER XI</em>
    is a paraphrase of the instructions given in <em>The Book of the Law</em> for invoking
    Nuit.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER XVI</em>,
    called &quot;The Tower; or the House of God&quot;, describes a series of meditation
    practices, the general method being to destroy every thought that tends to arise in the
    mind by an act of will. The thought must be nipped in the bud before it reaches
    consciousness. Further, the causes which tend to produce any such thought must be
    discovered and annihilated. Finally, this process must be extended to include the original
    cause behind those causes.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    LXIV</em> gives instruction in a method of summoning suitable persons to undertake the
    Great Work. It includes a powerful invocation of the god of Truth, Wisdom and Magick.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    LXVI</em>. The Book of the Ruby Star describes an extremely powerful ritual of
    practical Magick; how to arouse the Magical Force within the operator and how to use it to
    create whatever may be required.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    XC</em>. The Book of the Hermetic Fish-Hook summons mankind to undertake the Great
    Work. It describes the conditions of initiation and its results in language of great
    poetic power.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CLVI</em>. The Wall of Abiegnus (the Sacred Mountain of the Rosicrucians) gives the
    formula of Attainment by devotion to our Lady</p>
    <p>{673}</p>
    <p>Babalon. It instructs the aspirant how to dissolve his personality in the Universal
    Life.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CLXXV</em>. Astarte, The Book of the Beryl Stone, gives the complete formula of
    Bhaki-Yoga; how one may unite oneself to any particular deity by devotion. Both magical
    and mystical methods are fully described.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER CC</em>.
    The Book of the Sun. Here are given the four Adorations to the sun, to be said daily at
    dawn, noon, sunset and midnight. The object of this practice is firstly to remind the
    aspirant at regular intervals of the Great Work; secondly, to bring him into conscious
    personal relation with the centre of our system; and thirdly, for advanced students, to
    make actual magical contact with the spiritual energy of the sun and thus to draw actual
    force from him.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CCVI</em>. The Book of Breathing describes various practices of controlling the
    breath, how to ensure success, what results to strive for, and how to use them for the
    Great Work.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CCXXXI</em> is a technical treatise on the Tarot. The sequence of the 22 Trumps is
    explained as a formula of initiation.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CCCLXX</em>, The Book of Creation or of the Goat of the Spirit, analyses the nature of
    the creative magical force in man, explains how to awaken it, how to use it and indicates
    the general as well as the particular objects to be gained thereby.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CD</em> analyses the Hebrew alphabet into seven triads, each of which forms a Trinity
    of sympathetic ideas relating respectively to the Three Orders comprised in the A.'. A.'..
    It is really an attempt to find a Periodic Law in the system.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CDLXXIV</em>. The Book of the Mouth of the Abyss or of Knowledge. A course of study in
    philosophy is prescribed as a preliminary. The aspirant having assimilated all existing
    systems, he is instructed how to analyse the nature of the reason itself and thus how to
    cross the Abyss on the Intellectual Plane. Having cleansed and renewed his mental
    faculties in this way, he resumes his aspiration to the Knowledge and Conversation of His
    Holy Guardian Angel, with whose reappearance he perfects his Magical Powers so that he is
    ready to undertake the Work of annihilating the universe, which, being done, he becomes a
    full Master of the Temple.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    DLV</em>. This is a paraphrase of the instructions given in <em>The book of the Law</em>
    for attaining Hadit.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    DCCCXXXI</em>, The Book of Vesta. This book describes three main methods of reducing
    the multiplicity of thoughts to one. (The magical method is to banish ceremonially the 32
    parts of the universe in turn. One mystical method is to deny in consciousness that any
    part of the body or mind is real. Another is to stimulate the senses in turn with such
    concentration as to put it out of gear.)</p>
    <p>{674}</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    DCCCLXVIII</em>. This is an analysis of the 22 letters. To each is attributed a
    magical or mystical practice of progressive difficulty until attainment is complete.</p>
    <p><em>LIBER
    CMXIII</em>. The Book of the Memory of the Path. Here are given two methods of
    acquiring the Magical Memory so as to enable the aspirant to calculate his True Orbit in
    eternity. The first method is to learn to think backwards till he acquires the power of
    recalling the events of his life in reverse chronological order. The idea is to get back
    beyond one's birth to one's previous death, and so on for many lives. It should then be
    easy to understand the general object of one's existence. The second (easier and surer)
    method is to consider every event in one's past, determine the influence which each has
    had upon one's life, and by synthesizing these forces, calculate their resultant; that is
    determine one's general direction so as to be able to concentrate one's energies on
    fulfilling the function for which one is fit. Character, conduct an circumstances are to
    be considered as terms of a complex dynamic equation. This method is of extreme value to
    all. It should be applied even to the education of children so as not to force them into
    unnatural developments.</p>
    <p>These nineteen books were published in numbers six and seven of <em>The Equinox</em>.
    During this summer, I also prepared the extremely important account of the circumstances
    in which the stele was discovered and <em>The Book of the Law</em> written, for number
    seven. In this manner I published a facsimile of the manuscript of that Book and my
    Comment thereon. This latter is shamefully meagre and incomplete. The truth is, that
    despite everything, I still felt an indescribable repugnance. I knew well how unworthy the
    Comment was as it stood, yet I could not force myself to work on it, partly, no doubt,
    because I felt, as indeed I feel now, that nothing I can write can possibly be worthy of
    or adequate to the text; but partly also, from an instinctive fear and dislike of the
    subject.</p>
    <p>And so passed away this superb summer. The autumn had a new experience in store for me.
    The current of my life was once more to be suddenly turned; and as usual, this critical
    change came about as the result of a series of casual chances. I was caught in a web, some
    of whose strands had been woven as early as 1902. I must deal with this new development in
    a new chapter.</p>
