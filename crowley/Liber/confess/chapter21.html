    <p>Allan Bennett</a> was four years older than myself.
    His father, an engineer, had died when he was a boy; his mother had brought him up as a
    strict Catholic. He suffered acutely from spasmodic asthma. His cycle of life was to take
    opium for about a month, when the effect wore off, so that he had to inject morphine.
    After a month of this he had to switch to cocaine, which he took till he began to
    &quot;see things&quot; and was then reduced to chloroform. I have seen him in bed for a
    week, only recovering consciousness sufficiently to reach for the bottle and sponge.
    Asthma being a sthenic disease, he was then too weak to have it any more, so he would
    gradually convalesce until, after a few weeks of freedom, the spasms would begin once more
    and he would be forced to renew the cycle of drugs<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>No doubt, this constant suffering affected his attitude to life. He revolted against
    being an animal; he regarded the pleasures of living (and above all, those of physical
    love) as diabolical illusions devised by the enemy of mankind in order to trick souls into
    accepting the curse of existence. I cannot forbear quoting one most remarkable incident.
    When he was about sixteen, the conversation in the laboratory where he was working turned
    upon childbirth. What he heard disgusted him. He became furiously angry and said that
    children were brought to earth by angels. The other students laughed at him and tried in
    vain to convince him. He maintained their theory to be a bestial blasphemy. The next day
    one of the boys turned up with an illustrated manual of obstetrics. He could no longer
    doubt the facts. But his reaction was this: &quot;Did the Omnipotent God whom he had been
    taught to worship devise so revolting and degrading a method of perpetuating the species?
    Then this God must be a devil, delighting in loathsomeness.&quot; To him the existence of
    God was disproved from that moment.</p>
    <p>He had, however, already some experience of an unseen world. As a little boy, having
    overheard some gossip among superstitious servants, he had gone into the back garden and
    invoked the devil by reciting the Lord's Prayer backwards. Something happened which
    frightened him.</p>
    <p>Having now rejected Catholicism, he took up Magick and at once attained extraordinary
    success. He used to carry a &quot;lustre&quot; --- a long glass prism with a neck and a
    pointed knob such as adorned old-fashioned chandeliers. He used this as a wand. One day, a
    party of theosophists were chatting sceptically about the power of the &quot;blasting
    rod&quot;. Allan promptly produced his and blasted one of them. It took fourteen hours to
    restore the incredulous individual to the use of his mind and his muscles.<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: The modern reader should not be too much disturbed by this
        catalogue of patently illegal drugs. They were all legal until well into the 20th century.
        This approach to asthma was still followed in the last quarter of the 20th century, with
        various dangerous medications prescribed in rotation by physicians for the patient to the
        point of sequential toxic reaction. Crowley himself became afflicted with the disorder,
        almost &quot;the Magician's disease&quot; for its frequency among those who follow this
        interest. Crowley's doctor prescribed heroin at a time in the 'teens when it was thought
        to be non-addictive! Crowley experienced the terrors of withdrawal, recounted in his
        &quot;Liber XCIII</a>&quot;, and ultimately died of
        respiratory infection in 1947, fifty years after the events described here.</font></li>

    <p>Allan Bennett</a> was tall, but his sickness had
    already produced a stoop. His head, crowned with a shock of wild black hair, was intensely
    noble; the brows, both wide and lofty, overhung indomitable piercing eyes. The face would
    have been handsome had it not been for the haggardness and pallour due to his almost
    continuous suffering.</p>
    <p>Despite his ill-health, he was a tremendous worker. His knowledge of science,
    especially electricity, was vast, accurate and profound. In addition, he had studied the
    Hindu and Buddhist scriptures, not only as a scholar, but with the insight that comes from
    inborn sympathetic understanding.</p>
    <p>I did not fully realize the colossal stature of that sacred spirit; but I was instantly
    aware that this man could teach me more in a month than anyone else in five years. He was
    living in great discomfort and penury. I offered him the hospitality of my flat. I have
    always felt that since the occult sciences nourish so many charlatans, it should be one's
    prime point of honour not to make money in any way connected with them<strong>1</strong>.
    The amateur status above all! Hospitality is, however, always allowable. But I was careful
    never to go beyond the strict letter of the word.</p>
    <p>Iehi Aour came to stay with me and under his tuition I made rapid progress. He showed
    me where to get knowledge, how to criticize it and how to apply it. We also worked
    together at ceremonial Magick; evoking spirits, consecrating talismans, and so on.</p>
    <p>I must relate one episode, as throwing light upon my magical accomplishments and my
    ethical standards. Jones and I had come to the conclusion that Allan</a> would die unless he went to live in a warmer
    climate. However, he was penniless and we would not finance him for the reasons given
    above. Instead, Jones and I evoked to visible appearance the spirit Buer, of <em>The
    Goetia</em>, whose function is to heal the sick. We were partially successful; a helmeted
    head and the left leg being distinctly solid, though the rest of the figure was cloudy and
    vague. But the operation was in fact a success in the following manner. It is instructive
    to narrate this as showing the indirect and natural means by which the will attains its
    object.</p>
    <p>I am constrained to a seeming digression. Many authors insist on the importance of
    absolute chastity in the aspirant. For some months I had been disregarding this injunction
    with a seductive siren whose husband was a colonel in India. Little by little I overcame
    my passion for her and we parted. She wrote to me frequently and tried to shake my
    resolution, but I stood firm. Shortly after the evocation of Buer, she wrote, begging me
    to call at her hotel. I cannot remember how it came into my mind to to what I did, but I
    went to see her. She begged me to come back to her and offered to do anything I wanted. I
    said to her, &quot;You're making a mess of your life by your selfishness. I will give you
    a chance to do an absolutely unfettered act. Give me a hundred pounds, I won't tell you
    whom it's for, except that it's</p>
    <p>{181}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Notwithstanding this and a more extreme diatribe against
        &quot;Black Magic&quot; in his &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;, Crowley did
        accept remuneration for doing Astrological charts at a later period than this writing. In
        other instances he did dedicate his income from mystical and magical writings to the
        support of his O.T.O. and not his personal needs.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>not for myself. I have private reasons for not using my own money in this matter. If
    you give me this, it must be without hoping or expecting anything in return.&quot; She
    gave me the money --- it paid Allan's passage to Ceylon and saved to humanity one of the
    most valuable lives of our generation.</p>
    <p>So much for Buer. As for the lady, she came to see me some time later and I saw that I
    was myself acting selfishly in setting my spiritual welfare above her happiness. She had
    made a generous gesture; I could do no less. She agreed not to stand in the way of my
    performing the Operation of <em>Abra-Melin</em>, but begged me to give her a living memory
    of our love. I agreed and the sequel will be told in its place.</p>
    <p>During this time, magical phenomena were of constant occurrence. I had two temples in
    my flat; one white, the walls being lined with six huge mirrors, each six feet by eight;
    the other black<strong>1</strong>, a mere cupboard, in which stood an altar supported by
    the figure of a Negro standing on his hands. The presiding genius of this place was a
    human skeleton, which I fed from time to time with blood, small birds and the like. The
    idea was to give it life, but I never got further than causing the bones to become covered
    with a viscous slime<strong>2</strong>. In <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, no. 1 is a story,
    &quot;At the Fork of the Roads</a>&quot;, which is in
    every detail a true account of one episode of this period. Will Bute is W. B, Yeats<strong>3</strong>,
    Hypatia Gay is Althoea Gyles, the publisher is Leonard Smithers.</p>
    <p>The demons connected with <em>Abra-Melin</em> do not wait to be evoked; they come
    unsought. One night Jones and I went out to dinner. I noticed on leaving the white temple
    that the latch of its Yale lock had not caught. Accordingly, I pulled the door to and
    tested it. As we went out, we noticed semi-solid shadows on the stairs; the whole
    atmosphere was vibrating with the forces which we had been using. (We were trying to
    condense them into sensible images.) When we came back, nothing had been disturbed in the
    flat; but the temple door was wide open, the furniture disarranged and some of the symbols
    flung about in the room. We restored order and then observed that semi-materialized beings
    were marching around the main room in almost unending procession.</p>
    <p>When I finally left the flat for Scotland, it was found that the mirrors were too big
    to take out except by way of the black temple. This had, or course, been completely
    dismantled before the workmen arrived. But the atmosphere remained and two of them were
    put out of action for several hours. It was almost a weekly experience, by the way, to
    hear of casual callers fainting or being seized with dizziness, cramp or apoplexy on the
    stair case. It was a long time before those rooms were re-let. People felt</p>
    <p>{182}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Iehi Aour never had anything to do with this; and I but little: the
        object of establishing it was probably to satisfy my instinct about equilibrium.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: In an action Crowley brought for libel in 1934, he testified
        under oath on the particulars of this set of temples; see &quot;The Magical Link&quot;,
        Sept./Oct. 1988, a members' publication of O.T.O., for an excerpt of the trial transcript.
        On the point of feeding skeletons, mine likes beer. Crowley had an aversion to beer and
        probably never tried it. I just pore a little on a fossil dinosaur bone at her feet now
        and then, and she firms up nicely. They also like jewelry.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">The identification is conjectural, depending solely on the admissions of
        Miss Gyles.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>instinctively the presence of something uncanny. Similarly, later on, when I gave up my
    rooms in Victoria Street, a pushing charlatan thought to better himself by taking them.
    With this object he went to see them. A few seconds later he was leaping headlong down the
    five flights of stairs, screaming in terror. He had just sufficient genuine sensitiveness
    to feel the forces, without possessing the knowledge, courage and will required to turn
    them to account, or even to endure their impact.<hr>
