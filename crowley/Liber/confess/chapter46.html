    <p>So we stole out in the dim grey of the morning. I remember her furtive passage under
    his window, and how I murmured</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Wake Duncan with thy knocking?<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>I would thou could'st</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>recalling --- too late! --- the theatrical superstition that it is very unlucky to
    quote <em>Macbeth</em> at the beginning of an enterprise.</p>
    <p>We jogged along in the little train in a state of curious constraint. Of course our
    relations &quot;were&quot; rather peculiar, when all was said and done. Anyhow, there was
    nothing to say. Rose was a charming woman, but far from an intellectual companion. Her
    brother's friends being for the most part addicted to art or literature, it was her custom
    to carry a volume of Browning in her dressing-case, and she would ask people to fetch it
    for her, which impressed them. She didn't have to read it. Again, whenever a conversation
    flagged, she would remark thoughtfully:</p>
    <p align="center">Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art!</p>
    <p>&quot;Twas all she knew. However, I wasn't going to have to live with her. All I had to
    do was to emancipate her. So there was no reason for trying to talk to her.</p>
    <p>We reached Dingwall in the clod damp dawn; we disinterred the sheriff's address from a
    sleepy policeman and arrived at his house only to be told by a dishevelled maid that we
    couldn't get at him till eight or nine or ten o'clock. I was piqued. The hint of obstacles
    roused me. I wasn't going to elope, whatever my reasons might be, and make a mess of it. I
    demanded the address of a lawyer and excavated him. He promised to be at his office at
    eight o'clock. With that we had to be content. There was no reason for apprehension. It
    wasn't likely that our disappearance would be discovered until breakfast time. We repaired
    to the hotel and ate and drank something in a state of suppressed nervous excitement. I
    confess to having been ashamed of myself. There I was, accoutred cap-a-pie from my bonnet
    to my claymore, and I had nothing at stake; and yet I was nervous! We were at the lawyer's
    on the stroke of eight, where we discovered that the sheriff was a mere flourish and that
    all we had to do was to consent to being married, and declare that we regarded ourselves
    as man and wife. A faint disgust at the prose of the proceedings induced me to elaborate
    them by taking out</p>
    <p>{366}</p>
    <p>my dirk and kissing it, as a pledge of my faith. I never thought of kissing <em>her</em>!</p>
    <p>It then transpired that the sheriff had to have his little whack, after all, no less
    than an Armenian pimp. The marriage had to be registered in his office. We were completely
    at a loose end. I was to go back to Boleskine, of course, but there were some hours before
    the train started. She was to go back to Strathpeffer: but --- at this moment, Gerald
    Kelly burst into the room, his pale face drawn with insane passion. He was probably
    annoyed at his stupidity in not having realized that the announcement of our engagement,
    nineteen hours earlier, had been serious. On learning that we were already married, he
    aimed a violent blow at me. It missed me by about a yard. I am ashamed to say that I could
    not repress a quiet smile. If he had not been out of his mind, his action would have been
    truly courageous, for compared with me he was a shrimp; and while I was one of the most
    athletic men in the country, his strength had been impaired by his sedentary stupor and
    loose living in Paris.</p>
    <p>When he felt better, we decided to carry out the original programme. I went off to
    Boleskine and she went back to Strathpeffer. I have frequently noticed that interference
    with my plans ensures their being carried out with exactitude.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, however, Mr. Hill had arrived, panting like a parsnip robbed of its
    prey. He bleated out, after a brief invocation to the Woolsack, that the marriage was
    illegal and must be broken. Also may, might, would, could, should, and other auxiliary
    verbs. I yawned gracefully and left them to fight it out.</p>
    <p>Rose stuck to her guns like the game little bitch she was. Mr. Hill made the discovery
    that he had not made the law, and Mrs. Kelly and Gerald that they had not make mankind. So
    the next move in the game was that I dispatched Ludovic Cameron as ambassador. It was the
    supreme moment in his life! I was rather annoyed at being dragged into such crazy
    controversy and heartily wished to hear no more of the matter, but i had to dree my weird.</p>
    <p>It was arranged that Rose and I should go to the sheriff and register our marriage, as
    we risked fine and imprisonment if we omitted to do so. We were then to drive together to
    a wayside station, where we could take our own decision as to our future proceedings.
    Dingwall and Strathpeffer were of course seething with scandal. There were probably as
    many separate stories as there were inhabitants; and the appearance of the laird and his
    bride on the platform of Dingwall might have been the signal for a demonstration to
    eclipse the diamond jubilee and the relief of Mafeking.</p>
    <p>So I returned to Strathpeffer, annoyed but amiable, had an interview with Mrs. Kelly,
    who played the part of the Agèd Queen Bent Down By Sorrow to admiration, while I said all
    the necessary nonsense. We then repaired to</p>
    <p>{367}</p>
    <p>the sheriff's and were induced to swear the most formidable oaths; about nothing in
    particular, but they apparently gratified the official instinct and filled the official
    coffer. Duncombe Jewell excelled himself. The ordinary oath was not for him. He produced a
    formula the majesty of which literally inhibited the normal functions of our minds. It was
    the finest piece of ritualistic rigmarole that I have ever heard in my life.</p>
    <p>At the sheriff's door we found the vehicle which was to take us to the wayside station.
    Rose and I got in, feeling as if we had been through a mangle; but the sense of humour
    came most opportunely to our rescue. The vehicle chanced to resemble a prison van, and the
    circumstance tickled our imagination and helped to break down our embarrassment. But it
    was a frightfully long drive to the wayside station and a frightfully long wait when we
    got there. I don't know whether it was part of the arrangement or not that we should take
    tickets to the end of the line, some place on the west coast of Scotland, the name of
    which I have entirely forgotten. But we did. We sat opposite to each other in an empty
    first-class carriage.</p>
    <p>I only remember on scrap of conversation, and I do not remember what it was except that
    it was a sort of little joke. We were enjoying a species of triumph at having &quot;got
    away with it&quot;, but we were in exquisite embarrassment as to what to do --- at least,
    I was. I have reasoned to suspect that Rose did not share my pathetic puerility. It never
    occurred to me that the programme I had planned had been in any way altered. Had we not
    carried it out with the most punctilious precision?</p>
    <p>We arrived at our destination a little before dinner time. My embarrassment reached an
    acute point. It was simply impossible for me to register at the hotel. I confess to the
    most abject cowardice. I made some excuse and left Rose to confront a clerk, while I went
    to look at the sea and wish ti weren't too cold to drown myself. I returned to find that
    she had booked a double room. I thought it was hardly playing the game; but I couldn't be
    rude to a lady and, at the worst, it was only a matter of a day or so. I could decently
    dispatch her from Boleskine to the embraces of Mr. Summers and proceed to</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Raze out the written troubles of the brain,<br>
        And with some sweet oblivious antidote<br>
        Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It possibly crossed my mind that all these alarums and excursions were alien to
    arahatship, that marriage was a nuisance to a man whose mind was set on success in
    Mahasatipatthana, and that the problems raised by Rose would be sent to sleep by
    Red-headed Arabella.</p>
    <p>In any case, there was nothing for it but to behave like a gentleman. So we drank a lot
    of champagne for dinner. We had been married on August</p>
    <p>{368}</p>
    <p>12th and could give God glory for his good gift of grouse, and then --- What's
    champagne for, anyhow? Rose retired immediately after dinner; I sat in the smoking-room
    and pole-axed a stranger by making mysterious remarks until he thought I was mad, and
    fled. I had some more champagne and remembered that I was a poet. I got some paper and
    wrote the following rondel. Damn it, I had to play up to my partner!</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Rose on the breast of the world of spring,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>I press my breast against thy bloom;<br>
          My subtle life drawn out to thee; to thee<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>its moods and meaning cling.<br>
          I pass from change and thought to peace,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>woven on love's incredible loom,<br>
          Rose on the breast of the world of spring!</p>

          How shall the ecstasy of light fall back to<br>

          No man shall know. I bear thee down unto<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>the tomb, beyond the tomb,<br>
          Rose on the breast of the world of spring!</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I went upstairs.</p>
    <p>I began to suspect the truth, that my absolute indifference to rose, combined with my
    perfectly casual willingness to marry her in order to do her a service, as one might offer
    a stranger one's place in an omnibus, had purged her heart of its passion for the fat
    sensuality of Frank Summers, and hurled her head over heels in love with me.</p>
    <p>We arrived at Boleskine, where I learnt that Red-headed Arabella was due to arrive at
    Inverness the following day. I blush to say that I didn't know quite what to do about it,
    and confided in Duncombe Jewell. He rose to the occasion and went to Inverness to head her
    off. It may seem incredible; but my reaction was on of sheer annoyance. I had no feeling
    for Red-headed Arabella; in point of fact, I had picked her for that very reason, and I
    was perfectly ready to relive Rose from the tyranny of her family. But it was really
    asking rather too much when I had to upset my arrangements. I had</p>
    <p>{369}</p>
    <p>not even yet suspected the truth that the fine flight of Rose's rapture was carrying me
    away on its wings. Her love for me was evoking my live for her, and I had rather made a
    point of contracting out of any such complications. I was prepared to propitiate
    physiology, but only on condition that the domain of psychology suffered no interference.</p>
    <p>However, there I was, married to one of the most beautiful and fascinating women in the
    world. The love between us grew to the utmost possibilities of passion without my
    suspecting it. The Kellys had acquiesced in the fait accompli. The last little splutter
    was a letter from the Rev. Frederick Festus demanding that I should settle ten thousand
    pounds on Rose. I might have done so had it not been for his pompous statement that the
    daughters of his house never married without a settlement. Considering that the very one
    whom I married myself had had no settlement at her first marriage, the lie was a little
    blatant, even for a clergyman. I replied with appropriate decision; they abandoned the
    idea that I could be bullied, as they were accustomed to bully timid and servile people
    who could be bounced. I have never understood the quality of bluster with which some
    people seem to get right through the world. It must be so humiliating to be
    &quot;called&quot;. I much prefer to put forward my weakness to induce the attack of the
    malicious, while I am lying in ambush with an overwhelming reinforcement.</p>
    <p>The honeymoon was uninterrupted beatitude. Once, in the first three weeks or so, Rose
    took some trifling liberty; I recognized the symptoms, and turned her up and spanked her.
    She henceforth added the qualities of perfect wife to those of perfect mistress. Women,
    like all moral inferiors, behave well only when treated with firmness, kindness and
    justice. They are always on the look-out to detect wavering or irritation in the master;
    and their one hope is to have a genuine grievance to hug.</p>
    <p>When trouble is not suppressed permanently by a little friendly punishment, it is a
    sign that the virtue has gone out of the master. When the suffragette went from worse to
    worse and made severity itself inhuman and useless, it did not prove in the least that
    women had altered from the days of the jungle, but that industrialism and piety had sapped
    the virtue of the male. Rome did not fall because the Germans and the Gauls had in any way
    improved; they were just the same and could be beaten by the same tactics and weapons as
    in the earliest centuries. But Christianity had eaten the heart out of Rome. The manly
    virtues and the corresponding womanly virtues, one of which is recognition of the relation
    between the sexes, had been corrupted by slave morality. The England of Victoria, by
    bringing up the best stock in the country in the most favourable physical conditions, and
    teaching the boys from the start that they were brought into the world in order to rule
    it, produced a class of men who were like Old Testament heroes. (Under George III we had a
    rehearsal. Can it be that long prosperous</p>
    <p>{370}</p>
    <p>reigns favour the production of such men? We had another crop under Elizabeth, when the
    restoration of the abbeys to the people of England gave a chance to the development of a
    daring and dominant breed.) But the influences which are commonly called civilized
    attenuate the aristocratic spirit.</p>
    <p>The existence of a common scold is a definite system of imminent death in any
    community. The Indian renegades, from Lajpat Rai to Gandhi, are merely evidence that the
    sahib has given place to the competition wallah. India has not progressed in the last
    thousand years and will not in the next thousand. The biological impulse is expended.
    India was nature's attempt to construct a nation of diverse elements by welding them in a
    religious and moral system. It might have succeeded had it been secure against invasion.
    But while India has always conquered her conquerors (imposing, for example, the cast
    system on the English), the invaders interfered with the process of growth and diverted
    the national trend from unity.</p>
    <p>A nation lives by its architecture; when it comes to consciousness of its soul, it
    feels that it has to build a house for that soul to life in. Such buildings must be
    utterly useless; the soul will not live in a Woolworth Building --- that is inhabited by
    the unclean spirit whose name is Legion, and that is the evidence that America, with all
    its material prosperity, has no soul. Nor is a man rich while he confines his purchases to
    things which are useful.</p>
    <p>The love of my wife had made me the richest man on earth and developed my human soul to
    its full stature. I could afford to build a temple to love, and that of course had to be
    stupendous, useless and immortal. I made one disconcerting discovery, though not till long
    afterwards; this: that the erotic poetry does not spring from supreme satisfaction.
    Indeed, my life was a perfect lyric and left no surplus energy to overflow into words. I
    wrote nothing. The temple had to be, as I have said, and I could only think of
    constructing a long beautiful objectless journey. As soon as the summer showed signs of
    waning, we started on a hypertrophied honeymoon. We pretended to ourselves that we were
    going big-game shooting in Ceylon and to pay a visit to Allan at Rangoon (where he had now
    removed from Akyab), but the real object was to adorn the celebration of our love by
    setting it in a thousand suave and sparkling backgrounds. As my poetry had petered out, so
    had my Magick and my meditation. I let them go without a pang. I was supremely happy; love
    filled the universe; there was no room for anything else.</p>
    <p>I had not kept a diary. Day followed day, each a fresh facet of the diamond of delight.
    All I remember is that we made our preparations in London, trying and buying guns, giving
    dinners, and so on. We dazzled Paris for a day or two, but not without one sever shock.</p>
    <p>Rose and I were walking towards the Pont Alexandre III when it met</p>
    <p>{371}</p>
    <p>Vestigia, as we always called Mrs. Mathers. I had not seen her for a long time and we
    started an animated conversation. I noticed nothing peculiar. I do not live in the world
    of phenomena: I only visit it at rare intervals. I had forgotten Rose's existence. When
    Vistigia had gone, I realized that I had not introduced her to my wife. She did not ask me
    who it was. I told her. &quot;Oh,&quot; said she, &quot;I thought it was some model that
    you knew in the old days.&quot;</p>
    <p>The words came as a terrific shock. Vestigia had been our ideal of refinement, purity,
    spirituality and the rest. And then my mind informed me of what my eyes had seen, that
    Vestigia was painted thickly to the eyes --- did I say painted? I mean plastered. Where
    the camouflages stopped, there was a neck which could not have been washed for months. I
    learnt later that Mathers, falling upon evil times, had forced his wife to pose naked in
    one of the Montmartre shows which are put on for the benefit of ignorant and prurient
    people, especially provincials and English, and that even that was not the worst of it.</p>
    <p>Then we swooped down on Marseilles, perched on the terrace of Bertolini's at Naples and
    picked up a few crumbs. Our first breathing place was Cairo. It was one of the
    extravagances of our passion that suggested our spending a night together in the King's
    Chamber of the Great Pyramid. It was the gesture of the male showing off his plumage. I
    wanted my wife to see what a great Magician I was. We went, accordingly, after dinner,
    with candles. More from habit than anything else, as I imagine, I had with me a small
    notebook of Japanese vellum in which were written my principal invocations, etc. Among
    these was a copy of the &quot;Preliminary Invocation&quot; of <em>The Goetia</em>.</p>
    <p>We reached the King's Chamber after dismissing the servants at the foot of the Grand
    Gallery. By the light of a single candle placed on the edge of the coffer I began to read
    the invocation. But as I went on I noticed that I was no longer stooping to hold the page
    near the light. I was standing erect. Yet the manuscript was not less but more legible.
    Looking about me, I saw that the King's Chamber was glowing with a soft light which I
    immediately recognized as the astral light. I have been accustomed to describe the colour
    as ultra-violet, from its resemblance to those rays in the spectrum --- which I happen to
    be able to distinguish. The range varies, but it is quite noticeably beyond that visible
    to the normal human eye. The colour is not unlike that of an arc lamp; it is definitely
    less coloured than the light of a mercury lamp. If I had to affix a conventional label, I
    should probably say pale lilac. But the quality of the light is much more striking than
    the colour. Here the word phosphorescence occurs to the mind. It is one of the mysteries
    of physics that the total light of the sky is very much greater than can be accounted for
    by the luminous bodies in the heavens. There are various theories, but I personally
    believe that the force now called radio-activity</p>
    <p>{372}</p>
    <p>which we know to be possessed in some degree by every particle of matter, is
    responsible. Our eyes are affected with the impression of light by forces which are not in
    themselves recognized as luminous.</p>
    <p>However, back to the facts. The King's Chamber was aglow as if with the brightest
    tropical moonlight. The pitiful dirty yellow flame of the candle was like a blasphemy, and
    I put it out. The astral light remained during the whole of the invocation and for some
    time afterwards, though it lessened in intensity as we composed ourselves to sleep. For
    the rest, the floor of the King's Chamber is particularly uncompromising. In sleeping out
    on rocks, one can always accommodate oneself more or less to the local irregularities, but
    the King's Chamber reminded me of <em>Brand</em>; and I must confess to having passed a
    very uncomfortable night. I fear me dalliance had corrupted my Roman virtue. In the
    morning the astral light had completely disappeared and the only sound was the flitting of
    the bats.</p>
    <p>In a sort of way, I suppose I did consider myself rather a fine fellow to have been
    able to produce so striking a phenomenon with so little trouble. But it did not encourage
    me to go on with Magick. My wife was all in all.</p>
