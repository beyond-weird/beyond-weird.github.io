    <p>The sixth Chokmah day was devoted to a terrible ordeal. I had by this time been
    enlightened as to the falseness of the Cat; it therefore became my duty to slay her. I had
    created truth by means of an untrustworthy material and must therefore no longer cling to
    the image of the ideal. I must destroy it, well knowing that it would never again be
    possible for me to delude myself with poetical puppets. I must face reality for good and
    all.</p>
    <p>The desolation in my heart was unspeakably dreadful and the seventh Chokmah day found
    me in the same solitude and silence as the first three; with this difference: that a
    minister was appointed to comfort and console me. Exactly as before, every single relation
    that I had established snapped suddenly. I had plenty of friends; but none of them meant
    anything. However, my consolation was supreme. On the one hand, the despairing cynicism of
    the wise realist Snake, on the other, the heartless vanity of the foolish idealistic Cat,
    had left me hopeless for humanity.</p>
    <p>In this extremity, I met a very rare animal. A woman! She was a regular street-walker.
    She had been familiar with hardships, callousness, obsession, shame and poverty from her
    cradle; but she possessed every noble quality to the full. Hers was the true pride,
    generosity, purity and passion to which the Cat so basely pretended; and hers also the
    clear-insighted intelligence, the wide experience and deep insight of the Snake. Yet she
    had faced and conquered her foes, instead of acquiescing in despair.</p>
    <p>I am not one of those sentimental slop-mongers who are always finding angels in the
    mud. On the whole, my experience of outcast woman had not provoked any excess of sympathy.
    I thought that in most cases their own defects were responsible for their misfortunes.
    Indeed, I failed to realize consciously the sublimity of this girl until long afterwards.
    But today, I see clearly enough the nature of her mission; which ended as strangely as it
    began, at the close of the Chokmah day. She disappeared into the <em>Ewigkeit</em> without
    a word and all my efforts to trace her were fruitless.</p>
    <p>This day of repose and reward had prepared me for my next ordeal. At the beginning of
    the eighth day appeared a Monkey and an Owl. Once again I was confronted with the
    necessity of choosing between two ideas. The Monkey had all the insensate passion,
    volubility and vanity of the less developed primates. She was a great artist and a great
    lover; yet in each of these functions she displayed the utmost inanity of conceit. The
    Owl,</p>
    <p>{805}</p>
    <p>on the other hand, was incapable of sublimity and at the same time free from
    affectation. She was as pleasant and sensible as the Monkey was excruciating and absurd.</p>
    <p>The nature of my ordeal was twofold. In the first crisis, it was put up to me to do the
    right thing without permitting any interference from personal inclination or consideration
    of the ultimate consequences of my line of action. The test was applied at a conference of
    the parties chiefly concerned. The Monkey's husband wanted me to take her off his hands. A
    divorce was to be arranged and a marriage to follow. Asked to give my views, I began
    &quot;I have no personal feeling in the matter.&quot; The words were a bombshell. Both
    husband and wife realized, to their amazed horror, that they had neither of them any means
    of influencing my conduct. I found myself completely master of the situation. It is only
    necessary to destroy in oneself the roots of those motives which determine a man's course,
    in order to enjoy the omnipotence and immunity of a god.</p>
    <p>The second point of the ordeal concerned the choice between the women. The Owl offered
    all the delights of carefree ease and placid pleasure; but there was nothing to be gained.
    The Monkey represented a life of turmoil and anxiety, with few magnificent moments amid
    the hours of fretfulness; but progress was possible. It was as if the Secret Chiefs had
    asked me, &quot;Are you content to enjoy the fruit of your attainment and live at peace
    with the world, surrounded by affection, respect and comfort, or will you devote yourself
    to mastering and fertilizing mankind, despite the prospect of continual disquietude and
    almost certain disappointment?&quot; I chose the Monkey. I was perfectly willing to make
    the best of the Owl, in my spare time, so to speak; but I accepted the responsibility
    attached to her rival without reservation.</p>
    <p>A single day was sufficient for this part of the initiation. At the dawn of the ninth
    day all had been arranged. The Monkey went to England to wind up certain of her affairs
    and the Owl had no string on me. I was thus able to undertake a Great Magical Retirement
    in June. For this purpose I went to live in a cottage on the shores of Lake Pasquaney in
    New Hampshire. My initiation now took on a more strictly magical character. I was able to
    enter into direct communication with the realities of existence instead of conducting them
    by means of symbolic gestures.</p>
    <p>My very first experience was the announcement of the birth of my &quot;son&quot;, as
    above mentioned. I did not understand the matter in that light but in this: that by means
    of my system of training, a man had crossed the Abyss and become a Master of the Temple in
    much shorter period than had ever been known. My own case had been extraordinary. Eleven
    years had sufficed me to accomplish a task which in human experience had never required
    much less than triple the time. Moreover, the conditions had been almost</p>
    <p>{806}</p>
    <p>uniquely favourable for me. I possessed all the qualities, all the resources requisite.</p>
    <p>In the case of O.I.V. the period was shorter still, and by much; while for him the
    conditions had been wholly adverse. He was obliged to earn his living in a distasteful and
    exhausting manner. His domestic circumstances were atrocious. He had not the means of
    travel or even of scholastic research. I could only conclude that his success was almost
    wholly due to the excellence of the system which I had given to the world. In short, it
    was the justification of my whole life, the unique and supreme reward of my immeasurable
    toils.</p>
    <p>Fortified and rejoiced by this good news, I began at once to devote myself to research
    in the strict sense of the word.</p>
    <p>And then the fun began! I found myself unable to do anything of the sort. I am not
    quite sure how the circumstances responsible for this fit in with my general situation,
    but they are well worthy of record for their own sake.</p>
    <p>I have mentioned elsewhere that in the bosom of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the
    O.T.O. is cherished a magical formula, extremely simple and practical, for attaining any
    desired object. It is, however, peculiarly appropriate to the principal operations of
    alchemy, most of all the preparation of the Elixir of Life and the Universal Medicine. At
    first I used this method casually. It was only when various unexpectedly and even
    astoundingly successful operations compelled my attention, that I devoted myself
    systematically and scientifically to the serious study and practice of it. For some two
    and a half years I had conducted a careful and strenuous research into the conditions of
    success. Experience had shown me that sometimes this was complete, but at others partial
    or even negligible, while not infrequently the work would result in failure, perhaps
    almost amounting to disaster.</p>
    <p>Just before leaving New York I had prepared by this method an elixir whose virtue
    should be to restore youth, and of this I had taken seven doses. Nothing particular
    happened at first; and it never occurred to me that it might be imprudent to continue.</p>
    <p>I was mistaken. Hardly had I reached my hermitage before I was suddenly seized with an
    attack of youth in its acutest form. All mental activity became distasteful. I turned into
    a mere vehicle of physical energy. I could hardly bring myself to read a book even of the
    lightest kind. I could not satisfy my instincts by paddling the canoe which I had
    imported. I spent about an hour every day in housework and cooking; the remaining fifteen
    hours of waking life were filled by passionately swinging an axe without interruption. I
    could hardly stop to smoke a pipe.</p>
    <p>There was no self-delusion about this, as I might have persuaded myself to believe in
    the absence of external evidence. But this was furnished by an irrefutable monument. I
    wanted to build a wharf for my canoe. With this</p>
    <p>{807}</p>
    <p>object I cut down a tree and trimmed a twenty-two foot log. Its circumference at the
    smaller end was too great for my arms to meet round it. My only instrument for moving this
    was a wooden pole. The tree had fallen about a hundred yards from the bank; and though it
    was downhill all the way to the lake, the ground was very uneven and the path so narrow
    that it was impossible to roll the log at all. Nevertheless, I moved it singlehanded into
    the lake, where I fixed it by driving piles. Passers-by spread the story of the hermit
    with superhuman strength, and people came from all parts to gaze upon the miracle. I
    should mention that normally my physical strength is far below the average, especially for
    work of this kind. It is quite an effort for me to shift a sixty pound load for even a few
    feet.</p>
    <p>So much for the sufficiently remarkable truth. Of course imagination improved on the
    story. I received an indignant letter from New York from the lady who had lent me the
    cottage, reproaching me for having built a dam right across the lake, to the detriment of
    navigation!</p>
    <p>This spasm of energy continued without abatement for some three weeks, after which I
    gradually recovered the balance of my normal faculties. The effect of my operations was
    now to increase the energy of each of them, but in reasonable proportion. I was now able
    to begin my proposed magical research.</p>
    <p>In order to erect the temple of the New Aeon, it appeared necessary to make a thorough
    clearance of the rubbish of its ruined predecessors. I therefore planned and executed a
    Magical Operation to banish the &quot;Dying God&quot;. I had written in &quot;the Wizard Way</a>&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>He had crucified a toad<br>
            In the Basilisk abode</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and now I did so. The theory of the Operation was to identify the toad with the
    &quot;Dying God&quot; and slay it. At the same time I caused the elemental spirit of the
    slain reptile to serve me.</p>
    <p>The result was immediately apparent. A girl of the village, three miles away, asked me
    to employ her as my secretary. I had had no intention of doing any literary work; but as
    soon as I set eyes on her I recognized that she had been sent for a purpose, for she
    exactly resembled the aforesaid toad. I therefore engaged her to come out every morning an
    take dictation. I had with me a copy of Bernard Shaw's <em>Androcles and the Lion</em> and
    bethought myself that I would criticize the preface. The almost unparalleled knowledge of
    the text of the Bible which I had acquired in early childhood was shocked by Shaw's
    outrageously arbitrary selection of the texts that sustained his argument. His ignorance
    of Asiatic life and thought had led him into the most grotesque misapprehensions. I set
    out to criticize his essay, section by section; but the work grew under my hand, and in
    three</p>
    <p>{808}</p>
    <p>weeks or so, I had produced a formidable treatise of some forty-five thousand words. I
    had intended to confine myself to destructive criticism of my author; but as I went on, my
    analysis of the text of the gospels revealed the mystery of their composition. It became
    clear both those who believe in the historicity of &quot;Jesus&quot; and their opponents
    were at fault. I could not doubt that actual incidents and genuine sayings in the life of
    a real man formed part of the structure. The truth was that scraps of several such men,
    distinct from and incompatible with each other, had been pitch-forked together and
    labelled with a single name. It was exactly the case of the students who stuck together
    various parts of various insects and asked their professor, &quot;What kind of a bug is
    this?&quot; &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he replied, &quot;this is a humbug.&quot;</p>
    <p>In writing this book, I was much assisted by Frazer's <em>Golden Bough</em> and, to a
    less extent, by Jung's <em>Psychology of the Unconscious</em>. But my main assets were my
    intimate knowledge of the text of the gospels, of the conditions of life and thought in
    the East, of the details of magical and mystical work, and of the literary conventions
    which old writers employed to convey their ideas.</p>
    <p>I may mention the absurdity of Shaw finding difficulty in the fact that the visit of
    the three &quot;Kings&quot; is not mentioned in profane history. Shaw did not realize that
    a &quot;King&quot; may be the equivalent of a very minor chieftain in the Highlands.</p>
    <p>Again the injunctions to abandon family ties and worldly cares involve no social
    theories. They are addressed only to would-be disciples, and have been so given --- from
    the dawn of history to the present day --- by every Eastern teacher that ever balanced
    himself upon one thumb, used a hip bath instead of a soup plate, or rode the Wheel of
    Samsara in preference to a bicycle.</p>
    <p>Once more, the irrational incidents of the life of Christ become entirely normal when
    understood as the rubric of a ritual of initiation.</p>
    <p>I claim that my book establishes the outline of an entirely final theory of the
    construction of Christianity. The subject is far too vast and complex to be adequately
    discussed in this autohagiography. But I have no hesitation in referring the student to my
    essay for the solution of any and every difficulty which he may have found in the
    consideration of this matter.</p>
    <p>Having completed this treatise, I discovered myself to be inspired to write a number of
    short stories based on <em>The Golden Bough</em>. They are &quot;The Hearth&quot;,
    &quot;The God of Ibreez&quot;, &quot;The Burning of Melcarth&quot;, &quot;The Old Man of
    the Peepul Tree&quot;, &quot;The Mass of St Secaire&quot;, &quot;The King of the
    Wood&quot;, &quot;The Oracle of Cocytus&quot; and &quot;The Stone of Cybele&quot;.</p>
    <p>Now with regard to my magical work strictly speaking, its character was presumably
    determined by my Grade. The Magus corresponds to the Sephira Chokmah, whose manifestation
    in the universe is Masloth, the</p>
    <p>{809}</p>
    <p>Sphere of the Fixed Stars. It was accordingly proper that I should receive a revelation
    of the universe in this aspect. I began my meditation with no special objective in view.
    Almost immediately (instead of after a long- continued effort, as had been the case
    generally speaking in the past) I obtained a Samadhi of which my conscious memory brought
    back the account &quot;Nothingness and twinkles&quot;, adding subsequently &quot;but what
    twinkles!&quot; This Samadhi developed in the course of time, as I repeated it, into such
    importance that I feel almost justified in calling it the radix of my whole philosophical
    outlook. I have described it, giving historical details, in my Comment on <em>The Book of
    the Law</em>, ch. I, v. 59. It seems convenient to quote this in this place, as throwing
    light upon the progress of my inmost apprehension of the universe from this time forward.</p>
    <p align="center">THE &quot;STAR-SPONGE&quot; VISION</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There is a vision of a peculiar character which has been of cardinal importance in my
      interior life, and to which constant reference is made in my magical diaries. So far as I
      know, there is no extant description of this vision anywhere, and I was surprised on
      looking through my records to find that I had given no clear account of it myself.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The vision developed gradually. It was repeated on so many occasions that I am unable
      to say at what period it may be called complete.</p>
      <p>I was on a retirement in a cottage overlooking Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire. I lost
      consciousness of everything but a universal space in which were innumerable bright points,
      and I realized this as a physical representation of the universe, in what I may call its
      essential structure. I exclaimed, &quot;Nothingness with twinkles!&quot; I concentrated
      upon this vision, with the result that the void space which had been the principal element
      of it diminished in importance; space appeared to be ablaze, yet the radiant points were
      not confused, and I thereupon completed my sentence with the exclamation, &quot;but what
      twinkles!&quot;</p>
      <p>The next stage of this vision led to an identification of the blazing points with the
      stars of the firmament, with ideas, souls, etc. I perceived also that each star was
      connected by a ray of light with each other star. In the world of ideas each thought
      possessed a necessary relation with each other thought; each such relation is of course a
      thought in itself; each such ray is itself a star. It is here that the logical difficulty
      first presents itself. The seer has a direct perception of infinite series. Logically,
      therefore, it would appear as if the entire space must be filled up with a homogeneous
      blaze of light. This however is not the case. The space is completely full and yet the
      monads which fill it are perfectly distinct. The ordinary reader might well exclaim that
      such statements exhibit symptoms of mental confusion.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{810}</p>
    <p>A further development of the vision brought to the consciousness that the structure of
    the universe was highly organized, that certain stars were of greater magnitude and
    brilliancy than the rest.</p>
    <p>While at Montauk, I had put my sleeping bag to dry in the sun. When I went to take it
    in, I remarked, laughingly, &quot;Your bedtime, Master Bag,&quot; as if it were a small
    boy and I its nurse. This was entirely frivolous; but the thought flashed into my mind
    that after all the bag was in one sense a part of myself. The two ideas came together with
    a snap, and I understood the machinery of a man's delusion that he is a teapot.</p>
    <p>From this I came to another discovery: I perceived why platitudes were stupid. The
    reason was that they represented the summing up of trains of thought, each of which was
    superb in every detail at one time. A platitude was like a wife after a few years; she has
    lost none of her charms, and yet one prefers some perfectly worthless woman.</p>
    <p>It would be quite impracticable to go fully into the subject of this vision of the
    Star-Sponge. It must suffice to reiterate that it has been the basis of most of my work
    for the last five years, and to remind the reader that the essential form of it is
    &quot;Nothingness with twinkles&quot;.</p>
