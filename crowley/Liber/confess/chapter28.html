    <p>Allan's adventures in Ceylon had been varied. His first idea had been to take the
    Yellow Robe; that is, to become a member of the Buddhist Sangha. These men are not priests
    or monks, as we understand the words; it is hard for European minds to understand the
    conditions of their life. They have renounced the world and live as mendicants; but it may
    be stated roughly that the rules of their Order, which are very complex and often seem
    irrational or frivolous, are all devised in the interest of a single idea. Each rule meets
    some probably contingency. But in every case the object is to enable the bhikkhu to carry
    out his programme of spiritual development. There are no superstitious terrors, no
    propitiatory practices; the while object is to enable a man to free himself from the
    fetters of desire which hamper his actions, and (incidentally) produce the phantasms which
    we call phenomena. In Buddhism, the universe is conceived as an illusion, created by
    ignorant cravings. It is, in fact, a dream as defined by Freud's hypothesis.</p>
    <p>Allan was already at heart a Buddhist. The more he studied the Tripitika, &quot;the
    three baskets of the law&quot; --- waste paper baskets I used to call them --- the more he
    was attracted, but he was fearfully disappointed by the degeneracy of the Singalese
    bhikkhus. With rate exceptions, they were ignorant, idle, immoral and dishonest. At
    Anuradhapura, the sacred ruined city, there conduct is so openly scandalous as to have
    given rise to a proverb: &quot;A bhikkhu is made, not born --- except at
    Anuradhapura.&quot; Allan had been offered the post of treasurer to a famous monastery
    outside Colombo, for the avowed reason that they could not trust any one of themselves.
    Considering that a bhikkhu is not allowed to touch money at all, this was rather the
    limit.</p>
    <p>The Solicitor-Generral of Ceylon, the Hon. P. Ramanathan, engaged Allan as private
    tutor to his younger sons. This gentleman was a man of charming personality, wide culture
    and profound religious knowledge. He was eminent as a yogi of the Shaivite sect of Hindus
    (he was a Tamil of high caste) and had written commentaries on the gospels of Matthew and
    John, interpreting the sayings of Christ as instructions in Yoga. It is indeed a fact that
    one of the characters who have been pieced together to compose the figure of
    &quot;Jesus&quot; was a yogi. His injunctions to abandon family ties, to make no provision
    for the future, and so on, are typical.</p>
    <p>From this man, Allan learnt a great deal of the theory and practice of Yoga. When he
    was about eighteen, Allan had accidentally stumbled into</p>
    <p>{237}</p>
    <p>the trance called Shivadarshana, in which the universe, having been perceived in its
    totality as a single phenomenon, independent of space and time, is then annihilated. This
    experience had determined the whole course of his life. His one object was to get back
    into that state. Shri Parananda showed him a rational practical method of achieving his.
    Yet Allan was not wholly in sympathy with his teacher, who, despite his great spiritual
    experience, had not succeeded in snapping the shackles of dogma, and whose practice seem
    in some respects tat variance with his principles. Allan was almost puritanically strict.
    He had been offered a position as manager of a coconut plantation, but refused it on
    learning that his duties would involve giving orders for the destruction of vermin. He had
    not sufficient breadth of view to see that any kind of life implies acquiescence in, and
    therefore responsibility for, murder; by eating rice one becomes the accomplice of the
    agriculturist in destroying life.</p>
    <p>His health was vastly improved. In the Red Sea his asthma completely disappeared and he
    had thrown overboard his entire apparatus of drugs. But the enervating climate of Colombo
    sapped his energies. He had little hesitation in accepting my proposal to go and live at
    Kandy and devote ourselves to Yoga.</p>
    <p>At &quot;Marlborough&quot; we found the conditions for work very favourable. The firs
    step was to get rid of all other preoccupations. I revised <em>Tannhäuser</em>, wrote an
    introduction, typed it all out and sent it to the press. I put aside <em>Orpheus</em> and
    left aside <em>Alice, An Adultery</em> to ripen. I did not think much of it; and would not
    publish it until time had ratified it.</p>
    <p>One of my principal inhibitions at this period was due to the apparent antinomy between
    the normal satisfaction of bodily appetites and the obvious conditions of success. I did
    not solve this completely until my attainment of the Grade of Mater of the Temple in 1909,
    when at last I realized that every thought, word and act might be pressed into the service
    of the soul: more, that it must be if the soul were ever to be free. I &quot;mixed up the
    planes&quot; for many years to some extent, though never as badly as most mystics do.</p>
    <p>During this retirement I was fortunate in being under the constant vigilant supervision
    of Allan Bennett, whose experience enabled him to detect the firs onset of disturbing
    ideas. For instance, the revising and typing of <em>Tannhäuser</em> were quite sufficient
    to distract my mind from meditation, and would even upset me in such apparently
    disconnected matters as Pranayama. It is easy to understand that a heavy meal will
    interfere with one's ability to control one's respiration; but one is inclined to laugh at
    the Hindu theory that it can be affected by such things as casual conversation. None the
    less, they are right. Apart from one's normal reactions, these practices make one
    supersensitive. I was not confining myself to any rigid</p>
    <p>{238}</p>
    <p>diet; and I remember that at a certain period the idea of food became utterly
    revolting. It is doubtless a question of nervous hyperaesthesia; as is well known,
    over-indulgence in alcohol and certain other drugs tends to destroy the appetite.
    Inexperienced practitioners, insufficiently grounded in physiology and philosophy, may
    perhaps be excused (though of course reproved) for misunderstanding the import of the
    phenomena. One is inclined to say, &quot;Now that I am becoming holy, I find that I
    dislike the idea of eating: Argal, eating is unholy; and it will help me to become still
    holier if I resolutely suppress the squeals of appetite.&quot; Such, I believe, is the
    basis of much of the fantastic morality which has muddled mystical teaching throughout
    history. I do not think that straightforward a priori considerations would have carried
    unquestioning conviction in the absence of apparent confirmation of their hypotheses.</p>
    <p>This &quot;confusion of the planes&quot; is in my opinion the chief cause of failure to
    attain. It is constantly cropping up in all sorts of connections. The aspirant must be
    armed with the Magical Sword, dividing asunder the joints of the marrow of every
    observation that he makes. A single unanalysed idea is liable to obsess him and send him
    astray: &quot;It may be for years and it may be for ever.&quot; He must never weary of
    assigning its exact limitations to every phenomenon. History, by the way, is full of
    examples of this error in major matters. Consider only how the idea that epidemics, the
    failure of the crops and military misfortune were due to the wrath of God, prevented the
    development of science, agriculture and the art of war. Last spring, 1922, there was a
    drought in Sicily. The priests made a mighty puja and prayed for rain. The rain came and
    did more harm than the drought; then the drought took hold again and lasted all the summer
    either in spite of the intercessions of Cybele, or whatever they call her nowadays, or
    because she was not to be propitiated by the adulterated sacrifices with which her modern
    ministers pretend that they can cozen her.</p>
    <p>I attribute my own success in mysticism and Magick, and the much greater success that I
    have been able to secure for my successors, almost entirely to my scientific training. It
    enabled me to determine the actual physiological and psychological conditions of
    attainment. My experience as a teacher enables me to simplify more and more as each fresh
    case comes under my notice. I can put my finger more quickly and surely on the spot with
    every waxing moon. I achieved in eleven years what hardly anyone before had done in forty,
    and it cannot be explained by individual genius, for I have been able to take men with
    hardly a scrap of talent and teach them what took me eleven years in seven or eight for
    the firstcomers, in five or six for their successors, and so on till, at the present
    moment, I feel able to promise any man or woman of average ability who has the germ of
    genuine aspiration, the essence of attainment within eight sessions. Of course it</p>
    <p>{239}</p>
    <p>depends on each postulant to determine the details. Some departments of occult science
    lie outside the scope of particular people; each one must fill in for himself his personal
    programme. But the supreme emancipation is the same in essence for all, and for the first
    time in history it has been possible to present this free from confusion, so that people
    can concentrate from the very beginning of their training on the one thing that matters.</p>
    <p>Our life was delightfully simple. Allan taught me the principles of Yoga;
    fundamentally, there is only one. The problem is how to stop thinking; for the theory is
    that the mind is a mechanism for dealing symbolically with impressions; its construction
    is such that one is tempted to take these symbols for reality. Conscious thought,
    therefore, is fundamentally false and prevents one from perceiving reality. The numerous
    practices of yoga are simply dodges to help one to acquire the knack of slowing down the
    current of thought and ultimately stopping at altogether. This fact has not been realized
    by the yogis themselves. Religious doctrines and sentimental or ethical considerations
    have obscured the truth. I believe I am entitled to the credit of being the first man to
    understand the true bearings of the question.</p>
    <p>I was led to this discovery chiefly through studying comparative mysticism. For
    instance; a Catholic repeats Ave Maria rapidly and continuously; they rhythm inhibits the
    intellectual process. The result is an ecstatic vision of Mary. The Hindu repeats Aum Hari
    Aum in the same way and gets a vision of Vishnu. But I noticed that the characteristics of
    both visions were identical save for the sectarian terminology in which the memory
    recorded them. I argued that process and result were identical. It was a physiological
    phenomenon and the apparent divergence was due to the inability of the mind to express the
    event except by using the language of worship which was familiar.</p>
    <p>Extended study and repeated experiment have confirmed this conviction. I have thus been
    able to simplify the process of spiritual development by eliminating all dogmatic
    accretions. To get into a trance is of the same order of phenomena as to get drunk. It
    does not depend on creed. Virtue is only necessary in so far as it favours success; just
    as certain diets, neither right nor wrong in themselves, are indicated for the athlete or
    the diabetic. I am proud of having made it possible for my pupils to achieve in months
    what previously required as many years. Also, of having saved the successful from the
    devastating delusion that the intellectual image of their experience is an universal
    truth.</p>
    <p>This error has wrought more mischief in the past than any other. Mohammed's conviction
    that his visions were of imperative importance to &quot;salvation&quot; made him a
    fanatic. Almost all religious tyranny springs from intellectual narrowness. The spiritual
    energy derived from the high trances makes the seer a formidable force; and unless he be
    aware that his interpretation is</p>
    <p>{240}</p>
    <p>due only to the exaggeration of his own tendencies of thought, he will seek to impose
    it on others, and so delude his disciples, pervert their minds and prevent their
    development. He can do good only in one way, that is by publishing the methods by which he
    attained illumination: in other words, by adding his experience to the sum of scientific
    knowledge. I have myself striven strenuously to do this, always endeavouring to make it
    clear that my results are of value only to myself, and that even my methods may need
    modification in every case, just as each poet, golfer and barrister must acquire a style
    peculiar to his idiosyncrasies.</p>
    <p>Yoga, properly understood, is thus a simple scientific system of attaining a definite
    psychological state. Consider its Eight Branches! Yama and Niyama, &quot;Control&quot; and
    &quot;Super-control&quot;, give rules for preventing the mind from being disturbed by
    moral emotions and passions, such as anger, fear, greed, lust and the like.</p>
    <p>Asana, &quot;position&quot;, is the art of sitting perfectly still, so that the body
    can no longer send messages to the mind. Pranayama, &quot;control of breath force&quot;,
    consists in learning to breathe as slowly, deeply and regularly as possible. The slightest
    mental irritation or excitement always makes one breathe quickly and unevenly; thus one is
    able to detect any disturbance of calm by observing this system. Also, by forcibly
    controlling the breath one can banish such ideas. Also one reduces to a minimum the
    consciousness that one is breathing.</p>
    <p>One may remark at this point that such precaution seems absurd; but until one begins to
    try to keep the mind from wandering, one has no conception of the way in which the
    minutest modifications of thought, impressions which are normally transitory or
    unperceived, form the starting point for Odysseys of distraction. It may be several
    minutes before one wakes up to the fact that one's wits have gone wool-gathering.</p>
    <p>Pratyahara is introspection. One obtains the power of analysing an apparently simple
    thought or impression into its elements. One can, for example, teach oneself to feel
    separately the numberless impressions connected with the act of crooking one's fingers.
    This is a revelation in itself; so simple a muscular movement is found to contain an epic
    of deliciously exciting ingredients. The idea is, of course, not to enjoy such pleasures,
    subtle and exquisite as they are; but by analysing thoughts and impressions to detect
    their prodromal symptoms and nip them in the bud. Also, to understand and estimate them by
    detailed examination. One important result of this is to appreciate the unimportance and
    equivalence of all thoughts, very much as modern chemistry has put and end to the medieval
    nonsense about the sacredness of some compounds and the wickedness of others. Another is
    to give one a clear and comprehensive view of the elements of the universe as a whole.</p>
    <p>{241}</p>
    <p>Dharana, concentration, is now easier to practise. One has learnt what interruptions to
    expect and how to prevent them. We, therefore, make a definite attack on the multiplicity
    of thoughts by fixing the mind on one. In my <em>Book Four</em>, Part I, I have copied
    from my diary at this period an attempt at classification of invading ideas. I am very
    proud of this apparently simple observation and it will aid the reader to understand my
    work in Kandy if I insert it.</p>
    <p><em>Breaks</em> are classed as follows:</p>
    <p><em>Firstly</em>, physical sensations. These should have been overcome by Asana.</p>
    <p><em>Secondly</em>, breaks that seem to be dictated by events immediately preceding the
    meditation. Their activity becomes tremendous. Only by this practice does one understand
    how much is really observed by the senses without the mind becoming conscious of it.</p>
    <p><em>Thirdly</em>, there is a class of breaks partaking of the nature of reverie or
    &quot;daydreams&quot;. These are very insidious --- one may go on for a long time without
    realizing that one has wandered at all.</p>
    <p><em>Fourthly</em>, we get a very high class of break, which is as sort of aberration of
    the control itself. You think, &quot;How well I am doing it!&quot; or perhaps that it
    would be rather a good idea if your were on a desert island, or if your were in a
    sound-proof house, or if your were sitting by a waterfall. But these are only trifling
    variations from the vigilance itself.</p>
    <p><em>A fifth class of breaks</em> seems to have no discoverable source in the mind. Such
    may even take the form of actual hallucination, usually auditory. Of course, such
    hallucinations are infrequent and are recognized for what they are; otherwise the student
    had better see his doctor. The usual kind consists of odd sentences or fragments of
    sentences, which are heard quite distinctly in a recognizable human voice, not the
    student's own voice or that of any one he knows. A similar phenomenon is observed by
    wireless operators, who call such messages &quot;atmospherics&quot;.</p>
    <p>There is <em>a further kind of break, which is the desired result itself</em>. It must
    be dealt with later in detail.</p>
    <p>Dhyana is the name of the first trance. By trance I mean a state of consciousness
    definitely distinct from the normal. Its characteristic is that whereas in normal
    consciousness two things are always present --- the percipient and the perceived --- in
    Dhyana these two have become one. At first this union usually takes place with explosive
    violence. There are many other characteristics; in particular, time and space are
    abolished. This, however, occurs with almost equal completeness in certain states of
    normal abstract thought.</p>
    <p>{242}</p>
    <p>The attainment of this trance is likely to upset the whole moral balance of the
    student. He often attributes and exaggerated importance to the imperfect ideas which
    represent his memory of what happened. He cannot possibly remember the thing itself,
    because his mind lacks the machinery of translating it into normal thought. These ideas
    are naturally his pet delusions. They seem to him to have become armed with supreme
    spiritual sanction, so he may be come a fanatic or a megalomaniac. In my system the pupil
    is taught to analyse all ideas and abolish them by philosophical skepticism before he is
    allowed to undertake the practices which lead to Dhyana.</p>
    <p>Samadhi, &quot;Union with the Lord&quot;, is the general term for the final trance, or
    rather, series of trances. It differs from Dhyana in this way: Dhyana is partial, Samadhi
    is universal. In the first Samadhi, the universe is perceived as a unity. In the second
    that unity is annihilated. There are, however, may other Samadhis, and in any case the
    quality of the trance will depend upon the extent of the universe which enters into it.
    One must really be a profound philosopher with a definite intellectual conception of the
    universe as an organic whole, based on the co-ordination of immense knowledge, before one
    can expect really satisfactory results. The Samadhi of an ignorant and shallow thinker who
    has failed to co-ordinate his conceptions of the cosmos will not be worth very much.</p>
