    <p>I began my last year at Cambridge with my moral decks cleared for action. I didn't know
    where I was going, but I was on the way. I was thus quite ready for the perception of the
    First Noble Truth, but also for an entirely new current to influence my life. Towards the
    end of the October term I met a man named Herbert Charles Jerome Pollitt. He was an M.A.,
    ten years older than myself, and had merely come up to Cambridge to dance for the F.D.C.
    (Footlights Dramatic Club). I saw him only once or twice that term, but corresponded with
    him from abroad during the Christmas vacation. The result was the establishment of the
    first intimate friendship of my life.</p>
    <p>Pollitt was rather plain than otherwise. His face was made tragic by the terrible
    hunger of the eyes and the bitter sadness of the mouth. He possessed one physical beauty
    --- his hair. This was very plentiful and he wore it rather long. It was what is called a
    shock. But its colour was pale gold, like spring sunshine, and its texture of the finest
    gossamer. The relation between us was that ideal intimacy which the Greeks considered the
    greatest glory of manhood and the most precious prize of life. It says much for the moral
    state of England that such ideas are connected in the minds of practically every one with
    physical passion.</p>
    <p>My sexual life was very intense. My relations with women were entirely satisfactory.
    They gave me the maximum of bodily enjoyment and at the same time symbolized my
    theological notions of sin. Love was a challenge to Christianity. It was a degradation and
    a damnation. Swinburne had taught me the doctrine of justification by sin. Every woman
    that I met enabled me to affirm magically that I had defied the tyranny of the Plymouth
    Brethren and the Evangelicals. At the same time women were the source of romantic
    inspiration; and their caresses emancipated me from the thraldom of the body. When I left
    them I found myself walking upon air, with my soul free to wing its way through endless
    empyreans and to express its godhead in untrammelled thought of transcendent sublimity,
    expressed in language which combined the purest aspirations with the most majestic
    melodies. Poems like &quot;the Philosopher's Progress&quot; illustrate my unconscious, and
    poems like &quot;De Profundis&quot; my conscious reaction. But, morally and mentally,
    women were for me beneath contempt. They had no true moral ideals. They were bound up with
    their necessary preoccupation, with the function of reproduction. Their apparent
    aspirations were camouflage. Intellectually, of course, they did not exist. Even the few
    whose minds</p>
    <p>{142}</p>
    <p>were not completely blank had them furnished with Wardour Street Chippendale. Their
    attainments were those of the ape and the parrot. These facts did not deter me. On the
    contrary, it was highly convenient that one's sexual relations should be with an animal
    with no consciousness beyond sex.</p>
    <p>As to my men friends, I had never met anyone of sufficiently exalted ideals and
    refinement to awaken serious sympathy. Pollitt was a new species. My feeling for him was
    an intensely pure flame of admiration mingled with infinite pity for his spiritual
    disenchantment. It was infinite because it could not even imagine a goal and dwelt wholly
    amid eternal things.</p>
    <p>To him I was a mind --- no more. He never manifested the slightest interest in any of
    my occupations. He had no sympathy with any of my ambitions, not even my poetry, except in
    a very peculiar way, which I have never thoroughly understood. He showed an instinctive
    distrust of my religious aspirations, because he realized that sooner or later they would
    take me out of his reach. He had himself no hope or fear of anything beyond the material
    world. But he never tired of the originality of my point of view; of watching the way in
    which my brain dealt with every subject that came under discussion.</p>
    <p>It was the purest and noblest relation which I had ever had with anybody. I had not
    imagined the possibility of so divine a development. It was, in a sense, passionate,
    because it partook of the white heat of creative energy and because its intensity absorbed
    all other emotions. But for this very reason it was impossible to conceive of it as liable
    to contamination by any grosser qualities. Indeed, the universe of sense was entirely
    subordinated to its sanctity. It was based upon impressions as an incandescent light upon
    its filament. But the world was transfigured and consumed by the ineffable intensity of
    the spiritual consciousness. It was so free from any impure ingredient that my friendship
    with Pollitt in no way interfered with the current of my life. I went on reading, writing,
    climbing, skating, cycling and intriguing, as if I had never met him.</p>
    <p>Yet his influence initiated me in certain important respects. He was a close friend of
    Beardsley's and introduced me to the French and English renaissance. In his heart was a
    hunger for beauty which I can only call hideous and cruel, because it was so hopeless. He
    totally lacked illumination in the mystical sense of the word. His outlook on life was
    desperate, very much like that of Des Esseintes. He suffered like Tintagiles. He could not
    accept any of the usual palliatives and narcotics; he had no creative genius, no ideals;
    he could not deceive himself about life, art or religion. He merely yearned and moaned. In
    certain respects he annoyed me, because I was determined to make my dreams come true; and
    he represented eternal dissatisfaction. In his heart was &quot;the worm that dieth not and
    the fire that is not quenched&quot;.</p>
    <p>{143}</p>
    <p>The school of art and literature to which he introduced me was thus one which I
    instinctively despised, even while I adored it. The intense refinement of its thought and
    the blazing brilliance of its techinque helped me to key myself up to a pitch of artistry
    entirely beyond my original scope; but I never allowed myself to fall under its dominion.
    I was determined to triumph, to find my way out on the other side. Baudelaire and
    Swinburne, at their best, succeed in celebrating the victory of the human soul over its
    adversaries, just as truly as Milton and Shelly. I never had a moment's doubt that I
    belonged to this school. To me it is a question of virility. Even James Thomson, ending
    with &quot;confirmation of the old despair&quot;, somehow defeats that despair by the
    essential force of his genius. Keats, on the contrary, no matter how hard he endeavours to
    end on a note of optimism, always leaves an impression of failure.</p>
    <p>I well know how strangely perverse this criticism must sound, but I feel its truth in
    the marrow of my bones. In my own writings the tempestuous energy of my soul invariably
    sweeps away the wreckage of my mind. No matter to what depth I plunge, I always end with
    my wings beating steadily upwards towards the sun. The actual writing which releases my
    unconscious produces the effect. I inevitably end by transcending the problem of the poem,
    either lyrically or satirically. Turn to any page at random and the truth of this will
    become apparent.</p>
    <p>In his time at Cambridge Pollitt had been very prominent as a female impersonator and
    dancer. He called himself Diane de Rougy --- <em>aprés</em> Liane de Pougy. The grossness
    of people who do not understand art naturally misinterpreted this aesthetic gesture and
    connected it with a tendency to androgynity. I never saw the slightest symptoms of
    anything of the kind in him; though the subject sometimes came under discussion. But at
    that time it was considered criminal to admire <em>Lady Windermere's Fan</em>. I have
    always take the attitude of Bishop Blougram and pay no attention to</p>
    <p align="center">the infamy scrawled abroad<br>
    About me on the church wall opposite.</p>
    <p>I have made a point of understanding the psychology of the subject: <em>Nihil humani a
    me alienum puto</em>.</p>
    <p>But the conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who
    investigate heresies must be heretics; just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a
    leper. Indeed, it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without
    reproach. Matter being evil, the less that we know about it the better --- such was the
    Christian philosophy in the ages which it darkened. Morris Travers told me that his
    father, an eminent physician, had been ostracized, and had lost much of his practice, for
    joining the Anthropological society. Later still, Havelock Ellis and</p>
    <p>{144}</p>
    <p>Edward Carpenter have been treated with the foulest injustice by ignorant and
    prejudiced people. My mother always believed that <em>Great Eastern</em>, the first
    steamship of any size to speak of, met with repeated disasters because God was jealous, as
    He had been of the tower of Babel. In 1917 my cousin, Lawrence Bishop, told me that he
    thought that &quot;the Lord prepared a great iceberg&quot; for the <em>Titanic</em> in
    annoyance at the claim of the shipbilders that she was unsinkable. William Whiteley had
    several fires, which my mother took as the repartee of the Almighty to the merchant's
    assumption of the title &quot;Universal Provider&quot;, which could be properly attributed
    only to God.</p>
    <p>It is the modern fashion to try to dismiss these barbarous absurdities as excrescences
    on Christianity, but they are of the essence of the religion. The whole theory of the
    atonement implies that man can set up his own will in opposition to God's, and thereby
    excites Him to anger which can only be pacified by the sacrifice of His son. It is, after
    all, quite as reasonable to think of God as being irritated by a shipbuilding programme as
    by idolatry. The tendency has, in fact, been to forget about the atonement altogether and
    to represent Jesus as a &quot;Master&quot; whose teachings are humanitarian and
    enlightened. Yet the only evidence of what he actually said is that of the gospels and
    these not only insist upon the incredible and immoral sides of Christianity, but contain
    actual Logia which exhibit Jesus in the character of a superstitious fanatic who taught
    the doctrine of eternal punishment and many others unacceptable to modern enlightenment.
    General Booth and Billy Sunday preach perfectly scriptural abominations. Again, much of
    the teaching of Jesus which is not savage superstition is diametrically opposed to the
    ideas of those modern moralists who reject his supernaturalism and salvationalism. The
    injunction &quot;Take no thought for the morrow&quot; is incompatible with
    &quot;Preparedness&quot;, insurance and any other practice involving foresight. The
    command to break off all family and social relationships is similarly unethical. The
    truth, of course, is that these instructions were given to a select body of men, not to
    the world at large. Renunciation of the world is the first step toward spiritual
    illumination, and in the East, from the beginning of recorded time to the present day, the
    yogi, the fakir, the bhikkhu and the monk take this course, expecting that the piety of
    their neighbours will supply them with a means of livelihood.</p>
    <p>It is not only illogical to pick out of the gospels the texts which happen to suit
    one's own prejudices and then claim Christ as the supreme teacher, hut his claims to
    pre-eminence are barred by the fact that all passages which are not fiendish superstition
    find parallels in the writings of earlier masters. The works of Lao Tzu, the Buddhist
    cannon, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud and the philosophy of many of the
    early Greeks, to say nothing of the sacred books of Egypt, contain the whole of</p>
    <p>{145}</p>
    <p>the metaphysics, theology and ethics to which modern enlightenment can assent. It is
    monstrous and mschevious for liberal thinkers to call themselves Christians; their nominal
    adhesion delays the disruption of the infamous system which they condone. To declare
    oneself a follower of Jesus is not only to insult history and reason but to apologize for
    the murderers of Arius, Molinos and Cranmer, the persecutors of science, the upholders of
    slavery and the suppressors of all free thought and speech.</p>
    <p>At this time I had not carried these arguments to their logical conclusion. <em>The
    Cloud upon the Sanctuary</em> told me of a secret community of saints in possession of
    every spiritual grace, of the keys to the treasurers of nature, and of moral emancipation
    such that there was no intolerance of unkindness. The members of this Church lived their
    secret life of sanctity in the world, radiating light and love upon all that came within
    their scope, yet they were free from spiritual pride. They enjoyed intimate communion with
    the immanent divine soul of nature. Inheritors of innocence and illumination, they were
    not self-seekers; and their one passion was to bring mankind into the sphere of their own
    sublimity, dealing with each individual as his circumstances required. To them the members
    of the Trinity were nearer and more real than anything else in the universe. But they were
    pure ideas of incorruptible integrity. The incarnation was a mystical or magical operation
    which took place in every man. Each was himself the Son of God who had assumed a body of
    flesh and blood in order to perform the work of redemption. The in-dwelling of the Holy
    Ghost was a sanctification resulting from the completion of the great work when the self
    had been crucified to itself and raised again in incorruptible immortality.</p>
    <p>I did not yet see that this conception reposed on metaphysical bases as untenable as
    those of orthodoxy. There was no attempt to explain the origin of evil and similar
    difficulties. But these things were mysteries which would be revealed to the saint as he
    advanced in the way of grace. Anyhow, I was certainly not the person to cavil. The
    sublimity of the idea enthralled me; it satisfied my craving for romance and poetry. I
    determined with my whole heart to make myself worthy to attract the notice of this
    mysterious brotherhood. I yearned passionately for illumination. I could imagine nothing
    more exquisite than to enter into communion with these holy men and to acquire the power
    of communicating with the angelic and divine intelligence of the universe. I longed for
    perfect purity of life, for mastery of the secret forces of nature, and for a career of
    devoted labour on behalf of &quot;the Creation which groaneth and travaileth&quot;.</p>
    <p>My poetry at this time is charged to the highest point with these aspirations. I may
    mention the dedication to <em>Songs of the Spirit</em>, &quot;The Quest&quot;, &quot;The
    Alchemist&quot;, &quot;The Philosopher's Progress&quot;, &quot;A Spring Snowstorm in
    WAstdale&quot;, &quot;Succubus&quot;, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, &quot;The Storm&quot;,
    &quot;Wheat and Wine&quot;, &quot;Vespers&quot;,</p>
    <p>{146}</p>
    <p>&quot;Astrology&quot; and &quot;Daedalus&quot;. In &quot;the Farewell of Paracelsus to
    Aprile&quot;, &quot;The Initiation&quot;, &quot;Isaiah&quot; and &quot;Power&quot;, I have
    expressed my ideas about the ordeals which might be expected on the Path. All these poems
    were published in 1898. In later volumes, <em>Mysteries Lyrical and Dramatic</em>, <em>The
    Fatal Force</em>, <em>The Temple of the Holy Ghost</em> and <em>Tannhäuser</em>, these
    ideas are carried further in the light of my practical experience of the Path.</p>
    <p>It may seem strange that, despite the yearning after sanctification, which is the
    keynote of these works, I never lost sight of what seems on the surface the incompatible
    idea of justification by sin. &quot;Jezebel&quot; and the other poems in that volume prove
    this point. It is as if my unconscious were aware that every act is a sacrament and that
    the most repulsive rituals might be in some ways the most effective. The only adequate way
    of overcoming evil was to utilize it fully as a means of grace. Religion was for me a
    passionate reality of the most positive kind. Virtue is etymologically manhood. Virility,
    creative conception and enthusiastic execution were the means of attainment. There could
    be no merit in abstention from vice. Vice indeed is <em>vitium</em>, a flaw or defect.</p>
    <p>This attitude is not antinomianism, as the word is usually understood. When St. Paul
    said, &quot;All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient&quot;, he only
    went half way. One ought to leave no form of energy to rust. Every particle of one's
    personality is a necessary factor in the equation and every impulse must be turned to
    account in the Great Work. I perceived, moreover, that all conventional rules of conduct
    were valid only in relation to environment. To take a fundamental issue: selfpreservation.
    On the theory of reincarnation or that of immortality, there should be no more objection
    to dying than there is to going to sleep. In any case, I realized that my physical life
    was utterly valueless; and I did not set it at a pin's fee.</p>
    <p>I have never been afraid of carrying into effect my conclusions; and I knew, what is
    more, that to fail to do so would be merely to create a conflict in myself. I had a
    thorough instinctive understanding of the theory of psychoanalysis. The this fact I
    attribute my extraordinary success in all my spiritual undertakings, From the very
    beginning I made a point of carrying out the instructions of one of the old Grimoires
    &quot;to buy a black egg without haggling&quot;. I always understood that spiritual and
    material wealth were incommensurable. If I wanted a book on Magick and it was offered me
    for ten times the proper price, I would buy it on the spot, even though I knew that I had
    only to go round the corner to find an honest tradesman.</p>
    <p>I did this sort of thing on purpose to affirm magically that nothing mattered except
    the work of the moment. It was &quot;Take not thought for the morrow&quot; carried out in
    its most literal sense. I made a point of putting God on His honour, so to speak, to
    supply anything I might need by demonstrating to</p>
    <p>{147}</p>
    <p>him that I would not keep back the least imaginable fraction of my resources. I
    acquired this custom later on, when I had definitely discovered the direction of my
    destiny; but the moral basis of my attitude was already present. The first important
    indication of its incidence is given by the outcome of my friendship with Pollitt.</p>
    <p>He was in residence during the Easter term of 1898 and we saw each other almost every
    day. In the vacation he accompanied me to Wastdale Head and used to walk with me over the
    fells, thought I could never persuade him to do any rock climbing.</p>
    <p>I was absorbed in <em>The Cloud upon the Sanctuary</em>, reading it again and again
    without being put off by the pharisaical, priggish and pithecanthropoid notes of its
    translator, Madame de Steiger. I appealed with the whole force of my will to the adepts of
    the Hidden Church to prepare me as postulant for their august company. As will be seen
    later, acts of will, performed by the proper person, never fall to the ground, impossible
    as it is (at present) to understand by what means the energy is transmitted.</p>
    <p>Although Pollitt had done so much for my education by introducing me to the actual
    atmosphere of current aesthetic ideas, to the work of Whistler, Rops and Beardsley in art,
    and that of the so-called decadents in literature, as well as to many remote and exquisite
    masters of the past whom I had ignored or misunderstood, my admiration and gratitude did
    not prevent me from becoming conscious of the deep-seated aversion of our souls. He had
    made no mistake in divining that my spiritual aspirations were hostile to his acquiescence
    in despair of the universe. So I felt in my subconscious self that I must choose between
    my devotion to him and to the Secret Assembly of the Saints. Though he was actual and
    adequate, I preferred to risk all on the hazard. Human friendship, ideal as it was in this
    case, was under the curse of the universal sorrow. I determined deliberately to give it
    up, notwithstanding that it was unique and adorable in its way; that there was no
    reasonable hope of replacing it. This was my act of faith, unalloyed with the dross of
    hope, and stamped with the imperial countenance of love, to determine that I would not
    continue our relations.</p>
    <p>The poignancy of this resolution was jagged and envenomed; for he was the only person
    with whom I had ever enjoyed truly spiritual intercourse and my heart was lonely, hungry
    and embittered as only a poet's heart can understand. This determination developed
    gradually during that last May term. He fought most desperately against my increasing
    preoccupation with the aspiration in which he recognized the executioner of our
    friendship.</p>
    <p>Shortly after I went down, we had a last interview. I had gone down to the Bear at
    Maidenhead, on the quiet, to write &quot;Jezebel&quot;. I only told one person --- in
    strict confidence --- where I was going; but Pollitt found out that person and forced him
    to tell my secret. He walked into the room shortly after</p>
    <p>{148}</p>
    <p>dinner, to my surprise and rage --- for when I am writing a poem I would show Azrael
    himself the door!</p>
    <p>I told him frankly and firmly that I had given my life to religion and that he did not
    fit into the scheme. I see now how imbecile I was, how hideously wrong and weak it is to
    reject any part of one's personality. Yet these mistakes are not mistakes at the time: one
    has to pass through such periods; one must be ruthless in analysis and complete it, before
    one can proceed to synthesis. He understood that I was not to be turned from my purpose
    and we parted, never to meet again. I repented of my decision, my eyes having been
    enlightened, on a little later, but the reconciliation was not written! My letter
    miscarried; and in the autumn, when he passed me in Bond Street, I happened not to see
    him; he thought I meant to cut him and our destinies drew apart.</p>
    <p>It has been my lifelong regret, for a nobler and purer comradeship never existed on
    this earth, and his influence might have done much to temper my subsequent trials.
    Nevertheless, the fragrance of that friendship still lingers in the sanctuary of my soul.
    That eucharist of the spirit reminds me constantly that the one ingredient necessary to my
    aesthetic development was supplied by the gods at the one period in my life when it could
    profitably be introduced into my equipment.</p>
