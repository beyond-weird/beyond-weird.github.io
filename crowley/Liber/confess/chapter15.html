    <p>I must not omit to mention the first descent of the west face of the Trifthorn. It was
    early in the season of '96. Going up to Zermatt in the train I met an English climber whom
    I will call Arthur Ellis. He was anxious to do guideless work and we agreed to try a few
    mountains together. We made some minor expeditions and he proved highly competent. One day
    we climbed the Trifthorn by the ordinary route, with the idea of attempting the traverse.
    As I was to go down last, he was carrying the rucksack with our provisions. We made
    several attempts to find a way down the Zinal face; but always the slopes steepened until
    it became evident that they pitched over, and we had to retrace our steps. Ellis, however,
    was very annoyed at my caution and wanted to glissade, which was a proposal about as
    reasonable as jumping off the Eiffel Tower. Presently he made an excuse for taking off the
    rope and retired behind a rock while I sat down and lit my pipe. I was aroused by a hail.
    Ellis was three or four hundred feet down the slope! He urged me once more to glissade. He
    said he had invented a new method of exercising this art, which was to hold the axe by the
    shaft and use the pick as a brake. It was downright insanity; and took me absolutely by
    surprise, as previously he had been a sound and careful climber. I could do nothing to
    restrain him: I tried to humour him and suggested that he should &quot;come up to where I
    was and start fair&quot;. But he wasn't taking any and let himself go. A few seconds later
    he was performing cartwheels and then disappeared over the edge. The angle was such that I
    could not see where he had fallen. I hastily climbed a convenient rock pinnacle. Then I
    saw him. He was lying, spreadeagled, in the Bergschrund, with his blood staining the snow;
    which, by the way, ought not to have been there, and would not have been but for the
    continuous bad weather.</p>
    <p>The task before me was hardly prepossessing. It was up to me to find my way alone down
    a face which had never previously been climbed. However, I discovered a route which took
    me to the glacier in about five hours. At one point I was obliged to lower myself down by
    the rope; and, as I could not unhitch it, I was thrown more than ever on my own resources
    after that. On several occasions I was obliged to make some very risky jumps, so that I
    might have been cut off if I had found a passage beyond my powers.</p>
    <p>I must admit feeling considerable disgust at seeing Ellis making his way over the
    glacier as if nothing had happened. He had fallen some eight hundred feet, the last three
    hundred sheer drop. I was utterly exhausted and</p>
    <p>{130}</p>
    <p>badly in need of food. It was all I could do to catch up to him. The only damage he had
    suffered was a trifling cut on one leg! Nightfall was at hand; and though the hut was not
    very far off in actual distance, we had a terrible time getting there, having to wade
    through soft snow up to our waits. The hut was <em>bewirtshaftet</em>; but the guardian
    had not come up in consequence of the weather, so we had to force our way in and break
    into the provision room in order to get fuel and the like.</p>
    <p>Our adventures were not yet over. My clothes were (naturally) dripping, I threw my coat
    on the table, above which hung my Alpine lamp. This type of lamp has a hole in the bottom
    through which a candle is thrust. It is held in place by a spring. I threw myself on the
    straw, being too tired to complete the operation of going to bed without a few moments'
    rest. I felt sleep overcoming me, knew it was my duty to put out the candle, but began to
    argue that even if it did drop out the fall would extinguish it, or if not, the wet coat
    would do so. It was a perfectly good argument; but the one chance in a million came off
    --- it didn't go out till my coat was burnt to cinders.</p>
    <p>Luckily, the next morning the guardian of the hut came up. I borrowed his coat and went
    down to Evolena, where my baggage had been sent. Ellis was not fit to be moved and I
    arranged to come up two days later and fetch him. At Evolena I got a change of clothes and
    sent up the guide's coat by a porter.</p>
    <p>Now, in the hotel was a girls' school, being conducted to admire the wonders and
    beauties of nature. The following day they came down in the afternoon from the glacier,
    very excited at having found the tracks of a chamois on the mule path. I knew, of course,
    that this was hallucination and thought no more of it. Just before dinner I was outside
    the hotel taking the air, when I saw in the distance a solitary figure slowly approaching.
    Its action was very peculiar, I thought.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The wild man wends his weary way<br>
          To a strange and lonely pump.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yet it seemed somehow familiar. It drew nigh; yes, it was Arthur Ellis. I expressed
    surprise; but he said that he had felt so much better he thought he might as well come
    down, but it had been a long and terrible day. He had started at dawn. This was absurd, as
    it was only a couple of hours' easy walking from the hut. Ah yes, he said, but he had come
    down over the snout of the glacier and he had had to cut steps all the way --- no more
    glissading for him! This story was again rather incredible. But his axe had been
    tremendously knocked about. The truth slowly dawned on my benighted brain: he had solemnly
    cut his way down the mule path --- he was the chamois whose tracks the girls had seen!</p>
    <p>Well, it was not time for me to join my friends at Arolla; but I</p>
    <p>{131}</p>
    <p>wasn't going to climb any more with Ellis, so I made my excuses and departed.</p>
    <p>The fag-end of the story is as peculiar as the rest. We arranged to dine together in
    London and when I got back I wrote to him. He replied at once, asking me to dine with him
    at his club. I duly turned up; but he was not there and I have never heard a word of him
    since!</p>
    <p>Another very amusing incident occurred at Arolla. A little way above the old hotel is a
    large boulder, which had never been climbed from the hotel side. I spent some time before
    I found out how to do it. One had to traverse the face to the right, with a minimum of
    hand hold and foot hold, until one came to a place where the slope eased off. But this
    point was defended by a bulge in the rock which threw one out. It was just possible for a
    very slim man with a prehensile abdomen. But it was a matter of a quarter of an ounce one
    way or the other whether the friction grips were sufficient or not. It was one of the most
    difficult pieces of rock climbing I had ever tackled.</p>
    <p>I decided to have some fun with it and taught a girl how to do it. I then offered a
    hundred francs to any guide who could get up. We got together a little party one afternoon
    and I proceeded to show off. Several other people tried, but without success. I began to
    mock them and said, &quot;But this is absurd --- you fellows can't climb at all --- it's
    quite easy --- why, I'd back a girl to do it --- won't you have a try, Miss
    So-and-so?&quot; My pupil played up beautifully and pretended to need a lot of persuasion.
    Ultimately, she offered to try if she were held on a rope from above. I said,
    &quot;Nonsense, you can do it perfectly well by yourself!&quot; The company protested that
    she would kill herself; and she pretended to be put on her mettle, refused all help and
    swarmed up in great style.</p>
    <p>This made everybody very much ashamed. Even the guides were stung into trying it. But
    nobody else got up. So I started to coach them on the rope. Several succeeded with the
    moral support and without being hauled. A fair number, however, came off and looked rather
    ridiculous, dangling. People began the urge the chaplain to try his hand. He didn't like
    it at all; but he came to me and said he would go if I would be very careful to manage the
    rope so that he did not look ridiculous, because of the respect due to his cloth. I
    promised him that I would attend to the matter with the utmost conscientiousness. I
    admitted that I had purposely made fun of some of the others, but that in his case I would
    tie the rope properly; not under his arms but just above the hips.</p>
    <p>Having thus arranged for the respect due to his cloth, I went to the top of the rock
    and sat sufficiently far back to be unable to see what was happening on the face. When he
    came off, as the rope was fastened so low, he turned upside down. I pretended to
    misunderstand and jerked him up and down for several minutes before finally hauling him
    up, purple in the face and covered</p>
    <p>{132}</p>
    <p>with scratches. I had not failed in the respect due to his cloth. But quite a number of
    people were sufficiently lacking in taste to laugh at him.</p>
    <p>One day I took my cousin Gregor, who by this time was married and had discovered that
    his life was not worth keeping. We made the second ascent of the north-north-east ridge of
    Mont Collon. It is a long and severe climb. The conditions were very bad and Gregor was
    quite unequal to this class of climbing, so that I had to pull him up most of the way. We
    were very late on the mountain in consequence. I had no idea of the best way down, but
    decided to try the short and precipitous route which leads to the level glacier above the
    Vuibez S&#130;racs. The descent of a difficult mountain is always awkward when the second
    man is not up to the mark. He cannot go down last because of the danger; and in going down
    first he is pretty sure to take the wrong road, wherever he cannot be guided by voice.
    However, we got down the steep part, safely enough, just before dark.</p>
    <p>We took off the rope to descend some slopes covered with loose rock. As I sat down to
    coil the rope I realized that I was completely exhausted, though mentally rather than
    physically. My brain played me a curious trick. Gregor had reached a patch of broken rocks
    at the bottom of the slope and I followed him slowly. Suddenly I saw a troll, one of those
    funny little dwarfs with pointed caps and formidable beards that one sees pictured in
    German fairy stories and on beer mugs (<em>Heinzelmännchen</em> appears to be the
    official name). This creature was hopping about the rocks in a very jovial way. He
    appeared quite real in every respect. For instance, he was not transparent. But it never
    occurred to me to believe in him. I put him down to cerebral fatigue. The apparition only
    lasted for a few minutes. He was gone before I rejoined my cousin.</p>
    <p>It would, of course, have been madness to attempt to cross the glacier that night, the
    snow being very deep and soft, so we managed as best we could to keep warm. I did not
    sleep very much --- it was my first night out. In the morning we ran across the frozen
    snow to the little pass which leads down to the valley. We had hardly crossed it when we
    met a rescue party sent up by the dear old hotel keeper, Anzevui, who had a curious
    personal affection for me as the bad boy of the valley who was always making things
    interesting. Our descent had been watched through glasses; and they had come to the
    conclusion that we must have met with an accident, because our route down the mountain was
    an original variation of the regular way and supposed to be impossible. We had, in fact,
    met with one exceedingly bad pitch where I was glad of the hitched rope.</p>
    <p>On another occasion I was benighted; it was with Morris Travers and his younger brother
    on the Aiguilles Rouges, owing to our extreme conscientiousness in climbing every pinnacle
    accurately and the breakdown of the younger Travers from fatigue. It was one more example
    of the disadvantage</p>
    <p>{133}</p>
    <p>of a third man. A party of two would have finished the climb at least three hours
    earlier. A bitterly cold wind was blowing from the north-west, so that we could not pass
    the night on the ridge or on that side of it. We had to find shelter on the eastern face.
    It was too dark to get down the cliffs, even if young Travers had been equal to the
    effort, and they were very steep. There was not even a reasonable ledge.</p>
    <p>However, we found a chimney where the boy could rest in moderate comfort and there was
    a sort of shelf which accommodated his brother. As for me, the best repose I could find
    was to wedge myself across the chimney with one foot, my back against a steep patch of
    now; the warmth of my body melted this and the water trickled down. As my knickerbockers
    had been torn to pieces on the rock, there was a certain degree of discomfort connected
    with my night's rest and the strain on my leg somehow damaged the knee joint, which used
    continually to give trouble for years afterwards. But I was so tired that I went to sleep
    with my pipe in my mouth. It is extraordinary that I did not fall --- the pipe did.</p>
