    <p>When I went up to Cambridge in the October term of 1895, I had the sensation of drawing
    a long deep breath as one does after swimming under water or (an even better analogy) as
    one does after bracing oneself against the pain inflicted by a dentist. I could not
    imagine anything better in life. I found myself suddenly in an entirely new world. I was
    part of the glories of the past; and I made a firm resolution to be one of the glories of
    the future. I should like the haunted room over the Great Gate of Trinity to be turned
    into a vault like that of Christian Rosencreutz to receive my sarcophagus. I must admit
    that I don't know of much else in England of the works of man which I would not make haste
    to destroy if the opportunity occurred. But Trinity, except New Court and Whewell's Court,
    is enough for nay poet to live and die for.</p>
    <p>I remember being amazed in later years when my patriotism was doubted. I wasn't going
    to have &quot;<em>Eintritt Verboten</em>&quot; put up over the Great Gate with a Prussian
    sentry to enforce it. I am perfectly aware that I am irrational. The traditions of England
    are intertwined inextricably with a million abuses and deformities which I am only too
    eager to destroy. But all Englishmen keep their brains in watertight compartments. It
    would be a comic degradation of make Trinity the headquarters of the Rationalist Press
    Association. But at the time I had not seen the logical incompatibility of my various
    positions. Shakespeare's patriotism in John of Gaunt's dying speech and <em>Henry V</em>
    appeals directly to my poetic sense.</p>
    <p>I am quite prepared to die for England in that brutal, unthinking way. &quot;Rule,
    Britannia&quot; gets me going as if I were the most ordinary music-hall audience. This
    sentiment is not interfered with by my detestation of the moral and religious humbug which
    one is expected to produce at moments of national crisis. My patriotism is of the blatant,
    unintelligent variety, popularized by Kipling. I like the old rime:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Two skinny Frenchmen, one Portugee,<br>
          One jolly Englishmen lick 'em all three.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But I can find no moral excuse for my attitude. I am an animal with a family and a
    country. To hell with everybody! This animal is prepared to use its brains and its force
    as stupidly and unscrupulously as the Duke of Wellington. It is not convinced by its own
    philosophical opinions, which condemn patriotism as parochialism, regard war as immoral
    savagery and economic</p>
    <p>{107}</p>
    <p>insanity, and consider public opinion and its leaders as the bleating of sheep,
    huddling into their fold at the barking of mongrel dogs.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere of Cambridge formed an admirable background for my state of mind. I saw
    myself as a romantic character in history. The Church of England, as represented by my
    Uncle Tom, had seemed a narrow tyranny, as detestable as that of the Plymouth Brethren;
    less logical and more hypocritical. My Uncle Jonathan was a sound churchman; but he kept
    his religion to himself and went his own triumphant way in the world, keeping
    ecclesiastical discipline at arm's length as far as he himself was concerned. He was prima
    facie one of the saved, whenever he troubled to think about it, no doubt; but in practice
    the Church of England was simply a machine for keeping the lower classes in their proper
    place. At Trinity it was the same thing. Christianity was the official religion with which
    it was convenient to comply, just as it is convenient to go to a good tailor. It was, in
    short, a political paganism.</p>
    <p>I don't suppose that I appreciated this fact at the time, in that way. My attitude was
    determined by the unquestionable beauty of ecclesiastical architecture and the comparative
    dignity of the ritual. But when I discovered that chapel was compulsory I immediately
    struck back. The junior dean halled me for not attending chapel, which I was certainly not
    going to do, because it involved early rising. I excused myself on the ground that I had
    been brought up among the Plymouth Brethren. The dean asked me to come and see him
    occasionally and discuss the matter, and I had the astonishing impudence to write to him
    that &quot;The seed planted by my father, watered by my mother's tears, would prove too
    hardy a growth to be uprooted even by his eloquence and learning&quot;. It sounds like the
    most despicable hypocrisy, but it was pretty good cheek, and I had made up my mind that I
    would not be interfered with. I regarded any attempt to control my actions as an
    impertinent intrusion and I was not going to waste time in taking any but the easiest way
    out.</p>
    <p>I entered for the Moral Science Tripos with the idea that it would help me to learn
    something about the nature of things. I don't know why it should have interested me. It
    must have been my subconscious will speaking. In any case, I was profoundly disgusted to
    find that political economy was one of the subjects. I attended the first lecture; the
    professor told us that the subject was a very difficult one because there were no reliable
    data. It is easy to imagine the effect of such a statement on a boy who had been trained
    in the exactitude of mathematics and chemistry. I closed my notebook and never attended
    another lecture. My tutor naturally called me to account, but by great good fortune he was
    a man of extraordinary ability --- Dr. A. W. Verrall. He accepted my plea that my business
    in life was to study English literature. He was, indeed, most sympathetic. He knew only
    too well that the university curriculum</p>
    <p>{108}</p>
    <p>afforded no opportunities. He knew, too, that my school knowledge was amply sufficient
    to take me through the university examinations without my doing any work for them. In
    fact, during my three years I only did one day's work for the university, and that
    consisted in employing a boy to read through a translation of a Greek play while I
    followed it in the text. I got either a first or second class in every subject.</p>
    <p>One of the dons at Pembroke, a clergyman named Heriz Smith, ran a sort of secret cult
    which was disrespectfully called by outsiders the Belly- banders. There were said to be
    seven degrees of initiation, in the highest of which the candidate was flagellated. I took
    the first degree out of curiosity. It made so little impression on me that I have
    altogether forgotten what took place. I remember that I was alone in the man's room with
    him. He blindfolded me. I waited for something to happen; it did not. I was, of course,
    utterly unable to divine what purpose might lie behind the scheme. It was, of course,
    looked upon as cant by the man's own colleagues, who probably presumed certain undesirable
    features.</p>
    <p>I am rather sorry now that I did not continue. There may have been nothing in it beyond
    sensuous mysticism, but for all I know Heriz Smith may have developed a method of
    psycho-analysis of quite possibly great value. I am inclined to think that the most
    scientific and reliable way of exploring people's unconscious minds would be to watch
    their reaction to a well-thought-out series of unfamiliar circumstances. One could compare
    their respective qualities, such as will-power, patience, dignity, courage,
    imperturbability, and so on. Such data should be of great use in answering the question,
    &quot;Werewithal shall a young man mend his ways?&quot;</p>
    <p>I was very put out by finding, as a first year man, that Hall was at half-past eight. I
    objected to my evenings being cut into by dining so late and soon acquired the habit of
    having all meals sent in from the kitchen. I was thus almost totally dissociated from the
    corporate life of the college. The only institution which interested me was the debating
    society, the Magpie and Stump. But I could not take even this seriously. It seemed to me
    absurd for these young asses to emit their callow opinions on important subjects. I was
    only interested in &quot;rag&quot; debates. I remember on one occasion that the suggestion
    had been made by a committee inspired by one of the tutors, the eminent mathematician, W.
    W. Rouse Ball, to establish a junior common-room. My contribution to the discussion was to
    say that &quot;this proposal seems to me to be all Ball's.&quot; (An even happier moment
    was in a debate on a proposal to institute a passion play in England, when Lord Kilmarnock
    said that it would certainly be a popular attraction to hear Arthur Roberts say &quot;I
    thirst.&quot;)</p>
    <p>My three years were determined by the influence of a fourth year man named Adamson,
    whom I think I met at the chess club. He started to talk to</p>
    <p>{109}</p>
    <p>me about English literature. For the first time I heard the name Shelley. <em>Wie
    gesagt, so gethan</em>. Nothing else seemed to me worth while but a thorough reading of
    the great minds of the past. I bought all the classical authors. Whenever I found a
    reference of one to another I hastened to order his works. I spent the whole of my time in
    reading. It was very rare that I got to bed before daylight. But I had a horror of being
    thought a &quot;smug&quot;; and what I was doing was a secret from my nearest friends.
    Whenever they were about I was playing chess and cards. In the daytime I went canoeing or
    cycling. I had no occupations which brought me into close touch with any great body of
    undergraduates. I even gave up the habit of going round to see people, though I was always
    at home to anyone who chose to call. I was not interested in the average man; I cultivated
    the freak. It was not that I liked abnormal people, it was simply the scientific attitude
    that it is from the abnormal that we learn.</p>
    <p>Most people of this disposition are readily carried away into antisocial channels. But
    with me this was not the case. I dropped my subscription to the boat club because I was
    getting nothing out of it; but I was always wildly enthusiastic about the success of the
    boat. I have always had a passionate yearning for mankind, wholesale and retail, but I
    cannot endure to have them anywhere around. It is a very peculiar psychology; yet it is
    frequently found among poets. We are lonely and suffer intensely on that account. We are
    prepared to love any and every specimen of humanity in himself, for himself, and by
    himself; but even a dinner party gets on our nerves.</p>
    <p>It is perhaps part of the psychology of sensitiveness. We cannot bear having our
    corners knocked off, and at the same time we are so well aware of the intense suffering of
    isolation that we long to lose ourselves in a crowd at a football match. I can be
    perfectly happy as an unknown individual in a revel, from a political meeting to a masked
    ball; but inevitably one's unique qualities draw attention to one; the cruel consciousness
    of self is reawakened, one becomes utterly miserable and flees to the ends of the earth to
    be rid of one's admirers. A certain coarseness is inseparable from popularity and one is
    therefore constantly driven away from the very thing one needs most. It is a
    quasi-electrical phenomenon. One can only find satisfaction in intimate union with one's
    opposite.</p>
    <p>This fact explains very largely the peculiar nature of the love affair of great men.
    They cannot tolerate their like. Their superiority is recognized as the cause of their
    pain, and they assuage their pain by cultivating people to whom that superiority means
    nothing. They deliberately seek the most degraded and disgusting specimens of women that
    exist. Otherwise, they brutalize themselves by addiction to drink and drugs. The motive is
    always the same; to lose consciousness of their Promethean pangs.</p>
    <p>I must here point out that the social system of England makes it impossible</p>
    <p>{110}</p>
    <p>for a young man of spirit and intelligence to satisfy his nature with regard to sex in
    any reasonable way. The young girl of position similar to his own is being fattened for
    the market. Even when his own situation makes it possible for him to obtain her he has to
    pay an appalling price; and it becomes more difficult than ever for him to enjoy female
    companionship. Monogyny is nonsense for any one with a grain of imagination. The more
    sides he has to his nature, the more women he needs to satisfy it. The same is, of course,
    true, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, of women. A woman risks her social existence by a single
    experiment. A young man is compelled by the monogamic system to develop his character by
    means of corrupt society vampires or women of the lower classes, and though he may learn a
    great deal from these sources, it cannot but be unfortunate that he has no opportunity to
    learn from women of his own birth, breeding, education and rank in society.</p>
    <p>Now, monogamy has very little to do with mongyny; and should have less. Monogamy is
    only a mistake because it leaves the excess women unsatisfied and unprovided for. But
    apart from this, it provides for posterity, and it is generally recognized that this is
    the crux of all practical arguments on the subject. But the defect of monogamy, as
    generally understood, is that it is connected with the sexual appetite. The Practical
    Wisdom of the Astrologers has made this clear. The Fifth House (love, children) has
    nothing to do with the Seventh (marriage, lawsuits, public enemies). Marriage would lead
    to very little trouble if men would get rid of the idea that it is anything more than a
    financial and social partnership. People should marry for convenience and agree to go
    their separate ways without jealousy. It should be a point of honour for the woman to
    avoid complicating the situation with children by other men, unless her husband be
    willing, which he would be if he really loved her. It is monstrous for a man to pretend to
    be devoted to securing his wife's happiness and yet to wish to deprive her of a woman's
    supreme joy: that of bearing a child to the man whom she desires sexually, and is
    therefore indicated by nature as the proper father, though he may be utterly unsuitable as
    a husband. In most cases this would be so, for it must obviously be rare that a man with a
    genius for paternity should also possess a talent for domesticity. We have heard a great
    deal in recent years of the freedom of women. They have gained what they thought they
    wanted and it has availed them nothing. They must adopt the slogan, &quot;There shall be
    no property in human flesh.&quot; They must train men to master their sexual selfishness,
    while of course allowing them the same freedom as they themselves will enjoy. The true
    offences against marriage arise when sexual freedom results in causing injury to the
    health or estate of the partner. But the sentimental wrong of so-called infidelity is a
    symptom of the childishness of the race.</p>
    <p>Among artists, the system here advocated has always been more or less in full swing.
    Such societies exist in circumstances highly inimical to a</p>
    <p>{111}</p>
    <p>satisfactory life. Financial considerations alone make this obvious; yet it is
    notorious that such people are almost uniformly happy. There is no revolt against the
    facts of life, because there is no constraint. The individual is respected as such and is
    allowed to act as he or she likes without penalty or even reproach. Only when selfish or
    commercial considerations arise do we find catastrophe.</p>
    <p>It is commonly supposed that women themselves are the chief obstacle to such an
    arrangement. But this is only because they have been drilled in to thinking that the
    happiness and well-being of the children depend upon their supporting the existing system.
    When you tackle a woman on the subject she pretends to be very shocked; and hysterically
    denies the most obvious facts. But she wilts under cross-examination and agrees with the
    above conclusions in a very short time. For women have no morality in the sense of the
    world which is ordinarily understood in Anglo-Saxondom. Women never let ideals interfere
    with their practical good sense. They are also influenced by selfishness; it is natural to
    them to put the interests of their children before their own. Men, on the other hand, are
    hard to convince. When forced to analyse the situation, they arrive not at a reason but at
    a prejudice, and this is purely the brainless bestial lust for exclusive possession.</p>
    <p>Anthropology proves these theorems thoroughly. The first step in civilization is to
    restrain women from infidelity. The institutions of the pardah, sati and the marriage laws
    all show that men think that women must be kept under lock and key, whereas women have
    always realized that it is impossible and undesirable to prevent men from taking their
    happiness where they find it. The emancipation of women, therefore, depends entirely upon
    leaving them free to act as men do. Their good sense will prevent them from inflicting the
    real wrongs; and besides, their complete independence and happiness will encourage them in
    nobility and generosity.</p>
    <p>We already see, in America, the results of the emancipation of women from the economic
    fetter. There is an immense class of bachelor girls (and of married women whose husbands
    are strictly business machines) who pick up men with the same nonchalance as the young
    &quot;blood&quot; picked up women in my time at Cambridge.</p>
    <p>I found myself, from the very beginning of my university career, urged by circumstances
    of every sort to indulge my passion in every way but the right one. My ill-health had
    prevented me from taking part in the ordinary amusements of the public school boy. My
    skill in avoiding corporal punishment and my lack of opportunity for inflicting it had
    saved me from developing the sadistic or masochistic sides to my character. But at
    Cambridge I discovered that I was of an intensely passionate nature, physiologically
    speaking. My poetic instincts, further, transformed the most sordid</p>
    <p>{112}</p>
    <p>liaisons into romance, so that the impossibility of contracting a suitable and serious
    relation did not worry me. I found, moreover, that any sort of satisfaction acted as a
    powerful spiritual stimulus. Every adventure was the direct cause of my writing poetry. In
    the periods of suppression my brain had been completely clogged; I was as incapable of
    thought of any kind as if I had had the toothache.</p>
    <p>I have a genuine grudge against the system on this account. Whole months of my life,
    which might have been profitably spent in all sorts of work, were taken up by the morbid
    broodings of the unsatisfied appetite. Repression is as mentally unwholesome as
    constipation, and I am furious, to this hour, that some of the best years of my life,
    which should have been spent in acquiring knowledge, were sterilized by the suffocating
    stupor of preoccupation with sex. It was not that my mind was working on the subject; it
    was simply unable to work. It was a blind, horrible ache for relief. The necessities of
    men in this respect vary enormously. I was, no doubt, an exceptional case. But I certainly
    found even forty-eight hours of abstinence sufficient to dull the fine edge of my mind.
    Woe unto them by whom offences come! The stupidity of having had to waste uncounted
    priceless hours in chasing what ought to have been brought to the back door every evening
    with the milk!</p>
    <p>Cambridge is, of course, an ideal place for a boy in my situation. Prostitution is to
    all intents and purposes non-existent, but nearly all the younger women of the district
    are eager to co-operate in the proper spirit --- that of romance and passion.</p>
    <p>There is thus little trace of public school <em>faute de mieux</em> paederasty: it
    survives only in very small &quot;aesthetic&quot; coteries, composed mostly of congenital
    perverts, and in theological circles, where fear of scandal and of disease inhibit natural
    gratification. Oxford, of course, is different, chiefly, I believe, owing to the great
    Balliol tradition of statesmanship. The idea seems to be that intrigues with women are
    more dangerous than useful to a rising politician: while on the other side of the fence
    the state of the law supplies one with a pull on one's intimates on the Bench or in the
    Privy Council which is only the stronger because it is not, and never can be, used.</p>
