    <p>My precise motive in going to Paris eludes me. I seem to have acted upon general
    principles. My visit proved eventful. Firstly, I met a man named Sullivan, &quot;a fellow
    almost damned with a fair wife&quot; named Sylvia. They had been married some time and she
    had developed a pain in the old place. A friend of hers asked my advice. I gave it, not
    suspecting the object of her solicitude. The situation suddenly developed by Sylvia and
    myself starting trouble.</p>
    <p>Sullivan came of the people. His brilliant brain had pulled him up to the position of
    &quot;mathematical and scientific reviewer&quot; for <em>The Times</em> and the <em>Athenaeum</em>,
    besides casual contributions to various papers. Absorbed in his work, he had no taste in
    common with Sylvia bar music, and he had begun to find it rather a nuisance to have to
    trail her along at his heels. He asked me point-blank to take her off his hands for a
    time. As in the case of Ratan Devi I was glad to oblige. He could have her back when he
    liked by whistling for her.</p>
    <p>The dialogue reverted after this short digression to the subject that enthralled us ---
    <em>The Book of the Law</em>. I astounded his science by setting forth the facts of its
    origin, and the evidence of its contents that the author possessed the key to several
    problems insoluble by any intellect hitherto incarnate. We talked day and night for a
    fortnight. On his part, he showed me a great many mysteries in <em>The Book of the Law</em>
    that I had not suspected till then. I may indeed say that more than once he asked me some
    questions on a subject of which I was quite ignorant, and that on searching <em>The Book
    of the Law</em> I discovered a satisfactory reply in a text whose meaning had escaped me
    through my ignorance of the subject in question.</p>
    <p>Our conversation was uninterrupted except for the tyranny of sleep and Sylvia. She
    became pregnant, a complication necessitating a further brief digression. It was agreed
    that she should return to Cefalu with me, he to join us and work out fully the
    mathematical theories of <em>The Book of the Law</em> as the convenience of his editor
    permitted. After Sylvia's confinement, we would confer more about the proper course of
    action. He then went off to Mentone to bid god-speed to the girl he really loved, a woman
    writer who was living with one of his editors so long as her lungs would let her (they
    lasted till 1922). Alas for gods whose wings are clipped by love and their feet hobbled by
    habit. We were to meet Sullivan at Marseilles, sailing for Palermo with or without him as
    his editor might permit. The few days of absence had wrecked</p>
    <p>{869}</p>
    <p>him mentally and morally. We had no sooner sat down to lunch than he burst into a
    torrent of maniacal ejaculations.</p>
    <p>All this was spouted by a whale answering to the name of &quot;I want Sylvia
    back&quot;. When his breath failed, and he fell back panting like a mad dog, I remarked
    between mouthfuls, &quot;Righto!&quot; I'll have to get the cabin changed and take a few
    of Sylvia's things out of my trunk. I think there's nothing else, provided, of course,
    Sylvia wishes it.&quot; The poor man was flabbergasted and Sylvia flew into a royal rage.
    My contempt for him was one thing; my indifference to her quite another. But neither ran
    any danger of pride. They were reduced to shamefaced stammering. My cheerful calm daunted
    them. Sullivan, selfish and stupid, actually proposed to hurry back that night to Paris,
    though Sylvia was obviously fagged out with the journey of the day before, to say nothing
    of her having set her heart on spending a few days enjoying the beauties of the Riviera
    --- it was her first escape from England.</p>
    <p>On that point only did I try to influence Sullivan. He saw that I was right and
    grudgingly agreed to give the poor child a few days' enjoyment. With this exception I
    concentrated my whole energy on impressing Sullivan with the supreme importance to science
    of <em>The Book of the Law</em>. I further offered to prove the efficacy of its formulae
    by developing him within three months into a first-rate man.</p>
    <p>I repeated my invariable epitome, &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot;
    &quot;You, being a man, are therefore a star. The soul of a star is what we call genius.
    You are a genius. This fact is obscured either by moral complexes which enmesh it, or lack
    of adequate machinery to express it in terms of action.&quot; To this universal theorem
    must be added a rider suited to any case under consideration.</p>
    <p>To Sullivan I explained, &quot;You already possess a perfected machinery. Your
    knowledge is enormously above the average. You reason clearly and correctly. You have a
    fair command of English. You lack only the link between soul and sense. You admit yourself
    second-rate and refuse to believe in the possibility of becoming first-rate, despite my
    theoretical demonstration and the testimony of my previous successes. That despair is,
    itself, one complex which inhibits your genius. Today you have shown me another. A mere
    animal appetite sharpened by a few days of starvation can wreck your intellect, sweep
    every decent instinct overboard and make you treat your word of honour as idle.&quot;</p>
    <p>He had then just enough sense to understand me; but the foul fiend tore him the more
    terribly at the least effort of his sanity and decency to asset itself.</p>
    <p>I saw them off by the train, very heavy at heart. I was sorry for Sylvia buried alive
    in a south coast village without a soul to speak to and no resource in herself but her
    music. Yet after all she did not much matter. She</p>
    <p>{870}</p>
    <p>was one of millions in a similar plight. Also even if saved, the profit was mostly
    personal. The case of her husband was altogether more serious. His abject surrender to the
    brute was a defeat involving a whole world in the disaster. I could have made him the
    evangelist of Thelema; with his abilities he might have been more important in history
    than St. Paul. But he could never do any great work as long as he was liable to be
    obsessed by the body, any more than a motorist could break the record from Land's End to
    John o'Groats if he shied and ran off the road every time his eye was caught by a tree.</p>
    <p>I found the abbey in admirable order. We had a new member, a boy named Godwin<strong>1</strong>,
    whom I had known in America. When he first wrote me, he was in Annapolis, an attendant in
    the naval hospital. The boy had amazing ability, backed by exceptional energy and other
    moral qualities such as the Great Work, or indeed any work worth the name, requires. Out
    of his scanty savings he had bought a set of <em>The
    Equinox</em></a> for a hundred dollars and several other expensive items. He grudged his
    time as little as his cash. He learnt by heart an astounding number of our sacred books,
    and when later on I asked him to compile a dictionary of Sanskrit roots for my use on a
    certain research, he went at it with a will and made good. As against all this, he was
    surly, mulish and bitterly rebellious. He raved against the injustice of being punished
    for breaking the regulations of the navy. I vainly showed him that when he signed on as he
    did of his own free will, he pledged himself to conform with the regulations and that in
    breaking them he blasphemed himself.</p>
    <p>Reckless in his ardour for knowledge, he injected himself with forty grains of cocaine.
    He had never tried it before. All he knew was that half a grain had been known to cause
    death. The record of his experiment makes interesting reading. He began by trying to set a
    piece of glass on fire by the force of his will.</p>
    <p>The next act was plagiarized from Samson. He hung on to a pillar while the Philistines,
    some half a dozen husky sailor boys, tried to pull him off. They finally managed to sit on
    his head and control his frantic punches and kicks. They then got surgeons on the job who
    pulled him through. In a couple of days he was all right again. His experiment, if
    intended to escape notice, failed. They hauled him before the Lord High-Muck-Amuck, who
    told him, with the best respects and wishes of Uncle Sam for a prosperous passage to
    perdition, that after a careful consideration the Navy Department had unanimously decided
    that they could sweep the seas clear of the White Ensign without troubling themselves to
    put him to the inconvenience of co-operating. Shaking the pipe-clay of Annapolis from his
    person, he favoured New York with a flying visit, dropped in on me, and --- please could I
    find him a job? I did what I could, but before I found him work, he had got the Lafayette
    to</p>
    <p>{871}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH note: This is C. F. Russel</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>try him as a waiter. I thought he might be of use to my &quot;son&quot; in Detroit and
    wrote asking him to find an opening. He did so and Godwin went off.</p>
    <p>In all he said and did, one peculiarity obtruded itself --- this violent reaction
    against any act of authority as such, however reasonable, however much to his own
    advantage. When he noticed the suggestion of discipline, he became blind with rage. His
    mental faculties were simply snowed under. Having habitually yielded to this impulse, it
    became a fixed form of his mind, so that even between spasms he would brood incessantly
    over his wrongs. I hoped the abbey would break up this complex. For a time he improved
    greatly, but in my absence the Ape, in whose hands I had left the sole authority, had very
    ably established a routine, adherence to which minimized the time necessary to the
    prosperity of the household, and thus allowed each mentor the theoretical maximum of
    leisure for his own chosen work. Godwin rebelled. On two occasions he became, if not
    literally insane, at least so lost to self-control as to assault her murderously. In both
    cases, she cowed him by sheer moral superiority as wild beasts are supposed to shrink from
    the eye which is fixed fearlessly upon their fury. After my return he improved. I recall
    only one outbreak. My experience was the same as the Ape's. I stood up to him and made him
    obey, and he obeyed.</p>
    <p>The occasion is not without interest. Frater Progradior, 1° = 10ø A.'. A.'., and IX°
    O.T.O., was expected to arrive from New South Wales to spend some four months seeking
    initiation under my personal guidance. His age was fifty-three and his rank in both Orders
    such as to command the utmost respect from junior members. Apart from this, his age and
    the fact of his having come so far should have made Godwin eager to show him all possible
    consideration. The question arose where he should sleep. The answer was self-evident. The
    only possible arrangement for many reasons was for Godwin to give up his room temporarily.
    We gave Godwin several opportunities of making the suggestion spontaneously. The propriety
    was as obvious to him as to anyone else. He sulked in silence. I was sorry to have to
    issue an order, a thing I had not done for many months, but I had to do so. Godwin refused
    point-blank. I pointed out quite kindly the various considerations which applied. I might
    as well have talked to a turnip, better in fact, for a turnip's eye would not have got
    bloodshot, nor the eyes swollen with blood almost to bursting. He again refused violently.
    It was absurd, he being our guest with no claim whatever upon us. I had to say, &quot;Out
    of your room by six o'clock, or out of the abbey and you don't come back!&quot; By six
    o'clock he was in his new quarters.</p>
    <p>Alas for these men who cannot be taught the elements of common sense by any means
    soever. Not long afterwards some trivial incident touched the same spot. I thought he
    would be the better for a holiday from the abbey. He was working so hard that his health
    began to make me anxious. He interpreted</p>
    <p>{872}</p>
    <p>my suggestion as a banishment and instead of going, as I proposed, to Palermo, and
    putting in a month working up the interest of the people there about us, he went off to
    the top of the Rock without any provisions of any kind. He had taken an oath not to come
    down before eight days. In subsequent clauses appeared such austerities as this; not to
    allow water to touch his face! It was a rotten thing to do. Cypris was very fond of him
    and she went through agonies watching him pace to and fro on the parched sun-blistering
    crags like the possessed of Godara among the tombs. I refused to interfere. He was up
    there by no will of mine. Whenever he chose he could come down and eat and drink, sitting
    and clothed and in his right mind. So Cypris filled a rucksack with food and drink and
    dragged herself up those sweltering slopes to the ruined stone hut, where the crazed
    creature had made his headquarters. He refused to speak to her, but I think she got him to
    drink some water. He must indeed have perished for thirst otherwise.</p>
    <p>I wish I had a copy of his Magical Record of this Retirement. It was an incoherent
    scrawl of furious ravings mostly aimed against the innocent Jones (Jesus Stansfield Christ
    was his favourite brickbat) in Chicago. I have no idea what excited such animosity. His
    magical work was chiefly to count the loose stones of the floor of his hut, and divine
    from their number the most erratic nonsense which seemed to him the sublime arcana of
    Grades so exalted that a mere Magus was in comparison one poor pip of a China orange to
    all Lombard Street and the City of London to boot. For a magical wand, he had picked up a
    piece of dry stick which he chewed incessantly under the impression that by so doing he
    was putting the affairs of the planet in shape during such moments as he could spare from
    adjusting the solar system and showing the gods how to run the universe, any recalcitrant
    deity being ruthlessly smacked into repentance.</p>
    <p>Cypris begged me to intervene, urging that he was irresponsible. She said she felt sure
    that he would come down if I wrote to him to do so. I consented. That day after lunch, as
    I lay half asleep on a couch by the main door, Godwin rushed in. His appearance really
    alarmed me; unshaven, unwashed, his movements violent and jerky and his eyes rolling
    wildly, I should not have mistaken him for the Prince of Wales. He flung a rucksack on the
    floor at my feet and roared out &quot;Aleister Crowley&quot; in a harsh, angry, uneven
    growl. He then went off as suddenly and strangely as he had come. When I saw him next he
    was himself again, merely showing signs of exhaustion. He was tired and penitent like a
    naughty child who has found forgiveness. His final fireworks had been dramatically
    admirable. He had gone to the barber's to be shaved. But no sooner was he thoroughly
    lathered than he remembered his oath not to let water touch his face. He bolted out of the
    shop and stamped up the street, the foam from his face flying in all directions. He put
    his head down and charged through somebody's private estate, vaulted the</p>
    <p>{873)</p>
    <p>wall at the back and spurted up the slope as if the devil were at his heels instead of
    merely in his heart.</p>
    <p>This was the beginning of the end. Even after he had regained sanity in most matters,
    he clung to the conviction that his adventure on the Rock had initiated him to a Grade far
    superior to mine. I should, of course, have been only too glad if this had happened. The
    decaying debris of my Oedipus complex still stinks, which stink being interpreted may be
    rendered in English, &quot;How I wish I had someone to go to, a man like myself, not an
    angel, whose humanity would understand and sympathize with my weakness and weariness, and
    on whose shoulders I might shift at least a little of the responsibility which is breaking
    my back!&quot;</p>
    <p>Poor Godwin tried to smother his shame by piling pride upon it. His megalomania grew on
    him at a frightful pace. His conscience was crushed into a pulp and his common sense
    scattered to the winds. He suddenly developed an entirely new defect. I had always found
    him truthful. He now adopted a policy of deliberate deceitfulness with the greatest
    subtlety. It was perfectly imbecile. He had only to say what he wanted and I should have
    done whatever I could to help him, whatever it was. He, however, persuaded himself that he
    must keep his plans dark and the final absurdity of the whole thing was that I was aware
    from the beginning exactly what he intended to do. Our relations ended, bar occasional
    correspondence, towards the end of the year, when he left us to go to Australia avowedly
    to help Frater Progradior in establishing the Law. However, he only stayed a short time in
    Sydney and went on to San Francisco, where, free from all guidance or control, he broke
    out into a series of spasms of which I do not know the details, and which are of little
    interest as being merely casual symptoms of a state of mind which I had already studied
    sufficiently. I asked myself, &quot;How now?&quot; Has Thelema failed in this case? I have
    thought this over ruthlessly, but my final judgment is that the Law is not touched by
    these events. It seems to me beyond dispute that any conceivable code of conduct presumes
    implicitly that men always act on certain fundamental principles which they carry out,
    well or ill, within wide limits; those limits being exceeded, the man is not a man
    &quot;within the meaning of the act&quot; and the Law cease to apply to him. For instance,
    we feel safe in acting on the assumption that a man will not walk into a blazing house,
    and we make no law to punish any such action. We assume that a man always acts in what he
    believes to be his own best interest. The conduct of Godwin was irrational, his motive had
    no logical link with his actions. It is therefore impossible to imagine any formula by
    which to judge him.</p>
    <p>So far, so good, but at least I failed to break up the complex which obsessed him. That
    is true, but I blame my inexperience and nowise the principles on which I proceed. I am
    not without excuse. Let me give one</p>
    <p>{874}</p>
    <p>example to illustrate the impossibility of guiding him or even enlightening his mind.
    He was anxious to do certain magical work, which forms part of the task of a Grade which
    he had not attained. In order to devote himself to this, he proposed to neglect the work
    prescribed for the Grade which he actually possessed. I pointed this out, and after some
    show of sulks, he agreed. A day or so later, in discussing some point of magical theory, I
    happened to say, &quot;I want you to understand very thoroughly what this implies.&quot;
    He retorted violently, &quot;I'm not an 8° = 3ø! To understand is not a part of the work
    of my Grade!&quot; To that he stuck. It was useless to argue that the understanding of an
    8° = 3ø has a technical definition, and that a child of two years old must understand
    the alphabet, if it is to be any use to it. Stupidities of this type were constantly
    coming up.</p>
    <p>In matters like chess, he was just as bad as he was about Magick. He begged me to teach
    him the game. I prescribed a system of study to be vitalized by daily practice with me
    over the board. For some reason which I never succeeded in grasping, he refused
    obstinately to follow my advice in any single point. When we played he grew steadily worse
    and when asked to account for this, he took up the position that nothing was to be gained
    by winning. He was even ass enough to quote <em>The Book of the Law</em> about lust of
    result. He could hardly help seeing that unless one played to win, there was no point in
    playing at all. Nothing moved him. He simply gave up playing. The stupidity was really
    disheartening. He had a fine natural ability to judge position and invent combinations. A
    little technical knowledge of the openings, and a systematic study of the end game which
    he might have acquired in a year, should have made him a first-class amateur. My worst
    weakness is this: I hate to see good material wasted.</p>
    <p>So much for Godwin. In brilliant contrast stands the figure of Frater Progradior.</p>
    <p>My success with him is enough to wipe out a dozen failures and more. He was a
    Lancashire man of good family which had fallen into undeserved distress. As a result he
    had had to work with his hands from the age of nine. He had always been eager and earnest
    about spiritual affairs. He had begun by joining the Theosophical Society, but after
    seventeen years found himself unlightened in the slightest. He had then put in eleven
    years with the A.'. A.'., but in the absence of personal guidance his progress had been
    slow. He arrived weary of life, despairing of truth.</p>
    <p>I begin my training as a general rule by prescribing a few preliminary practices such
    as are universally beneficial. In the meantime I watch quietly for symptoms by which to
    determine the diagnosis. He was rather a hard case. I was puzzled. There was clearly
    something very wrong indeed, but I could not imagine what. Of course in my conscious self
    I am always stupid, but the Magus who uses me knows his job.</p>
    <p>{875}</p>
    <p>One afternoon we went off bathing with the Ape. I prattled as we walked quite
    pointlessly and just as we reached the edge of the cliff above the bay I made some casual
    remark which proved a winning shot. He stopped short and gasped; his eyes starting from
    his head. I am so stupid, let me report, that I failed to notice anything special. I was
    mildly surprised to see him dash down the path like a young goat, tear off his clothes,
    and sprint into the sea like an alarmed seal. He never spoke a word till after the swim
    and the return to the road. He then said with a pale face and in awed accents,
    &quot;Please tell me again what you said just now?&quot; &quot;How the devil should I
    remember?&quot; I returned courteously. He stammeringly reminded me of the subject, and of
    course I was able to repeat my remarks, which were nothing specially striking. He asked me
    to discuss the subject more fully, which I did, after which he relapsed into silence.
    Directly he reached the abbey, he passed into a state of trance which lasted three whole
    days without a break. He then came to me looking like an incarnation of pure joy and told
    me what had happened. Without knowledge of his need I had unwittingly given him the key to
    the inmost treasury of his soul. One minute facet of truth unveiled from the matrix by the
    wheel of my word had let in the light. In three days he had achieved the critical
    initiation which had baffled him for nearly thirty years. I prescribed a Magical
    Retirement so that he might fix in his consciousness that lightning flash as a permanent
    arc-lamp. This proved a success.</p>
    <p>My own joy was boundless. I was inspired to prepare a perfected ritual for the
    attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and presented him
    with a copy of the manuscript for use in his operation. I entitled it <em>Liber Samekh</em></a>. It is the most powerful and
    exalted of all my magical instructions. I think he was helped not a little, not only by
    the ritual itself, but by the feeling that I had sufficient care for him --- he suffered
    from humility --- to devote myself so passionately to making his path plain.</p>
    <p>One result of this Retirement is astounding from the point of view of the profane. The
    Spirit of the Lord descended upon him and opened his eyes to a a series of visions of a
    class far more exalted and intense and intimate than anything he had hitherto experienced.
    He was inspired to write these down during their actual occurrence, and here is the
    marvel. His education had been quite elementary. He could neither spell nor construct his
    sentences correctly, nor had he command of any extended vocabulary. What, then, was my
    amazement to perceive in his style an originality and power of the first order. It, not
    less than his subject, was quite dissimilar from that of John Bunyan, and yet the
    suggestion of identity was undeniable. It was a kinship of soul.</p>
    <p>Parallel with this spiritual attainment, his mental and physical powers were renewed as
    the eagle's. His depression vanished and was replaced by calm,</p>
    <p>{876}</p>
    <p>deep joy, overflowing and manifest to all of us. He began to take long solitary walks
    across the hills and did his twenty miles a day as he had not done for a quarter of a
    century. We felt it as an actual bereavement when the time came for him to go back to
    Sydney.</p>
