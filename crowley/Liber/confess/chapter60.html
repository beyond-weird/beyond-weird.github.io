    <p>The years 1907 and 1908 may be described as years of fulfilment. No new current came to
    stir my life; but the seeds which had been sown in the past came many of them to harvest.
    I had come to my full stature as a poet. My technique was perfect; it had shaken off from
    its sandals the last dust which they had acquired by walking in the ways of earlier
    masters. I produced lyric and dramatic poetry which shows an astounding mastery of rhythm
    and rime, a varied power of expression which has no equal in the history of the language,
    and an intensity of idea which eats into the soul of the reader like vitriol.</p>
    <p>I should have been assigned publicly my proper place among my peers of the past without
    difficulty had it not been of one fatal fact. My point of view is so original, my thoughts
    so profound, and my allusions so recondite, that superficial readers, carried away by the
    sheer music of the words, found themselves, so to speak, intoxicated and unable to
    penetrate to the pith. People did not realize that my sonorous similes possessed a subtle
    sense intelligible only to those whose minds were familiar with the subject. It is, in
    fact, necessary to study almost any poem of mine like a palimpsest. The slightest phrase
    is essential; each one must be interpreted individually, and the poem read again until its
    personality presents itself. People who like my poetry, bar those who are simply tickled
    by the sound or what they imagine to be the sense, agree that it spoils them for any other
    poetry.</p>
    <p>For instance, if I mention a beetle I expect the reader to understand an allusion to
    the sun at midnight in its moral sense of Light-in-Darkness; if a pelican, to the legend
    that she pierces her own breast to feed her young on her heart's bleed; if a goat, to the
    entire symbolism of Capricornus, the god Pan, Satan or Jesus (Jesus being born at the
    winter solstice, when the sun enters Capricorn); if a pearl, to the correspondences of
    that stone as a precious and glittering secretion of the oyster, by which I mean that
    invertebrate animal life of man, the Nephesch.</p>
    <p>It must not be supposed that I am obscure on purpose. I have thought in the language of
    correspondences continuously, and it never occurs to me that other people have not at
    their fingers' ends the whole rosary of symbols.</p>
    <p>During these two years my domestic tragedy was becoming constantly more acute. Rose
    told me that she was keeping her word, but it had become impossible to do any work where
    she was. She was in a state of continual irritation. I was obliged to take rooms in Jermyn
    Street in order to have a moment to myself. In the autumn of 1907 on returning from
    Tangiers, I</p>
    <p>{534}</p>
    <p>found that she had obtained one hundred and fifty bottles of whisky from one grocer
    alone in five months. Confronted with the fact, she broke down and agreed to take a cure
    for two months, in an establishment at Leicester. At the end of that time I took her
    climbing for a fortnight and she came back to London in excellent health; but ten days
    later the disease broke out with redoubled violence. I did everything that was humanly
    possible; but it was fighting a losing game.</p>
    <p>Finally, early in 1909, the doctor threw up the sponge. He told her that she must agree
    to be sequestrated for two years. She refused: I insisted upon a divorce. I loved her as
    passionately as ever --- more so than ever, perhaps, since it was the passion of uttermost
    despair. I insisted on a divorce. I would not be responsible for her. I would not stand by
    and see her commit suicide. It was agreed that I should be defendant as a matter of
    chivalry, and the necessary evidence was manufactured. I continued, however, to look after
    her as before; we even stayed together as much as we dared, and I saw her almost every
    day, either in our house or at my rooms. Directly the divorce was pronounced I returned
    from Algeria, whither I had gone to be out of the way during the trial, and we were
    photographed together, with the baby, at the Dover Street studios.</p>
    <p>I had written the agony of my soul in <em>Rosa Decidua</em>, which I dedicated to Lord
    Salvesen (not Salvarsan), the judge who presided at the trial. This poem was printed
    privately and a copy with the best of the photographs was sent to the judge, with a polite
    letter of thanks. (It is reprinted in <em>The Winged Beetle</em>, pp. 130-149.) This poem
    is, perhaps, my high-water mark in realism. It reveals my human self as I had never even
    attempted to do. I trace my agony through every writhe. I feel compelled to quote a few
    lines:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This is no tragedy of little tears.<br>
        My brain is hard and cold; there is no beat<br>
        Of its blood; there is no heat<br>
        Of sacred fire upon my lips to sing.<br>
        My heart is dead; I say that name thrice over;<br>
        Rose! --- Rose! --- Rose! ---<br>
        Even as lover should call to lover;<br>
        There is no quickening,<br>
        No flood, no fount that flows;<br>
        No water wells from the dead spring.<br>
        My thoughts come singly, dry, contemptuous,<br>
        Too cold for hate; all I can say is that they come<br>
        From some dead sphere without me;<br>
        Singly they come, beats of a senseless drum<br>
        Jarred by a fool, harsh, unharmonious.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{535}</p>
    <p>But even my utmost realism dared not face the supreme horror. Allan Bennett</a> had written to me to beg me to
    break off sexual relations with Rose. He knew as I did not, that any child of hers must be
    under the curse; for, while the baby lay dying in the hospital, its mother was trying to
    drown her anguish in drink, and it was slowly borne in upon me that the fever was due to
    the fact that the moment my back was turned Rose had broken out, had neglected to cleanse
    the nipple of the feeding bottle, and thereby exposed the child to the germs of typhoid.
    The catastrophe which had stricken the father to the heart was the sister of that which
    was to perform the same office to the husband.</p>
    <p>This poem has everywhere been recognized as overwhelming. E. S. P. Haynes told me that
    it was the most powerful that he had ever read, and Frank Harris wrote from what he
    thought was his death bed, &quot;In <em>Rosa Decidua</em> there is more&quot;
    (&quot;scil&quot;. than in some other poem of which he has been writing) &quot;a
    despairing view of life --- 'beats of a senseless drum --- all's filth'. To 'My tongue is
    palsied ... exquisite agony.' Astounding realism raised to art by perfect artistry.&quot;</p>
    <p>We went on living together, more or less; but her condition became rapidly worse and in
    the autumn of 1911 she had to be put in an asylum, suffering from alcoholic dementia.</p>
    <p>Another seed of the past began to bear fruit at this time. I had never attempted to
    transmit my occult knowledge as such. I had never attempted to write prose, as such, apart
    from short accounts of my climbs, with the exception of the preface to <em>White Stains</em>
    (<em>Collected Works</em>, vol. II, pp. 195-8). <em>Berashith</em></a>
    was my first serious attempt at an essay. That and &quot;Science and Buddhism&quot; were
    followed by a <em>jeu d'esprit</em> on Shakespeare (<em>Collected Works</em>, vol. II, pp.
    185-90); &quot;Pansil&quot; (vol. II, pp. 192-4); &quot;After Agnosticism&quot; (vol. II,
    pp. 206-8); &quot;Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum&quot; (vol II, pp. 212-24); &quot;The Three
    Characteristics&quot; (vol. II, pp. 225-32; &quot;The Excluded Middle&quot; (vol. II, pp.
    262-6); &quot;Time&quot; (vol. II, pp. 267-82); &quot;The Initiated Interpretation of
    Ceremonial Magic&quot; (vol. II, pp. 203-4); &quot;Qabalistic Dogma&quot; (vol. I, pp.
    265-6); the introduction to <em>Alice, An Adultery</em> (vol. II, pp. 58-61). Some of the
    ghazals of the <em>Bagh-i-Muattar</em> are in prose, as well as the preliminary matter;
    and there is <em>Eleusis</em> (vol. III, pp. 219-30).</p>
    <p>Most of these were written from a very curious point of view. It was not exactly that I
    had my tongue in my cheek, but I took a curious pleasure in expressing serious opinions in
    a fantastic form. I had an instinctive feeling against prose; I had not appreciated its
    possibilities. Its apparent lack of form seemed to me to stamp it as an essentially
    inferior means of expression. I wrote it, therefore, in a rather shamefaced spirit. I
    deliberately introduced bad jokes to show that I did not take myself seriously; whereas
    the truth was I was simply nervous about my achievement, just as a man afraid to disgrace</p>
    <p>{536}</p>
    <p>himself as a boxer might pretend that the bout was not in earnest. My prose is
    consequently marred by absolutely stupid blasphemies against itself.</p>
    <p>I now began to see that this was schoolboyish bashfulness, and to feel my
    responsibility as an exponent of the hidden knowledge, to treat my prose as reverently as
    my verse, and (consequently) to produce masterpieces of learning and wit. The
    &quot;Dedication and Counter-Dedication&quot; of <em>Knox Om Pax</em> is wholly admirable
    and it rises to a delightful satirical climax of four stanzas on the &quot;empty-headed
    Athenians&quot;. &quot;The Wake World&quot; is a sublime description of the Path of the
    Wise, rendered picturesque by the use of the symbols of the Taro, and charming by its
    personification of the soul as a maiden. &quot;My name is Lola, because I am the Key of
    Delights, and the other children in my dream call me Lola Daydream.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Ali Sloper; or the Forty Liars&quot; shows traces of my old vulgarity. The <em>dramatis
    personae</em> contain a lot of bad puns and personal gibes, but the dialogue shows decided
    improvement; and the &quot;Essay on Truth&quot; is both acute and witty, with few
    blemishes. &quot;Thien Tao&quot; gives my solution of the main ethical and philosophical
    problems of humanity with a description of the general method of emancipating oneself from
    the obsession of one's own ideas, while there are passages of remarkable eloquence.</p>
    <p>The last essay in <em>Knonx Om Pax</em>, &quot;The Stone of the Philosophers which is
    hidden in Abiegnus, the Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation&quot;, is really beyond praise.
    Its genesis is interesting. I had written at odd times, but mostly during my travels with
    the Earl of Tankerville, a number of odd lyrics. The idea came to me that I might enhance
    their value by setting them in prose. I therefore wrote a symposium of a poet, a
    traveller, a philosophical globetrotter, an adept, a classical scholar and a doctor. They
    are made to converse about the chronic calamity of society, and the poems (ostensibly
    written by one or other of the men) carry on the thought. The result is, in reality, a new
    form of art; and I certainly assisted the lyrics by giving them appropriate springboards.</p>
    <p>In 1903, too, I wrote The Soldier and the Hunchback, !
    and ?</a> and <em>The Psychology of Hashish</em></a>.
    The one goes to the roots of scepticism and mysticism, and represents them as alternative
    moods, neither valued in itself yet each a complete answer to its predecessor. I show that
    by perseverance in transcending each in turn, the original crude distinction between
    affirmation and negation tends to disappear; the supreme doubt is more positive than the
    more limited assertion.</p>
    <p>&quot;The Psychology of Hashish&quot; pleases me more every time I read it. It contains
    such a wealth of knowledge, it shows such profundity of thought, that I find myself today
    still wondering how I ever wrote it. I find in it ideas which I am hardly aware that I
    possess today; how I could have thought</p>
    <p>{537}</p>
    <p>thus at this elementary stage of my career, and written it all down in a single day, is
    bewildering. It is completely free from any blemishes of the old type. The sublimity of my
    subject possessed me.</p>
    <p>One other seed had fallen upon fertile ground. &quot;The chance of the geologic
    period&quot; had been seized by Captain John Charles Frederick Fuller, of the First
    Oxfordshire Light Infantry. It had come his way through the Rationalist Press Association,
    to whose publications he subscribed. He had not done any serious writing before; his
    utmost had been a few insignificant articles and poems, which he contributed to the <em>Agnostic
    Journal</em>. He was fighting valiantly against Christianity by the side of
    &quot;Saladin&quot;, William Ross Stewart, who was the leader of one of the main branches
    of militant agnosticism. The army of Satan had, unfortunately, failed to keep discipline
    in the face of the enemy. The anti-Christins were in fact as prone to split up into sects
    as the non-conformists themselves. Bradlaugh's personality was big enough to enable him to
    keep any differences that he may have had with Huxley in the background, but the
    successors of these paladins were degenerate. Mrs. Besant had broken away from atheism
    altogether; her hysteria handed her over from one strong influence to another as it
    appealed to her imagination. G. W. Foote, with the medal of his martyrdom glittering on
    his manly breast, marched monotonously against the mob of Christianity. He had suffered
    for the cause and was consumed by personal pride on that account. Ross Stewart had more
    literary leanings and was accordingly exclusive. Bernard Shaw was engaged in public
    exhibitions of rapier play; his subtlety made his colleagues doubt his sincerity; and
    without question his attacks on Christianity had lost their sting by reason of the very
    bitterness of his contempt for convention.</p>
    <p>The Rationalist Press Association, with Grant Allen, Charles Watts, Edward Clodd,
    Joseph McCabe, Bertrand Russell, E. S. P. Haynes (the lawyer, by the way, who had so
    elegantly and adroitly arranged the details of my divorce) and numerous other prominent
    people, was, above all, anxious to be respectable. It felt it to be the most important
    point of policy not to give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme. Shelley's domestic
    diversions shocked them; they wanted to prove that conventional morality would not suffer
    by the abolition of Christianity. One of the Association's own lecturers, Harry Boulter,
    was prosecuted fro the blasphemy of saying in Hyde Park what a thousand others, from
    Voltaire to Tyndall, had said for centuries, and it refused to defend him because his
    remarks had shocked policemen. The attitude seemed to me utterly ignoble. I have no
    particular sympathy with Boulter, but I recognized that in destroying the delusions of the
    vulgar one must use the kind of dynamite which they understand.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I think the Rationalist Press Association ought to have accepted
    battle and fought the blasphemy laws to a finish. It lost prestige by</p>
    <p>{538}</p>
    <p>deserting a comrade. People said, as they said of Shaw, that it was &quot;too proud to
    fight&quot;. There were still other sects of satanists, down to the Reverend Guy A.
    Alfred, who mixed up religious and political revolt like the Bolsheviks. In one sense the
    attitude is logical and it is certainly courageous.</p>
    <p>Fuller knew the animal and arranged with him to issue a cheap edition of <em>The Star
    in the West</em> with a preface of his &quot;Alfred's&quot; own, through the Bakunin
    Press. He thought we should begin reconstruction of civilization at the very bottom.
    Alfred was certainly our man! When I read Conrad's <em>The Secret Agent</em> I instantly
    recognized him in Comrade Ossipon. I had never met so repulsive a type. Yet the creature
    had scholarship of a sort, keen courage and intellectual integrity. I say
    &quot;intellectual integrity&quot; because I would not have trusted him with a threepenny
    bit. He did, in fact, cheat us out of a considerable amount, though we went into the
    business with our eyes open. With regard to the logic of his view, that Christianity and
    the social system stood or fell together, I object. That is emphatically the Christian
    view. The elder Cato was not an anarchist, nor Julius Caesar a disciple of Karl Marx. I
    entirely agree with Nietzsche that Christianity is the formula of the servile state; true
    aristocracy and true democracy are equally its enemies. In my ideal state everyone is
    respected for what he is. There will always be slaves, and the slave is to be defined as
    he who acquiesces in being a slave.</p>
    <p>Such was the situation when Fuller, home on leave from India, came to see me and told
    me that he was competing for the prize essay on my work. He was entirely at one with me on
    the point of my attitude to Christianity. We regard it as historically false, morally
    infamous, politically contemptible and socially pestilential. We agree with Shelley,
    Keats, Byron, Swinburne and James Thomson as far as they went. We agree with Voltaire,
    Gibbon, Strauss, Huxley, Herbert Spencer, Tyndall, J. G. Frazer, Ibsen and Nietzsche as
    far as <em>they</em> went. But we were absolutely opposed to any ideas of social
    revolution. We deplored the fact that our militant atheists were not aristocrats like
    Bolingbroke. We had no use for the sordid slum writers and Hyde Park ranters who had
    replace the aristocratic infidel of the past. We felt ourselves to be leaders; but the
    only troops at our disposal were either mercenaries or mobs. Like the prince of the
    Fronde, we found ourselves fighting by the side of a venal and ignorant parliament,
    disorderly banditti, a mob of bourgeois and a horde of beggars.</p>
    <p>The position was all the more annoying because we knew perfectly well that the vast
    majority of the aristocracy, both of blood and of brains, were heartily on our side or
    profoundly indifferent and aloof. But they were all afraid to come out into the open and
    sweep religion away; or else felt themselves personally secure from any annoyance and
    therefore inclined to let sleeping dogs lie. For example, it was known that two thirds of
    the dons of Trinity College, Cambridge, were openly atheistic, and, according to all</p>
    <p>{539}</p>
    <p>the principle of the university, should have been <em>ipso facto</em> deprived of their
    fellowships, yet they were perfectly safe in the saddle so long as they abstained from any
    overt act which the authorities could not overlook. We thought that this hypocrisy was not
    the harmless practical joke which it seems to be at first sight. We could not ourselves
    have acquiesced consciously in any such evasion, and we did not understand how people of
    such intellectual superiority could agree to hold their positions on such humiliating
    terms.</p>
    <p>It is (incidentally) hardly less humiliating for Christianity itself that it that it
    should be so powerless, despite its ostensible impregnability. It could not furnish the
    necessary complement of men of intellect from its own ranks, and the college was compelled
    to endure the contempt of its own fellows. It could not do without them; it dared not
    prescribe them; it dared not prescribe them; it had to be careful to avoid so much as
    questioning them on the essential points on which their tenure of office was supposed to
    depend. It dared not even make any overt endeavour to alter the situation. It dared not
    even lament the evil days on which it had fallen. It had to pretend that all was well: to
    deny boisterously a fact which was notorious.</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, Christianity is everywhere in more or less the same position,
    thought the most liberal estimate of the proportion of population that attends any place
    of worship scarcely reaches one and a half per cent. The Church claims --- when not
    wailing to the opposite effect --- that the entire population is actively Christian. The
    press cannot believe its ears when it transpires that some professor of geology does not
    believe in Genesis. There is indeed something pitifully heroic about the enormity of the
    belief. It it were not that this infinitesimal minority is able to exercise such an
    asphyxiating effect on popular thought, and such a murderous grip upon popular morals, to
    torture and deform the minds of children, to make hypocrisy the price of happiness, one
    might even sympathize with this frog in its attempts to persuade itself and its
    neightbours that it is an ox. On one point only were Fuller and I at odds. His hatred for
    Christianity extended to the idea of religion in general. He had, of course, a sympathy in
    his heart for Islam; the manliness of the Mohammedan makes it impossible to despise his
    belief in Allah. Islam is free from the degrading doctrine of atonement and the
    glorification of the slave virtues. The Moslem's attitude to Allah only errs in so far as
    it involves the childish idea of personifying the powers of the universe. It is right that
    we should reverence the majesty of nature and obey her laws; but he fought with me, hand
    to hand, week after week, about the question of Magick. He had originally intended his
    essay to conclude with the sixth chapter, and he had scrupulously avoided any reference to
    the magical and mystical side of my work; nay, even to the philosophical side so far as
    that was concerned with transcendentalism. But I showed him that the</p>
    <p>{540}</p>
    <p>study must be incomplete unless he added a chapter expounding my views on these
    subjects. Thus chapter seven came to be written.</p>
    <p>It is a very complete and just exposition of my views, and it is especially to be
    noticed that within the one hundred and thirty-three pages there is no reference to <em>The
    Book of the Law</em>. (At the time of publication, therefore, I was still keeping the hem
    of my garment scrupulously away from the Cairo working.) By the time he had written this
    chapter, I had brought him to see that materialism, in any ordinary sense of the word, was
    thoroughly unsatisfactory as an explanation of the universe; but he was not in the least
    inclined to accept any theories which might involve belief of any kind in a spiritual
    hierarchy. In the course of our argument I had myself been made uneasy by a subconscious
    feeling that, watertight as my system was in itself, certain legitimate inferences might
    be drawn from it which I was not drawing.</p>
    <p><em>The Book of the Law</em> annoyed me; I was still obsessed by the idea that secrecy
    was necessary to a magical document, that publication would destroy its importance. I
    determined, in a mood which I can only describe as a fit of ill temper, to publish <em>The
    Book of the Law</em>, and then get rid of it for ever.</p>
    <p>I was also annoyed by the way in which Fuller stuck to his guns about the magical
    hierarchy in general. In a spirit of mischief I sent him a typescript of <em>The Book of
    the Law</em> and asked him to tell me what he thought of it. I wanted to disgust him with
    myself; I wanted him to class me finally as a hopeless crank. His answer came in the
    course of two or three days: I could not believe my eyes. This, he wrote, is the utterance
    of a Master. What did he know about Masters, confound him! It was as if I had sent a copy
    of <em>Tit-Bits</em> to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and he had reverently pronounced it
    to be the authentic Logia of &quot;our Lord&quot;.</p>
    <p>But there was no getting over the fact. Here was the Book which I hated and feared, the
    Book from which I was desperately trying to escape, and here was a man who hated anything
    of the sort without fearing it in the least, a man who had nothing to escape from; and it
    was instantly accepted by him at its face value. It's no good arguing whether a thing is a
    hammer or not, when all you know about it is that it has a habit of knocking you down.</p>
    <p>It was useless to struggle further. So late as October 1908, I was carrying out a
    Retirement (see &quot;John St. John&quot;), and invoking my Holy Guardian Angel, without
    any reference to <em>The Book of the Law</em>. Fuller and I had gone to work to edit my
    magical diaries and present to the world the story of my magical career in &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King</a>&quot;, as if the Cairo
    working were a mere episode of that career. We were carrying out the orders of the Secret
    Chiefs by exposing the G.'. D.'. and publishing its Ritual, but I was sheltering myself
    from <em>The Book of the Law</em> by taking advantage of a phrase in the text which
    insists: &quot;All this and a book to say how thou didst come</p>
    <p>{541}</p>
    <p>hither and a reproduction of this ink and paper for ever-for in it is the word secret
    &amp; not only in the English ...&quot; And the manuscript had been lost!</p>
    <p>As the sequel will show, the gods knew when to lay their hands on it. I surrendered at
    discretion, re-obligated myself and in September 1909 wrote my greatest magical poem
    &quot;Aha!&quot; in which the Cairo working is restored to its proper place in my life. I
    have made many insurrections since then; but they have always been quelled in very short
    order and punished as they deserved.</p>
    <p>This lengthy preamble will enable the reader to fit into their proper places the
    ostensibly incoherent events of 1907 and 1908. My own continuous illness, the birth of
    Lola Zaza and the tragedy of Rose had combined to complicate my ordinary business, making
    it impossible for me to think of making any new plans for exploration. My affairs in
    Scotland had fallen into great confusion through the extravagance and dishonesty of my
    factor. While the cat was away the mice had been extremely busy.</p>
    <p>Fuller and I had clearly understood the imminence of the world catastrophe. We did not
    exactly know where civilization would begin to crack, or when; we were content to leave
    such speculations to the Prophet Baxter, the Rev. Booth Clibborn and such small deer. But
    we saw the New Zealander sitting on the ruined arch of London Bridge quite clearly.</p>
    <p>We could also see the Professor of Archaeology in the University of Lhasa excavating
    the ruins of the British Museum. He discovered a vast number of volumes of our period
    purporting to deal with the occult sciences, but there were few indeed of these which had
    not crumbled into dust. Of those that remained, the vast majority were evidently
    frivolous. He rejoiced exceedingly to discover one series of volumes, the dignity of whose
    appearance, the permanence of whose paper, the excellence of whose printing, and the
    evident care which had been bestowed on their production, showed him at first sight that
    the people responsible for their production had been at infinite pains to make these
    volumes testify against the tyranny of time<strong>1</strong>. He had them taken to his
    camp with the greatest care. Although he could not read a word of the letterpress, the
    illustrations were in the universal language, which he could read at sight. The first
    standard work of reference --- the key to the wisdom of the buried past.</p>
    <p>With this vision before us, we determined on making our record of the highest
    attainments of human spirits of our generation as worthy as possible of its subject. It
    annoyed us that we could not engrave our knowledge on ten thousand slabs like those at
    Mandalay, but we determined to do our best. We decided on a fount of type, a size of page
    and a quality of paper which could not fail to impress the professors of posterity, and we
    determined that our prose should be so simple,so dignified and so sublime that it would
    stand out from the slipshod journalism of the period as the Alhambra above</p>

      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Here Crowley refers to the preferred manner of his publication.
        Yet he never understood the nature of binding, and looked to hand-made papers that yellow
        and mold in the damp. He sought fine leather for the covers, but the stitchings were of
        linen and the glue such as to fail with age. The first edition of &quot;The Equinox</a>&quot; tends to fall apart at the touch!</font></li>

    <p>the hovels of the vermin that surround it. The scheme required capital, and though I
    was already somewhat embarrassed by the habit of buying a black egg without haggling, I
    did not hesitate to put my hand in my pocket.</p>
    <p>Fuller was at this time in grave difficulties, <em>à la d'Artagnan</em>, but he gave
    his time and his toil with magnificent generosity. His draughtmanship, within certain
    limits, was miraculously fine. Certain subjects were altogether beyond him; he could not
    portray the human figure. His &quot;Adonai-Ha-Aretz&quot; is lamentable, but his symbolic
    drawing shows the highest qualities of imagination and execution, and his geometrical work
    is almost inconceivably perfect. His four Watch Towers (<em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, no. VII</a>) and similar illustrations are superb,
    and his ornamental alphabet is altogether beyond me to appreciate. Unfortunately, his
    prose was florid and confused, and he suffered acutely from what I call the &quot;comma
    bacillus&quot;. He loved a sentence so much that he could not persuade himself to finish
    it, but his images are more vivid and virile than those of any writer I have ever known.</p>
    <p>The style of <em>The Star in the West</em> is trenchant and picturesque. Its only fault
    is a tendency to overloading. I could have wished a more critical and less adoring study
    of my work; but his enthusiasm was genuine, and guaranteed our personal relations in such
    sort that my friendship wit him is one of the dearest memories of my life. I dedicated <em>The
    Winged Beetle</em> to him.</p>
    <p>Alas, I did not take into account the corrupting influence of women. He held out a long
    while against the insidious pressure of his wife. It was perhaps only through the
    treachery of another man that mischief was finally made between us. But nothing can
    destroy the past, and the long years of our intimate friendship were indeed fertile. We
    saw each other nearly every day and worked together in perfect harmony.</p>
    <p>In &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King&quot; Fuller's style was already much improved,
    though the story of my life might have been set forth more simply. Though his tendency to
    burst out into ecstatic rhapsodies resulted in disordering the proportions of its events,
    in the main his task was admirably accomplished, and there are passages of astonishing
    sublimity, not only in the matter of language but in that of thought. His point of view
    was indeed more subtle and profound than he himself realized. I am sure that many passages
    of this book will stand among the greatest monuments of English prose extant.</p>
    <p>But he reached his high-water mark with &quot;The Treasure House of Images&quot;.
    Formally, this is the most remarkable prose that has ever been written. Each chapter of
    the main part of the book contains thirty sections, and each section has the same number
    of syllables. Each of these chapters hymns the sign of the Zodiac and in each section that
    sign is modified by another sign. It is the most astonishing achievement in symbolism.</p>
    <p>{544}</p>
    <p>But this is not all. There is a chapter containing one hundred and sixty-nine cries of
    Adoration, which is, as it were, a multiplication of the previous chapters and a
    quintesentialization of them. To this day we chant these Adorations to the sound of the
    tom-tom and dance to the music, and the effect is to carry away the performer into the
    sublimest ecstasy. It possesses all the Magick of oriental religious rites, such as those
    of the Sidi Aissawa, but the rapture is purely religious. It is not confused with
    eroticism, and that although many of the symbols are of themselves violently erotic.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, when our friendship was interrupted so was his literary career. I had
    taught him to write prose, but he has been able to employ his talents to no better purpose
    than to win prizes in competitions organized by the Army Council.</p>
    <p><em>The Star in the West</em> was published in 1907 and was widely reviewed; for the
    most part, favourably. In particular, Soror S. S. D. D. (Mrs. Emery or &quot;Florence
    Far&quot; as she was variously known) wrote a very full criticism of it in the <em>New Age</em>.
    Some of it is so prophetic that it must be quoted here:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It is a hydra-headed monster, this London Opinion, but we should not be at all
      surprised to see an almost unparalleled event, namely, everyone of those hydra-heads
      moving with a single purpose, and that the denunciation of Mr. Aleister Crowley and all
      his works.</p>
      <p>Now this would be a remarkable achievement for a young gentleman who only left
      Cambridge quite a few years ago. It requires a certain amount of serious purpose to stir
      Public Opinion into active opposition, and the only question is, has Mr. Crowley a serious
      purpose? ...</p>
      <p>Such are some of the sensations described by Aleister Crowley in his quest for the
      discovery of his Relation with the Absolute. His power of expression is extraordinary; his
      kite flies, but he never fails to jerk it back to earth with some touch of ridicule or
      pathos which makes it still an open question whether he will excite that life-giving
      animosity on the part of Public Opinion which, as we have hinted, is only accorded to the
      most dangerous thinkers.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I was enormously encouraged by this article. I knew how serious my purpose was. She had
    reassured me on the point where my faith wavered. I had become so accustomed to columns of
    eloquent praise from the most</p>
    <p>{544}</p>
    <p>important people in the world of letters, which had not sold a dozen copies; to long
    controversial criticism from such men as G. K. Chesterton, which had fallen absolutely
    flat. People acquiesced in me as the only living poet of any magnitude. (There were many
    better known and more highly reputed poets --- Francis Thompson, W. B. Yeats, Rudyard
    Kipling, and later John Masefield, Rupert Brooke and other small fry, whose achievement at
    the best was limited by the narrowness of their ambitions. I at least was aiming at the
    highest.)</p>
    <p>Yet hardly anyone had read any of my work and the intrigues of my enemies had made it
    impossible for me to make myself heard. I never cease to wonder at the persistence of
    malignant hostility on the part of people who have never met me or read a line of my
    writing. I cannot see why people should pursue me with secret slander, often of a kind
    which carries its own refutation with it. To give one instance: It was said it was my
    practice to lure men into the Himalayas for <em>weekends</em> ... I always returned alone!</p>
    <p>There seemed no limit to the lies that were circulated about me. As to motive, I can
    only imagine that it was partly the revenge of the G.'. D.'. rebels whom I had smashed,
    and, subsequently, Mathers and his gang when it became my duty to put a stop to their
    swindling and blackmail; partly to my <em>intransigence</em> about other forms of
    quackery. I had not spared the English Alpine Club or the pretenders to literary eminence.
    I kept myself aloof from cliques and simply refused to admit the existence of the people
    who were playing at being poets, novelists and philosophers.</p>
    <p>But I had learnt intolerance of all pretence and humbug from Eckenstein who had on me
    somewhat the influence that Athos had on d'Artagnan. Whenever I was tempted to derogate in
    any way from the highest standards of honour, the thought always came to me that I could
    not face Eckenstein if I failed. My family, my college and my friend have always been my
    mentors; but, above all, my friend! His severity was fortified by his clear sight; no
    subterfuge was possible with him. He taught me to judge my conduct by the most austere
    standards of rectitude and nobility. It is not too much to say that he created my moral
    character. I had a fatal tendency to find excuses for myself. He forced me always to face
    the facts and keep ceaseless vigil over the jewel of honour.</p>
