    <p>During the May term of 1898 I met another man who, in his own way,&nbsp; was interested
    in many of the same things as I was myself.&nbsp; His name was&nbsp; Gerald Festus Kelly.
    &nbsp; He is described in the telephone book as an artist;&nbsp; and the statement might
    have passed unchallenged indefinitely had not the&nbsp; Royal Academy recently elected him
    as an associate.&nbsp; He is hardly to be&nbsp; blamed for this disgrace.&nbsp; He
    struggled manfully.&nbsp; Even at the last&nbsp; moment, when he felt the thunderclouds
    about to break over his head, he&nbsp; made a last desperate coup to persuade the world
    that he was an artist by&nbsp; marrying a model.&nbsp; But the device deceived nobody.
    &nbsp; The evidence of his&nbsp; pictures was too glaring.&nbsp; The effort, moreover,
    completely exhausted his&nbsp; power of resistance; and he received the blow with
    Christian resignation.&nbsp; It saddens me more hat I can say to think of that young life
    which opened&nbsp; with such brilliant promise, gradually sinking into the slough of
    &nbsp; respectability.&nbsp; Of course it is not as if he had been able to paint; but
    &nbsp; to me the calamity is almost as distressing as if that possibility had&nbsp; ever
    existed.&nbsp; For he completely hypnotized me into thinking that he had&nbsp; something
    in him.&nbsp; I took his determination to become an artist as&nbsp; evidence of some trace
    of capacity and I still hope that his years of&nbsp; unremitting devotion to a hopeless
    ambition will earn him the right to&nbsp; reincarnate with some sort of soul.</p>
    <p>We met in a somewhat romantic way.&nbsp; My <em>Aceldama</em> had just been issued
    &nbsp; and was being sold privately in the university at half-a-crown.&nbsp; (There &nbsp;
    were only eighty-eight copies, with ten on large paper and two on vellum.) &nbsp; One of
    the mottoes in <em>Aceldama</em> is a quotation from Swinburne's &quot;The&nbsp;
    leper&quot;.&nbsp; I had not acknowledged the authorship of <em>Aceldama</em>; it was by
    A&nbsp; Gentleman of the University of Cambridge&quot; in imitation of one of
    Shelley's&nbsp; earlier books.</p>
    <p>Now, there was a bookseller in the town with whom I had few dealings,&nbsp; for he was
    the most nauseatingly hypocritical specimen of the pushing&nbsp; tradesman that I ever set
    eyes on.&nbsp; He was entirely irreligious and did a&nbsp; considerable business in the
    kind of book which is loathsomely described&nbsp; as &quot;curious&quot;.&nbsp; But he was
    out to get the clerical and academic custom and&nbsp; to this end adopted a dress and
    manner which would have been affected in&nbsp; the sweetest of young curates. &nbsp;
    Somehow or other, a copy of <em>Aceldama</em> got&nbsp; into his hands; he showed it to
    Kelly, who was so excited by the quotation&nbsp; from Swinburne that he found out who I
    was, and a meeting was arranged.&nbsp; His knowledge of both art and literature was
    encyclopaedic, and we became</p>
    <p>{150}</p>
    <p>very intimate, projecting collaboration in an Arthurian play and a new&nbsp; magazine
    to take the place of <em>The Yellow Book</em> and <em>The Savoy</em>, which had &nbsp;
    died with Beardsley.&nbsp; Noting much came of this at the time, but the &nbsp; meeting
    had in it the germs of important developments.&nbsp; The critical event &nbsp; of the year
    was my meeting with Oscar Eckenstein at Wastdale Head.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein was a man twenty years older than myself.&nbsp; His business in&nbsp; life
    was mathematics and science, and his one pleasure mountaineering.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was
    probably the best all-round man in England, but his achievements were&nbsp; little known
    because of his almost fanatical objection to publicity.&nbsp; He&nbsp; hated
    self-advertising quacks like the principal members of the Alpine&nbsp; Club with an
    intensity which, legitimate as it was, was almost overdone.&nbsp; His detestation of every
    kind of humbug and false pretence was&nbsp; an&nbsp; overmastering passion.&nbsp; I have
    never met any man who upheld the highest&nbsp; moral ideals with such unflinching candour.</p>
    <p>We did a few climbs together that Easter and made a sort of&nbsp; provisional agreement
    to undertake an expedition to the Himalayas when&nbsp; occasion offered.&nbsp; He had been
    a member of the Conway expedition of 1892,&nbsp; but had quitted the party at Askole,
    principally on account of his disgust&nbsp; with its mismanagement.&nbsp; The separation
    was engineered, moreover, from the&nbsp; other side.&nbsp; For what reason has never been
    clearly explained.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; evidently be improper to suggest that they had
    made up their minds to&nbsp; record at least a partial success and did not want an
    independent witness&nbsp; to their proceedings on the&nbsp; glacier.</p>
    <p>One incident of that expedition is well worth mentioning.&nbsp; A survey&nbsp; was
    being made with instruments which lacked various essential parts, and&nbsp; on Eckenstein
    pointing out the uselessness of making observations of this&nbsp; kind, the reply was,
    &quot;Yes, I know, but it's good enough for the Royal&nbsp; Geographical Society.&quot;
    &nbsp; Anything of this sort roused Eckenstein to a pitch&nbsp; of indescribably violent
    rage.&nbsp; I could not have had a better teacher in&nbsp; matters of conscience.&nbsp; He
    taught me thoroughness and accuracy in every&nbsp; department of the game.</p>
    <p>It illustrate one point.&nbsp; I had considered myself a very good&nbsp; glissader, and
    as compared with the other people whom I met on the&nbsp; mountain side, even such experts
    as Norman Collie, I had little to learn.&nbsp; But Eckenstein showed me that I was not
    even a beginner.&nbsp; He made me start&nbsp; down assorted slopes from all sorts of
    positions, and to pick myself up&nbsp; into any other desired position; to stop, to
    increase my pace or to jump,&nbsp; at the word of command.&nbsp; Why &quot;starting from
    all sorts of positions&quot;?&nbsp; The&nbsp; idea was that one might conceivably fall on
    to a snow slope or have to&nbsp; jump to it from a great height, and it was therefore
    &nbsp; necessary to know&nbsp; how to deal with such situations<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>{151}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1</strong>&nbsp; See <em>The Diary
    of a Drug Fiend</em>, pp. 159-60.</p>
    <p>The combination was ideal.&nbsp; Eckenstein had all the civilized&nbsp; qualities and I
    all the savage ones.&nbsp; He was a finished athlete; his right&nbsp; arm, in particular,
    was so strong that he had only to get a couple of&nbsp; fingers on to a sloping ledge of
    an overhanging rock above his head and he&nbsp; could draw himself slowly up by that alone
    until his right shoulder was&nbsp; well above those fingers.&nbsp; There is a climb on the
    east face of the Y-&nbsp; shaped bolder (so called because of a forked crack on the west
    face) near&nbsp; Wastdale Head Hotel which he was the only man to do, though many quite
    &nbsp; first-rate climbers tried it.&nbsp; Great as his strength was, he considered it
    &nbsp; as nothing, quoting a Bavarian schoolmaster of his acquaintance, who could &nbsp;
    tear a silver florin in half with his fingers.</p>
    <p>He was rather short and sturdily built.&nbsp; He did not know the meaning&nbsp; of the
    word &quot;fatigue&quot;.&nbsp; He could endure the utmost hardship without&nbsp; turning
    a hair.&nbsp; He was absolutely reliable, either as leader or second&nbsp; man, and this
    quality was based upon profound and accurate calculations.&nbsp; He knew his limitations
    to a hair's breadth.&nbsp; I never saw him attempt&nbsp; anything beyond his powers; and I
    never knew him in want of anything from&nbsp; lack of foresight.</p>
    <p>He had a remarkable sense of direction, thought inferior to my own.&nbsp; But his was
    based upon rational considerations, that is to say, he could&nbsp; deduce where north was
    from calculations connected with geology, wind and&nbsp; the law of probabilities; whereas
    my own finer sense was purely psychical&nbsp; and depended upon the subconscious
    registration in my brain as to the&nbsp; angles through which my body had turned during
    the day.</p>
    <p>One point, however, is not covered by this explanation, nor can I&nbsp; find anything
    satisfactory or even plausible.&nbsp; For instance, one day (not&nbsp; having seen
    moonrise that month or in the district) we attempted to climb&nbsp; the Yolcan di Colima;
    we had sent back our <em>mozos</em> with the camp to&nbsp; Zapotlan, intending to cross
    the mountain to the ranch of a gentleman to&nbsp; whom we had introductions.&nbsp; We had
    watched the volcano for a week and&nbsp; more, in the hope of discovering some periodicity
    in its eruptions, which&nbsp; we hailed to do.&nbsp; We accordingly took our chance and
    went across the&nbsp; slopes until the rocks began to burn our feet through our boots.
    &nbsp; We&nbsp; recognized that it was hopeless to proceed.</p>
    <p>We decided to make for the farm and soon reached a belt of virgin&nbsp; jungle where
    the <em>chapparal</em> and fallen timber made it almost impenetrable.&nbsp; The trees were
    so thick that we could rarely see the sky.&nbsp; The only&nbsp; indication for progress
    was to keep on down hill.&nbsp; The slopes were&nbsp; amazingly complicated, so that at
    any moment we might have been facing&nbsp; east, south or west.&nbsp; The dust of the
    rotten timber almost choked and&nbsp; blinded us.&nbsp; We suffered tortures from thirst,
    our water supply being&nbsp; extremely limited.&nbsp; Night fell; it was impossible to see
    our hands in&nbsp; front of us.&nbsp; We accordingly lit a fire to</p>
    <p>{152}</p>
    <p>keep off the jackals and other possibilities, which we heard howling round&nbsp; us.
    &nbsp; We naturally began to discuss the question of direction; and I said, &nbsp;
    &quot;The moon will rise over there&quot;, and laid down my axe as a pointer. &nbsp;
    Eckenstein independently laid down his, after a rather prolonged mental &nbsp;
    calculation.&nbsp; When the moon rose we found that my axe was within five &nbsp; degrees
    and his within ten degrees of the correct direction.&nbsp; This was &nbsp; only one of
    many such tests; and I do not see in the least how I knew, &nbsp; especially as astronomy
    is one of the many subjects of which my knowledge&nbsp; is practically nil.&nbsp; In spite
    of innumerable nights spent under the stars,&nbsp; I can recognize few constellations
    except the Great Bear and Orion.</p>
    <p>Besides my sense of direction on the large scale, I have a quite&nbsp; uncanny faculty
    for picking out a complicated route through rocks and ice&nbsp; falls.&nbsp; This is not
    simply a question of good judgment; for in any given&nbsp; route, seen from a distance,
    there may always be a passage, perhaps not&nbsp; twenty feet in height, which would &nbsp;
    render the whole plan abortive.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is especially the case with ice falls,
    where much of the route is&nbsp; necessarily hidden from view.&nbsp; Obviously, one cannot
    see what is on the&nbsp; other side of a s&#130;rac whose top one has theoretically
    reached.&nbsp; Yet I have&nbsp; never been wrong; I have never been forced to turn back
    from a climb once&nbsp; begun.</p>
    <p>I have also an astonishing memory for the minutest details of any&nbsp; ground over
    which I have passed.&nbsp; Professor Norman Collie had this quality&nbsp; very highly
    developed, but he paid me the compliment of saying that I was&nbsp; much better than he
    was himself.&nbsp; This too, was in my very early days when&nbsp; he was teaching me many
    quite rudimentary points in the technique of rock&nbsp; climbing.&nbsp; Again, we have a
    question of subconscious physical memory.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am often quite unable to describe
    even the major landmarks of a climb&nbsp; which I have just done, but I recognize every
    pebble as I come to it if&nbsp; asked to retrace my steps.&nbsp; Efforts on my part to
    bring up a mountain into&nbsp; clear consciousness frequently create such a muddle in my
    mind that I&nbsp; almost wonder at myself.&nbsp; I make such grotesque mistakes that I am
    not far&nbsp; from doubting whether I have been on the mountain at all: yet my limbs
    &nbsp; possess a consciousness of their own which is infallible.&nbsp; I am reminded
    &nbsp; of the Shetland ponies (see Wilkie Collin's <em>The Two Destinies</em>) which
    can&nbsp; find their way through the most bewildering bogs and mist.&nbsp; This faculty
    &nbsp; is not only retrospective --- I can find my way infallibly over unknown &nbsp;
    country in any weather.&nbsp; The only thing that stops me is the interference &nbsp; of
    my conscious mind.</p>
    <p>I have several other savage faculties; in particular, I can smell&nbsp; snow and water,
    though for ordinary things my olfactory sense is far below&nbsp; the average.&nbsp; I
    cannot distinguish perfectly familiar perfumes in many&nbsp; cases; that is, I cannot
    connect them with their names.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein and I were both exceedingly expert at describing what lay</p>
    <p>{153}</p>
    <p>behind any mountain at which we might be looking.&nbsp; In his case, the&nbsp;
    knowledge was deduced scientifically; in mine, it was what one must call&nbsp; sheer
    clairvoyance. &nbsp; The nearest I could get to understanding his methods&nbsp; was
    judging by the glow above the ridge of a mountain whether the other&nbsp; side was
    snow-covered, and estimating its steepness and the angle of its&nbsp; rocks by analogy
    with the corresponding faces of the mountains behind us,&nbsp; or similar formations
    elsewhere. &nbsp; I should hardly be necessary to point&nbsp; out the extraordinary
    practical value of these qualities in deciding one's&nbsp; route in unknown country.</p>
    <p>In the actual technique of climbing, Eckenstein and I were still more &nbsp;
    complementary.&nbsp; It is impossible to imagine two methods more opposed. &nbsp;
    His&nbsp; climbing was invariably clean, orderly and intelligible; mine can hardly &nbsp;
    be described as human.&nbsp; I think my early untutored efforts, emphasized by &nbsp; my
    experience on chalk, did much to form my style.&nbsp; His movements were a &nbsp; series,
    mine were continuous; he used definite muscles, I used my whole&nbsp; body. &nbsp; Owing
    doubtless to my early ill-health, I never developed physical&nbsp; strength; but I was
    very light, and possessed elasticity and balance to an&nbsp; extraordinary degree.</p>
    <p>I remember going out on Scafell with a man named Corry.&nbsp; He was the&nbsp; ideal
    athlete and had gone through a course of Sandow; but had little&nbsp; experience of
    climbing at that time.&nbsp; I took him up the North Climb of&nbsp; Mickledoor. &nbsp;
    There is one place where, while hunting for holds, one&nbsp; supports oneself by an arm
    stretched at full length into a crack.&nbsp; The arm&nbsp; is supported by the rock and
    the hand grasps a hold as satisfactory as a&nbsp; sword hilt.&nbsp; The inconceivable
    happened; Corry fell off and had to be&nbsp; replevined by the rope.&nbsp; I was amazed,
    but said nothing.&nbsp; We continued the&nbsp; climb and, reaching the top of the Broad
    Stand, took off the rope.&nbsp; By way&nbsp; of exercise, I suggested climbing a short,
    precipitous pitch above a&nbsp; sloping slab.&nbsp; There was no possible danger, it was
    within the powers of a&nbsp; child of six; but Corry came off again.&nbsp; I was standing
    on the slab and&nbsp; caught him by the collar as he passed on his way to destruction.</p>
    <p>After that, we put on the rope again and returned by descending, I&nbsp; think,
    Mickledoor Chimney.&nbsp; On the way down to Wastdale, he was strangely&nbsp; silent and
    embarrassed, but finally he made up his mind to ask me about&nbsp; it.</p>
    <p>&quot;Do you mind if I feel your arm?&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;It must be a
    marvel.&quot;</p>
    <p>I complied and he nearly fainted with surprise.&nbsp; My muscles were in&nbsp; quantity
    and quality like those of an early Victorian young lady.&nbsp; He&nbsp; showed my his own
    arm.&nbsp; There could not have been a finer piece of anatomy&nbsp; for manly strength.
    &nbsp; He could not understand how, with everything in his&nbsp; favour, he had been
    unable to maintain his grip on the best holds in&nbsp; Westmorland.</p>
    <p>A curious parallel to this incident happened in 1902 on the&nbsp; expedition</p>
    <p>{154}</p>
    <p>to Chogo Ri.&nbsp; We had an arrangement by which a pair of ski could be&nbsp;
    converted into a sledge for convenience in hauling baggage over snow-&nbsp; covered
    glaciers. &nbsp; When the doctor and I proposed to move from Camp 10 to&nbsp; Camp 11 we
    set up this sledge and packed seven loads on it.&nbsp; We found it&nbsp; quite easy to
    pull. &nbsp; This was clearly an economy of five porters and we&nbsp; started two men up
    the slope.&nbsp; To our astonishment they were unable to&nbsp; budge it.&nbsp; They called
    for assistance; until the whole seven were on the&nbsp; ropes.&nbsp; Even so, they had
    great difficulty in pulling the sledge and&nbsp; before they had gone a hundred yards
    managed to upset in into a crevasse&nbsp; They settled the matter by taking two loads
    (between 100 and 120 pounds)&nbsp; each and went off quite merrily.&nbsp; It is useless to
    have strength unless&nbsp; you know how to apply it.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein recognized from the first the value of my natural&nbsp; instincts for
    mountaineering, and also that I was one of the silliest&nbsp; young asses alive. &nbsp;
    Apart from the few priceless lessons that I had had&nbsp; from Collie, I was still an
    amateur of the most callow type.&nbsp; I had no&nbsp; idea of system.&nbsp; I had achieved
    a good deal, it is true, but a mixture of&nbsp; genius and common sense; but I had no
    regular training and was totally&nbsp; ignorant of the serious business of camp life and
    other branches of&nbsp; exploration.</p>
    <p>We arranged to spend the summer in a tent on the Sch&quot;nb&#129;hl glacier &nbsp;
    under the Dent Blanche, primarily with the idea of fitting me for the &nbsp; Himalayan
    expedition, and secondarily with that of climbing the east face&nbsp; of the Dent Blanche
    by a new route which he had previously attempted with&nbsp; Zurbriggen. &nbsp; They had
    been stopped by a formation which is exceedingly&nbsp; curious and rare in the Alps ---
    slopes of very soft snow set in an&nbsp; unclimbable angle.&nbsp; He thought that my
    capacity for swimming up places of&nbsp; this sort might enable us to bag the mountain.</p>
    <p>I hope that Eckenstein has left adequate material for a biography and&nbsp; made
    arrangements for its publication.&nbsp; I had always meant to handle the&nbsp; matter
    myself.&nbsp; But the unhappy termination of his life in phthisis and&nbsp; marriage, when
    he had hoped to spend its autumn and winter in Kashmir&nbsp; meditating upon the mysteries
    which appealed to his sublime spirit, made&nbsp; all such plans nugatory.</p>
    <p>I fell it one of my highest duties to record in these memoirs as much&nbsp; as possible
    relative to this man, who, with Allan Bennett, stands apart&nbsp; from and above all
    others with whom I have been really intimate.&nbsp; The&nbsp; greatness of his spirit was
    not inferior to that of such giants as Rodin;&nbsp; he has an artist no less than if he
    had actually produced any monument to&nbsp; his mind.&nbsp; Only his constant manhandling
    by spasmodic asthma prevented him&nbsp; from matching his genius by masterpieces.&nbsp; As
    it is, there is an immense&nbsp; amount in his life mysterious and extraordinary beyond
    anything I have&nbsp; ever known.&nbsp; For instance, during a number of years he was the
    object of&nbsp; repeated murderous</p>
    <p>{155}</p>
    <p>attacks which he could only explain on the hypothesis that he was being&nbsp; mistaken
    for somebody else.I must record one adventure, striking not only in itself, but because
    &nbsp; it is of a type which seems almost as universal as the &quot;flying dream&quot;.
    &nbsp; It&nbsp; possesses the quality of the phantasmal.&nbsp; It strikes me as an
    adventure&nbsp; which in some form or other happens to a very large number of men; which
    &nbsp; occurs constantly in dreams and romances of the Stevensonian order.&nbsp; For
    &nbsp; instance, I cannot help believing that something of the kind has happened&nbsp; to
    me, though I cannot say when, or remember the incidents.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; written the
    essence of it in &quot;The Cream Cricean&quot;; and some phantasm of&nbsp; similar texture
    appears to me in sleep so frequently that I wonder whether&nbsp; its number is less than
    one weekly, on the average.&nbsp; Sometimes it&nbsp; perpetuates itself night after night,
    recognizable as itself despite&nbsp; immense variety of setting, and haunting my waking
    hours with something&nbsp; approaching conviction that it represents some actuality.</p>
    <p>This story is briefly as follows.&nbsp; One night after being attacked in&nbsp; the
    streets of Soho, or the district between that section of Oxford street&nbsp; and the
    Euston Road, he determined, in case of a renewed assault, to walk&nbsp; home by a
    roundabout and unfamiliar route.&nbsp; Somewhere in the neighbourhood&nbsp; of the
    Caledonian Road he thought that he was being followed --- it was&nbsp; not late at night
    and somewhat foggy.&nbsp; To make sure, he turned into a&nbsp; narrow passage on to which
    opened the gardens of a row of houses, in one,&nbsp; and only one, of which lights were
    visible.&nbsp; The garden door of this house&nbsp; was open and he dodged in to see
    whether the men he suspected were&nbsp; following.&nbsp; Two figures appearing at the end
    of the passage, he quietly&nbsp; closed the door behind him with the intention of entering
    the house,&nbsp; explaining his position and asking to be allowed to leave by the front
    &nbsp; door.&nbsp; The door was opened by a young and beautiful woman in fashionable
    &nbsp; evening dress.&nbsp; She appeared of good social position and, on his &nbsp;
    explaining himself, asked him to sty to supper.&nbsp; He accepted.&nbsp; No servants&nbsp;
    appeared, but on reaching the dining-room --- which was charmingly &nbsp; furnished and
    decorated with extremely good pictures, Monet, Sisley and&nbsp; the like, with sketches or
    etchings by Whistler, all small but admirable&nbsp; examples of those masters --- he found
    a cold supper for two people was&nbsp; laid out. &nbsp; Eckenstein remained for several
    hours, in fact until daylight,&nbsp; when he left with the understanding that he would
    return that evening.&nbsp; He&nbsp; made no note of the address, the street being familiar
    to him and his&nbsp; memory for numbers entirely reliable.&nbsp; I think that he was
    somehow&nbsp; prevented from returning the same evening; I am not quite sure on this&nbsp;
    point.&nbsp; But if so, he was there twenty-four hours later.&nbsp; He was surprised&nbsp;
    to find the house in darkness and astounded when no further inspection he&nbsp; saw a
    notice &quot;To Let&quot;.&nbsp; He knocked and rang in vain.&nbsp; Assuming that he&nbsp;
    must have mistaken the number, unthinkable as the</p>
    <p>{156}</p>
    <p>supposition was, he explored the adjacent houses, but found nothing.&nbsp; Annoyed and
    intrigued, he called on the agent the next morning and visited&nbsp; the house.&nbsp; He
    recognized it as that of his hostess.&nbsp; Even the lesser&nbsp; discolorations of the
    wallpaper where the bookcase and pictures had been&nbsp; testified to the identity of the
    room.&nbsp; The agent assured him that the&nbsp; house had not been occupied for three
    months.&nbsp; Eckenstein pointed to&nbsp; various tokens of recent occupancy.&nbsp; The
    agent refused to admit the&nbsp; conclusion.&nbsp; They explored the back part of the
    premises and found the&nbsp; French windows through which Eckenstein had entered, and the
    garden gate,&nbsp; precisely as he had left them.&nbsp; On inquiry it appeared that the
    house was&nbsp; vacant owing to the proprietor (a bachelor of some sixty years old, who
    &nbsp; had lived there a long while with a man and wife to keep house for him) &nbsp;
    having been ordered to the south of France for the winter.&nbsp; He had led a &nbsp; very
    retired life, seeing no company; the house had been furnished in&nbsp; early Victorian
    style.&nbsp; Only the one room where Eckenstein had had supper&nbsp; was
    unfurnished.&nbsp; The agent explained this by saying that the old man had&nbsp; taken the
    effects of his study with him to France, for the sake of their&nbsp; familiarity.</p>
    <p>The mystery intrigued Eckenstein immensely and he returned several&nbsp; times to the
    house.&nbsp; A month or so later he found the two servants had&nbsp; returned.&nbsp; The
    master was expected back in the spring.&nbsp; They denied all&nbsp; knowledge of any such
    lady as described; and there the mystery rests, save&nbsp; that some considerable time
    later Eckenstein received a letter, unsigned,&nbsp; in evidently disguised handwriting.
    &nbsp; It contained a few brief phrases to&nbsp; the effect that the writer was sorry, but
    it could not be helped; that&nbsp; there was no hope for the future, but that memory would
    never fade.&nbsp; He&nbsp; connected this mysterious communication with his hostess,
    simply because&nbsp; he could not imagine any other possibility.</p>
    <p>I can offer no explanation whatever, but I believe every word of the&nbsp; story, and
    what is most strange is that I possess an impenetrable&nbsp; conviction that something
    almost exactly the same must have happened to&nbsp; me.&nbsp; I am reminded of the one
    fascinating episode which redeems the once-&nbsp; famous but excessively stupid and
    sentimental novel <em>Called Back</em> from&nbsp; utterly abject dullness.&nbsp; There is
    also an admirable scene in one of&nbsp; Stevenson's best stories, &quot;John
    Nicholson&quot;.&nbsp; A similar theme occurs in <em>Dr.&nbsp;Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde</em>,
    &quot;The Sire de Malétroit's Door&quot;, and &quot;A lodging for &nbsp; the
    Night&quot;.&nbsp; There are similar ideas in oriental and classical
    literature.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fascination of the central idea thus seems a positive
    obsession to&nbsp; certain minds.</p>
    <p>Is it somehow symbolic of a widespread wish or fear?&nbsp; Is it, as in&nbsp; the case
    of the Oedipus complex, the vestige of a racial memory --- &quot;In&nbsp; the beginning
    was the deed&quot;?&nbsp; (This phrase magnificent concludes Freud's <em>Totem and Taboo</em>.)&nbsp;
    Or can it be the actual memory of an event in some&nbsp; previous incarnation or in some
    other illusion than what we call real&nbsp; life?</p>
    <p>{157}</p>
    <p>In the course of writing this story down, the impression of personal&nbsp; reminiscence
    has become steadily stronger.&nbsp; I now recall clearly enough&nbsp; that I have actually
    experienced not one but many such adventures, that&nbsp; is, as far as the spiritual
    essence is concerned.&nbsp; I have repeatedly,<br>
    sometimes by accident but more often on purpose, gone into the wrong room&nbsp; or the
    wrong house, with the deliberate intention of finding romance.&nbsp; More often than not,
    I have succeeded.&nbsp; As to the sequel, I have often&nbsp; enough failed to return; and
    here again sometimes the fore of&nbsp; circumstances has been responsible, sometimes
    disinclination; but, most&nbsp; frequently of all, through the operation of that imp of
    the perverse whom&nbsp; I blame elsewhere in this book for occasional defeats at chess.
    &nbsp; I have&nbsp; wished to go, I have made every preparation for going, I have perhaps
    &nbsp; reached the door, and then found myself powerless to enter.&nbsp; Stranger &nbsp;
    still, I have actually returned; and then, despite the strongest conscious &nbsp; efforts
    to &quot;recapture the first fine careless rapture&quot; of the previous &nbsp; visit,
    behaved in such a way as to make it impossible.</p>
    <p>I have never been baffled by any such inexplicable incident as the&nbsp; abandonment of
    the room, though I have sometimes failed to find the&nbsp; expected girl.</p>
    <p>Talking the whole matter over with my guide, philosopher and friend,&nbsp; Frater
    O.P.V., he finds the whole story extraordinarily gripping.&nbsp; He&nbsp; finds the
    situation nodal for the spirit of romance.&nbsp; An extraordinary&nbsp; number of vital
    threads or &quot;nerves&quot; of romance.</p>
    <p>He attaches great significance to the failure of Eckenstein to keep&nbsp; the
    appointment.&nbsp; It seems to him as if the whole business were a sort of&nbsp; magical
    ordeal, that Eckenstein should have been awake to the miraculous&nbsp; character of the
    adventure and kept his appointment though hell itself&nbsp; yawned between him and the
    house.&nbsp; The main test is his realization that&nbsp; the incident is high Magick, that
    if he fail to grasp its importance, to&nbsp; understand that unless he return that night
    the way will shut fro ever.&nbsp; He suggests that by failing to appreciate the
    opportunity at its full&nbsp; value he had somehow missed the supreme chance of his life,
    as if the&nbsp; &quot;wrong house&quot; were the gateway to another world, an inn, so to
    speak, on&nbsp; the outskirts of the City of God.&nbsp; In recent years I have been
    constantly&nbsp; alert and on the look-out for something of the kind.&nbsp; Whenever my
    plans&nbsp; are disarranged by a number of apparently trivial and accidental &nbsp;
    circumstances, I look eagerly for the possibility that the situation to&nbsp; which they
    lead may prove the opening scene in some gigantic drama.&nbsp; Numerous episodes in these
    memoirs illustrate this thesis.&nbsp; One might even&nbsp;&nbsp; say that the whole book
    is a demonstration of how the accumulation and&nbsp; consequence of large numbers of
    apparently disconnected facts have&nbsp; culminated in bringing &quot;the time and the
    place, and the loved one all&nbsp; together&quot;.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein's parents had escaped from Germany in '48, or thereabouts,&nbsp; as
    political exiles, or so I imagine; I do not remember any details.&nbsp; But&nbsp; he was
    educated at Bonn and knew Bloody Bill intimately.&nbsp; This luckless&nbsp; despot</p>
    <p>{158}</p>
    <p>was at that time a young man of extraordinary promise, taking himself with&nbsp; the
    utmost seriousness as realizing the gigantic responsibilities of his&nbsp; inheritance.
    &nbsp; He was intensely eager to fit himself to do his best for&nbsp; Germany.&nbsp; He
    was openminded and encouraged Eckenstein's endeavours to&nbsp; introduce eight-oared
    rowing into the university, and used his influence&nbsp; to obtain permission of officers
    to lay by their swords when playing&nbsp; tennis.</p>
    <p>One incident amuses me greatly.&nbsp; Students were exempt from the general law and
    could not be punished for any act which was not mentioned&nbsp; by name in the
    statues.&nbsp; The brighter spirits would then accordingly&nbsp; search the statues for
    gaps.&nbsp; It was, for instance, <em>strengstens verboten</em>&nbsp; to tie
    night-watchmen to lightning conductors during thunderstorms.&nbsp; Eckenstein and his
    friends waited accordingly for the absence of&nbsp; thunderstorms and then proceeded to
    tie up the watchmen.</p>
    <p>He was as thoroughly anglicized as possible.&nbsp; The chief mark of the&nbsp; old Adam
    was a tendency to professional dogmatism.&nbsp; When he felt he was&nbsp; right, he was
    almost offensively right; and on any point which seemed to&nbsp; him settled, the
    coefficient of his mental elasticity was zero.&nbsp; He could&nbsp; not imagine the
    interference of broad principles with the detailed results&nbsp; of research.&nbsp; The
    phrase &quot;general principles&quot; enraged him.&nbsp; He insisted on&nbsp; each case
    being analysed by itself as it arose.&nbsp; This is all right, but it&nbsp; is possible to
    overdo it.&nbsp; There are many circumstances which elude&nbsp; analysis, yet are
    perfectly clear if examined in the light of the&nbsp; fundamental structure of the human
    organism.&nbsp; For all that, he was exactly&nbsp; the man that I needed to correct my
    tendency to take things for granted,&nbsp; to be content with approximations, to jump at
    conclusions, and generally&nbsp; to think casually and loosely.&nbsp; Besides this, my
    experience of his moral&nbsp; and intellectual habits was of the greatest service to me,
    or rather to&nbsp; England, when it was up to me to outwit Hugo Münsterberg.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein's moral code was higher and nobler than that of any other&nbsp; man I have
    met.&nbsp; On numerous points I cannot agree; for some of his ideas&nbsp; are based on the
    sin complex.&nbsp; I cannot imagine where he got it from, he&nbsp; with his rationalistic
    mind from which he excluded all the assumptions of&nbsp; established religion.&nbsp; But
    he certainly had the idea that virtue was&nbsp; incompatible with enjoyment.&nbsp; He
    refused to admit that writing poetry was&nbsp; work, though he admired and loved it
    intensely.&nbsp; I think his argument must&nbsp; have been that if a man enjoys what he is
    doing, he should not expect&nbsp; extra remuneration.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein share the idiosyncrasies of certain very great men in&nbsp; history. &nbsp;
    He could not endure kittens.&nbsp; He did not mind grown-up cats.&nbsp; The feeling was
    quite irrational and conferred mysterious powers! for he&nbsp; could detect the presence
    of a kitten by means of some sense peculiar to&nbsp; himself.&nbsp; We used to tease him
    about it in the manner of the young, who&nbsp; never understand that anything may be
    serious to another person which is&nbsp; not so to them.&nbsp; One</p>
    <p>{159}</p>
    <p>Easter the hotel was overcrowded; and five of us, including Eckenstein and&nbsp;
    myself, were sleeping in the barn.&nbsp; One of Eckenstein's greatest friends&nbsp; was
    Mrs. Bryant, whose beautiful death between Chamonix and Montanvers in&nbsp; 1922 was the
    crown of a noble life.&nbsp; She had brought her niece, Miss&nbsp; Nichols, who to
    intrepidity on rocks added playfulness in less austere&nbsp; surroundings.&nbsp; I
    formally accuse her of putting a kitten under&nbsp; Eckenstein's pillow in the barn while
    we were in the smoking-room after&nbsp; dinner.&nbsp; If it had been a cobra Eckenstein
    could not have been more upset!</p>
    <p>He had also an idiosyncrasy about artificial scent.&nbsp; One day my wife&nbsp; and a
    friend came home from shopping.&nbsp; They had called at the chemist's&nbsp; who had
    sprayed them with &quot;Shem-el-nessim&quot;.&nbsp; We saw them coming and went&nbsp; to
    the door to receive them.&nbsp; Eckenstein made one rush --- like a bull ---&nbsp; for the
    window of the sitting-rrom, flung it open and spent the next&nbsp; quarter of an hour
    leaning out and gasping for breath.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein was a great connoisseur of puzzles.&nbsp; It is extremely&nbsp; useful, by
    the way, to be able to occupy the mind in such ways when one&nbsp; has not the
    conveniences or inclination for one's regular work, and there&nbsp; is much time to kill
    in a hotel or a tent in bad weather.&nbsp; Personally, I&nbsp; have found chess solitaire
    and triple-dummy bridge or skat as good as&nbsp; anything.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein was a recognized authority on what is known as Kirkwood's schoolgirl
    problem, but we used to work all sorts of things, from problems&nbsp; connected with
    Mersenne's numbers and Fermat's binary theorem to thepurely frivolous attempt to represent
    any given number by the use of the&nbsp; number four, four times --- neither more nor
    less, relating them by any of&nbsp; the accepted symbols of mathematical operations.&nbsp;
    Thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>18 = 4 (4.4) + .4<br>
            38 = 14 + . + 4<br>
            106 = ³4 + 4.4 .4<br>
            128 = 44ö4-Sq.Rt.of &#08; 4</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>his has been done up to about 170, with the exception of the number 113, and thence to
    300 or thereabouts with only a few gaps.&nbsp; I solved 113 with the assistance of Frater
    Psi and the sue of a subfactorial, fur Eckenstein would not admit the use of this symbol
    as fair.</p>
    <p>He was also interested in puzzles involving material apparatus, one of which seems
    worth mention.&nbsp; He was in Mysore and a travelling conjurer sold him a whole bundle of
    more or less ingenious tricks.&nbsp; One of these consisted simply of two pieces of wood;
    one a board with a hole in it, the other shaped somewhat like a dumb-bell, the ends being
    much too big to go through the hole. &nbsp; Eckenstein said that he was almost ready to
    swear that he saw the man take them up separately and rapidly put them together,</p>
    <p>{160}</p>
    <p>in which condition he had them and was never able to take them apart.&nbsp; He explored
    the surface minutely for signs of complexity of structure but without success.&nbsp; I
    never saw the toy, he having sent it to Mr. W. W. Rouse Ball, a great authority on such
    matters, but also baffled in this case.</p>
    <p>We were naturally always interested in any problems concerned with the working out of a
    difficult route, and here his probity on one occasion made him the victim of an
    unscrupulous child of Shaitan.&nbsp; The villain appeared in the guise of an old and
    valued friend, saying &quot;Is it possible to reach Q from P (mentioning two places in
    London) without passing a public house?&quot;&nbsp; Eckenstein accordingly took his walks
    in that direction and after endless trouble discovered a roundabout way which fulfilled
    the condition.&nbsp; Communicating the joyful news, his friend replied, &quot;Good for
    you!&nbsp; Here's something else.&nbsp; Can you get to the Horseshoe, Tottenham Court
    Road, from here without passing a public house?&quot;&nbsp; I do not know how many pairs
    of alpine boots Eckenstein wore out on the problem, before asking his friend, &quot;Can it
    be done?&quot;&nbsp; A telegram assured him that it could.&nbsp; More boots went the way
    of all leather and then he gave up. &quot;It's perfectly easy,&quot; said the false
    friend, <em>don't</em> pass them --- go in!&quot;</p>
    <p>(The psychologist will observe that this atrocious piece of misplaced humour was made
    possible by the earlier problem having been genuine, difficult and interesting, thus
    guaranteeing the spoof.)</p>
    <p>One of his favourite amusements was to calculate the possibility of some published
    description of a phenomenon.&nbsp; For instance, in the novel &quot;She&quot; here is a
    &quot;rocking stone&quot; about which there are sufficient data in the book to enable an
    expert to say whether it was possible in nature.&nbsp; He decided that it was, but only on
    the assumption that it was a cone balanced on its apex.</p>
    <p>I suppose that every form of navigation possesses its peculiar dangers.&nbsp; I
    remember Eckenstein telling me of an adventure he once had with Legros.&nbsp; One might be
    tempted to think that very little harm could come to a barge in a dock on the Thames, bar
    being cut down by a torpedo ram.&nbsp; But the facts are otherwise.&nbsp; It was the first
    time that either of them had been in charge of this species of craft, which they had to
    manoeuvre in&nbsp; order to inspect a wharf which required some slight repair.&nbsp; The
    gallant little wave-waltzer displaced a hundred and twenty tons and was called the <em>Betsy
    Anne</em>.</p>
    <p>They boarded the barge without difficulty, but to get her going was another matter.
    &nbsp; The fellow-countrymen of Cook, drake and Nelson were not behindhand with wise
    advice couched in language of frankness and fancy. They learned that the way to make a
    barge go was to walk up and down the broad flat gunwale with a pole.&nbsp; She was
    certainly very hard to start; but it got easier as she gathered way.&nbsp; They entered
    into the spirit of the sport and began to run up and down with their poles, exciting each
    other to emulation with cheerful laughter.&nbsp; Pride filled their souls as they observed</p>
    <p>{161}</p>
    <p>that their rapid mastery of the awkward craft was appreciated on shore, as the lusty
    cheering testified.&nbsp; It encouraged them to mightier efforts and before long they must
    have been making well over two miles an hour.&nbsp; Then Eckenstein's quick ear asked him
    whether the shouting on shore was so wholly the expression of unstinted admiration as he
    had supposed.&nbsp; He paid greater attention and thought he detected yells of coarse
    ridicule mingled with violent objurgation.&nbsp; He thought he heard a word at the
    conclusion of a string of extremely emphatic epithets which might easily have been
    mistaken for &quot;Fool!&quot;&nbsp; At this point Legros stopped poling, said shortly and
    unmistakably &quot;Hell!&quot; and pointed to the wharf, which, as previously stated,
    stood in need of some trifling repairs.&nbsp; It was now not more than fifty yards away
    and seemed to them to be charging them with the determination of an angry elephant. &nbsp;
    They realized the danger and shouted for advice.&nbsp; The answer was, in essence,
    &quot;Dive!&quot;&nbsp; It was, of course, hopeless to attempt to check or even to deflect
    the <em>Betsy Anne</em>.&nbsp; They dived, and a moment later heard the rending crash of
    the collision, and were nearly brained by baulks of falling timber. &nbsp;
    &quot;Well,&quot; said Eckenstein, a they drove home to change their muddy garments,
    &quot;We've done a good morning's work, anyhow.&nbsp; That wharf is no longer in need of
    trifling repairs.&quot;&nbsp; Both it and the <em>Betsy Anne</em> kept the neighbourhood
    in matchwood for the next two years.&nbsp; Oh! for a modern Cowper to immortalize the
    maritime John Gilpin!</p>
