    <p>Nothing gives such a mean idea of the intelligence of mankind than that it should ever
    have accepted for a moment the imbecile illusion of &quot;free will&quot;; for there can
    be very few men indeed, in any generation, who have at any time in their lives sufficient
    apparent liberty of action to induce them to dally with it. Of these few, I was one. When
    I left Cambridge, I had acquired no particular ties. I was already the Spirit of Solitude
    in in embryo. Practically, too, my father having been the younger son of a younger son, I
    had not even a territorial bond. On the other hand, I had a large fortune entirely at my
    own disposal; there was no external constraint upon me to do one thing rather than
    another. And yet, of course, my career was absolutely determined. The events of my life up
    to that point, it they had been intelligently interpreted, would have afforded ample
    indications of the future. I was white-hot on three points; climbing, poetry and Magick.</p>
    <p>On my return from Switzerland in 1898, I had nowhere in particular to go. There was no
    reason why I should settle down in any special place. I simply took a room in the Cecil,
    at that remote period a first-class hostelry, and busied myself with writing on the one
    hand and following up the magical clues on the other. <em>Jephthah</em>, and most of the
    other poems which appear in that volume, were written about this period. It is a kind of
    backwater in my life. I seem to have been marking time. For this reason, no doubt, I was
    the more ready to be swept away by the first definite current. It was not long before it
    caught me.</p>
    <p>I had a number of conversations with Julian Baker, who kept his promise to introduce me
    to &quot;a man who was a much greater Magician than he was himself&quot;. This was a
    Welshman, named George Cecil Jones. He possessed a fiery but unstable temper, was the son
    of a suicide, and bore a striking resemblance to many conventional representations of
    Jesus Christ. His spirit was both ardent and subtle. He was very widely read in Magick;
    and, being by profession an analytical chemist, was able to investigate the subject in a
    scientific spirit. As soon as I found that he really understood the matter I went down to
    Basingstoke, where he lived, and more or less sat in his pocket. It was not long before I
    found out exactly where my destiny lay. The majority of old magical rituals are either
    purposely unintelligible or actually puerile nonsense<strong>1</strong>. Those which are
    straightforward and workable</p>
    <p>{172}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Some are doubtless survivals of various forms of nature religion;but the
        majority are adaptations of Catholic or Jewish traditions to the ambitions, cupidities,
        envies, jealousies and animal instincts of the most ignorant and primitive type of
        peasant.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>are, as a rule, better adapted to the ambitions of love-sick agricultural labourers
    than those of educated people with a serious purpose. But there is one startling exception
    to this rule. It is <em>The Book of the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin the Mage</em>.</p>
    <p>This book is written in an exalted style. It is perfectly coherent; it does not demand
    fantastic minutiae of ritual or even the calculations customary. There is nothing to
    insult the intelligence. On the contrary, the operation proposed is of sublime simplicity.
    The method is in entire accordance with this. There are, it is true, certain prescriptions
    to be observed, but these really amount to little more than injunctions to observe decency
    in the performance of so august an operation. One must have a house where proper
    precautions against disturbance can be taken; this being arranged, there is really nothing
    to do but to aspire with increasing fervour and concentration, for six months, towards the
    obtaining of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once He has
    appeared, it is then necessary, first, to call forth the Four Great Princes of the Evil of
    the World; next, their eight sub-princes; and, lastly, the three hundred and sixteen
    servitors of these. A number of talismans, previously prepared, are thus charged with the
    power of these spirits. By applying the proper talismans, you can get practically anything
    you want.</p>
    <p>It cannot be denied that the majesty and philosophical irreproachability of the book
    are sensibly diminished by the addition of these things to the invocation of the Holy
    Guardian Angel. I should have preferred it without them. There is, however, a reason.
    Anyone who reaches a new world must conform with all the conditions of it. It is true, of
    course, that the hierarchy of evil appears somewhat repugnant to science. It is in fact
    very hard to explain that we mean by saying that we invoke Paimon; but, to go a little
    deeper, the same remark applies to Mr. Smith next door. We do not know who Mr. Smith is,
    or what is his place in nature, or how to account for him. We cannot even be sure that he
    exists. Yet, in practice, we call Smith by that name and he comes. Buy the proper means,
    we can induce him to do for us those things which are consonant with his nature and
    powers. The whole question is, therefore, one of practice; and by this standard we find
    that there is no particular reason for quarrelling with the conventional nomenclature.</p>
    <p>At this time I had not worked out any such apology for the theories of
    transcendentalism. I took everything as it came and submitted it to the test of
    experience. As it happened, I had no reason at any time to doubt the reality of the
    magical universe. I began my practical work with astral visions and found to my surprise
    that after half a dozen experiments I was better than my teacher.</p>
    <p>In these days I took my Magick very much <em>au pied de la lettre</em>. I knew, of</p>
    <p>{173}</p>
    <p>course, that Magick had fallen into desuetude chiefly because people would follow the
    prescribed course of action and get no result. An exquisitely amusing incident bearing on
    this point is as follows: Gerald Kelly, Ivor Back and one or two other ardent spirits,
    inspired by my success, decided to do Magick themselves. They hired and furnished a room
    at Cambridge for the purpose and proceeded to evoke various spirits. Nothing happened. At
    last one of the greatly daring extended his little finger outside the circle. He was not
    &quot;slain or paralysed as if blasted by the lightning flash&quot; and thence concluded
    that Magick was all rubbish. I offer this example to logic to the Museum of Human
    Imbecility, in the principal city of the Astral Plane.</p>
    <p>I understood perfectly well that Back and Kelly, having no capacity for Magick, were
    bound to fail either to evoke a spirit or to get themselves blasted. If one does not
    understand anything about electricity, one cannot construct a dynamo; and having so
    failed, one cannot get oneself electrocuted.</p>
    <p>But I suppose that their failure and my success was mostly a matter of personal genius,
    just as Burns with hardly any literary apparatus could write poetry, and Tennyson, with
    any amount, could not.</p>
    <p>My success itself helped to blind me to the nature of the conditions of achievement. It
    never occurred to me that the problem of Magick contained metaphysical elements.</p>
    <p>Consider my performance one evening at Eastbourne. Having waited for the lowest
    possible tide so as to be as remote as might be from the bandstand, I made a circle and
    built an altar of stones by the edge of the sea. I burned my incense, performed my
    evolutions and made heaven hideous with my enchantments. All this in order to invoke the
    Undines. I hoped, and more or less expected, to have one come out of the foam and attach
    herself to my person. I had as yet no notion that this programme might be accomplished far
    more easily.</p>
    <p>There are thus two main types of mistake; one in spirit and one in technique. Most
    aspirants to Magick commit both. I soon learned that the physical conditions of a magical
    phenomenon were like those of any other; but even when this misunderstanding is removed,
    success depends upon one's ability to awaken the creative genius which is the inalienable
    heirloom of every son of man, but which few indeed are able to assimilate to their
    conscious existence, or even, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, to detect.</p>
    <p>The only Undine that appeared was a policeman, who approached near enough to observe a
    fantastically garbed figure, dancing and howling in the moonlight &quot;on the silvery,
    silvery, silvery sands&quot;; howling, whistling, bellowing and braying forth the
    barbarous names of evocation which have in the sacred rites a power ineffable, around a
    furiously flaming bonfire whose sparks were whirled by the wind all over the beach.</p>
    <p>The basis of the delusion is that there is a real apodeictic correlation between the
    various elements of the operation, such as the formal manifestation of the spirit, his
    name and sigil, the form of the temple, weapons, gestures and incantations. These facts
    prevent one from suspecting the real subtlety involved in the hypothesis. This is so
    profound that it seems almost true to say that even the crudest Magick eludes
    consciousness altogether, so that when one is able to do it, one does it without conscious
    comprehension, very much as one makes a good stroke at cricket or billiards. One cannot
    give an intellectual explanation of the rough working involved, as one can explain the
    steps in the solution of a quadratic equation. In other words Magick in this sense is
    rather an art than a science.</p>
    <p>Jones realized at once that I had a tremendous natural capacity for Magick, and my
    every action proved that I intended to devote myself to it &quot;without keeping back the
    least imaginable thing&quot;. He suggested that I should join the Body of which he was an
    adept; known, to a few of the more enlightened seekers, ass the Hermetic Order of the
    G.·. D.·.. A short account of this Order is necessary. Most of the facts concerning it
    are given here and there in <em>The Equinox</em>; but the story is so lengthy and complex
    that it would require a volume to itself. Briefly, however, the facts are as follows:</p>
    <p>Some time in the 'seventies or 'eighties, a cipher manuscript was found on a bookstall
    by a Dr. Woodman, a colleague in magical study of Dr. W. Wynn Westcott. It was beyond
    their powers to decipher it, though Mrs. Emery (Miss. Florence Farr) told me that a child
    could have done so. They called in a man named Samuel Liddell Mathers, a scholar and
    Magician of considerable eminence. The manuscript yielded to his scrutiny. It contained,
    among minor matters, the rubric of certain rituals of initiation and the true attribution
    of the Tarot Trumps. This attribution had been sought vainly for centuries. It cleared up
    a host of Qabbalistic difficulties, in the same was as Einstein's admirers claim that his
    equations have done in mathematics and physics. The manuscript gave the name and address
    of an adept Sapiens Dominabitur Astris, a Fräulein Sprengel, living in Germany, with an
    invitation to write to her if further knowledge was required. Dr. Westcott wrote; and
    S.D.A. gave him and his two colleagues a charter authorizing them to establish an Order in
    England. This was done. Soon after, S.D.A. died. In reply to a letter addressed to her,
    came an intimation from one of her colleagues that they had never approved her policy in
    permitting open-temple work in England, but had refrained from active opposition from
    personal respect for her. The writer ended by saying that England must expect no more
    assistance from Germany; enough knowledge had been granted to enable any English adept to
    form a Magical Link with the Secret Chiefs. Such competence would evidently establish a
    right to renewed relations.</p>
    <p>{175}</p>
    <p>Dr. Woodman had died and Mathers forced Dr. Westcott to retire from active leadership
    of the Order. Mathers, however, was not trusted. He, therefore, announced to the most
    advanced adepts that he had himself made the Magical Link with the Secret Chiefs; and, at
    an interview with three of them in the Bois de Boulogne, had been confirmed in the supreme
    and sole authority as the Visible Head of the Order. The adepts entrusted with this
    information were required to sign a pledge of personal obedience to Mathers as a condition
    of advancement in the Order. Nevertheless, dissatisfaction continued. The advancement did
    not arrive. They suspected that Mathers had no more knowledge to give; and he retorted
    that, however that might be, he wasn't going to waste it on such hopeless differs. Both
    positions have much to recommend them to discriminating sympathy.</p>
    <p>These petty squabbles apart, a big thing had happened. Mathers had discovered the
    manuscript of <em>Abra-Melin</em> in the library of the Arsenal in Paris and begun to
    translate it1. He found himself harassed and opposed on all sides. In those days there was
    practically no public way of getting about Paris at all. Mathers lived at Auteuil, a long
    way from the Arsenal, and met with so many bicycle accidents that he was driven to go on
    foot. (There is always occult opposition to the publication of important documents. It
    took me over three years to get my <em>The Goetia</em> through the press, and over two
    years in the case of <em>777</em>. This is one of the facts whose cumulative effect makes
    it impossible to doubt the existence of spiritual forces.) Other misfortunes of every kind
    overwhelmed Mathers. He was an expert Magician and had become accustomed to use the
    Greater Key of Solomon with excellent effect. He did not realize that <em>Abra-Melin</em>
    was an altogether bigger proposition. It was like a man, accustomed to handle gunpowder,
    suddenly supplied with dynamite without being aware of the difference. He worried through
    and got <em>Abra-Melin</em> published; but he perished in the process. He became the prey
    of the malignant forces of the book, lost his integrity and was cast out of the Order of
    which he had been the visible head.</p>
    <p>This debacle had not yet taken place at the time of my first initiation, November 18th,
    1898.</p>
    <p>I took the Order with absolute seriousness. I was not even put off by the fact of its
    ceremonies taking place at Mark Mason's Hall. I remember asking Baker whether people often
    died during the ceremony. I had no idea that it was a flat formality and that the members
    were for the most part muddled middle-class mediocrities. I saw myself entering the Hidden
    Church of the Holy Grail. This state of my soul served me well. My initiation was in fact
    a sacrament.</p>
    <p>The rituals have been printed in <em>The Equinox</em>, vol. I, Nos. II and III. There
    is no question that those of neophyte and adept are the genuine rituals of initiation, for
    they contain the true formulae. The proof is that they can be</p>
    <p>{176}</p>
    <p><font size="2">1 WEH Note: At least that's what Mathers said. According to G.Sholem in
    his &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, English and Hebrew versions have been found in British
    collections known to have been consulted by Mathers. It is conjectured that Mathers faked
    the translation of the Old French version from the library of the Arsenal to obtain
    translator's remuneration from the eventual publisher. Mathers did the same thing with the
    &quot;Greater Key of Solomon&quot; and an excerpt from the &quot;Lesser Key of
    Solomon,&quot; called &quot;The Goetia&quot; and subsequently published by Crowley.
    Mathers plagiarized the whole of his famous introduction to &quot;The Kabbalah
    Unveiled&quot; from Christian D. Ginsburg's essay &quot;The Kabbalah; Its Doctrines,
    Development and Literature&quot;. These practices appear to be endemic to the time.</font></p>
    <p>made to work by those who understand and know how to apply them. Shallow critics argue
    that because the average untrained man cannot evoke a spirit, the ritual which purports to
    enable him to do so must be at fault. He does not reflect that an electroscope would be
    useless in the hands of a savage. Indubitably, Magick is one of the subtlest and most
    difficult of the sciences and arts. There is more opportunity for errors of comprehension,
    judgment and practice than in any other branch of physics. It is above all needful for the
    student to be armed with scientific knowledge, sympathetic apprehension and common sense.
    My training in mathematics and chemistry supplied me with the first of these qualities; my
    poetic affinities and wide reading with the second; while, for the third, I suppose I have
    to thank my practical ancestors.</p>
    <p>Being thus able to appreciate the inmost intention of my initiation, I was able to
    stand the shock of the events immediately subsequent. I was introduced to an abject
    assemblage of nonentities; the members of the Order were as vulgar and commonplace as any
    other set of average people. Jones and Baker themselves were the only members with any
    semblance of scientific education, until, a few months later, I met Allan Bennett, a mind
    pure, piercing and profound beyond any other in my experience. There was one literary
    light, W. B. Yeats, a lank dishevelled demonologist who might have taken more pains with
    his personal appearance without incurring the reproach of dandyism; and one charming and
    intelligent woman, Mrs. Emery, for whom I always felt an affectionate respect tempered by
    a feeling of compassion that her abilities were so inferior to her aspirations. The rest
    of the Order possessed no individuality; they were utterly undistinguished either for
    energy or capacity. There is not one of them today who has made any mark in the world.</p>
    <p>At my initiation, I could have believed that these adepts deliberately masked their
    majesty; but there was no mistaking the character of the &quot;knowledge lecture&quot; in
    which I had to be examined to entitle me to pass to the next grade. I had been most
    solemnly sworn to inviolable secrecy. The slightest breach of my oath meant that I should
    incur &quot;a deadly and hostile current of will, set in motion by the Greatly Honoured
    Chiefs of the Second order, by the which I should fall slain or paralysed, as if blasted
    by the lightning flash&quot;. And now I was entrusted with some of these devastating
    though priceless secrets. They consisted of the Hebrew alphabet, the names of the planets
    with their attribution to the days of the week, and the ten Sephiroth of the Cabbala. I
    had known it all for months; and, obviously, any schoolboy in the lower fourth could
    memorize the whole lecture in twenty-four hours.</p>
    <p>I see today that my intellectual snobbery was shallow and stupid. It is vitally
    necessary to drill the aspirant in the groundwork. He must be</p>
    <p>{177}</p>
    <p>absolutely familiar with the terminology and theory of Magick from a strictly
    intellectual standpoint. I still think, however, that this course of study should precede
    initiation and that it should not be mixed up with it. Consider the analogy of poetry. One
    could, to a certain extent, teach a man to write poetry, by offering to his soul a set of
    spiritual and emotional experiences, but his technique must be based on the study of
    grammar and so on, which have no essential relation with art.</p>
    <p>Talking over these matters with Jones and Baker, I found them quite in sympathy with my
    pint of view; but they insisted, rightly enough, that I was not in a position to judge the
    circumstances. I must first reach the Second Order.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, I took the grade of Zelator in December, of Theoricus in January and of
    Practicus in February. One could not proceed to Philosophus for three months, so I did not
    take that grade till May. The Philosophus cannot proceed to the Second Order in less than
    seven months; also he must be specially invited.</p>
    <p>In the spring of 1899, at some ceremony or other, I was aware of the presence of a
    tremendous spiritual and magical force. It seemed to me to proceed from a man sitting in
    the east, a man I had not seen before, but whom I knew must be Very Honoured Frater Iehi
    Aour, called among men Allan Bennett. The fame of this man as a Magician was already
    immense. He was esteemed second only to Mathers himself; and was, perhaps, even more
    feared.</p>
    <p>After the ceremony we went into the outer room to unrobe. I was secretly anxious to be
    introduced to this formidable Chief. To my amazement he came straight to me, looked into
    my eyes, and said in penetrating and, as it seemed, almost menacing tones: &quot;Little
    Brother, you have been meddling with the Goetia!&quot; (Goetia means &quot;howling&quot;;
    but it is the technical word employed to cover all the operations of that Magick which
    deals with gross, malignant or unenlightened forces.) I told him, rather timidly, that I
    had not been doing anything of the sort. &quot;In that case,&quot; he returned, &quot;the
    Goetia has been meddling with you.&quot; The conversation went no further. I returned home
    in a somewhat chastened spirit; and, having found out where Iehi Aour lived, I determined
    to call on him the following day.</p>
    <p>I should have explained that, on deciding to join the Order, I had taken a flat at 67
    and 69 Chancery Lane<strong>1</strong>. I had already determined to perform the Operation
    of <em>Abra-Melin</em>, but Jones had advised me to go through my</p>
    <p>{178}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">My innocence after three years at Cambridge may be gaged by my conduct in
        the matter of choosing a residence. I understood it as a fixed principle of prudence,
        &quot;When in a difficulty consult your lawyer.&quot; Knowing nothing, whatever about
        renting apartments, I was in a difficulty. I therefore consulted my lawyer and too the
        first place he suggested. He, of course, never gave a though to my convenience or the
        appropriateness of the district. He saw and took the chance of obliging a business
        acquaintance.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>initiation first. However, I began to busy myself with the preparations. <em>Abra-Melin</em>
    warns us that our families will object strenuously to our undertaking the Operation. I
    resolved, therefore, to cut myself off absolutely from mine. So, as I had to live in
    London, I took the flat under the name of Count Vladimir Svareff. As Jones remarked later,
    a wiser man would have called himself Smith. But I was still obsessed with romanticism,
    while my summer in St. Petersburg had made me in love with Russia. There was another
    motive behind this --- a legitimate one. I wanted to increase my knowledge of mankind. I
    knew how people treated a young man from Cambridge. I had thoroughly appreciated the
    servility of tradesmen, though I was too generous and too ignorant to realize the extent
    of their dishonesty and rapacity. Now I wanted to see how people would behave to a Russian
    nobleman. I must say here that I have repeatedly used this method of disguise --- it has
    been amazingly useful in multiplying my points of view about humanity. Even the most
    broad-minded people are necessarily narrow in this one respect. They may know how all
    sorts of people treat them, but they cannot know, except at second hand, how those same
    people treat others.</p>
    <p>To return to Allan Bennett</a>. I found him staying
    with V. H. Frater Aequo Animo<strong>1</strong> in a tiny tenement in Southwark or Lambeth
    --- I forget which. It was a mean, grim horror. AE. A., whose name was Charles Rosher, was
    a widely travelled Jack-of-all-trades. He had invented a patent water-closet and been
    court painter to the Sultan of Morocco. He wrote some of the worst poetry I have ever
    read. He was a jolly-all-round sportsman with an excellent heart and the cheery courage
    which comes from knocking about the world, and being knocked about by it. If his talents
    had been less varied, he might have made a success of almost anything.</p>
    <p>{179}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">I ultimately conjectured: Equi Animo: &quot;with the soul of a
        horse&quot;.</font></li>
