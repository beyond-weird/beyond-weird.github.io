    <p>On the thirteenth of July I went to Edinburgh, partly to renew my stock of wines and
    partly to pick up some kind of companion-housekeeper, but ostensibly toe meet Gerald Kelly
    who was due to spend the summer at Strathpeffer. His sister Rose was engaged to a man
    named Howell, who was coming from America to marry her in a few weeks.</p>
    <p>I engaged a companion-housekeeper easily enough. What a man wants is a woman whom he
    can take down from the shelves when required and who can be trusted to stay on them when
    not. It is true that a woman is much more amusing when she possesses individuality and
    initiative, but it is the basest kind of sensuality to wish to be amused. The ideal woman
    should prevent a man from being amused or disturbed in any way, whether by his won
    passions or the incidents of everyday life. I forget the surname of the lady whom I chose
    to fill this important position. Let her stand in history by the unassuming title of
    &quot;Red-headed Arabella&quot;. It was arranged that she should come and take up her
    duties towards the middle of August. I only stayed two or three days in Edinburgh and,
    having attended to the matter of wine and woman, completed the triad by writing <em>The
    God-Eater</em>.</p>
    <p>This sort play is singularly unsatisfactory as a work of art, but extremely significant
    as a piece of autohagiography. The explanatory note in my <em>Collected Works</em> is
    itself obscure.</p>
    <p>The idea of this obscure and fantastic play is a follows: By a glorious act human
    misery is secured (history of Christianity).</p>
    <p>Hence, appreciation of the personality of Jesus is no excuse for being a Christian.</p>
    <p>Inversely, by a vile and irrational series of acts human happiness is secured (story of
    the play).</p>
    <p>Hence, attacks on the mystics of history need not cause us to condemn mysticism.</p>
    <p>Also, the knowledge of good and evil is a tree whose fruit man has not yet tasted: so
    that the devil cheated Eve indeed; or (more probably) Eve cheated Adam. Unless (most
    probable of all) God cheated the devil and the fruit was a common apple after all.
    (&quot;Cf&quot;. H. Maudsley, <em>Life in Mind and Conduct</em>.)</p>
    <p>The influence of <em>The Golden Bough</em> and the Spencerian philosophers whom I was
    reading is apparent. In the last paragraphs, too, is evidence that I still</p>
    <p>{360}</p>
    <p>clung to Shelley's dream of a regenerated humanity. There is a touch of the influence
    of a man named L. C. R. Duncombe Jewell, the eldest son of a Plymouth Brother at
    Streatham, who had &quot;gone to the bad&quot; by becoming a Roman Catholic. I had asked
    him to spend a week at Boleskine and he had managed somehow or other to settle down there
    as my factor. I suppose he saved me trouble in one way or another, and was some sort of
    companion. He called himself Ludovic Cameron, being a passionate Jacobite and having a
    Cameron somewhere in his family tree. He was very keen on the Celtic revival and wanted to
    unite the five Celtic nations in an empire. In this political project he had not wholly
    succeeded: but he had got as far as designing a flag. And, oh so ugly!</p>
    <p>All this seemed childish to me, but no more so than imperialism, and it had the
    advantage of being rather charming and entirely harmless. It is strange to look back on
    myself at twenty-seven, completely persuaded of the truth of the most extravagant claims
    of mysticism and magick yet completely disillusioned with regard to the universe. I was
    inclined to minimize my activity in every respect. The importation of Red-headed Arabella
    had only one motive --- to arrange my life so as to reduce the elements of disturbance to
    the lowest possible point.</p>
    <p>It may seem a little strange that I did not follow the example of Allan Bennett and
    take the Yellow Robe. But I had not been favourably impressed by the conditions of
    Buddhist monasteries. It was no doubt true that the regulations laid down by the Buddha
    for the conduct of bhikkhus were intended to help them to free their minds from
    disturbance; but they were no longer interpreted in that light by the Bhikkhus themselves,
    except by an infinitesimal minority, who, like Allan, really understood the machinery of
    the business.</p>
    <p>Nor did I agree that the Buddha was altogether right. I thought it a great mistake to
    interfere with physiological processes. I was perfectly aware that greed, lust and hatred
    were the enemies of peace; but I was also aware that forcing oneself to abstain from food,
    love and society could only result in diverting the natural appetites into abnormal
    channels. St. Anthony attributed an exaggerated importance to sex. I was convinced that
    the repression of natural instincts was an insult to nature and a short cut to moral
    deformity. I already saw that the only proper course of action was to order one's life in
    accordance with its conditions.</p>
    <p>The plan to pursue was to comply with physiological propriety, but to keep each
    appetite in its place, to prevent it from invading the sphere of the whole consciousness.
    In practice, I proposed to live an absolutely normal life, but without attaching undue
    importance to any element of it. I intended to enjoy my dinner, whether it was salmon and
    Chateau Yquem '78, or cold mutton and a glass of milk. I had found by experience that the
    minimum</p>
    <p>{361}</p>
    <p>of disturbance was secured in this way. The agony of sugar starvation on the Baltoro
    glacier had showed met that to try to repress a natural appetite is merely to invite it to
    obsess one.</p>
    <p>I expected then to settle down slowly into a routine of scientific research on the
    lines philosophically indicated by Spencer, Huxley and the Buddha, while morally I
    followed the Rosicrucian principle of complying with the customs of the country through
    which I was travelling.</p>
    <p>The condition of my soul is clearly indicated by my output. The fount of lyric poetry
    had run completely dry. I had not touched the unfinished <em>Orpheus</em>; wrote nothing
    new. I no longer aspired to become the redeemer of humanity. I doubt whether I should have
    been able to attach any meaning to any such words. After returning from Edinburgh, I do
    not seem even to have kept a record and I remember nothing about my doings. July is
    however the date of an essay &quot;The initiated interpretation of ceremonial magick&quot;
    which I prefaced to my edition of <em>The Goetia</em>. I had employed Mathers to translate
    the text of <em>The Lesser Key of Solomon the King</em> of which <em>The Goetia</em> is
    the first section. He got no further; after the events of 1900, he had simply collapsed
    morally. I added a translation of the conjurations into the Enochian or Angelic language;
    edited and annotated the text, prefixed a &quot;Preliminary Invocation&quot;, added a
    prefatory note, a Magical Square (intended to prevent improper use of the book) and
    ultimately an Invocation of Typhon when the First Magical War of the Aeon of Horus was
    declared.</p>
    <p>This essay throws a very clear light upon my position. I could not deny the facts of
    Ceremonial Magick. It is impossible to explain why a dog squeals when you hit him with a
    stick; but we do not therefore deny that this happens, or at least that there is some
    impression of some such kind somewhere. I was in precisely the position of those
    philosophers who were driven to the theory of causality and said that there was no cause
    why an apple should fall; it was simply a matter of coincidence that God should happen to
    will that it should touch the ground after willing it should be detached from the bough.
    The facts of Magick appear quite natural if one accepts the explanation officially put
    forward without inquiring too closely.</p>
    <p>This theory, roughly speaking, is that of Milton or Dante. There is even some excuse
    for saying it is the Catholic tradition <em>à rebours</em>; that tradition is of course
    the development and degradation of various animistic cults. Magical facts were explained
    by the intervention of spiritual beings. One spiritual being, myself, throws a stone. That
    is how it happens that the stone has changed its position. Another spiritual being, Zeus,
    is annoyed; that explains how such and such a house is struck by lightning. All facts are
    of the same order and their interpretation must be uniform.</p>
    <p>Now, I had dismissed the whole theory of spiritual hierarchies as repugnant to reason;
    thus I was left with a set of phenomena on my hands which</p>
    <p>{362}</p>
    <p>cried aloud for explanation, exactly like the man who noticed that rubbed amber
    attracted certain light objects. In this essay, I endeavoured to show how it was the
    Magical Operations were effective. My collection of facts was at that time comparatively
    small and I had not yet analysed and classified them properly. But the essay shows that I
    was on the right track. My interpretation conformed with the mechanical theory of
    Victorian physics.</p>
    <p>The sequel shows my development on the same lines as the rest of modern science. The
    materialists had to include the connotation of &quot;spirit&quot; in their definition of
    &quot;matter&quot;. One of my difficulties was that my senses told me that the archangel
    Gabriel exactly as they told me that Ernst Haeckel existed; in fact, rather more so. I had
    accepted Haeckel on mere hearsay. Why should I doubt Isis, whom I had seen, heard,
    touched; yet admit Ray Lankester, whom I hadn't? already I was compelled to resolve all
    phenomena equally into unknowable impressions. I did not realize how arbitrary it was to
    explain Taphtatharath as a set of impressions somehow imagined by my mind as the result of
    a particular process of intoxication. It was long before I understood that all
    explanations of the universe are ultimately interchangeable like the geometries of Euclid,
    Riemann and Lobatchewsky.</p>
    <p>So much for July. But early in August, Gerald Kelly wrote suggesting that I should join
    his party at Strathpeffer. I had nothing better to do. Red-headed Arabella was still in
    Edinburgh; I was being bored to death, either by my meditation or by my inability to rouse
    myself to the point of doing any. So I packed a bag and went over.</p>
    <p>The party consisted principally of Kelly's mother, who worthily preserved the
    conditions of Tennysonian dignity; Rose, who was in a curious state of excitement, which I
    either failed to observe at all, or attribute to the high spirits of unthinking youth; and
    one or two more or less chance acquaintances, including an elderly solicitor named Hill,
    who was in love with Rose and struck me as perhaps the tamest and dullest specimen of
    humanity that I had ever met. Gerald was playing golf, which at that time was rather
    daring; not quite the thing you would confess to your friends in London. I had no clubs
    and he played mostly with Hill. Thus it happened that at lunch on the eleventh of August
    Rose and I got into conversation. There is something in my character which makes people
    confide in me. I think the bottom of it is my chastity. They instinctively understand that
    I have no personal axe to grind; that I shall display a wise benevolence and incorruptible
    justice, being detached from every form of desire.</p>
    <p>So Rose confessed to me that she was in great trouble, as we wandered out over the
    links to walk the last few holes with Kelly and Hill.</p>
    <p>She told me that she was being forced into the marriage with Howell by her family. She
    had been carrying on an intrigue with a married man named Frank Summers. This had got to
    the ears of her family because,</p>
    <p>{363}</p>
    <p>being hard up for money, she had told her mother that she was pregnant and got forty
    pounds from her for the purpose of having an illegal operation. Naturally, this led to
    inquiries; and though the pregnancy was merely an ingenious pretext, and the operation
    consisted of dinners and dresses, the Kellys were determined to prevent further raids on
    their purse and there prestige by insisting on her remarriage.</p>
    <p>The story awakened my Shelleyan indignation. We sat down on the links in silence while
    I thought out the situation. The solution was perfectly simple. &quot;Don't upset yourself
    about such a trifle,&quot; said I, and told her something of my spiritual state and my
    plans for the future. &quot;All you have to do,&quot; I said, &quot;is marry me. I will go
    back to Boleskine and you need never hear of me again --- unless,&quot; I added with
    romantic grandiloquence, &quot;I can be of any further assistance to you. That will knock
    your marriage with Howell on the head; you will be responsible for your conduct, not to
    your family, but to me (as in the case of an Indian dancing girl married to a dagger or a
    pipal tree); and you can go and live in the flat which Mr. Summers proposes to take for
    you, without interference.&quot;</p>
    <p>It really seems absurd that I should have been so ignorant of the elements of
    psychology; but I genuinely imagined that this fantastic programme was possible. It
    certainly satisfied all theoretical requirements! But like other Utopian dreamers from Sir
    Thomas Browne to Karl Marx, I omitted to take into consideration one insignificant element
    in the problem --- the existence of the mysterious force called human nature.</p>
    <p>Rose jumped at my suggestion. We agreed to tell Gerald as soon as he appeared, which
    was thoughtless, as it might easily have put him off his game, and to get married at the
    earliest possible moment. Gerald finished the course in 4, 3, 4, 4, bogey being 17 for
    that part of the course. He took our announcement as a harmless joke.</p>
    <p>I went to the local authorities about the practical programme; but they were like Ball
    on a celebrated occasion. The only available deity was the parish sexton; and, after all,
    could anything have been more appropriate? He told me that I could have the banns
    published and get married in three weeks. That wouldn't do at all; it would give Howell
    time to arrive from America and put pressure on the Kellys. I asked him if there was not
    some less drawn-out form of execution. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, after scratching his
    head, &quot;you can be expoased on a bnoorrrd along o' yer young 'ooman for a week.&quot;
    Not in vain had I been studying <em>The Golden Bough</em>, but I had no idea that these
    obscene forms of torture still lingered --- even in the Scottish Highlands. &quot;Come,
    come,&quot; I said, &quot;There must be a simpler and quicker way to get married than
    that.&quot; Surely, I said to myself, all that stuff about Gretna Green must have some
    basis in fact. He shook his head sorrowfully, a discomfortable which I checked by slipping
    him a half-crown. He then admitted</p>
    <p>{364}</p>
    <p>that it was only necessary to go to the sheriff of the county and declare the intention
    to get married, in which case the marriage would take place there and then. &quot;There
    and then?&quot; I echoed in a hollow voice, for I had the instinctive feeling natural to a
    young man, that he is somehow or other putting his foot in it, that he is invoking unknown
    gods. &quot;Then and there,&quot; he answered heavily and the syllables fell as if he had
    been throwing the sods upon my coffin.</p>
    <p>Armed with this satisfactory information, I returned to the hotel and had a short
    conference with my betrothed. We were to get up in time to catch the first train to
    Dingwall, call on the sheriff and get it over before breakfast. We carried out this
    design. We had to go quietly for fear of awakening Gerald. The idea was that he might
    interfere, though I had no reason for supposing that he would do so. But apparently she
    had.</p>
