    <p>We came into contact, on one occasion, with the relations between the people and the
    government. The British official in Ceylon is a very different person from his Indian
    colleague. He is not &quot;heaven-born&quot; in the same consecrated and ineluctable way.
    He has failed to convince himself of his superiority to mere created beings; so his airs
    of authority do not become him. He feels himself a bit of an upstart. Ceylon is full of
    half-casts, Dutch, English and Portuguese, and the white man feels himself somehow
    compromised by their presence. They remind him of his poor relations and make him feel as
    the inhabitants of Dayton, Tennessee, and some others do in a monkey-house. A similar
    situation exists in the southern states of America, where the pure whites are outnumbered
    by the negroes, and where a large population of mixed blood provides the logical link. In
    south Africa, again, we find the same situation; and the practical result is that the
    white man, feeling his footing insecure, dares not tolerate the native as he can in India,
    where the relations between the population and the conquering invader are understood by
    both parties. The Singalese government is inclined to be snappish.</p>
    <p>One evening Allan and I were meditating, as usual. The servants were absent for some
    reason; some marauder took the opportunity to break in and steal my cash box. I am ashamed
    to say that I was stupid enough to report the incident to the police. A day or two later
    an alleged inspector appeared, made various inquiries and went off. He took with him my
    pocket compass, under the impression that it was my watch! This time, of course, we could
    identify the thief, who had been playing this game all over the island. He was caught and
    put in the dock; but escaped conviction on some technicality. But I remember the incident
    acutely on account of the conversation I had with the magistrate, who explained that the
    man might be flogged for this offence. He spoke of the punishment with a shudder --- it
    was terrible to witness; but his tones displayed intense sadistic pleasure at the idea. It
    was my first glimpse of the bestial instincts of the average respectable and cultured
    Englishman. I had not really believed what I had read in Krafft-Ebing about perverse
    pleasures of this sort; I could not understand cruelty.</p>
    <p>Is it Gorky who tells us the at the universal characteristic of the Russian is to
    delight in the infliction of pain for its own sake, in the absence of any comparatively
    intelligible basis like anger and hatred? He describes how men's mouths are filled with
    gunpowder and exploded, how women's breasts are pierced, ropes inserted and the victim
    left to hang from the</p>
    <p>{252}</p>
    <p>ceiling. These things are done exactly as English children sometimes torture animals.
    He says that the whole of this life has been poisoned by realizing the existence of this
    instinct, which seemed to him a fatal objection to any possible justification of the
    universe. I cannot follow him so far. I can understand that every possible combination of
    qualities may exist somewhere and that I have no right even to assume that my own
    detestation of such things proves them to be unjustifiable.</p>
    <p>I really rather agree with &quot;Greenland's Icy Mountains&quot;, though I object to
    accepting Ceylon on the penultimate. But certainly every prospect is remarkably pleasing
    and, as far as I saw, every man is vile. There seems to be something in the climate of the
    island that stupefies the finer parts of a man if he lives there too long. The flavour of
    the tea seemed to me somehow symbolic. I remember one day pleading with the local
    shopkeeper to find me some Chinese tea. It chanced that the owner of a neighbouring
    plantation was in the shop. He butted in, remarking superciliously that he could put in
    the China flavour for me. &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;but can you take out the Ceylon
    flavour?&quot;</p>
    <p>Before leaving Eckenstein, I had agreed to consider the question of an Himalayan
    expedition, to Chogo Ri, marked &quot;K2&quot; on the Indian Survey, 28,250 feet, the
    second highest mountain in the world. I decided not to go; wishing to devote myself
    exclusively to spiritual progress. I wrote to this effect; but when I told Allan that I
    had done so, I found, to my surprise, that he thought I ought to go for Eckenstein's sake.
    It was the same problem as that about Abra-Melin and the Order. And I chose ion the same
    way. I wired Eckenstein that I would go.</p>
    <p>One of the results of this was that I began to grow a beard. Eckenstein had put me up
    to a lot of the points of conduct that should be observed in travelling among Mohammedans
    and I practised these conscientiously. For instance, I taught myself never to touch my
    face with my left hand. I found this practice tends to make my mind constantly vigilant.
    Later, I developed the idea into <em>Liber Jugorum</em></a>,&quot;
    which is one of the most important elements in the preliminary training for the A.'. A.'..
    But the Singalese, knowing nothing of our motives, could only conclude that sahibs with
    beards must be Boer prisoners. The same ridiculous mistake was made even by the whites at
    Rawalpindi, when the expedition arrived, though we were mixing freely with them and half
    our party talking English slang.</p>
    <p>The fact is that the vast majority of people are absolutely impervious to facts. Test
    the average man by asking him to listen to a simple sentence which contains one word with
    associations to excite his prejudices, fears or passions --- he will fail to understand
    what you have said and reply by expressing his emotional reaction to the critical word. It
    was long before I understood this fact of psychology. Even to this day, it surprises me
    that there should be minds</p>
    <p>{253}</p>
    <p>which are unable to accept any impression equably and critically. I have heard many
    great orators. The effect has nearly always been to make me wonder how they have the nerve
    to put forward such flimsy falsehoods.</p>
    <p>The excursion to the buried cities was an education in itself. The first impression was
    of the shocking callousness with which the coach horses were treated. There was not a
    single one along the whole route which was even moderately sound. I began to set its right
    value upon the first precept of Buddha: Not to take life. Ass!</p>
    <p>At Dambulla is one of the most extraordinary works of human skill, energy and
    enthusiasm in the world. The temple is a cave in the rock, of vast extent but with a very
    small opening. How could the many statues of the Buddha which filled the cave have got
    there? It was the camel and the needle's eye again. But what had been done was to cut away
    the rock of the cave itself, leaving the statues. So gigantic a conception and so
    admirable an execution extort one's whole-hearted praise. Nothing so drives home the fact
    of modern degeneracy as this: not only are the Singalese of today utterly incapable of
    creative work, but they are so far fallen that they have piously smeared this superb
    statuary with thick coats of gamboge so lavishly that the delicacy of the modelling is
    entirely concealed.</p>
    <p>The rock Sigiri is very startling. It sticks up out of the level jungle without
    apology. It is supposed to by unclimbable save by the artificial gallery which was built
    of old when a city flourished on the summit. We hung about for some days, as I wanted to
    walk round the rock and try and find a way up. But the scheme was impracticable. One could
    not cut one's way through so many miles of thick jungle, and if one did one would have to
    be a monkey to be sure of getting a view.</p>
    <p>The only incident was that I came across my first buffalo. In the course of a ramble, I
    had come out upon a clearing in the forest where there was a shallow lake. A bull with two
    cows arrived simultaneously from the other side, in quest of a drink. In those days I
    carried a Mauser `303. I got within a hundred yards before he took alarm. As he raised his
    head I aimed and fired. The cartridge failed to explode and the bull thundered past me
    before I could reload. If he had been charging --- good night! I took the lesson to heart
    and always carried a double-barrelled rifle ever after. Apart from the extra time needed
    to lower a single-barrelled rifle and manipulate the lever, which might well cause a fatal
    delay, there is more than a possibility of a cartridge jamming, which would leave one
    entirely unarmed.</p>
    <p>We jogged on wearily to Anuradapura. This discomforts of the coach were great, and the
    monotony of the view desolating. It was all an endless flat tangle of vegetation. It was
    delightful to perceive, about sunset, a number of hills in the distance. Their graceful
    wooded slopes enchanted the eye. And this is the wonder of this journey, for in the
    morning I found that these were</p>
    <p>{254}</p>
    <p>not hills at all, but ruined dagobas, which time had fledged with forestry!</p>
    <p>To me these cities appear incomparably greater as monuments than even those of Egypt.
    They are not so sympathetic spiritually; they lack the appeal of geometry and aesthetics
    which makes the land of Khem my spiritual fatherland. But one has to grant the gargantuan
    grandeur of the old Singalese civilization. Their idea, even of so pedestrian a project as
    a tank, was simply colossal. They though in acres where others think in square yards. One
    of the pagodas has for its lowest terrace --- I think it is about a mile in circumference
    --- a ring of stone elephants little short of life size. Most of the ornamentation has
    perished, but the loss does not really matter. The point of the place is the prodigious
    piety which erected these useless enormities merely as memorials to the Master.</p>
    <p>Frankly, I was fed up with marvels. All subjects bore me alike after a short time; they
    cease to stimulate. I was thoroughly pleased to find myself at last in India. The
    psychological change from Ceylon is very sudden, startling and complete. What is there
    about an island which differentiates it so absolutely from the adjoining mainland? No
    amount of similarity of race, customs and culture gets rid of insularity. The moment one
    sets foot in India, one becomes aware of the stability of its civilization.</p>
    <p>I spent some weeks wandering through the southern provinces. I cannot forbear
    mentioning one charming incident. At some station or other, I was about to take the train.
    A white man with a long white beard came down the whole length of the train in the blazing
    sun to my carriage. He had seen that I was strange to the country and asked if he could be
    of any service. (Unless one knows the ropes, one has to put up with a lot of petty
    discomforts.) The man was Colonel Olcott. It was the first act of kindly thoughtfulness
    that I had ever known a theosophist perform --- and the last. For many years.</p>
    <p>The rock temples of Madura are probably the finest in India, perhaps in the world.
    There seems no limit. Corridor after corridor extends its majestic sculptures, carved
    monoliths, with august austerity. They are the more impressive that the faith which
    created them is as vital today, as when India was at the height of its political power. My
    experiences of Yoga stood me in good stead. I knew, of course, that the average European
    would not be permitted to visit the most interesting parts of the temple, and I thought I
    would see what I could do to take a leaf out of Burton's book. So I disposed of my
    European belongings and took up my position outside a village near by, with a loincloth
    and a begging bowl. The villagers knew, of course, that I was an Englishman, and watched
    me suspiciously for some time from the edge of the jungle. But as soon as they found that
    I was really expert in Yoga, they lost no time in making friends. One man in particular
    spoke English well and was himself a great authority on Yoga. He introduced me to the
    writings of Sabapati Swami, whose instructions are clear and excellent, and his method
    eminently practical. My friend introduced me to the authorities at the bid temple at
    Madura, and I was allowed to enter some of the secret shrines, in one of which I
    sacrificed a goat to Bhavani.</p>
    <p>The fact is that Buddhism had got on my nerves. I preferred the egocentric psychology
    of Hinduism --- naturally enough, since the fundamental consciousness of the average
    European is sympathetic. Our very speech almost compels us to think of the universe in
    this way. Ethically, too, Hinduism appealed to me; it seemed positive; its injunctions
    seemed to lead somewhere. Buddhism repelled me by its abhorrence of action, its insistence
    upon the idea of sorrow as inherent in all things in themselves. Hinduism at least admits
    the existence of joy; the only trouble is that happiness is unstable. In practice, again,
    Buddhism suited Allan, whose only idea of pleasure was relief from the perpetual pain
    which pursued him; whereas I, with the world at my feet, was out to do something definite
    and even to take delight in the buffetings of fortune. I enjoyed this adventure immensely'
    I felt myself all kinds of a fine fellow for penetrating these sinister sanctuaries.</p>
    <p>To a young wizard waltzing round the world, some of the early impressions of the India
    whose philosophy and religion he has learnt to reverence so profoundly are a shade
    disconcerting. I could not help feeling the degradation of the woman who swept out the dak
    bungalow at Madura. She was a grotesque hag at thirty. I had seen nothing of the kind in
    Mexico, or, indeed, anywhere else before or since, till I struck the back-blocks of the
    United States of America. But in her time she had been a woman of great wealth, for I
    could have put my hand and arm clean through the lobe of her ear. She must at one time
    have worn enormously heavy earrings.</p>
    <p>Her attitude gave me a peculiar little shiver. To sweep the floor, which she did with a
    short-handled brush, she bent entirely from the hips, being straight above an below. It
    somehow gave me the impression of a broken stick. And then I was reminded of the queen's
    spaniel in &quot;Zadig.&quot; For in the dust of the floor were two tiny trails made by
    her sagging breasts as they swung idly out of her cotton cloth.</p>
    <p>I had made a point from the beginning of making sure that my life as a Wanderer of the
    Waste should not cut me off from my family, the great men of the past. I got India-paper
    editions of Chaucer, Shakespeare and Browning; and, in default of India paper, the best
    editions of <em>Atalanta in Calydon</em>. <em>Poems and Ballads</em> (First Series),
    Shelley, Keats and <em>The Kabbalah Unveiled</em>. I caused all these to be bound in
    vellum, with ties. William Morris had re-introduced this type of binding in the hope of
    giving a mediaeval flavour to his publications. I adopted it as being the best protection
    for books against the elements. I carried these volumes everywhere, and even when mu
    alleged waterproof rucksack was soaked through, my masterpieces remained intact.</p>
    <p>{256}</p>
    <p>Let this explain why I should have been absorbed in Browning's <em>Christmas Eve</em>
    and <em>Easter Day</em> at Tuticorin. I was criticizing it in the light of my experience
    in Dhyana, and the result was to give me the idea of answering Browning's apology for
    Christianity by what was essentially a parody of his title and his style. My poem was to
    be called &quot;Ascension Day and Pentecost&quot;.</p>
    <p>I wrote &quot;Ascension Day&quot; at Madura on November 16th and 'Pentecost&quot; the
    day after; but my original idea gradually expanded. I elaborated the two poems from time
    to time, added &quot;Berashith</a>&quot;
    --- of which more anon --- and finally &quot;Science and Buddhism&quot;, an essay on these
    subjects inspired by a comparative study of what I had learnt from Allan Bennett and the
    writings of Thomas Henry Huxley. These four elements made up the volume finally published
    under the title <em>The Sword of Song</em>.</p>
    <p>One of the great sights of south India is the great temple of the Shivalingam. I spent
    a good deal of time in its courts meditating on the mystery of phallic worship. Apologists
    ordinarily base their defence on a denial that the lingam is worshipped as such. They
    claim correctly enough that it is merely the symbol of the supreme creative spiritual
    force of the Most High. It is perfectly true, none the less, that barren women
    circumambulate it in the hope of becoming fruitful. I accepted this sublimation gladly,
    because I had not yet been healed of the wound of Amfortas: I had not got rid of the shame
    of sex. My instinct told me that Blake was right in saying &quot;The lust of the goat is
    the glory of god.&quot; But I lacked the courage to admit it. The result of my training
    had been to obsess me with the hideously foul idea that inflicts such misery on Western
    minds and curses life with civil war. Europeans cannot face the facts frankly; they cannot
    escape from their animal appetite, yet suffer the tortures of fear and shame even while
    gratifying it. As Freud has now shown, this devastating complex is not merely responsible
    for most of the social and domestic misery of Europe and America, but exposes the
    individual to neurosis. It is hardly too much to say that our lives are blasted by
    conscience. We resort to suppression and the germs created an abscess.</p>
    <p>The Hindu is of course a slave to his superstitions about sin even more than most
    nominal Christians, for the simple reason that he is absolutely serious about the welfare
    of his soul. I remember coming across a tribe which did not use tobacco. I offered them
    some and they refused. I supposed it was forbidden by their religion, but they told me no.
    It was, however, not commanded by their religion; they could therefore see no object in
    doing it. The Hindu attitude towards sin, absurd as it is, compares favourably with ours;
    because, though afraid of it, they have not reached our own state of panic which makes us
    the prey of the most fantastic superstitions and perversions of truth. I have found it
    practically impossible to convince middle-class</p>
    <p>{257}</p>
    <p>Anlgo-Saxons of facts which anyone would think were bound to be known. They take refuge
    in angry denial. It seems to them that if they once admit the most elementary and obvious
    propositions, they are bound to fall headlong into a bottomless pit of bestiality. Where,
    in fact, they always are.</p>
