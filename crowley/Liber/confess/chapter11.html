    <p>In 1894 I had my first serious taste of the Alps. I went with my tutor to the
    Suldenthal in the Austrian Tyrol. I had discovered the Badminton Volume of Mountaineering.
    I looked on it very much as I had been taught to look on the Bible. It says much for my
    innocence previously described, that despite the data already in my possession, I failed
    entirely to realize that the one book was as full of grotesque blunders and inaccuracies
    as the other. I arrived in Sulden with a deep reverence for the Alpine guide, and hastened
    to engage Joseph Pingerra, who was supposed to be the best in the valley. I was very
    shocked to find that is was customary in the Tyrol to go two on a rope instead of three,
    though in point of fact this was the only thing they knew about climbing. But I was amazed
    beyond measure to find that I was a much better rock climber than my guide. He did not
    know what rock climbing was, judged by Cumberland standards! I had no experience of snow
    and ice; so here, of course, I was the reverent disciple. Imagine my astonishment, then,
    when after two or three days Pingerra slipped and fell on a perfectly easy snow slope. He
    was entirely unable to do anything to save himself and I had to pull him up on the rope. I
    retained my faith in Badminton by saying to myself that the guides in the outlying groups
    must be very poor examples. I engaged two other guides and started for the
    K&quot;nigspitze, spending the night in a hut. In the morning the guides were drunk and
    unwilling to start, making absurd excuses about the weather. I had not sufficient
    self-confidence to tackle the K&quot;nigspitze by myself; but I dismissed them, made a
    solitary ascent of the Eisseespitze, and thought the matter over. I was utterly disgusted
    and decided to learn ice and snowcraft by myself, as I had with rocks.</p>
    <p>A few days later I went out alone and made the first ascent of the Ortler by the
    Hintere Grat. The mountain had previously been climbed on this side; but the ridge had not
    been followed with the conscientiousness which was the rule in England. It took me six and
    a half hours to reach the summit.</p>
    <p>My arrival created a profound sensation. Sitting on the top were an American and a
    guide, who had come up by the easy way from the Payerh&#129;tte. The guide regarded my
    appearance as strictly supernatural; but the American feared not God, neither regarded
    man. He had been trying to persuade the guide to go down to Sulden by the Hintere Grat and
    the guide had cold feet.</p>
    <p>My arrival changed the situation. Once assured that I was flesh and blood, the guide
    plucked up a little courage, which the American further stimulated</p>
    <p>{101}</p>
    <p>by a promise of additional dollars. As I had come up alone, the three of us could
    evidently go down together. I agreed to accept the responsible position of last man and we
    roped up accordingly. But we were no sooner started than the guide again lost whatever
    nerve he ever possessed. His employer had never been on a mountain before, but he had
    common sense and pluck; he behaved admirably in every respect; we half nursed and half
    chivvied that guide down that ridge. It was, of course, out of the question to follow the
    ridge, as I had just done, so that two or three thousand feet of the descent were
    accomplished by glissading down snow slopes. If I had been alone I could have got down by
    that route in under three hours. As it was, we took nine and a half. But the next day the
    guide had no lack of nerve; he wanted me to pay him for his services! Nothing doing.</p>
    <p>I made a number of other ascents in the district, for the most part alone, but once or
    twice with some chance-met English. My chief aim was to master the technique of snow and
    ice; and by dint of using my senses and my sense I found out most of the tricks of the
    trade in the course of the season. I am particularly proud of having invented a pattern of
    Steigeisen, identical with that used by Oscar Eckenstein as far as the idea was concerned.
    The difference was that he, being an engineer, had had them forged in accordance with
    mechanical principles, whereas I had entrusted the execution of mine to a rotten firm with
    a great reputation in Alpine Club circles, whose ignorance of the elements of material and
    workmanship must have caused many &quot;regretable incidents&quot;.</p>
    <p>In 1895 I felt myself fit to tackle the higher peaks of the Alps and went to the Little
    Scheideck. My first exploit was a solitary ascent of the Eiger. I started late and on the
    final ridge caught up with a &quot;strong&quot; party of English with guides, the
    principal Herr being a charming clergyman from Japan, the Rev. Walter Weston. The guides
    were more or less drunk and frightened. They were trying to make some excuse for turning
    back; but shame stimulated their courage when I came up and we proceeded to the summit. We
    all went down together; the guides professed themselves delighted with the sure-footed
    agility of my performance and said that I was <em>wie ein Führer</em>.&quot; A year
    before the compliment would have persuaded me that I had died and gone to heaven, but time
    had changed all that. I still clung pathetically to Badminton; I had merely reached the
    stage of praying pathetically to meet the good guides described in the book. I was still
    obsessed by the idea that it was suicidal to cross snow-covered glaciers without a rope.
    So I took a porter: he was quite willing to obey my orders implicitly, since I was
    regarded as a <em>Wunderkind</em>. We went up the Jungfrau by the Schneehorn-Silberhorn
    route, I leading up and descending last. But it was the same old story. The man couldn't
    stand on a snow slope. I was constantly having to misuse valuable time in saving his
    worthless life.</p>
    <p>{102}</p>
    <p>I began to reason the whole business out from the start. Mountaineering, I saw, was
    primarily a scientific problem. How, then, could the superstitious and ignorant peasants
    of the Alps master it or even attack it? There could be only one answer; they made no
    attempt to do so. Their craft was traditional; one man learnt from another by rule of
    thumb. Confront any guide with any mountain that he did not know by habit, and he was at
    sea. How was it, then, that the mountains had ever been climbed at all? And the answer to
    that was that the general standard of climbing was, given good weather conditions,
    altogether beneath contempt from the standpoint of the pioneers in England and Wales. The
    ordinary way up any Swiss mountain is little more than a scramble. Eckenstein used to say
    that he would take a cow up the Matterhorn provided that he were allowed to tie its legs.
    And once, when an ex-president of the Alpine Club began to reply to this remark by
    mentioning that he had been up the Matterhorn, some tactless person interrupted, &quot;Did
    they tie <em>your</em> legs!&quot;</p>
    <p>Mummery, Collie and Hastings from England, with Eckenstein and one or two minor lights
    on the one hand, and Purtscheller, Blodig and others from Germany on the other, were
    setting up an entirely new standard of Alpine climbing. They were men of education and
    intelligence; they had studied the physical theory of mountain conditions; they had
    practised the various types of technique required to meet these conditions in detail. They
    were doing climbs which had never been dreamt of by any Alpine guide. The first-rate
    amateur was to the professional as a rifleman to a man with a flint axe.</p>
    <p>In '95 I was not yet aware of what was going on. I discovered independently the facts
    of the case. I found that I could go pretty well anywhere without the least danger or
    difficulty, whereas all the people I met were constantly on the brink of disaster. I began
    to think that solitary climbing was the safest form of the game. The one problem was the
    snow-covered glacier. I began to study that question by itself. I soon noticed that when I
    looked down on such a glacier from a ridge, I could see the covered crevasses quite
    plainly. They appeared as lines of shade. Descending to the glacier, I found that I was
    still able to detect the slight differences in illumination. So much for the theory. But
    the question still remained, &quot;I see it, but can I cross it safely?&quot; My
    experience with chalk helped to give me confidence. I was accustomed to estimate the
    breaking-strain of rotten material. Now, given a night's hard frost, it stands to reason
    that a bridge which has not fallen through by its own weight during the previous day would
    support my extra weight in the early morning. I began to test my theory, being, of course,
    careful to arrange my routes, so as to avoid having to cross snow-covered glaciers after
    sunrise. I noticed, however, that a great deal of care was necessary to avoid accidents;
    and this made for slowness. There were also many other occasions on which</p>
    <p>{103}</p>
    <p>a second man would be a safeguard, and some when he might be of active assistance.</p>
    <p>The question of a third man is quite different. He diminishes the mobility of the
    party; the middle man is deprived almost completely of any freedom of action. Whenever the
    ground is so difficult that only one man can move at a time, a party of three takes not
    half as long again but twice as long as a party of two, since the operation of pulling in
    a section of rope is duplicated. The speed of a party means a great deal to its safety. As
    regards nightfall, weather conditions, and avalanches or falling stones, two is evidently
    much safer than three. Another point is that it is at least twice as hard to find two
    competent companions as it is to find one.</p>
    <p>The combination of Mummery, Collie and Hastings could hardly happen again in a century.
    Mummery had a genius for rock climbing and an uncanny instinct for mountain problems in
    general. Collie was brilliant all round and had an absolute scientific knowledge of
    materials and a feeling for topography. Hastings was a tower of physical strength and
    endurance, an ideal second man either as a hoist or an anchor. All three were acomplished
    technicians and had experience of every kind of ground and conditions.</p>
    <p>In the absence of so miraculous a combination, the best thing to be hoped for was one
    other man who would possess all the qualities which one lacked oneself; and it was my
    supreme good fortune in 1898 to find what I sought in Oscar Eckenstein.</p>
    <p>In the meantime I went on climbing in the Bernese Oberland during the summer of 1895.
    Certainly the Lord must have been leading me, for I hardly ever went out on a mountain
    without striking some episode which directed my thoughts into the right channel.</p>
    <p>To return to psychology. It is hard to summarize the general effects of my queer
    education. But it was terribly uneven. In some respects I was a long way ahead of most
    boys of my age; in others I was little better than an imbecile. I was practically
    prevented from acquiring the habit of normal relations with other people. My associates
    were, for the most part, much older than myself.</p>
    <p>But the one really disastrous feature was the attitude which I was compelled to assume
    about money. I was taught to expect every possible luxury. Nothing was too good for me;
    and I had no idea of what anything cost. It was all paid for behind my back. I was never
    taught that effort on my part might be required to obtain anything that I wanted; but one
    the other hand I was kept criminally short of pocket money lest I should spend it in some
    disgraceful way, such as buying books or tobacco, or spending it on even worse
    abominations such as theatres and women. (I was encouraged to keep a dog!) I had therefore
    no sense of responsibility in the matter of money. It</p>
    <p>{104}</p>
    <p>never occurred to me that it was possible to make it, and I was thus trained to be
    dependent to the point of mendicancy. The effect was, of course, disastrous. When I got to
    Cambridge I still had everything paid for me and in addition I found myself with unlimited
    credit which I could keep secret. When I came into my fortune a year later, I was utterly
    unprepared to use it with the most ordinary prudence, and all the inherent vices of my
    training had a perfectly free field for their development. Before, if I wanted to give a
    dinner party every day of the week, I could do it, but if I wanted a little cash my only
    alternative to the card table was the pawnshop, till I came of age. After that, it was
    simply a question of writing a cheque, which gave me no idea of the nature of the
    transaction involved. I doubt whether any one in history was ever furnished with such a
    completely rotten preparation for the management of practical affairs.</p>
    <p>My residence at Eastbourne broke up very suddenly. During the whole of my adolescence I
    had taken the romantic point of view of love; and I found that the universal practice was
    for elder people to interfere in the affairs of their juniors. Two people could not decide
    to marry without rousing a hurricane. There was never any exception. Engagements were
    always being made and broken on unintelligible religious grounds. The family of the
    Lamberts was no exception to this. The eldest daughter was an acid old maid in the late
    twenties; the youngest was a hysterical monster of suppression. The middle girl was
    beautiful, voluptuous and normal. She was not sufficiently intelligent to revolt openly
    against her family; but her human instincts told her that something was wrong and that she
    had better get out of it. She was in love with a quite suitable young man and engaged to
    him on probation. The question was whether he would or wouldn't join the Plymouth
    Brethren. Naturally, the more he saw of them the less he liked them and he ultimately made
    up his mind to stand by the church of his fathers. On announcing this desolating decision
    he was overwhelmed with abuse and thrown out of the house. His fianc&#130;e was forbidden
    to communicate with him in any way, and to all intents and purposes imprisoned. I offered
    to arrange for correspondence with a view to an early elopement. But I couldn't stand the
    continuous abuse and illtreatment which was the portion of the unfortunate girl. The
    family literally foamed at the mouth on every opportunity. Meals were a poisoned
    whirlwind. She was constantly reduced to tears and perhaps the happiest time she had was
    when she was actually being beaten. I ought to have conducted my intrigues with greater
    patience, no doubt, but it got on my nerves too much. One morning at breakfast I said
    about a millionth part of what I thought and the family started screaming. It was as if
    they had been attacked by collective mania. Everything was thrown at me; they went for me
    with claws and fists. They were too blind with rage to know what they were doing. I simply
    knocked their heads</p>
    <p>{105}</p>
    <p>together and walked out of the house. When I thought the atmosphere had had time to
    dissipate I returned with the intention of carrying out a rescue for the distressed
    damsel. They were too much scared to oppose me and I begged her to come away at once and
    go to her ex-fiancé's family. But she could not summon up courage to do it. The
    opportunity went by; and later in the afternoon my Uncle Tom, summoned by telegram, came
    to fetch me away from the accursed spot. </p>
    <p>The incident had a wholesome effect on my own family. They had failed to break my
    spirit and begun to realize that I had reached the stage when I could make as much trouble
    for them as they could for me. The best thing they could do was to let me go my own way. I
    had won the fight; and the evidence of my triumph was my season in the Bernese Oberland on
    my own responsibility. I was recalled by a telegram. They had decided to let me go to
    Trinity; and the entrance examination was only a week away. I went up to Cambridge and
    passed it without difficulty, though I had had no opportunity of preparing the set
    classics. But I followed Browning's advice to &quot;greet the Unseen with a cheer&quot;:
    my real knowledge of Greek and Latin enabled me to give renderings, far above the average,
    of unfamiliar passages. I could never adapt myself to the sheep-system of mnemonic
    &quot;learning&quot;. In October I entered the university, taking rooms at 16 St. John's
    Street. From that moment begins an entirely new chapter in my life.</p>
