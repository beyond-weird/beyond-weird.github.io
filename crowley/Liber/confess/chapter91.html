    <p>Few jewels in my collection of freaks are more precious than Cecil Maitland. From his
    birth, he aroused the liveliest hopes among students of entomology; for his father, a
    distinguished Anglican controversialist, followed Newman and Manning into apostasy. His
    projects for attaining the papacy were, however, thwarted by the unscrupulous action of a
    charming lady, who insisted upon dragging him from the very foot of the altar to a rival
    sacrament pedlar, who promptly conjoined them in wedlock at the regular rates. This
    escapade did not escape the notice of the Vatican. The Pope was surprised into the
    exclamation &quot;Tut&quot;, or its Latin equivalent. He scratched his head and muttered,
    &quot;Martin Luther!&quot; After a moment's reflection he dispatched his chamberlain for
    bell, book and candle; and proceeded to the magical operation against this occasion made
    and provided. As in the case of the Jackdraw of Rheims, the effect of the curse was to
    ruffle the feathers of the audacious follower after the false god Hymen. A touch of
    rheumatism brought matters to a climax. He rang up Harrods and ordered a supply of
    sackcloth and ashes. Receiving, like Job, visits of condolence from various righteous
    friends he besought them to intercede with the Almighty on his behalf; and as they
    numbered not a few influential people, with strings on the College of Cardinals, the Pope
    was eventually persuaded to &quot;silence that dreadful bell&quot;, return the book to its
    shelf and snuff the comminatory candle. The Rev. Mr Maitland was restored to the bosom of
    the Harlot of the Seven Hills; though not to the priesthood; and on the strict condition
    that for the future he should regard his wife as tabu. Things thus satisfactorily settled,
    she brought forth a man child and called his name Cecil James Alexander, rejecting with
    contumacy the suggested alternative Caoutchouc. He grew in stature and in favour of God
    and man, so far as research had hitherto been able to determine. But he was subject to
    amiable delusions, one of which took the sinister shape of <em>Cacoethes Scribendi</em>.
    In the Great War he joined the army and became a real &quot;capting&quot;. Advised of this
    fact, the Germans wisely refrained from entering Edinburgh. His next step was to become a
    dipsomaniac and lose his teeth. During this period he suffered from hydrophobia and did
    not wash for eighteen months. This romantic situation enflamed the virgin heart of a
    large, white, red-haired maggot named Mary Butts, or rather Rodker.</p>
    <p>In the previous spasm she had rushed to the registrar the most nauseating colopter<strong>1</strong>
    that ever came under my microscope. It was a Whitechapel Jew</p>
    <p>{878}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Id est: beetle; insect, louse, crawling thing, vermin.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>who proclaimed himself a poet on the strength of a few ungrammatical and incoherent
    ramblings, strung together and chopped at irregular intervals into lines. He used to hang
    about studios in the hope of cadging cigarettes and drinks. He even got into mine on one
    occasion, owing to a defect in the draught excluder. Luckily the plumbing was perfect. One
    tug on the chain, a gush and a squeal, and I saw him no more. But somehow he squirmed out
    of the sewers and, as I said, obtained the official position, louse pediculosis, with Mary
    Butts. She washed him and dressed him, which naturally led to disenchantment, and Cecil
    reigned in his stead.</p>
    <p>In 1922, they were paying the price of their outrage on morality. They were both in
    very bad health and very hard-pressed for money. One of their favourite amusements was
    playing at Magick. Idle and mentally muddled, they were attracted by all subjects which
    seemed to require no orderly thought or steady work. Nothing is easier than to pick up a
    few awe-inspiring terms and stir them into soup. It is the only way to impress those even
    more ignorant. They therefore came to me. With my invariable optimism, I picked out all
    the promising points and overlooked the faults, I promised myself that I could easily
    correct them. Their wretchedness kindled my pity and I invited them to spend their summer
    in the abbey at Cefalu. I really believed that a month or two of simple life, free from
    temptations and distractions, with the quiet discipline of our regulations, might put them
    on the right road.</p>
    <p>They arrived.</p>
    <p>The very next day I got the shock of my life. I must mention first that, some time
    earlier, Maitland had had some sort of job mining or planting in the East. On his journey
    out, his ship was standing off Colombo pending quarantine inspection. He was sitting on
    the rail talking to a girl. Suddenly he fell backwards and was pulled into a boat by
    Singhalese pedlars who had no consideration for the perfectly justifiable feelings of the
    local sharks, or any philosophical care for the welfare of humanity.</p>
    <p>The told this story to excuse his aversion to water. It was, however, of vital
    important to his health that he should learn to swim. We went down to the Caldara alone,
    took off our clothes and started round the rocks. I showed him how to proceed without the
    slightest need of swimming, by letting the water take most of his weight, and using his
    hands to hang on to the large convenient knobs of rock which abound everywhere. He showed
    the most abject fear, but I supposed that a few minutes would give him confidence. On the
    contrary his terror increased and I had infinite trouble to get him to come even a couple
    of hundred yards. We reached the breaking point. He found a ledge, scrambled ashore and
    shivered. I gave up and swam back. I dressed and smoked. No sign of Captain Webb. I
    climbed to the top of the cliff, where I could see the whole edge. There he was like a cat
    on hot</p>
    <p>{879}</p>
    <p>bricks, with all due apologies to the feline race. He had chosen to try to find an
    overland route, stark naked on sharp rough rocks --- and there really wasn't a way. He
    reached, at last, a cave, which possessed a fairly broad opening above water, so that I
    could throw him his sandals. He had merely to walk home on a broad flat shelf which would
    not have asked him to wade more than waist high. But he insisted on the most excoriating
    and dangerous scramble across slimy crags. An hour or so later, he finally got to his
    clothes. The unfortunate wretch was bleeding all over. We then walked home and he took
    occasion to thank me for the most unpleasant afternoon he had ever spent in his life. Even
    then I took the remark lightly. I could not seriously believe that he had been really in
    torture. It is a fixed idea in my mind that any Englishman of good blood enjoys an
    adventure, the rougher the better. But the spirit was not in him. Of course, I know that
    his father's psychology amply accounts for this abject attitude. In him the exhaustion of
    the stock had reached its climax. I learned later that he had already attempted suicide.
    He had tried to shoot himself in the heart with a revolver. One would imagine that it
    would have been safe to bet on his doing some damage. But no! His pistol was spiritually
    his twin. The bullet thought that it might hurt itself if it happened to hit a bone, so it
    skipped nimbly round his ribs and sought repose from the tribulations of existence in a
    comfortable cushion.</p>
    <p>I soon discovered the root of his rottenness. After all, there must be a star somewhere
    there behind that bank of trembling fob. I worked with a will to save him. And one of the
    most pathetic incidents in my memory is that he came to me one morning with tears on the
    threshold of his eyes, and said in a quivering tenor, &quot;I want to live!&quot;, grasped
    my hand, fell on his knees and broke out sobbing. I felt that I had won the fight. The
    root of his weakness was that the will-to-live was absent.</p>
    <p>From that moment he began to mend. Of course, all sorts of suppressed perversities
    externalized, and had to be analysed and destroyed. But I had great hopes of him when he
    left the abbey. Alas! it is easy to cure evil whose source is error; enlightenment
    restores righteousness. The misdirected energy returns to its proper course. But weakness
    is usually incurable; even the most hopeful cases require the discipline of years to
    establish habits whose inertia will protect the will from interference.</p>
    <p>In the case of Maitland, the moment he showed the wish to become independent, the
    vanity of Mary Butts was wounded and her jealousy inflamed. She might have won the love of
    a first-rate man, but she preferred to dull the anguish of the consciousness that she was
    a weakling, as she admitted, by keeping in abject dependence upon her a man on whom she
    could look down. She accordingly did all she could to push him back into the mire of
    misery and self-contempt; and of course, no sooner was my</p>
    <p>{880}</p>
    <p>influence removed, than he sipped back into the stinking slime from which I had tried
    to rescue him.</p>
    <p>Less than a year later, I heard that he swallowed a bottle of poison --- not even a
    decent poison, such as a self-respecting suicide might be expected to use. I forget the
    precise ingredients. I think it was some sort of disinfectant, such as is sold without
    restriction because legislatures had failed to imagine anyone asinine or abject enough to
    make it a beverage. The luck still held. I don't know whether it disinfected him, but it
    certainly made him as sick as a sewer. He pulled through and I am only sorry not to be
    able to say, in the present edition, what happened next.</p>
    <p>I cannot be serious and yet I am honestly sad beyond expression whenever the man comes
    up in my mind. His character was charming as few other men I ever met. His talent for
    writing, though limited by his moral weakness to trivialities, possessed many admirable
    qualities. His expression was simple and effective, and his fascination undeniable. It is
    hard to have to think of him as fit only for the garbage man. And yet if indeed it were
    possible to build him up sufficiently to make him of positive value, one would have to ask
    oneself whether the most optimistic estimate of success would not have to be weighed
    against the cost in patience and perseverance and found wanting.</p>
    <p>The great value of such men as Maitland and Neuburg to me has been to strengthen my
    conviction that in the absence of will power, the most complete collection of virtues and
    talents is wholly worthless. Combine in one man the strength of Hercules, the beauty of
    Apollo, the grace of Antinos, the wisdom of Athena, the intelligence of Hermes, and every
    other gift of every other god, unless the anatomist is careful to supply a spine to
    support the structure, you will have a mollusc and not a man. You must have a fulcrum, not
    only to move the world, but to move a feather.</p>
    <p>Besides our regular members we had a short visit from the two sisters of Cypris, Mimi
    --- her twin --- and Helen, nearly twenty years her senior.</p>
    <p>Mimi was delighted. She yearned intensely to throw in her lot with us for life and yet
    she was inhibited by subconscious fear. The chains from civilization clanked on her ankles
    and wrists. She stayed with us for a fortnight and then went back to her work with the Red
    Cross in the devastated districts round Soissons. But the gods had their rod in the pickle
    for her.</p>
    <p>I must explain that members of the abbey bore certain distinguishing marks. The
    official costume for those not entitled to the special robes of the A.'. A.'. was a
    vestment of bright blue hanging from neck to ankle with sleeves widening from shoulder to
    waist so that on extending the arms horizontally from the body it suggested the letter
    Tau. It was lined with scarlet and provided with a hood. When desired the dress was
    completed by a golden girdle. In addition the male members shaved the head with the
    exception of a single lock in the center of the forehead. The women wore</p>
    <p>{881}</p>
    <p>bobbed hair dyed red or yellow with henna. In these customs were symbolized certain
    spiritual or magical affirmations. The aureole of the women was in honour of our father
    the sun, and the upstanding lock of hair worn by the men a token of worship to his
    viceregent in the microcosm.</p>
    <p>One afternoon the women were retouching their hair with henna, and Mimi took it into
    her head to tint her own tresses slightly with the same paste. The change was barely
    perceptible to any sane eye, but the moment she showed up at Soissons the horrible hags in
    authority pounced on the child, overwhelmed her with outrageous insults and cast her forth
    from their chaste company. It was an abominable abuse of power, no less than a foul-minded
    frenzy and a sadistic injustice. I wrote congratulating her on having achieved such a
    drastic demonstration of the truth of what we had told her about such people, and reminded
    her that she would always be welcome in the abbey.</p>
    <p>But now a strange obsession assailed her. During her visit I had been even more
    absorbed in my work than usual and had hardly exchanged a dozen words with her. I had not
    urged her to undertake the Great Work. On the contrary I had been specially careful to
    maintain an attitude of simple friendliness. Yet she found herself the prey of a mingled
    fear and fascination. I was constantly present in her mind. She desired passionately to
    live in the shadow of my personality, yet at the same time was filled with panic fear of
    what seemed to her a surrender of her soul. The obsession grew to insane intensity. She
    felt that she was not safe in France. She must escape to the ends of the earth. She would
    hide herself in America. The poor child never guessed that she was trying to elude
    herself. However, she was carried away by her fears and fled to the States, where she paid
    the penalty of her panic. Fate has smitten again and again, and I hope that suffering will
    teach her what intelligence failed to impart. I shall be very surprised if sooner or
    later, she does not find her true will. For her only foes are ignorance and fear. Her
    heart is whole and honest.</p>
    <p>With Helen the case was very different. I had met her in Paris early in '21, taken her
    to lunch at Lavenue's several times, and introduced her to some of my friends. I saw in
    the first few minutes that her life was one long pang. She had nothing to look back upon
    with pleasure or any hope for the future. Her face told the tale. The skin was dry,
    wrinkled and jaundiced; the thin lips were compressed with constant bitterness. Her
    intelligence was sufficient to tell her what was wrong. She had never known freedom. She
    had been robbed of her soul so that her masters might have a machine they could trust not
    to play any trick. The steam roller of social injustice had flattened her. Every drop of
    her blood had been drained by sterile servitude to soulless wealth. Yet she would not
    accept the way of escape that we offered so freely. Her suffering was intensified by the
    sight of the carefree happiness which</p>
    <p>{882}</p>
    <p>she found in the abbey. At the time of her visit, we happened to be particularly short
    of funds, and it enraged her to see that poverty was powerless to destroy our happiness or
    drag love from his throne in our hearts. Why couldn't we quarrel and scold like the people
    she was accustomed to? Envy gnawed at her liver and black bile oozed from the wounds. She
    began to hate us with insane intensity and the fiend fattened on the fact that her malice
    was impotent to make us unkind to her.</p>
    <p>However, she succeeded at least in making herself impossible. She started a campaign of
    venomous falsehoods, which she knew to be such. The Ape and I had planned to go to England
    before she arrived, but by a series of accidents we were obliged to postpone the journey.
    However, in view of our plans we had given up the second house, so that when she began to
    try to corrupt the children I was obliged to interfere. I gave her the choice between
    retracting some of the more malignant lies, in which I had caught her out, or pursuing her
    career of crime in some more favourable environment within fifteen minutes. She had no
    defence. The witnesses were unanimous. Her denials and evasions were nailed to the counter
    with a single smack the instant they were out of her mouth. So out she went, and we gave a
    great gasp of relief. Yet still I felt sorry. Even such cold malignity as hers only
    confirmed me in compassion. In other circumstances she might have developed into a human
    being. My action surprised her completely. I had seemed so easy going and unobservant, so
    uniformly considerate and kind. When that lazy big lion suddenly leapt from his lair, she
    suffered the shock of her life. &quot;I thought there might be something of the
    sort,&quot; she said, startled out of prudence, &quot;but I didn't think it would come for
    a long while.&quot; She had hoped to do irreparable damage before being found out, and now
    she learnt, as so many before her and since, that the big lion sleeps with one eye open.
    Baffled and broken, her only idea was revenge. She did an amazing thing. She went to some
    consul in Palermo and swore to a long list of lies. She thought she could make trouble for
    us, though even after racking her brains for slanders she could only think of one thing
    which might bring us into conflict with the law. It was an act of unspeakable vileness.
    Success could only mean that her sister would be utterly ruined, torn from her home and
    her children, and either put in prison or thrown upon the world penniless in a foreign
    country without resources of any kind. Having shot the poisoned arrow, she pursued the
    Parthian policy of putting as many thousand miles as possible between herself and her
    victims. Before we found out what she had done she must be safe from pursuit. It was no
    part of her scheme to have to confront us and be cross-examined.</p>
    <p>Of course the whole thing fizzled out. On the one alleged breach of the law, we were
    raided by the Cefalu police, of course without warning. They did their duty, while, of
    course, well aware that they had been sent to look for a</p>
    <p>{883}</p>
    <p>mare's nest. They behaved with charming courtesy and withdrew with many apologies for
    their action. We have heard from time to time of Helen. She is back on the treadmill,
    lonely and loveless, wearily and miserably dragging her despair through life --- to call
    it life --- down to death. Should these words come under her notice, let me assure her
    that we bear no ill-will, that she will always be welcome when she learns her lesson: that
    love is the only principle which makes life tolerable.</p>
    <p>I gladly leave this wretched episode. The Ape and I left Cefalu for Paris early in
    February and took up, as usual, our abode with our friends Monsieur and Madame Bourcier,
    50 rue Vavin, a few doors below the Boulevard Montparnasse near the Rotonde. I cannot let
    pass this occasion of expressing my affection and gratitude which these good folks have
    won. Their hotel has been my headquarters in Paris for over fifteen years and from the
    very beginning they treated me more like a son than a stranger. When people talk against
    the French and complain of the difficulty of getting on with them, I smile only a little
    at their stupidity, and all the rest at the memory of the kindness which I have received
    from the Bourciers. </p>
    <p>Nor is the case unique. I confess that now and again, I have met French people without
    real politeness or real good feeling. I will add that the wealthy and alleged aristocratic
    classes are sprinkled much too thinly with individuals for whom I have any use. I find
    them selfish and boring. The first is the cause of the second, for the secret is that they
    lack faith in life; seeking self they have found an inane nullity, and being bored with
    themselves they naturally bore other people. But French artists, the professional classes
    and the much abused bourgeois are almost always delightful. What's more, you can trust
    them to do you a good turn when opportunity occurs. As to the peasant in the provinces, I
    find <em>La Terre</em> very one-sided. No doubt thrift often becomes avarice and meanness,
    and contact with the soil a hardening and dehumanizing influence. But if you know how to
    take them the right way, you will find them a pretty good sort.</p>
    <p>I have a theory that English people find the French unsympathetic for one fundamental
    reason. Our neighbours and allies, from the President to the most primitive toiler,
    possess one quality which I have analysed at length elsewhere. They insist on refusing to
    fool themselves. They see no sense in pretending things are pretty when they are not. They
    think it stupid to dope themselves and an insult to the intelligence of others to kiss the
    blarney stone. The English mind is accordingly shocked. It is so fixed in the point of
    politeness to refuse reality.</p>
    <p>For the first time in my life, Paris disappointed me. All the old enchantments had
    somehow vanished. I felt that my work lay elsewhere. London called to me. It was quite
    unreasonable. I had no motive for going. I had no means to go. Uneasy and undecided I got
    through the days as best I could.</p>
    <p>{884}</p>
    <p>I decided to seek a solitude favourable for concentration at Hardelot, near Boulogne,
    in a delightful old inn where I had stayed before. The Ape of Thoth was in London. I wired
    her to meet me at Boulogne. So far there was no hitch in the proceedings. She met me at
    the train.</p>
