    <p>Till the Great Gate of Trinity opened me the way to freedom I had always been obsessed
    more or less either by physical weakness or the incubus of adolescence. I had never known
    what it was to be able to work freely and gladly. Now, however, I was able to give myself
    with absolute concentration to literature and I read everything important in the language
    with the utmost thoroughness. For example, I read the whole of the writings of people like
    Carlyle, Swift, Coleridge, Fielding, Gibbon, and so on. In this way I obtained a much more
    comprehensive idea of these men than if I had, as people usually do, picked out the
    masterpieces.</p>
    <p>I was very anxious that my style should not be influenced by my contemporaries, and
    also not to waste myself on anybody who had not stood the test of time. I made it a rule
    to read no one who had not been dead for fifty years, unless brought under my notice in
    some special way. For example, I could not avoid Swinburne, as one of my friends was crazy
    about him and I could not doubt, after the first acquaintance, that that he was a classic.
    Similarly, I allowed myself to read Sir Richard Burton, because <em>The Arabian Nights</em>
    was an established masterpiece and his was the best translation. I also read a good deal
    of French literature and all the best Greek and Latin authors. But my peculiar temperament
    made me balk at one or two fences. I had certain innate ideas about literature; I say
    innate because I cannot imagine on what grounds I formed them. Thus I could not tolerate
    the idea of a novel exceeding a certain length, with the result that I have never read a
    page of Samuel Richardson. It is easier to understand the objection which I had to what I
    thought gossip. I have never read Boswell and have never been able to bring myself to face
    the average memoir. With regard to history<strong>1</strong> again, I demanded that the
    subject should be important. I did not see why I should bother my head about the Crimean
    War. I studied philosophy and kindred subjects with the greatest enthusiasm; but resented
    the form in which it was set forth by such people as Plato. It seemed to me that the
    argument of any of Plato's dialogues might have been presented much more clearly and
    cogently in about a tenth of the space. I made a very thorough study of logic as being my
    critical apparatus.</p>
    <p>It is hard to say what motive impelled me to work so desperately hard as I did. Much of
    the work was anything but pleasant; and at the time, no</p>
    <p>{114}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">There is no such thing as history. The facts, even were they available,
        are too numerous to grasp. A selection must be made; and this can only be one-sided,
        because the selector is enclosed in the same network of time and space as his subject.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>less than now, it appeared quite useless. But I had a strong sense of duty about it. I
    think the idea was mostly to make sure that I knew everything that there was to be known,
    and incidentally to avoid the possibility of plagiarism. There was a certain tinge of
    vanity in the matter as well. I thought it shameful to leave anything unread. I was
    influenced by Ruskin's imbecile remark that any book worth reading was worth buying, and
    in consequence acquired books literally by the ton.</p>
    <p>My plan of going from each author to those whom he quoted had a great advantage. It
    established a rational consecution in my research; and as soon as I reached a certain
    point the curves became re-entrant, so that my knowledge acquired a comprehensiveness
    which could never have been so satisfactorily attained by any arbitrary curriculum. I
    began to understand the real relation of one subject to another. I think I must have
    unconsciously asked myself which subject treated of reality in the most intimate and
    ultimate sense. I was, of course, far from the conception that all truth is equally
    important, or that no truth can by itself cover the whole ground of existence. My tendency
    was to discard certain types of research as immaterial. I gradually got the idea that the
    thing I was looking for was abstruse; and one of the results of this was to induce me to
    read the literature of alchemy. It is perhaps natural for a young man to confuse obscurity
    with profundity.</p>
    <p>With regard to the choice of a profession, I decided on the Diplomatic Service. It
    seemed to me to afford the greatest opportunities for worldly enjoyment, while at the same
    time demanding the highest qualities of mind. The subtlety of intrigue has always
    fascinated me. It is very curious that this should have been the case, in view of my
    master passion for truth and my relentless determination to tell it without regard for
    consequences. The obstacle to my success in the preliminary canter was that I had no
    aptitude whatever for learning languages. I could master the grammar of a language in a
    few hours; but I was impatient of acquiring the vocabulary. Genders and inflections
    irritated my sense of simplicity. It is also difficult for me to acquire a language by
    ear, partly because my hearing is not particularly acute, and partly because I resent any
    conversation whatever which does not deal with matters of prime importance. The early
    stages of learning a language are, therefore, agonizing.</p>
    <p>I had been advised with regard to the fourth language required for the examination not
    to take Italian, because so many people spoke it so perfectly, or Spanish, because it was
    considered the easiest way into the service, but Russian, on account of its extreme
    difficulty, and because the knowledge of it made one eligible for appointment to the most
    interesting and brilliant court in Europe. This led to my going to St. Petersburg, a
    journey which worked wonders in enlarging my outlook on the world.</p>
    <p>{115}</p>
    <p>The passion for travel was already very strong in me. Home was my idea of hell; and
    London itself had a sordid aspect which never appealed to me. The idea of wickedness in
    London is connected with that of shame, and besides this there are certainly excellent
    reasons for a poet to feel unhappy there. To begin with, I can't stand the climate. I have
    known rare days in May and June when youth pays a fleeting visit to town, when the
    sunlight excites and the breeze braces one. It is this idea of the Young Dionysus with
    which I am in love. I always feel myself as about eighteen or twenty; I always look at the
    world through those eyes. It is my constant sorrow that things do not always accommodate
    themselves to that point of view; and it is my eternal mission to redeem the universe to
    that state of intoxicated innocence and spiritual sensuality.</p>

    <p>The air of London is damp and depressing. It suggests the consciousness of sin. Whether
    one has a suite in the Savoy or in an attic in Hoxton, the same spiritual atmosphere
    weighs upon the soul.</p>
    <p>To a poet, moreover, the artistic side of London is the abomination of desolation. The
    plays are commercialized either for sentimentality or pornography. There is something
    uncomfortable in going to see a play by Shakespeare or Ibsen. Actors and spectators alike
    seem to be engaged in a dreary ritual. Grand opera is even worse. Covent Garden patronizes
    Wagner; he is an excuse for the display of diamonds. I shall never forget my first
    experience of Continental opera: <em>Lohengrin</em> at Stockholm. The atmosphere was
    absolutely natural; people had gone there because they really liked the music. I was
    transported into my own ideal world of love and melody. The caresses of my companion were
    the overflowing of ecstatic passion. Sin had been abolished, I was back in Eden.</p>
    <p>In London one cannot even go to the National Gallery or the British Museum with a pure
    heart as one goes to the Louvre or the Prado. One cannot get away from the sense that one
    is performing an act of piety. Concerts are even more dreadful than the opera. The
    surroundings are invariably bleak; one feels that the artist is doing it on purpose.
    Singing and playing demand background. Singing is the natural expression of human emotion,
    the joy of youth and life as connected with the landscapes of Corot and Gauguin, or with
    the interiors of Teniers. Elaborate instrumental music asks for appropriate architecture,
    not necessarily that of the cathedral. Music should have its own temples. London concert
    halls are blasphemous and obscene.</p>
    <p>{116}</p>
    <p>Before the cinema --- the panorama. The camera obscura and the magic lantern were the
    popular scientific wonders of the period. Some nameless <em>pompier</em> had sluiced I do
    not know how many acres of canvas with a representation of Niagara. They built a pavilion
    to house it. One was supposed to be standing on Goat Island --- in fact, one was rather
    the goat --- and one walked round a vast gallery and inspected each segment of the
    waterfall in turn. In due course everyone had see it and the question was what to do with
    the building. They turned it into a <em>palais de glace</em> with real ice. I, always keen
    on skating, bought a ticket for the season. The convention was for the ordinary skater to
    swing round and round the outside, while the experts performed their evolutions in the
    centre. At that time I was bent on learning the outside forward loop, which involves
    raising the unemployed leg very high until you discover the knack. Absorbed in this labour
    I failed to observe the Duke of Orleans, a glaring girl on either arm. He swerved,
    swanking, out of the ruck and collided with me. We both sat down very hard, but I on the
    point of his skate to the detriment of my much prized perineum. Being then a perfect young
    fool, as I am now a perfect old one, I supposed it incumbent on my race and caste to
    pretend not to be hurt, so I forced myself to go on skating despite agony so great that I
    could hardly bite back the tears, until I thought I had done enough for honour and felt
    free to slip away. I was engaged that night to a committee meeting of the Climbing Club at
    the rooms of H. V. Reade in Jermyn Street. I managed somehow to sit through the meeting,
    the matter being made worse by my insane bashfulness which prevented me asking my host to
    let me use his bedroom. We proceeded to a restaurant to dinner, but there I broke down and
    excused myself.</p>
    <p>The rest of the evening's entertainment remains a mystery. I have a vague memory of
    being stretched on the seat of a railway carriage and I learned later that I had reached
    home, some six miles from London, soaked to the skin. I suppose I must have wandered about
    in the rain for an indefinite period, in pain too great to know what I was doing except to
    try to be brave. The blow had set up cystitis which kept me in bed for the next three
    weeks. The inflammation gradually disappeared after spreading to the prostate gland and
    the urethra. Nor was that the end of the trouble. The urethritis caused a discharge which
    proved very refractory to treatment and ultimately determined a triple stricture for which
    I am being treated at the moment of dictating this paragraph more than a quarter of a
    century after the accident. The moral is, of course, to avoid the Bourbons, though, as the
    duke is reported to be dying at the present moment, it is quite possible that his
    physician is shaking his head wisely and saying, &quot;Ah, Your Highness, this is what
    comes from getting mixed up with people like Aleister Crowley! ...&quot;</p>
    <p>{117}</p>
    <p>The very streets testify against the city. On the one hand we have pale stunted
    hurrying pygmies jostling each other in the bitter search for bread; an ant heap is a
    miracle of beauty and dignity in comparison. On the other, when it comes to excitement or
    amusement, we see perspiring brutes belching the fumes of beer; course, ugly parodies of
    apes. Nature affords no parallel to their degradation. There is no open air life, physical
    or mental, and there is the ever-abiding sense of sin and shame to obsess these slaves.
    Nowhere, except in English cities, do these conditions exist. Slum life there is
    elsewhere, and misery enough; pitiful struggle, monstrous greed and triumphant brutality.
    But only in England are the people poisoned through and through; elsewhere there is a
    sense of independence even in the most servile. The Russian mujik is in his way an
    aristocrat.</p>
    <p>And the cause of all these phenomena is one and the same. It is the Anglo-Saxon
    conception of Christianity which pollutes the race. Only the wellfed pagen, whether he be
    a bishop or a bookmaker, is exempt, because he either does not take religion seriously or
    takes it individually without reference to his neighbour. The most bigoted members of the
    Greek and Roman communions of the Continent, though they may feel their religion
    passionately and make it the mainspring of their lives, are not bound together by that
    insect-like collective consciousness which stamps the Anglo-Saxon. The English pagan is in
    nine cases out of ten a Norman or a Celt. He has the aristocratic consciousness, whatever
    he may tell you about his religious opinions. Now it is all very well to be one of the
    master class and smile contemptuously while bowing the knee in the temple of Rimmon, but a
    poet cannot be content with the situation. Hence the most intensely aristocratic types,
    like Shelley and Byron, instead of acquiescing in the social system which made them
    superiors, felt with acute agony the degradation of the slaves among whom they moved, and
    became revolutionaries and exiles because they could not endure to live in such a degraded
    community.</p>
    <p>Certain classes in England possess manliness and self-respect. As a rule they are
    connected with sport and agriculture, or are skilled workmen. The essence of aristocracy
    is to take a pride in being what you are, whatever that may be. There is no room for this
    in industrialism and the result is that one can watch a London thoroughfare for hours
    without even seeing an individual whose nonentity is not repulsive. Everyone who possesses
    natural advantages has got out of the ruck and takes very good care to avoid further
    contamination. Such people lead lives of artificial seclusion. It is part of their
    Freudian protection to become unconscious of the mob. But it is the business of the poet
    to see, hear and know everything. He dare not let himself forget. England is the most
    fertile mother of poets, but she kills the weak and drives the strong to happier land.
    James Thomson, John Davidson, Richard Middleton, Ernst Dowson and I don't know how many</p>
    <p>{118}</p>
    <p>more even in our own generation found England unendurable for this one reason. The
    English poet must either make a successful exile or die of a broken heart.</p>
    <p>At Cambridge I was surrounded by a more or less happy, healthy, prosperous set of
    parasites. The paganism of the university had to a great extent redeemed them from the
    sense of sin. But during vacation I either hid myself in the mountains among the sturdy
    peasants or went abroad. North-western Europe appealed to me. There was a certain element
    of romance in the long nights, the cold clear air, the ice. I loved to wander solitary in
    Holland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. There was a mystery in the streets and a spontaneous
    gaiety in the places of amusement, which satisfied my soul. Life seemed both more remote
    and more intense. As a stranger, I never came into contact with the malaise, the
    soul-searching, the psychological dissatisfaction which Ibsen and Strindberg describe. But
    though my view was thus entirely superficial, it was none the less in a certain sense
    profound and accurate. One can get a very good idea of a country by traveling through it
    in the train. The outward and visible signs do, after all, reveal, especially to the poet,
    its inward and spiritual graces. The people who lead one astray are the analysts who fail
    to come out the other side. Mr. Jorrocks and Mr. Pickwick give a better idea of England
    than Charles Reade or Sir Walter Besant. Dumas père tells us more about France than Zola.
    A great deal of the interior workings of a national mind ought to be taken for granted.
    One can distinguish profitably between two pretty girls at the end of an opera glass. It
    is absolutely misleading to disembowel them, and the average so-called psychological
    writer tries to do. There are all sorts of obscure processes always at work in nature and
    they are more or less the same for all of us. To insist upon them is one of the worst
    kinds of false thinking. Zola's peasants in <em>La Tere</em> are untrue, except as among
    themselves. The ultimate issue is that these people breed cattle, grow corn and wine, and
    fight like demons for their country. Henri Barbusse's <em>Le Feu</em> was a disgrace to
    literature. Mass psychology is the only important thing about the masses. The great
    artists, such as Emily Brontë --- or was it her brother? --- make no such blunder. They
    deal with individuals; but they never lose sight of the fact that the individual is only
    such to a limited extent. He is only one figure in a picture; and when he stands out
    unnecessarily, there is something wrong with the picture. Captain Marryat's stories
    contain masterpieces of individual portraiture, but he never loses sight of the
    background. I am convinced that the English people were very much happier under the old
    semi-feudal system. &quot;Hard cases make bad law.&quot; We have abolished all kinds of
    injustice on our attention being called to them; but the result has been that we have
    created an artificial doctrinaire society in which nobody is really happy or prosperous.
    All classes are complaining. We are in the</p>
    <p>{119}</p>
    <p>condition of a man whose nerves all talk at once instead of doing their work quietly.
    The most appalling of political mistakes is to develop consciousness in sections of the
    social organism which are not its brains. The crash has come in Russia; and we shall not
    have long to wait.</p>
    <p>But in those days of adolescence I had no inducement to do any political thinking. The
    atmosphere was one of prosperity and stability. It was taken for granted that England was
    the greatest country in the world and that nothing could go wrong. One hear about Ireland
    as a perennial nuisance; and Mr. Gladstone was regarded as a traitor, neither more not
    less. One of my tutors had been a Caius don named d'Arcy, whose father was the rector of
    Nymphsfield in Glouchestershire. I had spent some time there --- to make my first
    appearance in the hunting field. &quot;Chapel folk&quot; were looked upon as criminals of
    no class. I remember the old rector clucking over a riddle. &quot;Why is Gladstone's hair
    like a tuft of grass?&quot; &quot;Because it grows on the top of an old sod.&quot; That
    was the quality of political thought which was considered on the same level of certainty
    as two and two make four. I recall two lines of a poem that I wrote to Lord Rosebery:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>And now, my lord, <em>in medias res</em>,<br>
          Get rid of all your red Rad fleas.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I had been invited to meet Gladstone in north Wales, refused to go and wrote him a
    poem.</p>

    <p>My life at Cambridge did nothing to make me think more deeply. With regard to foreign
    politics, the position was parallel. It was pure Kipling; but (in another watertight
    compartment) I was passionately enamored of the views of Shelley, though I did not
    correlate them with any practical programme.</p>
    <p>There was yet another compartment. Scott, Burns and my cousin Gregor had made me a
    romantic Jacobite. I regarded the Houses of Hanover and Coburg as German usurpers; and I
    wished to place &quot;Mary III and IV&quot; on the throne. I was a bigoted legitimist. I
    actually joined a conspiracy on behalf of Don Carlos, obtained a commission to work a
    machine gun, took pains to make myself a first-class rifle shot and studied drill, tactics
    and strategy. However, when the time came for the invasion of Spain, Don Carlos got cold
    feet. The conspiracy was disclosed; and Lord Ashburnham's yacht, which was running the
    arms, fell into the hands of the Spanish navy.</p>
    <p>This part of my mind did succeed in getting disturbed by the other parts. My
    reactionary conservatism came into conflict with my antiCatholicism. A reconciliation was
    effected by means of what they called the Celtic Church. Here was a romantic and mystical
    idea which suited my political and religious notions down to the ground. It lived and
    moved in an atmosphere of fairies, seal-women and magical operations. Sacramentalism was
    kept in the foreground and sin was regarded without abhorrence. Chivalry and mystery were
    its pillars. It was free from priestcraft and tyranny, for the simple reason that it did
    not really exist!</p>
    <p>My innate transcendentalism leapt out towards it. The <em>Morte d'Arthur</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em>
    and <em>Parsifal</em> were my world. I not only wanted to go out on the quest of the Holy
    Grail, I intended to do it. I got the idea of chastity as a positive virtue. It was
    delightful to be pure. Previously, chastity had been my chief abomination; the sign-manual
    of cowardice, heartlessness and slavery. In the Celtic Church there was no fear of God,
    but a communion with Him as nobly familiar as the relations of Roland and Charlemagne. I
    still too everything very literally. Browning's quotation:</p>
    <p align="center">Childe Roland to the dark tower came</p>
    <p>{121}</p>
    <p>was as real to me as the Battle of Waterloo. In a sense, perhaps, even more so. I think
    it was only due to my subconscious common sense that I did not go and see Browning and ask
    him where to find the dark tower!</p>
