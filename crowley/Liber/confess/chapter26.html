    <p>I broke the journey at El Paso. Coming straight from the quiet civilization of Mexico
    it was a terrible shock to find myself in touch with the coarse and brutal barbarism of
    Texas. There are many unpleasant sides of life which cannot be avoided without shirking
    reality altogether; but in the United States they were naked and horrible. The lust of
    money raged stark without the softening influences of courtesy. Drunkenness was stripped
    of good fellowship; the sisterhood of sin presented no deceptive attractions. The most
    idealistic innocent could not have been under a moment's illusion --- they were stalled
    like cattle in rows of wooden shanties; and they carried on their business with fierce
    commercial candour. All those little grace of life which make bought kisses tolerable to
    those sensitive people who are willing to be fooled, were absent.</p>
    <p>I strolled across to Juarez to kiss my girl goodbye. O Mexico, my heart still throbs
    and burns whenever memory brings you to my mind! For many other countries I have more
    admiration and respect, but none of them rivals your fascination. Your climate, your
    customs, your people, your strange landscapes of dreamlike enchantment rekindle my
    boyhood.</p>
    <p>Outside Juarez was a labour camp. Public works of some sort were in progress --- at
    least such progress as we find in Mexico! Hundreds of men were loafing about at their
    eternal cigarettes and tossing various liquefactions of heel-fire down their
    chilli-armoured gullets. Most of the groups were squatting round a soiled poncho, on which
    were scattered coins and greasy cards. I stood and watched one party of three. The
    swearing, jabbering and quarrelling were incessant here, as all over the camp. Nothing
    struck me as abnormal. Then, like a flash of forked lightning, one of the men flung
    himself across the poncho and twisted his fingers in the hair of the man opposite.
    (Astounding recklessness to let it grow so long!) He thrust his thumbs into the corners of
    his enemy's eyes, as he writhed and kicked on top of him, the momentum of his spring
    having bowled the other on to his back. The man's eyes were torn from their sockets in a
    second and his assailant, disengaging himself by a violent jerk from his victim's clutch,
    made off like an arrow across country to the frontier. The shrieks of the mutilated man
    were answered by universal uproar. Some followed on foot, others ran to their bronchos,
    but the great majority maintained an attitude of philosophical indifference. It was no
    business of theirs, except so far as it might remind them to visit the barber.</p>
    <p>{222}</p>
    <p>I went on to San Francisco. The city is famous in history for the earthquake of 1906;
    and for having starved Stevenson, who has described it admirably in <em>The Wrecker</em>.</p>
    <p>It was a glorified El Paso, a madhouse of frenzied money-making and frenzied
    pleasure-seeking, with none of the corners chipped off. It is beautifully situated and the
    air reminds one curiously of Edinburgh. At that time it possessed a real interest and
    glory --- its Chinatown. During the week I was there, I spent most of my time in that
    quarter. It was the first time that I had come into contact with the Chinese spirit in
    bulk; and, though thee exiles were naturally the least attractive specimens of the race, I
    realized instantly their spiritual superiority to the Anglo-Saxon, and my own deep-seated
    affinity to their point of view. The Chinaman is not obsessed by the delusion that the
    profits and pleasures of life are really valuable. He gets all the more out of them
    because he knows their worthlessness, and is consequently immune from the disappointment
    which inevitably embitters those who seek to lay up treasure on earth. A man must really
    be a very dull brute if, attaining all his ambitions, he finds satisfaction. The Eastern
    from Lao Tzu and the Buddha to Zoroaster and Ecclesiastes, feels in his very bones the
    futility of earthly existence. It is the first postulate of his philosophy.</p>
    <p>California got on my nerves. Life in all its forms grew rank and gross, without a touch
    of subtlety. I embodied this feeling in a sonnet:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>. . . gross and great<br>
          Her varied fruits and flowers alike create<br>
          Glories most unimaginable . . .<br>
          . . . yet this is sore,<br>
          A stain; not one of these is delicate.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For some time, I had been contemplating a lyric poem in which everything in the world
    should be celebrated in detail. It was a crazy notion --- one of those fantastic follies
    which is impossible in nature --- a species of literary &quot;squaring the circle&quot;. I
    doubt whether it was a genuine impulse. Its motive was the vanity and vulgarity of
    attempting something big. It was the American passion for tall buildings and record
    processions in another form. It was the probably my reaction to the spiritual atmosphere
    of California. In any case, the worst happened. I began it! The best plan will be to
    describe what happened and get it over.</p>
    <p>It was not finished till the middle of 1904. Book I is in form a gigantic Greek ode. It
    celebrates all the forces of nature and the children of time. Orpheus invokes them in
    turn; and they reply. Book II describes the winning of Eurydice by Orpheus. It is entirely
    a monologue by him. My literary insanity is well indicated by my proposal to insert a
    five-act play, <em>The Argonauts</em>, afterwards published separately, as an incident in
    his wooing!</p>
    <p>{223}</p>
    <p>Book III describes the visit of Orpheus to Hades; and contains the invocations of the
    necessary deities, with their replies. Book IV relates the death of Orpheus. Unwieldy as
    the poem is, it contains some of my best lyrics. Further, even conceding that the entire
    effort was a fiasco, it must be admitted that the task of writing it was an excellent
    discipline; it taught me a great deal about technique and its very awkwardness warned me
    what to avoid.</p>
    <p>On May 1st I find in my diary the following words: &quot;I solemnly began anew the
    operations of the Great Work.&quot; I had mapped out for myself a definite programme which
    was to combine what I had learnt from Eckenstein with the methods of the Order. For
    instance: I had extracted the Magical Formula of the Ritual of Neophyte and applied it to
    a Ceremony of Self-Initiation. I now simplified this and got rid of the necessity of the
    physical temple by expressing it in a series of seven mental operations.</p>
    <p>Other practices were the &quot;assumption of God-forms&quot;; by concentrated
    imagination of oneself in the symbolic shape of any God, one should be able to identify
    oneself with the idea which He represents. There there was meditation on simple symbols
    with the idea of penetrating to their secret meaning. I was also to keep up my practices
    of astral visions and &quot;rising on the planes&quot;, in particular the special official
    method of invoking Adonai-ha-Aretz. I was also to continue the work Eckenstein had taught
    me, on his lines. As to more magical matters, I proposed to continue the evocation of
    elemental forces to visible appearance, to make various talismans and charge them with
    spiritual energy by means of meditation, and to continue the building up of my (so-called)
    astral body until it was sufficiently material to be perceptible to the ordinary physical
    sense of people whom I should visit in this shape. There will be found in my Magical
    Record numerous accounts af this last experiment.</p>
    <p>In the autumn of '98 my friend, J. L. Baker, whom I hastened to see in London on my
    return from the Alps, took me on my first astral journey. The details of the method are
    given in full in <em>The Equinox</em>, Vol. I No. II, (<em>Liber
    O</em></a>). I may here outline them thus:</p>
    <p>Imagine an image of yourself, standing in from of you. Transfer your consciousness to
    it. Rise upward. Invoking forces desired by the prescribed methods. Observe their
    appearance. Test their authenticity. Enter into conversation with them. Travel under their
    guidance to the particular part of the universe which you desire to explore. Return to
    earth. Cause the Body of Light to coincide spatially with the physical. Reconnect them,
    using the sign of Harpocrates. Resume normal consciousness. Record the experience. Test
    its value by the critical methods advocated in <em>The Equinox</em>.</p>
    <p>After only a few such journeys I found myself much stronger on the wing that my tutor.
    He was always getting into trouble. Demoniac forms would threaten the circle. He tired
    easily. He often placed confidence in lying</p>
    <p>{224}</p>
    <p>spirits. In fact, his goodwill exceeded his ability. It all came as natural to me as
    swimming does to a duck. I picked up all the technical tricks of the trade almost by
    instinct; such as enable one to detect imposition on the instant, to banish disturbing
    elements, to penetrate the veils and pacify the warders of the secret sanctuaries; and to
    assure the accuracy of the information obtained, by methods the precision of which
    precludes the possibility of coincidence.</p>
    <p>I soon found it necessary to develop the Body of Light. I explored such remote, exalted
    and well-guarded adyta that the necessary invocations and sacraments required more energy
    than was at the disposal of the Body of Light which normally separates from its physical
    envelope. The result was that I soon built up a body so powerful that it was clearly
    visible to the physical vision of all but the grossest types of humanity. It also acquired
    an independence of my conscious will which enabled it to travel on its own initiative
    without my knowledge. Strange tales began to circulate, some doubtless true, others
    probably coloured, and, of course, not a few baseless inventions.</p>
    <p>As a type of the first class, let me quote the following: G. H. Frater S.R.M.D. had
    asked me to visit him in Paris. He expected me in the afternoon. My train was late; I was
    tired and dirty. I postponed my call till the following day. To my surprise, my host and
    hostess did not greet me quite as I expected. In the course of our talk they made
    allusions which were quite unintelligible. At last we became aware that we were talking at
    crosspurposes. The crash came when Soror Vestigia insisted, &quot;But you said so yourself
    at tea!&quot; I couldn't remember that I had ever been there to tea. On my one previous
    visit I had lunched one day and dined the next, but no more. &quot;At tea!&quot; I echoed,
    bewildered. &quot;Yes, at tea!&quot; she repeated. &quot;Surely you remember. It was only
    yesterday.&quot; We compared times. I was then dozing in the train from Calais. It then
    came out that I had called quite normally, though I seemed tired and dazed. I had stayed
    about an hour. Nothing had let them to suspect that I was not physically present.</p>
    <p>Of the third class, I remember chiefly that my Sister Fidelis was cursed with a
    horrible mother, a sixth-rate singer, a first-rate snob, with dewlaps and a paunch; a
    match-maker, mischief-maker, maudlin and muddle-headed. The ghastly hag put it all round
    London and New York that I had entered her daughter's room at night in my Body of Light. I
    don't know whether she went beyond the vile suggestion. Even had the tale been true, which
    Fidelis disdainfully denied, the woman must have been as witless as she was worthless to
    splash her own daughter with such ditch-water.</p>
    <p>All the same, I feel grateful. Her stupid lie put it into my head to make the
    experiment in question, though of course with the knowledge and approval of the girl. The
    result is recorded in a subsequent chapter.</p>
    <p>{225}</p>
    <p>When I began to develop this power consciously, I obtained considerable success. At the
    time of this journey I had arranged to visit a sister of the Order who lived in Hong Kong;
    at prearranged times, so that she might be looking out for me. Several of these visits
    turned out well. She saw and heard me; and on comparing notes, we found that our reports
    of the conversation agreed. But I was not able to act on &quot;matter&quot;. I used to try
    to knock things off the mantelpiece, but in vain. On the other hand, when I reached Hong
    Kong, I recognized the place perfectly and picked out her house on the hillside, thought I
    had never seen so much as a photograph.</p>
    <p>These numerous practices were assigned to a regular schedule. Five different periods of
    the day were to be devoted to one or the other.</p>
    <p>On May 3rd I left for Honolulu on the <em>Nippon Maru</em>, arriving on the ninth. A
    strange destiny lay in ambush for me among the palms.</p>
    <p>The poetical side of me is annoyed to this day when I think of it. I ought to have
    followed the ideal of Gauguin. It was absurd to have got so far only to fall in love with
    a white woman. I know now that white women introduce the idea of impurity into love in one
    way or another. There is something either vicious or intellectual about them. Love should
    be a strictly physiological matter, with just that amount of natural emotion that goes
    with it. But then, such simple happiness is not for me.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, I decided to spend a month on Waikiki Beach. I had a vague idea of getting a
    hut and a native girl, and devoting myself to poetry of the most wholesome kind with
    corresponding Magick. However, at the hotel was an exquisitely beautiful American woman of
    Scottish origin. She was ten years older than myself and had a boy with her just entering
    into his teens. She was married to a lawyer in the States and had come to Hawaii to escape
    hay fever.</p>
    <p>I went on with my magical and other work; in particular, I invented a practice which
    has proved very useful. Its object is to prevent mosquitoes from biting one. The method
    is: to love them. One reminds oneself that the mosquito has as much right to his dinner as
    a man has. It is difficult to get the exact shade of feeling and more so to feel it. One
    begins by lying defenceless against the enemy and sternly repressing the impulse to wave,
    to slap and to scratch. After a little perseverance, one finds that the bites no longer
    become inflamed; and this preliminary success is soon followed by complete protection. The
    will not bite one at all.</p>
    <p>But my horizon gradually filled with romantic love and other occupations faded little
    by little. The woman was herself worthless from the points of view of the poet. Only very
    exceptional characters are capable of producing the positive effect; but it is just such
    women as Alice who inspire masterpieces, for they do not interfere with one's work.
    Passionately as I was in love, and crazily as I was behaving in consequence, I was still
    able to make daily notes</p>
    <p>{226}</p>
    <p>of the progress of the affair with the detached cynicism of a third party. I took her
    with me to Japan<strong>1</strong>, but there was not enough in her character to count
    &quot;the world well lost for love&quot;. Exactly fifty days after I had met her she beat
    it back to her &quot;provider&quot;; and I understood immediately why my subconsciousness
    had insisted on my scribbling the details of our liaison in my diary.</p>
    <p>The departure of Alice inspired me to write the story of our love in a sonnet sequence.
    Each day was to immortalize its events in poetry. This again was one of my
    characteristically crude ideas, yet the result was surprisingly good --- much better,
    perhaps, than I ever thought, or think now. No less a critic than Marcel Schwob called it
    &quot;a little masterpiece&quot;. And many other people of taste and judgment have
    professed themselves in love with it. Possibly the simplicity of its realism, its sincere
    and shame-free expression of every facet of my mind, constitute real merit. It is
    certainly true that most people find much of my work hard to read. The intensity of my
    passion, the profundity of my introspection, and my addiction to obscure allusions, demand
    the reader serious study, that he may grasp my meaning; and subsequent re-reading after my
    thought has been assimilated; until, no intellectual obstacle interrupting, he may be
    carried away by the current of my music and swept but it into the ocean of ecstasy which I
    myself reached when I wrote the poem. I am aware that few modern readers are capable of
    settling down deliberately to decipher me. And those who are may for that very reason be
    incapable of the orgiastic frenzy. Scholarship and passion rarely go together. But my muse
    is the daughter of Hermes and the mistress of Dionysus.</p>
    <p>I saw comparatively little of Japan. I did not understand the people at all and
    therefore did not like them very much. Their aristocracy was somehow at odds with mine. I
    resented their racial arrogance. I compared them unfavourably with the Chinese. Like the
    English, they possess the insular qualities and defects. They are not Asiatic, exactly as
    we are not European.</p>
    <p>My most interesting impression was Kamakura. The Daibutsu, colossal amid his gardens of
    iris, with no canopy but the sky, does really produce a sense of his universality; it does
    remind one of the grandeur and solidity of his teaching; of the reasonableness of his
    methods of attainment, the impersonal peace which is their reward; and of the boundless
    scope of his philosophy, independent as it is of all arbitrary assumptions, parochial
    points of view, sordid appeals and soul-stupefying superstitions.</p>
    <p>Already there had arisen in me the aspiration to attain to states whose very</p>
    <p>{227}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">On the <em>America Manu</em>. There were many ladies on board: the wife
        of a railway magnate, the consul's daughter, ad so on. In reality, they were all whores
        destined for various brothels in Japan or Shanghai, where American ladies fetch absurd
        prices.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>possibility I did not suspect; already I was aware, in the abyss of my heart, secret
    and silent, that I was Alastor, the wanderer in the wilderness, the Spirit of Solitude.
    For Kamakura, calmly certain of its soul-searching accents, called to me to abide in the
    security of its shadow, there to toil even as the Buddha had done, that I might come to
    the perfect Illumination, and thereby being made free from all the fetters of falsehood,
    being to mankind the Word of Wisdom and magic that hath might to enlighten their eyes, to
    heal their hearts, and to bring them to a stage of spiritual evolution such that their
    poets could not longer lament, as I:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Nothing is stranger to men<br>
          Than silence, and wisdom, and kindness.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I inquired as to the possibility of settling down on one of the neighbouring
    monasteries; but somehow my instinct opposed my intention. The Inmost knew that my destiny
    lay elsewhere. The Lords of Initiation cared nothing for my poetic fancies and my romantic
    ideals. They had ordained that I should pass through every kind of hardship at the hands
    of nature, suffer all sorrow and shame that life can inflict. Their messenger must be
    tested by every ordeal --- not by those that he himself might choose. The boy who, asked
    to discuss some point of doctrine in the Epistles, replied, &quot;Far be it from me to
    presume to parley with St. Paul: let me rather give a list of the kings of Israel and
    Judah!&quot; (the only thing he knew), probably became a Cabinet minister; but similar
    adroitness does not avail the aspirant to adeptship. The Masters test every link in turn,
    infallibly and inexorably; it is up to you to temper your steel to stand the strain; for
    one flaw means failure and you have to forge it all afresh in the fires of fate, retrieve
    in a new incarnation the lost opportunity of the old.</p>
    <p>I turned then sadly from Daibutsu, as I had turned from love, ambition and ease, my
    spirit silently acquiescing in the arcane arbitrament of the mysterious daimon who drove
    me darkly onward; how I knew not, whither I knew not, but only this, that he was
    irresistible as inscrutable, yet no less trustworthy than titanic.</p>
    <p>Alas! The failure of Alice to reach the summit of live! Thence are the valleys of
    virtue, the rivers of respectability and the sheepfolds of society seen dim and dull in
    the distance, bestially beneath our sparkling snows, or shoreless sky, our sacred sun and
    sentinel stars.</p>
    <p>Alice had broken my boy's heart; she had taught me what women were worth. For her I had
    surrendered my single-iminded devotion to my spiritual Quest; I had sold my soul to the
    devil for sixpence, and the coin was counterfeit.</p>
    <p>True, one of me knew all along the augury of the adventure; but then, all the worse!
    For if Alice had been a real danger, might not I have damned</p>
    <p>{228}</p>
    <p>myself for her, as many a knight for Venus of the Hollow Hill, as many a saint for
    Lilith, Lady of the Lake of Fire? Yet no: the answer came, august and austere, from mine
    Angel, that I had passed the Ordeal. I had proved that no passion, however pure and
    powerful, could enslave me. The caresses of no Calypso could chain me in her courts, the
    cup of Circe corrupt my chastity, the song of no Siren seduce me to suicide, the wiles of
    no Vivien ensnare my simplicity and bind me in the hollow oak of Broceliande.</p>
    <p>I had intoxicated myself utterly with Alice; I had invested her with all the insignia
    that my imagination could invent. Yet, loving her with all my heart and soul, she had not
    seduced me from my service. I knew --- and They who put her on my Path knew also --- that
    I was immune. I might dally with Delilah as much as I liked and never risk the scissors.
    Love, who binds other Samsons, blinds them and sets them to serve the Philistines, to be
    their scorn and sport, would be to me my Light and lead me in the way of liberty. The
    secret of my strength was the, that love would always stand a shining symbol of my truth,
    that I loved spiritually the soul of mankind. Therefore each woman, be she chaste or
    wanton, faithful or false, inspiring me to scale the summits of song or whispering me to
    wallow in the swamps of sin, would be to me no more than a symbol in whose particular
    virtue my love could fins the bread and wine of its universal eucharist.</p>
    <p>Time has confirmed this claim: I have loved many women and been loved. But I have never
    wavered from my Work; and always a moment has come when the woman had to choose between
    comradeship and catastrophe. For in truth, there was no Aleister Crowley to love; there
    was only a Word for the utterance of which a human form had been fashioned. So the foolish
    virgins, finding that love and vanity could not live together, gave up a man for a mirror;
    but the wise, knowing that man is mortal, gave up the world for the Work and thereby
    cheated satiety, disillusionment and death.</p>
    <p>Yet, so fearful was I at this time that I had failed and shown myself unfit to
    accomplish the terrific Tasks, to undertake which must be, as I was warned by some secret
    sense, the only honour I could accept from the High Gods, that I continued my journey to
    Ceylon in a mood not only contrite but confused. The calm soft loveliness of the Inland
    Sea brought no peace to my spirit; indeed, it made scarcely any impression upon my
    aesthetic sense. The sordid scramble of the foreign settlement of Shanghai stirred my
    scorn without rousing me from my stupefaction. In spite of the subtle passion to
    assimilate China which had taken possession of me in San Francisco, I could not so much as
    indulge in a saunter through the native city. I wanted to reach Hong Kong and tell my
    troubles to my Sister Fidelis. She would understand, judge, encourage and advise, none
    better. In the days of the G.'. D.'. debacle, her purity, her fearlessness, her loyalty,
    her scorn of all dishonourable device</p>
    <p>{229}</p>
    <p>and deed, her single-heartedness, her eager and ecstatic aspiration: these had made
    sweet those struggles against the stupid, selfish sectaries with their petty pique, their
    treacherous trickeries, their slanders and squabbles.</p>
    <p>Ah me! the Gods were at their grim game; they had another dagger ready to slip between
    my ribs. Fidelis was now a married woman. She was still playing at Magick, as another
    might play at bridge. But her true life was dresses, dinners and dances; and her thought
    were taken up by her husband and her lover. (In hot countries, white men being relaxed by
    the climate, European women, over-stimulated for the same reason, almost inevitably
    practise polyandry.)</p>
    <p>And she had won the first prize at a fancy dress ball by appearing in her adept's robes
    and regalia!</p>
    <p>No hope here, then! Nay, nor elsewhere! I saw clearly enough that the Gods meant me to
    work out my own puzzles without human help. I must stand alone. Well and good, so be it! I
    had the sense to accept the Ordeal as a compliment. The umbilical cord was cut: I was an
    independent being, with his own way to make in the world.</p>
    <p>On the boat from Yokohama to Shanghai were two American spinsters of the faded variety,
    with parchment skin due to dryness of climate and devotion to virtue and cocktails.
    Hearing that I was interested in literature, hope revived. They told me their favorite
    poet was Rossetti. I was tactless enough to ask which of his poems they had read and
    preferred, but it did not runt to that. It was sufficiently daring to have heard of
    Rossetti. Only absolute shamelessness would read him. Somewhat abashed, they informed me
    that a colleague was travelling on this boat, no less than Thomas Hardy. Naturally I
    jumped and begged an introduction.</p>
    <p>Thomas Hardy was a tall, dignified, venerable figure, with a patriarchal beard and
    manner equally courteous and authoritative. I had not known he was a clergyman --- as his
    costume assured me. After a little conversation, I began to surmise dimly that there was
    something wrong, and might have said something tactless if he had not volunteered an
    account of his literary career and been quite unaware of the existence of the Mayor of
    Casterbridge. He was the &quot;great&quot; Thomas Hardy, the only and original bird, the
    chaplain to the forces at Hong Kong and author of <em>How to be happy though married</em>.
    I don't know how I kept my face straight.</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, he was perfectly human and even contributed a quite valuable item
    of information as to the psychology of publishers. He had aproached one of these ineffable
    imbeciles<strong>1</strong> with his book and been told that while the text was all that
    could be desired, it was quite impossible to publish a book with that title. The reverend
    gentleman had the good sense to reply,</p>
    <p>{230}<ol>
