    <p>Beside all these activities of my own, I came into a new world. My Operation of the
    Sacred Magick was not sterile. After returning from Morocco, the spirit came upon me and I
    wrote a number of books in a way which I hardly know how to describe. They were not taken
    from dictation like <em>The Book of the Law</em> nor were they my own composition. I
    cannot even call them automatic writing. I can only say that I was not wholly conscious at
    the time of what I was writing, and I felt that I had no right to &quot;change&quot; so
    much as the style of a letter. They were written with the utmost rapidity without pausing
    for thought for a single moment, and I have not presumed to revise them. Perhaps
    &quot;Plenary inspiration&quot; is the only adequate phrase, and this has become so
    discredited that people are loth to admit the possibility of such a thing.</p>
    <p>The prose of these books, the chief of which are <em>Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente</em>,
    <em>The Book of the Heart girt with the Serpent</em>, and <em>Libri
    vel Lapidis Lazuli</em></a>, is wholly different from anything that I have written myself.
    It is characterized by a sustained sublimity of which I am totally incapable and it
    overrides all the intellectual objections which I should myself have raised. It does not
    admit the need to explain itself to anyone, even to me. I cannot doubt that these books
    are the work of an intelligence independent of my own. The former describes the relation
    of the adept with his Holy Guardian Angel; the latter is &quot;The voluntary emancipation
    of a certain adept from his adeptship ... the birth words of a Master of the Temple.&quot;</p>
    <p>Even this did not exhaust my creative energy. As in Cairo in 1902 I had started the
    &quot;Lover's Alphabet&quot;, on the ground that the most primitive kind of lyrics or odes
    was in some way the most appealing and immortal, so I decided to write a series of hymns
    to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the simplest possible style. I must not be thought exactly
    insincere, though I had certainly no shadow of belief in any of the Christian dogmas,
    least of all in this adaptation and conglomeration of Isis, Semele, Astarte, Cybele,
    Freya, and so many others; I simply tried to see the world through the eyes of a devout
    Catholic, very much as I had done with the decadent poet of <em>White Stains</em>, the
    Persian mystic of the <em>Bagh-i-Muattar</em>, and so on. I was, in fact, adopting another
    alias --- in the widest sense of the word.</p>
    <p>I did not see why I should be confined to one life. How can one hope to understand the
    world if one persists in regarding it from the conning tower of one's own personality? One
    can increase one's knowledge and nature by</p>
    <p>{559}</p>
    <p>travelling and reading; but that does not tell one how things look to other people. It
    is all very well to visit St. Peter's and the Vatican, but what would be really
    interesting would be to know how they look to the Pope. The greatness of a poet consists,
    to a considerable extent, in his ability to see the world through another man's eyes; and
    my training in science is always suggesting to me that I should invent a technique for
    doing anything that I want to do. My technique for borrowing other people's spectacles was
    to put myself in the place altogether, either by actually adopting a suitable alias or by
    writing a book in their names. It is a common and legitimate literary device.</p>
    <p>When in Holland in '97, I had written a Christmas hymn in which the Nativity was
    treated realistically. I now found that Christian piety had taken away the entire poetic
    beauty of Bethlehem by declaring that the Virgin suffered no pain. (It is really
    astonishing how these idiots managed to remove any touch of sublimity from this stupid
    story!) I therefore had to change &quot;her bitter anguish hath sufficed&quot; into
    &quot;her joyful ardour hath sufficed&quot;, and otherwise degrade my poem to a
    blasphemous imbecility, in order to comply with the conventions of the Church. Apart from
    that, what I had written in a spirit not far removed from ribaldry was found wholly
    satisfactory.</p>
    <p>I had written, in 1899, while staying with Mathers in Paris, a hymn to Isis to be used
    in the ceremonies of Isis worship which he was at that time proposing to revive in Paris.
    I changed the word &quot;Sistron&quot; to &quot;cymbal&quot; and the word &quot;Isis&quot;
    to &quot;Mary&quot;. The hymn required no further alteration. I think that rather
    significant.</p>
    <p>Once more, I made a translation of the Fatihah, the most sacred chapter of the Koran, I
    replaced the name of God by that of Mary, and once again found favour with the Vatican.</p>
    <p>I quote a few isolated stanzas:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The red sun scorches up our veins;<br>
        The white moon makes us mad;<br>
        Pitiless stars insult our pains<br>
        With clamour glad.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At the foot of the Cross is the Mother of God,<br>
      And Her tears are like rain to enliven the sod,<br>
      While the Blood of the Lord from his Body that runs<br>
      Is the heat of the summer, the fire of its suns.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>See where the cherubim pallid and plumed<br>
        Swing with their thuribles praises perfumed!<br>
        Jesus is risen and Mary assumed:<br>
        Ave Maria!</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{560}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>O sorrow of pure eyes beneath<br>
        The heavy-fringed estatic lids,<br>
        Seeing for maiden song and wreath<br>
        Sphinxes and pagan pyramids!</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>O Mary, like a pure perfume<br>
        Do thou receive this failing breath,<br>
        And with Thy starry lamp illume<br>
        The darkling corridors of death!</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There was besides such creative work and the editorial work which Fuller and I had
    undertaken on behalf of the Order, the task of reconstituting it in its original purity.
    Under Mathers, the Grades had become meaningless; to be an adept had meant no more than to
    be a peer of the realm does in modern times. It was for me to sweep away all this
    nonsense, to re-establish the ordeals, in spirit and in truth. I was at first ignorant
    enough of Magick to imagine that this could be done by the simple process of replacing
    sham formalities by real ones. I proposed, for example, to test people's courage by
    putting them in actual contact with the four elements, and so on, as was apparently done
    in ancient Egypt; but experience soon taught me that an ordeal, however severe, is not
    much use in genuine initiation. A man can always more or less brace himself up to meet a
    situation when he knows that he is on his trial. A man might have a certificate of ability
    to swim half a mile; and yet be utterly unable, for a dozen different reasons, to save a
    friend from drowning when the need arose.</p>
    <p>Of course it sounds totally impossible to administer ordeals of the real kind required,
    but I found by experience that I did not even have to give the matter a moment's thought.
    My magical self took complete charge of the business without wasting a moment or
    disturbing me. It may be through some act of my own, it may be entirely without my
    intention, that aspirants to the Order find themselves in circumstances where they are
    tested in the qualities necessary to their stage of initiation. There is thus no
    possibility of evading the intentions of the Order. It is not conducted consciously by any
    men soever, but by mysterious forces automatically set in motion by the force of the
    obligations themselves.</p>
    <p>For example; the oath of a probationer apparently involves no difficulties of any sort;
    no penalties are stated or implied; the aspirant merely pledges himself &quot;to perform
    the Great Work, which is to obtain the knowledge of the nature and powers of my own
    being&quot;. He is not required to reach any particular stage of knowledge by the end of
    his probation; he is free to choose such practices as appeal to him; and, provided that
    his record shows that he has devoted a reasonable proportion of his spare time to the
    Work, he is</p>
    <p>{561}</p>
    <p>unhesitatingly passed to the degree of neophyte. It sounds as if it were impossible for
    anyone to fail. Yet, actually only eight per cent. manage to get through the year of
    probation. The reason is that no sooner does a man make up his mind to enter the Path of
    the Wise than he rouses automatically the supreme hostility of every force, internal or
    external, in his sphere.</p>
    <p>I further restored the original rule of the Order that its members should not know each
    other officially and have as little to do with teach other as possible. Theoretically, a
    member should know only his introducer and those whom he himself introduces. In the
    present conditions of society it is practically impossible to maintain this rule with
    absolute strictness, but I keep as near to the ideal as possible. I did relax the rule, to
    a certain extent, in 1910 --- it was the greatest mistake I had ever made, and the
    mischief done at that time has never been wholly repaired. Every month I live I am the
    more amazed at the praeterhuman wisdom and foresight of the Order. I have never known a
    mistake to be made; whereas my conscious posers are constantly at fault. If I had no other
    evidence of the authority of the people to whom I am pledged, it would be supplied by
    their wisdom.</p>
    <p>It happened that at the funeral of Saladin, Fuller had met a youth named Neuburg,
    Victor Benjamin of that ilk, who was at Trinity College, Cambridge, and knew my work.
    Having to go to Cambridge one day on some business or other, I thought I would look the
    lad up. I was not sure of the name, and there were several similar &quot;burgs&quot; in
    the university register, but having drawn my bow at a venture, the first arrow struck the
    King of Israel between the harness at the very first shot. I use the words &quot;King of
    Israel&quot; advisedly, for Neuburg was certainly a most distinguished specimen of that
    race. He was a mass of nervous excitement, having reached the age of twenty-five without
    learning how to manage his affairs. He had been prevented from doing so, in fact, but all
    sorts of superstitions about the terrible danger of leading a normal wholesome life. The
    neuroses thus created had expressed themselves in a very feeble trickle of poetry and a
    very vehement gust of fads.</p>
    <p>He was an agnostic, a vegetarian, a mystic, a Tolstoyan, and several other things all
    at once. He endevoured to express his spiritual state by wearing the green star of
    Esperanto, though he could not speak the language; by refusing to wear a hat, even in
    London, to wash, and to wear trousers. Whenever addressed, he wriggled convulsively, and
    his lips, which were three times too large for him, and had been put on hastily as an
    afterthought, emitted the most extraordinary laugh that had ever come my way; to these
    advantages he united those of being extraordinarily well read, over flowing with
    exquisitely subtle humour, and being one of the best natured people that ever trod this
    planet.</p>
    <p>But from the first moment I saw him, I saw far more than this; I read an</p>
    <p>{562}</p>
    <p>altogether extraordinary capacity for Magick. We soon drifted into talking about the
    subject and I found that he already practised a good deal of spiritualism and
    clairvoyance. The former was his bane. The habit of making himself spiritually passive and
    inviting the entire spirit world to obsess him proved finally fatal to him. Despite all we
    could do to protect his aura, we found it impossible to stop the leak altogether, so that
    at any moment he was liable to become possessed of the devil. He soon learnt how to
    protect himself as soon as he recognized that he was being attacked; but the spirits
    became very cunning and were at pains to persuade him not to take the proper measures of
    protection. I believe, despite all this, that he would have succeeded eventually in
    mending his aura, but in the principal ordeal of the neophyte he was so seriously damaged
    that he was never the same man again. During the next few years I saw a great deal of him
    and his spiritual adventures will serve both as a diversion and warning on many a page to
    come.</p>
    <p>Recognizing the possibilities of Neuburg, I decided to utilize them for the benefit of
    the Order, and of himself. The first task was to get rid, as far as possible, of his
    physical defects, which turned out to be very serious. One day during our walk through
    Spain, we came upon a waterfall, and, the weather being oppressively hot, we decided to
    take a dip. In this way I discovered that he was suffering from varicocele very badly
    indeed and as soon as we got to England I sent him to my doctor, who advised an operation,
    which was duly performed. He had also pyorrhea so badly that my dentist said that if he
    had delayed the visit three weeks he would not have had a tooth left in his head.
    Attention to these points, and to the physical cause of his neurosis, made a healthy man
    of him. One defect remained; and that was incurable, being a slight spinal curvature. The
    change in him was extraordinary. He lost all his nervousness; he became capable of
    enduring great physical fatigue, of concentrating mentally, and of dismissing the old fads
    which had obsessed him. Incidentally, by removing his inhibitions, I released the spring
    of his genius, and in the next few years he produced some of the finest poetry of which
    the English language can boast. He had an extraordinary delicacy of rhythm, an unrivalled
    sense of perception, a purity and intensity of passion second to none, and a remarkable
    command of the English language.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>But the other voice was silent, and the noise of waters swept me<br>
      Back into the world, and I lay asleep on a hillside<br>
      Bearing for evermore the heart of a goddess,<br>
      And the brain of a man, and the wings of the morning<br>
      Clipped by the shears of the silence; so must I wander lonely,<br>
      Nor know of the light till I enter into the darkness.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He possessed the magical gift of conveying an idea of tremendous</p>
    <p>{563}</p>
    <p>vividness and importance by means of words that are unintelligible to the intellect.</p>
    <p align="center">I go as Thunder that come but as a bird.</p>
    <p>(And then the girl came as a bird, and he went as a worm --- but I anticipate.)</p>
    <p>Neuburg was the moving spirit of one of those societies which are always springing up
    in universities. They never take root; because death comes to all alike at the end of
    three years, so to speak. People who stay up for a fourth year are Ancient Mariners, but
    lack the power to hold the wedding guest. Of course people overlap; but the generations
    follow each other so quickly and the spirit of youth is so impotent to stamp itself upon
    history, that it is a rare piece of luck when any of these clubs or societies live beyond
    seven years at the outside. Neuburg's society, the Pan society, did make its mark on the
    university; but that was not its fault. It was simply that he found people idiotic enough
    to make it invulnerable against the arrows of oblivion by dipping it into the Styx of
    persecution. Nothing could have been more helpful than the attitude of the Dean of
    Trinity, an idiot and inept. I have noticed that people who dislike me are invariable
    rendered so blind by malice that they give themselves away and make themselves ridiculous.</p>
    <p>There is an institution at Cambridge called &quot;Ciccu&quot;, Cambridge
    Intercollegiate Christian Union. It is a bestial thing, compact of hypocrisy and secret
    vice. Now my connection with the Pan Society was of the slightest. I have merely been
    invited to read parers, I think altogether three times, on mysticism or kindred subjects.
    Nothing more harmless can be imagined, but the Ciccu went out of its mind. I am compelled
    to remark at this point that one of the most disgraceful features of controversy in
    England is that the upholders of religion and morality, which are frequently not at all in
    question, instead of disputing with their opponents, assail them with the weapons of
    secret slander. &quot;This man,&quot; they say, &quot;wants to take a penny off the income
    tax. It is certain that he habitually breaks the Seventh Commandment.&quot; In this
    instance the Ciccu did not know or care what it was that I had read to the Pan society.
    They merely stated that I hypnotized the entire assembly and took a mean advantage of
    them. It did not matter to them that what I was supposed to have done is impossible in
    nature, at least to one of my very mediocre powers.</p>
    <p>However, the Senior Dean of Trinity, the Rev. R. St. J. Parry, started to make trouble.
    I went to see him and asked him what accusations he had to make against me. He merely
    became confused, tried to bluster, would not commit himself, and finally said that he had
    given orders that I was not to be admitted to the precincts of the college. On the
    following morning I waited in the Great Court for him to come out of chapel and called him
    a liar to</p>
    <p>{564}</p>
    <p>his face in front of everybody. It then began to dawn upon him that he had no power to
    exclude me from Trinity, I being a life member of the college. He summoned the president,
    secretary and treasurer of the society, and threatened to send them down. But as it
    happened they none of them belonged to Trinity and he had no more power over them than he
    had over the Queen of Madagascar. He must have been a really exceptional fool, even for a
    don, not to have found out such essential facts before entering upon his campaign. He
    ultimately resorted to the meanest possible course of action. He did not dare to attack
    Neuburg, whose relations were wealthy Jews and might be relied upon to make every kind of
    trouble if he interfered with the hope of Israel; but he threatened a man named Norman
    Mudd, whose parents were poor and without influence, with the loss of his mathematical
    scholarship. Unfortunately again, Mudd was the mainstay of the hope of the college for the
    forthcoming Tripos, and Mudd himself had the heart of a lion. He dared the dean to do his
    damndest in the most uncompromising language. Once again the wretched creature had to draw
    in his horns. Only after I had left the battlefield to seek other victories did he succeed
    in bullying Mudd into resignation from the society by frightening his father. Mudd gave
    his promise to have no more to do with it --- and promptly broke it. The Pan society won
    all along the line.</p>
    <p>The victory was all the more signal in that an imitation society called the Heretics,
    who had been trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds like the Rationalist
    Press Association, had melted away into the thinnest kind of mist at the first intimation
    from the authorities that their exceedingly mild programme of half-baked infidelity was
    displeasing to the powers that were. The whole incident was trivial in its way, but it
    taught me an important lesson of policy. The more upright and uncompromising one is, the
    safer one is from attack. One's enemies will resort to the most despicable subterfuges,
    but they will not have the courage to come into the open and they will in one way or
    another fall into the pit which they dig. It is true that one can apparently be damaged by
    secret slander, when the enemy become foolhardy by open misrepresentation, but if one is
    working in the eternal one may be sure that they harm no one but themselves. Suppose, for
    example, that I attack Lloyd George by saying that he had undergone seven years' penal
    servitude for burglary, and suppose Lloyd George treats me with the contempt I deserve.
    Well, at the moment there may be a few people silly enough to believe such nonsense, and
    to think that his allowing the statement to go unchallenged makes it probable that there
    is some truth in it. But consider what the biographers will say? They will discover that
    Lloyd George's time was fully accounted for without the penal servitude, and they will
    simply wonder what spirit of insanity possessed me to make so ridiculous a mis-statement.
    They will have</p>
    <p>{565}</p>
    <p>no difficulty in understanding that he, preoccupied with affairs of state, could not be
    bothered to leave his work to chastise me.</p>
    <p>Another consideration arises in this connection. It is always difficult to discover who
    has really said what about one, and even if one succeeds it is not always the best policy
    to refute the falsehoods. If people were attacking one by merely falsifying or
    exaggerating actual incidents, defence would be possible; but when people are bound merely
    by the limits of their vile imaginations, it is not easy to keep pace with them. What is
    the use of Lloyd George proving that he did not undergo penal servitude for burglary if I
    can retort, &quot;Perhaps not, but you were hanged for sheep stealing!&quot; To defend
    oneself against the accusations of a knave is to seek justice from the verdict of fools.
    If one's work and one's reputation depends on the opinion of people at the moment, it is,
    of course, necessary to meet them on their own ground. At every election the most
    ridiculous falsehoods about the candidates are sedulously circulated at the last moment;
    if possible, too late to allow time for refutation. The election may doubtless depend on
    such infected activities.</p>
    <p>But when one is working in the eye of God, when one cares nothing for the opinion of
    men, either at the moment or at any other time; when one has surrendered for ever one's
    personal interests and become lost in one's work, it is merely waste of time and
    derogatory to one's dignity to pay attention to irrelevant interruptions about one's
    individual affairs. One keeps one's powder and shot for people who attack one's work
    itself. And even this is often useless. The Buddha told his disciples not to combat error.
    If it had only seven heads like the Lennean hydra it might be possible to sterilize the
    necks after each operation sufficiently long to finish the job before they grow again. But
    modern hydras have not this pitiful paucity of talking machines. Hardly a month passes but
    I hear some new and perfectly fantastic yarn about myself, sometimes flattering, sometimes
    the reverse, but nearly always entirely baseless, and, as often as not, bearing internal
    evidence of its absurdity. I have been sufficiently amused to wish to make a collection of
    these legends, but I find that my memory refuses to record rubbish of this kind. It
    insists on having some peg whereon to hang its old clothes.</p>
    <p>I am not sure whether it was Henry Maudsley who shows that the mind develops not by
    accretion but by co-ordination. It seems that there is a certain number of pigeon-holes,
    if I may use the metaphor, in which isolated facts may be stored, and that this number is
    strictly limited. The efficiency of the arrangement may doubtless be increased by practice
    and the use of mnemonics, but sooner or later one comes to the end. A man of forty who has
    devoted every moment of his time to acquiring knowledge finds almost certainly that he has
    no more pigeon-holes available, and that therefore he cannot acquire any new knowledge
    except by forgetting some of the old.</p>
    <p>{566}</p>
    <p>This, by the way, shows the tremendous importance of selective study. One of the few
    gleams of intelligence shown in the works of Conan Doyle is where Sherlock Holmes is
    ignorant that the earth goes round the sun and, on being told, says that he will at once
    try to forget it. The case chosen exhibits the chooser as imbecile, for elementary
    astronomy is certainly important to the detective. But the general idea is sound.</p>
    <p>It is today implicitly admitted by all advanced thinkers in every science that the
    reason is no more than an exceedingly imperfect instrument whose methods are entirely
    empirical, whose terms lack precision, and whose theses cancel each other out. I might
    claim a good deal of credit for having written out, as far back as 1902, a reasonably
    complete demonstration of this conclusion whose premisses were not stated by the official
    leaders of thought till long afterwards. Yet the theory of initiation on which European
    adepts base their systems (derived, possibly, from the Egyptians and Chaldeans by way of
    the gnostics, Pythagoras and the neoplatonists), that of Lao tzu in China, and that of the
    Vedantists in India, alike imply something of the sort. My claim to originality is
    confined to the nature of my proof, which I drew from facts of a similar order to those
    which have finally driven modern science and mathematics to their present position;
    whereas the ancients, as far as we know, based their thesis on an intuitive perception of
    the incompetence of reason and on their experience of the results of illumination.</p>
    <p>I devoted a great deal of time to various essays demonstrative of the general truth
    above set forth<strong>1</strong> and to this practical problem. I took all the mystical
    and magical practices of all religions all over the world, and those of the secret
    teachers and associations to which I had access. I have little hesitation in saying that I
    have not omitted any practice of importance. I stripped these methods of all their
    dogmatic top-hamper, all their racial and climatic limitations, and all the complications
    which had been introduced in the course of time or through the idiosyncrasies of their
    inventors. I further freed them from the weight of the promised rewards which were
    supposed to follow on their performance. I wrote down the result in the simplest and most
    dignified prose at my command, clarifying the instructions by separating them into
    sections.</p>
    <p>I guided myself by the principle that the object of any useful practice soever must
    necessarily be to get rid of some limitation. Thus the real object of Asana is evidently
    to release the body from the pain which is its normal characteristic; that of Mantra Yoga
    to smooth the choppy sea of thought by inducing its movement to take the form of
    rhythmical billows. In this way I set forth the initiated teaching of all ages and all
    arts in a uniform and consistent body of writing, being careful nowhere to imply any
    theory soever.</p>

    <p>This work extended over a number of years, but the fundamental principles were laid
    down at this time. It is just to say that the publication of these instructions completely
    revolutionized occult training. It may not seem so very important on the surface to have
    adhered to the point of view without altering the practice, but in reality the difference
    is vital. For instance, there is a book, &quot;Liber Jugorum&quot;, in which the student
    takes an oath to exclude a certain thought, word or act, for a given period, and on every
    occasion of forgetfulness to cut himself on the wrist with a razor.</p>
