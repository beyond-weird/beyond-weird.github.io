    <p>We had one or two other peoÿle with us, in particular a man named Paley Gardner, who
    had been with Eckenstein at Wastdale at Ester.&nbsp; He was a man of giant strength, but
    could not be taught to climb the simplest rocks. He always tried to pull the mountain down
    to him instead of pulling himself up to it!&nbsp; He was one of the best fellows that ever
    walked and had led an extraordinary life of which he was too silent and too shy to speak.
    &nbsp; But he loosened up to some extent in camp; and two of his adventures are so
    remarkable that I feel they ought to be rescued from oblivion.</p>
    <p>He was a rich man, but on once occasion found himself stranded in Sydney and too lazy
    to wire for money.&nbsp; At this juncture he met a man who offered to take him trading in
    the islands.&nbsp; They got a schooner, a crew and some stores; set off; sold their stuff;
    and started home.&nbsp; Then small pox broke out on board and every man died by Paley, who
    sailed the schooner, singlehanded, seven days back to Sydney.</p>
    <p>On another occasion he found himself at Lima during the battle; if you can call it a
    battle when everyone thought it the best bet to shoot anyone he saw as a mater of general
    principle.&nbsp; Paley, being a man of peace, took up a position on a remote wall with the
    idea of shooting anyone that approached in case of his proving unfriendly.&nbsp; However,
    the first person that arrived was obviously an Englishman.&nbsp; They recognized each
    other and proceeded to concert measures for escape.</p>
    <p>The newcomer, a doctor with long experience of South America, suggested that if they
    could only cross a broad belt of country inhabited by particularly malignant Indian
    tribes, and the Andes, they could reach the head waters of the Amazon and canoe down to
    Iquitos, where they would be in clover, as the doctor was a close friend of Dom Somebody,
    a powerful minister or other high official.&nbsp; They started off on this insane
    programme and carried it out (after innumerable adventures) with success.&nbsp; Arriving
    at Iquitos, ragged and penniless, but confident that the minister's friendship would put
    them on a good wicket at once, they sought the local authorities --- and learnt that their
    friend had been hanged a few days before, and that anyone who knew him might expect a
    similar solution to his troubles!</p>
    <p>The two Englishmen were thrown into prison, but broke out and bolted down the river.
    &nbsp; The hue and cry was raised; but, just as their pursuers were closing in on them,
    the managed to steal a fishing smack, with which they put out into the oÿen Atlantic.
    &nbsp; Luckily, a few days later, when they were on</p>
    <p>{163}</p>
    <p>the brink of starvation, they fell in with an English steamer bound for Liverpool.
    &nbsp; The captain picked them up and took them home in triumph.</p>
    <p>The weather made it impossible to do any serious climbing; but I learnt a great deal
    about the work of a camp at high altitudes, from the management of transport to cooking;
    in fact, my chief claim to fame is, perhaps, my &quot;glacier curry&quot;.&nbsp; It was
    very amusing to see these strong men, inured to every danger and hardship, dash out of the
    tent after one mouthful and wallow in the snow, snapping at it like mad dogs.&nbsp; The
    admitted, however, that it was very good as curry and I should endeavour to introduce it
    into London restaurants if there were only a glacier. Perhaps, some day, after a heavy
    snowfall ---</p>
    <p>I had been led, in the course of my reading, to <em>The Kabbalah Unveiled</em>, by S.
    L. Mathers.&nbsp; I didn't understand a word of it, but it fascinated me all the more for
    that reason, and it was my constant study on the glacier. My health was not good during
    this summer and I had gone down to Zermatt for a rest.&nbsp; One night in the beer hall I
    started to lay down the law on alchemy, which I nowise understood.&nbsp; But it was a
    pretty safe subject on which to spread myself and I trust that I impressed the group of
    men with my vast learning.&nbsp; However, my destiny was in ambush.&nbsp; One of the
    party, named Julian L. Baker, was an analytical chemist.&nbsp; He took me aside when the
    group broke up and walked back to the hotel with me.&nbsp; He was himself a real practical
    alchemist --- I don't know whether he had been fooled by my magpie display of erudition.
    &nbsp; He may simply have deduced that a boy, however vain and foolish, who had taken so
    much pains to read up the subject, might have a really honest interest after all; and he
    took me seriously.&nbsp; He had accomplished some remarkable work in alchemy.&nbsp; For
    one thing, he had prepared &quot;fixed mercury&quot;; that is to say, the pure metal in
    some form that was solid at ordinary temperatures.</p>
    <p>As for me, I made no mistake.&nbsp; I felt that the moment of opportunity was come.
    &nbsp; I had sent out the S.O.S. call for a Master during that Easter at Wastdale Head;
    and here was a man who was either one himself or could put me in touch with one.&nbsp; It
    struck me as more than a coincidence that I should have been led to meet him partly
    through my ill-health and partly through my fatuous vanity.&nbsp; That night I resolved to
    renew my acquaintance with Baker in the morning and tackle him seriously about the
    intricate question which lay close about my heart.</p>
    <p>The morrow dawned.&nbsp; At breakfast I inquired for Baker.&nbsp; He had left the
    hotel; no one knew where he had gone.&nbsp; I telegraphed all over the valley.&nbsp; He
    was located at the Gorner Grat.&nbsp; I sped up the mountain to find him.&nbsp; Again he
    had gone.&nbsp; I rushed back.&nbsp; In vain I hunted him through the hotels and at the
    railway station.&nbsp; At last I got a report than an Englishmen corresponding to</p>
    <p>{164}</p>
    <p>his description had started to walk down the valley to Brigue.&nbsp; I hurled myself
    headlong in pursuit.&nbsp; This time I was rewarded.&nbsp; I caught up with him some ten
    miles below Zermatt.&nbsp; I told him of my search for the Secret Sanctuary of the Saints
    and convinced him of my desperate earnestness.&nbsp; He hinted that he knew of an Assembly
    which might be that for which I was looking.&nbsp; He spoke of a Sacrament where the
    elements were four instead of two.&nbsp; This meant nothing to me; but I felt that I was
    on the right track. I got him to promise to meet me in London.&nbsp; He added, &quot;I
    will introduce you to a man who is much more of a Magician than I am.&quot;</p>
    <p>To sum the matter in brief, he kept his word.&nbsp; The Secret Assembly materialized as
    the &quot;Hermetic Order of the G.·. D.·.,&quot;&nbsp; and the Magician as one George
    Cecil Jones.</p>
    <p>During the whole summer, the weather got steadily worse and my health took the same
    course.&nbsp; I found myself obliged to leave the camp and go to London to see doctors.
    &nbsp; I took rooms in an hotel in London, attended to the necessary medical treatment and
    spent my time writing poetry.&nbsp; The play <em>Jephthah</em> was my principal work at
    this period.&nbsp; It shows a certain advance in bigness of conception; and has this
    notable merit, that I began to realize the possibility of objective treatment of a theme.
    &nbsp; Previous to this, my lyrics had been more or less successful expressions of the
    ego; and I had made few attempts to draw characters who were not more than Freudian wish
    phantasms --- I mean by this that they were either projections of myself as I fancied
    myself or aspired to be; otherwise, images of women that I desired to love.&nbsp; When I
    say &quot;to Love&quot;, I doubt whether the verb meant anything more than &quot;to find
    myself through&quot;.&nbsp; But in <em>Jephthah</em>, weak as the play is, I was really
    taking an interest in other people.&nbsp; The characters are not wholly corrupted by
    self-portraiture, I suck to the Hebrew legend accurately enough, merely introducing a
    certain amount of Cabbalistic knowledge.</p>
    <p>The passionate dedication to Swinburne is significant of my literary hero-worship.
    &nbsp; With this play were published (in 1899) a number of lyrics entitled
    &quot;Mysteries, Lyrical and Dramatic&quot;.&nbsp; The shallow critic hastily assumed that
    the influence of Swinburne was paramount in my style, but on rereading the volume I do not
    think that the accusation is particularly justifiable.&nbsp; There are plenty of other
    authors who might more reasonably be served with an affiliation summons.&nbsp; Indeed,
    criticism in England amounts to this: that if a new writer manifests any sense of rhythm,
    he is classed as an imitator of Swinburne; if any capacity for thought, of Browning.</p>
    <p>I remember one curious incident in connection with this volume.&nbsp; I had a set of
    paged proofs in my pocket one evening, when I went to call on W. B. Yeats.&nbsp; I had
    never though much of his work; it seemed to me to lack virility.&nbsp; I have given an
    extended criticism of it in <em>The Equinox</em> (vol.
    I No. II</a>, page 307). &nbsp; However, at that time I should have been glad to have a </p>
    <p>{165}</p>
    <p>kindly word from an elder man.&nbsp; I showed him the proofs accordingly and he glanced
    through them.&nbsp; He forced himself to utter a few polite conventionalities, but I could
    see what the truth of the matter was.</p>
    <p>I had by this time become fairly expert in clairvoyance, clairaudience and
    clairsentience.&nbsp; But it would have been a very dill person indeed who failed to
    recognize the black, billious rage that shook him to the soul.&nbsp; I instance this as a
    proof that Yeats was a genuine&nbsp; poet at heart, for a mere charlatan would have known
    that he had no cause to fear an authentic poet.&nbsp; What hurt him was the knowledge of
    his own incomparable inferiority.</p>
    <p>I was little of him and George Moore.&nbsp; I have always been nauseated by
    pretentiousness; and the Celtic revival, so-called, had all the mincing, posturing
    qualities of the literary Plymouth Brother.&nbsp; They pretended to think it an
    unpardonable crime not to speak Irish, though they could not speak it themselves; and they
    worked in their mealymouthed way towards the galvanization of the political, ethnological
    and literary corpse of the Irish nation.&nbsp; Ireland has been badly treated, we all
    know; but her only salvation lay in forgetting her nonsense.&nbsp; What is the use of
    setting up a scarecrow provincialism, in re-establishing a barbarous and fantastic
    language which is as dead as Gothic and cannot boast sufficient literature to hold the
    attention of any but a few cloistered scholars --- at the price of cutting Ireland off
    from the main stream of civilization?&nbsp; We see already that the country has slunk into
    the slough of anarchy.&nbsp; When the Kilkenny cats have finished shooting each other from
    behind hedges, the depopulated island will necessarily fall into the hands of practical
    colonists, who will be content to dwell peaceably together and communicate with the world
    in a living language.</p>
    <p>Like Byron, Shelly, Swinburne and Tennyson, I left the university without taking a
    degree.&nbsp; It has been better so; I have accepted no honour from her; she has had much
    from me.</p>
    <p>I wanted the spirit of the university and I passed my examinations in order to be able
    to imbibe it without interference from the authorities, but I saw no sense in paying
    fifteen guineas for the privilege of wearing a long black gown more cumbersome than the
    short blue one, and paying thirteen and fourpence instead of six and eightpence if I were
    caught smoking in it.&nbsp; I had no intention of becoming a parson or a schoolmaster; to
    write B.A. after my name would have been a decided waste of ink.</p>
    <p>I felt that my career was already marked out for me.&nbsp; Sir Richard Burton was my
    hero and Eckenstein his modern representative, as far as my external life was concerned.
    &nbsp; A vaccalaureate would not assist me noticeably in the Himalayas or the Sahara.
    &nbsp; As for my literary career, academic distinction would be a positive disgrace.
    &nbsp; And with regard to my spiritual life, which I already felt to be the deepest thing
    in me, the approbation of the faculty was beneath troubling to despise.&nbsp; I have
    always objected to incurring positive</p>
    <p>{166}</p>
    <p>disgrace.&nbsp; I see no sense in violating conventions, still less in breaking laws.
    &nbsp; To do so only gives one unnecessary trouble.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is impossible to make positive progress by means of institutions
    which lead to one becoming a lord chancellor, an archbishop, an admiral, or some other
    flower of futility.&nbsp; I had got from Cambridge what I wanted: the intellectual and
    moral freedom, the spirit of initiative and self-reliance; but perhaps, above all, the
    indefinable tone of the university.&nbsp; The difference between Cambridge and Oxford is
    that the former makes you the equal of anybody alive; the latter leaves you in the
    invidious position of being his superior.</p>
    <p align="center"><em><strong>NOTE ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN<br>
    OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE</strong></em></p>
    <p>One of the most significant points in English character is thrown into relief by the
    contemplation of Oxford and Cambridge.&nbsp; I should be very puzzled to have to say that
    that point is, but the data are unmistakable. The superficial likeness between the
    universities is very clear, yet their fundamental spiritual difference can only be
    described as &quot;a great gulf fixed&quot;.&nbsp; Contrast this with America, where even
    long experience does not enable one to distinguish at a glance between men from the four
    principal universities, or even to detect, in most cases, the influence of any university
    training soever, as we understand the idea.&nbsp; But to mistake an Oxford for a Cambridge
    man is impossible and the converse exceedingly rare.</p>
    <p>I hope it is not altogether the blindness of filial affection that inclines me to
    suggest that the essential difference depends upon the greater freedom of the more famous
    university.&nbsp; Oxford makes a very definite&nbsp; effort to turn out a definite type of
    man and even his ingrained sense that he is not as other men operates finally as a
    limitation.&nbsp; At Cambridge the ambitions and aspirations of any given undergraduate
    are much less clearly cut and are of wider scoÿe than those of his equivalent on the
    Isis. &nbsp; It seems to me no mere accident that Cambridge was able to tolerate Milton,
    Byron, Tennyson and myself without turning a hair, while Oxford inevitably excreted Shelly
    and Swinburne.&nbsp; <em>Per contra</em>, seh suited Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde
    perfectly.&nbsp; Had they been at Cambridge, the nonsense would have been knocked out of
    them.&nbsp; They would have had to succeed or fail entirely on their own virtues; whereas,
    as things were, the Oxford atmosphere and the Oxford manner shielded them from the rude
    blasts of all-round criticism.</p>
    <p>These ideas receive some support from the consideration of the relations normally
    obtaining between undergraduates and dons.&nbsp; On the Granta we are no doubt <em>in
    statu puillari</em>; the Oxonian is <em>in statu quo pupillari</em>. &nbsp; He is taught,
    trained and, if necessary, trounced, to respect the principle of authority.&nbsp; It is
    really fair to say that no Cambridge man would ever dream</p>
    <p>{167}</p>
    <p>of adducing authority in the course of an argument.&nbsp; He might indeed bring forward
    a great name on his side, but never without being ready to support it with the heavy
    artillery of patent proof.&nbsp; No fame is fixed with us as it is with them.&nbsp; The
    spirit of criticism never sleeps.</p>
    <p>We see accordingly much stricter discipline with them than with us. We tend to trust
    the good sense and good will of the fluffiest fresher.&nbsp; Our dons never get nervous
    lest a rag should go too far, and we never betrayed their trust, at least not till quite
    recently.&nbsp; Since my time the tone of both universities has been lowered.&nbsp; Before
    1900 a rag capable of scaring the women students would have been unthinkable.</p>
    <p>Tyranny&nbsp; always trembles, and I remember only too well the wave of sympathy which
    swept through Cambridge at the news that the Oxford authorities, panic-stricken at some
    projected demonstration, had actually imported mounted police from London.&nbsp; Our own
    dons would have cut their throats rather than do anything so disgraceful; but if they had,
    we should have pounded those police into pulp.</p>
    <p>This particular contrast is manifest to both universities.&nbsp; Whenever the subject
    comes up, anecdote answers anecdote to the point.&nbsp; The psychology extends to the
    individual.&nbsp; Our conception of the ideal proctor is very different to theirs.&nbsp; I
    my second year one proctor effected some capture by watching his victim from the darkness
    of a doorway.&nbsp; The story want round and within a week dishonour met its due. &nbsp;
    The dirty dog was ducked in the Cam.&nbsp; Nor were the avengers sent down. &nbsp; On the
    contrary, the proctor was obliged to burn his bands.&nbsp; Such conduct was practically<br>
    unprecedented.</p>
    <p>The typical tale is this.&nbsp; The grounds of Downing College are surrounded by a long
    low wall.&nbsp; One dark windy night a passing proctor saw his cap, caught by a gust, soar
    gracefully over the rampart. His bulldogs climbed the wall and retrieved it.&nbsp; But the
    cap was not their only prize. They dragged with them a most discomfited undergraduate, and
    a companion who was open to criticism from the point of view of the university
    regulations.&nbsp; But the proctor simply thanked the man for bringing back his cap and
    apologized for disturbing him.&nbsp; He refused to take advantage of an<br>
    accident.</p>
    <p>One very instructive incident concerns that brilliant Shakespeare scholar and lecturer
    Louis Umfraville Wilkinson.&nbsp; One summer night he came into college at Oxford a little
    lively with liquor.&nbsp; His with had made the evening memorable and he went on to his
    rooms without curbing his conversation, which happened to deal with the defects of the
    dean in various directions.&nbsp; Fortune favoured him --- I balance the books in
    perspective! --- the dean's window was open and the reprobate heard to his horror that one
    at least of his flock failed to estimate his eminence at the same exalted rate as he did
    himself.&nbsp; He actually brought a formal charge of blasphemy against Wilkinson, pressed
    it to the utmost and succeeded in getting him sent down.</p>
    <p>{168}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilkinson shrugged his shoulders, came over to us and entered
    his name at John's.&nbsp; Now comes an infamy almost incredible.&nbsp; The dean pursued
    his revenge.&nbsp; He wrote a long, bitter, violent letter to Wilkinson's tutor, giving an
    account of the affair at Oxford, and urging --- in such language that it was more like a
    command than a threat --- that Wilkinson be forthwith kicked out of Cambridge.&nbsp; The
    tutor sent for the offender and the following dialogue ensued:</p>
    <p>&quot;I believe you know Mr. So-and-So, Mr. Wilkinson.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I have that honour, sir.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Dean of Blank, Oxford, I understand.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;That is so, sir.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I have a letter from him, which I propose to read to you.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
    <p>The tutor read through the letter, made no comment, asked no questions.&nbsp; He tore
    it slowly in pieces and threw them into the fire.</p>
    <p>&quot;May I hope that you will be with us at breakfast tomorrow?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Good morning, Mr. Wilkinson.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Good morning, sir.&quot;</p>
    <p>I confess that it seems to me that the method of Oxford in such matters errs in two
    different directions.&nbsp; On the one hand, the undergraduate is treated as an
    irresponsible infant, to be dragooned into decency; and on the other, punished with a
    sternness which postulates that he is as accountable for his actions as a fully adult man,
    with comprehensive knowledge of the ways of the world.&nbsp; The result is to hinder his
    development, by withholding experience from him, and at the same time to punish his
    inexperience by making a mere mistake ruinous.&nbsp; The system tends to atrophy his
    ethical develoÿment by insisting on a narrow and inelastic code, while encouraging moral
    cowardice and unfitting him to face the facts which so presumptuously force themselves
    into notice as soon as the college conventions are done with.</p>
    <p>Cambridge realizes that (within very wide limits) the more experience a man has, the
    better is he equipped to make his way in the world.&nbsp; We think it wiser to let men
    find out for themselves what dangers lie ahead, and pay the penalty for imprudence while
    recovery is comparatively easy. Better learn how to fall before the bones become brittle.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of our idea of the relationship between long gowns and short is that,
    even if at the cost of some superficial respect, it is possible to establish more intimate
    communion in a spirit of comradeship between the old and the young. The intellectual gain
    is obvious; but<br>
    perhaps even more valuable is the moral profit.&nbsp; To draw a hard and fast<br>
    line between pupil and teacher limits both.&nbsp; Misunderstanding leads to mistrust,
    mistrust to enmity.&nbsp; It is better to realize the identity of interests.</p>
    <p>{169}</p>
    <p>I became aware of my feeling on this point quite suddenly.&nbsp; The impression is the
    more intense.&nbsp; One night there had been a regular rag.&nbsp; I forget what about, but
    we built a big bonfire in the middle of the market place and otherwise spread ourselves.
    &nbsp; Things began with no definite pulse of passion discernible, but as the evening
    advanced, we found ourselves somehow or other at odds with the townees.&nbsp; I think we
    must have resented their attempt to participate in the general gaiety.&nbsp; Sporadic free
    fights sprang up here and there, but nothing really serious.&nbsp; On the whole we gave
    and took in good temper.&nbsp; Just before twelve o'clock I turned to go home. Just beyond
    the tobacconist's -- Bacon, celebrated by Calverley in his overrated ode --- swirled a
    swarm of townees shouting an swearing in a way that struck me as ugly.&nbsp; It was no
    affair of mine and I did not want to be late.&nbsp; But even as I changed my course to
    avoid the mob I saw that their game was to reinforce half a dozen roughs who were
    surrounding a doorway and hustling one of the proctors.&nbsp; My immediate impulse was to
    gloat upon the evil that had befallen my natural enemy, for until that moment my absurd
    shyness had prevented me from realizing my relations with the authorities.&nbsp; I had
    timidly accepted the conventional chaff, but now almost before that first thought was
    formulated my inmost instincts sprang into consciousness.&nbsp; I shouted to the few
    scattered gownsmen that were still in the square and hurled myself headlong to the rescue
    of my detested tyrant. He was pretty well under the weather, warding off feebly the brutal
    blows that the cowardly cads rained on his face.&nbsp; His cap was gone and his gown was
    in shreds.&nbsp; His bulldogs had been handled still more roughly.&nbsp; I suppose the
    townees saw them as traitors to the cause, hirelings of the aristocracy.&nbsp; They had
    been knocked clean down and were being battered by the boots of the mob.&nbsp; We must
    have been about a dozen, not more, and we had to fight off forty.&nbsp; It was the first
    time that I had ever had to face the animal anger, unreasoned and uncontrolled, of a mass
    of men whose individual intelligences, such as they were, had been for the moment
    completely swamped by the savage instinct to stamp on anything that seemed to them
    sensitive.</p>
    <p>Fate familiarized me with this psychology in another form. It breaks out every time any
    man speaks or acts so as to awaken the frantic fear which is inherent in all but the
    rarest individuals, that anything new is a monstrous menace.&nbsp; For the first time I
    observed the extraordinary fact that in such situations one's time sense runs at two very
    different rates. The part of one's mind that is concerned with one's actions races
    riotously with their rhythm.&nbsp; Another part stands aloof, observing, analysing,
    imperturbable; a train of thought which might, in normal circumstances, occupy an hour
    reduced to a few minutes, and seeming slow at that.</p>
    <p>The roughs were, to all intents and purposes, insane.&nbsp; The neither knew nor cared
    whether they ended by murder.&nbsp; And yet I have no idea why we</p>
    <p>{170}</p>
    <p>mastered them easily enough.&nbsp; We had neither arms nor discipline.&nbsp; We were
    younger, certainly weaker, man for man, and we lacked the force which fury lends to its
    victims.&nbsp; I found myself puzzling it out and the only conclusion was that, whatever
    science may say, there is such a thing as moral superiority, a spiritual strength
    independent of material or calculable conditions.</p>
    <p>The fight went of for twenty minutes or so and ended queerly enough. The mob thinned
    out, melted away at its outskirts, and the front rank men became aware of the fact
    simultaneously without any more reason than had marked their entire proceedings. &nbsp;
    They took to their heels and ran like rabbits.</p>
    <p>I was half-past twelve before I got home.&nbsp; I took a tub and found I was black and
    blue.&nbsp; Of course my breach of the rule about midnight was duly reported.&nbsp; I was
    halled and explained why I had been late.&nbsp; The proctor whom we had conveyed to
    Christ's had not taken our names and I have no reason to think that he knew me.&nbsp; But
    my tutor asked no questions.&nbsp; He took my story for true; in fact, he treated me
    simply as another gentleman. That could not have happened at Oxford.</p>
