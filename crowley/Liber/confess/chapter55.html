    <p>It is probably a rare incident for any young man to meet, in the flesh, the ideal of
    his boyhood's dreams. Such, however was my great good fortune. In the consul at Tengyueh,
    Mr. Litton, I found all that I had lost when Richard Burton died. He possessed the spirit
    of adventure in its noblest and most joyous form. He had the instinct for learning foreign
    languages and dealing with foreign people; and in one respect, his history had been
    similar. Some years before, he had been consul in another part of China which was the
    heart of the Boxer movement. Moving, as he did, among the Chinese in the most intimate
    way, he understood the feeling behind the agitation. He employed his genius in unravelling
    the conspiracy an succeeded in discovering the plans of the Boxers in detail. This
    information he communicated to the authorities in Peking. It will be remembered that
    Burton did exactly the same thing in the matter of the Indian Mutiny; and to a certain
    extent, Sir William Butler had done this with regard to the Boers.</p>
    <p>The result in each case was exactly the same. The indignant authorities banished Litton
    to the remote and unimportant post of Tengyueh, at the very edge of the wildest province
    of China. But it is hard to keep a good man down. Litton's influence over the natives was
    so great that he was the real ruler of the province. He was just starting on tour to
    compose some native squabble near the frontier, some thirty miles from Tengyueh; and we
    lunched together by the wayside. He had done miracles to smooth my path.</p>
    <p>He had been originally alarmed by my taking my wife and child with me on such a
    journey. His letter amused me very much; it showed the class of the English people with
    whom he was expected to deal. He expected us to scream if hot water and cold water was not
    laid on in every Chinese inn, and to take down every Chinese coolie, farmer or merchant
    for a murderer with a special &quot;down&quot; on &quot;foreign devils&quot;. He thought
    the we would be very much upset by that natural curiosity of the natives at seeing a white
    woman and interpret their interest as intentional insult. When he found with what
    practical common sense I travelled, he realized immediately that there was going to be no
    trouble. During this lunch he gave me more genuinely valuable information about China that
    I had had in the whole previous course of my life. One of his sayings was this: whatever
    one hears, however extraordinary, is true in China somewhere or other!</p>
    <p>He also told me the main psychological difference between the Chinese and Indian as
    regards practical dealing with them. The Chinese does not</p>
    <p>{471}</p>
    <p>respect the white man as the Indian does --- for his possession of high moral
    qualities. The very coolies despise their wealthiest merchants for their honesty, which,
    by the way, is unique in commerce. They respect any man who acts as their own mandarins
    act; with absolute lack of sympathy, justice or any other human feelings. They treat the
    traveler well in proportion as he is overbearing, haughty and avaricious.</p>
    <p>I found, in fact, that it was necessary to throw the whole of my previous principles
    overboard. One cannot fraternize with the Chinese of the lower classes; one must treat
    them with absolute contempt and callousness. On the other hand the Chinese gentleman is
    the noblest and courtliest in the world. His general bearing is that of Athos in <em>The
    Three Musketeers</em>, at his best. One's relations with him should be those of absolute
    mutual respect; and here again, intimacy of any kind is impossible. Each man abides on
    pinnacles of isolation. A typical case is the relation of the Emperor to a man like Li
    Hung-chang. The Son of Heaven was so far above even the greatest of his subjects that he
    could make no difference between him and the commonest labourer. He wrote to him simply as
    Li.</p>
    <p>Litton furnished me with careful notes of the stages of my journey to Yunnanfu, which I
    found extremely useful. I could not start from Tengyueh until my passport arrived from the
    consulate general. With extreme kindness, Litton invited me to stay at the consulate until
    it arrived. He himself hoped to be back in Tenjyueh within a week, so that I expected to
    see him again and learn more of his vision. We sat and talked for a couple of hours, each
    feeling instinctively that he had found a sympathetic spirit.</p>
    <p>The march from Bhamo to Tengyueh had been rater eventful. The first day was a pleasant
    ride of about nine miles to Mamouk where we dined at the officers' mess. We were still in
    the Burmese atmosphere and the minds of the people were preoccupied with European affairs
    and disease. There was no trace of the singular horror with which I was to come in contact
    beyond the frontier, a horror from which I found no one but Litton himself entirely free,
    until I got into the sphere of French influence. The next day we covered twenty-one miles
    and the third sixteen, where we camped for the first time in the open. The scenery had not
    been particularly striking; but there was a feeling of openness on leaving the Irrawaddy
    basin which we found extremely pleasant.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day we crossed the Chinese frontier. At this point it is marked by a
    small stream in a ravine. There is not proper bridge; only an insecure-looking tree trunk.
    I had doubts about my pony and decided to walk across. I was of course riding last to
    prevent straggling, and by the time I had crossed the stream the rest of the party were
    out of sight around the corner of the path which rises sharply along the hillside, in
    order to cross the mountain. I had got a little stiff with riding and thought I would
    stretch my</p>
    <p>{472}</p>
    <p>legs; so I walked with my horse up the slope for some distance. Deciding to remount, I
    swung my leg over the saddle; and, before I was seated, the brute put his hind hoof over
    the khud, which was here precipitious. We rolled over each other twice, a distance of
    thirty or forty feet.</p>
    <p>We were neither of us in the least hurt; my feeling was one of plain astonishment. I
    look up at the cliff. It was well within my posers to climb, but there was no possibility
    of getting the pony up. I climbed up the path and carefully retied my turban, which had
    come off, before shouting for Alama to come back and extricate my horse. I felt it
    essential to show myself imperturbable. The men returned to find me quietly sitting and
    smoking. They had considerable difficulty in find a way round for the pony. The day's
    adventures were not yet over. Just before getting to camp I was kicked on the thigh by a
    mule. I shall explain later the extreme importance of this day in my career.</p>
    <p>There was quite a series of small accidents during these days. Salama had started it by
    falling off his mule. Then came my turn. The day after, Rose and the baby fell while
    walking across a bridge, quite incomprehensibly. It was extraordinary luck that they did
    not come to serious grief. The day after, we spent the night in a Buddhist temple after a
    march in the pouring rain, during which the ayah was both kicked and bitten by a mule. The
    day after that it was again my turn to be kicked. I have had a good deal of experience
    with mules in various parts of the world; but only in this short section did such things
    occur.</p>
    <p>This day was again very wet. The road led over a pass three thousand feet high. I say
    &quot;road&quot;, and of course this is the main highway from Burma to China, just as the
    road we had followed from Srinagar is the main highway from Kashmir to Turkestan. In
    neither case would it be considered good going by the average goat. The day we were to
    arrive in Tengyueh, the ayah gave us the slip. We had camped by a hot spring the night
    previous, in company with a caravan bound for Burma. One of the muleteers took the fancy
    of the lady and she decided to throw in her lot with his and go off to Burma. She had been
    such a bad servant and given so much trouble that I made no attempt to retrieve her.</p>
    <p>We met with a warm welcome at the consulate from Litton's Chinese wife, an exceedingly
    beautiful woman with perfect manners. They had five charming children. The prejudice
    against half-castes requires analysis. It is not the mixture of blood, as a rule, that
    makes the majority of them such degraded specimens of humanity, but the circumstances
    usually attending their birth. These circumstances, again, are due to the crass imbecility
    of public morality. When the child is a by-blow of drunken Tommy and a bazaar woman there
    is no need of profound anthropological hypotheses to explain why it is not a Newton or a
    Chesterfield. There is no doubt, however,</p>
    <p>{473}</p>
    <p>that some races make better combinations than others. The best class of Englishman and
    the best class of Chinese mingle admirably, provided (of course) that the children are
    brought up decently in an environment where they are not handicapped from the first by
    feeling themselves objects of dislike and contempt. Nothing is worse for children than to
    be humiliated; they should be brought up to realize that they are &quot;kings and priests
    unto God&quot;.</p>
    <p>The foreign colony at Tengyueh was small and dull. The head of the customs was Napier,
    the son of an old friend of my father's. He was a melancholy aristocrat who only kept
    himself from going insane in these monotonously uncongenial surroundings by a sort of
    Promethean courage. The other Britons have made no impression on my mind soever. There was
    a Norwegian missionary named Amundsen, even more colourless and doleful than brainless
    Scandinavians usually are. The doctor was a Bengali named Ram Lal Sircar, a burly nigger
    of the most loathsome type. I am not fond of Benaglis at the best and he as the worst
    specimen of his race I have ever seen. He was fat and oily, with small piglike treacherous
    eyes. On the rare occasions when he was not eating, he was writing anti-British articles
    for the Bengal native press.</p>
    <p>There was, however, a guest at the consulate with whom I struck up an immediate warm
    friendship. This was a botanist named George Forrest, who was recuperating from an
    adventure which I must narrate in some detail, as it includes one of the most striking
    ghost stories I ever heard. His happy hunting ground had been the Mekong-Salween divide.
    He had been north beyond the twenty-eighth parallel, in country practically untraversed by
    any whites, among mountains which rose to nineteen thousand feet. His headquarters was a
    Jesuit mission.</p>
    <p>The district had been disturbed for some time; a comparatively important town was the
    centre of a small revolt against the Chinese government. An army had been disatched to
    reduce it. The siege was typically Chinese. Having invested the town, the imperial general
    made no attempt to take it by assault; he simply entered into negotiations with the
    garrison as to the price of the surrender. After interminable haggling, a sum was fixed.
    So much is intelligible, but at this point the baffling psychology of the Chinese comes
    into play. The inhabitants were put to the sword and the town sacked, exactly as if it had
    been taken as the result of murderous conflicts.</p>
    <p>The general weakening of the imperial authority led to the outbreak of raids on the
    part of the Buddhist lamas who lived in remote serais perched upon the inaccessible crags
    of the mountains bordering Tibet. Bands of these monks swept down from their fastnesses to
    indulge in orgies of rapine, rape, murder and cannibalism. (The official descriptions of
    the various hells in the Buddhist canon are of course actual pictures of fact; the
    tortures of the damned</p>
    <p>{474}</p>
    <p>are simply slight exaggerations of those actually inflicted by Buddhists on their
    enemies. In particular, it was the custom of these lamas to devour the hearts and livers
    of their enemies in order to acquire their vitality and courage. As I have already
    explained, I do not regard this as superstitious; I think it is practical common sense.)</p>
    <p>Forrest was at the Jesuit mission when word came from the north that the lamas were on
    the war path. It was decided to flee and the entire mission hurried off. Its eldest
    member, Father Bernard, was a man over eighty. It was decided to separate for greater
    safety; but Forrest found it very hard to bring himself to leave the old man, for whom he
    had acquired extreme respect and affection. However, it was the only thing to do, and
    Forrest plunged off alone into an obscure side valley hoping to reach the comparative
    safety of the main road from Tengyueh to Yunnanfu by means of a detour.</p>
    <p>The nightfall of the second day showed him the camp fires of the lamas on the hills to
    the south and he recognized that he was cut off. In the light of the fires he could see
    the gigantic silhouettes of their hounds. He suddenly realized that his European boots
    made it easy to track him, so he discarded them. During the day, the slightest movement
    might easily be observed, or the hounds might be on his track, so he spent it under a rock
    which overhung the river, up to his neck in the icy water. When night fell, he crawled out
    and tried to get some warmth into his body. (His food soon failed him. During this
    adventure he lived for eight days on nothing at all and for the twenty-one following on
    tsampa, Tibetan flour, which has the property of producing violent diarrhoea in the
    average European.)</p>
    <p>Night came on utterly black and Forrest was suddenly aware of a luminous figure
    standing beside him. He recognized it immediately as that of Father Bernard. He thought to
    himself, &quot;They have caught and killed him!&quot; (This was subsequently verified. The
    old man met his end earlier on that day.) The phantom did not speak, but its right arm was
    outstretched as if to urge Forrest to seek refuge in that direction. Forrest laughed to
    himself, despite the atrocious circumstances, at the absurdity; the direction indicated
    was the one of all others which was most certainly fatal to take. After a few minutes the
    figure disappeared. Dawn broke and showed him the situation unchanged. He passed a second
    day in the water under the rock.</p>
    <p>The second night the spectre reappeared. Again he pointed in the same direction and
    this time the gesture was imperious. Forrest's instinct of self-preservation had been
    practically worn out by hardship. &quot;Oh well,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;a quick
    death is better than this,&quot; and off he went in the direction designated. He had not
    gone far before he fell in with a countryman who offered to help him to escape, and led
    him, barefoot as he was, across a snow-covered pass over fifteen thousand feet high. The
    met no lamas and</p>
    <p>{465}</p>
    <p>eventually reached the main road, where Forrest fell in with a caravan of merchants
    travelling to Tengyueh, who treated him well and had him carried to the consulate, where I
    hound him, still weak from his adventure and still shaken in nerve. He told his story with
    the utmost modesty and equanimity; and I could not doubt that the apparition of Father
    Bernard was a fact. That it should have pointed out the way of salvation in the most
    unlikely direction certainly indicated supernormal knowledge.</p>
    <p>The atmosphere at Tengyueh was intensely oppressive. The conversation invariably turned
    upon battle, murder and sudden death, embroidered with fantastic wealth of disease and
    torture. It was an absolute nightmare. I really take great credit to myself for having
    spent twenty-five days in this community without losing my nerve or becoming obsessed.
    Everyone seemed to be preoccupied with the idea that at any moment the Chinese might break
    out and put us all to the most cruel death.</p>
    <p>I must admit that there was a quite unusual number of really terrifying incidents; even
    trifling occurrences seemed too apt to take on a sinister significance. For instance, two
    of Litton's horses died suddenly. I diagnosed anthrax and wanted to take the obvious
    measures; but there was nothing to be done. The servants at the consulate had taken the
    carcasses to the market and spent the next three days in janging for them. To hang is to
    haggle; but the most inveterate haggler is a fixed price merchant in comparison. It was
    certainly the limit to think of the animals being sold for human food! One must be
    resolute to prevent one's mind from dwelling on such subjects; one must take one's
    precautions so far as possible without thinking about the threatened calamity.</p>
    <p>Another disquieting incident was as follows. Tengyueh was supposed to be ion direct
    telegraphic communication with Peking. One of the most absurdly characteristic
    arrangements was that the observatory at Peking telegraphed to us daily the correct time.
    Now at Yunchang there was a relay and, as often as not, the telegraphists would be engaged
    in smoking opium for three or four days at a time. Consequently a whole bunch of telegrams
    would arrive late one evening telling us that it was noon at Peking.</p>
    <p>One was therefore not very sure of getting the news. And just about this time a message
    came though telling us of the riots in Shanghai and that seventeen people had been killed.
    We could not tell how serious this might he; whether it was a local outbreak or whether it
    was part of a general antiforeign rising. I heard later the details. The European colony
    had been badly scared and fortified themselves in the country club; but the riot fizzled
    out. It was none the less alarming to get an isolated item of news of this kind. Thinking
    of it today, I wonder that it never occurred to me to go back to Burma. I did not feel
    either courageous about it or alarmed. There is in me a quality of almost imbecile
    stoicism. I simply cannot be bothered to worry</p>
    <p>{476}</p>
    <p>about danger or hardship of any kind unless it is force on my immediate notice.</p>
    <p>I cannot account for this peculiar imperturbability. It seems entirely at war with my
    extreme sensitiveness. And yet it may indeed be the Freudian protection against this; it
    may be that my instincts warn me that if I allow myself to think at all on certain
    subjects the pain will be unendurable. However that may be, there is no doubt that I
    possess a peculiar solidity; having decided to do anything, I go on my course no matter
    what new facts arise. I will not go a step out of my path of avoid the most obvious
    unpleasantness. And I have certainly never been able to make up my mind whether this
    quality is an advantage in the long run or no.</p>
    <p>The final episode of my story at Tengyueh might indeed have caused most men to change
    their plan. It is in many ways the most dramatic adventure of my life and has left an
    ineradicable impression on my mind. I despair of describing its intensity or the wildness
    of the setting. The oppressively electric atmosphere of the previous three weeks, the
    indescribable apprehension which hung over the colony, suddenly discharged itself in a
    thunderbolt.</p>
    <p>At eight p.m. on January 10th we were sitting at dinner in the consulate when we heard
    confused cries and flying footsteps in the courtyard. The doors were suddenly flung open
    and a gigantic runner dripping with sweat came crashing into the room, sprawling his gaunt
    arms and legs in the extravagance of his gestures. For a moment we believed that an attack
    was imminent but Forrest soon elicited a somewhat vague story to the effect that Litton
    was ill and required the services of a doctor. He was said to be camped at about two days'
    march away in the direction of Bhamo; but we resolved to cover the distance in the course
    of the night. Forrest being my senior, and knowing the language, was evidently marked as
    chief of the expedition. I put myself unreservedly at his orders.</p>
    <p>The first thing was to get the horses, which was easy; the second to rout out the
    Bengali, which was an entirely different proposition. It was after nine o'clock before he
    joined us at the outskirts of the town. The word forward was given, and Forrest and I
    galloped furiously into the darkness. We kept up a tremendous pace as far as the foot of
    the hills. It was a wild and windy night; torn clouds scudded fitfully across a misty
    moon. Some rain had fallen and the broad smooth stones of the road were as slippery as
    glass. It was impossible to ride on the slopes; the tatu stumbled at every step.</p>
    <p>My mountain boots with their wrought iron nails proved equally awkward. I was forced to
    march, supporting myself with one hand on the pony's neck and urging him with my whip with
    the other. We pressed on eagerly through the night; and at last we came to the crest of
    the ridge and began to run down the other side of the path towards the hot springs. There
    was just sufficient light in the east to reveal the landscape by the time we got</p>
    <p>{477}</p>
    <p>near the foot of the hill. Then I saw a litter slowly approaching. Forrest gave a shout
    and dashed enthusiastically forward; but I silently turned my horse, for I saw that the
    consul's legs were tied.</p>
    <p>The situation, apart from its tragic present, was full of anxiety for the future. How
    had Litton died! A glance at the body was not reassuring. There were symptoms which
    suggested poison and the least sinister alternative was some deadly infection. I wanted a
    medical opinion; but the doctor avoided the neightbourhood of the litter, saying that the
    examination could be made at Tengyueh. I did not fully realize what was behind this and
    acquiesced. He hurried back much faster than he had come. For all I knew, he had it in his
    mind to make various preparations.</p>
    <p>About four o'clock we reached a wretched hamlet where some coolies had kindled a fire
    in the street. The bearers of the litter, utterly fagged out, threw themselves down by the
    fire. There was some loose straw lying about and Forrest and I followed their example. We
    tried to learn the circumstances of Litton's death; but the men gave vague and apparently
    contradictory accounts of what had happened. It was awkward; some of them might have been
    in a conspiracy; and we had no means of telling its purport or extent. I snatched a few
    moments of that uneasy slumber which supervenes upon exhaustion and distress, and dulls
    while it does not rest the nerves.</p>
    <p>We started again at about half-past six and reached Tengyueh at about ten o'clock. We
    had allowed the litter to precede us, thinking that the doctor would be in waiting, having
    made all arrangements, but we hound that nothing of the sort had been done. The coolies
    had simply dumped the body in the outer courtyard of the consulate. We hat it taken into
    an empty room on the opposite side of that in which people were living and sent round for
    the doctor. He returned an evasive answer.</p>
    <p>After several further messages, Forrest lost patience and asked me to go round and
    bring him back by force if necessary. It must not be supposed that Forrest was in any way
    hysterical. It was immediately urgent to ascertain the cause of Litton's death. The safety
    of the European community might depend on it. If he had died by violence, our one chance
    might be for troops to be rushed up for our protection; if by disease, to take quarantine
    measures.</p>
    <p>I found the Bengali seated at his table before a plate of rice such as I have never
    seen in my life. There was certainly enough for six average people. I stayed a few moments
    to watch the process of deglutition. It was well worth seeing; and from the debris on the
    table, it was clear that this was merely a little light dessert. I did not lose my temper;
    but I must confess to being very angry. I asked him to come round and he then began to try
    to get out of it altogether. I soon saw hat he had made up his mind that the consul had
    died of some dangerously infectious disease and was solely preoccupied with keeping
    himself out of danger.</p>
    <p>{478}</p>
    <p>Persuasion and reproach failing to reach him, I resorted to the use of my whalebone
    cutting-whip. He made no attempt to ward off the blows, still less to tackle me; he simply
    cowered and howled. I stopped at intervals to impress upon his mind that I intended to go
    on until he came with me to do his duty. He ultimately gave in and I drove him down the
    street to the consulate. But once in the chamber of death, it was still impossible to get
    him to make a proper examination. He would not approach the body. Forrest and I cut off
    the clothes.</p>
    <p>There were some curious wounds caused, in my judgment, by the attempts of some of the
    coolies to relieve the symptoms. They were none of them serious in themselves. The main
    visible symptom was large patches of extravasated blood. The doctor refused point blank to
    make a post-mortem and said he would give his certificate that death was due to
    erysipelas. He then bolted. His next act was to remember that erysipelas was a notifiable
    infectious disease and that therefore his best course was to find my wife and child, and
    endeavour to communicate it if possible. Luckily she had sufficient sense to keep herself
    and the baby out of his way.</p>
    <p>Only one thing was needed to put the lid on. When Forrest and I had done what was
    necessary, we proceeded to disinfect ourselves before rejoining the rest. The missionary
    Amundsen rushed up to us in great excitement and called our attention to an illustrated
    newspaper which he had just received. &quot;Look,&quot; he cried, &quot;there is the
    Norwegian royal family!&quot;</p>
    <p>We buried Litton the following day.</p>
    <p>The next business was to get off. My permission had arrived, but I was told that I must
    engage an interpreter. I should have been only too glad to have one; but I might as well
    have looked for a snowball in hell. Eventually they dug up a person named Johnny White. He
    was the first Chinese with whom I had been in direct permanent connection; and I was
    highly amused to discover that his Chinese name had been Ah Sin. He had been brought up
    from infancy at the Wesleyan Mission at Mandalay. As a servant he had the defect that he
    was continually drunk on arrack and opium. As an interpreter, one, he spoke no Chinese;
    two, he spoke no English. It was with the utmost pain that I was able to communicate with
    him at all. I cross-examined him, of course very severely, as to his religion. It took a
    long time for him to grasp my meaning; but ultimately he reassured me as to his creed,
    which was this: &quot;John Wesley all same God.&quot; He was so besotted with drink and
    drugs that his human qualities, if he ever possessed any, were completely in abeyance. His
    name was soon corrupted into &quot;Janwar&quot; --- which is Hindustani for &quot;wild
    animal&quot;.</p>
    <p>The journey to Yunnanfu was unique in my life in one important respect. I became richer
    as I went along --- by the simple process of spending my money! It was impossible to get a
    change of silver except at one or two</p>
    <p>{479}</p>
    <p>points. I carried the bulk of my money in copper cash. (Everyone knows the coins with
    the square holes.) These furnished loads for two men. I must explain the financial status
    of this part of the world. Silver money had no denomination, but was valued by weight, and
    the &quot;coinage&quot; consisted of lumps of silver, whose purity was guaranteed by its
    shape. The bulkier kind was something like a houseboat, some three inches long and between
    one and two in the other dimensions. The other kind was not unlike a tortoise and its
    surface had a peculiar striation. Thus there were these lumps of silver identified as the
    products of the imperial mint.</p>
    <p>Now, there was a varying relation (rate of exchange) between a certain weight of this
    silver and a string of cash. A string consisted nominally of a hundred cash; but these
    were what was called market cash. A certain number of cash counted as a hundred for all
    commercial purposes and this number varied with the district. Now, as it happened, this
    number was constantly decreased all the way to Yunnanfu, so that if I wished to buy
    something at Tengyuen for a hundred cash I had to hand over a string containing
    eighty-nine coins, whereas a similar transaction at Talifu required only seventy odd, and
    near Yunnansen forty-six if I remember right. I was consequently always having to take off
    coins from my original strings. The number of my strings therefore increased as I went
    along, although I was spending freely. In this way I became continually richer.</p>
    <p>To conclude the financial question. This system broke up suddenly and completely on
    arrival at Yunnansen. Here the French were trying to extend their influence from Tonkin in
    pursuance of which object they had flooded the city with agents who were trying to force
    the French dollar into circulation. Opposed to them were the two old systems; valuing
    sliver by weight, and the tael; and the Mexican dollar, which had hitherto been the
    universal currency of the coast. (The Mexican dollar was itself guaranteed by being
    stamped by the mark or initials of some responsible firm of merchants.) Peking had just
    begun to coin a dollar of its own with the imperial dragon. This is one of the most
    beautiful coins I have ever seen.</p>
    <p>The result of the contention of the currencies was that in Yunnansen one could buy
    things at an absurdly low price, provided that one would pay with the dollars which the
    merchant was being subsidized to accept. &quot;When thieves fall out, honest men come by
    their own.&quot; It is certainly amusing to watch them cutting their own throats in order
    to cut ours more efficiently later on. I only wish we could stop the second part of the
    process.</p>
    <p>We reached Yunchangfu on the fifth day from Tengyueh. Our first march took us up the
    valley of the Shweli, which we crossed on a floating bamboo bridge. The road from there to
    Pingho winds uphill for about five thousand feet. The road was nowhere really bad, but in
    some places so steep that riding was difficult. The third day took us to Lu Chiang Chiao,
    in the valley of the</p>
    <p>{480}</p>
    <p>Salween. The gorge is indescribably sublime. It is sentinelled by magnificent hills of
    splendid and seductive shapes. The air was mild yet fresh. No menace of chill, yet no
    taint of oppression. The road was not steep as on the other side of the watershed and the
    descent afforded a series of superb views.</p>
    <p>The Salween has the reputation of being the most deadly river in the world. Its only
    rivals are in New Guinea and, at an earlier day, the Amazon, the Niger and the Congo. It
    is supposed to have a specially fatal form of malaria which kills most people outright and
    from which on one ever wholly recovers. No doubt, some of the lower reaches are extremely
    pestilential; but in this section one might establish an ideal sanatorium. The course of
    the Salween had not at that time been completely explored. There is not only fever but
    massacre in that romantic ravine. Part of it is inhabited by the Lolos (they are not
    vaudeville artists but tribes) reported to be exceedingly primitive and addicted to head
    hunting, kidney chasing, phallus fishing and testicle trapping, so that their cooks are
    famous for stewed spleen, pancreas puddings and appendix on toast.</p>
    <p>I met a number of these tribesmen; they reminded me very much of some of the wandering
    peoples of Central Asia and various folks of the low country of Mexico; and I was reminded
    of them in turn by many of the nomads of the Sahara. They were very different from the
    Chinese ion costume, manner and appearance. In character, I found them charmingly
    childlike. Of course, it was easy enough to imagine that a tactless traveller might alarm
    them in all sorts of ways without intending to do so, and that they would react as
    naturally and innocently as any other creatures of the wild might do. But they were
    entirely free from the malignant envy, the panic born of prejudice and the perverse
    passions produced by hypocritically pretending to suppress natural instincts, which one
    associates with tradesmen in the West End of London and ministers of religion.</p>
    <p>Litton's idea of a holiday had been to explore the upper reaches of this river. He had
    in fact wanted to reach that very spot which I had myself picked out for my objective,
    where the Salween, Mekong and Yangtze Kiang run parallel to within a space of forty miles,
    while at their mouths the distance between each is two thousand miles instead of twenty.
    At each village Litton was received with the utmost courtesy and goodwill; but when he
    disclosed his intention of proceeding northwards, it created panic. They told him that to
    the north were no men but devils only; accursed races of the pit whose only methods of
    communicating ideas were envenomed arrows, pitfalls and the poisonous fluff of the bamboo
    which acts more subtly than ground glass.</p>
    <p>I thought this story extraordinarily typical of human thought in general. Everyone
    admits that we have reached the summit of wisdom, scaled the</p>
    <p>{481}</p>
    <p>loftiest pinnacles of morality, put the crown of perfection upon the cranium of
    progress, and everyone knows perfectly well how this remarkable result has been achieved.
    But at the first hint that anyone proposes to take a step farther on this road, he is
    universally set down as a lunatic of the most dangerous type. However, the most savage
    Lolos are content with that diagnosis, whereas the most enlightened English add that the
    pioneer is not only a lunatic but a pervert, degenerate, anarchist an the rest of it ---
    whatever terms of abuse chance to be in fashion. The abolition of slavery, humane
    treatment of the insane, the restriction of the death penalty to serious offences, and of
    indiscriminate flogging, the admission of Jews, Catholics, Dissenters and women as
    citizens, the introduction of the use of chloroform and antiseptics, the application of
    stem to travel, and of mechanical principles to such arts as spinning and printing, the
    systematic study of nature, the extension of the term poetry to metres other than the
    heroic, the recognition of painting other than voluptuous coloured photographs as art, and
    of music other than classical melody as art --- these and a thousand similar innovations
    have all been denounced as chimerical, blasphemous, obscene, seditious, anti-social and
    what not.</p>
    <p>We crossed the Salween by means of a bridge ornamented with shrines and a delightful
    and romantically beautiful house for the toll-keeper. Caesar, when he crossed the Rubicon,
    had less aesthetic attractions and less expense. I did not envy him, and as for the
    bridge, it did not seem aware of its responsibilities, which is perhaps the best state of
    mind in which a bridge can be.</p>
    <p>The road was in unexpectedly good condition from the Salween to Pu Pa'o, a long stage
    rendered unpleasant towards the end by threatening rain, which carried out its fell
    designs in the course of the night. For the first time we experienced native curiosity in
    wholesale form. We had been recommended to avoid this by secretiveness. This strange wild
    beast, a white woman, was to be camouflaged in Chinese clothes and bundled out of sight as
    soon as possible.</p>
    <p>I adopted exactly opposite tactics. I said to the people, &quot;Come and see, enlarge
    your minds, increase your experience, take the fullest advantage of this
    opportunity.&quot; They were so accustomed to conventional European cowardice that at
    first they were inclined to be unruly and even suspicious. Can it be a trap? But a few
    minutes convinced them of my absolute faith and friendliness, so that everyone became
    good-temnpered and frank. Their instinct and good manners, which nearly all men outside
    civilization possess, soon told them what conduct was really annoying and offensive; and
    they abstained immediately.</p>
    <p>Europeans too often make up their minds to resent certain actions which are really
    quite harmless and natural. They persuade themselves that everything</p>
    <p>{482}</p>
    <p>which their grandmothers would not do in Sunday School must be resented with the utmost
    rigour. This attitude is the root of at least ninetenths of the trouble about
    &quot;foreign devils&quot;. The only unpleasantness between local natives and alleged
    whites which came under my notice during this journey was when some travelling missionary,
    instead of attending to his own affairs, took it upon himself to insult (in wretchedly and
    comically illiterate Chinese) some villagers who happened to be carrying an idol in
    procession as part of the festivities of New Year's Day (January 25th). He might as well
    have spoiled a children's party on the ground that the fairy stories which amused them
    were not strictly true.</p>
    <p>The action was morally indistinguishable from brawling in church. I may not believe in
    the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius, but I see no reason for inflicting my
    incredulity on the people of Naples. The villagers naturally resented the ill manners of
    this brainless boor and told him to shut up. He immediately began to scream that he was
    being martyred for Christ's sake. I told him that if I could have brought myself to touch
    him, I would have thrashed him within an inch of his life. He did not understand my
    attitude; but I don't suppose there is much in this funny world that he did understand.</p>
    <p>On the twenty-third we came to Yuncangfu. The road during this march was in excellent
    repair. It bordered on a lovely lake, which interested me extremely as having no obvious
    outlet unless through a curious rocky cave; but I could not be sure of this, no current of
    any sort being visible.</p>
    <p>On arrival in the town I was greeted by the Tao Tai, who sent a deputation of
    brilliantly clad and highly dignified servants with presents. These of course I returned
    with the exception of one or two trifles which I retained in order to avoid discourtesy,
    and on my part bestowed goods of European manufacture.</p>
    <p>The next act was an interview with the mandarin in his hall of state where we sat side
    by side, low down, leaving the place of honour for the Son of Heaven and his immediate
    satellites. Having exchanged polite generalities about philosophy and virtue (he seemed to
    think that I was no mean authority on the latter subject) we dealt lightly with more
    mundane topics and proceeded to extricate ourselves from each other's presence in
    accordance with the most elaborate etiquette. He concluded by inviting me to share with
    him the offal which had been rejected by the dogs and kites and I expressed my humble
    rapture at being permitted to partake of the celestial banquet which his heavenly
    hospitality had prepared for the meanest and mouldiest of mankind.</p>
    <p>The mandarin was one of the most beautiful men I have ever seen. I use the word
    beautiful in its strictly aesthetic sense. He was, I judge, between thirty-five and forty
    years old; his features were astonishingly perfect and</p>
    <p>{483}</p>
    <p>their expression full of noble intelligence and lofty benevolence, harmonized by a
    placidity due to a consciousness of his superiority so unbroken and unquestioned that it
    had been absorbed into subconsciousness. He was a miracle of art and that art perfectly
    concealed. His complexion had more than the smoothness of the most exquisite southern
    European types; yet all this impeccability of excellence was not marred, as is too often
    the case with Greek sculpture, but lacking that touch of the bizarre which Goethe
    postulates as essential to supreme beauty. He possessed that peace which I believe is
    intended to inform images of the Buddha, but which nearly always appears as a mere lack of
    any positive passion. The mandarin of Yunchang radiated royalty.</p>
    <p>It was easy to read his history; that he had been exiled to so remote and barbarous a
    city bore witness to the heinousness of the offence which had incurred so severe a
    sentence. On subsequent inquiry I was told that he had been accused of &quot;failing in
    respect towards the imperial swans&quot;. My informant did not say in what his error of
    ritual consisted. (Another rumour, so absurd as to be credible, is that he was not
    criminal at all but insane; that he had the delusion that he was a Fellow ofSt. John's
    College, whether Cambridge or Oxford, I did not learn; and from all accounts it makes
    little difference.) The superb epicureanism of his expression was equally indicative of
    his spiritual superiority to even such blasting disaster as the wrath of the emperor and
    his divine mother.</p>
    <p>The banquet was worthy of the man. Beginning at high noon, it ended only when Kephra
    the Beetle passed through the pylon of midnight; and during thee twelve hours, there was
    no intermission in the arrival of new dishes and entertainments. The opulence of
    Trimalchio was concealed beneath the refinement of Lucullus and the culture of Horace.</p>
    <p>Of late years Chinese cooking has become popular, though not nearly as popular as it
    deserves to be, in New York, Paris and London. In new York it is the best food; in
    Amurrka, outside New York, it is the only food (bar sea-food) fit for human consumption
    save in the Indian Grill Room in Los Angeles, Chez Antoine in New Orleans, and one or two
    other remote oases in the wilderness of canned abominations. In London, the vulgarity of
    the idea of a square meal has destroyed oriental delicacy; in Paris the refinement of
    French epicureanism combines with the charm of China.</p>
    <p>But nowhere in Europe or America is the Chinese cook able to convey the essence of his
    excellence. One can no more understand a Chinese dish in Europe than one can enjoy an
    Egyptian cigarette. As to cross running water destroys the enchantment of witches, or to
    traverse black seas destroys the cast of the Brahmin, so the flavour of Chinese food is
    bounded by the Great Wall. I well understand why the exiled Mongol feels that the cannot
    rest in peace in any other than the sacred soil. The dishes too which one obtains at</p>
    <p>{484}</p>
    <p>Beem Nom Low's or at the Taverne Pascal are not those esoteric --- shall we say
    Eleusinian? --- ectasies which intepret the soul of the Wonderland of Flowers.</p>
    <p>I may mention a condiment composed exclusively of rose petals from which, by a subtle
    process, all those elements which are capable of nourishing the human body have been
    abstracted. But for the most part I dare not even describe some of the dainties which make
    Yunchang, to this day, a fragrant memory in my mind. To do so would be to draw a culinary
    parallel with <em>Le Jardin des Supplices</em>. Not that the book is the real China; it is
    rather a wish phantasm of China by the delirium of a degenerate.</p>
    <p>Yunchang is noted for its temples. In one of those is a superb delineation of some of
    the Buddhist hells, where the penalties for various vices are depicted with what is
    sometimes very startling realism. I was sorry not to have been able to stay longer in this
    perfumed paradise of beauty and pleasure, where every element of art and nature were
    harmoniously woven as if endeavouring to echo the melody of the personality of the
    mandarin.</p>
    <p>The next day took us over superbly swelling hills upon whose bosom slumbered a lake.
    Here once more I was mystified as to its outlet. At the end of a delicious day we slept in
    a temple. It was the first day of the year and everyone but the missionary was rejoicing.
    Crackers clustered on long poles of bamboo and gay ornaments of coloured paper were the
    principal offerings to the eye, while the ear was delighted with all kinds of instrumental
    and vocal music. Strange delicate cakes and comfits tempted the tongue, while faint
    perfumes stirred the nostrils. The breeze was sweet with burning sandalwood and subtle
    with the sweat of dainty dancers. Even the sense of touch vibrated with virile joy as
    one's nerves trembled beneath the beatitude of innocent people swarming on every side.</p>
    <p>I have noted about this day's march, &quot;Roads everywhere good.&quot;
    &quot;Good&quot; is a relative term. The Chinese have a proverb that a road is good for
    ten years and bad for ten thousand; most of the particular road I estimated at not less
    than eight thousand. I actually proposed to being home one bit of it; if the weight had
    not been prohibitive, it would have been well worthwhile. This was a slab of granite about
    fifteen feet long, three broad and three thick, and holes had been bored completely
    through it by the hoofs of the pack animals, so that the mud was visible clean through the
    stone.</p>
