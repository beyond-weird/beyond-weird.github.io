    <p>I must give an instance or two of the astounding character of my memory. It is
    absolutely first rate wherever my true interests are concerned, and also first rate in a
    very different sense, in elimination other things so as not to overload the mind. But ---</p>
    <p>I think it was on returning to Boleskine from Paris after taking the Grade of 5° = 6ø
    that I asked Eckenstein to join me for the <em>ski-läufing</em> and salmon. We left
    London together in a sleeper. I had one hundred and fifty pounds in bank notes in my
    pocket book, which I put under my pillow. In the morning I dressed hurriedly, still half
    asleep, and left the book behind. I discovered the loss a few minutes later and shrugged
    my shoulders. I have always had a conviction that it is utterly useless to look for
    anything that has once been lost. I made up my mind immediately to forget about it; I take
    it as a matter of fact that anyone who has found anything would steal it; yet equally as a
    matter of course that it would be returned to me by the finder as simply as one would hand
    a lady the fan she had dropped, with no question of honesty or reward. But Eckenstein
    insisted on my going back to the station immediately. We saw the station master and got
    permission to walk up the tracks --- quite a long distance, hardly less than a quarter of
    a mile --- to the siding where the sleeper had been shunted. The pocket book was found
    intact under my pillow.</p>
    <p>Some time in 1913 or '14 Eckenstein referred to this incident and immediately noticed
    that I did not catch on. He tackled me pointedly; and I denied all knowledge of the affair
    with the emphasis of St. Peter! Eckenstein repeated the facts given in the above paragraph
    and as he did so the whole thing cam back to me. But I would certainly have gone into the
    witness-box and sworn point blank that no such thing had ever happened. Every detail was
    and is perfect in my memory. At this moment I can see the car, the siding, the general
    appearance of the maze of lines, the lowering grey weather, the tumbled bed, the cleaner
    who had just begun his work. I remember thrusting my hand under the pillow and the exact
    state of emotion at finding the book, relief mingled with mild surprise and a strong sense
    of shame at having made such a fool of myself in the presence of Eckenstein.</p>
    <p>But the entire packet had been sealed up and stowed away at the back of the safe, in
    accordance with the routine of the office never to allow the mind to feed upon thoughts
    connected with money. I know that this seems farfetched and many people will find it
    entirely unintelligible; but it is the fact.</p>
    <p>{352}</p>
    <p>The ultimate secret of my life is that I really live up to my principles. I decide that
    it is disgraceful to allow financial considerations to dictate my conduct; but instead of
    allowing this to remain a pious opinion, I am at pains to invent a regular technique for
    dismissing them.</p>
    <p>Another incident. In returning to Zapotlan we had ridden a hundred and twenty miles in
    the broiling sun. I had outridden O.E., who was amazed and irritated at my power to endure
    heat and thirst. I became alarmed when I found he was nowhere to be seen and rode back a
    good many miles, managing (as luck would have it) to miss him in one small patch of
    woodland which diversified the desert. When I reached Zapotlan I had to be lifted off my
    horse. We were to start the next morning, as we were in rather a hurry to get back to
    Mexico City.</p>
    <p>I woke before six o'clock and found the whole place in darkness. I opened the big
    gateway, fed the horses, saddled them and then, finding that nobody was stirring, thought
    I would lie down on my bed for a minute or so till breakfast was ready. I went to sleep.
    Eckenstein had some difficulty in arousing me.</p>
    <p>The point of the story is this: that I had done nothing of the sort. Eckenstein proved
    to me (and a difficult task he had) that I had never wakened at all and that the whole of
    my early morning's activities were a mere wish phantasm; being too sleepy to do my duty, I
    dreamt that I had done so.</p>
    <p>This last incident is very typical. Not once nor twice in my fair island story have I
    hound myself in honest doubt which, believe me, is worth half the creeds, as to whether
    any given incident took place in sleep or waking. It may be thought that my accounts of
    various magical incidents are under suspicion; but being aware of my peculiarities, I have
    naturally been at great pains to eliminate any such source of error. Eckenstein's proof
    that I was dreaming depended on the physical evidence of the closed doorway and the
    unsaddled horses. It is of course easy to reply that I may have been asleep the second
    time as well as the first! And of course there is no answer to that any more than there is
    to the argument that we are all part of the Red King's Dram, as Lewis Carroll puts the
    fable of Kwang-Tze. (Kwang-Tze once said to his disciples on awakening: &quot;Just now I
    was dreaming that I was a butterfly: but is it so, or am I a butterfly dreaming that it is
    Kwang-Tze?&quot;)</p>
    <p>To return to the wicked city of Paris. J.W.Morrice, as a painter, does not possess the
    sternly intense passion of O'Conor. His vision lacks the blazing brilliance of beauties
    which imposes itself on the beholder in O'Conor's best work. Morrice is a <em>homo unius
    tabulae</em>. He has only seen one thing in his life --- it is the rosy dream which Venus
    and Bacchus bestow upon their favourites. His pictures swim in a mist of rich soft
    delicate colour which heightens the effect of the character of his draughtsmanship; and
    that suggests the same qualities by means of a different system of hieroglyphics.</p>
    <p>{353}</p>
    <p>The most prominent member of the Chat Blanc symposia, after these, was Paul Bartlett. I
    found him brilliant and good natured; and his caustic speech gave a spice to his
    geniality. I thought very highly of his work; but he might have gone much further had it
    not been for the social and artistic success which acts as a soporific on all artists
    whose vigilance is unequal to the strain. It is hard indeed for the strongest of us to be
    ungracious to our admirers. Neglect and poverty, moreover, injure a man's art if they
    continue for more than a certain number of years. It is best for a man if he begins to
    taste success in the early forties; but he must have begun with &quot;the
    thwackings&quot;, as Meredith so profoundly sets forth in that superb magical apologue, <em>The
    Shaving of Shagpat</em>; and he should have learnt their lesson that the applause of
    mankind is as contemptible as its abuse. &quot;Just so many asinine hee-haws&quot;, as
    Browning said. The artist must live continually in such intense intimacy with the God-head
    that he is not to be disturbed either by starvation or success.</p>
    <p>There were of course a number of fleas on the Chat Blanc; men whose association with
    art was a sort of superstition, men who bored us and yet were as difficult to get rid of
    as the lumber that accumulates in a house. But sometimes a stranger would introduce a new
    note of genuine amusement.</p>
    <p>One day one of the Americans introduced the &quot;great American artist, Penrhyn
    Stanlaws&quot;. His name was Stanley Adamson and his birthplace Dundee. He had begun his
    life in the traditional manner of the great by holding horses' heads and earning dimes.
    Somehow or other, while quite a youth, he had sprung into popular favour and was already
    earning two thousand pounds a year or more by dashing off a succession of spidery scrawls
    representing fluffy American flappers in various attitudes. He had come to Paris to study
    art seriously.</p>
    <p>I was delighted with him. He was Pinkerton of <em>The Wrecker</em>, with every <em>t</em>
    crossed and every <em>i</em> dotted. His innocent earnestness, without any root to it, his
    infatuation for &quot;uplift&quot;, his total ignorance of the morality of the artist, his
    crude prejudices based upon Sunday School, his attitude to everything assumed in blissful
    unconsciousness of a background: this was all perfectly charming. He had all the
    fascination of a new penny toy.</p>
    <p>Now, at this time, Gerald Kelly was in his Whistler-Velasquez period. Kelly's mind is
    in no way creative or even critical in the true sense of the word. He was a scholar. He
    would convince himself by elaborate argument that So-and-so was the greatest of all
    artists; and he would then endeavour to discover the secrets of the master in the spirit
    of the analytical chemist, and proceed to paint with the most pitiful perseverance in the
    style of his latest hero. I possess sketches by Kelly which I defy the world to
    distinguish from Beardsley, Rossetti, Morris, G.F.Watts, etc. Robbie Ross once told me of
    a man who collected fans by Charles Conder. He had twenty-three when he</p>
    <p>{354}</p>
    <p>died; four of them Conders, five doubtful, but the remaining fourteen genuine Kellys.</p>
    <p>At this particular moment he was aiming at the &quot;low tone&quot; of Whistler and
    Velasquez and his method was to keep on darkening his palette. Ultimately he would use
    paint the colour of Thames mud for the highlight on the cheek of a blonde. He once picked
    out an old canvas to paint over and had gone some distance before he discovered that it
    was his favourite portrait of the Hon. Eileen Grey. His knowledge of art was
    encyclopaedic; and he laid down the law and more unction and emphasis than anyone else I
    have every heard. He took Stanlaws under his wing and started to teach him to paint.</p>
    <p>Stanlaws possessed the characteristic American faculty of doing anything and everything
    easily; of scoring superficial success. One day I called on him and found a large easel in
    his studio on which stood a vast canvas --- evidently by Kelly. I congratulated him on his
    acquisition. He replied, rather huffily, that he had painted it himself. And the cream of
    the jest is that this hasty imitation of Kelly's imitations of Velasquez was accepted in
    the Salon on the strength of Stanlaws' American reputation!</p>
    <p>I gradually sickened of the atmosphere of Paris. It was all too easy. I flitted
    restlessly to London and back, and found no rest for the sole of my foot. I had even got
    engaged to be married, but returning after a week in London I was partly too shy to resume
    relations with my fianc&#130;e, and partly awake to the fact that we had drifted under the
    lee shore of matrimony out of sheer lack of moral energy. This lady claims notice
    principally as the model for several poems, notably (in <em>Rosa Mundi, and other Love
    Songs</em>) &quot;The Kiss&quot;, &quot;Eileen&quot; and the poems numbered 14, 15, 16,
    18, 21 to 28. She was also the &quot;Star&quot; in <em>The Star and the Garter</em>, Which
    I wrote at this time; and the three women connected with the &quot;Garter&quot; were an
    English lady with a passion for either, an acrobat and model whom I called my boot-button
    girl because her face was &quot;round and hard and small and pretty&quot;, and thirdly
    Nina Olivier. Nina is described in the poem itself and also in several lyrics, notably
    &quot;The Rondel&quot; --- &quot;You laughing little light of wickedness&quot;. My
    adoration of Nina made her the most famous girl in the quarter for a dozen years and more.
    She figures, by the way, in my &quot;Ordeal of Ida
    Pendragon</a>&quot;.</p>
    <p><em>The Star and the Garter</em> contains some of my best lyrics and is also important
    as marking a new step in my poetic path. I had mastered form better than I had ever done
    before; I had welded lyrics into a continuous opus with an integral purpose, without
    artificiality, such as to some extent mars <em>Orpheus</em> and even <em>Alice</em>. I
    spent two days writing the poem; but I do not consider it a waste of time.</p>
    <p>Some time later I added an appendix of a very obscure kind. The people of our circle,
    from Kathleen Bruce (since Lady Scott and Mrs. Hilton Young)</p>
    <p>{335}</p>
    <p>to Sybil Muggins and Hener-Skene (later, accompanist to Isadora Duncan) are satirized.
    Their names are introduced by means of puns or allusions and every line is loaded with
    cryptic criticism. Gerald and I, as educated men, were frightfully fed up with the
    presumption and poses of the average ass --- male or female --- of the quarter.</p>
    <p>One incident became immortal. One incident became immortal. I wrote in <em>The Sword of
    Song</em> that I &quot;read Lévi and the Cryptic Coptic&quot;, and lent the manuscript to
    my financ&#130;e, who was sitting for Gerald Kelly. During the pose she asked him what
    Coptic meant. &quot;The language spoken by the ancient Copts,&quot; replied Kelly and
    redoubled his aesthetic ardours. A long pause --- then she asked, &quot;What does cryptic
    mean?&quot; &quot;The language spoken by the ancient Crypts,&quot; roared the <em>rapin</em>
    and abandoned hope of humanity.</p>
    <p>Another affectation of the women art students was to claim to be treated exactly as if
    they were men in every respect. Gerald, always eager to oblige, addressed one of his
    models as old fellow, to her great satisfaction. Then he excused himself for a momentary
    absence in the terms which he would have used to another man. On his return, the lady had
    recovered her &quot;sex and character&quot;, and had bolted. Woman can only mix with men
    on equal terms when adopts his morality lock, stock and barrel, and ceases to set an
    extravagant artificial value on her animal functions. The most high-principled woman
    (alleged) insists on the supreme value of an asset which is notoriously of no value
    whatever in itself.</p>
    <p><em>The Star and the Garter</em> deals frankly with this problem, among others. As far
    as sexual charm is concerned, it is only reasonable to expect the expert to be more
    satisfactory than the new chum; and even, class for class, the professional than the
    amateur. The desire for exclusive possession is one of the most idiotic and bestial pieces
    of vanity in human psychology. But love can exist between man and woman entirely
    independent of any sexual relations between them. The condition of this love is that both
    parties should have completely mastered their sexual natures; for otherwise their mutual
    relations are not free to love decently until they have analysed themselves completely and
    swept away ever\ trace of mystery from sex; and this means the acquisition of a profound
    philosophical theory based on wide reading of anthropology and enlightened practice.</p>
    <p>My travels had doubtless done much to open my eyes. I had already studied the
    characteristics of fifty-seven separate races, a number which I subsequently increased to
    eighty or ninety, when it became difficult to define the word &quot;race&quot;. My
    ethnological results are not particularly striking; but the course of the research
    certainly helped to make it clear that no proposition could be judged as right or wrong,
    or even as true or false. It is always possible to derive a point of view from the
    circumstances of its holder.</p>
    <p>{356}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of Khatmandu,<br>
        And the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Every conceivable moral principle is held somewhere by somebody; and it is the
    ineluctable conclusion from that somebody's premisses. His circumstances are unique; and
    so are his hereditary tendencies, his environment, his training and the character of his
    mental processes. Whether we hold free will or determinism, we equally ratify every type
    of opinion and conduct.</p>
    <p>I had not at this time consciously reached this freedom. I was still a romantic, still
    seeking true love. Observe a curious analogy to the time when I invoked the adepts, and
    one actually by my side; so now, invoking true love, there lurked unsuspected in my circle
    the woman destined to satisfy my aspirations; and just as in aspiring to the Path of the
    Wise I had not realized the nature of that Path, so also I did not understand what the
    words true love might mean.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>True love with black inchauntments filled,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>Its hellish rout of shrieks and groans,<br>
          Its vials of poison death-distilled,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>Its rattling chains and skeletons.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I made comparatively few notes of this period --- November 1902 to April 1903. It seems
    rather strange that I should have been able to get such an epitome of life into so short a
    period; at least I reached old age. I went back to Boleskine almost as a ghost might
    retire to his tomb at cock-crow. In May I wrote a very clear r&#130;sum&#130; of my
    progress. It will be as well to quote it.</p>
    <p>In the year 1899 I came to Boleskine House and put everything in order with the object
    of carrying out the Operation of Abra-Melin the Mage.</p>
    <p>I had studied Ceremonial Magick and had obtained remarkable success.</p>
    <p>My gods were those of Egypt, interpreted on lines closely akin to those of Greece.</p>
    <p>In philosophy I was a realist of the Cabbalistic school.</p>
    <p>In 1900 I left England for Mexico, and later the Far East, Ceylon, India, Burma,
    Baltistan, Egypt and France. It is idle there to detail the corresponding progress of my
    thought; and passing through a stage of Hinduism, I had discarded all deities as
    unimportant, and in philosophy was an uncompromising nominalist. I had arrived at what I
    may describe as the position of an orthodox Buddhist; but with the following reservations.</p>
    <p>1. I cannot deny that certain phenomena do accompany the use of</p>
    <p>{357}</p>
    <p>certain rituals; I only deny the usefulness of such methods to the White Adept.</p>
    <p>2. I consider Hindu methods of meditation as possibly useful to the beginner and should
    not therefore recommend them to be discarded at once.</p>
    <p>With regard to my advancement, the redemption of the cosmos, etc. etc. I leave for ever
    the &quot;Blossom and Fruit&quot; theory and appear in the character of an inquirer on
    strictly scientific lines.</p>
    <p>This is unhappily calculated to damp the enthusiasm; but as I so carefully of old, for
    the Magical Path, excluded from my life all other interests, that life has now no
    particular meaning; and the path of Research, on the only lines I can now approve of,
    remains the one Path possible for me to tread.</p>
    <p>(By the Blossom and Fruit theory, I mean the existence of a body of initiates pledged
    to devote themselves to the redemption of mankind.)</p>
    <p>It sounds as if I had become a bit of a prig. I expect a good deal of my attitude was
    due to exhausted vitality. Chogo Ri was perhaps still taking his revenge.</p>
    <p>I had picked out Boleskine for its loneliness. Lord Lovat and Mrs. Fraser-Tyler, my
    nearest neighbours, were eight miles away, while Grant of Glenmoriston was on the other
    side of Loch Ness. Besides, Boleskine was already the centre of a thousand legends.</p>
    <p>Even before I came there there was a fine crop of the regular Highland superstitions.</p>

    </center></div><p>I certainly used to hear the &quot;rolling of the head&quot;, but when I
    put in a billiard table, the old gentleman preferred it to the corridor and confined his
    amusements to the gunroom. Even before that, he had always stopped at the Pylon of the
    corridor which marked off from the rest of the house the wing which was consecrated to
    Abra-Melin. I have never discovered any explanation of these noises. We used to listen at
    the door of the gun room, and the bead would roll merrily up and down the table with
    untiring energy. The moment we opened the door the noise would stop; but there would be no
    visible cause.</p>
    <p>During my absence, the reputation of the house had become more formidable than ever
    before. I have little doubt that the Abra-Melin devils, whatever they are, use the place
    as convenient headquarters and put in some of their spare time in terrifying the natives.
    No one would pass the house after dark. Folk got into the habit of going round through
    Strath Errick, a detour of several miles. There were a great many definite legends; but I
    made rather a point of refraining from making a collection. I was completely committed to
    rationalism and the occurrence of miracles was a nuisance. I should have like to deny the
    reality of the whole Abra-Melin business, but the phenomena were just as patent as the
    stones of the house.</p>
    <p>I lived the life of the ordinary Scottish laird in a dull mechanical way and drifted
    into beginning meditation on Buddhist lines; rather because I had nothing better to do
    than for any more positive reason. The record of the period from June 16th to July 13th is
    curiously dull. One notices chiefly the lack of driving force and the complete
    disappearance of any enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>I had completed <em>The Sword of song</em> before I left Paris and left it to be
    printed with Philippe Renouard, one of the best men in Paris. I intended to issue it
    privately. I had no longer any ideas about the &quot;best publisher&quot;. I felt in a
    dull way that it was a sort of duty to make my work accessible to humanity; but I had no
    idea of reaping profit or fame thereby.</p>
