    <p>After about a week in Srinagar, I accepted an invitation to stay with Radcliffe at his
    headquarters in Baramula, to go shooting. I travelled by dunga in order to see a little
    more of native life and character, which I was able to do more freely now that my
    responsibility of the expedition was at an end. I passed two wonderful days of perfect joy
    on river and lake. I realized the whole of Kubla Khan, including the parts that Coleridge
    forgot. I understood the exclamation of the Persian poet:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>If on earth is a heaven of bliss,<br>
            It is this, it is this, it is this.</p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Radcliffe and I went shooting bears occasionally, but I could not get up much
    enthusiasm. I was still suffering from occasional bouts of fever; and besides, was
    oppressed with a certain lassitude. I felt admirably well, but disinclined for necessary
    exertion. The strain of the journey was making itself felt. I wanted to lounge about and
    indulge in short strolls in the shade, to eat and drink at my ease, and to sleep
    &quot;lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily, in the noonday sun&quot;. I had arranged to go
    on a more serious expedition with Radcliffe; but he was called away by a telegram, and I
    decided to wander slowly back to Blighty.</p>
    <p>I left Baramula on September 21st, reached Pindi on the twenty-fourth, and after a day
    or two in Delhi and Ajmer reached Bombay on the last day of the month. I had meant to
    investigate Jaipur and the abandoned city which was deserted in the heyday of its
    splendour at an hour's notice on the advice of an astrologer. (He prophesied, observe,
    that it would become like &quot;the courts where Jamshyd glorified and drank deep&quot;,
    and so it did!) But my power to feel had been definitely dulled by the expedition.
    Hardship and sickness had temporarily exhausted my vitality.</p>
    <p>A queer token of this and the only one. My beard was at this time a mixture of red and
    black in almost equal proportions. I shaved to go to Europe; and when I let it grow again,
    all the red hairs had become perfectly white.</p>
    <p>I left Bombay on the fourth of October, by the poor old <em>Egypt</em> wrecked off
    Ushant in 1922. On the boat was a young officer returning to England on leave, to get
    married. It was a romantic story, and for the satisfactory accomplishment of his plan a
    plain gold ring which he wore on the fourth finger of his left hand was of the last
    importance. He removed it from his finger to read the inscription on the inside. Just as
    he put it back, a passing</p>
    <p>{332}</p>
    <p>steward touched his elbow and the ring fell to the deck. It would have gone quite
    safely into the scuppers, but the owner and the steward, stooping excitedly to retrieve it
    collided. One of them snatched the ring; it slipped from his fingers and went overboard.
    The young man's distress was pitiful to see. &quot;I daren't face her without it,&quot; he
    kept on moaning, with the tears streaming down his face. We did the best we could by
    drawing up a signed statement explaining how the accident occurred.</p>
    <p>We forgot all about the matter in the course of the voyage, and when we arrived at Aden
    even the youth himself had recovered his spirits. To pass the time, we proposed fishing
    for sharks in the harbour and after about an hour we got a fine fish aboard. It was
    immediately cut up; but search as we would we could find no trace of the ring.</p>
    <p>I reached Aden on the ninth. It must be a perfectly ghastly place to live in. As I was
    to land in Egypt, I had to be quarantined for a day at Moses' Wells, regulation being that
    one must be eleven days out from Bombay, in case of plague. Moses' Wells is the most
    hateful place I have ever been in, with the possible exception of Gibraltar. I note in my
    diary that the food was &quot;beastly, and abominable, and absurdly dear&quot;. If I
    remember correctly, it was cooked by a Greek and served by an Armenian. Volumes could not
    say more.</p>
    <p>I arrived in Cairo on the fourteenth and was transported to the seventh heaven. I lived
    at Shephard's Hotel till Guy Fawkes's Day, wallowing in the flesh pots. I would not even
    go out to see the Pyramids. I wasn't going to have forty centuries look down on me.
    Confound their impudence! I could not even bother to study Islam from the religious point
    of view, but I undertook a course in ethnology which remains in my mind as the one study
    where the roses have no thorns. I got a typist and dictated an account of my various
    wanderings in my better moments, but most of the time I was earnestly pursuing my
    researches in the fish market.</p>
    <p>My mind began, moreover, to flow back into its accustomed channels. For one thing, I
    came to the conclusion that &quot;the most permanent poetry is perhaps love songs for real
    country folk --- about trout and love.&quot; And I began to write a set of lyrics to be
    called &quot;The Lover's Alphabet&quot;. This was to consist of twenty-six poems,
    associating a girl's name with a flower with the same initial from A to Z. One of my
    regular pedantic absurdities! Needless to say, it broke down. The debris is printed in my <em>Collected
    Works</em>, Vol. III, pp. 58 seq. I was also vaguely revising <em>Orpheus</em> and the
    other literary lumber of the past year and a half.</p>
    <p>I had been doing a certain amount of practical Magick off and on, even during the
    expedition; but this too had dropped off since my return to civilization. As to Yoga, I
    was still completely dead. I had become dull to the trance of sorrow itself. I had no
    doubts as to the efficacy of Magick or the advantages of Mysticism. I simply couldn't be
    bothered with them. I was not</p>
    <p>{333}</p>
    <p>under any illusions about the value of worldly pleasures; it was simply that I did not
    possess the energy to live any other kind of life.</p>
    <p>I cannot understand why people imagine that those who retire from the world are lazy.
    It is far easier to swim with the stream, to refresh one's mind continually by letting it
    move from one distraction to another. This is so true that one might almost assert that
    the idlest monks are in reality more energetic than the busiest business man. This does
    not apply so much to Catholic monks, for their routine exercises dull the edge of whatever
    minds they possess; and not at all to missionaries, who live bourgeois lives diversified
    by pleasurable outbursts of vanity. But it applies to the orientals, from Japan to
    Morocco.</p>
    <p>One might go further and say that, apart from religion altogether, the oriental lives a
    much more intense mental life than Europeans or Americans; that is, provided it has been
    aroused from brutish stupor by education. For the Western uses his education to take the
    edge off his mind. He allows it to wander among business and family details, and putrefies
    it by reading newspapers. In the East, an active mind cannot go sprawling over the
    shallows. It is compelled by its relatively limited intellectual furniture to cut itself a
    constantly deepening course. Thus it occurs that very few people indeed, outside Asia and
    Africa, are aware of the existence of any of the higher states of mind. The imagine that
    consciousness connotes a single level of sanity; that is, that is consists in the
    mechanical movement of its elements in repose to the varied stimuli of the senses. There
    is a tendency to regard even such comparatively slight variation as the reflective habit
    of the man of science and the philosopher as being abnormal and in a sense unhealthy. They
    are the subjects of vulgar ridicule.</p>
    <p>In sheer spiritual lassitude, I left Egypt homeward bound. During my absence from
    England I had kept up a sort of irregular correspondence with Gerald Kelly, who had by
    this time started to try to learn to paint, and who had a studio in the rue Campagne
    Première in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris. I gladly accepted his invitation to stay
    with him there. It had already been branded on my forehead that I was the Spirit of
    solitude, the Wanderer of the Waste, Alastor; for while I entered with absolutely
    spontaneous enthusiasm into the artistic atmosphere of Paris, I was always subconsciously
    aware that here I had no continuing city.</p>
    <p>I( began to pick out the old threads of my life. Despite the evidence of Allan Bennett
    as to the integrity of Mathers, the premisses of my original syllogism as to his authority
    were not impaired. His original achievements proved beyond doubt that he had been at one
    time the representative of the Secret Chiefs; that he had either been temporarily obsessed
    or had permanently fallen.</p>
    <p>On leaving for Mexico, I had asked him to take care of a dressingcase, a</p>
    <p>{334}</p>
    <p>bag and a few valuable books which I did not want to be bothered with. I called on him
    and asked for their return. I was received as in good standing, yet a certain constraint
    and embarrassment were apparent. He handed over my books, but explained that as he was
    just moving into a new house on the Butte Montmartre (where I found him in the appropriate
    turmoil), he could not lay his hands on my bags for a few days. I have never seen them
    since. One of them was an almost new fifty-guinea dressing-case.</p>
    <p>I drew my own conclusions. What had happened to me was so much like what had happened
    to so many other people. But I still saw no reason for throwing over my allegiance. The
    best policy was to remain inactive; such as Mathers was, he was the only authority in the
    Order until definitely superseded by the Secret Chiefs.</p>
    <p>I had, however, little doubt that he had fallen through rashly invoking the forces of <em>The
    book of the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin the Mage</em>. I thought I would try the testimony
    of an independent observer. Among the English colony of Montparnasse was a youth named
    Haweis, son of the once celebrated H. R. Haweis of <em>Music and Morals</em>. He had been
    to Peterhouse and was now studying art, in which he has since achieved a certain delicate
    eminence. He went to see Mathers and came back very bored with a pompous disquisition on
    the ancient gods of Mexico. The charlatan was apparent; Mathers had got his information
    from the very people who had induced me to go out to Mexico. He was exploiting <em>omne
    ignotum pro magnifico</em> like the veriest quack. At this moment I came into magical
    contact with his forces. The story has been told admirably, if somewhat floridly, by
    Captain (now Major-General) J.F.C.Fuller. I can hardly do better than quote his account.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Gerald Kelly showed considerable perturbation of mind, and on being asked by Frater P.
      what was exercising him, Gerald Kelly replied, &quot;Come and free Miss Q. from the wiles
      of Mrs. M.&quot; Being asked who Mrs. M. was, Gerald Kelly answered that she was a vampire
      and a sorceress who was modelling a sphinx with the intention of one day endowing it with
      life so that it might carry out her evil wishes; and that her victim was Miss Q. P.
      Wishing to ease his friend's mind asked Gerald Kelly to take him to Miss Q.'s address, at
      which Mrs. M. was then living. This Gerald Kelly did.</p>
      <p>Miss Q., after an interview, asked P. to tea to meet Mrs. M. After introduction, she
      left the room to make tea --- the White Magick and the Black were left face to face.</p>
      <p>On the mantelpiece stood a bronze head of Balzac, and P., taking it down, seated
      himself in a chair by the fire and looked at it.</p>
      <p>Presently a strange dreamy feeling seemed to come over him, and something velvet-soft
      and soothing and withal lecherous moved across</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{335}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>his hand. Suddenly looking up he saw that Mrs. M. had noiselessly quitted her seat and
      was bending over him; her hair was scattered in a mass of curls over her shoulders and the
      tips of her fingers were touching the back of his hand.</p>
      <p>No longer was she the middle-aged woman, worn with strange lusts; but a young woman of
      bewitching beauty.</p>
      <p>At once recognizing the power of her sorcery, and knowing that if he even so much as
      contemplated her gorgon head, all the power of his Magick would be petrified, and that he
      would become but a puppet in her hands, but a toy to be played with and when broken cast
      aside, he quietly rose as if nothing unusual had occurred; and placing the bust on the
      mantelpiece turned towards her and commenced with her a magical conversation; that is to
      say a conversation which outwardly had but the appearance of the politest small talk, but
      which inwardly lacerated her evil heart, and burnt into her black bowels as if each word
      had been a drop of some corrosive acid.</p>
      <p>She writhed back from him, and then again approached him even more beautiful than she
      had been before. She was battling for her life now, and no longer for the blood of another
      victim. If she lost, hell yawned before her, the hell that every once-beautiful woman who
      is approaching middle age, sees before her; the hell of lost beauty, of decrepitude, of
      wrinkles and fat. The odour of man seemed to fill her whole subtle form with a feline
      agility, with a beauty irresistible. One step nearer and then she sprang at Frater P. and
      with an obscene word sought to press her scarlet lips to his.</p>
      <p>As she do so Frater P. caught her and holding her at arm's length smote the sorceress
      with her own current of evil, just as a would-be murderer is sometimes killed with the
      very weapon with which he has attacked his victim.</p>
      <p>A blue-greenish light seemed to play round the head of the vampire, and then the flaxen
      hair turned the colour of muddy snow, and the fir skin wrinkled, and those eyes, that had
      turned so many happy lives to stone, dulled and became as pewter dappled with the dregs of
      wine. The girl of twenty had gone; before him stood a hag of sixty, bent, decrept,
      debauched. With dribbling curses she hobbled from the room.</p>
      <p>As Frater P. left the house, for some time he turned over in his mind these strange
      happenings and was not long in coming to the opinion that Mrs. M. was not working alone,
      and that behind her probably were forces far greater than she. She was but the puppet of
      others, the slave that would catch the kids and the lambs that were to be served upon her
      master's table. Could P. prove this? Could he discover who her masters were? The task was
      a difficult one; it either meant months of</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{336}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>work, which P. could not afford to give, or the mere chance of a lucky stroke which P.
      set aside as unworthy the attempt.</p>
      <p>That evening, whilst relating the story to his friend Gerald Kelly, he asked him if he
      knew any reliable clairvoyant. Gerald Kelly replied that he did, and that there was such a
      person at that very time in Paris known as the Sibyl, his own &quot;belle amie&quot;. That
      night they called on her; and from her P. discovered, for he led her in the spirit, the
      following remarkable facts.</p>
      <p>The vision at first was of little importance, then by degrees the seer was led to a
      house which P. recognized as that in which D.D.C.F. lived. He entered one of the rooms,
      which he also at once recognized; but curious to say, instead of finding D.D.C.F. and
      V.N.R. there, he found Theo and Mrs. Horos. Mr. Horos (M.S.R.) incarnated in the body of
      V.N.R. and Mrs. Horos (S.V.S.) in that of D.D.C.F. Their bodies were in orison; but their
      spirits were in the house of the fallen chief of the Golden Dawn.</p>
      <p>At first Frater P. was seized with horror at the sight, he knew not whether to direct a
      hostile current of will against D.D.C.F. and V.N.R., supposing them to be guilty of
      cherishing within their bodies the spirits of two disincarnated vampires, or perhaps
      Abra-Melin demons under the assumed forms of S.V.A. and M.S.R., or to warn D.D.C.F.;
      supposing him to be innocent, as he perhaps was, of so black and evil an offence. But, as
      he hesitated, a voice entered the body of the Sibyl and bade him leave matters alone,
      which he did. Not yet was the cup full.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This story is typical of my magical state of the time. I was behaving like a Master of
    Magick, but had no interest in my further progress. I had returned to Europe with a sort
    of feeling at the back of my mind that I might as well resume the Abra-Melin operation,
    and yet the debacle of Mathers somehow put me off; besides which, I was a pretty
    thorough-going Buddhist. My essay &quot;Science and Buddhism&quot; makes this clear. I
    published a small private edition of &quot;Berashith&quot; in Paris; but my spiritual
    state was in reality very enfeebled. I am beginning to suspect myself of swelled head with
    all its cohort of ills. I'm afraid I thought myself rather a little lion on the strength
    of my journey, and the big people in the artistic world in France accepted me quite
    naturally as a colleague.</p>
    <p>In England there is no such social atmosphere. Artists and writers are either isolated
    or members of petty cliques. It is impossible to do so much as give a dinner to a
    distinguished man without upsetting the antheap, and arousing the most insanely violent
    and personal jealousy. A writer who respects himself in England is bound to become a
    solitary like Hardy and Conrad; the greatness of his art debars him utterly from taking
    the smallest</p>
    <p>{337}</p>
    <p>part in the artistic affairs of the moment. In a way, this is not to his disadvantage,
    for the supreme genius does not need specialized human society; he is a home in the slums
    or on the countryside. The salon stifles him. The social intercourse between artists in
    France tends to civilize them, to bring them to a common level; and thus, though the
    average of good writers is far higher than in England, we can show more men of supreme
    attainment; we can even make a pretty shrewd guess who the masters are even during their
    lifetime, for we instinctively persecute them.</p>
    <p>Any spark of individuality is in England an outrage on decency. We pick out Sir Richard
    Burton, James Thomson, John Davidson, Ernst Dowson, and heaven knows how many others, for
    abuse, slander, ostracism, starvation or imprisonment. In our anxiety to do justice, we
    even annoy perfectly harmless people. At one time Alfred Tennyson was scoffed at as
    &quot;incomprehensible&quot;. Holman Hunt was denounced by Charles Dickens as an obscene
    painter, and his prosecution and imprisonment demanded. <em>Jude the Obscure</em> was
    nicknamed <em>Jude the Obscene</em>. Swinburn was denounced as &quot;the poet of the
    trough and the sty&quot;, and his publisher withdrew the first series of <em>Poems and
    Ballads</em> in panic. Rossetti and Morris came in for an equal share of abuse, and we all
    remember the denunciation of Ibsen, Meredity, Nietzsche, Maeterlinck, Tolstoy, in fact, of
    every man --- also Bernard Shaw --- without exception whose name is still in our memories.</p>
    <p>In France one attains eminence by a less gratuitous Golgotha. Men of art and letters
    are respected and honoured by each other and by the public. Their final position in
    history is quietly assigned by time. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a
    great man is awarded the distinction of a Calvary. Of course, Zola went through the mill;
    but only because he had butted into politics by his <em>J'accuse</em>; he was only
    denounced as obscene because any stick is good enough to beat a god with.</p>
    <p>But, as luck would have it, I had arrived in Paris on an occasion which history in
    France can hardly duplicate; Rodin was being attacked for his stature of Balzac. I was
    introduced to Rodin and at once fell in love with the superb old man and his colossal
    work. I still think his Balzac the most interesting and important thing he did. It was a
    new idea in sculpture. Before Rodin there had been certain attempts to convey spiritual
    truth by plastic methods; but they were always limited by the supposed necessity of
    &quot;representing&quot; what people call &quot;nature&quot;. The soul was to be the
    servant of the eye. One could only suggest the relations of a great man with the universe
    by surrounding a more or less photographic portrait of him with the apparatus of his life
    work. Nelson was painted with a background of three-deckers and a telescope under his arm;
    Wren with a pair of compasses in front of St. Paul's.</p>
    <p>Rodin told me how he had conceived his Balzac. He had armed himself</p>
    <p>{338}</p>
    <p>with all the documents; and they had reduced him to despair. (Let me say at once that
    Rodin was not a man, but a god. He had no intellect in the true sense of the word; his was
    a virility so superabundant that it constantly overflowed into the creation of vibrating
    visions. Naively enough, I haunted him in order to extract first-hand information about
    art from the fountain head. I have never met anyone --- white, black, brown, yellow, pink
    or spot-blue --- who was so completely ignorant of art as Auguste Rodin! At his best he
    would stammer out that nature was the great teacher or some equally puerile platitude. The
    books on art attributed to him are of course the compilation of journalists.)</p>
    <p>He was seized with a sort of rage of destruction, abandoned his pathetically pedantic
    programme. Filled with the sublime synthesis of the data which had failed to convey a
    concrete impression to his mind, he set to work and produced the existing Balzac. This
    consequently bore no relation to the incidents of Balzac's personal appearance at any
    given period. These things are only veils. Shakespeare would still have been Shakespeare
    if someone had thrown sulphuric acid in his face. The real Balzac is the writer of the <em>Comédie
    Humaine</em>; and what Rodin has done is to suggest this spiritual abstraction through the
    medium of form.</p>
    <p>Most people do not realize the power which genius possesses of comprehending the
    essence of a subject without the need of learning it laborously. A master in one art is at
    home in any other, without having necessarily practised it or studied its technicalities.
    I am reminded of the scene in Rodin's studio which I described in a sonnet. Some bright
    spirit had brought his fiddle and we were all bewitched. Rodin suddenly smiled and waved
    his hand towards &quot;Oan et Syrinx&quot;. I followed the gesture: the bars just played
    were identical with the curve of the jaw of the girl. The power to perceive such
    identities of essence beneath a difference of material manifestation is the inevitable
    token of mastery. Anyone who understands (not merely knows) one subject will also
    understand any other, whether he also knows it or not. Thus: suppose there had also been
    present a great gardener, a great geologist and a great mathematician. If they did not
    understand and approve that signal of Rodin's, I should refuse to admit that they were
    real masters, even of their own subjects. For I regard it as an infallible test of a
    master of any art or science that he should recognize intuitively (Neschamically) the
    silent truth, one and indivisible, behind all diversities of expression.</p>
    <p>I find by experience that any man well learned in a subject, but whose understanding of
    it falls short of the mastery I have described, will profoundly resent this doctrine. It
    minimizes the dignity of his laborious studies and in the end accuses him of inferior
    attainment. The more sophisticated victim can usually put up an apparently non-emotional
    defence in the form of a scepticism as to the facts, a scepticism those obstinate
    irrationality is</p>
    <p>{339}</p>
    <p>plain to an outside observer, but seems to the victim himself a simple defence of what
    he feels to be truth. This type of Freudian self-protection is often entirely
    passion-proof even against direct accusation of intellectual pride and jealousy. It relies
    on the ability of the mind to confuse, when hard-pressed, the essence of a subject with
    its accidents. Nothing but a very pure aspiration to truth --- and experience (often
    humiliating) of such reactions --- is of much use against this particular kind of bondage.</p>
    <p>While other defenders of Rodin were apologizing for him in detail I brushed aside the
    nonsense --- &quot;a plague o' both your houses!&quot; --- and wrote a sonnet, which is,
    in its way, to conventional criticism exactly what the Balzac was. It was translated into
    French by Marcel Schwob and made considerable stir in Paris. Even at this length of time,
    I attach a certain importance to it. For one thing, it marks a new stage in my own art.</p>
    <p align="center">BALZAC</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Giant, with iron secrecies ennighted,<br>
        Cloaked, Balzac stands and sees. Immense disdain,<br>
        Egyptian silence, mastery of pain,<br>
        Gargantuan laughter, shake or still the ignited<br>
        Stature of the Master, vivid. Far, affrighted,<br>
        The stunned air shudders on the skin. In vain<br>
        The Master of <em>La Comédie Humaine</em><br>
        Shadows the deep-set eyes, genius-lighted.</p>
        <p>Epithalamia, birth songs, epitaphs,<br>
        Are written in the mystery of his lips.<br>
        Sad wisdom, scornful shame, grand agony<br>
        In the coffin folds of the cloak, scarred mountains, lie,<br>
        And pity hides i' th' heart. Grim knowledge grips<br>
        The essential manhood. Balzac stands, and laughs.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The upshot was that Rodin invited me to come and stay with him at Meudon. The idea was
    that I should give a poetic interpretation of all his masterpieces. I produced a number of
    poems, many of which I published at the time in the <em>Weekly Critical Review</em>, an
