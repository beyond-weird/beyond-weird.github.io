    <p>Knowles and I were kept very busy from the fifth to the twenty-second of April.
    Everything had to be repacked in kiltas. These are baskets shaped either like wide-mouthed
    vases or like cabin trunks, and covered with raw hide to protect them from rough usage and
    bad weather. Our limit weight was fifty-three pounds. As a beast of burden, a mule is less
    efficient than a man, and a man that an woman. In Kashmir, however, one does not use women
    as coolies. The people are Mohammedans governed by a ruling caste of Hindus. This leads to
    complications; for one thing, though the river is full of mahsir, one is not allowed to
    fish for them, because one of them had swallowed the soul of the maharajah in his youth!
    Another inconvenience is that one cannot bet beef to eat, for Kashmir is theoretically an
    independent state. The Mohammedan has, of course, no objection to beef; it is the Hindu
    who prohibits it.</p>
    <p>A curious misfortune overtook a native in this connection. His little farm was on the
    banks of the Indus. During the winter two landslides cut him off completely from his
    neighbours. The mountain path could not be repaired until the spring. He saved himself
    from starvation by killing his cow. For this offence he barely escaped the penalty of
    death<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>We added to our stores by buying a large quantity of local products which it would have
    been more trouble to bring from England. In some cases this was a mistake. The matches
    procurable in Kashmir compare only too unfavourably with the worst products of France at
    its worst period. It was a champion box if it contained half a dozen matches which lit
    without argument. When we got to the glacier, we sued to spend much of our time on sunny
    days trying to dry them on convenient rocks.</p>
    <p>The general bandobast of the expedition was open to a good deal of criticism. One of
    Eckenstein's few failings was his faith in professorial science. Because the German
    soldier thrives on <em>Erbs-suppe</em> and the British on &quot;Bovril bacon
    rations&quot;, he expected us to do the same, with the result that much of our provisions
    was quite uneatable. The general plan was to pack biltas with supplies for one day for
    twelve men. We had thirty-six of these. In other kiltas were packed additional supplies to
    supplement what we could procure from the villages which we passed. Eckenstein was
    curiously obstinate about some details. I was certain that our supply of sugar was very</p>
    <p>{288}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">Later. Poor Sir Hari Singh paid dearly in 1923 for eating sirloin of
        beef! As bad as Jonathan and the honey!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>inadequate, but he opposed bitterly my proposal to add to it. I insisted on laying in
    an extra eighty pounds. Most of this was stolen by the Pathan contingent of servants and
    sold to the villagers on the journey. The result was that in the latter part of the
    expedition we suffered from sugar starvation, one of the most dreadful tortures that I
    have ever undergone.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein rejoined us on April 22nd and we started six days later. We had met with
    extreme kindness on the part of everybody in the valley and the assistance given but the
    government was invaluable. From start to finish there was not a single unpleasant incident
    and I shall always remember with the warmest gratitude and affection the hospitality of
    the English residents.</p>
    <p>We had a small staff major of Pathans, very handsome and fierce. The idea of taking
    them seems to have been to use their prestige with the Kashmiri who, while extraordinarily
    brave in face of inanimate dangers, are hopelessly timid in presence of a fighting race. I
    do not think these men were of much assistance at any time, and they ultimately had to be
    sacked and sent back, not only for their thieving but for their overbearing manner towards
    the people of the district.</p>
    <p>Next came our staff of personal servants, headed by Salama Tantra, who was in all
    respects an admirable servant, so much so that I brought him from Kashmir in 1905 and took
    him with me across China. His subordinates were all good men in their way and we had not
    trouble with them.</p>
    <p>Our transport as far as Askole, the last village, depended on local coolies or ponies,
    a hundred and fifty of one or fifty of the other. Occasionally the same set would make two
    or three marches with us, but as a rule they were changed every day. Except on one or two
    occasions when the ignorance and bad manners of the Austrians let to misunderstanding,
    everything went smoothly.</p>
    <p>The naivety of the natives was sometimes very amusing. The regular rate of pay was
    fourpence a day, and this princely profusion induced the inhabitants of distant side
    valleys to make sometimes as much as six days' march in each direction from their homes to
    some point on our route. They would then disseminate themselves among the crowd of coolies
    and present themselves to the paymaster. Their injured bewilderment on discovering that we
    only paid wages on presentation of a slip of paper with the coolie's name and number, and
    the safe arrival of the corresponding kilta, was really pitiful. But even more impressive
    is the original fact of their willingness to make so many days' journey in the hope of
    acquiring fourpence without working for it.</p>
    <p>Another incident has peculiar value as throwing light on the genesis of stories of
    miraculous healings. Our custom was to have the doctor establish a temporary clinic at
    every halting place, where he would attend to toothdrawing, tapping for dropsy and such
    simple matters. I remember one man</p>
    <p>{289}</p>
    <p>with a fang which stuck out completely through his cheek, leaving a jagged ulcer all
    round it. It was obviously impossible to undertake any cases of illness other than those
    requiring simple operations. Invariably, therefore, the cure was effected by the use of
    instruments, which were spread out on a blanket, while everybody looked on. Nevertheless,
    on our return, the sick from distant valleys having congregated to meet us, the first
    patient protested when the doctor produced his forceps. &quot;Oh no,&quot; said he.
    &quot;I want to be cured like the others; pit your hand on my head and make me well!&quot;</p>
    <p>The journey to the foot of Chogo Ri divides itself naturally into three main sections;
    six marches bring one to the foot of the Zoji La, the pass which divides Kashmir from
    Baltistan; twenty-one marches brings one to the foot of the Baltoro glacier; the rest is
    on the ice. As long as one is in Kashmir the travelling is comparatively easy, the marches
    reasonably short and the halting places comfortable. The scenery is exhilaratingly grand
    and beautiful, and the climate perfect. The whole thing may best be described as an
    exaggeration of all that is best and loveliest in the Alps, plus the enchantment of
    Asiatic atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Travellers to Chogo Ri are limited as to season by the fact that the Zoji La is
    impassable for coolies before a certain date, which varies little from year to year. We
    thought ourselves lucky to manage to cross so early in May as the fourth. In the autumn
    (again) it closes early, so that if one fails to get back to Kashmir before the snow
    blocks the pass, one is practically compelled to winter in Baltistan.</p>
    <p>A great fuss has been made about the actual difficulties and dangers of crossing the
    pass, but it is merely a long snow trudge. Pfannl and Wessely, who were always boiling
    over to exhibit their prowess, went up to the col to prospect. They reported on returning
    (a) that they could not see anything, (b) that the pass was very steep on the other side,
    and (c) that the other side was free from snow. On the following day we learnt that the
    first of these statements may have been correct; the other two enlarged my horizon as to
    the possibilities of inaccuracy.</p>
    <p>The slopes leading to the pass are uniformly easy and the reputed danger from
    avalanches exists only for people without any knowledge of snow. The doctor, however, gave
    us an idea of what we might expect from him. To this day I cannot understand how this
    misadventure failed to warn me. Just before reaching the top of the pass, he started to
    walk across a frozen lake. As he says, &quot;Confidant dans la solidité de la glace, je
    m'aventure un peu trop, lorsque, tout à coup, je fais un plongeon, intempestif à cette
    heure matinale ...&quot;!!</p>
    <p>My duty was to see that the caravans crossed the comparatively short section of the
    pass which the men dreaded. So I spent most of the morning rushing backwards and forwards,
    encouraging one, exhorting another and</p>
    <p>{290}</p>
    <p>giving a hand to a third. I had no reason to suppose that the reconnaissance of the
    Austrians was radically wrong. By the time the last man had come safely through the
    critical section, I was already tired; and when I started to follow, I found to my dismay
    that the Matayun side of the pass, instead of being steep, was at a very low gradient
    indeed; and, so far from being free from snow, was covered deeply. The day being well
    advanced, the going was softer and more slushy all the time. Even the tracks made by the
    coolies had not made the way decently walkable. Faint with exhaustion, I dragged myself
    into camp at five o'clock at night, after a thirteen hours' trudge during which I had
    hardly sat down.</p>
    <p>My eyes, too, were inflamed. In the Alps, I had found myself able to go all day in
    bright sunshine without dark goggles and be none the worse. In Mexico I became
    uncomfortable after an hour or two and had to put on my glasses. But in the Himalayas,
    even at low altitudes (the Zoji La is about five thousand metres), snow blindness is a
    real menace. When I got to the upper glacier, I found that ten minutes without goggles
    even under a clouded sky determined an attack.</p>
    <p>I was too exhausted even to eat until I had drunk half a bottle of champagne, after
    which I slept like a log. The next morning, I started late --- eight o'clock. The march,
    like that of the previous day, was fifteen miles, but only took six hours instead of
    thirteen, and would have been much less save for the soft snow of the earlier stages.
    There was no anxiety about the coolies, so that I had ample leisure to meditate on the
    extraordinary change of scenery on the far side of the Zoji. Nowhere else in the world
    have I found any similarly sudden and complete antithesis. Right up to Baltal, trees and
    flowers abound. On the other side of the pass is an astonishing abomination of desolation.
    Thence all the way to Skardu there is literally no scrap of vegetation, scarce even sparse
    rough grass; except where mountain torrents join the Indus. At such places, the natives
    have carried out an elaborate scheme of irrigation. The land is fashioned into terraces
    fertilized by a system of channels; and in these artificial fields they cultivate their
    crops, including apricots. In some places there are as many as five harvests a year. From
    a distance these oases appear very striking. The first impression is of a crisscross
    formed by the line of trees and the terraces. These villages glow with ineffable gladness.
    The marches, though often quite short in actual mileage on the map, are (generally
    speaking) quite severe. Eckenstein had observed humorously that from the top of the Zoji
    La it would be down hill all the way to Skardu, bar local irregularities. The piquancy of
    the remark lies in the fact that the total descent is less than ten thousand feet and that
    the average daily &quot;local irregularity&quot; approximates to double that amount. It is
    sometimes infuriating. One day, at the end (as I thought) of a long march, I caught sight
    of the goal not half a mile away, both it and I being close to the river. But a rocky
    buttress</p>
    <p>{291}</p>
    <p>gratuitously juts into the stream and the track makes a little detour of some three
    thousand feet in height to pass it.</p>
    <p>Apart from the mere fatigue of these marches, they are made detestable by the utter
    monotony and ugliness of the landscape. The mountains are huge hideous heaps of shapeless
    drab. There is hardly one noble contour; there is not rest for the eye; there is no
    aspiration and no interest --- nothing but a gnawing desire to be done with the day's
    dreary dragging. In addition to this there is a good deal of actual discomfort. The glare
    of the sun in very distressing and either it, or its reflection from the hot arid rocks,
    is scorching. At the same time it often happens that a bitterly biting wind is blowing. It
    seems to eat into one's very bones with harsh cold. One does not know what to do about
    clothes. On one side one is roasted; one the other frozen. It is easy to understand how
    the heart leaps whenever the eye falls upon the distant green lattice of a grove, and even
    how eagerly the eye looks for geological indication of the probability of one appearing.
    It is an additional annoyance that the mere distance one has travelled tells one so little
    as to what remains to be done, for the reasons given above.</p>
    <p>On some of these marches we were able to get ponies, though the Austrians disdained
    such effeminacy. The Indian hill pony compares very unfavourably with the Mexican. He is
    neither so swift, so strong, nor so surefooted. More often than not, too, he is in bad
    condition and sometimes actually lame. The best of them stumble at almost every other
    step, though ti is said that they never lose their footing completely. I could never rid
    my self altogether of nervousness. The road is officially the highway to Skardu and
    Yarkand, but it rarely amounts to more than a rough and narrow mountain track, scarce
    better than the paths to Alpine Club huts, at their worst. Some stages, indeed, are
    altogether impracticable for ponies, either because the track crosses a ravine by a rope
    bridge or because actually too steep for them to climb. The road is never dangerous from
    the point of view of the pedestrian, but it looks so to a man on horseback; for in a great
    many places its loose stones lie on the edge of what is a precipice for all practical
    purposes.</p>
    <p>At Hardas we were entertained by a magnificent but dirty rajah, who took me for a
    native. One noticed with amusement that a great many of the people whom public opinion at
    home classes as niggers were very much lighter in colour than any of our party.</p>
    <p>At Tolti we found another rajah equally urbane. Travel in the East is essential to any
    sort of understanding of the Bible. The equivalent of the word king is constantly used to
    describe men who may be anything from absolute monarchs over hundreds of thousands of
    people, to country squires or even headmen of a tribe of gypsies.</p>
    <p>We reached Skardu on the fourteenth of May, and put in four days making</p>
    <p>{292}</p>
    <p>arrangements for the next stage of the journey. We could no longer depend on finding
    enough coolies, the villages beyond Shigar being poorly populated.</p>
    <p>We took much credit to ourselves, and gave more to the efficiency of government
    officials, that we had come through from Srinagar without a day's halt, we the largest
    party of Europeans to have made the journey.</p>
    <p>Central Asia, by the way, is the home of polo, which is played to this day with the
    utmost enthusiasm. Needless to say, the game is free from the swanking exclusiveness of
    the European variety. I was never able to discover any particular rules. One simply rides
    into the mel&#130;e with any kind of a stick one happens to have and smites the ball with
    more vigour than intention. If one feels that one's side is too strong for the other, one
    simply changes over. The local rajah and the poorest farmer of the district meet in the
    game with the noble equality of &quot;chivalry&quot; in the true sense, the esprit de
    corps of horsemen.</p>
    <p>The exhilaration of the game is extraordinary. Played as it is, it is free from the
    lust of result which has spoilt practically all sorts and games in Europe. Strange that in
    my old age I should suddenly find myself acquiescing in the absurdity which angered me so
    when a boy, Champney's plan of playing cricket without scoring runs. After all, the madman
    was right. It would be far finer to play the game for the sake of enjoying the free
    exercise of one's enthusiasm. True it is, scoring does lead to post-mortem controversies
    which are not in the spirit of sport. Climbing itself is being very much spoilt by the
    attitude of the Alpine Club in insisting that the achievement, not the enjoyment, is the
    important thing. It has let to their virulent, dishonest, envious intrigues against
    guideless climbing and climbers. This is the American spirit, to count and compare instead
    of being content with spiritual satisfaction. This is what is meant by the Scripture,
    &quot;The love of money is the root of all evil.&quot;</p>
    <p>This spirit is at the root of all modern attempts at standardization of attainment and
    it leads directly to every kind of foul play, falsehood, cheating and controversy.
    Consider merely American football and baseball; the drilling of the teams to carry out a
    series of evolutions designated by a string of ciphers. Again, what of the intrigues to
    attain the transfer of professional players, to say nothing of the possible selling of
    matches to syndicates of gamblers? Sport of all kinds has tended to become spectacular and
    gladiatorial even in games like lawn tennis, which was originally the very incarnation of
    social amenity. It is the same story everywhere; see boxing, in which a man may get more
    for half an hour's battery than any dozen university professors receive for a lifetime of
    devoted labour on behalf of the race. The root of the mischief is the spirit of taking
    life too seriously. It is really almost expected of the man who happens to run over to
    Philadelphia from New York</p>
    <p>{293}</p>
    <p>for a day, that he should forthwith write an encyclopaedic history of the Quakers.</p>
    <p>It is hard to prophesy the issue of this tendency, but one can see already that the
    chivalry of sport is following that of arms into oblivion.</p>
