    <p>As I was sitting at lunch one day in the Hermitage beginning a lyrical ritual intended
    for the use of an individual in his private work, I found myself, in the middle of a
    sentence, at a loss for the next word. I have already explained how swiftly and
    spontaneously my spirit soars from stanza to stanza without need of previous reflection or
    subsequent revision. In all these weeks my pen had swung like a skater over the paper. Now
    suddenly it stopped; an eagle in full flight stricken by a shaft. That sentence has never
    been completed. The inspiration was withdrawn from me. My light had gone out like an
    arc-light when the cable is cut. It was long before I wrote again.</p>
    <p>Three days later, the contract at the Aquarium was due to expire; and those days proved
    to me how perfectly my existence depended on inspiration. The city, from a crashing chorus
    of magical music, a pageant of passionate pleasure, became a cold chaos of inanity. The
    bells no longer sang; the sun and moon were stagnant, soulless spectres in a senseless sky
    --- like a ghost on the gusts of the gale. I went from miraculous Moscow into a world of
    inarticulate impressions. St Petersburg failed to rekindle the wonder and worship which it
    had awakened in me of old. The Nevski Prospekt seemed narrower, meaner; a mere street. St
    Isaacs no longer enthralled me. I was able to compare the Neva with the Nile, the Ganges,
    the Rangoon River, and even the Rhine, as coldly and critically as Baedeker. My spirit
    need infinite repose after its incomparable effort, and this repose was granted to it by
    the voyage to Stockholm.</p>
    <p>There are ways amid the Western Isles of Scotland, through the Norwegian fjords, and
    sometimes upon tropic seas, which speak to the soul in a language unknown to any other
    scenes. There is a solemnity and a serenity in their continual silence which seem not of
    this world. But the summer voyage across the Baltic, amid the archipelago is sovereign
    above any of these. There is no single ripple on the sea, no stirring in the air; the
    night is indistinguishable from the day, for neither suffers interruption; the steamer
    skins the surface of the sea as swift and silent as a swallow. One cannot even hear the
    engines, so utterly does their rhythm interpenetrate the totality of experience. There is
    a sense of floating in fairyland. One forgets the land whence one has come; one has no
    vision of the coast to which one is speeding. It seems impossible that the journey even
    began, still less, that its end is appointed.</p>
    <p>One seems to flit between innumerable islands, some crowned with foliage,</p>
    <p>{718}</p>
    <p>some mere bare gray knolls, scarce peeping from the waveless mirror of water. There is
    a sense of infinite intricacy of intention as the steamer insinuates itself into one
    curving channel after another, or comes out suddenly from a labyrinth of lyrical islands
    into a shoreless silence. One's mind is utterly cut off, not only from terrestrial
    thoughts, but from all definite ideas soever. It is impossible to accept what we commonly
    call actuality as having any real existence. One neither sleeps nor wakes from the moment
    when Kronstadt fades to a pale purple phantom of the past till Stockholm springs from the
    sea, as if the Lethean languor of a dreamless death, a mere deliciously indefinite
    serenity, were being gently awakened to understand that its unguessed goal was at last in
    sight. The negative ecstasy of perfect release from the pressure of existence developed
    into its positive equivalent when the soul, soothed and made strong, by its swoon into
    stainless silence, was ready to spring, sublimely self-sufficient, to the summit of its
    starry stature, to grasp and grapple with the manifested majesty of the Most High ...</p>
    <p>In vain have I striven to compel language to convey the meaning of that miraculous
    voyage. It stands aloof, so pure and perfect in itself that naught can blur its beauty. It
    remains in my memory uncontaminated by the sordid stupidity of Stockholm, the tedium of
    the discomfortable dreariness of the return to London.</p>
    <p>I found my work precisely where I had left it. The tenth and last number of <em>The Equinox</em></a> was published in due course. There
    was a certain pride in having triumphed over such opposition, in having &quot;carried
    on&quot; despite neglect, misunderstanding and treachery; in having achieved so many
    formidable tasks. There was also infinite satisfaction in so many signal successes. I
    could not doubt that I had made the Path of Initiation plain. It was beyond doubt that any
    man of ordinary energy, integrity and intelligence might now attain in a very few months
    what, until now, had meant years of desperate devotion. I had destroyed the superstition
    that spiritual success depended on dogma. I was thus able, to some extent, to go
    fearlessly into the presence of the Secret Chiefs who had chosen me to carry out their
    plans for the welfare of mankind, and say with upright head that I had not wholly proved
    unworthy of their trust. Yet withal, there was a certain sadness such as, I suppose, every
    man feels when he comes to the end of a definite stage in his career. Nevertheless, I knew
    that those who had thus far used me would not now throw me aside; that higher and holier
    service would be found for me.</p>
    <p>During the autumn and until the solstice I went on with my regular work as usual, but
    with a subconscious awareness that my future lay in other fields; something was sure to
    happen to change the whole current of my life. Subtly enough, this change came about by
    diverting me from the public</p>
    <p>{719}</p>
    <p>action to which I had so long been bound by the sheer necessity of producing <em>The Equinox</em></a> on definite dates. I began to pay
    more attention to my own personal progress.</p>
    <p>It must here be explained that my innate diffidence forbad me to aspire to the Grade of
    Magus in any full sense. Such beings appear only in every two thousand years or so. I knew
    too well my own limitations. It is true that I had been used as a Magus in the Cairo
    working; that is, I had been chosen to utter the Word of a New Aeon. But I did not regard
    this as being <em>my</em> Word. I felt myself ridiculously unworthy of the position
    assigned to me in <em>The Book of the Law</em> itself. When therefore I proposed to devote
    myself to my own initiations, I meant no more than this: that I would try to perfect
    myself in the understanding and powers proper to a Master of the Temple. At the end of
    1913, I found myself in Paris with a Zelator of the Order, Frater L. T. I had been working
    on the theory of the magical method of the O.T.O.; and we decided to test my conclusions
    by a series of invocations.</p>
    <p>We began work on the first day of the year and continued without interruption for six
    weeks. We invoked the gods Mercury and Jupiter; and obtained many astonishing results of
    many kinds, ranging from spiritual illumination to physical phenomena. It is impossible to
    transcribe the entire record, and to give excerpts would only convey a most imperfect and
    misleading idea of the result. As an example of actual intellectual illumination, however,
    I may quote the very impressive identification of the Christ of the gospels with Mercury.
    This came as a complete surprise, we having till then considered him as an entirely solar
    symbol connected especially with Dionysus, Mithras and Osiris.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the beginning was the Word, the Logos, who is Mercury, and is therefore to be
      identified with Christ. Both are messengers; their birth mysteries are similar; the pranks
      of their childhood are similar. In the Vision of the Universal Mercury, Hermes is seen
      descending upon the sea, which refers to Maria. The Crucifixion represents the caduceus;
      the two thieves, the two serpents; the cliff in the Vision of the Universal Mercury is
      Golgotha; Maria is simply Maia with the solar R in her womb.</p>
      <p>The controversy about Christ between the synoptics and John was really a contention
      between the priests of Bacchus, Sol and Osiris, also, perhaps, of Adonis and Attis, on the
      one hand, and those of Hermes on the other, at that period when initiation all over the
      world found it necessary, owing to the growth of the Roman empire, and the opening up of
      means of communication, to replace conflicting polytheisms by a synthetic faith. (This is
      absolutely new to me, this conception</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{720}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>of Christ as Mercury.) Some difficulty about the ... (This sentence is now quite
      unintelligible.)</p>
      <p>To continue the identification, compare Christ's descent into hell with the function of
      Hermes as guide of the dead. Also Hermes leading up Eurydice, and Christ raising up
      Jairus' daughter. Christ is said to have risen on the third day, because it takes three
      days for the planet Mercury to become visible after separating from the orb of the sun.
      (It may be noted here that Mercury and Venus are the planets between us and the sun, as if
      the Mother and the Son were mediators between us and the Father.)</p>
      <p>Note Christ as the Healer, and also his own expression, &quot;The son of Man cometh as
      a thief in the night&quot;; and also this scripture (Matt. XXIV, 27), &quot;For as the
      lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming
      of the Son of Man be.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note also Christ's relations with the money changers, his frequent parables, and the
      fact that his first disciple was a publican.</p>
      <p>Note also Mercury as the deliverer of Prometheus.</p>
      <p>One half of the fish symbol is also common to Christ as Mercury; fish are sacred to
      Mercury (owing presumably to their quality of movement). (This I did not know before.)
      Many of Christ's disciples were fishermen and he was always doing miracles in connexion
      with fish.</p>
      <p>Note also Christ as the mediator: &quot;No man cometh unto the Father but by Me&quot;,
      and Mercury as Chokmah through whom alone we can approach Kether.</p>
      <p>The caduceus contains a complete symbol of the Gnosis; the winged sun or phallus
      represents the joy of life on all planes from the lowest to the highest. The Serpents,
      besides being active and passive, Horus and Osiris, and all their other well-known
      attributions are those qualities of Eagle and Lion respectively, of which we know but do
      not speak. It is the symbol which unites the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, the symbol of
      the Magical Operation which accomplishes this. The caduceus is the universal solvent. It
      is quite easy to turn quicksilver into gold on the physical plane, and this will soon be
      done. New life will flow through the world in consequence. The god now lays his caduceus
      upon my lips for silence; bidding me only remember that on the following night he is to
      come in another form.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The temple was then closed.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our occasional failures produced results as striking and instructive as our successes.
    For instance, having made an error in invoking Mercury, and thus having created a current
    of force contrary to his nature, we observed that events of a Mercurial character, no
    matter how normal, failed to occur. For</p>
    <p>{721}</p>
    <p>one thing, all communications with the outer world were completely cut off for
    sometime. It had been arranged that I should receive a daily report from London from my
    secretary. None arrived for five days; and that although nothing had gone wrong in London.
    No explanation was ever forthcoming. This is one of the many incidents tending to similar
    conclusions, all explicable only on the theory that the natural energy, which is normally
    present and is necessary to the occurrence of certain types of event, had somehow been
    inhibited.</p>
    <p>The Jupiterian phenomena were especially remarkable. We performed in all sixteen
    operations to invoke this force. It seemed at first as if our work actually increased the
    normal inertia. Jupiterian phenomena which we had every right to expect simply failed to
    happen. Even in the matter of banqueting, which we were supposed to do lavishly in his
    honour, the opposition became overwhelming. Hungry as we might be, we seemed unable to
    force ourselves to eat even a light meal. Quite suddenly the invisible barrier broke down
    and Jupiterian phonemena of the most unexpected kind simply rained on us. To mention one
    incident only; a Brother who had always been desperately poor suddenly came into a fortune
    and insisted on contributing five hundred pounds to the use of the Order.</p>
    <p>I must mention one incident of the Paris working as being of general interest, outside
    technical Magick. During the operation I had a bad attack of influenza, which settled down
    to very severe bronchitis. I was visited one evening by an old friend of mine and her
    young man, who very kindly and sensibly suggested that I should find relief if I smoked a
    few pipes of opium. They accordingly brought the apparatus from their apartment and we
    began. (Opium, by the way, is sacred to Jupiter, and to Chesed, Mercy, as being sovereign
    against pain, and also as enabling the soul to free itself from its gross integument and
    realize its majesty.) My bronchitis vanished; I went off to sleep; my guests retiring
    without waking me. In my sleep I dreamt; and when I woke the dream remained absolutely
    perfect in my consciousness, down to the minutest details. It was a story, a subtle
    exposure of English stupidity, set in a frame of the craziest and most fantastically
    gorgeous workmanship. Ill as I was, I jumped out of bed and wrote down the story offhand.
    I called it &quot;The Strategem&quot;. No doubt it was inspired by Jupiter, for it was the
    first short story that I had ever written which was accepted at once. More: I was told ---
    nothing in my life ever made me prouder --- that Joseph Conrad said it was the best short
    story he had read in ten years.</p>
    <p>We ourselves became identified with Jupiter, but in different aspects. Frater L. T. was
    for some months following the personification of generosity, through himself with the most
    meagre resources. All sorts of strangers planted themselves on him and he entertained
    them. In my own case, I became that type of Jupiter which we connect with the idea of
    prosperity,</p>
    <p>{722}</p>
    <p>authority and amativeness. I received numerous occult dignities; I seemed to have
    plenty of money without quite knowing how it happened; and I found myself exercising an
    almost uncanny attraction upon every woman that came into my circle of acquaintance.</p>
    <p>To me, however, as a student of nature, the one important result of this work was the
    proof of the efficacy of the magical method employed. Henceforth, I made it my principal
    study, kept a detailed record of my researches, and began to discover the rational
    explanation of its operation and the conditions of success.</p>
    <p>More important yet, in the deepest sense, was a feature of the result which I failed to
    observe at the time, and even for some years after. In veiled language are hints,
    unmistakable as soon a detected, that I was even then, by means of the working itself,
    being prepared for the initiation thereto. The actual ceremony (using the word in its
    widest and deepest sense) extended over some years and is in fact the sole key to the
    events of that period. An outline therefore must consequently form a separate chapter, for
    without the light thereby thrown upon the facts of my career, they must appear incoherent,
    inconsequential and unintelligible. I was destined to undergo a series of experiences
    which apparently contradict the whole tendency of the past. My actions seem incompatible
    with my character; my environment seems incomprehensibly unnatural; in short, the effect
    of the narrative is to suggest that by some jugglery the life of a totally different
    individual has intruded upon my own.</p>
    <p>Now, years afterwards, it still seems to me as if for the whole period of the
    initiation I had been transported into an unfamiliar world; their history is a magical
    history in the most comically complete sense. Its events are neither real nor rational ---
    save only in relation to the condition of an experiment, exactly as a candidate in
    freemasonry sees, hears, speaks and acts with his normal senses, yet in a way which has no
    relation to his previous experience. The stolid old gentleman in evening dress is really
    King Solomon. He hears a rigmarole both false and meaningless in itself, which he must
    understand as conveying something entirely other than it apparently implies. His words are
    put into his mouth, and produce an effect neither expected, desired, nor understood. He
    performs a series of gestures neither comprehensible in themselves, nor even (so far as he
    can see) calculated to assist his purpose. And even when, at the end, he finds that he has
    complied with the prescribed conditions and achieved his object, he is unable to bring
    what has taken place into rational relation with his ordinary life. The situation is only
    the more bewildering that from first to last each incident in itself is perfectly common
    place.</p>
    <p>Such is my own point of view with regard to my adventures in America. They are all
    perfectly probably in themselves, perfectly intelligible regarded</p>
    <p>{723}</p>
    <p>as details of a ritual; but they contradict every probability of human life as commonly
    understood. The chain of my career snaps suddenly; yet it continues as if it had never
    been broken from the moment that my initiation is over. The effect is to persuade me that
    this period of my life is in the nature of a dream. I meet strange monsters; one phantom
    succeeds another without a shadow of coherence. Even those incidents which help me to
    recognize that I am the central figure of the dream complete my conviction of its
    unreality.</p>
