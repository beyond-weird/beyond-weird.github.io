    <p>When Alick was about six years old his father moved from Leamington to Redhill, Surrey.
    There was some reason connected with a gravel soil and country life. The house was called
    The Grange. It stood in a large long garden ending in woods which overhung the road
    between Redhill and Merstham; about a mile, perhaps a little more, from Redhill. Alick
    lived here until 1886 and his memory of this period is of perpetual happiness. He
    remembers with the utmost clearness innumerable incidents and it becomes hard to select
    those which possess significance. He was taught by tutors; but they have faded, though
    their lessons have not. He was very thoroughly grounded in geography, history, Latin and
    arithmetic. His cousin, Gregor Grant, six years older than himself, was a constant
    visitor; a somewhat strange indulgence, as Gregor was brought up in Presbyterianism. The
    lad was very proud of his pedigree. Edward Crowley used to ridicule this, saying, &quot;My
    family sprang from a gardener who was turned out of the garden for stealing his master's
    fruit.&quot; Edward Crowley would not allow himself to be addressed as &quot;Esquire&quot;
    or even &quot;Mr.&quot; It seems a piece of atavism, for a Crowley had petitioned Charles
    I to take away the family coat of arms; his successor, however, had asked Charles II to
    restore them, which was done. This is evidence of the satanic pride of the race. Edward
    Crowley despised worldly dignities because he was a citizen of heaven. He would not accept
    favour or honour from any one less than Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Alick remembers a lady calling at the house for a subscription in aid of Our Soldiers
    in Egypt. Edward Crowley browbeat and bullied her into tears with a philippic on
    &quot;bibles and brandy&quot;. He was, however, bitterly opposed to the Blue Ribbon Army.
    He said that abstainers were likely to rely on good works to get to heaven and thus fail
    to realize heir need of Jesus. He preached one Sunday in the town hall, saying, &quot;I
    would rather preach to a thousand drunkards than a thousand T-totallers.&quot; They
    retorted by accusing him of being connected with &quot;Crowley's Ales&quot;. He replied
    that he had been an abstainer for nineteen years, during which he had shares in a brewery.
    He had now ceased to abstain for some time, but all his money was invested in a waterworks<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Besides Gregor Grant, Alick's only playmates were the sons of local Brethren.
    Aristocratic feeling was extremely strong. The usual boyish play-acting,</p>
    <p>{46}</p>
    <p>in which various personalities of the moment, such as Sir Garnet Wolseley and Arabi
    Pasha, were represented, was complicated in practice by a united attack on what were
    called cads. Alick especially remembers lying in wait at the end of the wood for children
    on their way to the National School. They had to cross a barrage of arrows and peas and
    ultimately got so scared that they found a roundabout way.</p>
    <p>Facing the drive, across the road, was a sand-pit. Alick remembers jumping from the top
    with a alpenstock and charging a navvy at work in the pit, knocking him down, and bolting
    home. But he was not always so courageous. He once transfixed, with the same alpenstock,
    the bandbox of an errand-boy. The boy, however, was an Italian; and pursued the aggressor
    to The Grange, when of course the elders intervened. But he remembers being very
    frightened and tearful because of some connection in his mind between Italians and
    stabbing. Here again is a curious point of psychology. He has no fear of being struck or
    cut; but the idea of being pierced disturbs his nerve. He has to pull himself together
    very vigorously even in the matter of a hypodermic syringe.</p>
    <p>There has always been something suggesting the oriental --- Chinese or ancient Egyptian
    --- in Alick's personal appearance. As his mother at school had been called &quot;the
    little Chinese girl&quot;, so his daughter, Lola Zaza, has the Mongolian physiognomy even
    more pronounced. His thought follows this indication. He has never been able to sympathize
    with any European religion or philosophy; and of Jewish or Mohammedan thought he has
    assimilated only the mysticism of the Cabbalists and the Sufis. Even Hindu psychology,
    thoroughly as he studied it, never satisfied him wholly. As will be seen, Buddhism itself
    failed to win his devotion. But he found himself instantly at home with the <em>Yi King</em>
    and the writings of Lao Tzu. Strangely enough, Egyptian symbolism and magical practice
    made an equal appeal; incompatible as these two systems appear on the surface, the one
    being atheistic, anarchistic and quietistic, the other theistic, hierarchical and active.
    Even at this period the East called to him. There is one very significant episode. In some
    history of the Indian Mutiny was the portrait of Nana Sahib, a proud, fierce, cruel,
    sensual profile. It was his ideal of beauty. He hated to believe that Nana Sahib had been
    caught and killed. He wanted to find Nana Sahib, to become his ally, share in torturing
    prisoners, and yet to suffer at his hands. When Gregor Grant was pretending to be Hyder
    Ali, and himself Tipu Sahib, he once asked his cousin, &quot;Be cruel to me.&quot;</p>
    <p>The influence of Cousin Gregor at this time was paramount. When Gregor was Rob Roy,
    Alick was Greumoch, the outlaw's henchman in James Grant's novel. The MacGregors appealed
    to Alick as being the most royal, wronged, romantic, brave and solitary of the clans.
    There can be no doubt that this phantasy played a great part in determining his
    passionate.</p>
    <p>{47}</p>
    <p>Admiration of the chief of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a Hampshire man named
    Mathers who inexplicably claimed to be MacGregor of Glenstrae.</p>
    <p>The boy's attitude to his parents is one of the most remarkable facts of his early
    life. His father was his hero and his friend, though, for some reason or other, there was
    no real conscious intimacy or understanding. He always disliked and despised his mother.
    There was a physical repulsion, and an intellectual and social scorn. He treated her
    almost as a servant. It is perhaps on this account that he remembers practically nothing
    of her during this period. She always antagonized him. He remembers one Sunday when she
    found him reading <em>Martin Rattler</em> and scolded him. Edward Crowley took his part.
    If the book was good enough to read on any day, why not on Sunday? To Edward Crowley,
    every day was the Lord's Day; sabbatarianism was Judiasm.</p>
    <p>When Alick was eight or thereabouts he was taken by his father to his first school.
    This was a private school at St. Leonards, kept by an old man named Habershon and his two
    sons, very strict Evangelicals. Edward Crowley wanted to warn his son against the
    commonest incident of English school life. He took a very wise way. He read to the boy
    very impressively the story of Noah's intoxication and its results, concluding:
    &quot;Never let any one touch you there.&quot; In this way, the injunction was given
    without arousing morbid curiosity.</p>
    <p>Alick remembers little of his life at this school beyond a vivid visual recollection of
    the playground with its &quot;giant's stride&quot;. He does not remember any of the boys,
    though the three masters stand out plainly enough. One very extraordinary event remains.
    In an examination paper, instead of answering some question or other, he pretended to
    misunderstand it and wrote an answer worthy of James Joyce. Instead of selling a limited
    edition at an extravagant price, he was soundly briched. Entirely unrepentant, he began to
    will Old Habershon's death. Strangely enough, this occurred within a few weeks; and he
    unhesitatingly took the credit to himself.</p>
    <p>The boy's intellect was amazingly precocious. It must have been very shortly after the
    move to Redhill that a tailor named Hemming came from London to make new clothes for his
    father. Being a &quot;brother&quot;, he was a guest in the house. He offered to teach
    Alick chess and succeeded only too well, for he lost every game after the first. The boy
    recalls the method perfectly. It was to catch a developed bishop by attacking it with
    pawns. (He actually invented the Tarrasch Trap in the Ruy Lopez before he ever read a book
    on chess.) This wrung from his bewildered teacher the exclamation, &quot;Very judicious
    with his pawns is your son, Mrs. Crowley!&quot;</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, there must have been more than this in it. Alick had assuredly a
    special aptitude for the game; for he never met his master till one</p>
    <p>{48}</p>
    <p>fatal day in 1895, when W. V. Naish, the President of the C. U. Ch. C., took the
    &quot;fresher&quot; who had beaten him to Peterhouse, the abode of Mr. H. E. Atkins, since
    seven times amateur champion of England and still a formidable figure in the Masters'
    Tournament.</p>
    <p>It may here be noted that the injudicious youth tried to trap Atkins with a new move
    invented by himself. It consists of playing K R B Sq, instead of Castles, in the Muzio
    Gambit, the idea being to allow White to play P Q 4 in reply to Q B 3.</p>
    <p>In 1885 Alick was removed from St. Leonards to a school kept by a Plymouth Brother, an
    ex-clergyman named H. d'Arcy Champney, M.A. It is a little difficult to explain the boy's
    psychology at this period. It was probably determined by his admiration for his father,
    the big, strong, hearty leader of men, who swayed thousands by his eloquence. He sincerely
    wished to follow in those mighty footsteps and so strove to imitate the great man as best
    he might. Accordingly, he aimed at being the most devoted follower of Jesus in the school.
    He was not hypocritical in any sense.</p>
    <p>All this strikes one as absolutely natural; what is extraordinary is the sequel.</p>
    <p>A letter dating from his early school life at Cambridge:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Dear Papa &amp; Mama,<br>
      For my holiday work prize I have got a splendid knife, 2 blades, a saw, a screwdriver, a
      thing to pull out thorns, another to get stones out of horse's shoes, another I don't know
      what for, a leather piercer, a gimlet &amp; a corkscrew and name plate. It is nicol plated
      in some parts, but the handle is ivory. The asphalt<strong>2</strong> gave way near the
      middle. We were nearly blown hup bu the hoiler<strong>3</strong> a little while ago, no
      jokes. We had a ½ holiday given us on Friday. Please send me a little money for
      fireworks. Send up my bankbook by the 1st please. I am awfully well, thank you! I have
      joined a sort of band of chaps, who are with God's blessing, going to try &amp; help
      others &amp; speak to them about their souls. I will write soon again. Write quick please.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Good bye<br>
              Yr loving son<br>
              Alec</p>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He was thoroughly happy at this school; the boys liked and admired him; he made
    remarkable progress in his studies and was very proud of his first prize, White's <em>Selborne</em>,
    for coming out top in &quot;Religious Knowledge, Classics and French&quot;.</p>
    <p>But to this day he has never read the book! For certain lines of study he had</p>
    <p>{9}</p>
    <p>a profound, instinctive and ineradicable aversion. Natural history, in any form, is one
    of these. It is hard to suggest a reason. Did he dislike to analyse beauty? Did he feel
    that certain subjects were unimportant, led to nothing that he wanted to explore? However
    this may be, he used to make up his mind with absolute finality as to whether he would or
    would not take some particular course. If he would, be panted after it like the hart after
    the water brooks; if no, nothing would persuade him to waste an hour on it.</p>
    <p>It was while he was at this school that he began to write poetry. He had read none,
    except &quot;Casabianca&quot;, &quot;Excelsior&quot;, the doggerel of Sir Walter Scott and
    such trash. But he had a genuine love for the simple <em>Hymns for the little Flock</em>
    compiled by the &quot;Brethren&quot;. His first taste of real poetry was <em>Lycidas</em>,
    set for the Cambridge Local Examination, if his memory serves him aright. He fell in love
    with it at once and had it by heart in a few days. But his own earliest effort is more on
    the lines of the hymnal. Only a few lines remain.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Terror, and darkness, and horrid despair!<br>
        Agony painted upon the once fair<br>
        Brow of the man who refused to give up<br>
        The love of the wine-filled, the o'erflowing cup.<br>
        &quot;Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.&quot;<br>
        No wine in death is his torment assuaging.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of this Redhill period there remain also memories of two summers, one in France and
    Switzerland, the other in the Highlands.</p>
    <p>The former has left numerous traces, chiefly of a visual character; the Grand Hotel in
    Paris, Lucerne and the Lion, William Tell, the Bears at Berne, the Rigi, the Staubbach,
    Trummelbach and Giessbach, Basle and the Rhine, the Dance of Death. Two points only
    concern us: he objected violently to being taken out in the cold morning to see the
    sunrise from a platform on the Rigi-Kulm and to illumination of a waterfall by coloured
    lights. He felt acutely that nature should be allowed to go her own way and he his! There
    was plenty of beauty in the world; why make oneself uncomfortable in order to see an
    extra? Also, you can't improve a waterfall by stagecraft!</p>
    <p>There is the skeleton of quite a philosophy of life in this.</p>
    <p>As to the Scottish Highlands, the boy's mind had been so poisoned by romance that he
    saw nothing that he can remember. The scenery was merely a setting for silly daydreams of
    Roderick Dhu!</p>
    <p>Three other episodes of the Redhill period are pertinent; not that they are in
    themselves very significant, save that two of them exhibit Alick in the character of a
    normally mischievous boy with some skill in playing upon other people's psychology. But
    they illustrate the singular environment.</p>
    <p>A frequent guest at The Grange was an old gentleman named Sherrall, whose vice was
    castor oil. Edward Crowley was in the habit of holding</p>
    <p>{50}</p>
    <p>&quot;tea meetings&quot;; a score or so of people would be invited to what is vulgarly
    known as a blow-out, and when the physical animal was satisfied, there would be a debauch
    of spiritual edification. On the mahogany table in the diningroom, extended to its fullest
    length, would stand two silver urns of tea. Into one of these young Alick emptied Mr.
    Sherrall's caster oil. So far, so good. The point is this, that the people served from
    that urn were too polite or overawed either to call the attention of their hostess or to
    abstain from the accursed beverage. The only precaution necessary was to prevent that lady
    herself from seeing one of the doctored cups.</p>
    <p>A rather similar jest was played at a prayer meeting at the house of a Brother named
    Nunnerley. Refreshment was offered before the meeting; and a Sister, named Mrs. Musty, had
    been marked down on account of her notorious greed. Alick and some fellow conspirators
    kept on plying her with food after every one else had finished, with the object of
    delaying the prayer meeting. The women herself was too stupid to see what was happening
    and the Brethren could not be rude enough even to hint their feelings.</p>
    <p>This hesitation to act with authority, which was part of the general theoretical P. B.
    objection to priestcraft, on one occasion reached an astounding point in the following
    circumstances. A Mr. Clapham, the odour of whose beard proclaimed him truthfully a
    fishmonger, had a wife and a daughter who was engaged to a Mr. Munday. These three had
    gone on an excursion to Boulogne; and, by accident or design, the engaged couple missed
    the boat for Folkestone. It was again a question of avoiding even the appearance of evil
    and Mrs. Clapham was expelled from fellowship. It is to be presumed that her husband
    believed her innocent of all complicity, as a priori appears the most natural hypothesis.
    In any case, next Sunday morning she took her place with her husband at the Lord's Table.
    It is almost inconceivable that any gathering of human beings, united to celebrate the
    supreme sacrament of their creed, should have been destitute of any means of safeguarding
    common decency. But the fear of the priest was paramount; and the entire meeting waited
    and fidgeted for over an hour in embarrassed silence. Ultimately, a baker named Banfield
    got up trembling in inquired timorously: &quot;May I ask Mr. Clapham if it is Mrs.
    Clapham's intention to break bread this morning&quot; Mrs. Clapham then bounced out of the
    room and slammed the door, after which the meeting proceeded as usual.</p>
    <p>Bourbonism still survives among some people in England. I remember explaining some
    action of mine to Gerald Kelly as taken on my lawyer's advice. He answered contemptuously,
    &quot;Lawyers are servants!&quot; The social position of the Lord Chancellor and other
    legal officers of the Crown meant no more to him than the preponderance of lawyers on the
    councils of the nation. He stuck to the futile stupidity that any man who used his brains
    to earn a living was an inferior. This is an extreme case of an exceptionally</p>
    <p>{51}</p>
    <p>stupid standpoint, but the psychological root of the attitude permeates English
    conceptions. The definition of self-respect contains a clause to include pitiless contempt
    for some other class. In my childhood, Mrs. Clapham --- one of whose adventures has been
    already recorded --- once came to the grain in conjugal infelicity. &quot;How could I ever
    love that man?&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;why, he takes his salt with his knife!&quot;
    There is nothing to warn a fishmonger's wife that such sublime devotion to etiquette is in
    any way ridiculous. English society is impregnated from top to bottom with this spirit.
    The supreme satisfaction is to be able to despise one's neighbour and this fact goes far
    to account for religious intolerance. It is evidently consoling to reflect that the people
    next door are headed for hell.</p>
    <p>Practically all boys are born with the aristocratic spirit<strong>4</strong>. In most
    cases they are broken down, partly by bullying, partly by experience. In the case of
    Alick, he was the only son of a father who was naturally a leader of men. In him,
    therefore, this spirit grew unchecked. He knew no superior but his father; and though that
    father ostentatiously avoided assuming authority over the other Brethren, it was, of
    course, none the less there. The boy seems to have despised from the first the absence of
    hierarchy among the Brethren, though at the same time they formed the most exclusive body
    on earth, being the only people that were going to heaven. There is thus an extreme
    psychological contradiction inherent in the situation. It is improbable that Alick was
    aware at the time of the real feelings which must have been implanted in him by this
    environment; but the main result was undoubtedly to stimulate his pride and ambition in a
    most unwholesome (?) degree. His social and financial position, the obvious envy of his
    associates, his undoubted personal prowess, physical and intellectual, all combined to
    make it impossible for him to be satisfied to take any place in the world but the top. The
    Plymouth Brethren refused to take any part in politics. Among them, the peer and the
    peasant met theoretically as equals, so that the social system of England was simply
    ignored. The boy could not aspire to become prime minister or even king; he was already
    apart from and beyond all that. It will be seen that as soon as he arrived at an age where
    ambitions are compelled to assume concrete form, his position became extremely difficult.
    The earth was not big enough to hold him.</p>
    <p>In looking back over his life up to May 1886, he can find little consecution and
    practically no coherence in his recollections. But from that month onwards there is
    change. It is as if the event which occurred at that time created a new faculty in his
    mind. A new factor had arisen and its name was death. He was called home from school in
    the middle of the term to attend a special prayer meeting at Redhill. His father had been
    taken ill. The local</p>
    <p>{52}</p>
    <p>doctor had sent him to see Sir James Paget, who had advised an immediate operation for
    cancer of the tongue. Brethren from far and near had been summoned to help discover the
    Lord's will in the matter. The upshot was that the operation was declined; it was decided
    to treat the disease by Count Mattei's electro-homeopathy, a now discarded system of
    unusually outrageous quackery. No doctor addicted to this form of swindling being locally
    available, The Grange was given up and a house called Glenburnie taken at Southampton.</p>
    <p>On March 5th, 1887, Edward Crowley died. The course of the disease had been practically
    painless. Only one point is of interest to our present purpose. On the night of March 5th,
    the boy --- away at school --- dreamed that his father was dead. There was no reason for
    this in the ordinary way, as the reports had been highly optimistic. The boy remembers
    that the quality of the dream was entirely different from anything that he had known. The
    news of the death did not arrive in Cambridge till the following morning. The interest of
    this fact depends on a subsequent parallel. During the years that followed, the boy ---
    and the man --- dreamed repeatedly that his mother was dead; but on the day of her death
    he --- then three thousand miles away --- had the same dream, save that it differed from
    the others by possessing this peculiar indescribable but unmistakable quality that he
    remembered in connection with the death of his father.</p>
    <p>From the moment of the funeral the boy's life entered on an entirely new phase. The
    change was radical. Within three weeks of his return to school he got into trouble for the
    first time. He does not remember for what offence<strong>5</strong>, but only that his
    punishment was diminished on account of his bereavement. This was the first symptom of a
    complete reversal of his attitude to life in every respect. It seems obvious that his
    father's death must have been causally connected with it. But even so, the events remain
    inexplicable. The conditions of his school life, for instance, can hardly have altered,
    yet his reaction to them makes it almost incredible that it was the same boy.</p>
    <p>Previous to the death of Edward Crowley, the recollections of his son, however vivid or
    detailed, appear to him strangely impersonal. In throwing back his mind to that period, he
    feels, although attention constantly elicits new facts, that he is investigating the
    behavior of somebody else. It is only from this point that he begins to think of himself
    in the first person. From this point, however, he does so; and is able to continue this
    autohagiography in a more conventional style by speaking of himself as &quot;I&quot;.</p>
