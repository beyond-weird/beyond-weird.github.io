    <p>I obtained the honour of knighthood<strong>1</strong> from one of Don Carlos'
    lieutenants. It is part of the legitimist theory that the sovereign had abrogated to
    himself the monopoly of conferring spurs, while on the other hand a woman could not confer
    knighthood. All Victorian creations are invalid.</p>
    <p>The effect of adopting the the official Anglo-German theory is even more patent today
    than in the 'nineties<strong>2</strong>. Then it was city knights; the next step was the
    matin&#130;e idol; now the pawnbroker, the movie star and the low comedian have made the
    title a badge of nastiness. There is only one honour connected with true knighthood, that
    of being a man of honour, of having taken the vows --- to uphold the right, to serve
    mankind, to protect the distressed, and generally to exercise the manly virtues. When
    renegade Jews and clowns walk in to dinner before gentlemen, the latter may prefer to go
    without.</p>
    <p>I took my admission to the Order with absolute seriousness, keeping vigil over my arms
    in a wood. The theory of the Celtic Church was that Romanism was a late heresy, or at
    least schism. The finest cathedral in the world was too small for the Church, as Brand
    found. The mountains and forests were consecrated sports. The nearest thing to a material
    house would be a hermitage such as one was likely to encounter while traveling on the
    Quest.</p>
    <p>But all these ideals, seriously as I entertained them, were in the nature of reverie.
    In practical life I was still passionately engaged in cleansing myself from the mire of
    Christianity by deliberate acts of sin and worldliness. I was so happy to be free from the
    past tyranny that I found continual joy in affirming my emancipation.</p>
    <p>There were thus several divers strands in the loom of my soul which had not yet been
    woven into a harmonious pattern. I dealt with life empirically, taking things as they
    came, without basing them on any fundamental principle.</p>
    <p>Two main events were destined to put me on the road towards myself. The first took
    place in Stockholm about midnight of December 31st, 1896. I was awakened to the knowledge
    that I possessed a magical means of becoming conscious of and satisfying a part of my
    nature which had up to that moment concealed itself from me. It was an experience of
    horror and pain, combined with a certain ghostly terror, yet at the same time it was</p>
    <p>{123}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">There is a great deal more to this story; but I may not tell it --- yet.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: Remember, this was the 1890s, not the 1990s, when most people
        will be reading this copy.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>the key to the purest and holiest spiritual ecstasy that exists. At the time, I was not
    aware of the supreme importance of the matter. It seemed to me little more than a
    development of certain magical processes with which I was already familiar. It was an
    isolated experience, not repeated until exactly twelve months later, to the minute. But
    this second occasion quickened my spirit, always with the result of &quot;loosening the
    girders of the soul&quot;, so that my animal nature stood rebuked and kept silence in the
    presence of the immanent divinity of the Holy Ghost; omnipotent, omniscient and
    omnipresent, yet blossoming in my soul as if the entire forces of the universe from all
    eternity were concentrated and made manifest in a single rose.</p>
    <p>The second event took place in October 1897. The occasion was an attack of illness. It
    was nothing very serious and I had long been accustomed to expect to die before I came of
    age. But for some reason or other I found myself forced to meditate upon the fact of
    mortality. It was impressed upon me that I hadn't a moment to lose. There was no fear of
    death or of a possible &quot;hereafter&quot;; but I was appalled by the idea of the
    futility of all human endeavour. Suppose, I said to myself, that I make a great success in
    diplomacy and become ambassador to Paris. There was no good in that --- I could not so
    much as remember the name of the ambassador a hundred years ago. Again, I wanted to be a
    great poet. Well, here I was in one of the two places in England that made a specialty of
    poets, yet only an insignificant fraction of the three thousand men in residence knew
    anything about so great a man as Aeschylus. I was not sufficiently enlightened to
    understand that the fame of the man had little or nothing to do with his real success,
    that the proof of his prowess lay in the invisible influence with he had had upon
    generations of men. My imagination went a step further. Suppose I did more than Caesar or
    Napoleon in one line, or than Homer and Shakespeare in the other --- my work would be
    automatically cancelled when the globe became uninhabitable for man.</p>
    <p>I did not go into a definite trance in this mediations; but a spiritual consciousness
    was born in me corresponding to that which characterizes the Vision of the Universal
    Sorrow, as I learnt to call it later on. In Buddhist phraesology, I perceived the First
    Noble Truth --- Sabbé Pi Dukkham --- everything is sorrow. But this perception was
    confined to the planes familiar to the normal human consciousness. The fatuity of any work
    based upon physical continuity was evident. But I had at this time no reason for supposing
    that the same criticism applied to any transcendental universe. I formulated my will
    somewhat as follows: &quot;I must find a material in which to work which is immune from
    the forces of change.&quot; I suppose that I still accepted Christian metaphysics in some
    sense or another. I had been satisfied to escape from religion to the world. I now found
    that there was no</p>
    <p>{124}</p>
    <p>satisfaction here. I was not content to be annihilated. Spiritual facts were the only
    things worth while. Brain and body were valueless except as the instruments of the soul.</p>
    <p>The ordinary materialist usually fails to recognize that only spiritual affairs count
    for anything, even in the grossest concerns of life. The facts of a murder are nothing in
    themselves; they are only adduced in order to prove felonious intent. Material welfare is
    only important as assisting men towards a consciousness of satisfaction.</p>
    <p>From the nature of things, therefore, life is a sacrament; in other words, all our acts
    are magical acts. Our spiritual consciousness acts through the will and its instruments
    upon material objects, in order to produce changes which will result in the establishment
    of the new conditions of consciousness which we wish. That is the definition of Magick.
    The obvious example of such an operation in its most symbolic and ceremonial form is the
    Mass. The will of the priest transmutes a wafer in such wise that it becomes charged with
    the divine substance in so active a form that its physical injection gives spiritual
    nourishment to the communicant. But all our actions fit this equation. A tailor with the
    toothache takes a portion of the wealth derived from the business to which he has
    consecrated himself, a symbol of his accumulated and stored energy, in order to have the
    tooth removed and so to recover the consciousness of physical well-being.</p>
    <p>Put in this way, the magical theory of existence is self-evident. I did not apprehend
    it clearly at this time; but I unconsciously acted upon it as soon as I had discovered the
    worthlessness of the world. But I was so far from perceiving that every act is magical,
    whether one likes it or not, that I supposed the escape from matter to involve a definite
    invasion of the spiritual world. Indeed, I was so far from understanding that matter was
    in its nature secondary and symbolic, that my principal preoccupation was to obtain
    first-hand sensory evidence of spiritual beings. In other words, I wanted to evoke the
    denizens of the other planes to visible and audible appearance.</p>
    <p>This resolution was the first manifestation of my true will. I had thrown myself with
    the utmost enthusiasm into various occupations from time to time, but they had never
    occupied my entire attention. I had never given myself wholly to chess, mountaineering or
    even to poetry. Now, for the first time, I felt myself prepared to expend my resources of
    every kind to attain my purpose.</p>
    <p>To me the spiritual world consisted roughly of the Trinity and their angels on the one
    side; the devil and his on the other. It is absolutely sophistical to pretend that
    Christianity is not Manichaean in essence. The Vedanta theory of Advaitism in the
    Upanishads makes evil --- and indeed all manifested existence --- Maya, pure illusion. But
    even at this, there is no satisfactory</p>
    <p>{125}</p>
    <p>explanation of the appearance of the illusion. In Christianity evil is just as real as
    good; and so long as two opposites exist they must either be equal or there must be a
    third component to balance them. Now this is in itself sophistical, for the third
    component only exists as a make- weight; and it is pure fiction to discriminate between
    two things whose only function is to counterbalance a third thing. In respect of the
    universe of discourse involved, a proposition cannot have two contradictories. If the
    opposite of good exists at all, as it must, if &quot;good&quot; is to have any meaning, it
    must be exactly equal in quantity and quality to that good. On the Christian hypothesis,
    the reality of evil makes the devil equal to God. This is the heresy of Manes, no doubt.
    But those who condemn Manes must, despite themselves, implicitly affirm his theorem.</p>
    <p>I seem to have understood this instinctively; and since I must take sides with one
    party or the other it was not difficult to make up my mind. The forces of good were those
    which had constantly oppressed me. I saw them daily destroying the happiness of my
    fellow-men. Since, therefore, it was my business to explore the spiritual world, my first
    step must be to get into personal communication with the devil. I had heard a good deal
    about this operation in a vague way; but what I wanted was a manual of technical
    instruction. I devoted myself to black magic; and the bookseller --- Deighton Bell, God
    bless 'em! --- immediately obliged with <em>The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts</em>,
    which, judging by the title, was exactly what I needed.</p>
    <p>It was with intense disappointment and distrust that I read this compilation. The
    author was a pompous, ignorant and affected dipsomaniac from America, and he treated his
    subject with the vulgarity of Jerome K. Jerome, and the beery, leering frivolity of a
    red-nosed music-hall comedian making jokes about mothers-in-law and lodgers.</p>
    <p>It was, however, clear, even from the garbled texts of the Grimoires which he quoted,
    that the diabolists had no conception of the Satan hymned by Milton and Huysmans. They
    were not protagonists in the spiritual warfare against restriction, against the oppressors
    of the human soul, the blasphemers who denied the supremacy of the will of man. They
    merely aimed at achieving contemptible or malicious results, such as preventing a huntsman
    from killing game, finding buried treasure, bewitching the neighbours' cows, or
    &quot;acquiring the affection of a judge&quot;. For all their pretended devotion to
    Lucifer or Belial, they were sincere Christians in spirit, and inferior Christians at
    that, for their methods were puerile. The prayer book, with its petitions for rain and
    success in battle, was almost preferable. The one point of superiority was nevertheless
    cardinal; their method was in intention scientific. That is, they proposed a definite
    technic by which a man could compel the powers of nature to do his bidding, no less than
    the engineer, the chemist and the electrician. There was none of</p>
    <p>{126}</p>
    <p>the wheedling, bribery and servility which is of the essence of that kind of prayer
    which seeks material gratifications. Sir J. G. Frazer has pointed out this distinction in <em>The
    Golden Bough</em>. Magic he defines as science which does not work. It would be fairer to
    state this proposition in slightly different terms: magic is science <em>in posse</em>.</p>
    <p>The compiler of <em>The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts</em> is not only the most
    ponderously platitudinous and priggishly prosaic of pretentiously pompous pork butchers of
    the language, but the most voluminously voluble. I cannot dig over the dreary deserts of
    his drivel in search of the passage which made me write to him. But it was an oracular
    obscurity which hinted that he knew of a Hidden Church withdrawn from the world in whose
    sanctuaries were preserved the true mysteries of initiation. This was one better than the
    Celtic Church; I immediately asked him for an introduction. He replied kindly and
    intelligibly, suggesting that I should read <em>The Cloud upon the Sanctuary</em> by
    Councillor von Eckartshausen. With this book I retired to Wastdale Head for the Easter
    vacation of 1898. This period proved to be the critical moment of my early life; in two
    most important respects it determined the direction of my efforts. The two were intimately
    linked in certain ways and in order to make clear my position I must retrace my steps for
    a little and bring myself up to date in the matter of climbing, as also of literature.</p>
    <p>The summers of 1896 and 1897 were spent in the Alps. They were the logical development
    of my previous experience. I had made up my mind to look for a climbing companion of a
    permanent character. I had met Professor Norman Collie in Westmorland. His teaching and
    advice were invaluable. I arranged to spend part of the summer with Morris Travers,
    Collie's demonstrator at University college, London, and a very admirable &quot;second
    man&quot; he was. A man who writes treatises on &quot;Gas Manipulation&quot; and who knows
    how to rebuff the advances of his girl students is an ideal companion on a mountain.
    Unfortunately, he obtained an appointment in a far country and had to give up climbing in
    consequence. But we made our mark in the Alps, beginning with the first guideless traverse
    of the Mönch, the Vuibez Séracs, and the first traverse of the Aiguilles Rouges,
    climbing all the pinnacles.</p>
    <p>Travers joined me for a short time in August. We began by making the first guideless
    traverse of the M&quot;nch. We started for the Guggi hut within two or three hours of his
    arrival, he having come straight through from London without breaking the journey. We
    started the next morning very early and made great speed up the lower slopes in our
    enthusiasm. Travers became extremely mountain sick. It was obvious that the barometric
    pressure had nothing to do with it; he was simply upset from the fatigue of the journey,
    the change to coarse food and the sudden call upon his full physical strength when out of
    training. Numerous other similar observations</p>
    <p>{127}</p>
    <p>prevented me from ever being so foolish as to attribute this sickness to the altitude.
    I have produced all the symptoms on Beachy Head in men who had been perfectly comfortable
    on the high Alps; and I experienced no discomfort whatever above 23,000 feet.</p>
    <p>Travers and I wandered about the Oberland for a week without going below the snow-line.
    His mountain sickness soon disappeared, but he became badly sunburnt. In those days we
    cherished the superstition that lanolin was a preventative; but the application seemed to
    feed the sores instead of healing them. A few days after leaving me he arrived at the
    Gornergrat, whither he had dispatched his baggage, in fluttering rags and with a face
    which was little better than one single suppurating sore. A lady sitting outside the hotel
    exclaimed indignantly that such disgusting objects should not be allowed to frequent
    public places. It was his mother!</p>
    <p>Taking of sunburn, there was once --- improbable as it may appear --- a Dr. Bowles, of
    Folkestone, interested in the subject. He arranged with Morris Travers to carry out a
    research on the actinic value of the solar rays on glaciers. Travers and I and his brother
    went to live in a hut on a glacier somewhere above Bel Alp, where Travers was to carry out
    some experiments. One day there arrived Bowles and a number of voluntary victims, each
    member of the party having his face painted with grease paint of divers colours, the right
    half vermilion and the left sky-blue, or the left bright green and the right orange, and
    so on. I record, with regret, that I, who had refused to abdicate the dignity of humanity
    to this extent, was the only person in the party who was not badly burnt. The sun showed
    no respect to persons in the matter of their camouflage. My freedom was due to the fact
    that I had spent most of my life in the open air and gradually acquired immunity. It
    sometimes strikes me that the whole of science is a piece of impudence: that nature can
    afford to ignore our impertinent interference. If our monkey mischief should ever reach
    the point of blowing up the earth by decomposing an atom, and even annihilate the sun
    himself, I cannot really suppose that the universe would turn a hair. If we are ever to do
    anything, it can only be by the manipulation of those spiritual forces which lie behind
    the consciousness of which the universe of matter is but a symbolic phantasm.</p>
    <p>The second of these exploits --- the Vuibez Séracs -- constituted one of the most
    interesting ice climbs that I had ever done. They had not been climbed for a generation,
    when the glacier was in a very different condition, and were reputed impossible. Jean
    Ma&#140;tre, who was supposed to be the best guide in the valley, with other strong guides
    and some distinguished members of the Alpine Club, decided to attempt it. They returned
    with a wonderful story of desperate adventure. They had been stopped, they said, by the
    final obstacle, an overhanging ice wall guarded by a wide crevasse. This interested</p>
    <p>{128}</p>
    <p>us. We set out the following morning, reaching the obstacle without any difficulty,
    which gave us a poor idea of the capacity of the mighty men of valour. But we could not be
    surprised at their failure to negotiate the obstacle. We found ourselves standing on a
    knife-edge separated from the overhanging wall by a crevasse so broad that we could only
    just reach it with our axes. Travers held me on the rope while I leant across and cut a
    ledge in the wall which could be used for his hands. Having anchored him to his brother
    lower down, I lowered him cautiously so that he was able to lean across with his hands on
    the ledge, thus forming a bridge. I then climbed, in my crampons, on to his shoulders and
    stood there for forty minutes while I cut hand and foot holds in the overhanging ice.
    Trusting myself to these, Travers was hastily pulled back to the vertical by his brother.
    In this position he was able to support my weight on his uplifted axe-head sufficiently to
    allow me to use one hand. In this way I cut fresh hand holds in the overhanging wall and
    ultimately pulled myself over the edge. There was still some step-cutting to be done
    before I got to a sufficiently good place to pull up the others. I have never seen the
    performance of Travers equalled on any occasion. Hastings himself could hardly have been
    more strong, steady and enduring, to say nothing of the qualities required to allow a man
    to stand on his head and shoulders with sharp spikes!</p>
    <p>We now found that so far from this obstacle being the last, it was the first! I take a
    good deal of credit to myself for finding the way to the top through the tangled pinnacles
    of ice. I began to be not a little alarmed; the s&#130;racs stretched line after line
    above us. There was no way of getting out of them and at any moment the sun might strike
    the glacier and overthrow their pride and our temerity. We climbed with desperate haste
    and managed to reach the snow-covered glacier above them just in time. As it happened, a
    party had gone out from the hotel after breakfast with the idea of watching us from the
    opposite slopes and they told us next evening that our tracks had been obliterated in a
    dozen places by falling ice.</p>
