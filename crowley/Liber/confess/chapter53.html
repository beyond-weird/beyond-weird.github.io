    <p>I had been so concentrated on Kangchenjunga that the other facts of my life had not
    glittered perceptibly. They had kept up with me, but I hardly knew it. They were now to
    shine, the bushel of Kangchenjunga having been rudely removed.</p>
    <p>My instinct against <em>The Book of the Law</em> had apparently had its way. It was as
    if the events of eighteen months before had never taken place. I was going on with Magick
    on the old lines, without any particular aqmbition, but quietly exercising the powers
    already obtained. For instance, I had established regular communications with Soror F.
    (Soror Fidelis --- Mrs. Elaine Simpson). We had long interviews, visiting each other
    alternately. I was a little better than she was, but her body was quite material enough to
    impress all the senses.</p>
    <p>It occurs to me that I ought to give further details. Our astral bodies, as we had got
    them, were replicas of our physical bodies, save that they were slightly larger. Hers, for
    example, was just over sic feet high instead of five feet seven inches. The body was
    self-luminous and partially transparent, so that I could see the background behind her,
    much as through a muslin curtain. The substance of the body appeared homogeneous. It was
    usually clothed and crowned. The materials were of the same quality of matter as the body,
    but could be distinguished from flesh by such optical devices as colour and reflections.
    We moved according to the laws of the astral plane; that is, without making the normal
    physical actions, though we were able to use our limbs in the ordinary way. We
    communicated, sometimes by audible speech, sometimes by direct transmission of thought
    such as occurs every day in ordinary life, when one knows what a friend is going to say
    before he says it.</p>
    <p>One very curious phenomenon must be recorded. In the early days we had arranged special
    hours for our interviews by calculating the difference of time due to longitude. We now
    summoned each other by means of the astral bell. But on comparison of our records we
    discovered an astounding fact. Although we agreed about the character of the interview,
    the subject of conversation etc., we found that the time did not necessarily correspond.
    That is: suppose I went to see her at midnight on Friday (India), she did not see me at
    four a.m. on Saturday (England) but at some other time which might be later or earlier. I
    could easily imagine a delay in my appearance, but it seemed to me nonsense that I should
    have arrived before I started! At that time I understood little of the nature of time.</p>
    <p>{445}</p>
    <p>My lyric gift had begun to sit up and take notice a little after the shock of the
    realization of all its aspirations. I had begun to write again. Some of my poems at this
    period were definitely rationalistic. I was already aware that the rationalist position
    was wooden and shallow. The members of the Rationalist Press Association were no less
    narrow-minded sectarians than the Evangelicals. They had the same suburban point of view,
    the same prudish exclusiveness; they were shocked by any fact which did not immediately
    fit into their framework, and angrily denied its existence.</p>
    <p>I was shifting slowly back to Buddhism; though even more impatient than before of
    Buddhists, their parochial morality and their emphasis on the evils of existence. But I
    wrote a few lyrics about love and nature which are still among my best. I may mention
    &quot;The Song&quot;.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Dance a measure<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>Of the tiniest whirls!<br>
          Shake out your treasure<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>Of cinnamon curls!<br>
          Tremble with pleasure<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>O wonder of girls!<br>
          Rest is bliss,<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>And bliss is rest,<br>
          Give me a kiss<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>If you love me best!<br>
          Hold me like this<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>With my hand on your breast!</p>

    <p>There was also &quot;Said&quot;, inspired by my week in Cairo: &quot;Patchouli&quot;, a
    shot of rhapsody upon African and Asiatic themes; &quot;The Jilt&quot;, a piece of
    sadistic exultation over my wife's cruelty to Howell, who we heard was stricken to the
    heart by the thunderbolt of her marriage. Then there was &quot;The Eyes of Pharaoh&quot;,
    a terrific presentation of the mystery of Egypt, and &quot;Benzai&quot;, a poem in praise
    of Japan, then at was with Russia. There was a new note in my work: that of humour.
    &quot;The Beauty and the Bikkhu&quot; is a versification of a Buddhist legend. The
    original is unconsciously funny, and I brought this out, while preserving the sublimity of
    the story. Again &quot;Immortality&quot; develops an idea in the <em>Gorgias</em> of Plato
    that after death one goes on doing very much what one did before. The style is at once
    passionate, pictorial, and terrifying and witty.</p>
    <p>Another new string to my lyre; I had been reproaching myself for my ignorance of the
    Sufi doctrines, and intended to cross Persia on my way back to England. For this purpose I
    began to study the language with a munshi. I began to imitate the poets of Iran. &quot;Ali
    and Hassan&quot; is a paraphrase from Alf Laylah Wa Laylah. &quot;Al Malik&quot; is a
    ghazal; that is, a series of couplets</p>
    <p>{446}</p>
    <p>with a monorime. The first two lines and each successive even line rime with each
    other. In Darjeeling (on my return) I had had a brief but intense liaison with a Napali
    girl, Tenbuft. I celebrated this passion in a rondel &quot;Tarshitering&quot;.</p>
    <p align="center">NEPALI LOVE SONG</p>
    <p>O kissable Tarshitering! The wild bird calls its mate --- and I?<br>
    Come to my tent this night of May, and cuddle close and crown me king!<br>
    Drink, drink or fill of love at last -- a little while and we shall die,<br>
    O kissable Tarshitering!</p>
    <p>Droop the long lashes; close the eyes with eyelids like beetle's wing! Light the slow
    smile, ephemeral as ever a painted butterfly, Certain to close into a kiss, certain to
    fasten on me and sting!</p>
    <p>Nay? Are you coy? hen I will catch your hips and hold you wild and shy Until your very
    struggles set your velvet buttocks all a-sqing, Until their music lulls you to
    unfathomable ecstasy, O kissible Tarshitering!</p>
    <p>I must explain that oriental modesty does not allow the selfrespecting poet to
    introduce the name of a woman, just as in Shakespeare's time it was considered scandalous
    for a woman to appear on the stage. I respected this convention and replaced the name of
    Tenguft by a male name, which I thought euphonious and suitable to my scheme of time and
    scansion.</p>
    <p>Moharbhanj was an ideal place for meditation. I had absolute leisure, I was at the top
    of my form physically and every other way, and I could not start anything serious until my
    wife and child arrived, which they did not do until October 29th. I was in a wild district
    with no one to talk to; it afforded the maximum opportunity for taking stock of my life,
    finding out what the past meant and taking aim for the future.</p>
    <p>The Durga Puja was in course. I was able to appreciate the enthusiasm of the aboriginal
    Hindu much better than I could have done in Calcutta, where the corrosion of civilization
    has eaten into primitive practice.</p>
    <p>Moharbhanj, though only thirteen hours from Calcutta, is as far from it morally as it
    is from London. The people were unspoilt. For the first time I liked Hindus. The maharajah
    was away for the day. He had sent his Minister of Public works to meet me and entertain me
    until his return. This gentleman, whose name was Martin, had taken a high degree at
    Oxford, and had studied science and engineering very thoroughly. No one could have
    suspected that he had a Bengali grandmother. But in the first twenty-four hours I had
    discovered the truth of the aphorism &quot;Blood will tell&quot;. For all his European
    education, he believed in the most primitive superstitions, from ghosts and witches to
    mysterious medicines.</p>
    <p>{447}</p>
    <p>The next day the maharajah returned. I found him an extremely interesting and
    delightful companion. One could hardly expect less from the direct descendant of a
    peacock. I am sorry to say that he did not take his ancestry seriously. He had exchanged
    his illusions for another set far less fascinating, far less inspiring and equally absurd.
    He believed in Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill. One of his stories is extremely
    instructive. If it were graven upon the eye-corners, it would be a warning to such as
    would be warned! There are no principles of politics, economics and the rest; it is all
    balderdash. More, it is a damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion to apply the theories
    of the Thames valley to the practice of the Coromandel coast.</p>
    <p>Moharbhanj is a province on the sea-board of Orissa. In my wanderings I came to a range
    of hills of unparalleled wonder. It was between ten and twenty miles in length, and some
    three thousand feet high. The marvel of it is that it is composed very largely of pure
    iron pyrites, whose bare outcrop forms huge rounded bosses. I first saw these hills at
    sunset, and they glowed with crimson splendour too vivid to be merely mineral. It was like
    blood on a bull's shoulder in the sunlight. The maharajah knew the commercial value of his
    mountains, but he had no coal; to exploit his treasure he needed a light railway from the
    mountains to the sea.</p>
    <p>When he came to the throne he nobly determined to confer the benefits of liberal
    principles upon his people. Now he was not only the Maharajah of Moharbhanj, but its
    zemindar or landlord. He wished to create a peasantry of prosperous and independent
    freeholders. He understood that it would be fatal to make them a present of the land; so
    he made a law by which any man who cultivated his land continuously for fifteen years
    would at the end of that time become its owner. As is generally known, the greatest pride
    of the Hindu is to make his daughter's wedding as splendiferous as possible. For this
    purpose he will get himself into debt for generations ahead as recklessly as the most
    progressive nation will do for their own pet phantom of glory.</p>
    <p>So as soon as the new law was proclaimed, the Marwaris descended upon Moharbhanj like
    locusts, and advanced sums beyond the wildest imaginations of the peasants, to them. The
    marriages were magnificent; so were the mortgages. At the end of fifteen years the land
    belonged not to the cultivator but to the alien usurer. The maharajah could not even see
    that he had ruined himself and his subjects. He told me with honest pride, &quot;I have
    conferred great benefit upon my people.&quot; Yet he was in a comical state of distress
    because the Marwaris refused to grant him the concession to build the light railway so
    that he could melt up his mountains! In the meanwhile the people were poorer than before,
    though the administration of his revenues by the British had increased his personal income
    from three to eighteen lakhs of rupees in less than twenty years.</p>
    <p>He told me one enthralling story about his raj. A great deal of it is</p>
    <p>{448}</p>
    <p>unexplored and impenetrable jungle. In the clearing are villages inhabited by very
    primitive folk of a different race to the bulk of the population. I saw a good deal of
    these people. They go in many cases naked. At the most, they wear a rudimentary loin
    cloth. They have a language of their own which possesses a few affinities with outer
    dialects. It possesses less than three hundred words, some two hundred and fifty of which
    are classed as obscene. The men are armed with bows and arrows, or occasionally spears,
    some of which show great skill of metallurgy and workmanship as well as a knowledge of
    certain branches of mechanics, and a marked sense of beauty.</p>
    <p>The women are free from the ordinary Hindu inhibitions, and their breasts are the most
    beautiful that I have ever seen, not excepting those of the women ofTehuantepec. They are
    small and well proportioned. Even when the women are mothers, they do not lose their form.
    The whole breast stands firm and points upwards. To the eye of the artist, the female
    breast of the European is a hideous deformity. Even in the case of the most beautiful
    women, it breaks the line of the body, and it makes one think of a cow. But these women
    bear their breasts in triumph. One thinks of the phallophorus in a pagan procession.</p>
    <p>Men and women alike are admirably proportioned, muscular and active. Their habit of
    carrying loads on the head --- a coolie carries thirty pounds, which, considering the heat
    of the plains, is equivalent to the fifty pounds of the hillman --- gives them perfect
    balance and makes them light on their feet. The skin is of that superb velvety black with
    is really rich deep purple. Primitive as these people are, they are as capable of
    aesthetics and the popes and princes of the Renaissance. They love with rapacious
    intensity, adorned with all the arts of Aphrodite.</p>
    <p>These folk are considered &quot;wild men of the woods&quot; by the sophisticated Hindus
    of the town. Yet there is a third proportional.</p>
    <p>In the jungle live people known as Jewans, whom I hesitate to describe as a tribe,
    because nothing is known of their habits. Even their appearance has not been
    satisfactorily described. It is said by some that no white man has ever seen one, though
    others say that one or two have done so. Even the folk of the villages on the confines of
    the jungle have no knowledge of them, yet they carry on with them a regular traffic.</p>
    <p>Certain places outside the village are marked out, usually by white stones, and here
    they deposit rice and other products of cultivation at nightfall. In the morning these
    goods are found to have been replaced by various products of the jungle. It is said that
    this commerce has never been degraded by dishonesty. Attempts have been made to catch the
    Jewans in the act of making the exchange, but they have always proved too wary.</p>
    <p>The maharajah did not shoot, but appointed a forest officer named d'Elbroux to
    introduce me to the bears and tigers. The only animal I was</p>
    <p>{449}</p>
    <p>not allowed to shoot was the elephant. One has to be a viceroy or a travelling royalty
    to indulge in that sport. D'Elbroux, in his youth, had come to grips with a bear. He had
    been very badly mauled, and many of his features had been replaced by metal plates. He
    told me that he had lain in the jungle wounded for more than two days before help arrived.</p>
    <p>My only noteworthy shooting adventure was this. D'Elbroux had prepared a machan. There
    were some seven hundred beaters. The first animal that broke was a bear, whom I settled
    with a shot from the 10-bore. The second barrel jarred off and the surprise knocked me on
    my back. The bullet struck a tree as thick as a telegraph pole, and cut it in two, so that
    it fell across the machan and very nearly killed one of the men.</p>
    <p>My best memory of Moharbhanj is not of tigers and such small fowl, but of elephants,
    which I was not allowed to shoot. I have always felt that my life has numerous points of
    contact with <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and I now come to the incident, &quot;The
    Elephants did tease so!&quot;</p>
    <p>I went out one night to a bhul, or salt lick, in a tree overlooking which a machan had
    been built for me. A particularly fine tiger was reputed to visit the place every night. I
    took up my vigil immediately after dinner. A three-quarter moon was due to rise about
    half-past eight. We kept extremely quiet, of course. I dislike shooting from a machan,
    exactly as I dislike coarse fishing. One cannot do anything to help things along. On the
    contrary, one has to avoid the slightest action.</p>
    <p>The waiting sounds as if it might be good practice for meditation. I found it quite the
    opposite, for the object of one's vigil is itself a distraction, and if one concentrated
    on the sport, it would of course disappear, as had already happened to my nose and my
    navel. Soon after dark I began to hear the noises of the jungle, from the rustling of
    leaves and grasses as small animals moved cautiously about their business to the distant
    roaring of the tiger. Once or twice a shadowy shape made the darkness that brooded over
    the salt lick deeper, but there was no sense in risking a shot till moonrise. I could
    hardly see my own hands, much less the sights of my rifle.</p>
    <p>When the moon rose at last, the few animals that had arrived vanished with equal
    stealth. There was a great silence in the jungle and the roars of the tigers (there were
    several all round the compass) became less frequent and less near.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden I became aware of a tremendous disturbance. It was not exactly a noise
    --- I'm inclined to think that it may have been a smell. I cannot say definitely more than
    this, that I had the impression that something enormous was going on.</p>
    <p>I had been lying flat in the machan, listening. I raised my head cautiously. The
    silvern glades were now mysteriously peopled with gigantic shapes. It was a herd of
    elephants! I counted twenty-four of them. My shikari whispered</p>
    <p>{450}</p>
    <p>that there would be no shooting that night; no other animals would venture into the
    neighbourhood of the master of the jungle. I realized, moreover, that my position was one
    of extreme danger. The machan was high from the ground; but had the elephants winded me
    and taken alarm, my tree would have snapped like a twig. But I had no time to think of
    danger; I was thrilled with exaltation. I sat up and spent the night watching the
    elephants as they went about their business. It was the most fascinating vision that had
    ever been vouchsafed to me on the material plane.</p>
    <p>I did not grudge the loss of my night's sport. I was not really very keen about the
    shooting. I was in a very curious frame of mind. I loved to wake at dawn on my camp bed
    and meditate and read Kant, Berkeley and Firdausi. Persian fascinated me more than any
    other language had ever done and I revelled in the ideas of the Sufis. Their esoteric
    symbolism delighted me beyond measure. I took it into my head to go one better than my
    previous performance in the way of inventing poets and their productions.</p>
    <p>I spent most of my time writing ghazals, purporting to be by a certain Abdullah al Haji
    (Haji, with a soft &quot;h&quot;, satirist, as opposed to Haji with a hard &quot;h&quot;,
    pilgrim) of Shiraz. I caused him to flourish about 1600 A.D., but gave to the collection
    of his ghazals the title <em>Bagh-i-Muattar</em> (<em>The Scented Garden</em>), which
    implies the date 1905, the value of the Arabic letters of the title adding up to the
    equivalent o hat year of the Hegira. I also invented an Anglo Indian major to find,
    translate and annotate the manuscript, an editor to complete the work of that gallant
    soldier (killed in South Africa) and a Christian clergyman to discuss the matter of the
    poem from the peculiar point of view of high Anglicanism.</p>
    <p>The ghazals themselves are rendered sometimes in the supposed original monorime,
    sometimes in prose, and the annotations contain a great deal of the more esoteric
    information about the East, which I had picked up from time to time. It is especially to
    be noted that, although I have packed every kind of magical and mystical lore into the
    volume, there is nowhere any reference to <em>The Book of the Law</em>. I was setting my
    whole strength against the Secret Chiefs. I was trying to forget the whole business.</p>
    <p>The book itself is a complete treatise on mysticism, expressed in the symbolism
    prescribed by Persian piety. It describes the relations of God and man, explains how the
    latter falls from his essential innocence by allowing himself to be deceived by the
    illusion of matter. His religion cease to be real and become formal; he falls into sin and
    suffers the penalty thereof. God prepares the pathway of regeneration and brings him
    through shame and sorrow to repentance, thus preparing the mystical union which restores
    man to his original privileges, free will, immortality, the preception of truth and so on.</p>
    <p>I put the last ounce of myself into this book. My previous efforts in the</p>
    <p>{451}</p>
    <p>same direction would have deceived nobody, but the <em>Bagh-i-Muatar</em>, despite my
    inability to produce the Persian original --- my excuse was that it was rare and held the
    most sacred and most secret, but was being copied for me --- persuaded even experienced
    scholars that it was genuine. It was issued by Probsthain &amp; Co., by private
    subscription, in 1910. I have heard of a copy changing hands at fifty guineas.</p>
    <p>This spurt of genius is an eloquent portrait of my mind at this time. I was absolutely
    convinced of the supreme importance of devoting my life to attaining Samadhi, conscious
    communion with the Immanent Soul of the Universe. I believed in mysticism. I understood
    perfectly the essence of its method and the import of its attainment, but I felt compelled
    to express myself in a satirical and (it might appear to some) almost scandalous form. I
    testified to the tremendous truth by piling fiction upon fiction. I did not know it. I did
    not suspect it, but the <em>Bagh-i-Muattar</em> is a symptom of supreme significance. I
    was on the brink of a totally new development.</p>
    <p>On Sunday, October 22nd, I had an astral interview with Soror F. which brought my up
    with a shock. She was accompanied by a golden hawk, in whom I later recognized one of the
    Secret Chiefs of the A.'. A.'.. The conversation turned on the subject of the Great Work.
    It was defined as the creation of a new universe. The interview left me spiritually
    prostrate. I had been perfectly happy with my programme, doing a little work there and a
    little there; Magick on Monday and teaching on Tuesday, so to speak; advising any
    applicant that approached me; editing and publishing any documents that fell into my
    hands.</p>
    <p>But the Secret Chiefs were determined not to allow me to fool myself. When they picked
    me out o do their work they meant me to get busy and do it, and were going to see that I
    did. They did not insist on my taking up the work of the New Aeon. They knew their
    business too well. They knew that I should not be ready until I had undergone the proper
    preparation. They were content therefore with stirring me up to tackle the problem of my
    relations with the universe as seriously as the Buddha had done twenty-five centuries
    before.</p>
    <p>I rode into Moharbhanj hardly aware of my surroundings. I was criticizing myself with
    ruthless severity. I do not remember whether <em>The Book of the Law</em> so much as
    crossed my mind. If so, I must have put it angrily aside. All I did know was that I should
    not have a moment's peace again until I had solved the great problem and I had no idea how
    to tackle it. I began to set my ideas in order.</p>
    <p>Returned again to Calcutta. One day I went over to Kalighat and sacrificed a goat to a
    goddess. That night I was sitting alone reading. She appeared to me and inspired me to
    write a poem to her. I quote the first two stanzas:</p>
    <p>{452}</p>
    <p align="center">KALI</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There is an idol in my house<br>
          By whom the sandal always steams.<br>
          Alone, I make a black carouse<br>
          With her to dominate my dreams.<br>
          With skulls and knives she keeps control<br>
          (O Mother Kali!) of my soul.</p>
          <p>She is crowned with emeralds like leaves,<br>
          and rubies flame from either eye;<br>
          A rose upon her bosom heaves,<br>
          Turquois and Lapis Lazuli.<br>
          She hath a kirtle like a maid ---<br>
          Amethyst, amber, pearl, and jade!</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This poem is important as foreshadowing my final solution of the problem of evil and
    sorrow, the interpretation of illusion by the initiate and its transmutation into truth.</p>
    <p>I saw as usual a good deal of Thornton. One morning, driving down the Maidan in his
    tum-tum, I said, &quot;I cannot formulate a plan of action of any kind because there is no
    true continuity in phenomena.&quot; He turned on my quite simply, and said, &quot;Quite
    so, but there is equally no continuity in yourself.&quot; That, of course, was no news to
    me. It was Hume's answer to Berkeley, for one thing. It was the essence ofSakkaya-Ditthi,
    for another. The ground was cut away from under my feet. At the moment, my consciousness
    failed to pick up the full purport of this proposition, for I found myself suddenly forced
    into action by a set of circumstances of which I had no control, and which bore no
    relation to any past purpose of my life. But I believe they were arranged for me by the
    Secret Chiefs.</p>
    <p>My wife was due to arrive with the baby on the twenty-ninth and the natural thing would
    have been to see a little of Calcutta society, especially as I was naturally a bit of a
    lion, and then stroll across Asia somewhere, at our leisure. The Secret Chiefs arranged
    for me to be in a situation where I was at their mercy. They meant to initiate me whether
    I liked it or not. And this is how they went to work.</p>
    <p>I set forth after dinner, one fate-fraught night, to try to get unguided to a street of
    infamy called &quot;Culinga Bazar&quot; from the corner of the Maidan. It was a worthy
    feat to attempt; for I had been to the Bazar only once before, in 1901; and then I had
    been driven to it in the dark from afar distant part of Calcutta. The night was extremely
    dark; the streets were lighted only by the flares and fireworks of the native festival ---
    the Durga-Puja --- which was in</p>
    <p>{453}</p>
    <p>course, and all semblance of honesty or decency quitted the houses before I had
    advanced three minutes into the bowels of Calcutta.</p>
    <p>As I did so, my savage instincts surged to my brain. I &quot;smelt&quot; the direction
    almost at once; and as I got into this state, I became aware of impending trouble of some
    sort, as savages are. That &quot;eerie feeling&quot;, alone in a desperate section of a
    foreign city at night? Nine to one it is plain funk. But as I had already admitted, I am
    the biggest coward alive; and I have constantly forced myself to face my fear. So not I
    was not tingling with the pleasurable sense of confronting the unknown; I had the definite
    sense of being trailed. The sensation angered me; I tried to ascribe it to imagination. I
    forgot it and I went my way.</p>
    <p>Presently, however, I turned aside for a moment from the dim street I was treading into
    an alley guarded by a black archway. I had no idea where it might lead; I simply wished to
    withdraw from the observation of my fellows for a few seconds, for reasons which are fully
    described and justified in Carpenter's <em>Physiology</em>.</p>
    <p>I passed through the archway. It was as &quot;dark as the pit&quot;. (I don't know what
    pit may be meant.) The alley beyond was somewhat lighter; the sky loomed dull blue-grey
    above.</p>
    <p>I noticed various doorways in the walls; also one at the end of the alley; I was in a
    cul-de-sac. And then I saw, faint glimpses in the gloom, the waving white of native robes.
    Men were approaching me and I was aware --- through hardly by sight --- that they moved in
    a semi-military order, in single file. There was noting to alarm me in this it is the
    habit of natives to march thus. And yet I was pungently aware that some evil was meant. As
    it happened, I was dressed in dark clothes and my face burnt deep brown. I effaced myself
    against the wall.</p>
    <p>Three of the men passed me; then they turned. I was surrounded. Strong hands gripped my
    arms; greedy hands sought my pockets. I barked out sharp orders: they should have no doubt
    that I was a sahib. For all answer I saw the pallid gleam of a knife.</p>
    <p>I must really break off to say that I have always found the psychology of this incident
    enthralling. It stands out in my memory in <em>alto-relievo</em>.</p>
    <p>I have never on any other occasion had so much time to think --- I am afraid I express
    it badly. I mean that I was acutely conscious of a few well-marked thoughts, without the
    usual gradations, sub-thoughts, connections and so forth, that make it hard --- in
    ordinary life --- to discriminate between conscious and unconscious thought.</p>
    <p>On this night I was as primitive as an ape. My thoughts stand out stark as stars on a
    background of utter blackness. I had become, as by an enchanter's spell, the primeval
    caveman. Perhaps the long strain and horror of the Kangchenjunga tragedy had prepared me
    for this sudden outcropping of atavism.</p>
    <p>{454}</p>
    <p>However that might be, I remember nothing but these harsh clear thoughts, uninterfered
    with by the usual mental processes. I felt myself a &quot;hum,an leopard&quot;; something
    in me warned me that --- contrary to all common sense and evidence --- I had lured these
    men. I was, so to say, a Q-ship! I remember the resistance of my civilized self to this
    insane idea; I was an English gentleman, attacked without provocation by a band of common
    robbers.</p>
    <p>I had given the order that they should unhand me; they had disobeyed a sahib; my life
    was in danger. This being the case, I was right to act in selfdefence. I would press the
    trigger of the Webley on which my forefinger had rested since the first glimpse of white
    robes in the alley. I did so. There was a slight click.</p>
    <p>Now, my Webley holds five cartridges; I invariably keep the hammer down on an empty
    chamber. The chamber will only revolve freely when the gun is at half-cock. Therefore,
    thought I, &quot;with omnipotence at my command and eternity at my disposal&quot; I must
    have been fiddling unconsciously with the weapon, set it at half-cock and twiddled the
    chamber round until the hammer was down, not on the empty space, but on the cartridge next
    to it, so that the gun, in cocking itself under trigger-opressure, had dropped the hammer
    on the void. True; but then, to correct the error, it was only necessary to press the
    trigger a second time.</p>
    <p>I have purposely described these thoughts in detail, to emphasize the fact that my mind
    was working in a more leisurely manner than I had ever known it to do. It is all the more
    amazing to reflect that my whole train of thought, except the final detail, what to do
    next, was totally inaccurate!</p>
    <p>I pressed the trigger again. My arms were held firmly to my sides, but even so I was
    too economically minded to fire through my pocket; I managed to raise the muzzle above the
    edge.</p>
    <p>A violent explosion followed.</p>
    <p>I had fired without aim, in pitch blackness; I could not even see the white robes of
    the men who held me. In the lightning moment of the flash I saw only that whitnesses were
    falling backwards away from me, as if I had upset a screen by accident.</p>
    <p>The blackness which followed the flash was Cimmerian. My eyes are naturally very slow
    to accommodate themselves to change of illumination --- I have never met any man equally
    helpless in case of sudden diminution of light. I had no thought soever as to whether my
    shot might have hit anybody. There was not the faintest sound; but the alley seemed
    somehow empty. I do not know whether I stepped over fallen bodies or not. (I was facing
    the archway when I fired.)</p>
    <p>I thought: I will get out of this alley at once. Those people may be lying in ambush in
    the archway, especially as I do not know whether there are doors opening out of it or not.
    I will keep my forefinger on the trigger and</p>
    <p>{455}</p>
    <p>at the same time light a match to make sure of the archway. When I get out into the
    open street, I will walk away very quickly and very quietly, and go straight to the
    Dharamtolla road and take a gharry, and drive to Edward thornton and tell him what has
    happened.</p>
    <p>I carried out this programme to the letter.</p>
    <p>And now comes a curious circumstance. Me experiments in Mexico City in &quot;making
    myself invisible&quot; have been recorded with considerable detail; and it will be
    remembered that I was far from satisfied with the results. I had reached the
    &quot;flickering&quot; condition, but I had never succeeded in &quot;putting myself
    out&quot; completely.</p>
    <p>But on this occasion --- when my unconscious self seems to have had me in hand
    throughout --- I made myself invisible right enought. The report of the pistol, the
    screams (for all I know!) of the wounded or frightened men, and the alarm given by the
    fugitives, had aroused the entire district. An European was a rare bird in that quarter at
    that time of night; and no native would be likely to have such a gun. No doubt, too, the
    whole assault had been watched from the beginning; and I must have been denounced
    descriptively. I remember clearly enough noting with a type of amusement which I must
    really admit to having something &quot;devilish&quot; in its composition, that the streets
    through which I passed were filled with wildly excited crowds, all looking for me.
    &quot;But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.&quot; I am aware that this
    sounds like a fish story. But as a matter of fact people who lived with me for the last
    three years or so have noticed that I make myself invisible quite frequently, and that
    (apparently) when I am not aware that I am doing so.</p>
    <p>There is a peculiar type of self-absorption which makes it impossible for people to be
    aware of one. In these recent cases, the observer who could see me quite plainly because
    in sympathy with me, could also see that the other people in the street --- or wherever it
    was --- could not see me at all. My theory is that the mental state in question distracts
    people's attention from one automatically, as a conjurer does deliberately. I can transfer
    this property of invisibility, however, even to inanimate objects. For instance, a police
    officer recently came to my house in search of a certain thing which he named. I admitted
    that I possessed it; I showed it to him; I insisted on his seeing, smelling, tasting and
    touching it; but he left the house and reported that he had been unable to find it. In
    this particular instance I knew what I was doing. I deliberately overwhelmed his mind with
    my earnestness in helping him and other objects of thought. I cut the connecting link
    between his senses and his mind.</p>
    <p>But we digress. I enjoyed lazily the splendour of the drowsy night as I jogged along
    with lighted pipe --- never tobacco tasted better --- in the broken-down old gharry up to
    Thornton's.</p>
    <p>{456}</p>
    <p>I had good reason to be proud. I had been the butt of every gully at school, I had
    suffered the agonies of knowing myself a coward and a weakling. My whole life seemed at
    times to be one vast and slimy subterfuge to cozen death.</p>
    <p>Yet in the past month there had been a dozen outrages upon Europeans in Calcutta, some
    of them culminating in the most brutal murder. And I was the only Englishman who had come
    out on top. I had lost four rupees, eight annas, it is true; but I had won the victory,
    one against six.</p>
    <p>Thornton was in bed when I arrived; but I had not hesitation in making his
    &quot;bera&quot; admit me. I told him my story and opened my revolver. Then only did I
    discover that my elaborate course of reasoning was entirely at fault! I had NOT monkeyed
    with the weapon and the hammer HAD been down on the empty chamber as was right. What had
    happened was that the first cartridge had failed to explode; for there was the dent in the
    cap; once again had nature, simple and sufficient, mocked the pomposity of the human
    intelligence!</p>
    <p>Now, concluded I, hadn't I better go to the police and have these ruffians rounded up?
    Thornton was half asleep, but his mocking eye expressed a more than godlike pity for my
    idiocy. &quot;Go to bed,&quot; he murmured in his dreams; &quot;come round after Chota
    Hazri in the morning and I'll take you to the right man.&quot; My indignation subsided. I
    agreed. I withdrew. I slept. I bathed. I breakfasted. I went to Thornton.</p>
    <p>Thornton took me to a Scottish solicitor named MacNair. I brought out my indignation,
    its hair nicely brushed, and parted exactly in the middle. MacNair remembered what his
    ancestors (who, at the time of the Flood, had a boat of their ain) thought about caution.
    &quot;Go to Garth,&quot; was his considered opinion. Garth was one of the most brilliant
    barristers in Calcutta. I brought out my indignation again, but its hair got slightly
    ruffled, and I am not sure but what there was a speck of dust on its collar. I protested
    violently that I wanted to go to the police.</p>
    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Garth, &quot;Curzon and Fraser are busy with the partition of
    Bengal, for reasons of purely administrative convenience; and it is singularly unfortunate
    that the measure will break the political power of the Bengali into a lot of dirty little
    bits. Their hearts bleed for Bengal. So, if you should have happened to hit somebody last
    night, they will be very indignant and bring you to trial. You will be instantly
    acquitted, but they will invent some scheme for having you tried again, and acquitted
    again, to show the sincerity of their love for the Bengali, whom they are out to
    smash.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Then you advise me,&quot; I said innocently, &quot;to say nothing?&quot;
    &quot;Indeed no,&quot; he said tempestuously, &quot;as a sworn barrister, it is my duty to
    advise you to report the whole affair immediately to the police.&quot; I became more
    innocent that ever. &quot;Well, I don't see how I can throw any light on the matter. (I
    was still ignorant of the effect, if any, of the shot.)</p>
    <p>{457}</p>
    <p>He bellowed with laughter. &quot;You can throw a whole flood of light on it,&quot; he
    shouted. My Quaker ancestors knocked at the door of my dull mind, I suppose. &quot;Would
    you do it yourself?&quot; I asked meekly. &quot;Well,: he said more soberly, &quot;you'd
    be acquitted of course. A man doesn't stroll out after dinner to murder strangers. But
    you'd be kept hanging about Calcutta indefinitely; and an unscrupulous man, I'm afraid,
    might be tempted to hold his tongue and clear our of British India p.d.q.&quot;</p>
    <p>My Quaker ancestors told me what to do. I said sternly, but sadly, &quot;then I suppose
    it is my duty to go to the police at once. Where is my gharry?&quot; The great barrister
    wrong my hand in silent sympathy.</p>
    <p>But it has been one of the guiding principles of my life never to go into a game unless
    there is a sporting chance. It is silly to be tried for murder if there is no possibility
    of conviction. All the bubbles are gone from the champagne. So I waited two days more,
    still unaware whether my shot had told, and went to meet my wife and child at the wharf.</p>
    <p>&quot;How are you?&quot; she exclaimed dramatically. My prosaic reply was, &quot;You've
    got here just in time to see me hanged!&quot;</p>
    <p>Thornton gave a dinner party in our honour that night. My wife sat at his right hand. I
    saw that she was upset about something. I had no opportunity to talk to Thornon alone
    before dinner. He kept on giving a curious gesture and then raising two fingers. My stupid
    mind could not imagine what he was driving at. After dinner he took me and Rose aside for
    a moment. The unimaginable had happened. My single shot had gone clean through the abdomen
    of the man with the knife and lodged in the spine of the villain behind him. They had been
    taken to hospital and made a full confession of their crime.</p>
    <p>So the next morning the <em>Standard</em> gave me my meed of publicity. Column three of
    the main page gave the story of the attempted robbery. The man with the gun was thought to
    be a sailor from one of the ships in the harbour; the police offered a reward for his
    apprehension. Column five contained an interview with the hero of the expedition to
    Kangchenjunga. &quot;They will go round the ships,&quot; said Thornton, &quot;and they
    they'll have a shot at the hotels. Get out and get out quick!&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Darling sweetheart lovey-dovey silly great big she-ass!&quot; I whispered to my
    wife, &quot;would you rather walk across Persia or across China?&quot;</p>
    <p>The wretched woman knew no geography. All she knew about Persia was rugs and Omar
    Khayyam; all she knew about China was opium smoking, porcelain and tea. She was fed up
    with Omar, who was at that time deplorably the rage in this wasp-witted country. &quot;My
    ownest own,&quot; she purred, &quot;let's go through China!&quot; We hastily engaged an
    ayah for our baby. This female was hideous, ill-mannered and untrustworthy; she claimed to
    be a Roman Catholic so as to conceal that her caste would have nothing to do with her,</p>
    <p>{458}</p>
    <p>but she was the only ayah available, so off we went. The one honest human being in the
    party was dear old shikari Salama Tantra. The loyal staunch old hound! He never flinched,
    he never failed; he had all the innocence of a child and all the wisdom of Pythagoras; the
    courage to face the unknown --- which Indians almost always fear to the limit --- and the
    gentleness which goes with great strength of body and soul. Peace be to thee, old friend,
    where'er thou be.</p>
