    <p>Meanwhile my magical condition was making me curiously uncomfortable. I was succeeding
    beyond all my expectations. In the dry pure air of Mexico, with its spiritual energy
    unexhausted and uncontaminated as it is in cities, it was astonishingly easy to produce
    satisfactory results. But my very success somehow disheartened me. I was getting what I
    thought I wanted and the attainment itself taught me that I wanted something entirely
    different. What that might be it did not say. My distress became acute; and, as I had done
    at the beginning, I sent out an urgent call for help from the Masters. It must have been
    heard at once, for little over a fortnight later I got a long letter from Fra. V.N. Though
    I had not written to him, he gave me the very word that I needed. It restore my courage
    and my confidence. I continued my work with deeper and truer understanding. I began to
    perceive the real implications of what I was doing. In particular, I gained an entirely
    new grip of the Cabbala.</p>
    <p>One of my results demands detailed record, because it proved later to be one of the
    foundations of the Great Work of my life. The word Abracadabra is familiar to everyone.
    Why should it possess such a reputation? Eliphas Lévi's explanations left me cold. I
    began to suspect that it must be a corruption of some true &quot;word of power&quot;. I
    investigated it by means of the Cabbala. I restored its true spelling. Analysis showed it
    to be indeed the essential formula of the Great Work. It showed who to unite the Macrocosm
    with the Microcosm. I, therefore, adopted this word and its numerical value, 418, as the
    quintessentialized expression of the proper way to conduct all major Magical Operations.</p>
    <p>This discovery was only one of many. Before Allan
    Bennett</a> left for Ceylon, he gave me most of his magical notebooks. One of these
    contained the beginnings of a Cabbalistic dictionary in which various sacred words were
    entered, not alphabetically, but according to their numerical value. I must explain that
    the fundamental idea of the Cabbala is that the universe may be regarded as an elaboration
    of the numbers from 0 to 10, arranged in a certain geometrical design and connected by
    twenty-two &quot;paths&quot;.<strong>1</strong> The problem is to acquire perfect
    comprehension of the essential nature of these numbers. Every phenomenon, every idea, may
    be referred to one or more numbers. Each is thus, so to say, a particular modification of
    the pure idea. Sacred words which add up to any number should be eloquent commentaries on
    one of its aspects. Thus the number 13 proves to be, as it were, an essay</p>
    <p>{212}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: This refers to the &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, a method of
        literary criticism which has generalized itself to become a map of human consciousness. It
        is not and never has been &quot;the fundamental idea of the Cabbalah,&quot; but it is one
        of the most useful conceptions to emerge from that very diverse mystical complex.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>on the number 1. The words &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;love&quot;<strong>1</strong>
    both add up to 13. These ideas are therefore qualities of 1. Now, 26 combines the idea of
    duality, which is the condition of manifestation or consciousness, with this 13; and we
    find, accordingly, that 26 is the value of the name Jehovah. From this we see Him as the
    Demiourgos, the manifestation in form of the primordial <em>One</em>.</p>
    <p>For many years I worked on these lines continually, adding to Allan's nucleus, and
    ultimately making a systematic compilation. The resulting book was published in <em>The
    Equinox</em>, vol. I., no. VIII. It is the only dictionary of the Cabbala in existence
    that can claim any degree of completeness. Since its publication, of course, new knowledge
    has come to light and I hope to issue a revised edition in course of time. As it stands,
    however, it is the essential book of reference for the student. It can never be complete;
    for one thing, every student must create his own Cabbala. My conception, for instance, of
    the number 6 will not be identical to yours. The difference between you and me is, in
    fact, just this; you are capable of perceiving one set of aspects of absolute reality, I
    another. The higher our attainment, the more closely will our points of view coalesce,
    just as a great English and a great French historian will have more ideas in common about
    Napoleon Bonaparte than a Devonshire and a Provinçal peasant. But there will always be
    more in any being than any man can know.</p>
    <p>My magical work was pushed into the background by the arrival of Eckenstein. He openly
    jeered at me for wasting my time on such rubbish. He being brutally outspoken, and I shy
    and sensitive, I naturally avoided creating opportunities for him to indulge his coarse
    ribaldry on a subject which to me was supremely sacred. Occasionally, however, I would
    take advantage of his unintelligence by talking to him in terms which I knew he would not
    understand. I find that it relieves my mind and helps me to clarify my thoughts if I
    inflict my jargon on some harmless stranger haphazard. As will be told in due course,
    Eckenstein and I made a very thorough exploration of the mountains of Mexico. During this
    time, my magical distress again increased. I could not relieve it by the narcotic of
    preparing and performing actual ceremonies, of silencing the voice of the demons by
    absorption in active work. It was while we were preparing our expedition to Colima that I
    broke out one evening and told Eckenstein my troubles, as I had done often enough before
    with no result beyond an insult or a sneer. Balaam could not have been more surprised when
    his ass began to prophesy that I was when, at the end of my outburst, Eckenstein turned on
    me and gave me the worst quarter of an hour of my life. He summed up my magical situation
    and told me that my troubles were due to my inability to control my thoughts. He said:
    &quot;Give up your Magick, with all its romantic fascinations and deceitful delights,
    Promise to do this for a </p>
    <p>{213}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: In the Hebrew language.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>time and I will teach you how to master your mind.&quot; He spoke with the absolute
    authority which comes from profound and perfect knowledge. And, as I sat and listened, I
    found my faith fixed by the force of facts. I wondered and worshipped. I thought of Easter
    '98, when I wandered in Wastdale in despair and cried to the universe for someone to teach
    me the truth, when my imagination was impotent to forge the least link with any helper.
    Yet at that very hour, sitting and smoking by the fire opposite me, or roped to me on a
    precipice, was the very man I needed, had I but had the intuition to divine his presence!</p>
    <p>I agreed at once to his proposals and he taught me the principles of concentration. I
    was to practise visualizing simple objects; and when I had succeeded in keeping these
    fairly steady, to try moving objects, such as a pendulum. The first difficulty is to
    overcome the tendency of an object to change its shape, size, position, colour, and so on.
    With moving objects, the trouble is that they try to behave in an erratic manner. The
    pendulum wants to change its rate, the extent of its swing or the plane in which it
    travels.</p>
    <p>There were also practices in which I had to imagine certain sounds, scents, tastes and
    tactile sensations. Having covered this ground-work to his satisfaction, he allowed me to
    begin to visualize human figures. He told me that the human figure acts differently from
    any other object. &quot;No one has ever managed to keep absolutely still.&quot; There is
    also a definite test of success in this practice. The image should resolve itself into
    two; a smaller and a larger superimposed. It is said that by this means one can
    investigate the character of the person of whom one is thinking. The image assumes a
    symbolic form, significant of its owner's moral and intellectual qualities.</p>
    <p>I practised these things with great assiduity; in fact, Eckenstein put the brake on.
    One must not overstrain the mind. Under his careful tuition, I obtained great success.
    There is no doubt that these months of steady scientific work, unspoiled by my romantic
    fancies, laid the basis of a sound magical and mystic technique. Eckenstein evidently
    understood what I was later to learn from <em>The Book of the Law</em>: &quot;For pure
    will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.<strong>1</strong>&quot;</p>
    <p>During this time we were busy with expeditions. Eckenstein had already been to the
    Himalayas (in 1892); he wanted to complete my education by experience of mountains higher
    than the Alps, and travel in rough country among primitive people. We began by
    establishing a camp on Iztaccihuatl, at about fourteen thousand feet. We remained there
    for a matter of three weeks and climbed this, the most beautiful mountain in Mexico, from
    every possible side. In doing so, we incidentally broke several world's records.</p>
    <p>Our difficulties were in some ways severe. The canned food procurable in Mexico City
    was of inferior quality and many years old at that. Eckenstein</p>
    <p>{214}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH Note: AL I,44</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>was constantly ill with diarrhea and I was not much better. Finally food gave out
    altogether and our last three days we had literally nothing but champagne and Danish
    butter. We didn't care much; we had done what we had set out to do. Besides, I had learnt
    a great deal about camp life, the fine points of glissading, and the use of Steigeisen. In
    1899, at the Montanvers, I had already found that his mechanically perfect
    &quot;claws&quot; worked miracles. We had shown a young man for Oxford, Dr. T. G.
    Longstaff, of what they were capable. Eckenstein would walk on a measured slope of over
    seventy degrees of hard black ice without cutting a step. On slopes up to fifty degrees he
    could simply stroll about. Nor could Longstaff pull him off by the rope.</p>
    <p>On the grand scale, too, I had proved their possibilities. One day, Eckenstein being
    ill, I had arranged to go with Longstaff and his two guides over the Col du Géant. Not
    feeling very fit myself, I thought I would start an hour ahead of the others. Having
    inspected the ice fall, I found a way straight up. When I was about half way through the
    s&#130;racs, I heard Longstaff's guides yelling blue murder. I had taken the
    &quot;wrong&quot; way. Their route involved a detour of a mile or more. I took not notice
    of their friendly anxiety and reached the top a long way in advance. When they arrived,
    they explained that what I had done was impossible. To carry on the joke, when we got back
    I offered a hundred and fifty francs to any party that would repeat the climb by my route.
    Nobody did so.</p>
    <p>It is really astonishing and distressing that (after all these years of proof that men
    with proper claws are to men without them as a rifleman to an archer) English climbers are
    still quite ignorant of what claws can do, or how to use them. In Mr. Harold Raeburn's
    book he argues amiable against them. He admits that one can walk up hard snow at easy
    angles without steps, but fears to do so lest, returning later in the day, he should find
    the snow soft, and then where would he be without a staircase? He seems to have no idea
    that the supreme use of claws is on ice and that the harder the ice the surer the hold.
    Yet Mr. Raeburn pits himself against Everest, where claws would convert the most perilous
    passages into promenades, and ice slopes whose length an steepness make step-cutting
    impracticable into serenely simple staircases. The policy of boycotting Eckenstein and his
    school, of deliberately ignoring the achievements of Continental climbers, to say nothing
    of my own expeditions, has preserved the privilege and prestige of the English Alpine
    Club. Ignorance and incompetence are unassailable. Ridicule does not reach the realms of
    secure snobbery. The mountains themselves vainly maim and murder the meddlers; they merely
    clamour all the more conceitedly to be considered heroes. It is one of the most curious
    characteristics of the English that they set such store by courage as to esteem a man the
    more highly the more blindly he blunders into disaster.</p>
    <p>{215}</p>
    <p>We thought it rather unfair to take cove against Boer marksmanship; we are still proud
    of being unprepared in the Great War. We doubt whether science is sportsmanlike; and so it
    is thought rotten bad form to point out how mismanagement smashed Scott's expedition. No
    gentleman criticizes the conduct of the campaign of Gallipoli.</p>
    <p>In March 1922 I heard of the composition and projects of the Everest expedition. I
    wrote an article predicting failure and disaster, giving my reasons and showing how to
    avoid the smash. No one would print it. I was told it was the the thing to
    &quot;crab&quot; these gallant gentlemen. No. But should my prophecies come true, then was
    the time to explain why. What I had foretold came to pass precisely as I had predicted it.
    But I was still unable to get a hearing. Why add to the tribulations of these heroes by
    showing up their stupidity? Besides, England had failed --- better not talk about it at
    all.</p>
    <p>On Iztaccihuatl, on off days, we had a lot of practice with rifles and revolvers. At
    that altitude and in that clear air one's shooting becomes superb. We found we could do at
    a hundred yards better than we had ever done before at twenty-five. We used to knock the
    bottoms out of bottles, end-on, without breaking the necks. In Mexico we used to make
    rather a point of practising with firearms whenever we struck a new district. A reputation
    for expertness is the best protection against local marauders.</p>
    <p>For instance. We once fell in with a party of railway engineers, one short. The
    absentee had strolled out after dinner to enjoy the cool of the air. He was found in the
    morning naked, with a machete wound in the back. He had been treacherously murdered for
    the value of a suit worth, at the outside, five shillings.</p>
    <p>When we retuned to Amecameca, we went at once to pay our respects to the Jefe Politico,
    to ask him to dinner to celebrate our triumph. He had been very kind and useful in helping
    us to make various arrangements. When he saw us he assumed an air of sympathetic
    melancholy. We wondered what it could mean. By degrees he brought himself to break to us
    gently the terrible news. Queen Victoria was dead! To the amazement of the worthy mayor,
    we broke into shouts of joy and an impromptu war dance.</p>
    <p>I think this incident rather important. In reading Mr. Lytton Strachey's <em>Eminent
    Victorians</em>, and still more his <em>Queen Victoria</em>, as also in discussing periods
    with the younger generation, I find total failure to appreciate the attitude of artists
    and advanced thinkers who remember her jubilee. They cannot realize that to us Victoria
    was sheer suffocation. While she lived it would be impossible to tale a single step in any
    direction. She was a huge and heavy fog; we could not see, we could not breathe. Under
    her, England had advanced automatically to prosperity. Science too had surged up from
    sporadic spurts into a system. And yet, somehow or other, the spirit of her age had killed
    everything we cared for. Smug, sleek, superficial, servile,</p>
    <p>{216}</p>
    <p>snobbish, sentimental shopkeeping had spread everywhere. Even Darwinism had become
    respectable. Even Bradlaugh had been accepted. James Thomson had been starved and classed
    with the classics. Swinburne had been whacked and washed and brushed and turned into a
    model boy. The Church of England had collapsed under the combined assault of rationalism
    and Rome; yet, deprived of its religious element, and torn from its historical
    justification, it persisted placidly. The soul of England was stagnant, stupefied! Nothing
    remained for which a man might be willing either to live or to die. Huxley, Manning,
    Booth, Blavatsky, Ray Lankester --- it mattered nothing what they said and did, all were
    equally stifled in shapeless sacks, stowed away indistinguishably, their voices mingled in
    the murmur of polite society.</p>
    <p>It is hard to say why Queen Victoria should have seemed the symbol of this
    extraordinary state of suspended animation. Yet there was something in her physical
    appearance and her moral character which pointed to her as the perfect image of this
    inhibiting idea. The new generation, seeing their predecessors in perspective, perceive
    the individual qualities of each. There is nothing to tell them that in those days each
    one of us seethed with impotent rage at our doom. We were all damned with faint praise.
    Sir Richard Burton was toned down into a famous traveller and translator; Gordon
    sentimentalized into a warrior saint; Hardy was accepted as the Homer of Wessex; Meredith
    patted on the back as the modern Ovid. It was impossible to dynamite the morass of
    mediocrity. Progress was impossible. The most revolutionary proposals, the most
    blasphemous theories, lost their sting. A sovereign of suit, a parliament of putty, an
    aristocracy of alabaster, an intelligentsia of india-rubber, a proletariat of pulp; it was
    impossible to shape such material. The strongest impression was blunted by the inertia of
    the viscous glue which resisted nothing, but resumed its formlessness as soon as the
    immediate impulse of the impact was spent.</p>
    <p>England had become a hausfrau's idea of heaven, and the empire an eternal Earl's Court
    exhibition. This was the real reason why people who loved England, like Tom Broadbent in <em>John
    Bull's Other Island</em>, used to indulge in spasms of glee whenever we happened to have a
    corporal's file ambushed by some horde of savages<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>Our next expedition was to the Colima District. The mountain is here divided into two
    very distinct sections; one is snow-clad, the other one of the most frequently active
    volcanoes in the world. Going over the shoulder of the Nevado, we emerged from a forest to
    get our first view of the Volcan, some twelve miles away. As we watched, an eruption
    occurred. The wind was blowing towards us and the next thing we knew was that falling
    ashes were burning little holes in our clothes. We began to suspect that the ascent</p>
    <p>{217}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">P.S. --- And in 1929 I find myself rather regretting those &quot;spacious
        days&quot;!</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>might be troublesome. We settled the Nevado straight off. The climbing is of little
    interest and no difficulty. Then we camped on a spur for a week, and took turns, day and
    night, to watch the behaviour of the volcano. The inspection was disappointing; we could
    not discover any periodicity in the explosions; we could simply take our chance. We
    started accordingly; but, finding our feet beginning to burn through our boots, decided to
    retire gracefully.</p>
    <p>Our third objective was Toluca. Here we had two delightful days. For some reason or
    other we had not brought the tent and slept in the crater in our ponchos. In the morning I
    found myself about three inches thick in hoarfrost. On the first day we climbed what was
    apparently the highest summit. (The formation is that of the rim of an enormous crater.)
    When we got there we found that another point a long way off was higher. The next morning
    Eckenstein was sick and I had to go alone. There was some difficult rock climbing on the
    wall which led to the ridge. But once there, the summit was easily reached. There are many
    magnificent teeth, which I climbed conscientiously; a most exhilarating exercise. I
    traversed some distance till I found a gap on the other ridge from which I could run down
    to the crater. We went down to the plateau the same day and returned to the city.</p>
    <p>On this excursion we met a man who said he had seen with his own eyes the famous
    phantom city. This yarn has for me a peculiar fascination. I am not sure that I do not
    believe that in some sense it is true, thought it would be hard to say in exactly what
    sense. I heard the story at least a dozen times; twice first-hand from serious informants.
    The story varies but slightly and only in unimportant details.</p>
    <p>It general tenor is this: A man on horseback, sometimes a solitary prospector,
    sometimes a member of a party temporarily separated from the rest, but always alone, loses
    his way in hilly wooded country. (The district varies considerably with the narrator, but
    as a rule is somewhere within a couple of hundred miles of Mexico City, the direction
    being between north-west and south-west.) The horseman is eager to find a way out of the
    forest, so that he may take his bearings. It is getting late; he does not want to camp out
    if he can help it. At last he sees the trees thinning out; he hurries forward and finds
    himself on the brink of the hillside. At this moment darkness falls suddenly. It is
    impossible to proceed. Then he sees on the hillside opposite, possibly two or three miles
    distant, a city gleaming white. It is not a large city by modern standards, but it is an
    important city. For its size, it is very bravely built. The architecture does not suggest
    a modern city; I have heard it described as &quot;like an Arabian Nights city&quot;,
    &quot;like an old Greek city&quot;, &quot;like an Aztec city&quot;. The traveller proposes
    to himself to visit it in the morning. But when he wakes there is not trace of it. There
    is not even any distinguishing</p>
    <p>{218}</p>
    <p>character about the hillside where he saw it which might have suggested the idea of a
    city to a tired man. In some cases lights are seen in the city; occasionally there is even
    the sound of revelry.</p>
    <p>Talking of liars! We suddenly discovered that we were regarded in the light ourselves.
    I suppose it is the abject ignorance and narrow outlook of ordinary people that makes them
    sceptical about anything out of the common. However, that may be, a paragraph appeared in
    the Mexican <em>Herald</em> which indirectly threw doubt on our expeditions. It was
    particularly pointless; we had published noting, made no claims, behaved in fact exactly
    as we should have done in the Alps. But Eckenstein was annoyed at the impertinence and
    proposed to take summary vengeance. He accordingly went down to the low bar frequented by
    the peccant reporter, bought him a few drinks, congratulated him on his literary style,
    and politely regretted that he should have been led into error by ignorance of his
    subject.</p>
    <p>The reporter was far from sure that the conversation would not suddenly by a bullet
    being put through him, for Eckenstein always looked a very formidable customer; but he
    found himself charmingly invited to come with us and climb Popocatapetl, so as to acquire
    first-hand knowledge of mountains and the men who climbed them. He gaily and gratefully
    accepted this insidious proposition. We rode merrily up to the sulphur ranch, where
    intending climbers stay the night. The next morning the fun began. One of the world's
    records which we had left in tatters was that for pace uphill at great heights. Long
    before we got to the lowest point of the rim of the crater our sceptical friend found that
    he couldn't go another yard --- he had to turn back. We assured him that the case was
    common, but could easily be met by use of the rope. So we tied him securely to the middle;
    Eckenstein set a fierce pace up hill, while I assisted his tugging by prodding the
    recalcitrant reporter with my axe. He exhausted the gamut of supplication. We replied only
    by cheerful and encouraging exhortations, and by increased efforts. We never checked our
    rush till we stood on the summit. It was probably the first time that it had ever been
    climbed in an unbroken sprint. Our victim was by this time convinced that we could climb
    mountains. And he was certainly the sorriest sight!</p>
    <p>Even on the descent, his troubles were not over. Most of the lower slopes are covered
    with fine loose ash, abominable to ascend but a joy to glissade. Our friend, between the
    fear of God, the fear of death, and the fear of us, had lost all mastery of his emotions.
    We had taken the rope off and shot down the slopes to show him how to do it, but he was in
    mortal terror. The felling that the ground was slipping under his feed drove him almost
    insane. I hardly know how he got down to us at last, except that on those loose slopes he
    could hardly help it. Having put our man through the mill, we became seriously friendly.
    He took his lesson like a good sportsman and made his</p>
    <p>{219}</p>
    <p>apologies in the Mexican <em>Herald</em>, by writing a long account of his adventure in
    the style of the then famous Mr. Dooley.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein and I lived in an American apartment house, from the roof of which one could
    see a great distance down a principal thoroughfare.</p>
    <p>Eckenstein used to lure people to discuss eyesight and mention that mine was miraculous
    for distant objects. It would by arrange for me to drop in at this stage, accidentally on
    purpose, and then Eckenstein would offer to prove his tall stories on the spot. So we
    would go up to the roof with field glasses and I would describe distant objects in great
    detail, read names on shops a quarter of a mile off, etc. etc. The victim would check this
    through the field glasses, confirming my accuracy. No one ever suspected that this stunt
    had been prepared by my using the field glasses and learning the scenery by heart!</p>
    <p>I should have mentioned a short excursion which I took to Vera Cruz. My ostensible
    object was to see some cases of yellow fever. As a matter of fact, I was horribly afraid
    of the disease. So I picked an occasion when the port had shown a clean bill of health for
    the previous three weeks. I had an introduction to a local doctor and told him how sorry I
    was not to be able to see any cases. &quot;Well, well,&quot; said he, &quot;come round to
    the hospital tomorrow morning anyhow --- some points may be of interest.&quot; And then I
    found any amount of yellow Jack, mendaciously diagnosed as malaria, typhoid, etc., in the
    hope of throwing dust in the eyes of the United States inspectors and getting them to
    remove the quarantine.</p>
    <p>The journey from Vera Cruz back to the city is to my mind the finest in the world from
    the point of view of spectacular effect; the second best is from the Ganges up to
    Darjeeling. For the first forty miles one runs through tropical jungle, then the track
    suddenly begins to mount and wind its way among the sub-alpine gorges, with the whole
    eighteen thousand feet of Citlaltepetl towering above. The scenery continually changes in
    character as one ascends, and then quite suddenly one comes out on the plateau, a level
    vastness almost desert save from cactus and aloe, with the two cones of Istaccihuatl and
    Popocatapetl sticking out of it.</p>
    <p>We had intended to finish our programme by climbing Citlatepetl; but there were
    difficulties about mules and none about the mountain. We were too bored to trouble to
    climb it. Somehow or other, the current of our enthusiasm had become exhausted. We had
    achieved all our real objects and the next thing was to get ready for the Himalayas.
    Eckenstein returned to England and on the twentieth of April I started for San Francisco,
    westward bound. My objective was a curious one. Since leaving England, I had thought over
    the question of the authority of Mathers with ever increasing discomfort. He had outraged
    every principle of probity and probability; but he was justified, provided that his
    primary postulate held good. I could think</p>
    <p>{220}</p>
    <p>of only one way of putting him to the test. It concerned an episode at which Allan Bennett</a> was present. Allan, and he alone, could
    confirm the account which Mathers had given me. If he did so, Mathers was vindicated; if
    not, it was fatal to his claims. It seems absurd to travel eight thousand miles to ask one
    question --- a childish question into the bargain! --- but that was what I did. The sequel
    will be told in the proper place.</p>
