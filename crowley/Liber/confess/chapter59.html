    <p>I left Shanghai on the twenty-first of April. On the twenty-second I was sick and
    stayed in bed all day. I did no regular invocation, but thought over the recent crisis. I
    dismissed the Shanghai experience as a morbid dream. Reading through the above record at
    this distance of time, after deliberately avoiding doing so for so long, I feel very
    uncertain about it; I feel that there was a great deal of genuine communication with the
    right people and that the Oracle is confused, contradictory and uneven, because of the
    interference of our personalities.</p>
    <p>There was the question of our love affair. I was absolutely in love with Rose in the
    ordinary sense of the term. My love for Fidelis excluded the material almost entirely. I
    was very proud of my love for Rose and very happy in it. The one thing I feel sure of is
    this: that we had a superb opportunity to take up the Great Work together and that we
    missed it on account of our determination to see things with our own eyes. We were, no
    doubt, quite ready to put the Great Work first, last and all the time; but we were
    hampered in doing so by our settled conviction as to what the Great Work might imply. For
    my part, at least, I know that I was always arguing that such and such a course couldn't
    be right on general principles, as I had done when Rose herself had told me how to invoke
    Horus; and I had not learned the lesson that my idea of &quot;general Principles&quot; was
    not reliable.</p>
    <p>The entry of April 24th shows how admirably the gods arrange one's affairs. One may
    have a perfectly right idea, but as long as one holds to it they will take pains to upset
    the apple cart: abandon the idea, and they immediately hand it back with a charming
    compliment. This is the lesson of the Book of Job.</p>
    <p>I quote the entry in full, concealing only the name of the Order.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At Kobe. A.'. fair only; though I invoked all these powers of mine. Yet after, by a
      strong effort of will, I banished my sore throat and my surroundings, and went up in my
      Body of Light. Reached a room in which a cruciform table was spread, a naked man being
      nailed thereto. Many venerable men sat around, feasting on his living flesh and quaffing
      his hot blood. These (I was told) were the adepts, whom I might one day join. This I
      understood to mean that I should get the power of taking only spiritual nourishment ---
      but probably it means much more than this.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Next I came into an apparently empty hall, of white ivory worked in</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{525}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>filigree. A square slim altar was in the midst, I was questioned as to what I would
      sacrifice on that altar. I offered all save my will to know A.'. which I would only change
      for its own realization. I now became conscious of god-forms of Egypt sitting, so vast
      that I could only see to their knees. &quot;Would not knowledge of the gods suffice?&quot;
      &quot;No!&quot; said I. It was then pointed out to me that I was being critical, even
      rationalistic, and made to see that A.'. was not necessarily fashioned in my image. I
      asked pardon for my blindness, and knelt at the altar, placing my hands upon it, right
      over left. Then, one, human, white, self-shining (my idea after all!) came forth and put
      his hands over mine, saying: &quot;I receive thee into the Order of ---.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I came back to earth in a cradle of flame.</p>
    <p>I was thus formally received among the Secret Chiefs of the Third Order on the astral
    plane. It was the natural sequel to the passage of the Abyss. I was careful not to presume
    on a mere vision. Superb as the experience was, I would not allow it to turn my head. I am
    almost morbidly sensitive about my responsibility in such matters. No more fatal mistake
    can be made than to grasp after a grade. Attainment is an appalling danger if one is not
    perfectly fitted for it at every point. One must search oneself unsparingly for weak
    spots; the smallest scratch suffices to admit a germ of disease and one may perish
    altogether through a moment's carelessness. It is unpardonably foolhardy to take a chance
    in matters of such serious import.</p>
    <p>I took the vision to heart as a lesson.<br>
    I next day's entry makes this clear.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Yesterday's vision a real illumination, since it showed me an obvious mistake which I
      had utterly failed to see. The word in my Kamma work (in Burma) was <em>Augoeides</em>, (a
      subsequent entry implies that the word was &quot;given&quot; me directly from the unseen
      world) and the method <em>Invoking Often</em>. Therefore a self-glittering One, whether my
      conscience approves on not, whether my desires fit or not, is to be my guide. I am to <em>invoke
      often</em>, not to criticize. Am I to lose my grade of Babe of the Abyss? I cannot go
      wrong, for I am the chosen one; that is the very postulate of the whole work. This boat
      carries Caesar and his fortunes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is here an implication, perhaps, that I had been compelled to accept the Cairo
    working. This is confirmed by the entry of April 30th:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>(It has struck me --- in connection with reading Blake --- that Aiwass, etc.,
      &quot;Force and Fire&quot; is the very thing I lack. My &quot;conscience&quot; is really
      an obstacle and a delusion, being a survival of heredity and education. Certainly to rely
      on it as an abiding principle in itself is wrong. The one really important thing is the
      fundamental hypothesis: I am the</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{536}</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Chosen one. All methods will do, if I only <em>invoke often</em> and stick to it.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I resented intensely being told that I was &quot;the Chosen One&quot;. It is such an
    obvious man-trap; it is the commonest delusion of the maniac and, in one form or another,
    the essence of all delusions. Luckily, there is an answer to this. What can be more really
    arrogant than assuming that one has been singled out for &quot;strong delusion&quot;? I
    had received some very remarkable evidence in quite unexpected quarters that I was singled
    out to accomplish the Great Work of emancipating mankind.</p>
    <p>One of these is so intensely interesting on its own accord that I must not omit it,
    quite apart from its bearing on the question of my destiny. One morning I had sat down to
    rest and smoke a pipe on the top of a little pass in warm misty weather. Salama came and
    sat down by my side. I looked at him in amazement. It was an astounding breach of
    etiquette. I have often wondered if he did it deliberately, as if to say, &quot;I am not
    your headman: I am a messenger of the gods.&quot; He began, however, in a very shamefaced,
    sheepish way, obviously embarrassed. It was as if he had been thrust by surprise into the
    position of an ambassador. &quot;Sahib,&quot; he said, &quot;last night I had a <em>tamasha</em>.&quot;
    I reproached him laughingly. <em>Tamasha</em> means an entertainment of any kind, and, in
    the East, frequently implies a certain amount of liveliness, possibly an indulgence in
    forbidden liquor and flirtation; but he merely meant a dream. The usual words for dream
    are <em>khwab</em>, <em>roya</em>, <em>wahm</em>. Evidently he wished to imply that his
    dream was not an ordinary one, that it was a genuine vision. (I forgot to ask him whether
    he was awake or asleep.)</p>
    <p>He proceeded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I was on the shore of a small lake. It was a wild country and the lake was surrounded
      by tall reeds, some of them growing in the water. The full moon was high in the sky, but
      there were clouds and mist. You were standing in front of me, sahib; quite motionless,
      lost in thought, as you always are, but you seemed to be waiting for someone. Now there
      was a rustling in the reeds, and out of them came a boat rowed by two beautiful women with
      long fair hair, and in the front of the boat stood another woman, taller and fairer even
      than her sisters. The boat came slowly across to you; and then I saw that the woman held
      in her hands a great sword, long and straight, with a straight crosshilt which was heavy
      with rubies, emeralds and sapphires. She put this sword into your hands and you took it,
      but nothing was said. They went away as they had come, into the fringe of reeds across the
      lake. And that was all I saw.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I remained unable to reply. At this time I was the last man in the world to take
    anything of the sort seriously; more I was resolved not to do so even</p>
    <p>{527}</p>
    <p>at the cost of restraining the theory of sensory hallucination. What struck me dumb was
    hearing an old shikari tell the story of Excalibur in language so near to that of Malory
    as to make no odds. Could one of his sahibs have told him the tale long ago, so that it
    popped up in this strange fashion with me as the hearer? I had no doubt whatever of the
    man's sincerity and truthfulness and he had no motive for inventing anything of the sort.</p>
    <p>I cannot believe it a coincidence; I really wondered whether the most reasonable
    hypothesis is not that Aiwass, wanting to remind me that I was chosen to do the Great
    Work, picked out, on the one hand, Salama as the most unlikely prophet imaginable; on the
    other, the tale as one which I could not possibly dismiss as trivial. In fact, though I
    cannot remember making a record of the incident, and indeed probably took pains to avoid
    doing so as a rebuke to self-importance, it remains as vivid and distinct as almost
    anything else in my life. I can see the pass, I can almost taste the tobacco: I can see
    his shy honest weather-beaten old face and hear his timid loyal accents. In the background
    the coolies, singing and talking, pass over the misty slopes; yet I cannot remember where
    the place was or even whether it happened on the first or second Himalayan expedition<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>I continued the Invocation of the Augoeides, with occasional additions and progressive
    intensification, week after week. I rather avoided any other magical work, on the
    principle of concentrating every particle of my energy on the daily routine. I even
    refrained, as a rule, from using my astral eyes during the Invocation itself. I might
    easily have been lured from the Path by getting interested in some of the hosts of angelic
    forms that habitually appeared.</p>
    <p>On May the fourth there is an entry which indicates my attitude to the work itself. It
    sounds very simple to make an invocation; but when one gets to work, behold! a multitude
    of points, each of which has to be settled with extreme care. This entry deals with one
    such:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A.'. very energetic on my part, intensely so, better perhaps than ever before.</p>
      <p>However (or perhaps because) there was little vision.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this work of A.'. requires the adept to assume the woman's part; to long for
      the bridegroom, maybe, and to be ever ready to receive his kiss; but not to pursue openly
      and to use force.</p>
      <p>Yet &quot;the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
      force.&quot; May it not be, though, that such violence should be used against oneself in
      order to attain that passive state? And, of course, to shut out all rivals? Help me, thou
      Holy One, even in this; for all my strength is weak as water, and I am but a dog. Help me.
      O self-glittering one!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>{528}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">I am almost sure, on reflection, that it was on the return from
        Kangchenjunga.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>draw nigh to me in sleep and in waking, and let me ever be as a wise virgin and expect
      thy coming with a lamp of oil of holiness and beauty! Hail, beautiful and strong one! I
      desire thy kisses more than life or death.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>From this it appears that I was still as spiritually adolescent as St. Augustine or St.
    Teresa. It seems necessary for juvenile souls to represent mystical experience by means of
    anthropomorphic symbols. The practice naturally follows the lines laid down by the theory.
    For this reason one's early adventures are accompanied by romantic phenomena and stigmata.
    Buddhist psychology recognizes this. For instance, the first Jhana is accompanied by
    Ananda, bliss; but in the second this quality disappears. I think it deplorable that
    mystic advancement should be expressed by means of such hieroglyphs as &quot;the Bride's
    Reception&quot;; that is, at least, if any peculiar attribution of a sexual character is
    implied.</p>
    <p>Of course, even above the Abyss, Chokmah and Binah, Chiah and Neschamah are customarily
    called Father and Mother; considering how lamentably prone humanity is to
    anthropomorphism, it seems unfortunate. But we cannot deny the justice of the symbolism,
    and the way to eliminate the disadvantages and dangers of the situation is to extend the
    connection of the word &quot;love&quot; to include all phenomena of the uniting of
    opposites, as is done in <em>The Book of the Law</em>. Hardly anything is more important
    for the aspirant than to get rid of the tendency to make God in his Own image. One should
    learn to regard the formula of Yod, Hé, Vau as universal, not as generalized from the
    reproductive process of mammals, but <em>vice versa</em>. That process should be regarded
    as one particular case of the Law, and that case by no means an important one.</p>
    <p>We must be constantly on our guard against egocentric implications; they do not even
    exalt the ego as they pretend to do, they limit it. We become great just so far as we are
    able to liberate ourselves from the constriction of our normal conception that we are man.
    When one has crossed the Abyss, especially, one should be altogether free from the
    prepossession that one's body and mind are more than inconvenient instruments through
    which we perceive the universe. To increase our understanding of the cosmos, we must
    constantly endeavour to counteract the limitations which the fact that our instrument is a
    human being seeks to impose upon us.</p>
    <p>I do not, however, wish to represent the Operation of Abra-Melin which I was now
    performing as a retrogression; but I had to undertake it in order to fulfil completely the
    formulae of adeptship. It was necessary to complete the work of he Second Order before I
    could adequately take up my work in the Third. Again, the mission, in order to carry out
    which I had incarnated, was a mission to mankind; and this must explain why, <em>pari
    passu</em> with my personal</p>
    <p>{529}</p>
    <p>progress, I walked continually in the way of the world. My spiritual life itself was
    now therefore definitely duplex, and this fact must be kept in mind if my subsequent
    actions are to be properly understood.</p>
    <p>Arriving in England on the second of June, I was stunned by the news of my bereavement.
    I made a point of detaching my mind. In the train from Liverpool to London I continued to
    chat with my companions on the boat as if nothing had happened. Having got to bed I
    released the prisoner. There was only one thing to be done: &quot;I solemnly reaffirmed
    the oath of my obligation to perform the Operation, offering under these terrible
    circumstances all that yet remained.&quot;</p>
    <p>I am convinced, by the way, that the unremitting blows of misfortune, of which this
    bereavement was the first, were caused by the malice of the Abra-Melin demons, but that
    none of them would have reached me if I had understood and obeyed the Secret Chiefs and
    the forces behind them in the Shanghai working.</p>
    <p>It was really curious the way one form of slight illness after another attacked me. My
    wife happened to make some remark to this effect to the housekeeper, a real old Sussex
    product. She nodded her head wisely. &quot;He'll never be better,&quot; she said in an
    oracular tone, &quot;until that baby is born.&quot; I found on inquiry that it is a
    widespread superstition in Sussex that sometimes especially when the husband is unusually
    devoted to his wife, she escapes the usual inconvenience of pregnancy, while he is
    constantly ill. The idea is of sympathetic transference.</p>
    <p>I became seriously ill. Through everything, surgery and all, I continued the daily
    work. On July 26th I went to stay with Cecil Jones, who was now an Exempt Adept. (The
    initials of his motto are D.D.S.) I conferred with him about my operation. The main points
    are as follows: (I quote Captain J.F.C.Fuller's account.)</p>

    <p>I intended to use this Invocation in practice. The amethyst was to be, so to speak, the
    lens through which the Holy Guardian Angel should manifest. On September 17th I went to
    Ashdown Park Hotel, Coulsdon, Surrey and recovered my health suddenly and completely. On
    the twenty-first I had completed thirty-two weeks of the Operation and thirty-one weeks of
    actual daily invocation. The next day D.D.S. came to see me: we celebrated the Autumnal
    Equinox and reconstructed the old Neophyte Ritual of the G.'. D.'., eliminating all
    unnecessary features and quintessentializing the magical formulae.</p>
    <p>On the ninth, having prepared a full invocation and ritual, I performed it. I had no
    expectation, I think, of attaining any special success; but it came. I had performed the
    Operation of the Sacred Magick of Abra-Melin the Mage.</p>
    <p>It is unlawful to speak of the supreme sacrament. It was such, as the following entry
    shows, that I found it hard to believe that I had been permitted to partake of it. I will
    confine myself to the description of some of the ancillary phenomena.</p>

    greatest event of Fra. P.'s career. Yet this is an account of the highest trances --- of
    Shivadarshana itself, as we know from other sources. The &quot;vision&quot; (to use still
    the name become totally inadequate) appears to have had three main points in its
    Atmadarshana stage ---</p>
    <p>1. The Universal Peacock.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>2. The Universe as Ego. &quot;I who am all and made it all, abide its separate
    lord,&quot; i.e. the universe becomes a single and simple being, without quantity, quality
    or conditions. In this the &quot;I&quot; is immanent, yet the &quot;I&quot; made it, and
    the &quot;I&quot; is entirely apart from it. (This is the Christian doctrine of the
    Trinity, or something very like it.)</p>
    <p>3. This Trinity is transcended by an impersonal Unity. This is then annihilated by the
    Opening of the Eye of Shiva. It is absolutely futile to discuss this; it has been tried
    and failed again and again. Even those with experience of the earlier part of the
    &quot;vision&quot; in its fullness must find it totally impossible to imagine anything so
    subversive of the whole base, not only of the ego, but of the absolute behind the ego.</p>
    <p>The very next day the enemy struck home below the belt, as described in the previous
    chapter. The blow could not shake my soul. For over three weeks I bore the stigmata of my
    Operation physically. I visibly radiated light. People used to turn in the street to look
    at me; they did not know what it was, but the impression must have been irresistible.</p>
    <p>No sooner had this worn off than the enemy struck again at my health. I was obliged to
    put myself once more in the doctor's hands and go to Bournemouth. I was now thoroughly
    prepared to take up my Work of initiating mankind, but I was still determined to do it on
    the old lines.</p>
    <p>I had no books of reference at Bournemouth, and it struck me that it would be very
    convenient if I possessed a volume giving all the correspondences of the Cabbala in a
    compact form. I spent a week in writing this down from memory and the result is <em>Liber
    777</em>. (It is to be noticed that there is no reference to the Cairo working anywhere in
    this book.)</p>
    <p>In the month of December the Secret Chiefs formally invited me, thorough G.R. Frater
    D.D.S., to take my place officially in the Third Order. I still felt that I was not
    worthy. Not till three years later did I accept the grade, and then only after having
    passed ceremonially through the Abyss in the fullest possible measure.</p>
