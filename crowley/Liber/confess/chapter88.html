    <p>The last lap! I sweep into the straight. The last jump has been cleared. Nothing now
    between me and the winning post.</p>
    <p>I made a rapid summary of my situation. The bronchitis and asthma, which were the
    symptoms of the emphyzema exacted by the God of the Mountains as the sacrifice due from
    whoever would approach his altars, had become a regular feature of winter. My obvious
    course was to dodge it by migrating to North Africa. There was no opposing argument.
    England was still upside down. I perceived the futility of any campaign to establish the
    Law there at present.</p>
    <p>My original plan had been to join the Ape of Thoth in Switzerland where she was staying
    with her sister pending my arrival. But I found myself disinclined for some obscure reason
    to go there. I wanted to be within easy reach of London for the time being, and
    accordingly wired her to join me in Paris, which she did on January 11th, the first
    anniversary of our liaison. With her was her two-year-old son who appears in <em>The Diary
    of a Drug Fiend</em> as Dionysus. We were hoping to &quot;put his nose out of joint&quot;
    in February or March.</p>
    <p>My object in staying near London was as follows.</p>
    <p>When I left for New York, I had confided the administration of the O.T.O. to the Grand
    Treasurer, George Macnie Cowie, VIII°, Frater Fiat Pax, a Neophyte of A.'. A.'.. He was a
    man of over fifty years, the art editor of Nelson's, the publishers of Edinburgh. He was
    deaf and dumb. His character was unselfish and noble, his aspiration intense and sincere.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>He was a gentleman on whom I built<br>
          <font color="#C0C0C0">............</font>An absolute trust.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>During the war, he wrote voluminously to keep me informed of the affairs of the Order.
    I had but one complaint to make of his conduct. I asked repeatedly for his accounts as
    treasurer and he would not send them. As time passed his letters became increasingly rabid
    against Germany. Deprived of adequate verbal communication with others, he trusted the
    newspapers and took their frenzy for fact. I was alarmed at his attitude and referred him
    to <em>The Book of the Law</em>.</p>
    <p>Cap. II,v. 60: Therefore strike hard &amp; low, and to hell with them, master!</p>
    <p>Cap. III,v. 59: As brothers fight ye!</p>
    <p>{856}</p>
    <p>&quot;Don't hate the Germans,&quot; I urged. &quot;Love them. Keep cool in order to
    help them in the only way possible; by smashing them up to teach them how to behave.&quot;
    He only grew worse. I warned him at last that such virulent hatred would end in this going
    mad. And my words came true. His character changed completely; he began to intrigue
    against me secretly and even to rob me, or rather the Order, outright. I cannot say how
    far he was abetted by the solicitors of the Order but they, no less than he, evaded
    rendering any account of the property of the Order. I was ultimately compelled to appeal
    to the police. Under this pressure he sent a balance sheet. The cat was out of the bag.
    The Order had been systematically defrauded. Let me instance only one item. A sum of five
    hundred pounds was entered twice. It was the most barefaced outrage in experience. The
    Grand Secretary General had had the same idea. A sum of one thousand pounds had been
    entrusted to her. She realized the securities and disappeared into the unknown. As to the
    furniture and other assets, practically all the more valuable items had been taken out of
    the warehouse by Cowie and were not to be found. Cowie's insanity was made the excuse for
    endless delays in settling the various matters. I found myself almost penniless. My
    available funds scarcely sufficed to postpone starvation for more than a few weeks. It was
    quite impossible to seek legal redress against the thieves. I was also foolish enough to
    hope that Cowie might explain his actions and restore the property. (I have not yet
    succeeded in extracting the account from the lawyers.)</p>
    <p>I bethought myself of Fontainebleau and took the Ape to Moret. We encamped at a
    charming inn, the Hotel de Bourgoyne, while looking around for a house where the ape could
    receive proper care when her crisis arrived.</p>
    <p>During the Atlantic crossing she had made friends with a proven&#135;al girl, born in
    Paris, who had spent some years in America as nursery governess to some first-class
    people; in particular a well-known ambassador. She had married and given birth to a son.
    Her husband being killed in an accident, she had gone back to her old work, but sickened
    and wearied. So she had made up her mind to return to Europe.</p>
    <p>It struck me that the Ape ought to have a woman to look after her and I suggested her
    writing to this girl to join us. She brought her boy down from Paris. They gave me the
    shock of my life. The girl was bloodless, drooping like a thirsty flower, and she dragged
    her brat along listlessly, he as lifeless as she. His face was ghastly white and his limbs
    as a damp rag. I thrilled to the marrow with pity and made up my mind then and there to
    begin my work of saving mankind by bringing these two back to life.</p>
    <p>The new current of courage and confidence was irresistible. I found a charming house at
    11 bis rue de Neuville, Fontainebleau. We took it from February on. My new patients, who
    appear in <em>The Diary of A Drug Fiend</em> as Sister Cypris and Hermes, had joined us
    without any definite agreement as to</p>
    <p>{857}</p>
    <p>the future. Hermes was in shocking shape. He whined and wailed unceasingly like a puppy
    in pain. He clung to his mother with pitiful helplessness and she had no idea beyond
    spoiling him in every way. My personality and moral fortitude soon took effect on Cypris.
    I made her take long walks through the forest with me, the Ape being of course unable to
    exert herself beyond mild exercise. Cypris regained physical health and strength rapidly
    with the natural result that her spirits recovered their tone. She saw me as her saviour
    no less than Jairus's daughter must have seen Jesus and her gratitude soon turned to an
    ecstasy of romantic love. It carried her beyond herself. She was almost ready to kill
    herself in despair at the thought of my attachment to the Ape.</p>
    <p>One superb afternoon, sunny and spring-like --- it might have been May --- we had
    lunched at the Barbison, the wine went to our heads. After our first burst of speed, we
    sat down in a glade upon a bank of soft green moss and, without a preface of words, fell
    into each other's arms. We walked home on air and the next few days passed like a pageant
    of purple pleasure and passion.</p>
    <p>And then she struck a snag. She had taken it for granted that my love for her would
    make me forget my friendship, cancel my obligations and abrogate my affection. She was
    amazed and angry to find that my attitude to the Ape had not been altered in any way
    whatever by my liaison with her. She supposed the conventional stupidities, cruelties and
    crimes were laws of nature; not understanding the Law of Thelema and hankering after
    exclusive possession, she fell into a frenzy of mistrust and jealousy. It made things
    worse that I smilingly accepted her tantrums exactly as an alienist with the outbursts of
    a maniac. I refused to quarrel; my kindness, tenderness, affection and nonchalance were
    inexpugnable. She went from bad to worse during the following months, but I maintained
    firm correctness and at last she gave up trying to drag me down to her ignoble ideal. In
    the depths of her despair there grew a glimmer. She began to understand that love was not
    necessarily accompanied by meanness, falsehood, callousness and selfishness. Beholding
    beauty afar off, she staggered stumblingly up the ragged rocks towards the light, and in
    the end cast off the chains of selfish lust and became a free and happy woman, as she is
    today.</p>
    <p>&quot;He must teach; but he may make severe the ordeals.&quot; In her case, she had to
    suffer indescribably anguish to attain salvation, because her ignorance and animal
    appetite had usurped the throne of her soul and reigned so long unchallenged. Yet even of
    this came a marvel.</p>
    <p>Her command of English was imperfect; her spelling and grammar very defective. She had
    read little and that little worthless. Nor had she any ambition to learn to write. I had,
    of course, insisted on her recording her experiences in a Magical Diary, and what was my
    amazement, on reading the first section, to find it an unsurpassed masterpiece! This
    ignorant untrained</p>
    <p>{858}</p>
    <p>nursemaid had analysed herself so deeply and accurately, had dramatized her tragedy so
    powerfully, and had expressed her experiences in intense and emphatic language, eked out
    by metaphors derived from direct observation, that this record is more pitilessly truthful
    than Marie Bashkirtseff at her best; the stark savagery, the naked cruelty of her
    passions, is no less fierce than anything in <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. She had plumbed
    the bottmless pit of damnation and ravaged the heights of heaven with rage and rapture.</p>
    <p>Some passages in this marvellous manuscript contain expressions which propriety
    declares unsuited for publication. She had no skill in polite euphemisms and, of course,
    no idea that her work would ever be read, save by me. In fact, she tried to destroy it on
    my asking to see it and I only secured it after physical struggle. We must, I fear, bow in
    the temple of Rimmon to the extent of editing such passages, which I hate to do; their
    brutal obscenity is an essential element in her character. Should a tiger describe his
    sensations while eating a man, we should lose by amending his account so as to make it as
    elegant as that of a city banquet. I will either publish it in a country with common sense
    or edit it in such a way that the intelligent reader, by the use of a little imagination,
    will be able to reconstruct the text.</p>
    <p>(How ridiculous and disgusting this mealy-mouthed morality is! We print Mark Twain's
    schoolboy smut about Sir Walter Raleigh at the court of Queen Elizabeth --- it circulates
    under the rose among the most prominent people in society. Why balk at a masterpiece,
    sublime by virtue of its naked truth, and its spiritual intensity and exaltation, in every
    way the greatest work ever yet achieved by a woman? I say, emphatically, on my honour that
    I know of nothing in the whole range of literature which compares with it for all those
    qualities which are the root of beauty and power, and so saying, I am mindful of my
    exaggerated enthusiasm about my own achievements in precisely these directions.)</p>
