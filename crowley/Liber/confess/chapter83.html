    <p>It is a remarkable fact that physical phenomena of an appropriate character frequently
    accompany a spiritual event. I fail to see any special significance, from a magical point
    of view, in the experience now to be related; but it is highly interesting in itself, and
    there is unquestionably a striking correlation between it and the vision just described.</p>
    <p>One morning I had started before dawn for the upper reaches of the lake. The day was
    breathlessly intense, the calm was somehow positive rather than negative, and seemed to
    conceal some huge menace. It was as if the heart of the world had stopped. I felt an
    indescribable awe, overwhelming in its solemnity. The act of paddling seemed almost a
    blasphemy. However, I made a fire on a rocky islet and cooked and ate my lunch, returning
    to the cottage in a curiously exhausted state. It was one of those days when the
    electrical conditions seem to abstract every particle of energy from one's nerves. The
    condition is familiar enough to me, and I understood that it foretold an approaching
    thunderstorm; in fact, an hour later, as I sprawled lazily on the verandah, I saw the
    imminence of the tempest. I realized that, wharf or no wharf, my canoe could not possibly
    live through what was coming. I dashed down to the water's edge at the exact moment when
    the first drop of rain fell, and although the distance was barely a hundred and fifty
    yards in all, and I picked up the canoe and tucked it under my arm like an umbrella, I was
    soaked and dripping before I got back to shelter. At this moment, a dog-cart, occupied by
    a man, a woman and a child, was hastily backed up away from the road, and they asked leave
    to take refuge till the rain stopped. I showed them into the main room, staying outside
    myself to watch the wonder of the storm. Daylight had disappeared with the utmost
    suddenness. A pall of purple black drove down the valley at a height of scarce a hundred
    feet above the water, and this pall was veined with a network of incessant lightning.
    Beneath it the air seemed praeternaturally clear. It was the most spectacular performance
    I had ever seen. Ahead of the storm, the vast blue sky stood speckless above the unrippled
    sheen of the lake. Then the advance guard of the tempest, the hail and the rain splashed
    down in giant drops like bullets. Then came the berry purple of the cloud, and under it
    the wind lashed the lake into tempestuous froth so fiercely that no water remained
    visible.</p>
    <p>The storm struck deadly chill: and, having been reminded recently of the lurking
    malaria in my blood, I decided to put on dry clothes.</p>
    <p>{812}</p>
    <p>I must give a brief description of the construction of the cottage. It was of wood,
    built round a chimney stack and fireplace of brick. The main room faced the lake; and on
    the other side of the stack were a bedroom which I did not use and the kitchen. The main
    room, where I slept, being occupied by my guests, I had to take my dry clothes into the
    bedroom. This room had two small windows. I forget whether they were both closed; but if
    open, the slit was not more than two or three inches wide. There was a door, also closed,
    leading into the kitchen. The other door which led to the main room may possibly have been
    a little ajar. To put on my stockings, I sat down on a chair close to the brickwork of the
    chimney stack. As I bent down, I noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement,
    that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches in
    diameter, was stationary about six inches below and to the right of my right knee. As I
    looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the
    continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and
    smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight
    shock in the middle of my right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of
    my body. I must emphasize that I was not in the slightest degree alarmed or otherwise
    mentally disturbed. It will be remembered that I had been struck by lightning on the
    Pillar Mountain many years earlier. I have always felt extreme oppression while an
    electrical storm is gathering and a corresponding exhilaration the moment it breaks. I
    have a powerful instinctive feeling that I am myself an wholly electrical phenomenon, and
    the wilder the storm, the more completely do I feel myself in my element. I am impelled to
    physical enthusiasm expressed in delightedly triumphant magical gestures and outbursts of
    ecstatically religious incantations. I am thrilled to the marrow by the mere full title of
    the Tarot Card called the Knight of Wands, &quot;The Lord of the Flame and the Lightning,
    the King of the Spirits of Fire!&quot; I want to shout aloud the superb Enochian
    invocation of that force. Something of that exaltation may be divined from the rhythm and
    swing of the lyric into which I have introduced this title:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>By the Brood of the Bysses of Brightening, whose<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>God was my sire;<br>
        By the Lord of the Flame and the Lightning, the King<br>
        <font color="#C0C0C0">....</font>of the Spirits of Fire ...</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This spiritually sublime intensity does not in any way interfere with my intellectual
    activity. On the contrary, I become more alert than in almost any other conditions. It is
    as if the illumination of the flash interpenetrated my spirit, as if my mental faculties
    entered into enjoyment of their ideal nourishment and simulation thereby.</p>
    <p>{813}</p>
    <p>I was consequently in the best possible condition to observe. My perfectly impersonal
    interest, and of course my scientific training, stood me in excellent stead. My time sense
    was markedly altered, much as I have described in the account of the attack on me in
    Calcutta. I was thus able to observe the events of what was probably not more than five
    seconds as if it had been as many minutes.</p>
    <p>I thought the phenomenon of sufficient interest to record; and wrote a brief
    description to the <em>New York Times</em>. The result was surprising. I found myself
    inundated with letters of inquiry from so many electrical students that I had at last to
    have an account multigraphed to send out.</p>
    <p>I had supposed that globular electricity was a well-known and undoubted, if rare,
    phenomenon, and was amazed to learn that until then it had never been seen by any reliable
    and competent observer. I had quite an elaborate correspondence with with Professor Elihu
    Thompson, one of the greatest living authorities on electricity, about it. It appeared
    that previous accounts were the statements of common sailors. They left considerable room
    for doubting the existence of globular electricity at all. This doubt was strengthened by
    the extreme difficulty of framing any satisfactory hypothesis to explain the occurrence.
    My observation turned out, therefore, to be (in its way) a matter of primary importance. I
    ventured to suggest an explanation of my own; but Professor Thompson felt that, while it
    covered the facts of the case and even those of previous observations, it involved a
    conception of electricity which was not easy to reconcile with the implications of certain
    other phenomena.</p>
    <p>In the course of our correspondence, Professor Thompson communicated several extremely
    subtle and stimulating ideas as to the nature of matter, electricity and indeed of nature
    in general. They perhaps helped me to envisage consciously, for the first time, a strictly
    formal identification of the results of rational intellection with those of immediate
    intuition. I had felt, not without severe qualms, that the data of Neschamah might be in
    irreconcilable antagonism with those of Ruach. I was not in any way shaken in my opinion
    that the crown of Ruach (Daäth, Knowledge) had no true place on the Tree of Life, that it
    was essentially illusory and self-contradictory. It had been my constant preoccupation to
    find a means of expression for the truth of spiritual illumination in terms of rational
    comprehension, and moreover to justify the former without denying the validity of the
    later. Professor Thompson's remarks filled me with hope. It must be remembered that at the
    period when I studied science most exclusively, the reaction against mysticism was in full
    swing. The persecution of Darwin was like an unhealed scar; its contemplation bred
    resentment against the very root of any religious interpretation of the universe. I had
    been forced into the awkward position of having to be ready to go to the stake with
    Maudsley,</p>
    <p>{814}</p>
    <p>Ray Lankester and Haeckel, as against superstitious religion, and yet to attack their
    conclusions with the utmost vehemence in the interests of the impregnable spiritual
    position which I had built on the rock of my own actual experience. At last it had become
    conceivable that this antinomy might be overcome, and that in the best way, in the way
    indicated by the symbolism of the Cabbalah itself; that is to say, the eyes of science
    were opening gradually to the perception that the results of observation and experiment
    demanded an interpretation as repugnant to common sense (as understood by the man in the
    street and the Rationalist Press Association) as the utmost conceptions of Pythagoras,
    Paracelsus and that Great Order itself of which I was an initiate. My subsequent
    researches have been almost exclusively determined by considerations of this kind. While I
    have done my utmost to advance directly towards truth by the regular traditional magical
    and mystical methods which <em>The Book of the Law</em> had perfected, I have constantly
    sought <em>pari passu</em> to correlate my results with those of modern intellectual
    progress; indeed, to demonstrate that the deepest thinkers are unwittingly approaching the
    apprehension of initiated ideas, and are in fact, despite themselves, being compelled to
    extend their definition of the Ruach to include conceptions proper to Neschamah, that they
    are, in other words, becoming initiates in our sense of the word without suspecting that
    they are committing high treason against the majesty of materialism.</p>
    <p>The remaining Chokmah days of the initiation proper seemed to be devoted principally to
    showing the candidate the material on which he is to work. I hope it will not sound too
    strange if I say that up to this time of my life I had been to a certain extent living in
    a fool's paradise. In one way or another, either by actual shelter, by the protection of
    social and financial resources, by my own poetic rose-coloured spectacles, or by the
    singularly happy choice that I had made of the people among whom I dwell, I had not seen
    in all its naked nastiness the world of mankind. I had seen a good deal of cruelty,
    stupidity and callousness; I realized how ignoble were the lives of the average man and
    woman, but there had been practically always a reasonable amount of compensation. It is
    necessary to live in the United States and know the people well to get a really clear view
    of hell with the lid off. I had already been some time in the country, but the truth about
    New York had been camouflaged. I, being who I was, had come into contact with the very
    cream of the city, and on my travels about the Union, I had seen little more than the
    superficial life of the people as it appears to the wanderer whose tent is a pullman car,
    a swagger hotel, or the abode of some friend who by that very fact is not truly
    representative of his community. I was soon to be brought into intimate relations with a
    society so primitive that it had no means of knowing who I was or recognizing the</p>
    <p>{815}</p>
    <p>class I represented; to experience what the French rather neatly call
    le-struggle-for-lifeisme; and that with the absolute moral certainty of being completely
    beaten from the very nature of things. In a country where the most week and ignorant, the
    least intelligent and resourceful, find it easy enough on the whole to earn a fairly
    decent living, and where the slightest capacity of almost any sort makes it a safe bet
    that ten years will put its possessor in Easy Street, I was to find myself a candidate for
    complete destitution. For many months I was, for the first time in my life, constantly
    preoccupied with the problem of keeping myself alive, and did so only by the operations of
    periodical windfalls. Again and again my coracle sank under me and each time those
    responsible for the conduct of my initiation handed out something to go on with from some
    totally unexpected source, in order to keep me on that psychological razor-edge whence one
    can always see the abyss as one can no longer do when one is in it. In this way, I saw all
    classes and all races, but no longer from the privileged standpoint, with the result that
    I was able to understand thoroughly what they were like to themselves and to each other.
    The horror and loathsomeness of those conditions left a permanent mark upon my character.
    It went far to destroy my capacity for lyrical expression, or perhaps rather to make
    impossible the point of view necessary to that kind of creative impulse. Love itself was
    to appear in a totally new form. I had never before understood its roots in the moral
    weakness and physical incompetence of our breed of monkeys. I had been familiar enough
    with its romantic and spiritual implication, with the social and economic complications
    which degrade its ideal, and even with the brutalities and blasphemies which lust and
    greed impose upon it. I had never understood it as the expression of the bitter need of
    desperation which is after all its true nature so far as all but a very few individuals <em>rari
    nantes in gurgito vasto</em> are concerned.</p>
    <p>It would be impossible for me even to attempt the merest outline of the abomination of
    desolation upon which the Chiefs forced me to gaze during these long dreary dreadful days.
    It was not that I saw only the vilest and basest elements in society; on the contrary, I
    was deeply impressed by the essential virtue which forms part of every human being, and
    the poison upon the barb of my experience was the fact that ignorance, unskilfulness,
    moral weakness and the like made the helplessness and hopelessness of virtue utterly
    complete. Everywhere I saw unspeakably loathsome and inhuman vices triumphing with scarce
    a show of resistance; commerce in its uncleanliest forms had harnessed morality, religion
    and even science to its Jaganath car. Every decent instinct, whether of the individual or
    of the community, was the prey of this ghoul. In another chapter I shall give instances of
    the kind of thing which was not wholly dominant but practically universal. I have said
    enough to convey a general idea of the nature of the ordeal through</p>
    <p>{816}</p>
    <p>which I was passed at this period. I need only record a few of the actual magical
    results.</p>
    <p>The misery which I underwent at this time had done much to cloud my memory. I do not
    clearly remember, for example, my reasons for going to New Orleans almost immediately
    after returning from Lake Pasquaney. It was my last glimpse of beauty for a long while.
    The old French-Spanish quarter of the city is the only decent inhabited district that I
    discovered in America. From the architecture to the manners of the people, their clothes,
    their customs and their cookery, all was delightful. It was like being back in Europe
    again with the added charm of a certain wildness and romance; it was a civilization <em>sui
    generis</em>, with its own peculiar adornment in the way of history. It enabled me to
    realize the spirit of the Middle Ages as even the most remote and time-honoured towns of
    Europe rarely do. I took a room conveniently close to the Old Absinthe House, where one
    could get real absinthe prepared in fountains whose marble was worn by ninety years'
    continual dripping. The result was that I was seized by another of my spasms of literary
    creation, and this time, the definite sexual stimulus which I had imagined as partly
    responsible for such attacks was, if not absent, at least related to an atmosphere rather
    than to an individual.</p>
    <p>It lasted, if I remember rightly, some seventeen days. I completely lost track of the
    properties of times and place. I walked over to the Absinthe House in my shirt sleeves on
    one occasion without being in the slightest degree aware of the fact. My best work was an
    essay &quot;The Green
    Goddess</a>&quot;, descriptive of the Old Absinthe House itself in particular, and the
    atmosphere of the quarter in general. It may be regarded as the only rival to &quot;The
    Heart of Holy Russia&quot; for literary excellence and psychological insight. I wrote also
    <em>The Scrutinies of Simon Iff</em>, a series of six more or less detective stories; two
    or three less important essays; some short stories, of which I may mention &quot;Every
    Precaution&quot; for its local colour; and all but the last two or three chapters of my
    first serious attempt at a long novel, <em>The Net</em>. I also began from the very depths
    of my spiritual misery a very strange book of an entirely new kind; so much so that I
    describe it as &quot;A Novelissim&quot;.<strong>1</strong> Its title is <em>Not the Life
    and Adventure of Sir Roger Bloxam</em>. It remains unfinished to this day; in fact it is
    hardly theoretically possible to finish it, strictly speaking. I have indeed serious
    qualms as to whether I have not overstepped the limits of truth in saying that I began it.
    To be safe, I should be content to say I wrote a good deal of it.</p>
    <p>The lyrical faculty remained almost entirely dormant, no doubt owing to the fact that
    in a quarter where almost every woman attracted me intensely, I was quite unable to fix my
    affection on a single specimen. Perhaps also it was inhibited by the iron which was
    entering my soul inch by inch and being twisted in my heart by the pitiless love of the
    Secret Chiefs of the Order.</p>
    <p>{817}<ol>
      <li><font size="2">WEH note: Actually, it's a shaggy dog story.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p>It was this, without doubt, which threw a monkey-wrench into my creative machinery and
    its destructive energy may be measured by the frightful circumstance which must next be
    recorded.</p>
    <p>The city of New Orleans is divided into two main sections by a broad thoroughfare. On
    one side is the Spanish quarter, on the outskirts of which was a large and picturesque red
    light section; one of the most interesting places of its kind that I have ever seen. In
    fact, if we except Cairo, it would have been hard to beat. Across the main street was the
    modern commercial Americanized section where hardly a brick but screamed an obscene
    blasphemy against everything that might delight a poet, arouse enthusiasm in a lover, or
    abstain from revolting the instincts of a gentleman. Before I had been long in the city,
    it had become obvious that this cancer was eating away the breast of the beautiful city,
    and the conviction was stamped into my soul by a very definite hoof-mark of the mule
    morality.</p>
    <p>A millionaire with a very large interest in the racecourse at Havana bethought him that
    it would be good business to do away with the competition of New Orleans in that form of
    sport. He therefore proceeded to organize what is called a &quot;clean-up&quot; of the
    city. He bribed prominent pulpits to awake the consciences of sincere puritans, squared
    the politicians and the newspapers, brought blackmail to bear on any honest people that
    seemed likely to stand in his way, and in every other respect fulfilled the conditions
    requisite for plundering the city and persecuting the poor, in the name of righteousness
    according to the most approved methods. His most spectacular success was to shut up the
    red light district, so far as the poorest classes were concerned. The effect of these
    proceedings was brought home to me by an incident which, happening in the United States,
    appeared to me vastly comic. I had been to the library in Lee Circle to get a book and
    descending the steps was accosted by a woman with a request for charity. I recognized her
    as one of the denizens of the wooden shanties of the red light district. My sympathy was
    aroused by the shameful cruelty to which she had been subjected by the hypocritical and
    dishonest manoeuvres of the millionaire and his myrmidons. Her case was peculiarly
    pathetic as she was suffering from an active and contagious form of disease. The most
    elementary common sense and decency would have come to her rescue long before, in the
    interest of her clients, no less than her own. I asked her what she was going to do now
    that her office had been closed. To my surprise, she was perfectly cheerful. The relief
    which she sought was only temporary, for she had got a good position as a nursemaid in a
    family of three young children for the following week!</p>
    <p>Such was one of the innumerable similar symptoms of the foul disease which is ravaging
    the United States, and has already destroyed almost every vestige of the political,
    religious and individual liberty which was the very essence of the original American idea.
    My spirit sank under the contemplation</p>
    <p>{818}</p>
    <p>of the irremediable calamity which threatens to engulf the whole of humanity since it
    is now an accepted principle of business to endeavour to make tyranny international, to
    suppress all customs of historical interest, and indeed everything which lends variety or
    distraction to human society in the interest of making a market for standardized products.
    The moral excuse for these activities is miserably thin, for the element which it is most
    important to suppress is originality as such, even when the question concerns the very
    idea of craftsmanship in itself. The idea at the back of puritanism is the reduction of
    the mass of humanity to a degree of slavery which has never previously been so much as
    contemplated by the most malignant tyrants in history; for it aims at completing the
    helplessness of the workman by minimizing his capacity. He must no more be permitted to
    exercise the creative craftsmanship involved in making a pair of boots; he must be
    rendered unable to do more than repeat mechanically, year in, year out, one meaningless
    item in the manufacture, so that when the pinch comes it shall be impossible for anyone to
    have boots at all except through the complex industrial conspiracy of the trusts. This
    idea, consciously or subconsciously, lies underneath all attempts to extend
    &quot;civilization&quot;. The progress of this pestilence is only too visible all over the
    world. Standardized hotels and standardized merchandise have invaded the remotest
    districts, and these would be economically impossible unless supported by the forcible
    suppression of local competition. When, therefore, we find the newspapers indignant at
    Mohammedan morality, we may suspect the real trouble is that American hatters see no hope
    of disposing of their surplus stock, as long as the wicked Oriental sticks to his turban
    or tarbush. The exquisite, dignified and comfortable clothes of remote people, from Sicily
    to Japan, must give way to the vile shoddy products of foreign factories, and the motive
    is supplied by a worldwide campaign on behalf of social snobbery. The people are persuaded
    that they ought to try to look like a sporting duke or a bank president. Such plans
    obviously depend on the destruction of everything that makes for originality,
    self-respect, the love of beauty or the reverence for history.</p>
    <p>It took me a long while before I could formulate consciously this idea, so protean are
    its disguises and so subtly sinister its stratagems. But I have always possessed the
    instinct, I have always reacted automatically against this principle whenever I found it.
    It should be obvious that &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; cuts diametrically athwart this
    modern civilization to destroy the distinctions which constitute the sole hope of humanity
    to make real progress by the selection and variation which are the means of evolution. It
    may be said that my own work is in the nature of missionary enterprise; and that this is,
    in fact, the very thing to which I object, since its idea is to persuade people to abandon
    their established beliefs and customs. This criticism is invalid. I do, as a matter of
    fact, object to missionary enterprise as such, whether it take the</p>
    <p>{819}</p>
    <p>form of imposing the cult of Osiris on the worshippers of Adonis, of persuading the
    Chinese to eat with knives and forks, or of making Eastern women obscenely ridiculous by
    changing their superb and suitable robes for frocks which pretend to have been made in
    Paris. But my message differs fundamentally from all previously promulgated precisely at
    this point. My predecessors have invariably said, &quot;My belief is right and yours is
    wrong; my customs are worthy, yours are ignoble; my dress is decent, yours is not; think
    as I think, talk as I talk, do as I do, or you will be wretched, poor, sick, disgraced and
    damned; besides which, I shall cut your head off, burn you alive, starve you, imprison
    you, ostracize you and otherwise make you sorry you did not agree to be a good boy.&quot;
    The essence of every missionary message has been to assimilate the taught to the teacher;
    and it has always been accompanied by bribes and threats. My message is exactly opposed to
    any of this. I say to each man and woman, &quot;You are unique and sovereign, the centre
    of an universe. However right I may be in thinking as I do, you may be equally right in
    thinking otherwise. You can only accomplish your object in life by complete disregard of
    the opinions of other people. You must not even take the outward signs of success as
    indications that the course of action which has produced them would serve your turn. For
    one thing, my coronet might not suit your complexion but give you a headache; for another,
    the measures which I took to obtain that coronet might not succeed in your case.&quot;</p>
    <p>My mission is, in short, to bring everyone to the realization and enjoyment of his own
    kingship, and my apparent interference with him amounts to no more than advice to him not
    to suffer interference. It may appear from this as if I were opposed to joint action
    directed to the attainment of a common purpose. But, of course, this is not the case. The
    advantages, not merely of cooperation but of disciplined union are the same as they were
    with previous theories of life. Yet there is a certain practical difference which, by the
    way, is curiously illustrated by the parallel of military discipline. In primitive
    warfare, the nexus between comrades is practically limited to an agreement to forget their
    individual quarrels in face of the common enemy. The training of a soldier thus amounted
    to encouraging his personal prowess. It was gradually seen that some sort of plan for
    combined action made for victory, so that one leader or chieftain should be detailed to
    carry out a definite duty. It soon became clear that isolated action was dangerous to the
    whole army; and the consequent tendency was developed to the point at which the Prussian
    drill sergeant was invaluable. The aim was to reduce the soldier to a brainless bulk of
    brawn, to be manipulated as mechanically as a chessman, exercising his inherent energies
    without the slightest wish or power to think or act for himself. (This stage corresponds
    to that which we are rapidly approaching in industry.) Now at least we have reached a
    further stage. The complexity of a battle and its mere extent in space have made it
    impossible for</p>
    <p>{820}</p>
    <p>a single man to handle his troops as was done by Marlborough and Napoleon, and
    therefore it has become once more necessary for the subordinate officer, and even, to some
    extent, the private soldier to understand his responsibility, to exercise initiative
    within limits, and also to train himself to be able to carry out a variety of operations
    demanding very varied knowledge and skill, instead of, as before, being confined to a
    highly specialized task demanding blind obedience and the suppression of all intelligence.
    The Charge of the Light Brigade has in fact become impossible. We are moving intelligently
    enough back in the direction of Sir Launcelot and Crillon. The necessities of warfare are
    the more truly instructive in that the military type of mind is so contemptible. The
    commander-in chief is always hopelessly incompetent either to conceive or to perceive
    correctly the very elements of his business. The progress of military science is imposed
    upon stupidly by the facts; and it affords us, therefore, the best possible illustration
    of the blind workings of evolution. That is why industry, whose chiefs are just one degree
