    <p>&quot;The best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley.&quot; Even so cunning a
    combination of rat and ape as my Uncle Tom made occasional mistakes, and one of these was
    very fortunate for me. He engaged a tutor names Archibald Douglas, an Oxford man who had
    purged that offence by having travelled for the Bible Society across Persia. If my uncle
    had ever heard of George Borrow, he might have saved himself much trouble; and I might
    have been driven insane. It was in the spring of '91. I had recovered from a bad attack of
    whooping-cough. The idea was that we should bicycle down to Torquay, but on reaching
    Gildford I was too ill to ride further and we went down by train. Though Douglas called
    himself a Christian, he proved to be both a man and a gentleman. I presume that poverty
    had compelled the camouflage. From the moment that we were alone together he produced a
    complete revolution in my outlook upon life, by showing me for the first time a sane,
    clean jolly world worth living in. Smoking and drinking were natural. He warned me of the
    dangers of excess from the athletic standpoint. He introduced me to racing, billiards,
    betting, cards and women. He told me how these things might be enjoyed without damaging
    oneself or wronging others. He put me up to all the tricks. He showed me the meaning of
    honour. I immediately accepted his standpoint and began to behave like a normal, healthy
    human being. The nightmare world of Christianity vanished at the dawn. I fell in with a
    girl of the theatre in the first ten days at Torquay, and at that touch of human love the
    detestable mysteries of sex were transformed into joy and beauty. The obsession of sin
    fell from my shoulders into the sea of oblivion. I had been almost overwhelmed by the
    appalling responsibility of ensuring my own damnation and helping others to escape from
    Jesus. I found that the world was, after all, full of delightful damned souls; of people
    who accepted nature as she is, accepted their own place in nature and enjoyed it, fought
    mean and despicable things fairly and firmly whenever they met them. It was a period of
    boundless happiness for me. I had always yearned for the beauty of nature; my only
    friends, except animals and occasional strangers, from whom I was carefully protected, had
    been the skies, the streams, the mountains and the seas. For the first time in my life I
    was brought into contact with my fellow men and women. For the first time honest
    friendship, wholesome love, frank, gay and courageous, became possible and actual. I had
    loved nature as a refuge from mankind. I now perceived the beauty of the world in
    conjunction with the beauty of my species. For the first time</p>
    <p>{75}</p>
    <p>the sea sparkled, the breezes whispered other songs than those in praise of solitude,
    the flowers lent their fragrance and their folly to light, laughing girlhood; the moon,
    instead of Artemis, was Aphrodite.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I said, &quot;she is warmer than Dian . . .<br>
          Come up through the lair of the Lion<br>
          With love in her luminous eyes.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is possible that my own indiscretion may have produced the catastrophe. I may have
    let my mother know that I was happy by the tone of my letters. In any case, her suspicions
    were aroused. Uncle Tom appeared upon the scene. Got Douglas out of the way by some lie,
    rifled his belongings, stole his private letters and dismissed him. But it was too late;
    my eyes were opened and I had become as a god, knowing good and evil. I was in a position
    to take the initiative. Till them, I could only aim at escaping from the hideous hell of
    home. Now I had an objective; now I could attack.</p>
    <p>I must explain something of the horror of life in my mother's house. To begin with, I
    was entirely debarred from the society of boys and girls of my own age, unless they were
    the children of Brethren. The sect was already moribund and in addition had split over the
    Raven heresy. The situation is illustrated by the story which I will quote from the
    preface to my <em>The World's Tragedy</em>.</p>
    <p>An irreligious man may have moral checks; a Plymouth Brother has none. He is always
    ready to excuse the vilest crimes by quoting the appropriate text and invoking the name of
    Christ to cover every meanness which may delight his vain and vicious nature. For the
    Plymouth Brethren were in themselves an exceptionally detestable crew. The aristocrats who
    began the movement were, of course, just aristocrats, and their curious system left them
    so. But they ran a form of &quot;Early Christian&quot; spiritual socialism by having no
    appointed priest or minister, and they were foolish enough to favour their followers
    financially.</p>
    <p>Thus Mr. Giblets --- let us call him --- the third-best butcher in the village found
    (on the one hand) that while at church he was nobody at all, and in chapel but an elder,
    in the little meeting in the squire's morning-room he was no less than the minister of God
    and the mouthpiece of the Holy Ghost; just as on the other hand it was only natural that
    the orders from the Hall should come his way and leave the first-best butcher lamenting
    and the second-best bewildered. So that in my time the sect (though it is only fair to
    point out that they refused to be described as a sect, since what they had done was not to
    form a new sect, but to &quot;Come out of Sect&quot; --- this they maintained in spite of
    the fact that they were far more</p>
    <p>{76}</p>
    <p>exclusive than any other religious body in Europe) was composed of a few of the old
    guard, my father the last of them all, and the meanest crew of canaille that ever
    wriggled.</p>
    <p>With my father's death the small schisms which had hitherto lopped off a few members
    every year or two were altogether surpassed by the great Raven heresy, which split the
    body into two nearly equal halves and extinguished the last sparks of its importance.</p>
    <p>I am going beyond my subject, but I cannot refrain from telling the awful story of the
    meeting at Oban.</p>
    <p>The meeting at Oban consisted of a Mr. Cameron and his wife and the bedridden mother of
    one of the two, I forget which. Now as it is written &quot;Wheresoever two or three are
    gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them&quot;, it was all very well:
    but two forms a quorum. Jesus will not come for less. This has never been disputed by any
    doctor of the Brethren. Wigram is clear on the point; if Darby had ever been clear on any
    point, it would have been on that. Kelly never denied it; even Stuart was sound in this
    matter, and Stoney himself (though reluctantly) gave his adhesion. To hold a meeting you
    must have two persons present . . .</p>
    <p>Well, I need hardly say that Mr. and Mrs. Cameron took opposite sides of the
    controversy. When the glad wires flashed the message that Mr. Raven in the meeting at
    Ealing had deliberately said with slow and weighty emphasis, &quot;He that hath the Son
    hath eternal life&quot;, Mrs. Cameron almost wept for joy. When (the message continued)
    Major McArthy had risen to his feet and retorted, &quot;He that hath the Son of God hath
    everlasting life&quot;, Mr. Cameron executed a Highland through funeral fling<strong>1</strong>.</p>
    <p>When Mr. Raven, stung to the quick, had shaken his fist at the major and yelled,
    &quot;Brother, you're a sinful old man!&quot; Mrs. Cameron &quot;had always known there
    was something&quot;, and invented a ruined governess. But --- oh the laughter of her
    husband when the telegraph brought the major's retort, &quot;Brother, have you no
    sin?&quot; --- spoken with an accent of mildness which belied the purple of his face.</p>
    <p>In short, the meeting at Oban had split. Mr. Cameron had withdrawn from the Lord's
    supper!!! It was therefore absolutely necessary for both of them to assure themselves that
    the bedridden mother was of their way of thinking, or neither could hold the morning
    meeting; though I suppose either could preach the gospel --- <em>morosa voluptas!</em></p>
    <p>Unhappily, that excellent lady was a hard case. She was quite deaf and</p>
    <p>{77}</p>
    <p>very nearly blind; while mentally she had never been remarkable for anything beyond a
    not unamiable imbecility. However, there was but one thing to be done, to argue her into
    conviction.</p>
    <p>They agreed to take eight-hour shifts; and for all I know, they are arguing still, and
    neither of the meetings at Oban can meet!</p>
    <p>As it happened, my mother took the minority view. This means that she cut herself off
    from every single intimate friend. On the strength of a text in one of the epistles, she
    refused to shake hands with anyone who was teaching false doctrine. The very few remaining
    were new friends. My associates could therefore be counted on the fingers of one hand and
    our only bond of sympathy was a detestation of our tyrants.</p>
    <p>My intellectual avidity was enormous, yet I was absolutely cutoff from literature. One
    or two books of Scott and Dickens were permitted. Ballantyne was approved, G. A. Henty
    winked at rather than openly tolerated. <em>David Copperfield</em> was barred because of
    Little Em'ly, for she was a naughty girl; besides, Emily was my mother's name, and to read
    the book might diminish my respect for her. One of my tutors brought down <em>The Bab
    Ballads</em>, one of which begins:</p>
    <p align="center">Emily Jane was a nursery maid.</p>
    <p>My mother threw the book out of the house and very nearly threw him after it. Another
    tutor read &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot; aloud after dinner one night and my mother,
    after delivering a stormy tirade, snatched me from the contamination of his presence. The
    reason was that when the Ancient Mariner saw the water snakes playing around the ship, he
    &quot;blessed them unaware&quot;. An outrageously blasphemous act, for snakes are cursed
    in Genesis!</p>
    <p>Here, by the way, is a curious point. These bigots are so inconsistent that I have
    never been able to follow the working of their minds. There is a great deal of doctrine in
    &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot; which outrages every tenet of the Plymouth Brethren, but
    my mother does not appear to have taken offence at that. My only suggestion is that she
    detested snakes for Freudian reasons; she had probably met them in dreams and had
    therefore good reason (from her point of view) for identifying them with the devil in his
    most objectionable form. My mother was naturally a rather sensual type of woman and there
    is not doubt that sexual repression had driven her as nearly as possible to the borders of
    insanity.</p>
    <p>My cousin Agnes had a house in Dorset Square. My mother took me to tea there one
    afternoon. A copy of <em>Dr. Pascal</em> was in the room. The word &quot;Zola&quot; caught
    my mother's eye and she made a verbal assault of hysterical fury upon her hostess. Both
    women shouted and screamed at each other simultaneously, amid floods of tears. Needless to
    say, my mother had never read a line of Zola --- the name was simply a red rag to a cow.</p>
    <p>{78}</p>
    <p>This inconsistency, by the way, seems universal. I have known a printer object to set
    up &quot;We gave them hell and Tommy&quot;, while passing unquestioned all sorts of things
    to which exception could quite reasonably be taken by narrow-minden imbeciles. The censor
    habitually passes what I, who am no puritan, consider nauseating filth, while refusing to
    license <em>Oedipus Rex</em>, which we are compelled to assimilate at school. The country
    is flooded with the nasty pornography of women writers, while there is an outcry against
    epoch-making masterpieces of philosophy like <em>Jurgen</em>. The salacious musical comedy
    goes its libidinous way rejoicing, while Ibsen and Bernard Shaw are on the black list. The
    fact is, of course, that the puritan has been turned by sexual repression into a sexual
    pervert and degenerate, so that he is insane on the subject.</p>
    <p>Of course, I could not be prevented entirely from reading. I was kept very short of
    pocket money, so that I could not even buy books to any extent. But I used to get them now
    and again, smuggle them into the house inside my clothes, and lock myself into the
    water-closet to read them. One such book, I remember, was <em>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</em>.
    My mother considered the hansom cab as an engine specially devised by the devil and any
    reference to one was considered obscene.</p>
    <p>Having given an idea of the atmosphere of home, it should be intelligible that I was
    prepared to go out of my way to perform any act which might serve as a magical affirmation
    of my revolt. I was, in fact, restrained from developing my mind in any wholesome manner.
    I had no opportunity to think of anything but fighting fire with fire.</p>
    <p>A new parlour maid took it into her head to better herself by getting a stranglehold on
    the young master. I arranged to meet her on her evening out at a safe distance from
    Streatham and we drove in a cab over to Herne Hill, indulging in a mild flirtation on the
    way. On Sunday morning, however, I brought things to a point. I made an excuse for staying
    away from the morning meeting, got the girl into my mother's bedroom and made my magical
    affirmation. I had no idea that there was any counterplot, but the girl proceeded to
    &quot;blow the gaff&quot;. She was, of course, instantly flung into the street, but she
    continued her operations for bettering herself. Uncle Tom intervened, for of course my
    mother could not discuss such a subject with me at all. I denied the whole affair point
    blank. My uncle tried to find the cabman, but failed. They scented trouble for somebody
    and knew no more than so many Chinamen. He begged me, however, to try to furnish some
    positive proof of my innocence; and this is where my subtlety came in. I pretended to be
    in great trepidation. Yes, I could prove it, and yet, how could I? My uncle scented a
    mystery and adjourned the examination.</p>
    <p>I immediately went out and appealed to the tobacconist on the bridge</p>
    <p>{79}</p>
    <p>above Streatham station to say, if asked, that he remembered my having been in his shop
    on the Thursday night previous, which was that of the cab drive. He was a good sportsman
    and naturally anxious to oblige. I went back to my uncle and proposed a deal. I would tell
    him where I had been, but he must not punish me, for I had been led astray by bad
    companions. He was only too glad; and I owned up, tremulous and tearful, that I had been
    in the tobacconist's. He would have doubted a merely innocent alibi. The girl was, of
    course, discredited, and nothing more was heard of the matter. And I had had her on my
    mother's very bed!</p>
    <p>That is the state of affairs which is caused by puritanism. First we have a charming
    girl driven to attempt blackmail, next a boy forced to the most unmanly duplicity in order
    to exercise his natural rights with impunity, and incidentally to wrong a woman for whom
    he had nothing but the friendliest feelings. As long as sexual relations are complicated
    by religious, social and financial considerations, so long will they cause all kinds of
    cowardly, dishonourable and disgusting behaviour. When war conditions imposed artificial
    restraint on the sister appetite of hunger, decent citizens began to develop all kinds of
    loathsome trickery. Men and women will never behave worthily as long as current morality
    interferes with the legitimate satisfaction of physiological needs. Nature always avenges
    herself on those who insult her. The individual is not to blame for the crime and insanity
    which are the explosions consequent on the clogging of the safety valve. The fault lies
    with the engineer. At the present moment, society is blowing up in larger or smaller spots
    all over the world, because it has failed to develop a system by which all its members can
    be adequately nourished without conflict and the waste products eliminated without
    discomfort.</p>
    <p>On the whole, I was so well guarded that incidents like the above were rate accidents.
    I had been taught by bitter experience that almost anybody might be a spy, so that the
    slightest indiscretion in talking to an apparently harmless stranger might result in some
    disaster. The foundations were laid of an exaggerated shyness which has never left me. I
    was practically debarred from human intercourse, even that of the great men of the past.
    My only consolation was writing poetry.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to explain by what means I came to the conclusion that poetry was of
    paramount importance. There was a sort of family tradition which honoured the poet; but it
    was as irrational as the rest of their beliefs. I can only imagine it as derived from
    their having been told at school that the English poets were the glory of humanity, for
    they certainly knew no poetry beyond &quot;Casabianca&quot; and &quot;We are Seven&quot;.
    I discovered Shakespeare for myself. It happened that in the farmhouse at Forsinard were
    three old folio volumes. My mother had an edition of Shakespeare; but I had never read it,
    because it was permitted. At the farmhouse, however, there was nothing else</p>
    <p>{80}</p>
    <p>to read. I became fascinated and spent night after night poring over the pages. (I have
    always been singularly thorough in anything I take up. My father had a favourite sermon on
    the word &quot;but&quot;; and I went through the whole Bible, page by page, enclosing this
    word, wherever it occurred, with an oblong of ink.)</p>
    <p>Apart from the few regular pieces for recitation, there was <em>Paradise Lost</em>.
    This bored me for the most part as much as it does now, but allowed me to gloat over the
    figures of Satan and sin. After all, Milton was a great poet; and the subconscious
    artistic self of him was therefore bitterly antagonistic to Christianity. Not only is
    Satan the hero, but the triumphant hero. God's threats have not &quot;come off&quot;. It
    is the forces of evil, so called, that manifest in strength and beauty of form. The
    glories of the saints are tinsel. It is impossible to draw goodness with character. On the
    Christian theory, goodness is, in fact, nothing but absence of character, for it implies
    complete submission to God. Satan's original fault is not pride; that is secondary. It
    springs from the consciousness of separateness. Now of course this is, mystically
    speaking, sinful, because the mystic holds that all manifestation is imperfection.
    Christian theology has not had sufficient logic to see, like its elder sister, Hindu
    theology, that any attributes soever must distinguish their possessor from some other
    possible being. But their instinct has been to go as far in that direction as possible and
    consequently the divine characters in Milton are comparatively colourless. Such was the
    transmutation in the nature of God effected by building a super-structure of Greek
    philosophy upon the foundation of the savage phantasm of Jehovah. My own attitude in the
    matter is to be seen in my aesthetic tendencies. I could never tolerate smooth, insipid
    beauty. The ugliness of decrepitude revolted me; but that of strength absorbed my whole
    soul. I despised the tame scenery of the Swiss lakes; the ruggedness of barren pinnacles
    of rock and the gloomy isolation of such lakes as Llyn Idwal appealed to my imagination.
    Wastwater disappointed me. It did not come up to the level of its poetic reputation. It
    was only when I got among the crags themselves that I was happy. I demanded to be at grips
    with death in one way or another. The bourgeois ambition to get through life without
    unpleasantness seemed to me the lowest vileness and entirely in keeping with the moral
    attitude of the heavenly people in <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</p>
    <p>I was allowed to read Tennyson and Longfellow, but it is impossible to class them as
    poets. The emasculation of all the characters disgusted me beyond measure. Their very sins
    are suburban.</p>
