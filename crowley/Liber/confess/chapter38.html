    <p>I left Paiyu with about twenty coolies on the ninth of June. A very short distance
    brings one to the snout of the glacier, black, greasy and nearly five hundred feet high at
    the lowest point. The Bralduh rushes from a cavern very repulsively. A great many
    phenomena observed on this expedition impress one with a kind of horror. I used to think
    ti utterly absurd in books of travel to see moral qualities associated with nature. At
    this period of my life, above all, I should have scouted any such idea; but, through the
    classes of memory, one can analyse oneself beyond one's protestations. This muddy torrent
    issuing from its vast black source certainly created an ugly impression. The reason maybe
    that stopping, as I naturally did, to have a good look at it, the presence of that vast
    body of ice produced a slight physical chill which I promptly translated into emotional
    terms and attribute wrongly to what I saw instead of to what I felt. There is also
    probably a strong Freudian element; to cold, black muddiness of the water and its
    relentless turmoil, its unstaunchability, so to speak, may suggest the flowing of blood
    from a wound, or some such disease as nephritis. The general tone of the blackness of the
    debris is peculiarly unsympathetic.</p>
    <p>There was no difficulty in finding a way up the snout. I knew that the first camp,
    Liligo, was on the left bank, so moved over in that direction. (German professors two
    hundred years hence are requested not to confuse the name of this <em>parau</em> with the
    &quot;little-go&quot; at Cambridge, though both are alike first stages on a lonely climb
    leading to nowhere.)</p>
    <p>The glacier was a complete revelation to me. The difference in scale had merely
    multiplied one's difficulty accordingly in previous matters; but there they become more
    formidable in a geometrical progression with a big <em>f</em>. In Switzerland one does not
    seem any moraines over a hundred feet high. Here they run to a thousand or fifteen hundred
    feet. There are something like twenty tributary glaciers feeding the Baltoro. Each of
    these contributes at least three moraines. The glacier being about thirty miles long, and
    rarely more than two wide, it is distinctly a congested district! The competing moraines
    jostle each other unscrupulously. One would hardly know that one was on ice at all for the
    first ten miles; there is hardly a bare patch. But the close competition tends to form
    many steep slopes; and this means that the sides of most of the moraines are covered with
    rocks which, even when they are of enormous size, are in extremely unstable equilibrium.
    Again,</p>
    <p>{308}</p>
    <p>the pressure and temperature combine to loosen the bands of rock and ice. The general
    result is that the passage of a party rearranges that section of the glacier much more
    radically than would be the case in the Alps. The task of picking one's way is very
    arduous; and there is a good deal of luck about it, for there is no means of telling
    whether one may not at any moment be cut off by an obstacle. For example --- the rivulets
    which flow openly through small channels on Swiss glaciers may here be torrents rushing
    through cuttings in the ice anything up to a hundred feet broad and deep. In the Alps, I
    remember few such places where I could not step across easily, and those few were always
    within a bit of a jump.</p>
    <p>One's eyesight does not help one much to find the way. The view is always cut off; even
    by climbing to the top of a moraine one gets little practical information. The muddle is
    essentially meaningless to the mountaineer. It is quite rare to be able to mark down a
    comparatively level passage of a couple of hundred yards which might be worth while making
    for. Each line of moraine has to be crossed in the serious spirit of a pioneer looking for
    a pass across a range. The instability of the surface means a constant tendency to slip,
    so that the journey is morally tedious and physically wearisome beyond belief. The
    compensation is the majesty of the surrounding mountains. Nowhere else in the world does
    there exist anything like the same diversity of form. The effect is enhanced by the
    recognition that practically every peak is unclimbable by our present standards. Men
    accustomed to mountains instinctively reconnoitre everything they see, and in this
    district one is constantly being astonished at the completeness of the defences of even
    quite insignificant peaks.</p>
    <p>Above the camp at Liligo are most formidable precipices of rotten rock. In some places
    they actually overhang; and one wonders how they manage to stay there at all, especially
    in view of the rapidly disintegrating action of the weather.</p>
    <p>The next day I went on to Rhobutse; a very short march, but I did not want to tire the
    men, and this was the only good camping place for some distance. There was a great deal of
    snow and rain in the early part of the day, though it cleared up in the afternoon. Just
    after sunset, however, a very violent wind sprang up. On the eleventh, I went on to
    Rdokass, a much longer march in distance. But the going on the glacier had become much
    easier. I found some comparatively level stretches.</p>
    <p>The natives were extremely good in every way; their character compares favourably with
    that of any race I have ever seen. We never heard of them coming to blows or even to
    really high words. Imagine the difference with European peasants! Some of their customs
    are worth mentioning. For one thing, they never take off their clothes all their lives. A
    baby is wrapped in a rag; presently a second round the first, and so on. But they never
    remove</p>
    <p>{309}</p>
    <p>the innermost layer; it is allowed to disintegrate by itself. The richer a man becomes,
    the more clothes he is able to buy, so that the headmen of a village are like rolls of
    cloth.</p>
    <p>Their method of preparing their food on the glacier is ingenious. Having made a fire,
    they get a stone as nearly round as possible and heat it thoroughly through. Round this
    they smear their paste of flour and water, twisting the while into their shawls. By the
    time they have arrived in camp the paste is baked through and still hot.</p>
    <p>One cannot wash on the glacier --- nay, not so much as one''s hands. The extreme
    dryness of the atmosphere removes all the natural grease of the skin, which becomes so
    brittle that the touch of water causes it to peel of, leaving a horribly painful, and
    practically unhealable, wound. It let my hands get as greasy and as dirty as I could to
    protect them. When thus coated, it is safe to leave them in contact with water, provided
    it is not for too long and there is no rubbing. One can indeed put one's hands into
    boiling water, for at these low barometric pressures water boils easily. At Rodkass, for
    example, water boils at 87.4°, corresponding to 13,904 feet; higher up, it is of course
    less.</p>
    <p>In spite of not washing, one does not get at all dirty. After my bath on May 25th, I
    abstained until August 19th --- eighty-five days --- but I found myself absolutely clean
    except my hands and face. The only inconvenience was lice. These insects live inexpugnably
    in the seams of one's clothes. It is useless to try to dislodge them, because every time
    one gets near a Balti, the supply is renewed.</p>
    <p>Rdokass remains to this day in my memory as a veritable Geulah. It is a broad grassy
    ledge on the rocks two or three hundred feet above the glacier. There are superb views in
    every direction. But there is &quot;something about the place&quot; beyond that; the
    atmosphere of restfulness is paramount. There was here quite a lot of grass; even some
    flowers. I accordingly sent word to bring our flocks along. It was the last oasis of any
    account and in fact the only place of its kind that we found on the whole glacier. The day
    after, I crossed the glacier to Lhungka. It was a very nervous business picking one's way
    across the moraines, especially as I had to build stone men to guide the other parties,
    and I had only the vaguest ideas as to what point on the other bank of the glacier to make
    for. I climbed a high point in the middle and took compass observations, as I could now
    see Masherbrum (25,660 feet) and Gusherbrum (26,630 feet). These peaks are the most
    spectacular of the whole range; the one as stupendous wedge of brilliantly lighted rock
    and ice; the other a dim luminous cone. It had this appearance because of its orientation.
    We never saw it in full light; because at sunset, when it would have been illuminated, it
    happened always to be cloudy.</p>
    <p>My compass observations distressed me extremely. I was trying to reconcile</p>
    <p>{310}</p>
    <p>nature with Conway's map; and my difficulties were scarcely less than those which
    disturbed the peace of Victorian theologians. The natives made it worse; for Conway had
    named the glaciers on their information, and what they told me was in some respects quite
    different.</p>
    <p>At Lhungka I built a shelter for the coolies, a low stone wall behind which they could
    lie in case of violent wind. It would of course have been impossible to take tents for
    them; but as a matter of fact they did not complain of cold at any time. The thermometer
    did not register more than five degrees centigrade of frost till after June 19th.</p>
    <p>The next day I want on to Ghore, where I found a delightful camping ground of fine
    level sand. (On our return, by the way, this was completely flooded.)</p>
    <p>From Ghore to Biange is another long march, but less monotonous. The views are
    increasingly superb and the solitude was producing its beneficent results. The utterly
    disproportionate minuteness of man purges him of his smug belief in himself as the final
    cause of nature. The effect is to produce not humiliation but humility, and this feeling
    is only the threshold of a selfishness which restores the balance by identifying one with
    the universe of which one's physical basis is so imperceptibly insignificant a fraction.</p>
    <p>From Biange one can see Mitre Peak across the glacier. Although a relatively minor
    summit (7,500 metres), its architecture is incomparable. The name is inevitable. From this
    point of view the double horn could not fail to suggest the title (I had myself indulged
    in a little nomenclature, calling a mountain crowned by three square-cut towers of rock
    &quot;Three Castles&quot;.)</p>
    <p>The next day a short march took me to Doksam. I was now almost at the head of the
    Baltoro glacier (15,518 feet). In nearly thirty miles of march I had only made four
    hundred feet of ascent. But here I was on the floor of a glacier at a height close to that
    of Mont Blanc. In front of me the glacier widened out; three major and several minor
    glaciers coalesced. I was irresistibly reminded of the Concordia Platz in the Oberland and
    named the plateau in affectionate remembrance.</p>
    <p>Once again the astounding variety of nature in this district impressed itself upon my
    mind. One would have said that it was theoretically impossible to combine so many types of
    mountain. The obvious exception to the otherwise invariable rule of practical
    inaccessibility was the Golden Throne, a minor point of which Conway claims to have
    climbed. I was very disgusted at the bad taste of some of the coolies who had been with
    him in saying that he had never been on the mountain at all, but turned back at the foot
    of the ice fall. How could such common creatures presume to decide a delicate scientific
    question of this sort?</p>
    <p>My camp at Doksam was pitched on the borders of a good-sized lake</p>
    <p>{311}</p>
    <p>between the mountains and the glacier, which at this point presents a wall of ice well
    over a thousand feet high. The position is consequently comparatively sheltered and in its
    way very agreeable. The presence of still water lends it the charm of utter peace, and the
    absence of the vermin which desecrate the crust of the earth so objectionably in other
    places is rendered even more agreeable by the holly courageous children who were my
    comrades and my friends. I went out reconnoitering for three hours in the middle of the
    day and got a very clear idea of the situation. A sudden snowstorm of a rather severe type
    swept the camp for an hour; but at four o'clock the weather again cleared. &quot;Tomorrow
    to fresh woods an pastures new&quot; --- except that there were neither woods nor
    pastures! &quot;We were the first that ever burst into that silent sea&quot; --- except
    that there wasn't any sea! The poets are really very thoughtless to leave their heir
    without an appropriate quotation!</p>
    <p>On the sixteenth of June I marched for a little over four hours where man had never yet
    trodden. It proved to be the easiest going yet. The eternal moraine was less in evidence;
    we were able to walk over admirable snow most of the way. Once more, though, I have to
    record a unique phenomenon totally out of keeping with the rest. At the corner of the
    Baltoro glacier and its northern affluent, the Chogo Lungma, as I named it, one has to
    cross a scree of pure white marble. Eckenstein, who arrived at this point in a snowstorm,
    found it very distressing. He told me that it was impossible to pick footholds; the entire
    surface was a blinding glare. Camp 8 (16,592 feet) is situated at the foot of a subsidiary
    spur descending from the ridge of which Chogo Ri is the climax. I was now in full view of
    the mountain itself, bar clouds; and, my first duty being to reconnoitre the mountain, I
    spent all day and all night watching it through my glasses, sketch-book in hand. The
    clouds shifted sufficiently to enable me to make a piecemeal picture, and I came to
    conclusion that while the south face, perhaps possible theoretically, meant a complicated
    climb with no half-way house, there should be no difficulty in walking up the snow slopes
    on the east-south-east to the snowy shoulder below the final rock pyramid. I sent back
    word accordingly and went on much encouraged. There was still not difficulty of any kind;
    the snow was excellent; but after three and a half hours, I decided to stop at Camp 9
    (17,332 feet) directly under the south face of the mountain. Above this camp the glacier
    becomes comparatively steep and I did not wish to take a change of getting my coolies into
    trouble. They had amused me very much, by the way, at Camp 8 before starting, by coming
    and telling me that of course they didn't believe me when I said I would send them back as
    soon as they got to the eastern foot of Chogo Ri. They knew quite well that I only said it
    to lure them on; they knew that I meant to make them cross to Yarkand; they knew that they</p>
    <p>{312}</p>
    <p>would die to a man; but they didn't mind, it was Kismet, and they wanted me to know
    that they would gladly die because I had been so nice to them. When I sent them home from
    Camp 10 they could hardly believe their ears, and their delight at being reprieved was
    pathetically charming.</p>
    <p>Modern writers have made a great deal of fun of the golden age; they have been at great
    pains to prove that primitive man is a bloodthirsty savage. The Balti gives them the lie.
    These men were all innocence, all honesty, all good faith, all loyalty, all human
    kindness. They were absolutely courageous and cheerful, even in face of that they supposed
    to be certain death of a most uncomfortable kind. They had no disquietude about death and
    no distaste for life. They were simple-minded and merry. It was impossible not to love
    them, and not to contrast them with the dirty despicable insects whose squabbles and
    crimes make civilization itself the greatest of all crimes, and whose ignorance (for all
    their boasting) is actually darker and deeper and more deadly than that of these children.</p>
    <p>From Camp 9 there is a rapid rise of fourteen hundred feet to Camp 10 (18,733 feet). I
    was a little doubtful as to how the pabu of the men would behave. Pabu are a kind of
    footgear which reminds one of a gouty man. Straw or rags are wrapped round the feet by
    thongs of raw hide. Their softness enables the wearer to get excellent hold on moraine,
    and they protect the feet from cold very effectively. The question was whether they would
    not slip on the hard snow. I was consequently very careful to pick the easiest way and to
    scrape large steps when necessary. I took the first few men up on a rope, explaining the
    use of it, and told them how to keep their eyes skinned for concealed crevasses. They were
    highly intelligent; picked up the trick of everything without argument or complaint, and
    made no mistakes.</p>
    <p>I ought to mention their ingenious defence against snow blindness. They wear their hair
    rather long, and them make a plaited fringe to hand gown over their eyes like a curtain.
    The device does not sound very effective; but it seems to work. It is at least a fact that
    we did not have a single case. On Kangchenjunga, where this plan is not known, a number of
    the men were seriously affected.</p>
    <p>I was blamed subsequently for my selection of Camp 10 as main camp. Eckenstein thought
    that I might have chosen a more sheltered position. But there were no such positions in
    the neighbourhood and it was quite useless to go further away from the foot of the slopes
    which it was my intention to climb. Furthermore, during my ten days on the glacier, I had
    experienced all sorts of weather, and none of it had given the slightest ground for
    supposing that we were likely to meet any conditions which would make camp 10 other than a
    desirable country residence for a gentleman in failing health. My principal preoccupation,
    moreover, was to keep</p>
    <p>{313}</p>
    <p>out of the way of avalanches and falling stones. I had already seen enough of the
    apparently arbitrary conduct which one might expect from them; I thought it best therefore
    to choose a level spot in the middle of the glacier.</p>
    <p>Even as it was, there was an avalanche on the tenth of July which snowed both on Camp
    10 and Camp 11. Avalanches at this altitude --- and in this latitude --- differ
    (nevertheless) from those on lower peaks. Snow does not melt at all unless subjected to
    pressure. It evaporates without melting. It never forms a compact mass with a hard crust
    as it does in the Alps. I have seen ten feet of freshly fallen snow disappear completely
    in the course of an hour's sunshine. Extraordinary as it sounds, despite the perpetual bad
    weather which we experienced, the snow on the lower glacier (between Camps 9 and 7) had
    completely disappeared in August, while that on the upper glacier had very much increased.</p>
    <p>As a result of these conditions, a first-rate avalanche may never reach the foot of the
    slope down which it starts; it may evaporate almost entirely en route. One of our
    photographs shows an avalanche actually in the process of falling. It would have
    overwhelmed the photographer under Alpine conditions.</p>
    <p>I must admit to a certain heaviness of heart in obeying my instructions and sending
    back the men. It was so obviously right to take them up the slopes to the shoulder and
    establish the camp at a point whence Chogo Ri could have been reached without question,
    given one fine day. But my orders were formal and I never thought of disobedience. Of
    course, if I had foreseen the volte-face of the weather, I might have decided otherwise.</p>
    <p>I was a little worried by the failure of Pfannl and Wessely to maintain the
    communications for which arrangements had been made. I could not see their party on the
    glacier below and wondered whether they had not broken loose. It was just the sort of
    thing that one might expect; to find that they had bolted up the south end of the mountain
    and spoilt the whole plan. They arrived, however, on the next day, the nineteenth, and on
    the twentieth Knowles and the doctor joined us. They arrived in a snowstorm which
    continued the whole day. It was the first of uninterruptedly bad weather. On the
    twenty-first the wind dropped, though the snow continued. It tried to clear up on the
    twenty-second; and the twenty-third was fine. But of course, nothing could be done in the
    absence of Eckenstein. On the twenty-fourth a blizzard begin. It was the most furious wind
    that I have ever known. A corner of my tent broke loose; and the only remedy was to sit on
    it the whole morning! The violence of the wind was indeed amazing. I had secured the side
    ropes of my tent by tying them round square kiltas and putting others on top. There was
    thus over one hundred pounds to</p>
    <p>{314}</p>
    <p>hold down each rope; but the wind made no bones about shifting them. The twenty-fifth
    was a dull doubtful day; and on the twenty-sixth the weather was rather worse. On the
    twenty-seventh it cleared up in the afternoon and Eckenstein arrived with fresh meat and
    bread.</p>
