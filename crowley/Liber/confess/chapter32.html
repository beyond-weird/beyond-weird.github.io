    <p>On the twenty-fifth of January we left Rangoon for Prome. Arrived at Prome, we
    immediately went on board the steam ferry <em>Amherst</em>. It is a five hours' journey to
    Thayetmyo, where we arrived in the heat of the day, after a very pleasant journey, thanks
    partly to the beauty of the scenery, but perhaps more to the geniality of the captain. We
    got three bullock carts for our transport and started the next morning, stopping at Natha
    for lunch after a pleasant journey of ten miles. After lunch we went off to Kyoukghyi.</p>
    <p>The next day we resumed our journey; I walked most of the way and shot some partridges
    and pigeons for lunch, which we took at Leh-Joung; this isbungalow, but a not a village.
    We went on in the afternoon to Yegyanzin, fortune to meet Garr, where we had the good the
    forest commissioner of theUnfortunately he was unable district, and his assistant Hopwood.
    to giveto have no difficulty in getting me any elephants, as they were all in use; but
    told me I ought coolies and probably ponies if I required them. Weforces and had quite a
    nice dinner combined together. One does not realizeuntil one meets them in how nice
    Englishmen really are out-of-the-way places. Sometimes not even then.</p>
    <p>The following day we went off again and arrived in Mindon at two thirty p.m. The road
    had become very bad; and, in the springless bullock cart, travelling was by no means
    pleasant. In fact, after two or three big jolts we agreed to take turns to look out, and
    to give warning if a particularly frightful jolt seemed imminent. But for all our
    precautions, I was badly let in on one occasion. The road had become level, and appeared
    to be the same for the next two hundred yards, so I turned back to light a pipe. Without a
    word of warning the driver swung round his oxen off the road into an adjoining paddy
    field, at least three feet below, and we got the nastiest shaking of our lives. The last
    seven miles were particularly irritating, as there was little or no shade, and it was out
    of the question to relieve oneself by walking for more than a short distance.</p>
    <p>On arrival at Mindon, we summoned the headman and told him to get men for the
    cross-country journey to Kyaukpyu. He seemed to think it would be rather difficult and was
    evidently not at all pleased with his orders, but he went of to obey them, and in the
    meanwhile sent round the village shikari so that I might go out after buffalo the next
    day. I accordingly started at six forty-five next morning.</p>
    <p>It soon began to get hot, and a double `577 is not the kind of toy one wants</p>
    <p>{266}</p>
    <p>to carry on a fifteen-mile tramp. As a matter of fact, I probably did nearer twenty
    miles than fifteen, as I was going eight hours with very little rest. We went up and down
    hills repeatedly, but thee wild buffalo was shy, and, as a matter of fact, I did not the
    whole day see anything whatever shootable, except some small birds which I took home for
    dinner. In the afternoon we went off bathing together in a delightful pool directly under
    the hill on which the bungalow was situated. I took down the shout gun with the intention
    of killing a big paddy bird which we saw from the bank. These birds are valuable on
    account of the aigrette. I fired, but my shot did not seem to hurt him, and he flew off. I
    resigned the gun to the Burmese boy, and had just finished my bath when the impudent beast
    came back. I hastily signalled for the gun; and putting on a topee and a towel round my
    waist proceeded to stalk him across the ford. I must have presented the most ridiculous
    spectacle. Thornton said he had not laughed so much for years, and I daresay that the
    paddy bird laughed too; but I got the best laugh in the end, for after about ten minutes'
    infinite pains I got a close shot at him, which put an end to his career. That evening we
    tried to eat roast parrots, but it was a total failure. I am told, however, that parrot
    pie is quite a good dish; well, I don't like parrot, so there will be all the more for
    those who do.</p>
    <p>The next day I was naturally feeling very tired; but in the afternoon I summoned enough
    energy to go for a short stroll. I was very anxious to show Thornton a beautiful view of a
    hillside and river, which I had come across on my way home. We set out, he being armed
    with a sketch book and a kukri, which he would always carry about with him, though I could
    never understand the reason; if I had been anticipating the day's events, I should not
    have troubled to inquire. At the edge of the hill weariness overtook me; I sat down,
    pointing to him a tiny path down the hill slope which he was to pursue. He was rather a
    long time returning, and I was just about to follow in search when I heard his cooee; in a
    couple of minutes he rejoined me. I was rather surprised to see that his kukri was covered
    with blood. I said, &quot;I knew you would fall over something one day. Where have you cut
    yourself?&quot; He explained that he had not cut himself, but that an animal had tried to
    dispute the path with him and that he had hit it on the head, whereon the animal had
    rolled down the steep slopes towards the river. I could not make out from his description
    what kind of an animal it could possibly be, but on examining the tracks I saw them to be
    those of a nearly full-grown leopard. We did not retrieve the body, though it must have
    been mortally wounded, otherwise Thornton would hardly have escaped so easily.</p>
    <p>The headman now returned and told us that he could not give us coolies to cross the
    Arakan Hills, nobody had ever been there, and it was very dangerous, and everyone who went
    there died, and all that sort of thing. But</p>
    <p>{267}</p>
    <p>he could give us men to go about twenty miles, and no doubt we should be able to get
    more coolies there. I thought there was more than a little doubt; and, taking one thing
    with another, decided it would be best to give up the idea and go instead back to the
    Irrawaddy down the Mindon Chong; we consequently hired a boat of the dug-out type, about
    thirty-five feet long and just broad enough for two men to pass; over the middle of the
    boat was the usual awning. The next morning we started down the stream, always through the
    most delightful country and among charming people. All the villages in this part of the
    country are strongly fortified with palisades of sharpened bamboos. The voyage down the
    river was exceedingly pleasant and the shooting delightful. One could sit on the stern of
    the boat and pot away all day at everything, from snipe to heron. Our Burmese boys and the
    kites had great rivalry in retrieving the game. The kites seemed to know that they would
    not be shot at. I had another slight attack of fever in the afternoon, but nothing to
    speak of. We tied up at Sakade for the night. There was no dak bungalow near and one does
    not sleep in a Burmese village unless necessity compels. And yet</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>By palm and pagoda enchaunted o'ershadowed, I lie in the light<br>
      Of stars that are bright beyond suns that all poets have vaunted<br>
      In the deep-breathing amorous bosom of forests of Amazon might,<br>
      By palm and pagoda enchaunted.</p>
      <p>By spells that are murmured, and rays of my soul strongly flung,<br>
      never daunted;<br>
      By gesture and tracery traced with a wand dappled white,<br>
      I summon the spirits of earth from the gloom they for ages have<br>
      haunted.</p>
      <p>O woman of deep red skin! Carved hair like the teak! O delight<br>
      Of my soul in the hollows of earth --- how my spirit hath taunted . . .<br>
      Away! I am here, I am laid to the breast of the earth in the dusk<br>
      of the night,<br>
      By palm and pagoda enchaunted.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This poem was inspired by an actual experience. The effects of my continued bouts of
    fever had been to make me spiritually sensitive. The jungle spoke to me of the world which
    lies behind material manifestation. I perceived directly that every phenomenon, from the
    ripple of the river to the fragrance of the flowers, is the language by which the subtle
    souls of nature speak to our senses. That night we were tied up under a teak tree, and as
    I lay awake with my eyes fixed ecstatically on its grace and vigour, I found myself in the
    embraces of the Nat or elemental spirit of the tree. It was a woman vigorous and intense,
    of passion and purity so marvellous that she abides with me after these many years as few
    indeed of her</p>
    <p>{268}</p>
    <p>human colleagues. I passed a sleepless night in a continuous sublimity of love.</p>
    <p>The early hours of the morning, in winter, are bitterly cold, and the river is covered
    to a height of several feet with a dense white mist which does not disappear till well
    after sunrise.</p>
    <p>I kept very quiet the next day, for repeated attacks of fever had begun to interfere
    with my digestive apparatus. Just as nightfall two deer came down to drink at the river
    side. It was rather dark for a shot and the deer could hardly be distinguished from the
    surrounding foliage, but the men very cleverly and silently held the boat and I let fly.
    The result was better than I expected. I hit exactly where I had aimed at and the deer
    dropped like a stone. Needless to say we had a first-class dinner. We slept at Singon that
    night. There were a great many jungle fires during this day and the next. The next morning
    we started again early and I resumed my bird shooting. On the first day I had several
    times missed a Brahman duck and was somewhat anxious to retrieve my reputation. Quite
    early in the morning I got a very fair shot at one; it shook its wings in derision and
    flew off, landing again a hundred yards or so down stream. We floated down and I had
    another shot with the same result; for the next shot I went on shore and deliberately
    stalked the animal from behind the low bank and got a sitting shot at about ten yards. The
    disgusted bird looked around indignantly and flew solemnly down stream. I, even more
    disgusted, got back to the boat, but the bird was a little too clever this time; for he
    made a wide circle and came flying back right overhead. I let fly from below and it fell
    with a flop into the river. The fact is that these birds are so well protected that it is
    quite useless to shoot at them when the breast is not exposed, unless a lucky pellet
    should find its way to the brain. So on the next occasion, having noticed that when
    disturbed they always went down stream, I went some distance below them and sent two boys
    to frighten them from above. The result was an excellent right and left, and I consoled
    myself for my previous fiascos. We stopped the night at Toun Myong.</p>
    <p>After a delightful night we went off the next morning and got to Kama on the Irrawaddy,
    whence we signalled the steamboat which took us back to Prome, where we stopped that
    night. The next day we spent in visiting the pagoda, Thornton doing some sketching and I
    writing a couple of Buddhist poems. We went off in the evening for Rangoon. The next day
    we drove about the town but did little else; and on Monday we paid off Peter. The
    principle on which I had dealt with this man was to give him money in lump sums as he
    wanted it, and to call him to give an account of all he had spent. He made out that we
    owed him thirty-seven rupees by this said account. I made a few trifling corrections;
    reducing the balance in his favour, and including the wages due to him (which he had not
    reckoned),</p>
    <p>{269}</p>
    <p>to two rupees, four annas. He was very indignant and was going to complain to everyone
    from the lieutenant-governor to the hotel-keeper. I think he was rather staggered when I
    told him that, as he had been a very good servant in other respects, I would give him as
    backsheesh the bottle of champagne and the three tins which he had already stolen. He
    appeared very surprised at my having detected this theft. Whereby hangs a tale. On leaving
    Rangoon I gave him a list of all the provision, with the instructions that when he took
    anything from the store he was to bring the list to me and have that thing crossed off. On
    the second day the list was missing; he, of course, swore that I had not given it back to
    him. I had kept a duplicate list, which I took very good care not to show.</p>
    <p>That evening I was again down with fever and found myself unable to take any food
    whatever. I called in the local medico, who fed me on iced champagne, and the next day I
    was pretty well again. Thornton in the meanwhile had gone off to Mandalay. I was very
    sorry not to be able to go on there with him, but my time was too short: I did not know
    when I might be summoned to join Eckenstein to go off to Kashmir.</p>
    <p>On the twelfth of February I went on board the <em>Komilla</em> for Akyab, where Allan
    was now living. In the course of the day the sea air completely restored me to health. On
    the thirteenth we were off Sandaway, which did not appear fascinating. On the next day we
    put in a Kyakpyu, which I had so vainly hoped to reach overland. It has a most delightful
    bay and beach, its general appearance recalling the South Sea Islands; but the place is a
    den of malaria. We had no time to land, as the captain was anxious to get into Akyab the
    same night. We raced through the straits and cast anchor there about eight o'clock ---
    just in time.</p>
    <p>I went ashore with the second officer and proceeded in my usual casual manner to try to
    find Allan in the dark. The job was easier than I anticipated. The first man I spoke to
    greeted me as if I had been his long-lost brother, and took me off in his own carriage to
    the monastery (the name of which is Lamma Sayadaw Kyoung) where I found Allan, whom I now
    saw for the first time as a Buddhist monk. The effect was to make him appear of gigantic
    height, as compared to the diminutive Burmese, but otherwise there was very little change.
    The old gentleness was still there.</p>
    <p>I ought to have mentioned (when talking of Ceylon) the delightful story of his
    adventure with a krait. Going out for a solitary walk one day with no better weapon than
    an umbrella, be met a krait sunning himself in the middle of the road. Most men would have
    either killed the krait with the umbrella or avoided its dangerous neighbourhood. Allan
    did neither; he went up to the deadly little reptile and loaded him with reproaches. He
    showed him how selfish it was to sit in the road where someone might pass and accidentally
    tread on him. &quot;For I am sure,&quot; said Allan, &quot;that were anyone</p>
    <p>{270}</p>
    <p>to interfere with you, your temper is not sufficiently under control to prevent you
    striking him. Let us see now!&quot; he continued, and deliberately stirred the beast up
    with his umbrella. The krait raised itself and struck several times viciously, but
    fortunately at the umbrella only. Wounded to the heart by this display of passion and
    anger, and with tears running down his cheeks, at least metaphorically speaking, he
    exhorted the snake to avoid anger, as it would the most deadly pestilence, explained the
    four noble truths, the three characteristics, the five precepts, the ten fetters of the
    soul; and expatiated on the doctrine of Karma and all the paraphernalia of Buddhism for at
    least ten minutes by the clock. When he found the snake was sufficiently impressed he
    nodded pleasantly and went off with a &quot;Good day, brother krait!&quot; </p>
    <p>Some men would take this anecdote as illustrating fearlessness; but the true spring is
    to be found in compassion. Allan was perfectly serious when he preached to the snake,
    though he was possibly a better man of science than a good many of the stuck-up young
    idiots who nowadays lay claim to the title. I have here distinguished between fearlessness
    and compassion; but in their highest form they are surely identical; even pseudo-Christ
    hit the mark when he observed, &quot;Prefect love casteth out fear.&quot;</p>
    <p>They managed to give me some sort of a shakedown, and I slept very pleasantly at the
    monastery. The next morning I went off to breakfast on board to say goodbye to the
    captain, who had shown me great kindness, and afterwards took my luggage and went to Dr.
    Moung Tjha Nu, the resident medical officer, who welcomed me heartily and offered me
    hospitality during my stay in Akyab.</p>
    <p>He was Allan's chief dayaka; and very kindly and wisely did he provide for him. I
    walked back with Allan to the temple and commenced discussion all sorts of things, but
    continuous conversation was quite impossible, for people of all sorts trooped in
    incessantly to pay their respects to the European bhikkhu. They prostrated themselves at
    his feet and clung to them with reverence and affection. They brought him all sorts of
    presents. He was more like Pasha Bailey Ben than any other character in history.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>They brought him onions strung on ropes,<br>
          And cold boiled beef, and telescopes,</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>at any rate gifts equally varied and not much more useful. The doctor looked in in the
    afternoon and took me back with him to dinner. Allan was inclined to suffer with his old
    asthma, as it is the Buddhist custom (<em>non sine causa</em>) to go out of doors at six
    every morning, and it is very cold till some time after dawn. I wish sanctity was not so
    incompatible with sanity and sanitation!</p>
    <p>The next day after breakfast Allan cam to the doctor's house to avoid worshippers, but
    a few of them found him out after all and produced</p>
    <p>{271}</p>
    <p>buttered eggs, newspapers, marmalade, brazil nuts, bicarbonate of potash and works on
    Buddhism from their ample robes. We were able, however, to talk of Buddhism and our plans
    for extending it to Europe, most of the day. The next four days were occupied in the same
    way.<hr>
