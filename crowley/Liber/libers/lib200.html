        <li>Let him greet the Sun at dawn, facing East, giving
        the sign of his grade. And let him say in a loud voice:<br>
        Hail unto Thee who art Ra in Thy rising, even unto Thee
        who art Ra in Thy strength, who travellest over the
        Heavens in Thy bark at the Uprising of the Sun.<br>
        Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor
        abideth at the helm.<br>
        Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Night!</li>
        <li>Also at Noon, let him greet the Sun, facing South,
        giving the sign of his grade. And let him say in a loud
        voice:<br>
        Hail unto Thee who art Ahathoor in Thy triumphing, even
        unto Thee who art Ahathoor in Thy beauty, who travellest
        over the heavens in thy bark at the Mid-course of the
        Sun.<br>
        Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor
        abideth at the helm.<br>
        Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Morning!</li>
        <li>Also, at Sunset, let him greet the Sun, facing
        West, giving the sign of his grade. And let him say in a
        loud voice:<br>
        Hail unto Thee who art Tum in Thy setting, even unto Thee
        who art Tum in Thy joy, who travellest over the Heavens
        in Thy bark at the Down-going of the Sun.<br>
        Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor
        abideth at the helm.<br>
        Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Day!</li>
        <li>Lastly, at Midnight, let him greet the Sun, facing
        North, giving the sign of his grade, and let him say in a
        loud voice:<br>
        Hail unto thee who art Khephra in Thy hiding, even unto
        Thee who art Khephra in Thy silence, who travellest over
        the heavens in Thy bark at the Midnight Hour of the Sun.<br>
        Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor
        abideth at the helm.<br>
        Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Evening.</li>
        <li>And after each of these invocations thou shalt give
        the sign of silence, and afterward thou shalt perform the
        adoration that is taught thee by thy Superior. And then
        do thou compose Thyself to holy meditation.</li>
        <li>Also it is better if in these adorations thou
        assume the God-form of Whom thou adorest, as if thou
        didst unite with Him in the adoration of That which is
        beyond Him.</l1>
        <li>Thus shalt thou ever be mindful of the Great Work
        which thou hast undertaken to perform, and thus shalt
        thou be strengthened to pursue it unto the attainment of
        the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and
        Perfect Happiness.</li></ol>
