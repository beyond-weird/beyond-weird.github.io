        Let the Neophyte by his understanding and ingenium devise
        a symbol to represent the Universe. <br>
        Let his Zelator approve thereof. <br>
        Let the Neophyte engrave the same upon the plate with his
        own hand and weapon. <br>
        Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to
        formform, and kept wrapped in silk of emerald green. </p>

        <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
        <p>Let the Zelator take a piece of pure steel, and beat
        it, grind it, sharpen it, and polish it, according to the
        art of the swordsmith. <br>
        Let him further take a piece of oak wood, and carve a
        hilt. The length shall be eight inches. <br>
        Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Word
        to represent the Universe. <br>
        Let his Practicus approve thereof. <br>
        Let the Zelator engrave the same upon his dagger with his
        own hand and instruments. <br>
        Let him further gild the wood of his hilt. <br>
        Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to
        formform, and kept wrapped in silk of golden yellow. </p>
        <h3 align="center"><a name="3">The Cup.</a></h3>
        <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
        <p>Let the Practicus take a piece of Silver and fashion
        therefrom a cup. The height shall be 8 inches, and the
        diameter 3 inches. <br>
        Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Number
        to represent the Universe. <br>
        Let his Philosophus approve thereof. <br>
        Let the Practicus engrave the same upon his cup with his
        own hand and instrument. <br>
        Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to
        formform, and kept wrapped in silk of azure blue. </p>
        <h3 align="center"><a name="4">The Baculum.</a></h3>
        <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
        <p>Let the Philosophus take a rod of copper, of length
        eight inches and diameter half an inch. <br>
        Let him fashion about the top a triple flame of gold. <br>
        Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Deed
        to represent the Universe. <br>
        Let his Dominus Liminis approve thereof. <br>
        Let the Philosophus formform the same in such a way that
        the Baculum may be partaker therein. <br>
        Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to
        formform, and kept wrapped in silk of fiery scarlet. </p>
        <h3 align="center"><a name="5">The Lamp.</a></h3>
        <h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
        <p>Let the Dominus Liminis take pure lead, tin, and
        quicksilver, with platinum, and, if need be, glass. <br>
        Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Magick
        Lamp that shall burn without wick or oil, being fed by
        the Aethyr. <br>
        This shall he accomplish secretly and apart, without
        asking the advice or approval of his Adeptus Minor. <br>
        Let the Dominus Liminis keep it when consecrated in the
        secret chamber of Art. <br>
        This then is that which is written: &quot;Bring furnished
        with complete armour and armed, he is similar to the
        goddess.&quot; <br>
        And again, &quot;I am armed, I am armed.&quot;</p>
