<h2 align="center" class="heading">Of Eden and the Sacred Oak:<br>
and of the Greater and Lesser Hospitality of the O.T.O.</h2>
<p align="center"><i>an Epistle of Baphomet to His Excellency James Thomas 
Windram,<br>
Very Holy, Very Illuminated, Very Illustrious, Initiate of the Sanctuary of the 
Gnosis,<br>
his Viceroy in the Union of South Africa.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</i></p>
<p>It has seemed fitting to Us to explain in a familiar form and simple the 
general principles of the government of the Profess-Houses of our Holy Order, so 
that the Abbot and Abbess of every such house shall understand by what paths to 
pursue the great aims which inspire Us to the service of our Brethren.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. Subject to the general discipline of the Order every Abbot is to be 
absolute master of the house of which he is in charge. Most of what follows is 
therefore suggestion only.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. The first principle of the growth of the Order as of all living 
things is modulation or variation; uniformity is to be detested as a symbol of 
death. Therefore each Profess-House is expected to develop a special character 
of its own, subject to certain broad principles rooted in human nature: and each 
Profess-House should be the artistic expression of the creative genius and true 
character of its Abbot. Some will therefore lean to the type of a club, others 
again to that of the college or university, while yet others will be set 
definitely apart for the purposes of orphanages, schools or hospitals. But let 
each Abbot seek with utmost diligence his Will, and express the same in the 
particular rules which he may make for the order of his house.</p>
<p>Types of houses which are found unnecessary or inconvenient will tend to 
disappear: those which are found generally suitable will tend to multiply.</p>
<p>It is therefore to be understood that the authorities of the Order charged 
with the discipline of the Profess-Houses will not interfere with the Will of 
the Abbot, unless he himself should set up opposition to his own Will as 
expressed in his obligations solemnly taken to the Order by removing its 
landmarks or impinging its grand principles. The disruption in his own Nature 
caused thereby must cause inevitably the ruin of his house and authority will in 
such a case avert the threatened disaster before its effects become manifest.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. Concerning Eden and the Oak it is not necessary that I should write 
openly to you. Only in those houses whose Abbot hold the Seventh Degree will 
this question arise. And it is here sufficient to say that the ideal condition 
will be that a Profess-House should enshrine four or more dedicated ministrants 
to the O.T.O. in the special sense of those letters which is known to higher 
Initiates, and such should be regarded with the most particular deference and 
reverence, while at the same time their lofty voew of service forbids them to 
share directly or indirectly in the government of the house. This ordinance is 
precise, and infringement will involve the removal of the Abbot. He will hold no 
intimate communication of any sort with the aforesaid ministrants, except in 
accordance with the terms of his vow as Sovereign Grand Inspector General.</p>
<p>The symbol of the Profess-House is therefore a great Oak from which flow 
streams of water to every quarter fertilising indeed the ground about the hill 
and fortifying with moisture the roots of the oak itself, but not eddying about 
it and sapping its foundations.</p>
<p>And in the spread of this Eden shall many men rejoice, taking shelter beneath 
overspreading branches, and refreshing their weary limbs in the fresh waters of 
the fount celestial pure.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the symbol may be that of a well in the desert, sheltered by 
four great palms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Familiarty and vulgarity are not to be tolerated in any 
Profess-House of the Order. Dignity and etiquette are to be strictly observed. 
Every member of the Order is to remember constantly that he is a King living 
among Kings, nay, a God in the company of Gods; and jollity iteself is to be 
recognized as a ritual of cosmic importance, as it is said &quot;The stars also sang 
together.&quot; The key of all conduct, generally speaking, is to make every common 
thing noble, every small thing great. In saluting a brother, therefore, think 
that this is the conference of two mighty monarchs on a matter affecting the 
destiny of empires. Laugh who will that this is the make-belief of children; it 
is yet the foundation of good manners. Sneer that it is pandering to human 
vanity; vanity is the father of self-confidence; and that is the father of 
power. Those fools that fall like Malvolio, let them be medicined by the rough 
kiss of earth, and if need be by the honest laughter of their fellows, for this 
is not far from the essence of the Comedy of Pan. But no man is to be despised; 
for he is a hero, having taken upon himself the burdern of flesh for the 
fulfillment of his Will. You know well that which is spoke, &quot;Seek Beauty! In 
Beauty is eternal Truth revealed!&quot; The artist is he who can discover Beauty in 
all things, for nothing is common or unclean; and by unvarying determination to 
discover beauty man comes to the heaven of the artist. By beauty, moreover, We 
mean not any conventional type of sensuous beauty: it lies in the dwarfts of 
Velasquez and the monsters of Rabelais as in the women of Titian and the heroes 
of Homer; nor shall one brother do otherwise than lament if he be so limited in 
vision that he cannot see beauty in that which enchants another.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. There is no rule with regard to the degree of luxury to be observed 
in any Profess-House. Travelling brethren are to accommodate themselves gladly 
to the plank-bed of one Abbot as to the eiderdown of his neighbour: either may 
be a paradise of love or sleep, as the Will of him that lieth thereon may 
conceive: for it is our Art to discover ecstasy in all things that may exist. 
Yet this is cardinal to the door of every Profess-House of our Order, that our 
great and secret Art is developed through the joys of labour. &quot;Work and be our 
bed in working!&quot; as though your toil was the basis of the ecstacy of the 
Marriage of the Gods! Every Profess-House is therefore in some sort a 
work-house, and a certain simplicity and austerity should thereform inform even 
the utmost luxury. &quot;Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be 
not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety 
rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let 
there be subtlety therein! But exceed! exceed!&quot;</p>
<p>The rules of Hygeine are therefore to be observed. A wise man will train for 
a dinner as he would for a race. To enjoy half-warmed Tibetan mutton, the 
noblest dish we know, it is necessary to starve for six weeks upon a glacier; 
and the man who has attained Pratyhara can obtain more pleasure from the 
movements of one muscle of his foot than a Western millionaire from his first 
season in New York City. The luxuries of the rich are not for all and there is 
but passing pleasure in them. It is the Art of Our Order to kill the belief that 
happiness of even pleasure lives in rare things or inaccessible, for this is but 
a folly as that of the child that cries for the moon. The Abbot of every 
Profess-House is therefore expected to be an Epicurus, a master of pleasure, an 
instructor in delight; and he is to know how to obtain all joy, and to be able 
to teach others to obtain it, by means that are within the reach of all men, 
excite no envy, and beget no selfishness. Asceticism is not encouraged, save in 
its old Greek sense of supreme excellence of physical condition; all so-called 
'denial of self' is Restriction, which is 'The word of Sin.' It is not 
‘self-denial’ for a man to refuse pleasures that hurt his health; for he chooses 
this course in order to obtain the greater pleasure of well-being. Confusion of 
thought on this subject is so common that We have no shame in explaining the 
true view thus fully.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>. When a guest arrives, at a Profess-House, the first evening should 
be set apart to making him thrice welcome, and it should be as far as possible 
the Will of all to acquiesce in the Will of the guest. From the following 
morning he becomes, as the vulgar phrase it, 'one of the family,' and he settles 
down to the routine of the house. Members of the Seventh and Higher Degrees are 
naturally received with very special honour.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong>. In the theory of the Order, the guest’s right to enter a 
Profess-House for the appointed period of three days, when the Lodge of the 
guest is in the same province as the Profess-House, or one month, when it is in 
a different province, is paramount, and overrides the rightr of the Abbot to 
close his door. But it is a main principle of the Order that power and 
authority, while theoretically absolute, are only to be exercised for the good 
of all concerned; and any brother abusing the great privilege of hospitality by 
failure to observe tact, courtesy and deference to the convenience and wishes of 
the Abbot whom he proposes to visit will become amenable to the discipline of 
the Order. It is evident that those who do not so abuse hospitality will find 
themselves welcome everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>.Abbots of those Profess-Houses which approach the domestic type act 
agreeably to Our will by receiving at least one person every night who is not a 
member of the Order, should such an one apply, and offering him freely food and 
shelter. If he be in need of assitance of any kind, it should be gladly given; 
as for example should he wish to find work, help should be afforded if it be 
possible to do so without injury to the interests of the members of the Order. 
this should not be regarded as charity, but as a tribute to the heroism of one 
who has incarnated in a world whose view is veiled from the unitiated by the 
hoodwink called 'Suffering.'</p>
<p><strong>9</strong>. All residents in the Profess-Houses of the Order are formally bound 
to perform the four daily Salutations to the Sun as prescribed in Liber CC (<i>Equinox</i> 
Vol I, No. vi, p.29). The exception is, when actually engaged in a ceremony 
approved by the Order, such as initiation, invocation, or meditation.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>. The use of artificial light, except for ceremonial purposes, is to 
be discouraged in the Profess-Houses of the Order; for the Sun is the master of 
the cycle of life. The exception is when serious intellectual labour is being 
performed. It is hoped that by this regulation the blessing of normal eyesight 
may be restored to humanity within a few generations.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong>. All residents in the Profess-Houses of the Order are expcets to 
co-operate in the service of the house to some extent, according to their 
capacity and bent. The Abbot is to be excepted from this rule, and he will 
appoint each task to the person best fitted to perform it. He will give to this 
work all the tact which he is possessed; but the others will on their side 
exhibit cheerful obedience as a point of honour, regarding it as a privilege to 
do his bidding, even though it seem unreasonable or unfair. Such conduct has its 
rewards in the general recognition accorded to it, and those who take advantage 
of the willingness of others find their loss not only in good report, but in the 
general deterioration of character which accompanies sloth.</p>
<p>The authority of the Abbot is paramount; and he may use such discipline as he 
may deem right to do.</p>
<p>But in most cases, when any person refuses to perform an appointed task, it 
is sufficient if the Abbot enjoin upon all others to emulate the example. If one 
wheel jar, let the whole machine stop until it becomes free. In practice this 
method has been found to work with great perfection. After two or three 
incidents of this kind, the trouble does not recur; should it do so, let the 
Abbot consider well if he be not seriously in fault of fairness or 
consideration.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong>. Members of the Order who make use of any Profess-House are 
expected to offer to pay for their entertainment at a rate one hundred per cent 
higher than that which is current for similar entertainments in the district. 
But the Abbot will not exact or expect such payment, but neither bestow upon his 
guests a present. The conflict is to be decided by consideration of the relative 
means of the traveller and the Profess-House. Thus let substantial justice be 
done by way of a contention in generosity, instead of social meanness.</p>
<p>Payment is never accepted for any stranger received for one night only under 
clause 8, but should such a person desire to join the Order, he may be initiated 
in the Lodge adjunct to the Profess-House according to the Laws of the Order, 
and then become entitled to all its privileges.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong>. The Profess-Houses of the Order are not to be distinguished in any 
way from the other houses of the neighbourhood, except those which are dedicated 
to special purposes, which will or will not be made known to strangers as the 
Viceroy of the Province may decide.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong>. Every Profess-House should develop strongly its own specific 
tradition, and the individuality of that tradition, by the initiation of customs 
peculiar to itself. The model may be a madhouse or a university, a nunnery or a 
brothel: this matters nothing; intrinsic strength, and power of adaptability to 
environment will survice and grown. But intensity of tradition, and peculiarity 
of custom, will tend to limit the growth and prevent it from attaining unwieldy 
proportions. Communes, rather than cities, will develop about each parent house. 
Yet the interest presented to the Order in general by the individuality of each 
house will stimulate Brethren to visit and ensure the constant interchange of 
ideas. Further, the peculiarity of custom will beget esprit de corps and such 
generous rivalry as now prevails between the Universities of Oxford and 
Cambridge, owing to the application of the principles above set forth.</p>
<p><strong>15</strong>. It is impossible to declare in an epistle what should properly 
form the subject of a great treatise; and it has therefore seemed good to Us 
merely to jot casual thoughts such as might prove of interest not so much to 
yourself alone as to those who wishing further information with regard to the 
peculiarities of our great and holy Order, may inquire of you concerning our 
rules.</p>
<p>Now there is no law beyond Do what thou wilt: and the object of rules is 
therefore only to assure to all men the best conditions for the execution of 
their Wills.</p>
<p align="center"><i>Love is the law, love under will.</i> </p>
<p align="center">The Glory of the All-Father be upon you, and Joy unutterable 
in the power of Him that we have known.</p>
<p align="center">With our paternal benediction</p>
