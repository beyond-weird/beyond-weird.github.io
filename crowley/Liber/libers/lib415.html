THE BOOK OF THE HIGH MAGICK ART<br>
that was worked by Frater O.S.V. 6degree = 5square<br>
Frater L.T. 2degree = 9square.<br>
(Jan-Feb 1914 E.V.)</h2>
<p>This is Document C in the account of the progress of NEMO to TO META THERION.<br>
<br>
This is the preliminary account of this Operation of Magick Art.</p>




<p>SOL IN LIBRA, An. IX &lt;&lt;1913&gt;&gt; Fra. O.S.V. &lt;&lt;{Anon. NOTE:} Ol Sonuf Vaoresagi = 
&quot;I reign over ye&quot; in Enochian, Crowley's motto as 5=6&gt;&gt; accomplished the task 
laid upon him by the Great White Brotherhood by issuing No. X of Vol. I of The 
Equinox. Thereby he being brought to the end of his resources, he bethought 
himself to pray unto the Great Gods of Heaven that they would bestow favour upon 
him -- for, even as did Job, he cursed not God at all -- that he might make a 
new sacrifice unto the Magnum Opus.</p>




<p>Now there appeared Fra. Lampada Tradam&lt;&lt;Victor Neuburg&gt;&gt;, having passed through 
the Ordeal of a Neophyte, to undertake the task of a Zelator, as by his Oath 
bound. Also for months 18 had Fra. O.S.V. been initiated by Fra. M.&lt;&lt;Theodore 
Reuss&gt;&gt; into the Greater Mysteries, and been by him induced into the Throne of 
the Order of the Temple.</p>




<p>Moreover, it is fitting to reconstitute this Order&lt;&lt;O.T.O.&gt;&gt; in its splendour, 
for at the entry of Sol into Aries, An X is the 600th anniversary of the 
Martyrdom of J.B.M.&lt;&lt;Jacobus Burgundius Molensis&gt;&gt; Also, a casual invocation of 
Pan by these Brethren had produced a great marvel.</p>




<p>All these things therefore tending thereto, let us take up the Work with piety 
and zeal, and in holy charity and great chastity of body and soul. Amen.</p>




<p>Thus therefore to the Glory of the Ineffable One of the Dove and of the Serpent, 
did these two Brethren begin their Working -- First. From 4:55 to 5:35 did I 
confess myself, even I, Frater O.S.V. 6degree = 5square receiving the Sacrament 
from a certain priest A.B.&lt;&lt;Art-Bachelor Walter Duranty&gt;&gt; and being thereby much 
comforted did I set myself to the painting of the prime pantacle of this book. </p>




<p>Therein busied, came inspiration unto me from the Most High, and this is the 
consideration: that though Pan be the Master of this Work, yet is the Work 
naught without Wisdom divine, and that Hermes is rightly the god of this 
particular Operation of Magick Art. Therefore, say I, let Hermes first be 
invoked, and that by the Rite, and by this incantation which I made with my 
friend the Art-Bachelor W.D.</p>




<p>Jungitur en vati vates; rex inclyte rabdon Hermes tu venias, verba nefanda 
ferens. &lt;&lt;Aprox: Jointly, the bard in the bard, O famous king of the wand, 
Hermes, mayest thou come bearing unspeakable words&gt;&gt;.</p>




<h3>The First Working</h3>




<p>[Wednesday, Dec. 31, 1913 e.v.]</p>




<p>At 11:40 therefore did I duly open the Temple, invoking also Thoth by the 
Egyptian formulae. And upon the stroke of midnight did the first words and acts 
of the Accendat strike on the Akasa. Then immediately did Mercury manifest in 
his first form, as it is written in Liber Ararita I, 8: &quot;Thou hast appeared to 
me as a young boy mischievous and lovely, with thy winged globe and its serpents 
set upon a staff.&quot; Astrally the Temple was full of thousands of flashing Caducei 
of gold and yellow, the serpents alive, and moving, Hermes bearing them. But so 
young and so mischievous was he that the sacrifice &lt;&lt;A sexual act.&gt;&gt;was 
impossible. This also we learnt, that at the Accendat the Ceremony is to be 
forgotten altogether, and to be resumed with equal suddenness at the first word 
of the mantra or versicle. And the excellence of this control is the agent 
evoking.</p>




<p>Then closed the Temple at 1:40 a.m. die Joviis thinking to renew the Rite in the 
evening, in the hope of obtaining Hermes in his next phase.</p>




<p>And Blessing and Worship to the Holy One, the Lord of the Serpent and the Dove. 
Amen.</p>




<h3>The Second Working</h3>




<p>This next invocation of Mercury was done with a new-made Image of the god in the 
East, a terminal Phallic figure in yellow wax, very beautiful, made that day by 
Fra. O.S.V. he also used these invocations &quot;At the limits of the Night&quot; and this 
&quot;O light in light&quot;, before the &quot;Majesty of Godhead&quot;. The Temple was opened at 
11:20 p.m. on the first day of the vulgar year. The Versicle began at 11:40 and 
ended at 11:55 circa. Immediately Fra. L.T. completely lost control; although a 
man of some education, degraded himself and dispersed the holy invoked Prana by 
defacing this volume with the meaningless scrawls opposite {WEH NOTE: Not 
available}, declaring them to be the inspiration of Thoth which were unworthy 
even of his ape. In this way a great part of the virtue of the Rite was lost. 
Some results were however obtained, and these were recorded in the esoteric 
account of this Working. The Temple was closed at about 2 o'clock of the 
fore-noon of Friday.</p>




<hr>
<h3>The Esoteric Record [of the Second Working]</h3>




<p>The god Hermes having been invoked, according to the Secret Rites, as elsewhere 
recorded, Frater L.T. proceeded to answer the demands, as follows:</p>




<p>Q: [O.S.V.]: Are we working right?<br>
A: [L.T.]: No.<br>
Q: What's wrong?<br>
A: The time, and, to a less extent, the place.<br>
Q: What is the right time?<br>
A: Three hours before dawn.<br>
Q: Does this apply to Mercury alone or to all the gods?<br>
A: To Mercury alone.<br>
Q: Are we to invoke Mercury again?<br>
A: Yes.<br>
Q: Tomorrow?<br>
A: No.<br>
Q: When, then?<br>
A: On the day of the full moon.<br>
Q: What god shall we invoke tomorrow?<br>
A: Thoth.<br>
Q: But Thoth is Mercury.<br>
A: You will get another aspect.<br>
Q: Shall we not use the same Versicle?<br>
A: It does not matter.<br>
Q: Shall I make statues of all the gods?<br>
A: No.<br>
Q: Shall I make tablets of all the gods?<br>
A: Yes.<br>
Q: Plain tablets, with the Versicles?<br>
A: No.<br>
Q: What tablets?<br>
A: Tablets with the names only.<br>
Q: In what order shall we invoke the gods?<br>
A: The proper order is -- Venus, Mercury, Juppiter, Luna, Sol.<br>
Q: Will he help in Geomancy?<br>
A: Yes.<br>
Q: And also in the conduct of affairs?<br>
A: In some not in all.<br>
Q: In business?<br>
A: In some business.<br>
Q: What?<br>
A: Books, money, love.<br>
Q: How can we invoke Mercury better?<br>
A: Use a golden pentagram, placing the same in a prominent position; drink 
yellow wine and eat fish before the Ceremony. Let the clock be removed.<br>
Q: Can you suggest any improvements in the Ceremonies, especially that of 
Juppiter?<br>
A: Scarlet and silver should be worn, and the crown O.S.V. L.T. is to wear the 
scarlet robe, violets are to be strewn and trodden with bare feet.<br>
Q: Give a distinct proof of your presence, appreciable by the intelligence of 
O.S.V.<br>
A: LET THE WAND OR ONE BECOME NINE, THIS IS THE SIGN OF PRIAPUS, BUT AFTERWARDS 
NOTHING.<br>
O.S.V.: I understand and agree the proof.<br>
L.T.: Shall I let Him take full possession now?<br>
O.S.V.: Yes.<br>
L.T.: I am going..........Yes. What do you want to know now? There are other 
things I can tell, or else ask me questions.<br>
O.S.V.: Tell.<br>
L.T.: You will receive good news in respect of money on the eleventh of January 
in the forenoon. Fra. L.T. will be concerned with it: it will be quite 
unexpected. Money will be given by someone to whom L.T. introduced O.S.V. A 
change in O.S.V.'s affairs in February.<br>
O.S.V.: (I am going to ask a very important question: concentrate hard.) 
N.C.G.M.H.D. (This question enquies as to when the speaker shall attain the 
grade of Magus.)<br>
L.T.: L.P. L is 50; and P. is 6.<br>
O.S.V.: 56 what?<br>
L.T.: I don't know....Wait....Hours? I am not quite sure, but it is connected 
with time.<br>
L.T.: The Ceremonies should be done every other night.</p>




<p>The Fratre then changed functions.</p>




<p>O.S.V.: The god has appeared to me in his character as a messenger, but as a 
robust adult, rather than a slim youth. He has the winged helmet and sandals, 
and bears a Caduceus of gold. (Frater L.T. confirms this description in every 
respect.)</p>




<p>O.S.V.: Hear the words which I bear through the ambient air. The Father of All 
hath girt Himself with a many-coloured robe; the Father of All hath spilt his 
seed on galaxy and globe. The formation of Nebulae is like the bursting of the 
seed pods of flowers. (These are not his words; but it is his meaning. I can't 
get his words at all.) What we call light he calls wind. Our highest spiritual 
experiences are what he calls light. That is why one gets the phenomenon of the 
Opalescent Universe, so to call it, in the Sacrament of the Ninth Degree.) (It 
is most important.... Never mind about that.) All this is the key to the meaning 
of the Latin invocation in the Vision of the Universal Mercury which I have 
never understood. (Memo; obtain a copy and confirm this) We shall shortly be 
given someone who will be of great help to us in our working.</p>




<p>L.T. now wished to ask questions.<br>
L.T.: When will the reconciliation of which I am thinking take place?<br>
O.S.V.: There is no real enmity, it is a mere tiff or misunderstanding.<br>
L.T.: When will the pressure of which I am thinking be relieved?<br>
O.S.V.: The answer to both these questions is Death, but I don't know in what 
sense.<br>
L.T.: Will the most important prediction of December be fulfilled?<br>
O.S.V.: Better than you think.<br>
L.T.: When?<br>
O.S.V.: It is imminent.<br>
L.T.: Conventionally?<br>
O.S.V.: Like the Sword of Damocles, it impends always, but may never fall. The 
answer, however, that I get, is three months.<br>
L.T.: Satisfactory?<br>
O.S.V.: I haven't got that.... I want to lie here, and see Mercury. It seems 
that Hermes is my particular deity at present. The golden sparks of which the 
Universe is composed, are shot with silver lightnings. In his next aspect he 
should reveal to us a great deal of the inner meaning of this particular Rite.</p>




<p>In the beginning was the Word, the Logos, who is Mercury; and is therefore to be 
identified with Christ. Both are messengers; their birth-mysteries are similar; 
the pranks of their childhood are similar. In the Vision of the Universal 
Mercury, Hermes is seen descending upon the sea, which refers to Mary. The 
Crucifixion represents the Caduceus; the two thieves, the two serpents; the 
cliff in the Vision of the Universal Mercury is Golgotha; Maria is simply Maia 
with the solar R in her womb. The controversy about Christ between the Synoptics 
and John was really a contention between the priests of Bacchus, Sol, and Osiris, 
also, perhaps, of Adonis and Attis, on the one hand, and those of Hermes on the 
other, at that period when initiates all over the world found it necessary, 
owing to the growth of the Roman Empire and the opening up of means of 
communication, to replace conflicting Polytheisms by a synthetic Faith. (This is 
absolutely new to me, this conception of Christ as Mercury.) Some difficulty 
about the [....]&lt;&lt;this sentence is now quite unintelligible&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>To continue the identification, compare Christ's descent into hell with the 
function of Hermes as guide of the Dead. Also Hermes leading up Eurydice, and 
Christ raising up Jairus' daughter. Christ is said to have risen on the third 
day, because it takes three days for the Planet Mercury to become visible after 
separating from the orb of the Sun. (It may be noted here that Mercury and Venus 
are the planets between us and the Sun, as if the Mother and the Son were 
mediators between us and the Father.)</p>




<p>Note Christ as the Healer, and also his own expression: &quot;The Son of Man cometh 
as a thief in the night.&quot;; and also this scripture: (Matthew xxiv, 24-7) &quot;For as 
the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West, so shall 
the coming of the Son of Man be.&quot;</p>




<p>Note also Christ's relations with the money-changers, his frequent parables, and 
the fact that his first disciple was a publican.</p>




<p>Note also Mercury as the deliverer of Prometheus.</p>




<p>One half of the fish symbol is also common to Christ and Mercury; fish are 
sacred to Mercury, (owing presumably to their quality of movement and 
cold-bloodedness.) Many of Christ's disciples were fishermen and he was always 
doing miracles in connection with fish.</p>




<p>Note also Christ as the mediator: &quot;No man cometh unto the Father but by me&quot;, and 
Mercury as Chokmah &quot;through whom alone we can approach Kether.&quot;</p>




<p>The Caduceus contains a complete symbol of the Gnosis; the winged sun or phallus 
represents the joy of life on all planes from the lowest to the highest. The 
serpents, besides being active and passive, Horus and Osiris, and all their 
other well known attributions, are those qualities of Eagle and Lion 
respectively, of which we know but do not speak. It is the symbol which unites 
the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, the symbol of the Magical operation which 
accomplishes this. The Caduceus is life itself, and of universal application. It 
is the universal solvent. It is quite easy to turn quicksilver into gold on the 
physical plane, and this will soon be done. New life will flow through the world 
in consequence. The god now lays his Caduceus upon my lips for silence; bidding 
me only remember that on the following night he is to come in another form.</p>




<p>The Temple was then closed. &lt;&lt;Promises to pay -- have quite replaced Gold.&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>Written out from 12:45 -- 2.30 p.m. 2.1.14.</p>




<h3>The Third Working</h3>




<p>[Friday, Jan. 2, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>The Temple was opened at about midnight (the clock had been purposely removed); 
at 12.27 a.m. die Saturni, the Quia Patris was ended. During the Versicle Fra. 
O.S.V. approached the state of ecstatic possession, seeing the Triple Cross of 
the Grand Hierophants, and then Hermes Himself, comprehending also that the 
t.... t.... b.... were the twin serpents that writhe upon his wand. But, 
mastering the tendency, the Versicle was quietly concluded.</p>




<p>A great deal of information and counsel was thus obtained, the full account of 
which is in the esoteric record.</p>




<p>The Temple was closed at 2.15 a.m.</p>




<p>In the morning the suggestion of O.S.V. that L.T. should arise, move and appear 
to transcribe the record led to two fine fights, a sign of the excess of magical 
force developed. During the previous day the Art-Bachelor W.D. came with what 
may prove to be good news of two matters, both of a Juppiterian nature. Also 
came a letter promising a valuable introduction.</p>




<hr>
<h3>The Esoteric Record [of the Third Working]</h3>




<p>Die Saturni: 1.58 a.m. Hermes as Force</p>




<p>L.T.: He is essentially phallic, but he has a book in his hand, the book II 
which has 106 pp. On the last page, as a colophon, is a four-pointed star, very 
luminous, and this is to be identified with the Eve of Shiva, and the book 
pertains to the grade of 7degree = 4square. The sub-title of the book is BIA, 
which is said to mean 'force'.</p>




<p>Every drop of semen which Hermes sheds is a world. The technical term for this 
semen is KRATOS. Those worlds are held in chains, but invisibly. People upon the 
worlds are like maggots upon an apple -- all forms of life bred by the worlds 
are in the nature of parasites. Pure worlds are flaming globes, each a conscious 
being. Number of worlds ejected, 7,482,135.</p>




<p>The name of this Phallus is Thoth, Hermes or Ma. Ma is the god who seduced the 
Phallus away from the Yoni; hence the physical Universe. All worlds are excreta; 
they represent wasted semen. Therefore all is blasphemy. This explains why man 
made god in his own image.</p>




<p>The feminine side of Ma is Pan, which explains why Pan is a devil. The only way 
to be really born is by annihilation -- to be born into Chaos, where Pan is the 
Saviour.</p>




<p>I may say no more because the process is secret.</p>




<p>With regard to Genesis; when Adam died, Heva became masculine, in order to 
escape the temptations of the serpent; but she failed. Her failure cut the 
serpent in two; hence the Caduceus: because if there were only one serpent, 
Hermes could not be the messenger of the gods. It is the quality of this serpent 
business that gives Him power to travel. This again is blasphemy; but lawful, 
because the law of the Jews is founded upon it.<br>
It is the fixed Mercury, of which the physical form of the god is made. This 
fixed Mercury is the result of the mind.</p>




<p>Semen itself is Mercury, the river of life flowing throughout the generations. 
That is fluid Mercury. What is (from the point of view of life) waste, is 
knowledge. Hence the opposition between knowledge and life. One is homo- and the 
other hetero-sexuality. Those are reconciled in Mercury, who is wisdom.</p>




<p>O.S.V.: I am making a silent prayer to the god, and thanksgiving. You can get 
magic force from either women or men; but to use the former is more dangerous to 
the career of the magician, and there is the danger of impregnation, which, 
however, can be guarded against in the obvious way.</p>




<p>In order to get this god more perfectly, a cock should be slain in his honour, 
and the blood drunk, as a sacrament. The throat of the cock should be cut over 
the great image that is upon the altar; the image should be placed in a vessel 
so as to catch the blood.</p>




<p>He should be invoked on 8 consecutive nights, beginning with Wednesday. He says 
we should feed in greater abundance: he will protect us. There is a gate to 
knock down between us and mastery of the Universe; and Frater L.T. has a fault, 
which is introspection. The point is that he is a man of thought, rather than of 
action. O.S.V. has also faults; his chief fault is contradiction. Whenever he 
gets into a state of hopelessness he may renew his strength by this Rite; and 
this will be good for always.&lt;&lt;It is remarkable that this actually occurred in 
May 1915 and July 1916 E.V. O.S.V. had forgotten the divine injunction. But the 
sudden change from &quot;dryness&quot; to &quot;herbility&quot; was extremely well marked. O.M.&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>The nature of this god is to go blindly ahead. The semen that he sheds is Kether, 
and not his own. He is only responsible for ejecting it, and he cares nothing 
what may come to it. He despises intensely all these correspondences, 
identifications, and the like. He despises intelligence; for he is the supreme 
wisdom; so fully in accord with destiny, that interpretation is beneath him. If 
we need pure magical force, he is to be invoked. He says that tomorrow night we 
are to ask questions by Geomancy, without doing any rite. We are to invoke 
Juppiter on Monday. Had it not been that we first invoked him, we could not 
invoke Juppiter successfully. We shall probably have to invoke Juppiter for 4 
nights running, reaching a climax on Thursday. We shall get not so much 
information as aid from Juppiter. It is very important to have Banquets.</p>




<p>L.T.: Will he help to this end?<br>
O.S.V.: he doesn't know and doesn't care.</p>




<p>He says &quot;Don't be such an ass as to think how you are going to do a thing: just 
do it&quot;. The man in the parable who counted the cost had the slave-spirit. He 
also says that in the rites of Luna and Venus, O.S.V. should have a woman; in 
that of Luna a menstruating woman. He refuses to tell me when I am to have this 
woman; He says it is a question of common sense. He says do it; don't ask me 
about it.</p>




<p>I am now lost in contemplation of him, in his great aspect of vehicle of the 
energy of the highest. He is that which fertilizes the luminiferous ether, the 
strain in it that produces what is called matter.</p>




<p>He is the creative energy of the artist, in particular, and one should invoke 
him unless one wants the &lt;&lt; An holy act before the world. (This was done, at the 
house of the Lay-Sister J.C. The Art-Bachelor W.D. was the victim&gt;&gt; 
'drawing-room songs of Apollo'.</p>




<p>I see it all now; the virile force of Mars is far beneath him. All of the other 
gods are merely aspects of Juppiter formulated by Hermes. He is the first of the 
Aeons. He wants us not to invoke the other forms of Mercury. He says that we 
have more knowledge than we know what to do with. Julius Caesar did not know the 
Qabalah, but he did better than the pair of you in the matter of husbands and 
wives. He, moreover, subdued Gaul and Germany, and would not have been killed if 
he had not gone to a talking shop.</p>




<p>I am praying Him to fill us with magick force for this invocation of Juppiter.</p>




<p>He says it depends principally upon the banquets. This is the great preparation 
to make. And he says &quot;What fools to bother about the room, you don't think I am 
in the room, do you?&quot; He wants us to overcome shame generally, and says &quot;There 
is no shame about me, is there?&quot;</p>




<p>He suggests an obvious method which I blush to repeat.</p>




<p>The sense of humour of this god is very strong. He is not sentimental about his 
principal function; he regards the Universe as an excellent practical joke; yet 
he recognizes that Juppiter is serious, and the universe is serious, although he 
laughs at them for being serious. His sole business is to transmit the force 
from Juppiter, and he is concerned with nothing else. The message is life, but 
in Juppiter the life is latent; he says that we can do everything if we will 
only act as he does.</p>




<p>He again exhibits his contempt for the art of conversation, by making a 
suggestion, with which, owing to the lateness of the hour, we comply only in 
symbolic form.</p>




<p>2:15 a.m.</p>




<h3>The Fourth Working</h3>




<p>[Monday, Jan. 5, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>It now appears to O.S.V. that the suggestion made by Hermes of a further 
sacrifice was meant to be obeyed. The attempt to replace the real thing by its 
symbol led to (a) O.S.V. having a bad cold which confined him to his bed (b) the 
continued ill-temper of L.T. (c) the breaking up of the rendezvous proposed in 
the letter (d) the complete cessation of good news. However, this afternoon die 
Lunae did the Frater L.T. sacrifice to the glory of Hermes: and may He restore 
us to favour and help in the Work of Juppiter.{Anon NOTE: Crowley used a double 
&quot;pp&quot; in Jup(p)iter for homosexual workings} Whom therefore let us invoke by the 
secret Rite and this holy Versicle:</p>




<p>Haud secus ac puerum spumanti semini vates<br>
Lustrat, dum gaudens accipit alter aquas;<br>
Sparge, precor, servis hominum rex atque deorum<br>
Juppiter omnipotens, aurea dona tuis.</p>




<p>9:00<br>
This then was done duly, though with maimed Rites, owing to O.S.V.'s malady. Yet 
did he take the function of priest. The Brethren remained conversing from 10 
p.m. (when the Temple was closed) until about 1 a.m. die Martiis when L.T. 
beholding Juppiter saw this verse:</p>




<p>Via est hodie. Nomina sanctissimorum in felicitate habent viam.<br>
Deus dedit signum in via.</p>




<p>&lt;&lt;The way is today. The names of the most holy in felicity have the way.<br>
God gave a sign in the way.&gt;&gt;</p>




<h3>The Fifth Working</h3>




<p>[Tuesday, Jan. 6, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>The Temple was opened at about 9.30, the rite performed ut ordinatur, and the 
closing accomplished by 10.30.</p>




<p>Deus adest. Fatur: &quot;Sparge verba; opus fiat. Hodie est verbum in nomine Dei: 
cras est opus.&quot; Et postea &quot;O beati qui haec verba noscunt! Ergo sum Deus hodie; 
aurea dona cras vobis feram.&quot; &quot;Accipe Dei verba, atque vobis bene erit. Benignus 
sum in hominum mundo semper.&quot; Deinde: &quot;Phallum ejaculatum tibi feram in nomine 
patri(s).&quot; Verbum Tibi refert ad fratrem O.S.V. (Patris refert ad Fra. O.S.V.) 
In nomine.</p>




<p>&lt;&lt;God is present. He says: Sprinkle words; let the work be done. Today is the 
word in the name of God; tomorrow is the work. And afterwards, 'O blessed those 
who know these words. I am God today; tomorrow I will bring you the golden 
gifts.' Receive the words of God and it will be well with you. I am benevolent 
always in the world of men.' Then; I will bear to you an ejaculating phallus in 
the name of the Father. The word refers to Brother O.S.V., similarly to the 
father. In the Name.&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>p.s. This promise was very amply fulfilled.</p>




<h3>The Sixth Working</h3>




<p>[Wednesday, Jan. 7, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>The Temple opened about 9, the Rite performed orally by O.S.V. and the closing 
accomplished at 9.45.<br>
O.S.V. thinks that L.T. has failed in due banqueting.</p>




<h3>The Seventh Working</h3>




<p>[Thursday, Jan. 8, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>Hitherto, so far as we are aware, nothing great of the result of the operation 
of Juppiter is obtained. Yet to-night I feel more confidence than usual: I am in 
a highly nervous or electric state. My cold was better, and I went for a fairly 
long walk and dined out. Am tired, excited, feverish: I think a slight relapse. 
Juppiter bring's all to a good end.</p>




<p>The Temple opened about 10:00; the Rite being done ut ordinatur we behold a 
universe of the most brilliant purple with golden stars, and Juppiter seated on 
his throne surrounded by the 4 Beasts upon thick clouds borne upon a phalanx of 
eagles. In the Book LXV, Chap. V, we find the passage 9 or 10 -- the passage 
8-13. Subsequently there appeared a great Peacock, meaning (according to Fra. 
L.T.) change - Journeys - motion - excitement - Improvement - ? Some word 
unknown. (LHIKMOPILV.) The Peacock is now crowned, and regards himself in a 
mirror. This word is summarized in &quot;Breaking&quot; i.e. of all old conditions. Fra. 
L.T. connects this with the word of Equinox of Libra An. IX. The Temple was 
closed about 11:20.</p>




<p>Received several visitors; the Art-Bachelor W.D., the fair damosel J.C.&lt;&lt;Jane 
Cheron&gt;&gt; and the good knight my brother-in-arms Sir Lionel&lt;&lt;Lionel E. Kennedy&gt;&gt;. 
Sculptured a sacred Phallus till nigh 2:00. 4:15 a.m. die Venerii a wonderful 
and repeated dream. I wake up, at last able to get down the truth I have long 
seen. Aelfrida Tillyard the beloved disciple and one &quot;Clairbelle&quot; (Lady Waloskie) 
figure in it. &quot;Mental images leave no trace when destroyed&quot;. Conservation of 
matter and energy are not paralleled by thought. (I had kept on reducing symbols 
to the Lingam and the Yoni and thence destroying them, much to the expressed 
wonder and alarm of Ae.T.) Of course the L. and Y. are only convenient standards 
of reduction: the point is that illusions destroyed leave no trace or effect, 
but merely vanish. As this process becomes general in one's life, it really 
diminishes one's universe. The bourgeois is subconsciously aware that this must 
result, and is therefore right in his own way in refusing to destroy even one 
illusion, and in persecuting those who shatter them. Also there is only one 
right path; to either side leads not merely off, but to the abyss. I remember in 
my dream mimicking the bourgeois a-tiptoe marking time, trembling and blind. 
This idea was also presented in many other ways, intensely vivid, which now I 
forget. Moreover as I wake myself thoroughly by writing this note, the lens of 
my intellectual comprehension of the great truth seems to dim, and I find myself 
fearing in the morning I should find the words obscure. &quot;The destruction of 
mental images is the only possible annihilation&quot; is my dream-idea. &quot;(Destroyed) 
mental images leave no trace&quot; is close to, if not quite, the wording. My 
contrast with matter and energy (set forth above) was a waking rational comment. 
I remember catching up an old felt hat, and explaining to Ae.T., Saraswati, the 
beloved disciple, that it was only to be destroyed by first perceiving it as a 
disguise for the Yoni -- I think the dream ran thus. But much I fail to 
recapture. Let me sleep again, and may the Holy One give again (if it be his 
will) to his beloved in sleep!</p>




<p>9:30 The post has brought 3 things of the nature of Juppiter: a letter from my 
lawyers, a pot of opium, and a love-poem of a religious type (Chicago May) Some 
readers may boggle at the attribution, but they are dull.</p>




<h3>The Eighth Working</h3>




<p>[Sunday, Jan. 11, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>Sunday Jan. 11. I saw a most remarkable fulfilment of the prophecy of Hermes. 
Also 2 other excellent matters have come to fruition. Further, one of the 
Brethren of O.S.V. and L.T. has inherited money, which is a great indirect 
benefit to that cause we have at heart. We then invoked Hermes, and obtained a 
good result.</p>




<p>On Monday Fra. L.T. was indisposed.</p>




<p>On Tues. the Brethren performed 'The Mass of the Phoenix' in the house of a 
friend, P.D.F. An instruction was moreover given to the Fra. O.S.V., to which he 
will duly pay heed.</p>




<p>On Wednesday Fra. L.T. being again indisposed, O.S.V. decided to go on Thursday 
to the forest with him to seek health. This they did, and by the favour of the 
gods obtained it. Now therefore on Monday Jan. 19 according to the counsel and 
reproof of Hermes did they again address themselves to the invocation of 
Juppiter; and this is Die Lunae.</p>




<h3>The Esoteric Record [of the Eighth Working]</h3>




<p>Die Lunae. 12.15 a.m.</p>




<p>The God Hermes having been invoked O.S.V. beheld him, in his character of the 
messenger, young, bearing the Caduceus. He stands upon the Altar of the East, 
poised upon his right toe. He is made of fixed light, the colour thereof being 
pale gold.</p>




<p>Lampada Tradam lifted up his voice and said' &quot;What sayeth He?&quot;</p>




<p>O.S.V.: I am the messenger of the gods, and I send you wreaths.<br>
Famed among men shall become this thy scripture.</p>




<p>L.T.: Will it be successful in its object?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: Yea: verily and amen.</p>




<p>The whole method is right, but we shall improve in details. L.T.'s mental 
attitude should be more poetic.<br>
The Mass of the Phoenix on Tuesday depends entirely on the feeling of mental 
superiority thus induced.</p>




<p>L.T.: Is there any message for O.S.V. of a personal character?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: He will have news, perhaps even tomorrow morning; rather startling in 
character; to be included under the general heading of good.</p>




<p>L.T.: Will L.T. get news?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: News is coming to him.</p>




<p>L.T.: Good news?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: Soft news; like the body of a dove. From England.</p>




<p>L.T.: Are the gods pleased with the Ceremonies?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: Yea; they rejoice exceedingly. This Rite is to be the mainstay of the 
work. Anything can be obtained by this method. Suitable persons will present 
themselves for initiation into it. Women are not to be admitted, except in those 
rites where feminine gods are invoked. They must not be admitted to the 
invocations of male gods.</p>




<p>L.T.: What is the immediate task?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: The four-fold invocation of Juppiter should have been performed four 
times; this week, however, it has been interfered with by The Mass of the 
Phoenix. You will therefore employ it in experiments, invoking Priapus, Bacchus, 
Mars, unless you find suitable women. You must be very careful with Mars, if you 
invoke Him. If it is still necessary to invoke Juppiter, begin on Monday, four 
times a week, for four weeks. But why should it be necessary? Abramelin squares 
may be used as Versicles. This (i.e. quasi instrumentaum gaudii) was the use of 
the child in the Abramelin operation. Respectability is the greatest of all 
blinds. The general key in reading ancient documents of a magical nature, is to 
suspect the worst. O.S.V. seems to get his fame alright, and this will leave him 
very peaceful.</p>




<p>Any amount of news coming for both of us; but O.S.V. has more than L.T. The news 
is like parcels of dove's wings, of a delicate purple grey or black goose quill; 
there is also news from the West of England; from Glasgow, or its neighbourhood; 
and from America.</p>




<p>L.T.: Are any officers wanted?</p>




<p>O.S.V.: No. No one is to be initiated until after the public orgie.......</p>




<p>I am now seeing the purple and grey background as if the force were developing. 
Around those clouds flash forth violet rays in the indigo. In the centre of all 
is the golden Mercury. Now He comes forward, kissing me on the mouth, laying his 
Caduceus on my Phallus. And he lifted up his voice, saying: &quot;Unto all kingdoms 
shall thou utter the word&quot;. Now He puts his tongue into my mouth. It is not like 
the tongue of a man, but of a serpent or an ant-eater. He runs it all over my 
brain, making the skull luminous, transparent, phosphorescent. Moreover He spake 
winged words:</p>




<p>&quot;I will give thee the wisdom the serpent, but thou must cleanse thy brain. Purge 
thyself in the sun. It is the love of others that will purify thee most. This 
needest thou: the devotion absolute of men four, and women four. And all these 
four men will be deformed, and these four women will come from the four quarters 
of the earth -- the four continents whose names begin with A&quot;</p>

<p>I see the most wonderful range of mountains with orange clouds of sunrise 
flaming upon them. Yet the crest of the mountain curls over as it rolls onward, 
like the crest of a wave. With one foot on this crest stands Mercury again, 
around him soft flames of orange, and green, and purple. And these words spake 
he from golden mouth:</p>




<p>&quot;Thou art mine. Thou comest always unto me. Always in every grade am I thy 
guide; and even at this hour do I burn up thy dust. Moreover, thou shalt behold 
a certain earnest of thy work, and that right early.&quot;<br>
This Mercury is poised upon a winged wheel that uttereth lightnings. He droppeth 
ostrich plumes for rank, and twists of flax to signify that the fate of certain 
men will be in my hands.</p>




<p>I now see a purple planet in space, radiating light from a luminous ring, and 
also from its poles.<br>
With regard to Reincarnation, the heliocentric theory is right. As we conquer 
the conditions of a planet, we incarnate on the next planet inward until we 
return to the Father of All, when our experiences link together, become 
intelligible, and star speaks to star. Terra is the last planet where bodies are 
made of earth; in Venus they are fluid; on Mercury aerial; while in the Sun they 
are fashioned of pure fire. It is most important to develop the fluid body, to 
pack away all your powers in it. He insists on the importance of a pure body, 
instancing Frater T'agathon as an example of a failure to do this.</p>




<p>I now see the eight-fold star of Mercury suddenly blazing out, it is composed of 
four fleur-de-lys with rays like antlers, bulrushes in shape between them. The 
central core has the cypher of the Grand Master, but not the one you know. Upon 
the cross are the Dove, the Hawk, the Serpent, and the Lion. Also one other 
symbol, yet more secret.</p>




<p>Now I behold fiery swords of light. All this is upon a cosmic scale. All the 
distances are astronomical. When I say &quot;Sword&quot; I have a definite consciousness 
of a weapon many millions of miles in length. The field of my vision is as much 
enlarged as if I had been practising Batrachophrhenobookosmomachia for ten 
years.</p>




<p>Now follow numerous questions of O.S.V. to L.T.; indicated only by initials. The 
same question was asked repeatedly in different forms, but always answered in 
the same sense until the last question.</p>




<p>[L.T.]: I have never seen such a lot of beautiful skyscapes. There are pink 
clouds like flights of birds, actually in flight, now they are like flying 
serpents, their colours are mingled with purple and green. Anhalonium visions 
must be very similar to this.</p>




<p>It is all over now.</p>




<p>He didn't go on, because he had come to tell us things, for a particular 
purpose.</p>




<p>The Temple was then closed; Fra. Lampada Tradam was then clairvoyant, as he 
thinks, or obsessed, as O.S.V. thinks, and makes the following statement, which 
O.S.V. considers demonic, on the grounds that many of the statements are 
contrary to public morality.</p>




<p>L.T. begins by saying that this Rite is a huge force that we unloose. By the 
time that we have 20 people working at it, it will become very dangerous. 
International complications are to be feared.&lt;&lt;Note that the world-war broke out 
just 6 months later. O.S.V.&gt;&gt; This was the original form of worship. It is 
important not to initiate any persons under the age of 30, unless for some 
special reason. The obvious dangers of the Rite appall L.T. He says that those 
who adopt this Rite will either succeed completely or fail utterly. There is no 
middle path for it is impossible to escape the ring of divine Karma created.</p>




<p>In any series of Rites the roles of the celebrants should not be 
interchangeable. O.S.V. is to be priest only in invocations of feminine gods. 
The occult reason for this is that only the black gods are hermaphrodite. (!!)</p>




<p>The exception to this rule is in cases of divine possession.</p>




<p>The supreme Rite would be to bring about a climax in the death of the victim. By 
this Rite one would attain the summit of Magical Art. Even better would be to 
slay a girl, preferably a willing victim. After violating her, she should be cut 
into 9 pieces.{WEH NOTE: See below for Crowley's opinion that this portion of 
the record represents false or grossly defective material from some interfering 
evil.} These should not be eaten, but divided as follows: -- head, arms, legs, 
and quadrisected trunk. The names of the gods appropriate are to be written on 
the skin, the arms are then to be flayed, and burnt in honour of Pan or Vesta, 
the legs (treated in the same manner) should be offered to Priapus, Hermes, or 
Juno. The right shoulder is sacred to Jupiter{WEH NOTE: here spelled with one 
&quot;p&quot; in contradistinction to the general practice of the record}, the left 
buttock to Venus. The head should not be flayed, but burnt simply, and that in 
honour either of Juno or Minerva.<br>
The Rite should not be employed on ordinary occasions, but rarely, and then for 
great purposes; it should not be disclosed to any man.</p>




<p>In the opinion of O.S.V. and L.T. these instructions partake of the character of 
black, or at least grey, magic. The reader is requested to note that the Temple 
had been formally closed before they were obtained.</p>




<p>The following questions were then asked by O.S.V. and answered by L.T.</p>




<p>Q: What will be the result of Yardley's mission?</p>




<p>A: Successful on the whole, but not entirely.</p>




<p>Q: Shall I know soon?</p>




<p>A: Within 14 days; say 10 or 11.</p>




<p>(Hermes returns; and kisses L.T. on lips, navel and Phallus.)</p>




<p>Q: Will L. get K's dances on?</p>




<p>A: Yes.</p>




<p>Q: Big success?</p>




<p>A: Yes.</p>




<p>Q: How soon?</p>




<p>A: Within three months.</p>




<p>L.T. will be released within two months from everything: he will get into a new 
stratum of Karma. He is going away eastwards. In June he marries; but returns to 
the Great Work in September. -- (P.S. All quite wrong without a single 
exception.) </p>




<p>Its conditions are quite altered. L.T. having acquired a great fortune.</p>




<p>O.S.V. goes away on a long journey to the East, leaving L.T. in charge X. This 
results in serious trouble with regards to Krishnamurti.</p>




<p>Let O.S.V. not allow 493 to enter into Scorpio.</p>




<p>O.S.V.: What is 493?</p>




<p>L.T. Connected with water and with Cremers. It is she that stirs up strife.</p>




<p>O.S.V.: What is 493?</p>




<p>A: It is connected with O.S.V.'s dealings with Cremers. O.S.V. has told her too 
much.</p>




<p>Q: What is 493?</p>




<p>A: A book, of a Mercurial nature, stolen by Cremers. Don't let that get into 
Scorpio. (? Energized Enthusiasm which got into ) (The questioner in a fit of 
despair abandons the unequal contest.)</p>




<p>Cremers will either write to L.T. or communicate indirectly with him. (P.S. All 
this is entirely wrong.)</p>




<p>Hermes now gives a gold ring to L.T. for O.S.V. The bezel of this ring is a 
ruby, with a white fleur-de-lys on each side of it. The ring is gold.</p>




<p>Opposite the ruby are the initials S.T.R. This ring is the crown of the Phallus, 
the Yoni of Thoth, the collar of the Ape of Thoth.</p>




<p>Concerning the Rites, O.S.V. is always to be first to scry. L.T. is to write 
down in the scrying. L.T. is always to be the priest. These Rites are never to 
be done for more than six successive nights,&lt;&lt;NOte. Evidently the Rite of 
Mercury is exceptional; for it asks 8 nights, Wednesday to Wednesday. See above 
O.M.&gt;&gt; and four is a better number. The Rites should never begin earlier than 
nine o'clock at night, and should never last longer than three hours and a half.</p>




<p>These are the colours of certain gods: --<br>
Priapus -- Yellow and purple.<br>
Iacchus -- Scarlet and green.<br>
Venus-- Blue, white and gold.<br>
Minerva-- White and silver with a little dark blue.<br>
Pan-- Crimson.</p>




<p>The floor should be white, but, on festivals and special occasions, black and 
white, or red and white squares.<br>
Further instructions will be given from time to time.</p>




<p>Music may be employed in the Rite, but in a subordinate manner. It should be 
soft and stringed.<br>
Celebrants of the Rite should not be bare-headed, but should wear head-dresses 
of white, or such other colour as may be indicated.</p>




<p>After five weeks other directions will be given. Until then work as aforesaid.</p>




<p>I now see the figure drawn hereunder.{WEH NOTE: not available at this time} It 
is familiar to O.S.V. as the sign of a certain grade, and the name of it is 
S.T.R.</p>




<p>Hermes now touches L.T.'s lips with his Caduceus, and gives this last message to 
O.S.V. &quot;Beyond nothing is Everything.&quot; He then kisses L.T., and departs.</p>




<h3>The Ninth Working</h3>




<p>[Monday, Jan. 19, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>Die Sol 11.45 P.M.--12.30 A.M.</p>




<p>A most admirable working, the best we have done for Juppiter. During O.S.V.'s 
invocation of Amoun, his vibration of the Name Divine was echoed in second by a 
voice audible to the ear. Now then fair omens dexter prosper ye the work. During 
the Quia Patris Fra. L.T. at the Altar of the East being genuflected, beheld the 
colossal form of Juppiter our Father, manubis plenis. Yea, with gold were his 
hands full; praise unto our Father and our god! In the morning Fra. O.S.V. awoke 
early, having (as hath only occurred to him once before) dreamed a story which 
he remembered. He therefore spent the day from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. in writing down 
this story which he called 'The Stratagem'. May it bring fame and fortune.</p>




<h3>The Esoteric Record [of the Ninth Working]</h3>




<p>Die Sol. Jan. 19, 11.45</p>




<p>The Rites of Juppiter were duly performed on this and the next two days. With 
regard to the ceremony of Wednesday, I have to add to the esoteric record that 
Fra. O.S.V. was at one time a consecrated prostitute in the Temple of the sun at 
Agrigentum. This Temple had a 'long square' (2 X 1) outer court. In the upper 
square was a square Temple -- with facade and pillars. O.S.V., whose name was at 
that time Asteris (or something similar), used to sit on the steps and receive 
sacrifices. I think the name was Astarte, but am afraid of having been 
rational.&lt;&lt;Aseria is the exact name of the Great Mother Goddess in Tyre. I did 
not know this. I regard this as a story proof of the accuracy of the vision. 
O.M.&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>The great sacrifice of Spring was to cut open a bull, and lay a virgin in the 
hot carcass, there to be violated by the High Priest. She was finally choked in 
the bull's blood (in orgasmo). Within the Temple was a circular domed shrine 
about 40 feet across. The priestesses used to carry their offerings to the altar 
of Incense in the East, while the blood of the victims went to a big font in the 
West. &lt;&lt;The door of the shrine was in the North; in the South was a statue of a 
Sun-God of a Syrian type -- rather more like Bacchus than Apollo. In the centre 
was a light movable couch rather like one sees in pictures at Naples. It was 
used in the midnight ceremony to obtain oracles.&gt;&gt;</p>




<p>The secret of the Temple was the Midnight Sun. Globes of fire used to gather on 
the font, and from the other altar, and begin to revolve in the shrine.</p>




<p>They would coalesce and then become one, which stood single and unmoving all 
night, only fading with dawn. Astarte surprised the secret, and penetrated into 
the shrine at the midnight sacrifice and adoration of this globe. She was slain 
instantly by the priests, who passed their swords again and again through her 
body. This death was extreme pleasure. The body was thrown out upon the court at 
the foot of the Temple steps, and made tabu, so that it might be 'devoured by 
the Sun'.</p>




<p>She had incurred this incarnation as the result of various misdemeanors in 
Greece about an hundred years before. Her incarnations had always been at short 
intervals. It appears that in the beginning most people cannot bear frequent 
incarnations, and need long restorative periods of rest and peace. But superior 
spirits take a great oath, and get on faster. They suffer more in proportion. 
You can recognise them by sensitiveness, which is sometimes in the painful or 
morbid degree. This is the case when the Great Work has been forgotten for an 
incarnation, or a part of it; the idea is to impress the fact of the oath upon 
the sufferer.<br>
Astarte in her Grecian avatar had been a rather worldly priest. Her childhood 
was one of great misery. She had been taken by pirates and ill-treated-- she 
came from Leghorn or its neighbourhood. A ship-wreck left her on the coast of 
Sicily. People found her, and finding her an excellent prostitute (she was now 
14), put her in a brothel. She hated the life. At a spring festival she was 
lucky enough to attract a young priest who took her, put her through a year's 
purification, and added her to the Temple staff. But she only saw a dull 
routine, though applying herself to advancement in her profession by the skill 
of her embraces. However, by the age of 20 or there-abouts she 'got religion', 
and began to act con amore. From this time she was rather the terror of the 
Temple. She used to do strange things, excesses, record-breaking acts, and so 
on. In fact she was a little mad; had a touch of the Sun as it were. However, 
she got the name of being inspired now and then, and was used in some of the 
public ceremonies. She made a young priest fall madly in love with her on one 
such occasion, and they violated their vows by carnal copulation of an 
irreligious character. In this way she made him tell her the secret of the 
Temple; she then killed him the same night, so that he should never betray the 
fact that he had betrayed the Mysteries.</p>




<p>She was a slim, lean, nervous girl with a long face, a Roman nose, rather full 
lips, very strong from constant exercise, a habit of wriggling as if consumed by 
an inward itch, abundant and very wiry black hair which she sometimes dyed, very 
strong and very sharp and white regular teeth, deep violet eyes, very wide 
apart, and set obliquely like Chinese eyes. Her cheek-bones were high, and her 
expressions fierve. Her breasts were quite undeveloped, and her body body like a 
man's, or rather, like a boy's. Her vulva was lean and muscular, the nymphae 
hardly developed at all.</p>




<p>Astarte was her Temple name; her own was Felicia. Her parents were peasants, 
vine-dressers, in winter woodcutters. (This description is most strangely like 
Alostrael.)</p>




<h3>The Tenth Working</h3>




<p>[Tuesday, Jan. 20, 1914 e.v.]</p>




<p>Die Martiis 11.30 p.m. -- die Mercurii 12.15 a.m.</p>




<p>The Ceremony as usual. Fra. O.S.V. saw Juppiter in his form as Ammon-Ra, plumed 
and Phallic, standing in the East, during the verbal invocation of Amoun; this 
became much intensified during the Versicle. He lost all sense of the physical, 
and was only recalled to it by its climax. Subsequently he heard (and so did 
Fra. L.T.) clear and distinct 'astral' bells.</p>




<h3>The Eleventh Working</h3>




<p>[Wednesday, Jan. 21, 1914 E.V.]</p>




<p>During the day the Brethren were out of harmony, but conquered the feeling of 
animosity by Will. A full Banquet as ordained being consumed, the Brethren 
repaired to the Temple; Fra. O.S.V. opened the same at 11 p.m. die Mercurii. To 
the sight of O.S.V. (during the Versicle) Ammon-Ra appeared in the East, 
Juppiter Himself filling the Temple. This also appeared as a cone of white light 
whirling about the Image of the All - One that is upon the Altar of the 
Elements. After the Versicle Fra. L.T. obtained a message in Angelic to the 
effect that the gods wish to regain Their dominion upon earth, these Initiated 
Brethren being as Fiery Arrows shot by Them in Their war against the slave-gods. 
A Four-fold sacrifice was demanded; and that a sacrifice of cruelty. Therefore 
did (.../...) and ultimately (He-Pe - Pe-He). The Temple was closed 1.45 A.M. 
die Joviis, Fra. L.T. still (1.55) lying entranced. The God is now effective. 
And with a single sacrifice on his Night (early, to close before midnight) will 
that equilibration of the 4 and the 7 be accomplished. Die Joviis 2 a.m. Frater 
L.T. says 'tetelestai' (N.B. this is the formula of 7=4 thus making 4 either 
way, yet 7 in all. And on this third night forming the sacred Tau. During this 
Working Fra. L.T. again heard the astral bells.</p>




<p>Also concerning the sacrifices it was revealed in the night, during the sleep of 
exhaustion, to Fra. O.S.V. that the esence of the Operation is the freeing of 
the elemental spirit of an animal soul. This may be done by death or by complete 
exhaustion either through pleasure or through pain. In this death-like trance 
the spirit becomes free to wander, and is united to the invoked God. In the case 
of death this is permanent, and goes to increase the body of the God on the 
planet. We should, therefore, when we can, obtain a closed and inviolable 
precinct, and slay therein victims daily. In the meantime, let one of the 
Brethren at least be reduced always to exhaustion by wine, and by the infliction 
of wounds, and by the ceremony itself. And if he utter oracles, let them be not 
consciously given. And if the true God be duly invoked, they will be divine. And 
this is the oracle which Juppiter gave unto Fra. O.S.V. in the night, or early 
morning of his day.</p>




<p>During all this day Fra. L.T. is oveshadowed by Juppiter. The world about him 
appears a vision of the future. His eyes are dilated; he cannot read; his manner 
is as one stupefied or entranced.</p>




<h3>The Twelfth Working</h3>




<p>[Thursday, Jan. 22, 1914 E.V.]</p>




<p>The Banquet restored Fra. L.T. to a comparatively normal condition. At 9.55 p.m. 
die Joviis the Temple was opened as usual. The sacrifice was offered, Fra. 
O.S.V. perinde ac cadaver, and the Temple closed at 11 p.m. Fra. O.S.V. was 
completely exhausted. Thus endeth the First Series of the complete Working of 
Jupiter.</p>




<p>Friday a.m.</p>




<p>There is certainly some result of these invocations; for matters move strangely. 
Five people who arranged to come to see me in Paris all failed; and both 
business letters (urgent) and private letters remain unanswered. I assume that 
this is the 'fallow' period which follows the sowing of the seed. But Hermes 
produced instantly a direct result. I take it that Juppiter being a slow and 
steady God moves not so easily but with far more power. P.M. I mentioned this 
matter to Fra. L.T. as regards letters, his experience is precisely similar to 
my own.</p>




<h3>The Thirteenth Working</h3>




<p>[Monday, January 26, 1914 E.V.]</p>




<p>On Saturday the drought of result broke up suddenly; both letters and visitors 
appeared. All things that have occurred have been of the nature of Juppiter, but 
so far there has been no plentiful harvest, naught as it were but green shoots 
peeping through the earth.</p>




<p>The Temple opened at about 11.30 Quia Patris 12.30, closing 2 a.m. die Martiis. 
Fra. O.S.V. became inspired in a Terpsichorean manner after the Accendat and Tu 
qui es. Much good force was obtained, and two Jataka stories. During the day 
Fra. L.T. obtained a small Juppiterian result, Fra. O.S.V. kept an appointment 
which may conceivably lead to vast Juppiterian results.</p>




<h3>The Esoteric Record [of the Thirteenth Working]</h3>




<p>January 26, 1914. Began about 11.30, ended about 12.30.</p>




<p>After the Accendat, O.S.V. did an inspired dance of the seductive-fugitive 
order. After the Haud Secus the Brethren revelled in the Juppiterian atmosphere, 
and then in talking about this O.S.V. remembered he had been a priestess in what 
he thought was Greece of an orientalised type. L.T. recognized this as Crete. 
O.S.V. agreed.</p>




<p>L.T. saw a green figure constantly dancing around the altar.</p>




<p>The ceremony was of initiation; this dance was the temptation. Neophytes were 
accepted if laughingly indifferent, or if, on the other hand, they refused to be 
played with, and violated the woman no matter how she struggled. Half measures 
were punished by having their testicles removed by a special instrument on the 
principle of a candle-snuffer, but with a regular cup instead of a guard. After 
the operation the instrument was thrust upon the brazier, and the man was thrust 
into the earthquake fissure, where he perished miserably.<br>
When all the flesh was gone, and the bones had dropped to the bottom, the next 
initiation could take place.</p>




<p>This Temple had pillars, a black floor shining like glass, mirrors to render the 
chase difficult. There were three priests, the lion-mask, the bull-mask, and the 
eagle-mask.</p>




<p>The initiate himself was the Fourth Kerub. These mysteries are the same -- or 
very nearly the same -- as the Samothracian mysteries.</p>




<p>O.S.V. had 28 hand-maidens. She was dressed in silver tissues, representing the 
way in which the moon slips away from the sun, and then falls back into his 
embraces: that is the idea of the dance.</p>




<p>O.S.V.'s name was Aia, which is really Gaia.</p>




<p>Twelve virgins were sacrificed annually, one a month.</p>




<p>Released on menstruation, because they became inpure, and so could not live in 
the Temple.</p>




<p>This is the great idea of magicians in all time: --<br>
To obtain a Messiah by some adaptation of the sexual process.</p>




<p>In Assyria they tried incest; also in Egypt; the Egyptians tried brothers and 
sisters, the Assyrians mothers and sons. Phoenicians tried fathers and 
daughters; Greeks and Syrians mostly bestiality. This idea came from India. The 
Jews sought to do this by invocation methods &lt;&lt;also by paedicatis feminarum&gt;&gt;. 
The Mohammedans tried homosexuality; mediaeval philosophers tried to produce 
homunculi by making chemical experiments with semen.</p>




<p>But the root idea is that any form of procreation other than the normal is 
likely to produce results of a magical character.</p>




<p>Either the father of the child should be a symbol of the sun, or the mother a 
symbol of the moon.</p>




<p>SPRING CEREMONIES IN CRETE.</p>




<p>There was a labyinth there; they had the worship of Apis from Egypt. (See Frazer 
and others on bull-worship; Shiva etc.)</p>




<p>There was a sacred bull in this labryinth, quite white. At the spring festival 
they sacrificed twelve virgins to him.</p>




<p>Et crudelis amor tauri et supposita furto,<br>
Pasiphae --------------- Aeneid VI.</p>




<p>They wanted to get a Minotaur, an incarnation of the sun, a Messiah. They said 
they had one, but they hadn't.<br>
L.T. was named Mardocles. Fair, very handsome, squarish golden beard. A very 
noble edition of Rudolph Cyriax. Hair curled in Assyrian manner, wore Chiton.</p>




<p>O.S.V. killed him by dancing badly.</p>




<p>L.T. being initiated, O.S.V. and hand-maidens came out and danced. O.S.V. fell 
in love and spoiled her dancing (.)</p>




<p>L.T. knew what to do and couldn't remain indifferent, but couldn't be brutal. 
And so at the last moment L.T. spared O.S.V. and was thrust out of the Temple; 
but neither killed nor castrated. She was also expelled.</p>




<p>L.T. and O.S.V. went penniless and sad into a town.</p>




<p>O.S.V. did up L.T's sandals which had come undone.</p>




<p>L.T. despised O.S.V. for ruining his career; he had been a merchant, a very 
wealthy corn-merchant (with a very rich father), and he had given up everything 
for initiation. L.T. was a special favourite of the high priest, the high priest 
being a friend of his father.</p>




<p>L.T. was about 24 or 25, but much older than his years.</p>




<p>L.T. hated O.S.V. but was too chivalrous to leave her.</p>




<p>L.T. only cared for O.S.V. while she danced: he felt he had ruined O.S.V's 
career as well as his own.<br>
We sat down, two doors away from the cobbler's on a stone.</p>




<p>O.S.V. did up L.T's sandal strap. The cobbler offered to do it free; L.T. was so 
handsome. We were asked to the evening meal.</p>




<p>The cobbler had an ugly scolding wife looking like &quot;Billiken&quot; or the Duchess in 
&quot;Alice.&quot;</p>




<p>A tiny little back room with children, including a boy of twelve or so.</p>




<p>The cobbler wanted us to go on the staff. This was perhaps in Ephesus; a 
sea-side place, anyhow.</p>




<p>His proposal was the only hope to avoid being sold for slaves by the 
magistrates.</p>




<p>But we were too proud, and said we would be sold for slaves, and we were.</p>




<p>A man with a country house and a beautiful wife bought us.</p>




<p>his name like Demetrius, more like Demephorius.? Demephorus.</p>




<p>We were employed about the house.</p>




<p>It was part of the ordinary duty of a servant to amuse the family, by various 
copulations. Only beautiful slaves were chosen for this purpose.</p>




<p>O.S.V. died of pneumonia some few months after.</p>




<p>Mistress a really classic type. Syro-Phoenician beauty. Grecian nose; coal-black 
curls, beautiful anklets; bracelets etc. Swathed in purple nearly always. Thin 
mouth; smile like Gioconda, but with corners turned down. The man was a fool; 
easy going; rather like Bourcier.</p>




<p>All this was long before the Trojan war.</p>




<p>Very civilized; before the Greek civilization we know of. Or perhaps more 
Assyrian or Phoenician.<br>
Asia-minor the scene of this.</p>




<p>They used oared galleys.</p>




<p>&quot;I shall never forget the look you gave me in the slave market.&quot; (O.S.V.)</p>




<p>&quot;I am always unlucky for you, you know; you always have to sacrifice everything 
for my love. You don't want to in the least; that is because we both have hold 
of the wrong end of the stick. If only I could leave you, and you could love me. 
It would be lucky. But that has apparently never happened. Mutual indifference 
and mutual passion, and so on.</p>




<hr>
<p>We played instruments in Corinth as girls.<br>
? had white skin. L.T. Chryssipe had yellow hair. O.S.V.<br>
We made popular Lesbian songs all day ---</p>




<p>We went on for years, and years, and years. We were sixty, and terribly famous 
... Like Zena and Phyllis Dare. This devotion of ours became proverbial in 
Corinth; we had to keep it up, exactly like a vicar and his wife in public.</p>




<p>After forty-three and a half years it got awful: then we retired to our country 
estates; but we had the habit over there. We turned into old maids. We had 
really loved with the most intense and true passion for a year or so; and then 
kept it up for profit.</p>




<p>But we were not cynical about it; we really fancied ourselves as the ideal 
lovers of Corinth.</p>




<p>Incarnation about wolves forgotten. Diana of Ephesus. We went on a mission, a 
business mission, of a Temple nature. Not L.T. (thank god.) There were wolves, a 
plague of them.</p>




<h3>The Fourteenth Working</h3>




<p>The Temple was opened on the stroke of midnight, and closed at 1.7 a.m. dei 
Mercuri Fra. O.S.V. being completely exhausted. The Jovian pheonomena continue 
with steadiness, but not with such force as to enable to say that the success of 
the operation is assured. During the afternoon we went to the house of a lay 
sister,&lt;&lt;Jane Cheron&gt;&gt; and invoked the Lord Juppiter by incense of his sacred 
herb.&lt;&lt;Opium&gt;&gt; This rested us mentally and physically, but caused some illness 
of a slight and temporary order.</p>




<h3>The Fifteenth Working</h3>




<p>The Temple opened at 11.15 p.m. and closed at 12.10. But the versicle was 
prolonged and very quiet, probably owing to the experience of the afternoon. 
Hence the force was coherent, crescent in a flat curve, but very strong in its 
culmination. The atmosphere of the Temple is now extremely good, not only in the 
ceremonies, when it is mellow, rich, velvety, luminous (purple, gold, green are 
the chief colours) strong without violence, calm, opulent, etc, etc, but 
throughout the day. We are excluding loose women and the like.</p>




<p>The principal physical things are a green chameleon --- like dancer named 
Ahanael (762) and the usual elementals darting about. Ahannael is under Bethor.</p>




<h3>The Sixteenth Working</h3>




<p>The Temple opened at about 10.20 after the Haud secus (again of the soft steady 
watery tupe) the god demanded blood. O.S.V. cut a four-square on L.T's breast 
and offered thereof, L.T. then did a wonderful dance, O.S.V. in Shivasana, 
O.S.V. became inspired. The planetary spirits by the way are now plain to see, 
next week the God demands that the image shall be placed in a vesica, and a 
sparrow (or if not a pigeon) shall be slain therein before the Accendat, with 
these words: Nunc flavi Jovi spumantem sanguine saevo passerem... or such other 
words as may be suggested by the Art-Batchelor W. D., who has been sent by 
Juppiter from London on this account. The blood only of a sparrow is to remain 
in the vesica, and to be connected (after the Versicle) with the Magi by the 
sigil 4 on L.T's heart, right breast left breast and navel on the four nights. 
The body is to be burnt for the last 4 nights both flesh and blood are to be 
sacrificed. The Temple closed at midnight to Thursday midnight no other blood is 
to be taken but the banquets, not drink save only pure water.</p>




<p>It is to be noted that since the beginning of this Operation the Bank Rate has 
fallen to 3 per cent and Consols improved from 71 1/2 to 76 1/4, a gain to 
O.S.V. of over Pounds 1400.</p>




<p>On Saturday O.S.V. received a letter which should bring Pounds 500 within the 
next two months.</p>




<p>I should mention that the possession of O.S.V. on Thursday night was the most 
complete and material possession and has occurred to him most rarely.</p>




<p>The directions were obtained with difficulty, and his whole consciousness was 
wrapped up in the god, the only expression being these words</p>




<p>&quot;Sanguis et Semen.&quot;</p>




<h3>The Seventeenth Working</h3>




<p>The Temple was opened about 10.30 and closed at 12.50 a.m. 3.2.14 E.V.</p>




<p>O.S.V. dedicated the bird to Juppiter and set it free. During the Versicle 
O.S.V. lost consciousness. After the Quia Patris L.T. the 4 cut on his right 
breast, was to have acted as Virgo. A marvellous matter folled, but no further 
rite was accomplished. At 1 a.m. Fra. L.T. was still too exhausted to speak. 
O.S.V. doubts if he did well to avoid the apparent and obvious meaning of the 
instruction vouchsafed last Thursday night. This should be decided by the events 
of Tuesday -- Thursday. If unsatisfactory, the birds let loose 2 on Tuesday, on 
Wednesday, should all 4 be slain on the last night of this series.</p>




<h3>The Eighteenth Working</h3>




<p>The Banquet of Juppiter began at lunch. Then we bade Bro. Sir B. C. 
Hammond&lt;&lt;Benjamin Charles Hammond&gt;&gt; the Good Knight God - Speed. At the 
conclusion of the banquet the spirit of Mars waxed strong, and O.S.V. tare L.T. 
with bitter words, to which Fra. L.T., like a good brother as he is, replied 
with modesty, humility, courtesy, forbearance and brotherly love. (The averse 
Mercury also seized upon Fra. O.S.V. during the writing of this last sentence!) 
However the Bretheren embraced in the name of Juppiter, and opened the Temple at 
10.30. A lengthy ceremony followed, the usual rite being followed by ... vatem 
... virgo ... orally. The image of the Most High was thus richly adorned with 
due ornament. The Temple closed at 1.5 a.m. dei Mercurii, the forces being 
completely absorbed.</p>




<h3>The Nineteenth Working</h3>




<p>Fra. O.S.V. during the day had a feverish attack of something resembling 
influenza; but receiving the remedy of Juppiter from the hands of the Lay-Sister 
Cheron, was miraculously made whole, though the aftermath still slightly 
inconveniences him, he having taken the Remedy in Excess.</p>




<p>The Temple opened at 11.28 closed at 12.50 a.m. dei Jovis, the ceremony being 
most magnificent. (Query; this represents the West Wind as last night the East, 
and the firstnight of this series the North?) During the Versicle O.S.V. saw the 
Sarcophagus of Ankh-f-n-khonsu, a misty dawn of gold at the East of the Altar, 
erect. The ceremony raised Fra. O.S.V. from discomfort, sleepiness, and fever to 
the top of his form. L.T. gets a white elephant with the word LEX Labor est + 
(The phallus in its sense of the completed Work.) Also Baphomet spelt 
Beth-Pe-Mem Taw 1082 {WEH NOTE: as two &quot;words&quot; to use Mem-final} (Note. 1081 = 
Tiphareth, add 1 for the therein. No! O.M.) The atmosphere is marvellous calm 
and sweet, soft a the kisses of Zephyros - a perfect peace and joy.</p>




<p>During the day, by the way, Fra. O.S.V. got the idea that Fra. L.T. would make a 
perfect low comedian, and thus gain much gold.</p>




<h3>The Twentieth Working</h3>




<p>The Temple opened at 10.0 closed at 11 p.m. dei Jovis.</p>




<p>On Friday Fra. O.S.V. got a letter making a most valuable introduction; also 
full confirmation of the other matter. Praise Him!</p>




<p>Fra. O.S.V's malady now reasserted itself, however, with great force. He has 
much fever and bronchitis, and is obliged to take to his bed. To-day, of the 
Moon, he is still very ill, but yet determined to continue the Operation as well 
as he may, though with mained rites.</p>




<h3>The Esoteric Record</h3>




<p>Inspection of Cakkras.</p>




<p>O.S.V. ? 3-5 A.M. Feb. 8.</p>




<p>Muladhara. Blood-red, velvety, deep-bell shape. Around it the Kundalini coiled, 
but in constant spiral motion.<br>
Luminous triangle --- mirror-like-opens at base (very small.) I looked down 
through infinite stages of these triangles, at the bottom glitters a pearl-like 
(but self-luminous and most intense) phallus. Presently this goes, and up the 
tunnel march millions of men of every race, creed, caste and colour -- not a 
single woman.</p>




<p>Svadistthana. Very large flattish white lotus, greenish tips to edges, very pale 
and fair; It floats in pale blue.</p>




<p>Manipura. A chysantheum of rainbow petals, active-like folding and refolding, 
comprehending alternatively microcosm and the macrocosm.</p>




<p>Anahata. Mostly gold and pearls with rubies and sapphires, I think, but this 
fades in memory.</p>




<p>Visuddhi: Myriad radiating knives of pure golden light; in all directions.</p>




<h3>The Twenty-First Working</h3>




<p>The Temple was opened mentally by O.S.V. at about 9.10, and closed at 9.23. In 
spite of all the handicap, the ceremony went exceedingly well. An excellent 
atmosphere was obtained, and O.S.V's temperature went down .4 degrees C!!!!</p>




<h3>The Twenty-Second Working</h3>




<p>Fra. O.S.V. is now recovered, and is ungrateful enough to the doctor -- an 
excellent and clever practitioner to yet greater thanks to Juppiter. His 
temperature went down .3 C during the actual ceremony, which opened at 9.30 and 
closed at 10.15.</p>




<p>This was in some respects the best we have yet done. Fra. L.T. &quot;Got Juppiter&quot; in 
his pregnant phrase, and went on with the mechanism of the Accendat and the 
preparations for the performance of the Versicle before O.S.V. had finished his 
hexagram ritual (done after the verbal invocation of Amoun) but the Haud secus 
itself was brilliant and inspired, and the result overwhelming -- a glow of 
stupendous success.</p>




<h3>The Twenty-Third Working</h3>




<p>Fra O.S.V. worked very hard from 6.30 a.m. after a bad night, yet was well and 
strong in the ceremony which went magnificently. At the Quia Patris he saw his 
shadow plainly on the dim reddish wall in the East, although at the West there 
was but another such wall, and the firelight (in the North) was without 
effective radiance. The ceremony was more brilliant and ecstatic even than last 
night. Fra. L.T. is even more completely exhausted than before.</p>




<p>3.18 a.m. Message for A.G. &lt;&lt;Aimee Gouraud&gt;&gt;... &quot;Without pity, act. Guests dally 
on the couches of mother of pearl in the garden. Go to the Holy House of Hathor 
and offer the five jewels of the cow on her altar. Then go under the night-stars 
in the desert and invoke Nuit. &quot;Result establishment of Nuit cult. A previous 
divination had given (two days before) &quot;is not the Nile a beautiful water?&quot; the 
question being should I go to Tunis for A.G.? (Tunis being nearer the Pillars of 
Hercules and the Ocean of the West.) The Juppiteran events of a minor character 
are now so frequent that they are too many to record without tedium. Contrary 
events to not occur at all.</p>




<h3>The Twenty-Fourth Working</h3>




<p>Fra. O.S.V. had a sleepless night and had to work all day. Yet, opening the 
Temple at 6.15 and closing it at 7, this great operation was brought to a 
successful end.</p>




<p>The ceremony was calm and deep, the very aroma of earth in spring. After the 
Work Fra. L.T. performed divination by Thelema and obtained this versicle:</p>




<p>&quot;I am Thou, and the Pillar is established in the Void.&quot;</p>




<p>During the Haud secus, Fra. L.T. was taken by Juppiter to be his cup-bearer. 
Fra. O.S.V. beheld the Violet, formless and of Dhanic intensity.</p>




<p>P.S. Result. Fra O.S.V. obtained the gifts of Juppiter as he asked, and was 
further made like Juppiter in his aspect as Amoun. During the whole summer he 
had but to ask to obtain.</p>




<p>Fra. L.T. on the contrary became Juppiter the bestower, and many folk became his 
guests.</p>
