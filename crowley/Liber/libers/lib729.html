12.10 a.m.</p><p>
While with The Lady of Our Dreams I had a vision of Myself being a spreading 
candlestick with thirteen candles. Over each flame was the opening of a tube 
which could hold water as a fountain. These tubes met the flame in a throbbing 
vibration which became almost excruciating when suddenly the part of the 
candlestick above the stem or staff, broke off and became a crown. The crown 
floated in the air tilted at a slight angle and a circle which was a halo came 
down from heaven and dropped into the crown. In the center a wand came and then 
it all hovered above the candlestick with a veil round it. The veil in some ways 
appeared as rays of light. After I told this vision T[herion] talked a long 
while about the number 93; how adepts were tested when they brought messages; 
and how messages had been sent to him through the Scarlet Woman.</p><p>
I had another vision of myself being thirteen naked women lying in a row and all 
being caressed at one time. When I told this to T., in a somewhat indirect 
manner, he suggested that I see if I could get any messages through visions or 
otherwise.</p><p>
I began by asking for a vision containing a message. I first heard gurgling 
water and saw a dark farmhouse in among trees and green fields. The house and 
other things disappeared and a dark yoni appeared just where the house had 
stood. I then asked where will a message come from? Immediately soldiers with 
guns appeared lounging about the place and a king on a throne where the house 
had stood. I then asked again for a message and saw an egg in which were many 
many tiny convolutions of some flesh-like substance which would form something. 
The egg was placed in an oblong as in a picture. Around it were clouds, trees, 
mountains and water, called the `four elements'. A camel appeared in front of 
the whole picture. I next tried to find out who the king was. He looked more 
like Prof. Shotwell than any one else. That is, he was `simple, democratic' and 
very learned and fine. He was certainly not a king belonging to any kingdom 
limited by a country's borders, but was a king of men, or a king of the world. I 
asked his name and the word `Ham' appeared between the egg in the oblong and the 
soldiers around the king.&lt;&lt;i.e. King of Egypt?&gt;&gt;</p><p>
The king went out to one side and a wizard linked his arm in the king's as they 
disappeared. The wizard looked at me significantly as they left. It was a sort 
of look as if one would almost wink. He was an old man, with gray beard, dressed 
in a long black gown. He was infinitely wise. They seemed to go to a cave in the 
base of a low mountain on the shore of a large body of water. A spring of 
sparkling cool water bubbled up through a barrel near the mouth of the cave. I 
went into the cave and saw them doing something mysterious with a revolver. The 
wizard had the revolver. What they were going to do was a joke of some kind, but 
the wizard looked grim about it. At T.'s suggestion I went up to them and said, 
``I am Eve.'' This seemed to stop everything. They both disappeared with the 
cave. Very soon I saw the king sitting in a niche covered with a canopy, cut in 
the side of the mountain. In quite another place the wizard was sitting under a 
tree fanning himself. At T.'s suggestion I went up to him and asked him his 
name. I became very frightened and had the same sensation as when I spoke to him 
in the cave. It was a kind of shyness and awe. He only smiled at me and would 
not speak. It seemed that I did not know enough for him to speak with me. In 
order for him to say anything to me I should have to build a fire of sticks, 
which he showed me how to do. There was a baby in some way connected with the 
act of my building the fire which was like a ritual. Then a most beautiful lion 
was standing by the fire. The wizard was standing and still held one or two 
sticks in his hand. He smiled and said, ``Child.'' I then saw a most beautiful 
naked boy 5 or 6 years old dancing and playing in the woods in front of us. T. 
asked how he would look dressed and when I saw him in conventional clothes he 
looked very uncomfortable and repressed. He looked as if he should be dressed in 
skins such as tigers'. To one side near the place where I made the fire was a 
large turtle standing up as a penguin stands.</p><p>
The wizard was very happy and satisfied looking. He sat down and reached out his 
hand to me and had me sit down beside him. As we watched the boy he put his left 
arm around me tenderly and placed my head on the left side of his chest near the 
shoulder.</p><p>
He said, ``It's all in the egg.''</p><p>
The End.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday] January 20, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
3.00 a.m. (W.T.L.O.O.D.)</p><p>
I asked the wizard for a message. A large red `A' appeared and an eagle came 
through it and flew away through the woods and over some meadows close to the 
ground. The eagle disappeared and a red Indian was running like the wind. (Very 
beautiful as a picture.)</p><p>
4.00 p.m.</p><p>
T. and I entered the astral plane. I draped in a diaphanous virile yellow green, 
he in a brilliant red with gold braid. In one hand he had a sceptre and a ring 
on the other. We went through the ceiling and up about 900 feet in the air and 
looked up and saw an eye in the clouds. We went to the place of the eye and saw 
a platform-like building. There were many doors with signs of various sorts on 
them, such as the Swastika etc., etc. We went to a distant door at the end of 
the corridor on which there was no sign. A dwarf stood to the right and a girl 
to the left of the door. I asked the dwarf where the door led to. He did not 
answer but showed a column with a blazing top. I asked the woman and she said 
``Heaven.'' Interpreted, it meant where we wanted to go. I opened the door 
easily and saw a corridor in darkness. We passed through and saw light outside 
at the end door. A sheep was just inside the door. (Also sheep down on the 
ground below.) We went outside and looked down a few hundred feet upon a 
beautiful pastoral scene and some villages. We dropped down to this scene. A 
beautiful lady came. She was blonde and dressed in creamy white. I asked her her 
name and she answered ``Eve.'' This seemed wrong for her to say. I asked her 
where we were to go to. She said ``France.'' I asked about the message and after 
some time she lay upon the ground with her head toward us and waved her hand, 
which looked like the fins of a fish, toward a village. We all went there. On 
the way a man who looked like a Greek philosopher walked a little behind us as 
if he were in a shadow. He had a staff and was in Greek costume.</p><p>
When we came to the village which was called Pantruel, we saw a church in front 
of which was a square in which there was a cone-shaped fountain. The fountain 
was made of metal and water spurting from each petal of the cone. Later the 
fountain showed that it was also flaming. The dwarf was now with us and we asked 
him who was the fountain keeper. The fountain opened and the king (of last 
week's vision) came out with some papers in his hand. One of the papers was a 
topographical map of South America. The others were legal papers, deeds, etc., 
etc. I asked about the message and he kept looking at the papers, and finally 
told us to go to the wizard. We went down by the stream and across it into the 
woods where the wizard and the child were. They both looked a little lonely. I 
asked his name and he told me Amalantrah. I asked who I was and he said ``Part 
of the Tao.'' I asked for the message and he put me off in all sorts of ways 
with small visions. Once he said, ``Go,'' which I took to mean to go to some 
place. Later he said ``Egypt.'' He did not seem very friendly toward me and 
seemed worried at times.</p><p>
I asked how to spell (Bafometh) &lt;&lt;[Baphomet]&gt;&gt; and a man like the Gods of the 
Mountains answered my questions about this. Finally I was told B-a-f-o-m-e-t-h. 
I begged for more information about the message but got none. Many questions 
were asked about the letters of the spelling as to whether they were Hebrew 
etc., etc. They were Hebrew.</p><p>
I then said Good Bye, noting the boy's beautiful dark eyes, and we went away by 
a little path to the pool of the spring. We bathed in this and then sank through 
the bottom and came out directly over Manhattan. We came back into our bodies.</p><p>
Much later I asked for the king's name and was told Eosophon.</p><p>
Later I was told that the boy was named Augustus Fioncharo.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Saturday] February 2, 1918 e.v.</p><p>
</p><p>
2.30 a.m. W.E.</p><p>
I ask wizard if he has anything to say to us. He thunders ``NO''.</p><p>
Therion says that saying NO is saying something. All philosophies for aeons and 
aeons based on No. They are false. The most important of all scales is that with 
the index 6, his own number being 729. &lt;&lt;Note. 729 is the numeration of 
Amalantrah in Hebrew.&gt;&gt; This is natural vanity. Let us however consider this 
scale. It consists of 0, 1, 64, 729, 4096, 15626, 46656. The wizard says these 
numbers of perfection are much use in the Qabalah of the angels and Therion need 
not bother himself much about them.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Friday] January 25, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
W.T..L.O.O.D.</p><p>
The wizard showed me a large green god with many arms, sitting in a doorway. 
Name on doorway in strange letters was `Gate of Abdullah'. I entered this 
doorway. Inside was an oasis; a well with many Arabs about. The name of the 
place was Oseika in Marrakesh. A tall Moor, Athanan, talked to me. He was 
showing (as were)&lt;&lt;EXROUOM&gt;&gt; they all ( . . . ). His favorite animal was one I 
could not name. It came out of some water where it had been drinking. Was grey 
zebra-like (Unicorn). Athanan said his name added to 74.&lt;&lt;Or is this his 
grade?&gt;&gt;</p><p>
</p><p>
Q: ``What is my true number?''</p><p>
A: 103. &lt;&lt;Anan = 102: q.v. Very interesting.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
Her magical name in his language was Ahita &lt;&lt;417. Olive. Noah's Ark.&gt;&gt;.</p><p>
&lt;&lt;103 plus 1. Tzaddi the link. 417 plus 1 = 418. The 1 is of course the 
phallus.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
He was not a living man, but represented a white man named Haman. &lt;&lt;107, angel 
ruling Leo&gt;&gt; He would carry on certain work.</p><p>
666: ``How?''</p><p>
A: A Moor's hand with a ring, many stones of different colors, arranged like 
flowers in the form of a cross of equal arms. (666) will prosper in work and be 
very happy.</p><p>
Q: ``How would this come about?''</p><p>
A: Through a certain person. &lt;&lt;[P.S.]: O.I.V.V.I.O.&gt;&gt; A tall man|| with light 
moustache (European) on edge of picture had something to do with it.</p><p>
Q: ``When do we get definite action on the material plane?''</p><p>
A: ``Before next solstice.''</p><p>
Q: ``Does someone (666) have to take action or sit tight?''</p><p>
A: ``Both.'' This certain one must use his brains to plan things.</p><p>
Q: ``Tell me if B.C. (Annie Besant) will live long in her present body?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is a political campaign among existing occult societies with a view to 
unification under 666 a good plan?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Should T. approach X?'' (Bert Reece.)</p><p>
A: A white lotus appears. ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Should T. approach another person?'' (Ada Levenson.)</p><p>
A: ``No.''</p><p>
Q: ``Should he approach (Bjerregard)?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is there anyone else to approach?''</p><p>
A: Some woman. (Alma, mind thought.) She was stout, large breasts. 40; married, 
no children; dark chestnut hair; pretty skin; fairly good looking; possibly a 
singer or musician; smiling rich; moderately well-educated American: her name 
was Elsie Gray Parker.&lt;&lt;Could this be a shot at E.G.P. for Aegipan?&gt;&gt;</p><p>
Wizard says Woodstock adds to 84.</p><p>
Q: ``How should T. act to find Elsie G[ray] P[arker] ?''</p><p>
No answer. Wizard now looks like an enormous god, Sphinx head, stalwart, 
bearded-Assyrian god type. Abdometh is his god name.&lt;&lt;Abdometh = 463, the Middle 
Pillar and Almond Rod. Equals Servant of the Dragon or of Mithras (? A.C.) or of 
the Tables, i.e. of Thoth.&gt;&gt; He is sceptered with a kind of battle axe and a 
knob-kerry in the other hand. He stood against a great dark mountain behind 
which the sun was rising. The light and effect was one of the most beautiful 
pictures I ever saw.</p><p>
Q: ``Where is Elsie G[ray] P[arker] ?''</p><p>
A: ``In an hotel or private house on 5th Ave. or near.'' 666 knew some friend of 
hers.</p><p>
Q: ``Is she a friend of A[imee] G[ouraud] ?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``When may T. expect fulfilment of Liber Legis Cap. III, verse 31?''</p><p>
A: ``September.''</p><p>
Q: ``What year?''</p><p>
A: ``1918.'' This was doubtful.</p><p>
Q: ``What nationality is the man referred to in that verse?''</p><p>
A: ``Austrian.''</p><p>
Q: ``Where does he live now?''</p><p>
A: ``By a well of concrete: trees around it. In U.S.A.'' (Nebraska?)</p><p>
Q: ``What business is he in?''</p><p>
A: ``Man of leisure.''</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[ Saturday] February 2, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
W.T.L.O.O.D.</p><p>
In the Earth. Woodland appears. Hills etc. A man called Alamacha. T. invokes 
Fire of Earth. At end of invocation I saw Japanese looking face which rapidly 
changed to a dog-like face. Next saw bamboos. Black men with large knives. Then 
a wild boar. Water in the distance. Place like India.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday] February 3, [1918 e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Next day continued.</p><p>
After a talk on the Qabalah it occurred to T. to ask for a Moslem word to match 
the 93 series.</p><p>
A star of six points comes from a cloud. The star is attached to a projection of 
clay thrust like a phallus from the cloud. The star disappears: a round green 
wheel takes its place. All disappears. Arcteon ( . . . ). Two very old women 
going to door of wizard's room. A council room where he gives things to the 
Aeons. Like messages or instructions, or words of wisdom. The word (Abrahadaba). 
Ram appears in the room; also a shadow of a fish and a peculiar colored fowl 
(chicken-like with the fore part taken away) which represents the sign of the 
Zodiac, Aries. Ram now stands on the cloud.&lt;&lt;Teth-Lamed-He, ram = 44.&gt;&gt; A pair 
of open shears broken. A crowned Jesus looking up suffering.&lt;&lt;That is lamb = 
V.O.&gt;&gt; Wizard throws a vision of party of people. One transparent fat woman. Her 
body shows through her clothes. A butterfly with wings of pine cones in a bowl.</p><p>
The star reappears and becomes an eye. Then a cross on a key-ring. Then a key. 
Three Ethiopians in strong poses Malachas, Thelmachus, Argenon.</p><p>
Arcteon comes back.&lt;&lt;Amth = truth.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
``How many letters has Arcteon?''</p><p>
A: Star reappears, gold on a winged base.</p><p>
Both of us were very cross and almost stopped in a quarrel.</p><p>
Q: ``How many letters has Arcteon?''</p><p>
A: ``Seven.'' It turns out to add to 360. (A R K Teth I Ayin N = 360.)</p><p>
Q: ``Who is Arcteon?''</p><p>
A: Alameda. (I did not know this word.) His function is to preach the law.</p><p>
Q: ``Is he a living man?''</p><p>
Wizard laughs.</p><p>
Q: ``Is he born yet?''</p><p>
A: (A lot of symbols appear.) ``No.''</p><p>
T. asked if I could see him. A gorilla appears but is not he. There is a stable 
by which there is a chair for 360. 360 has a hoary black head, rather caveman 
like, unkempt. Jewish looking, but not a Jew. Not German.</p><p>
Wizard looks far away from me spiritually. On shelf (Pylon) where egg is a 
flaming lamp appears. Over the lamp is a peculiar light. In this light there is 
a peculiar large-headed, particularly large-eyed small bird. Also there is some 
strange kind of material like drapery in folds. It is somewhat like metal made 
into decorative objects like ornamented mirrors etc. etc. and finally like 
convolutions in the egg.</p><p>
I see the wizard walking through the desert on hot sands. He is not walking 
straight along. He is intense. Carrying on some work. I saw an oasis and the 
dog-like Japanese face, and the lower part of the stall in the stable. I ask the 
wizard if he had anything to say to us. He pays no attention to me and reaches 
the oasis. I leave him here.</p><p>
I see the king at the fountain at Pantruel. I ask his function. He does not 
answer because he is modest and simple. He is in ordinary clothes and has a red 
mark on right side under arm and along chest. I see the child and ask its name. 
He does not tell me. He turns into many children as I watch him. These children 
have a goat or a dog and play around. The old name of (Fionchella) does not fit 
child. He says ``Rex Pan.'' When I ask if he belongs to wizard or king. Pan has 
something to do with the name.</p><p>
I see the egg on the pylon. I ask who the egg belongs to. The wizard shows me a 
hen laying an egg and says ``Whose egg is this?'' I ask him what his opinion is 
of us. He respects T., but pays little attention to me. This part about little 
attention to me is false in me. I have to readjust myself back to a true 
attitude towards the wizard. He now shows me a mirror. I have on a travelling 
hat. T. in a robe in a hotel room. This means something about a home. We are to 
go to Egypt for the key. The key might be in center of egg when it is broken. It 
is a small golden key.</p><p>
Q: I ask the function of the Monkey Officer.</p><p>
A: ``To operate through the abstract law of Obsession.''</p><p>
Q: I ask if I am in the series of 156.</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``My number?''</p><p>
A: 3.</p><p>
Q: ``My name?''</p><p>
A: None.</p><p>
Q: ``My number?''</p><p>
A: 184. (We worked out number 184.)</p><p>
Q: ``Will the work of the 9th degree be better carried out by one than two?''</p><p>
A: ``Two.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is it better to work in a circle or vesica?''</p><p>
A: ``Circle.''</p><p>
Q: ``Have you any criticism of T.'s present method?''</p><p>
A: ``More strength and punch needed.''</p><p>
Q: ``Does T. fail more in solve or in coagula''</p><p>
A: ``Coagula.''</p><p>
Q: ``Can any improvements be suggested?''</p><p>
A: ``Be more stern and comprehensive.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is there any special dodge about the preparation of the tincture?''</p><p>
A: ``Must be clear drop by drop.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is talismanic theory approximately correct?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is the general formula of `The Paris Working' an ideally good one?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes, only not quite bold enough.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is the use of Mantras or hymns very advantageous?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is the method of drawing 10 from 400 by 80 a good one?''&lt;&lt;10 = seed, Yod. 
400 = a sack, 80 = Pe, a mouth.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
A: ``Yes, except the length of the levers.''</p><p>
Q: ``Does the eagle play an important part?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Has T. been making the substance of the talisman satisfactorily?''</p><p>
A: ``It is too weak or too thin.''</p><p>
Q: ``Should T. disclose the contents of the book AGAPE to the person in his Mind 
at present?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.'' I see vision of an elephant with howdah in which there is a man with 
black moustache black eyes, has mahout. It appears just back of the wizard who 
has for some time had three bodies around him. They stand so that one is to the 
right in front of him and the others to the left one in front of the other.</p><p>
Q: ``Is the trouble with the talisman one of technical skill or an original 
trouble?''</p><p>
A: ``Original.''</p><p>
Q: ``Can this be remedied?''</p><p>
A: ``Use proper leaven of life: begin as an early child.'' I see a vision of a 
child in an old fashioned crib being rocked.</p><p>
Q: ``Is T.'s theory of Levanah based on certain alchemical considerations 
approximately correct?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
February 9-11, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
5.20 p.m. [Monday, February] 11. W.T.L.O.O.D.</p><p>
I see all the usual ones at the wizard's woodland place. They all look sad or at 
least very quiet and concerned. I go up to the wizard and ask if he has anything 
to say. He sits down on some steps and motions me to sit at his feet. He spreads 
out his hands, palms downwards, and begins. ``Once upon a time there was a man 
and a girl.'' I recognize the story as about me, and instantly stop the picture, 
for I do not want personal things here. The ego must be crushed. (The truth is 
that I have been very unsettled and unhappy about T.'s way of interfering with 
me in my manners toward him. I have been trying to settle on the best plan to 
get along and have reached the place where I am trying to forget it all -- in 
other words suppress what I really feel is right.) I turn and tell the part of 
the story to T. about my ego appearing and he insists that I must suppress ego. 
Later, as we talk along, T. attacks me again for having caressed him in the 
night. I had done this in order to forget the differences of points of view that 
we seemed to have. His remarks here take my breath away for he seemed to be so 
far from understanding the whole underlying truth. I go back to the wizard 
saying to T. that I shall ask the wizard what to do. When I see the wizard he is 
convulsed with laughter, and says to me: ``You have burned your fingers again; 
you must let T. alone. The only way out for you is not to care.'' I see a 
distinct flash of dazzling light which shows me that this is the only way out. 
(I tell T. that it is alright that the wizard tells me that I must forget it 
all.)</p><p>
I go back to the wizard and he shows me a beautiful dog's head in relief against 
a snow peak on the mountain. Then a walrus lying on the ice. Now a beautiful 
Esquimaux with an ice-axe, and sled getting food. All of this is a sort of 
warning to me, or a continuation of what the wizard was telling me was the way 
out for me. The dog's head means dog-like fidelity (undesirable), 
self-abnegation; the walrus, stupid fat housewifely virtues; and the Esquimaux, 
food providing.</p><p>
T. asks: ``W.Y.B.A.U.T.M.?'' (Will Yorick be any use to me?)</p><p>
A: ``T.T.T.'' (In Greek Qabalah) -- ``Yes.'' I see an inverted G, perhaps Teth.</p><p>
T: ``What use?''</p><p>
A: The wizard has a boy in his arms and turns him so that I see his back. He is 
a farmer boy. There is a baby in the wizard's arms whom the w[izard] `teaches to 
spread the law'.</p><p>
T: ``S.I.G.M.W.F.?'' (Shall I get my work filmed?)</p><p>
A: I see a hole in the subway: a trap door, white fur animals like balls are 
moving about rapidly. (This means the struggle to break away the interferences.) 
``Yes, that is the way.''</p><p>
T: ``H.S.W.C.T.F.S.?'' (How soon will come the first success?)</p><p>
A: ``When the snow melts.''</p><p>
T: ``Physically?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes (doubtful): I mean spring.''</p><p>
T: ``Any special message today?''</p><p>
A: ``Keep to the task. The fight will be severe: E[ve] will pay a high price.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
7.10 p.m.</p><p>
T: ``In what house of heaven should I work most to secure publication of Equinox 
III?''</p><p>
A: ``Fifth.''</p><p>
T: ``In what sign of the zodiac?''</p><p>
A: ``Ram.''</p><p>
T: ``With what planet?''</p><p>
A: ``Jupiter.''</p><p>
T: ``I.W.C.S.i.B.F.T.E.O.S.A.XV?'' (In what country shall I be for the Equinox 
of Spring An XV?)</p><p>
A: I see the path up the mountain with goat&lt;&lt;Khem.&gt;&gt; then the ram. There is a 
hole in the side of the mountain. (Pyramid and entrance.) ``It is desirable'' 
(i.e. the country T. wishes to visit). I see a spur like a cock's (D&lt;&lt;P.S.: 
Trinacria?&gt;&gt;). Also a tiny wheel with 10 or 12 spokes. Really 12, and this 
picture (Crock of Osiris) (Eye of Horus) (N. the Whip-scourge of Osiris). 
``Yes.'' Now I see the N in a whip and a section of a boiled egg. I ask the 
number of the answer this.</p><p>
A: ``179.'' (Ligatio.) ``57?'' (Rim; consuming; wealth, an age, time; terrible; 
we; breaking down, destruction; built; fishes; altar; making secret.)</p><p>
T: To what country do these numbers refer and why?''</p><p>
A: ``Egypt.'' I see a trap with a little animal like a weasel coming out; behind 
this a prison door. Answer to ``Why?'' is ``Scented wind.'' (This is possibly 
256 = 179 + 77.) The 57 melts and reforms itself into 77 which is the right 
number. There is a bushel of corn poured out which proves this. (256 = eighth 
power of 2 = 2 + ? The house of God. &lt;&lt;Might be Egypt too.&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;77 is OZ a goad. 
102 is Tzaddi-Beth-Yod a wild goat.&gt;&gt;)</p><p>
T: ``D.D.T.P.A.G.P.I.T.W.I.T.N.F.?'' (Does Dorothy Troxel play any great part in 
the work in the near future?)</p><p>
A: The wizard raises his left hand and bright rays of light shoot like a curve 
over his head from the fingers. A bird and the rising sun I see in the desert 
(it is the same funny bird that I often see). ``Yes.''</p><p>
T: ``What part?''</p><p>
A: ``I see the wizard touch his left shoulder. There is here a peculiar 
box-shaped machine with 4 striated legs. It suggests Teth. Some Arabs carry out 
a litter on their shoulders. ``The best part, the blessed part.''</p><p>
T: ``H.F.B.A.P.I.T.W.?'' (Has Faith Baldwin any part in the work?)</p><p>
A: I see icicles and a jolly face in a winter's cap. ``No.''</p><p>
T: ``W.M.L.B.O.[A.]U.?'' (Will (Miss)&lt;&lt;( [Mrs] )&gt;&gt; L. be of any use?)</p><p>
A: I see a moon, a full moon and an obelisk. ``Yes.''</p><p>
T: ``S.I.A.H.A.I.S.W.?'' (Shall I ask her and if so what?)</p><p>
A: ``Yes.'' I see a latticed enclosure -- a tiny table for two as in some famous 
hotel, large diamond fastened to a metal animal like a monkey. The diamond is 
fastened to its tail. This monkey is in the wizard's hand. There is a long staff 
with a top shaped like some kind of shell, in the air. Also a mountain with a 
very sharp peak. A pretty blond woman in a beautiful blouse comes in to eat at 
the table. I can see her as a bride of some future date. I think of J.F. -- 
``The number is divisible by 7.''</p><p>
T: ``What number?''</p><p>
A: ``63.'' (Abaddon -- Hell of dregs.) ``The way is long: the road difficult.''</p><p>
T: ``W.R.H.?'' (Will Ricker help?)</p><p>
A: I see beautiful coleus leaves fluttering, making a figure like an inverted 
`F' modified. 6 (The sigil of Taphtartharath!!!) I see a robin's egg in a nest 
or hole in the ground. ``No.''</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Wednesday] February 12, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
With Mrs Elsa Linke. After dinner.</p><p>
I see the wizard standing up. The egg is there; the child is sitting under a 
tree with the roots showing where the rain has washed the dirt away. The lion, 
the turtle and the mountain path are all there. Also the remains of the charred 
fire sticks where I built the first fire with the wizard. I greet the wizard. 
Salam Aleikum. He lifts his left hand and drops pearls or jewels from his 
fingers. He says ``Amaranthus.''</p><p>
Q: ``What is the connection with Amaranthus?''</p><p>
A: I see a ship going South, loaded with Oriental things -- teak wood . . . I 
see a gold-fish washed upon the shore of the sea. Amaranthus seems to mean 
something holy -- Holy Light. I see something about a lotus.</p><p>
Q: ``Is T. going to do any great work at the altar we are going to set up in 
Egypt whence we are going to find that egg?''</p><p>
A: The wizard's function with me is to get the truth. He knows the truth for me 
and is a guide to me. He expects me to go to Egypt to get the egg. He expects T. 
to go.</p><p>
T.'s work is some great work.</p><p>
Q: ``What is the magical name of Mrs L?''</p><p>
A: ``(Barzedon).'' (Seven, secret, put away, hiding place, shining light, for 
rising sun. T[herion].) I see a great white cloud upon which there is a glow 
which turns into a ram's head. There is a frog on the ground. The w[izard] says, 
``From the toad much is to be learned.'' The toad is the symbol for Barzedon.</p><p>
Q: ``When Barzedon is in danger is she to visualise the toad?''</p><p>
A: ``No. It is a more general symbol.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is it expedient to start to find the egg and when should we start?''</p><p>
A: The egg is a work which must be done -- the great work. By doing the work we 
get to the key.</p><p>
Q: ``Is it the same vision as in the Virakam vision?''</p><p>
A: ``The work must go on and there must be an altar, created in Egypt -- 
starting in Egypt.'' I see the Arab, the one that was at the well some time ago. 
He will be at one of the corners of the altar. The king is there.</p><p>
Q: ``Who is the king?''</p><p>
A: I see O.I.V.V.I.O. T. is the High Priest.</p><p>
Q: ``Who is the High Priestess?''</p><p>
A: I see a tall rather beautiful woman, i.e. her face had a beautiful 
expression. She has dark hair.&lt;&lt;[P.S.]: Might well be 31-666-31.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
T. knows his work, his special work and this is only the means of doing it, like 
speaking of the cosmos, but the egg is the special work.</p><p>
Q: ``What special work has Barzedon to do?''</p><p>
A: I see the toad again. Her work is something like a mother's; shielding. There 
is always a golden light, giving a glow.</p><p>
Q: ``W.B.T.S.I.T.W.?'' (Will Barzedon then sit in the West?) (This means will 
she stay in U.S.?)</p><p>
A: I see growing grain and a fox among it. There are baskets of corn, an eagle, 
and an egg on the ground near the corn. The eagle watches the egg.</p><p>
Q: ``Who is the eagle?''</p><p>
A: I see the path and something forming out of indefinite material like in the 
egg of the first vision. The eagle is in the sky on the other side of the w. I 
see the crock again. 21.</p><p>
Q: ``When are we to go to Egypt?''</p><p>
A: I see two queer animals -- rats as big as horses drawing a chariot at a great 
pace. I see T. standing surrounded by four knights who are pressed close to his 
body. There is a wonderful expression on T.'s face. An expression of 
consecration to some great work.</p><p>
Q: ``W.J.T.O.B.T.R.T.T.S.[T.]J.?'' (Would June 21 be the right time to start the 
journey?)</p><p>
A: I see a horse's head. The w. holds out his hand forming a rabbit's head. 
There is an object in the w.'s -- 4 shells forming a square cross -- Something 
like scallop shells.</p><p>
Q: ``Would the w. be pleased to take B[arzedon] on the astral plane now?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.''</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Saturday] February 16, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
10 p.m. W.T.L.O.O.D.</p><p>
Operation of IXdegree to improve communications with Amalantrah -- Blessed be 
he.</p><p>
1.30 [a.m.]</p><p>
After some talk, Qabalah, etc., I state my general position. Ahita having some 
doubts as to her communications. Amalantrah says we must have faith -- in common 
-- especially Ahita, or her messages will be blurred.</p><p>
Q: ``Did we act rightly in the matter of Barzedon?''</p><p>
A: ``Very unwisely.''</p><p>
Q: ``How?''</p><p>
A: ``Crude.''</p><p>
Q: ``What course shall we now follow in the matter?''</p><p>
A: ``Do not have any visions with her. Be definite and frank. Do not be in 
haste.''</p><p>
Q: ``What does he think of the letter I wrote to Dorothy Troxel?''</p><p>
A: ``Very good.''</p><p>
Q: ``Why am I reluctant about Bert Reece and the search for E[lsie] G[ray] 
P[arker] ? Am I very wrong in not pushing this?''</p><p>
A: I see a purple bier with silver casket on it, 4 steps into a large hall. This 
is connected with E.G.P. The bier is oval -- filligree -- and very long. There 
is also a tree covered with ice. There is a filligree bird's nest with wings -- 
a poor boy on a stairway running away. He has a pale white head -- nondescript. 
There is a dead bay horse. A low ceilinged room in vista and a table set with 
food over which there is a Japanese umbrella. A beautiful woman is eating at the 
table. A[malantrah] says that T. will meet E.G.P. unawares. He need not seek 
her.</p><p>
Q: ``Is her name E.G.P.?''</p><p>
A: ``No.''</p><p>
Q: ``Is there something definite to be said to us tonight?''</p><p>
A: ``How to live. Fear God, and gather the straws as a bird builds a nest.''</p><p>
Q: ``Do you approve of the letter to S.A. today?''</p><p>
A: There is a bright light in A.'s face as he looks up. (Repeated several 
times.) ``Yes.''</p><p>
Q: ``Does A. know about Dee and Kelly Working?''</p><p>
A: ``Something vague about `Work on or with James or Sir James'. There is a 
passing vision here of a large railway terminus of some large railway system.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Sunday [February 17, 1918 e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
11.00 [a.m.]</p><p>
Note. Ahitha means a natural form of Achitha -- old spelling of Chiva which in 
full is 666.</p><p>
8 p.m.</p><p>
I am asking A[malantrah] questions all relating to my part in the work.</p><p>
Q: ``Have I faith or understanding enough to work?''</p><p>
A: ``It is sufficient that you be true drop by drop.'' Here I see a large temple 
in which the great work is being carried on. I am humbly kneeling and a few 
pearls are dropping drop by drop through my fingers. I stop and carefully think 
over this question and answer and analyse them.</p><p>
Q: ``Should I renounce my professional work to serve the cause?''</p><p>
A: ``No, your true help and service depends upon the true you that you give.''</p><p>
Q: ``Will I be of great assistance to T. in his work in Egypt?''</p><p>
A: I see the temple full of many boxes as in a factory -- there is an apparent 
confusion. Some of the boxes could be set aside and lost; some could be sent to 
the wrong place; and some could be sent out and reach the right destination. 
``Yes, in so far as T. uses only gold.'' (This means to me that T. must take 
only the best of me and not confuse the dross with the gold.)</p><p>
Q: ``Are my feelings about my responsibility in going the right ones?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes, and forever.'' I see a ram with beautiful circles around his head.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday] February 24, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
W.T.L.O.O.D.</p><p>
As I approach the wizard he beckons me to go up the mountain path with him. I 
stay at the woodland place to ask him questions. After I ask the first question, 
he again points to the path.</p><p>
I now see Barzedon with a parcel in her lap. The parcel is something like an 
object in wooden splints wrapped in paper. There are the pink and plump feet of 
a baby sticking out. The baby is alive: its name is (Eperqv) &lt;&lt;? 388; the 
hardest rock; to seek diligently; table; bread. 4 = 97.&gt;&gt; In some way a clerk in 
a store is connected with this. On his left there is a ledger on which is 
written ``Good.''</p><p>
T: ``Who is the mother of this child?''</p><p>
A: I see a horn of plenty (Demeter) -- the wheels of an aeroplane -- The 
w[izard] says ``Much.''</p><p>
T: ``Who is the father?''</p><p>
A: I see a skeleton of a buggy. ``Bay -- Bane -- Bale.'' These all seem to mean 
some word, probably beginning with `b'. Bale seems to suggest bales of hay. I 
also see a daisy and then a stream. (Daisy = Sol, obviously.)</p><p>
T: ``What is the number for the Mother?''</p><p>
A: ``63 or 639.'' (Briah. Tree of knowledge.)</p><p>
T: ``What is the number for the father?''</p><p>
A: ``483 or 487.'' (483 is bearer of iniquity. 3 x 161 the exempted man.)</p><p>
T: ``What is the number for (Eperov)?''</p><p>
A: ``437.'' (Balm; balsam tree. 19 x 23.)</p><p>
T: ``Is the baby a girl or a boy?''</p><p>
A: I see a young man's head with very dark hair.</p><p>
All of these above questions about the numbers and whether (E.) is a girl or a 
boy were asked without the words being said. That is, the answer was asked to 
the question that was in T.'s mind.</p><p>
Q: ``Give me the true magical name of D.T.?'' (Dorothy Troxel.)</p><p>
A: ``Wesrun.'' This is a Druid word? The letters can be used as Hebrew. (627 = 
209 x 3: 33 x 19.) (Good.)</p><p>
Q: ``What is her number?''</p><p>
A: ``817.'' (19 x 43 = Hazel.)</p><p>
Q: ``Is this the person in T.'s vision in N[ew] H[ampshire] ?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.'' (She was a `hazel' girl. T[herion].)</p><p>
Now I am wandering up the mountain path with the w. We are a little way up. He 
looks like an Arab, has on a white turban. I have on a brown cotton crepe dress. 
He is stopped and is standing in the main path while I am to one side on the 
beginning of a large level place on the mountain side. Some distance away and 
further out on the level space is a dark haired young man. Both the young man's 
head and my back are turned this way. The w. is almost facing this way. I see a 
confused sculptural group or figure on top of which there is a brilliant red 
four petalled flower. The ends of the petals droop down which gives it a 
cross-like appearance. The w. looks at me with a kind of admiration and sympathy 
or friendliness. An animal like a fox (really a chamois, I believe) comes from 
around the mountain towards me. There is a small snake at my feet. Now the place 
where I am standing is isolated with 20 -- 25 feet between us and the rest of 
the mountain. A sort of crevice is all around me. I ask the w. what it means and 
see ripe corn. Now I see myself with green corn in my lap preparing it for 
cooking. This means that I am at Nepta. A. admired me because I was climbing up 
seeking truth. This stopping on the way is a sort of being side tracked in what 
Nepta would be. That is I would stop and bask in the sunlight of sensual 
pleasures or emotional enjoyment of such a life. (I do not like this thought. It 
makes me think of what it would mean in sacrificing real work.) As I keep 
looking at myself on this isolated spot, I am sometimes all alone as at first, 
and then there are many people and many confused things all around me. A. 
explains that my going to E[gypt] in face of objections and obstacles is 
represented by my being alone. It is then that he admires me. The confused mass 
of things and the people around me are the remnants of illusions etc., etc., I 
have not yet broken clear of. I ask A. if he has a message for T. We come down 
from the mountain to the woods. I see a fruit packing house, a bin for tomatoes, 
some straw in the bin and an egg in the straw. ``T. must work for the egg.''</p><p>
T: ``Are there any definite orders for the week?''</p><p>
A: I see T. in his office, also with a flower in his coat. He is rather happy. 
He is at his desk. There are many letters. One to D[orothy] T[roxel]. I also see 
2 books which were mailed.</p><p>
[9.30 p.m.]</p><p>
T. asks A. to spell Therion which he does.</p><p>
</p><p>
{P.S.: A letter was received from Palak, in Paterson, about the number of 
Therion adding to 666.</p><p>

My dear Viereck!</p><p>
I miss your plays in the Magazine: I mean those written by yourself, and yet no 
other publication furnishes anything half as good to feed my soul with -- and I 
am not capricious a bit -- or an idiot either -- as there will be many others 
who will agree with me along these points as true: (1) That The Philistine, The 
Fra and The Phoenix were the only magazines that furnished food for brain until 
recently when can be found in The International hardly better stuff than the 
Pearson's does except Frank Harris' own stuff.</p><p>
Please inform your readers that I Shmuel bar Aiwaz bie Yackou de Shirabad, have 
counted the number of a man Tau= 400 = Resh = 300 = Yod = 10 = Vau = 6 = Nin = 
50. Read from right to left.</p><p>
666}</p><p>
</p><p>
T: ``Does Egypt mean the (geographical country or the mystic expression?)'' 
(Asked without words.)</p><p>
A: Utter darkness appears. A man with a beast's head, something like a dog with 
a bird's beak for a nose. It is a hawk's head. I see a snake or scorpion. A 
nebula. Now there are many tiny chains at the feet of 729, coming from this 
nebula. Now an open door in a hut. A white cloth hangs on it. By this a tall 
palm, but its top is like a fir tree. A slender animal, somewhat like a calf is 
near A. In the air A. holds a small doll rather Japanese in appearance. This 
suggests Rodin's `Hand of God'. The doll has a cap on as if ready to go out. I 
see the egg and the eagle. The back of A.'s chair is shaped as a triangle, 
rather queer; almost as if the triangle were a solid.</p><p>
T. is very enraged and expresses his anger which completely destroys all 
communications. Later we try to ask more questions but it all seems to be of no 
use.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
[Sunday] March 3, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>

</p><p>
1.15 p.m.</p><p>
Getting ready for work. W.O.L.O.D.</p><p>
2.05</p><p>
729 is very majestic.</p><p>
T: ``Is there any news for us?''</p><p>
A: He is pleased with us. His face has a very richly gratified expression as if 
things were going better all the time.</p><p>
T: ``Is our operation going well?''</p><p>
A: A dark light appears on the head of a pole: it might be a headlight of an 
engine. ``Yes, in a measure.'' ``Your attitude is not quite right; in the will 
it is right, but you are formulating it badly.'' There is a single eye with a 
dark light in it looking towards me.</p><p>
T: ``Will the operation succeed?''</p><p>
A: 729 shakes his head. ``That depends.''</p><p>
T: ``On what?''</p><p>
A: There is a Chinese with his feet crossed, standing. He is in a yellow robe 
and has large ears. He is of gold. (He might be a source of gold? No, he will 
not.) There is a tall man of the caricature type of (Y.S.)&lt;&lt;(U.S.)&gt;&gt; standing by 
the place where I built the first fire. He has no face at all, but has dark 
straight hair. His hands are held out so that his fingers droop like claws. Very 
fierce.&lt;&lt;His hands in sign of enterer.&gt;&gt; A white goose goes by the turtle.</p><p>
Here we take up the question of the position of all the people and objects at 
the woodland place of 729. From now on we will call it a Temple.</p><p>
T: ``What is your letter?''</p><p>
A: ``Samekh.'' (Maybe Shin.)</p><p>
T: ``Why is there no officer to face the turtle?''</p><p>
A: ``The eagle is in that place but is in the air.''</p><p>
T: ``What does the turtle represent?''</p><p>
A: ``Prometheus. (!!!!) I see a fire and a building coming out of it.''</p><p>
T: ``What does the eagle represent?''</p><p>
A: The eagle is now choking a snake. It represent's Eve's function. (The turtle 
is male and the eagle female canals of force.) The child and the lion also 
balance (the two forms of Horus).</p><p>
T: ``Is there an officer in the cave?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes, a spider or a snake. Yes, a dragon.''</p><p>
T: ``What does the Temple represent?''</p><p>
A: Life -- Egypt work. Peter Pan, i.e. eternal youth. 729 Blood Sanguine.&lt;&lt;of 
`The Paris Working'.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
T: ``What Roman God?''</p><p>
A: Thor.&lt;&lt;Jupiter, as I foresaw. Note ( . . . ) as house of ( . . . ). 
Prometheus too, connected with Jupiter.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
( . . . )</p><p>

Began with Anh[alonium] L[ewinii] (complete failure).</p><p>
10.40</p><p>
Climax of operation for Belial.</p><p>
I see 729 with a large mushroom held on his shoulder as if it were an umbrella. 
He said we should work for success in making money. Now there is the head of a 
little bird and a rabbit. There is a large clump of palmettoes with ripe fruit; 
a railroad trestle across a stream and a mad dog drinking in the stream. There 
are tadpoles in the stream. Along the roadside there are many tiny frogs and 
some being run over by a wagon wheel. No 827.&lt;&lt;I am sure this was 837 q.v.n.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
T: ``Don't know it, try again.''</p><p>
A: 73.</p><p>
I suggest Belial as Demon of Hod, ( . . . ) commence) and he agrees; so we begot 
him.</p><p>
There is a covered wagon suggesting a turkey. Two bars are crossed upright. 
Someone is sending a bar about 4 by 1 1/2 feet from above. This keeps me from 
seeing Belial. Fire is issuing from under the bar suggesting the form of a 
brush.&lt;&lt;Note: Wizard's good Qabalah.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
1. Success in making money.</p><p>
2. 73. Belial = (Day-Demon)&lt;&lt;( [Night-Demon] )&gt;&gt; of 2nd decan Aquarius The lord 
of earned success ( . . . ) and is of Mercury in Aquarius, which is making 
money, not merely receiving it. He is also Demon King of Hod.</p><p>
3. Aquarius is on the Nadir at this ( . . . ) or nearby. (N.B. put up figure.) 
Note too: Anh. Lew. is a mercurial drug.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday March 10, 1918 e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
12.20 [a.m.]</p><p>
(Achitha) has been rolling about in agony. The God Mercury being too pure for 
her corrupt mind and body.</p><p>
4.30 a.m.</p><p>
Awoke feeling fairly well. To sleep about 5.15.</p><p>
9.00 a.m.</p><p>
Awoke refreshed and normal.</p><p>
Note on Belial. His colleague by day in 2nd decan Aquarius is Asmodee. We must 
beget him. He has 3 heads, bull, man, ram, snake's tail, goose's feet, rides 
with lance and banner on a dragon. Any desired Tarot Card can be invoked in this 
IX Degree way by begetting its hierarchy, and giving them our own bodies to 
manifest through, by (feeding) &lt;&lt;(feeling)&gt;&gt; the Eucharist. So then we turn our 
own selves into talismans of Earned Success or the like. Names of Goetia Demons 
can be used.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
2.35 p.m.</p><p>
Q: Why doesn't 31 suit Achitha?</p><p>
A: I see a placenta. 84. There is a pygmy with a wand in his hand. He runs round 
the hillside. He suggests to me the story of Snow White. There is a field of 
daisies. There is the head of a duck with a large beak. This means that I took 
too much.</p><p>
Q: ``Is this all rational?''</p><p>
A: ``Yes.'' 729 says that I must take H[ashis]H drop by drop this p.m.</p><p>
Q: ``Which this p.m., HH or 31?''</p><p>
A: I see negroes trampling HH.</p><p>
Q: ``What duty to-day?''</p><p>
A: I see a luminous white cloth wrinkled together. Under it there is a cup. 
There is blood or wine in the cup, around it is a wreath of pearls. There is a 
tiny lion on top of the liquid, also a turtle, which is very cunning. Now there 
is a balance. (734 combines all this.) ( = to bring forth.)</p><p>
Q: T.b.f.w.? (To bring forth what?)</p><p>
A: I see a raft or catamaran; a tiger skin is on the raft; there is a native on 
this. And somewhere near there are two grey rats and a pig's head. (81 combines 
this.)</p><p>
Q: ``Does this mean solve question of T.'s `Guides'? ''</p><p>
A: Yes and something more.</p><p>
3.50</p><p>
Oper[ation] to know the powers of the Yoni. LXIV p[er] v[as] n[efandum]. 
Exceedingly spontaneous and majestic. Elixir a.1.</p><p>
81 = 9 to the second. Luna in Briah. ALHIM are the gods before the breath. H 
came to them, and made them creative. 81 can never be used for creative work but 
it is ideal for manipulations on one plane. Force cannot escape on to higher or 
lower. It's like shifting chessmen.</p><p>
6 p.m.</p><p>
I see 729 in a chair. He is a miniature pygmy. Everything is in perfect order at 
the Temple with billions of twinkles in form of golden and varicolored and 
particularly green leaves. O so beautiful! Because of this vision of the 
twinkling leaves back of the Temple it is proved that the Temple is correct.</p><p>
6.25</p><p>
T. saw most wonderful architectural visions. One building after another. Very 
good colors too. Mostly sublimation of memories. In fact he found none that 
could not be replaced.</p><p>

Operation for Asmodee.</p><p>
9.40</p><p>
Temple all right, but 729 is solemn and stern. Looks toward fire -- ashes. Goat 
on mountain. Things cold and silent, going not very well. Economics bad. 
Alzedarah tree by 729's chair and crocodile crawling up it. T.'s going to 
California (? Achitha's mind). 729 looks very ill. Pipe of peace -- near bowl is 
a lot of dark brown globules -- suggests a snake. Field with tiny trees at 729's 
feet. ``Work.'' Cocked hat. Widow in Church. Dove on sill. Crab. Sheep to be 
slaughtered. Tall official man with letter or paper -- Englishman. Old man in 
restuarant -- varied expressions on it. T: ``s.e.d.r.y.o.9.d.s.k.?'' (Is Marie 
friend or enemy to 729 and his work?)</p><p>
A: Pan's reed. 34. (Jupiter; ransom, avenge, pollute; reveal; angel of 7 Cups.)</p><p>

9 p.m.</p><p>
A light meal.</p><p>
9.20 p.m.</p><p>
729 careworn. Jesters are around him in air. There is a new turtle crawling 
around. Cornfield (as in the other vision) with rattlesnake. Fox in corn.</p><p>
T: ``M., B. or A.?'' (Mescal, Bhang or Aethyr?)</p><p>
A: B.! (He roars with laughter.) M. is right answer. In his hand a scarab of 
wood chained.</p><p>
T: ``What work should we do this week end?''</p><p>
A: 391. (i.e. an operation of Kether.)</p><p>

87: (Determined.) 18 Tarot Card. Obj[ect] = Luna. (87 seems very lunar no.)</p><p>
17: To build or construct Temple of Nuit. (High Priestess of Temple of Nuit.)</p><p>
T: ``What number confirms idea of building Temple of Nuit?''</p><p>
A: ``10 Pantacles.'' ( = wealth -- Mercury in Virgo.)</p><p>
T: ``Pure number in Qabalah for same?''</p><p>

----------</p><p>
</p><p>
8:40 Arcteon {C. Stansfeld Jones} begins aethyr experiment.</p><p>
9:08 Arcteon says clock starts to go much quicker.</p><p>
9:18 Speeding up of time sense.</p><p>
9:22 Owing to the quickening of time, slight pain holding ether in lungs, is 
relieved because . . . of quickening of time sense.</p><p>
9:30 Did get past anaesthetic stage because he found that what we said about 
putting cork in bottle was True. When you first smell it, you think it's too 
pungent, later (a moral lesson).</p><p>
9:33 ( . . . ) Arcteon has heard T. snore since he took E[ther] last week end. 
You have to stand the full strength of a thing before you enjoy it.</p><p>
9:37 Now at the stage where he can understand what Achitha meant about being 
afraid of it. The barrier put there by Ego -- not particularly anxious to have 
it broken down. The passing from consciousness back to normal again must be a 
perfectly definite plane to most people.</p><p>
9:45 Inherent fear found by Arcteon of shutting mouth of bottle even after found 
Truth that you could take as much as you wanted. The danger of drug taking 
arrives at point where you do not know whether drug is friend of enemy.</p><p>
9:50 Have come to point where I open my eyes in order to see whether I am 
conscious or not. Sight is required to know whether one is conscious.</p><p>
9:54 When you are once used to E[ther] you can drink it. It is hard to destroy 
consciousness itself. It is hard to become unconscious.</p><p>
9:55 Getting easy on higher planes of ( . . . ) The real stage when T. reminded 
me to bring something out. (?) Surprising.</p><p>
10:03 ``If you hadn't been at 93, I wouldn't have said anything.''</p><p>
10:30 Reached stage where you can breathe ether through nose and mouth. Fear of 
death simply fear of loss of consciousness. Cowardly to speak so much of fear. 
Stage of having killed subconsciousness.</p><p>
10:31 Death superfluous. Now understands why Achitha laughed when taking too 
much. Also understands how absurd it is to say this. Important note. Change of 
consciousness = change of rapidity of vibration. Understand true point between 
sub-consciousness and unconsciousness.</p><p>
10:55 Reached stage when he is going to hang onto bottle as long as possible.</p><p>
11:03 Repetition of putting cork on a higher plane. Understands why drug taken. 
Laughs when others laugh.</p><p>
10:10 Consciousness as breath.</p><p>

T.'s pride rebuked. Alta tiera means Old Female</p><p>
Wild Beast.</p><p>

729 looks majestic, his beard longer and whiter: very sad but stronger. He's 
older.</p><p>
Temple as last Sunday. Olun &lt;&lt;Marie Lavroff&gt;&gt; has bird as before: her temple of 
Nuith is in the distance. Something queer -- pig on ground moving about.</p><p>
T: Give symbols for last week's work. Was it good?</p><p>
729: ``Yes.'' VI in Taro. (He's not smiling.) With the Tao.</p><p>
(VI interpreted as in [Liber] 418.)</p><p>

T: Her future action, then?</p><p>
A: 3 Wands. ( = Established strength. Sol in Aries.)</p><p>

A: To slay or kill. (A[chitha] gets these words without connection.) 865. ( = 19 
= Sol.)</p><p>
Spanish moss hanging from trees: humming-birds' nests in moss. A hawk. Snake in 
tree. Child building play- house in tree -- it's an oak. He has short stick. 
Tall pine with cones near. A farm plot around this. Moss burns up. Nests ditto 
and fall to the ground. Snake leaves tree. Hawk looks on. Child sees snake but 
plays with it happily. Oak only slightly burnt. Pine struck by lightning.</p><p>
T: Give me a number to express all this.</p><p>
A: 43. (Great; rejoice; make faint, Challah; hazel, almond.)</p><p>
T: What is next week's work?</p><p>
A: 765. ( = 18 = Pisces. (XV). 9 of Cups. Material Happiness. Jupiter in 
Pisces.)</p><p>

A: Write.</p><p>
T: What?</p><p>
A: Something to do with Levi.</p><p>
T: Show symbol to guide Ahitha in her trouble.</p><p>
A: Symbol of Venus.</p><p>
T: Confirm this.</p><p>
A: Angula polyporus -- white, undeveloped and gelatinous -- it soon bursts and 
deflouresces into a Winged Beetle.</p><p>
T: Confirm by number.</p><p>
A: 173. (Lighten mine eyes; 3rd decan Aquarius &amp; 7 Swords = unstable effort.)</p><p>
T: Tarot card for same?</p><p>
A: 8 of Cups. ( = abandoned success.)</p><p>
T: How will my affairs go?</p><p>
A: An ear of corn.</p><p>
T: Number to confirm?</p><p>
A: XVII. ( = The Star.)</p><p>
T: Pure number?</p><p>
A: 761. ( = XIV = Temperance.) (Don't understand.) 79. (Boaz and Jachin etc.)</p><p>
T: Will O.I.V.V.I.O. be able to join me soon?</p><p>
A: No. &lt;&lt;P.S.: This is the one point incorrect.&gt;&gt;</p><p>

Soror Bazedon goes to see the Wizard invoking him by the name of Amalantrah. 
Sees person ``as good as 729'' in desert.</p><p>
T: His name?</p><p>
A: Amalaftan.</p><p>
T: He says?</p><p>
A: Jargon. He'll take B[azedon] to 729. Oasis -- palms -- camel -- Arabs -- 
tent. Inside a reclining figure. He's 729.</p><p>
T: What about vision last night?</p><p>
A: Correct save in one point.</p><p>
T: What is coming as to 420? (Ahitha.)</p><p>
A: That must be worked out. Depends on T.</p><p>
T: What line should I take?</p><p>
A: The principal one.</p><p>
T: Give me a number to express that line.</p><p>
A: 527. (q.v.) Why haven't you paid more attention to it? All's in good order. 
T. has been slack.</p><p>
T: Will 156 reappear?</p><p>
A: I don't think so: must come by itself if it does.</p><p>
T: Any message for this moment?</p><p>
A: Go and see PROCANTUS.</p><p>
T: Explain that.</p><p>
A: Go and hear why he has not given you the right of way, he should not adorn 
himself with what does not belong to him for he is only a milestone on the way: 
he will not in any way secure the (plot).&lt;&lt;(plough)&gt;&gt;</p><p>

A: '88612476.</p><p>

At this point T. concentrated, but not strongly enough, on Wesrun.&lt;&lt;Dorothy 
Troxel&gt;&gt;</p><p>
A: Vancouver.</p><p>
T. had been thinking of Arcteon as he asked the question. He then concentrated 
properly on Wesrun.</p><p>
Travelling in light blue dress -- rejoicing over some accomplished work. Going 
to be a great person whom the Gods have favored.</p><p>
729 always close to 666 and interested.</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>

The striking feature this evening is the way in which the Wizard's left hand is 
held out.</p><p>
T: Present to him Nemo, a Master of the Temple. ( = O.I.V.V.I.O.) How is the 
Temple, is it in good shape?</p><p>

A: Owl then shewn to the seeress.</p><p>
T: On what Path should we walk?</p><p>
A: A.I.N.. (This is the Hebrew word for ``Nothing'' meaning that no work should 
be done that night.) Wesrun is a fool.</p><p>
T: Shall we hear from her soon?</p><p>
A: There is a bell ringing.</p><p>
T: And why has she not written?</p><p>
A: A big gun being fired. Ayin.</p><p>

Wizard -- same fence and field as last night. Wizard has a more solid quality.

on general principles?</p><p>

</p><p>
9.22 p.m.</p><p>
The Wizard has a very Scotch like face -- resembling the man in Simon Iff who 
was tortured and who tortured his wife. Same field and fence -- a little timid 
deer plays around -- Bazedon is always sitting down -- I get an impression of 
her as being very feminine a la Maeterlincke.</p><p>
T: We want to find out (a.) work for week-end and (b.) the prospects for next 
week.</p><p>
A: (a.) 3 Pantacles. (b.) Ace of Swords.</p><p>

T: Give us further symbols re prospects for week.</p><p>
A: 2 Cups.</p><p>
T: Does that mean H.N.?</p><p>
A: Resh.</p><p>
T: To whom does this refer?</p><p>
A: Refers to T.</p><p>
T: To whom else does it refer?</p><p>
A: B.N. (Tbn TbnbnTnT)</p><p>
T: How are we to take that B.N.?</p><p>
A: 87.</p><p>
T: To what person?</p><p>
A: 423. (Cannot get anything from that. T[herion].)</p><p>
T: There is still a confusion there. To what point of compass should I send my 
thought in this matter?</p><p>
A: South West. (Cannot get anything from that.) See if Dalet-Resh-Nun would help 
you.</p><p>
T: Yes I think it does in a way. Ask if we have done satisfactory work last 
week.</p><p>
A: ( = 820. Should take omen as meaning very complete but arduous.)</p><p>
T: How far are we right about things, we always want a little more than we get. 
I wonder if we are foolishly impatient.</p><p>
Achita fell asleep at this point. We all slept until the following day.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday] April 14, 1918 [e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
T: What is Wizard like?</p><p>
A: Just as he was last night.</p><p>
T: Has he any particular message to give us as a start?</p><p>
A: 82. (The angel of x and all sorts of nice things. Also Briatic Palace of Hod 
which would refer to job getting etc.) A[rcteon]: d.a.o.o.l.y.? (Should Ach[ita] 
go to Hospital to-day?)</p><p>
A: 9 Pantacles. (The lord of material gain.)</p><p>
A[rcteon]: s.t.l.t.n.s.a.l.b.? (Is it well that Therion takes a material job?)</p><p>
A: XVIII. (= Moon = illusion.)</p><p>
T: We want an elucidation of this answer.</p><p>
A: (Tzaddi-Qof-Peh = 270. Again doubtful.)</p><p>
T: What is the Wizard's plan in the matter. Get vision.</p><p>
A: Rat and snake on ground in front of Wizard -- a small stake on ground and 
beetles around. A large golden moon sailing on water -- Very beautiful -- Many 
little fancy boats around it sailing to a far distant place. In moon head of a 
beast appears. See baby killed and washed on shore. Woman comes down and picks 
baby up -- evidently not the mother -- She is sorry and suffers.</p><p>
T: Can you get a yes or no to this?</p><p>
A: ``Yes.'' See birds flying forming a beautiful figure as they fly. Also a 
rising ( . . . ) at which the Wizard is looking -- This is all according to his 
plan. He says ``Plan to get all I can'' . . . ``The sun, the moon, the stars to 
play with.'' Potatoes in a field.</p><p>
T: S.I.s.w.o.m.r.m.? (Shall I seek work outside my regular magick?)</p><p>
(I shall take beautiful visions as yes. Ugly ones as no.)</p><p>
A: Blue bird turned loose to fly -- thru deep dark woods with large beech trees 
-- a big bull snorting -- very magnificent! Wonderful!! Mountain with many 
stones ready to roll down if disturbed. Bird and bull beautiful . . .</p><p>
A: Water -- bottom of water nest with eggs -- beautiful bird flies down from sky 
and into water and sits on eggs. Tall snow capped mountain and trains climbing 
around winding track to top. Fine! Fields of very fine ripe tomatoes growing . . 
. A horse killed . . . rushing torrents of water . . . Beautiful summer cottages 
-- some empty, some full . . . Beautiful water in the distance with ducks on it. 
A boat and hunters in it.</p><p>
A: ``I think it was magnificent. Blue bird for happiness.''</p><p>
A[chitha] says Wizard let loose blue bird for happiness -- Bull for strength and 
virility.</p><p>
T: What does horse being killed mean?</p><p>
A: Sex being killed. Water = enlarged sexuality. Ducks,</p><p>
I don't know . . . Cottages -- home.</p><p>
T: Give a single pure number to symbolise the whole vision.</p><p>
A: 83. ( = The chief thing is consecration = 7 of Pantacles.) 2 of Pantacles. 
(Harmonised change.)</p><p>
T: Get two words, one to be a picture of doing the thing; one to be a picture of 
not doing it.</p><p>
A: 1. Elbaroth. (Aleph-Lamed-Beth-Resh-Ayin-Taw Tree of knowledge.)</p><p>
A: 2. Alestone. (Aleph-Lamed-Samekh-Taw-Ayin-Nun-Ayin Fear of the Lord of the 
Law.)</p><p>
T: Now get Tarot card for doing it and another for not doing it.</p><p>
A: 1. 7 of Cups. (Illusionary [sic] success.)</p><p>
A: 2. 8 of Pantacles. (Skill, prudence, cunning.)</p><p>
T: How does he seem about this? Does he seem insistent?</p><p>
A: ``Do with all thy might and let no man turn thee aside.''</p><p>
T: Do what?</p><p>
A: ``What thy hand findeth to do. Work to fill the store house. Accomplish thy 
will.''</p><p>
T: Get picture of store house.</p><p>
A: A busy factory.</p><p>
T: What sort of factory?</p><p>
A: Machines for printing.</p><p>
T: For printing what?</p><p>
A: Illuminated words and everyday words.</p><p>
T: Shall we all move outside limits of city to reside?</p><p>
A: 74. (Apparently means yes but Arcteon does not think so.)</p><p>
A: 7 of Wands. (Lord of valour, means not a bad plan, but very hard to manage 
it.)</p><p>
T: Hebrew letter.</p><p>
A: Daleth.</p><p>
T: S.I.b.s.i.I.a.f.w.o.n.? (Shall I be successful if I apply for work on a 
newspaper?) A picture to represent the thing.</p><p>
A: Col. river rushing down thru canyon. Horse on prairie fighting cold wind. Hut 
and dead man in it. Lake with fish in it. Lots of stakes and things tied to 
them. A lizard or alligator. Wizard has a scalpel in his hand. Is going to 
dissect an earthworm or something.</p><p>
T: Let me have a number.</p><p>
A: 371. ( = snowstorm.)</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Saturday] April 20th, 1918 e.v.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
8.45 p.m.</p><p>
Achitha says the Wizard has had his hair cut and beard trimmed, he looks much 
nicer this week.</p><p>
10.45 Achitha, Therion and Arcteon take 1 cc of Hashish.</p><p>
11.10 Achitha and Arcteon 1 cc Hashish.</p><p>
11.30 Achitha and Arcteon 1 cc Hashish.</p><p>
11.33</p><p>
T: Ask Wizard what should be the subject of our discourse this week end?</p><p>
A: 484. ( = 22squared.)</p><p>
11.45</p><p>
Wizard is there looking across Water. All there. A Donkey is grazing near base 
of mountain. Serpent is there. Mountain Goat on mountain. Chinese doll-head. 
White cliff. Priest in black with shining smooth satin gown. Chinese Lantern.</p><p>
T: Ask the Wizard to give us a philosophical phrase to express 22.</p><p>
A: Force of Will.</p><p>
T: Should the subject of our conversation be How to fix the effect of magical 
working in general and 9th Degree in particular?</p><p>
Achitha sees picture of Windram. Therion had never told her that he had this 
particular power in the greatest plentitude.</p><p>
T: We know that 22 is masculine and 19 feminine component of 418, which is the 
Key to this Magick of the Aeon. How do they combine? Are they being combined 
properly and so on?</p><p>
A: Vision of beautiful bell -- wedding bell -- changes to foetus. Crown. Head of 
foetus turns into an egg and rises upwards and then rests on a lotus flower.</p><p>
T: And that means what?</p><p>
A: Winged ladder. Ladder. Winged ladder which goes to heaven. Wings and sides 
white. Rungs almost pocket shaped.</p><p>
T: What are present instructions?</p><p>
11.55 Arcteon 2 cc.</p><p>
A: Crocodile -- unformed man. Shelf, place walled in -- on shelf skeleton. White 
flag. Skeleton's hand holds white flag. Large wall around place like butterfly 
net.</p><p>
T: Give Hebrew word to illustrate.</p><p>
A: He-Tzaddi-Yod-Vau. ( = 111.)&lt;&lt;N.B. The elixir must die in the Cucurbite and 
the 111 means this exactly. This recalls my dream and vision in N.Y. about 
killing the lion very dead indeed. It also explains the first answer to the 
question about the foetus becoming Harpocrates, cf. Jesus ``Except a corn of 
wheat . . . down to fruit.'' He-Tzaddi-Yod-Vau is the tetragrammaton of the 
magical officers. He(Hebrew) is the Emperor, and the Tzaddi the Empress, or High 
Priestess, vide secret attributions indicated in Liber CCXX. Yod is the Hermit 
and Vau the Hierophant who unites either with the High Priestess yet without 
destroying her virginity or with the more natural correlate. This word is 
therefore, a complete formula of the Gnostic and Templar mysteries, in one of 
its aspects.&gt;&gt; Daleth crowned with flowers.</p><p>
2:10</p><p>
Arcteon: How do you make it die in the circle?</p><p>
A: Great sphinx head, the top of which comes off like a lid -- inside are lots 
of things -- very tiny -- They look like human beings -- often with cloven feet 
like devils. They are not devils -- they are like satyrs or fauns. Sphinx is 
like hen sitting on eggs to hatch.</p><p>
Vision of man like shadow or ghost hurrying to distant place, and between me and 
ghost rain is falling. He is carrying important message.&lt;&lt;N.B. Sphinx is the 
lion and ghost is the will in it. Means perhaps something wrong in will in 
connection with lion. With ? it gives 115, to make strong, vehement/eager.&gt;&gt; </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
2.35</p><p>
T: How get ghost into sphinx?</p><p>
A: White dove flies away. King crowned turns to woman. They become two and 
prevent ghost getting to sphinx. ( Teth Picture of fall explains this.)</p><p>
A: Lamed-Samekh-Qof-Teth. ( = victories -- Yes.)</p><p>
T: What shall we do to improve our technique in charging talismans?</p><p>
A: Black lioness lying in street junctions -- resembles sphinx. (Concentrate 
better.)</p><p>
A: A burning tree. (Intensity of passion necessary.)</p><p>
T: How to kill sphinx?</p><p>
A: ``Make fast the chains.'' These bind the ships at the pier surging to get 
away. Tall woman in wonderful light -- dressed in brown. (Autumn?) Ostrich head 
in sand. Tzaddi-Yod-Vau-Resh is formula. (306 = woman, honey, cold etc.)</p><p>
T: Does that mean let it cold in the cucurbite?</p><p>
A: Resh-Vau-Dalet. ( = 210. Cycle etc. Nox etc.; Therefore = Yes.)</p><p>
T: How long should one leave it?</p><p>
A: 182. ( = Passive.)</p><p>
T: Repeat.</p><p>
A: 63. ( = Till creation takes place.)</p><p>
T: How many seconds or minutes for average?</p><p>
A: V ( = 6. Probably minutes or else symbolic.)</p><p>
T: Is there anything to do before collecting this `dead sphinx'?</p><p>
A: ( . . . )</p><p>
T: I.A.W.a.? (Is Anna Wright alive?)</p><p>
Suggested by resemblance to Ach[ita] under H[ashish]. Suggests did Anna W[right] 
die when spirit entered Ach[ita] or just before?</p><p>
Ach[ita] says R[oddie] M[inor] and Ach[ita] are two.</p><p>
T: Describe Achita.</p><p>
A: She is a woman rather dark, medium tall, neither fat nor thin. Her age is 
between 17 and 27.</p><p>
Had long discussion. Now Ach[ita] says she and R[oddie] M[inor] are one!!!</p><p>
Will try other ways.</p><p>
T: s.a.t.e. (Is Anna Wright alive?)</p><p>
A: Tzaddi-Gimel-Lamed. (123. Revolutions of souls, also war and a plague or blow 
or wound. Also Pleasure. See `On Death'.)</p><p>
T: In what country d.e.e.? (did she die?)</p><p>
A: Egypt.</p><p>
T: From what cause?</p><p>
A: A bird being chained to a door.</p><p>
T: What immediate cause?</p><p>
A: Lamed-Vau-Cheth-Mem. (A wing, army, squadron, troop.)</p><p>
T: How many months ago?</p><p>
Achita sleeps.</p><p>
</p><p>
Sunday [April 21, 1918 e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
9.20 [a.m.]</p><p>
Arcteon was ill during the night. Achita slept and Therion had the following 
vision which he dictated to Arcteon at 9.20.</p><p>
Critical glyphs, I saw how these are arranged. When any idea arises it is 
recorded automatically in every department of the mind. Each department 
immediately sends in a report as to how it is effected by the idea, but of 
course only those reports which are loud make themselves heard in the 
consciousness. I got a clear idea of the spider's web structure of the mind. The 
ahamkara appeared to me like a crystal, four hexagonal columns joined to the 
base (maybe octagonal, am not sure). And brought to a blunt point, each point 
occupying one of the angles of a tetrahedron which may explain the 
pyramid-phallus symbol. This glowed more or less brightly as each idea was 
recorded, rather like a tell-tale electric-light which registers a current 
passing thru a machine and gauges it. This crystal bulged or shrank to a certain 
extent from time to time but never lost the tetrahedral form. The colour of the 
light was that peculiar gold which jewellers call a rose finish. I am now 
reminded of the jewel of Mara. This glow is very closely connected with pleasure 
and pain. I got away from this by understanding it as a mere ganglion or node of 
the web and did several mystic stunts.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday April 21, 1918 e.v.]</p><p>
</p><p>
Achita with Wizard. (Same subject as last night.)</p><p>
T: How many months ago?</p><p>
A: Aleph-Resh-Vau. (207 = a scorpion.) (T[herion]: Might mean October.)</p><p>
T: To Achita a question. Do you regard Achitha as yourself or as a visit to a 
friend?</p><p>
Some argument follows!!!!!</p><p>
T: I want you to answer some questions regarding this portion of yourself you 
call Achita. What nationality is she?</p><p>
A[chita]: All or any, but more heavily dashed with European.</p><p>
T: What country mostly?</p><p>
A: I think Austria, Serbia or Bulgaria, none bound.</p><p>
T: What language or languages does she prefer to speak?</p><p>
A: English or French.</p><p>
T: Could she understand or speak French?</p><p>
A: Yes.</p><p>
T: Can you talk in French?</p><p>
A: No. She could understand other languages, but my brain is limited, I could 
not even repeat the words.</p><p>
T: The woman is like a donkey, ``You dangle a carrot in front of her nose and 
she goes wherever the carrot goes.''</p><p>
A: She is not a Lesbian.</p><p>
T: Has she any relations?</p><p>
A: None.</p><p>
T: How do you explain her apperance in your consciousness?</p><p>
A: Born of magic and Our Lady. Our Lady was the door through which magic put her 
in.</p><p>
T: What did she die of before she was born?</p><p>
A: I cannot answer. I have no understanding of that at all. Arcteon: Do you 
consider it possible to remain Achita all the time and not return to Roddie 
Minor?</p><p>
A: In a way yes and in a way no. Roddie Minor is only earth and works and lives. 
Achita is a spirit. Achita is one function, one thing among many in Roddie 
Minor.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
[Sunday] April 21, 1918 e.v.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Back to the Wizard.</p><p>
T: Is there anything to do before collecting the `dead sphinx'? [malantrah]: A 
lot of smoke boiling up from in front of the Wizard clears away. Two sticks 
charred as if fire had been there. Drop by drop -- I get again -- clear crystal 
drops and 163 as a number.</p><p>
T: This seems to mean pour drop by drop into a vessel. Should we use the vessel 
as we have been using to collect it?</p><p>
A: XVII Trump. (Means part poured on earth and part restored to temple.)</p><p>
T: With regard to the part to be consumed, is any further preparation necessary?</p><p>
A: 71.</p><p>
T: Am I right in taking that to mean nothing?</p><p>
A: I think you are.</p><p>
T: Then we now have the whole process complete and perfect?</p><p>
A: Yes.</p><p>
T: Alright.</p><p>
T: Is Anna Wright alive?</p><p>
A: I see a gondola or Greek galley -- very small.</p><p>
T: Who or what is in the boat?</p><p>
A: 14 Slaves work below. Beautiful Queen sits in state.</p><p>
T: Is there anything in front of her?</p><p>
A: Yes, a pile of something, it might be fruit or a flagon of wine.</p><p>
T: Give a number to represent that picture.</p><p>
A: 83. (Answer: Doubtful.)</p><p>
T: Give Tarot Trump.</p><p>
A: XI. (Again not clear.) Wizard says ``Stem the tide.''</p><p>
T: In reference to what is that?</p><p>
A: ( . . . )</p><p>
T: s.a.t.f.e.r.r.a.e.n.e.? (Is Achitha part of Roddie Minor or a separate human 
intelligence?)</p><p>
A: 43. (The sex self.) XIV. ( = i.) (arrow through rainbow = self shooting up 
through ecstacy or orgasm.)</p><p>
12.50 noon</p><p>
T: Is Mrs Agnes Thomas likely to be of any use in any capacity. If so in what 
capacity?</p><p>
A: 118. ( = To pass, renew, change; To ferment; Strength; Chassan; Ruler of Air; 
The High Priest.)</p><p>
T: What Sign of the Zodiac?</p><p>
A: ?.</p><p>
T: What planet?</p><p>
A: ?.</p><p>
T: Which House of Heaven does she fit?</p><p>
A: 4th House.</p><p>
T: What Court Card of Tarot represents her?</p><p>
A: Princess of Wands.</p><p>
T: What plain card?</p><p>
A: Six of Pantacles.</p><p>
T: Tarot Trump?</p><p>
A: IV. ( = Emperor = Aries.)</p><p>
T: Give a Chinese Symbol for her relation to us.</p><p>
A:<p align="center">
___<br>
___<br>
___<br>
_ _<br>
_ _<br>
___<p align="center">
[26] (Earth of Lingam. Great accumulation.)</p><p>
T: Has this woman an ordinary magical relation, or a Wizard magical relation?</p><p>
A: 518. (`Sepher Sephiroth' gives no correspondence.) ( = 37 = 14 = Magical Self 
in its function with card Temperance.)</p><p>
T: Do you see her in the Temple?</p><p>
A: No.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Sunday April 21, 1918 e.v.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
8.25 p.m.</p><p>

A: Resh-Teth-Qof.</p><p>
T: Give another symbol for how it is to come.</p><p>
A: 83. (Drops of dew, flowing, wave, camel and 2 of Pantacles.)</p><p>
T: Does that mean re Camel that Achitha has to find the money?</p><p>
A: XVI. Alligator head, round back part of neck a band of thick material, iron 
or leather. I see teeth of the alligator. Sticking up out of the band is a very 
queer 4 spoked thing, not a regular spear, more of a whale hook -- of bronze.</p><p>
T: Why cannot we get satisfactory answers re questions of money?</p><p>
A: Wand, wander.&lt;&lt;See note below&gt;&gt; 162. Gimel-Vau-Zain. ( = like = to, spelt 
backwards.)</p><p>
T: Give us a better meaning. Shall we bar subject in future, or shall we seek to 
clarify it? (1) Shall we bar the subject?</p><p>
A: Op[eratio]n for Red Gold is good for something but not for what you think.

</p><p>
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p><p>
Will = direct, straight line (as arrow)</p><p>
Euclid's straight line or right line is the shortest distance between two 
points. Thus right actually means right. All wrong is indication by definition 
-- as in wander, wanton, straight etc. Language itself bears witness to the Law.</p><p>
Wander -- wanton -- straight -- crooked -- connexion is Euclid's definition of a 
straight (right) line. Freudian!</p><p>
Wander suggests to our memorie we read to wander to love.</p><p>

continuity and this has.</p><p>
(Arcteon): T[herion] has been taking Hashish -- which may account for his ? 
jokes ?</p><p>
Achitha says she is f[ucke]d out.</p><p>
T: ``Achitha, can you see Wizard?''</p><p>
A: Not very well now . . . . . . . . whip.</p><p>
T[herion]:</p><p>
The apparent disconnected ravings of idiots may possibly represent the risings 
into consciousness of (nodes) upon the . . . . The subject was never changed in 
the world's history. One thing always leads to another like the Hex of . . . . . 
and the remark of the flea upon the . . . . . of Soror Achitha.</p><p>
Hashish brings the subconscious up into the con- scious. You see every item of 
the will. Ordinarily one thought seems as if complete in itself, under hashish 
you see all the different thoughts that go to make it up. Note the existence of 
one factor of the mind whose every sensation that comes up it throws into a 
class by itself, like dividing the sheep from the goats. Like an office, where 
certain people put things into different pigeon[holes], some judge them.</p><p>
If you concentrate on any one of these ideas, they cease to become verbal and 
become pictorial. Thus appreciation of colour is higher in scale of spiritual 
than reason is.</p><p>
All the mysteries of creation are really unveiled to one. This is the Shekinah, 
thoughts like flames in Sunlight. . . . Everything is clear -- cause and effect. 
. . . on every plane, abyss after abyss.</p><p>
Wisdom looms up into Glory and that gets down to the bottom again.</p><p>
The ( . . . ) is perpetual motion like an actress jumping through a hoop so that 
whether you go inwards towards wisdom or outward to glory, you are on the same 
old round. This is symbolized by Kaph. ( [10th Key of Tarot -- Hermanubis going 
up, Typhon going down.] )</p><p>
Arcteon's vow of silence cannot be such as to (------- B.S.) interfere with his 
power. I see all the steps whereby I arrive at the conclusion that Arcteon is an 
idiot -- which is a disgusting sight. But She's asleep.</p><p>
Voices just coming out of the departments.</p><p>
4.30</p><p>
Asleep more than 10 minutes.</p><p>
Lots of sentries all over the place, ready to report anything that comes to 
their notice.</p><p>
Spider's Web is the correct symbol.</p><p>
Probably self satisfaction to say that.</p><p>
Never mind onward the (Revd).&lt;&lt;(revel)&gt;&gt;</p><p>
The deepest thing of all is the one which sounds most foolish of all. That half 
broken down question I already forgot -- is the most important thing in the 
world. -- (Prolonged laughter). Oh, never in a million years will any one reach 
the understanding of this mystery, unless they do as I did. -- -- Every mystery 
is clear -- every sacrament is unveiled.</p><p>
She was really very tired, that was the reason for her temper ----- etc.</p><p>
The intervals between my sentences would over-flow a 3 vol novel.</p><p>
That sentinel is like a cathedral. I wish to God I could show you all the 
debacles by which it is built up, every step is made plain.</p><p>
</p><p>
9.35 p.m.</p><p>
T[herion] notes:</p><p>
American mind like consciousness under Hashish. Every one in America is crazily 
conscious of his own function and is proclaiming it aloud and is not conscious 
of any common purpose. (A.N.C.V.) Architecture reflects this fact. The sky 
scraper has hundreds of offices which are independent -- indifferent to each 
others' welfare. The building has no moral unity, as a cathedral has.</p><p>
The democratic idea is similarly 333. In the cathe- dral every item is 
subordinated to a single complete conception.</p><p>
Hashish is really temporary insanity, but owing to its democratic results it 
becomes impossible to get anywhere. This is one of the meanings of `Keep 
Silence'.&lt;&lt;The above thought is only the official view of one of my 
departments.&gt;&gt; All consciousness is pain. It seems only to come up to the 
attention when something is wrong.</p><p>
A department which watches the consciousness pays attention to what it says and 
guards its welfare. Therefore when there is nothing in the conscious- ness, this 
department has nothing to do, which it regards as an ideal state -- according to 
the general view -- consciousness is pain. -- All work is pain is the view of 
this department. This analysis is the foundation of the Buddhist theory.</p><p>
Hashish visions have been considered illusions -- nothing of the sort -- most 
true analysis. Hashish produces a moral not a mental insanity by removing the 
control which keeps all these things silent. It gives a voice to the mob. But 
each person in the mob is quite right from his own point of view. Each point of 
view is equally true and equally important, but not important to the state as a 
whole. The work of the individual is important -- but not his idea in doing the 
work.</p><p>
A hashish experiment is rather like going slumming -- one is amazed by the 
variety of the vividness of the impressions. And I think this is caused by a 
Freudian recognition. One sees again the things that used to be familiar in a 
simpler consciousness -- things long since buried -- the same thrill as re- 
visiting one's childhood. It is therefore a return or a retrogression in mental 
structure. A degeneration. Thus we see that analysis represents going back and 
synthesis -- advance.</p><p>
This again is proof of the nature of Choronzon. As dispersion represents 
analysis or destruction -- thus he is the enemy of man whose formula is creation 
by synthesis. This synthesis is Love. Hence it is written, Love is the Law. But 
this synthesis must be morally pointed to a definite purpose of which love is 
only the method. Hence it is written, Love under will. The law of Thelema is 
consequently a complete statement based on the facts of the structure of the 
mind.</p><p>
We go through about a million processes of debate -- all tremendously vivid and 
important, in order to make some trifling decision or jesting phrase showing the 
immense superiority of that normal mind -- to these vivid and violent 
impressions. Yet it is of course built up of them.</p><p>
Thus there is a picture of the true state. A vigorous, crude, highly coloured 
life of the common people.</p><p>
The polished silence of the gentleman is built up of all those vulgar elements, 
but has surpassed them, bringing them to silence of function.</p><p>
This is the English (equivalent) of society.</p><p>
All emotionalism is due to a crude appreciation of these elements, so that it 
too is a degeneration or as we say -- bad form.</p><p>
These thoughts . . . . . . are ablaze in consciousness owing to the inhibition 
of the moral faculty as above stated. But in samadhi the higher faculties are 
ablaze too, so that one gets the details and the sum of them all aflame at once 
in a super consciousness fitted to comprehend them in this way, which transcends 
the laws of logic, because in this consciousness one does see each and all at 
once.</p><p>
Expression is vulgar mob speech -- representing a low state of evolution. -- The 
more complex form of individual takes things for granted without going further 
into the old argument.</p><p>
Even chemistry illustrates this Social System, each element ceasing to assert 
its simple nature, and slightly subordinate in structure, to form the high-order 
molecule. Stability of molecule depends on completeness of satisfaction of the 
``will to love'' of each atom.</p><p>

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law</p><p>
Will = direct, straight line (as arrow)</p><p>
Euclid's straight line or right line is the shortest distance between two 
points. Thus right actually means right. All wrong is indication by definition 
-- as in wander, wanton, straight etc. Language itself bears witness to the Law.</p><p>
Wander -- wanton -- straight -- crooked -- connexion is Euclid's definition of a 
straight (right) line. Freudian!</p><p>
Wander suggests to our memorie ( . . . ) we read to wander to love.
