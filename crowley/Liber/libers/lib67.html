            <blockquote>
                <p>I flung out of chapel and church<br>
                Temple and hall an meeting-room <br>
                Venus' Bower and Osiris' Tomb, <br>
                and left the devil in the lurch, <br>
                While God got lost in the crowd of gods, <br>
                And soul went down in the turbid tide <br>
                Of the metaphysical Lotus-eyed, <br>
                And I was -- anyhow, what's the odds? <br>
                [...] <br>
                Yet by-and-by I hope to weave <br>
                A song of Anti-Christmas Eve <br>
                And First- and Second-Beast-er Day. <br>
                There's one who loves me dearly (vrai!) <br>
                Who yet believes me sprung from Tophet, <br>
                Either the Beast or the False Prophet; <br>
                And by all sorts of monkey tricks <br>
                Adds up my name to Six Six Six. <br>
                Retire, good Gallup! In such strife her <br>
                Superior skill makes <em>you</em> a cipher! <br>
                Ho! I adopt the number. Look <br>
                At the quaint wrapper of this book! <br>
                I will deserve it if I can: It is the number of a
                Man. </p>

                <p>I find some folks think me (for one) <br>
                So great a fool that I disclaim <br>
                Indeed Jehovah's hate for shame <br>
                That man to-day should not be weaned <br>
                Of worshipping so foul a fiend <br>
                In presence of the living Sun, <br>
                And yet replace him oiled and clean <br>
                By the Egyptian Pantheon, <br>
                The same thing by another name. <br>
                Thus when of late Egyptian Gods <br>
                Evoked ecstatic periods <br>
                In verse of mine, you thought I praised <br>
                Or worshipped them -- I stand amazed. <br>
                I merely wished to chant in verse <br>
                Some aspects of the Universe, <br>
                Summed up these subtle forces finely, <br>
                And sang of them (I think divinely) <br>
                In name and form; a fault perhaps -- <br>
                Reviewers are such funny chaps! <br>
                I think that ordinary folk, <br>
                Though, understood the things I spoke. <br>
                For Gods, and devils too, I find <br>
                Are merely modes of my own mind! </p>
