<h1 class="title" align="center">Liber B<br>
        vel Magi<br>
        sub Figura I</h1>
        <p>00. One is the Magus: twain His forces; four His
        weapons. These are the seven Spirits of Unrighteousness;
        seven vultures of evil. This is the art and craft of the
        Magus but glamour. How shall He destroy Himself?</p>
        <p>0. Yet the Magus hath power upon the Mother both
        directly and through love. And the Magus is Love, and
        bindeth together That and This in His Conjuration.</p>
        <p>1. In the beginning doth the Magus speak Truth, and
        send forth Illusion and Falsehood to enslave the soul.
        Yet therein is the Mystery of Redemption.</p>
        <p>2. By his Wisdom made He the Worlds: the World that is
        God is none other than He.</p>
        <p>3. Now then shall He end His Speech with Silence? For
        He is Speech.</p>
        <p>4. He is the First and the Last. How shall He cease to
        number Himself?</p>
        <p>5. By a Magus is this writing made known through the
        mind of a Magister. The one uttereth clearly, and the
        other Understandeth; yet the Word is falsehood, and the
        Understanding darkness. And this saying is of All Truth.</p>
        <p>6. Nevertheless it is written; for there be times of
        darkness, and this as a lamp therein.</p>
        <p>7. With the Wand createth He.</p>
        <p>8. With the Cup preserveth He.</p>
        <p>9. With the Dagger destroyeth He.</p>
        <p>10. With the Coin redeemeth He.</p>
        <p>11. His weapons fulfil the wheel; and on What Axle
        that turneth is not known unto Him.</p>
        <p>12. From all these actions must He cease before the
        curse of His Grade is uplifted from Him. Before He attain
        to that which existeth without Form.</p>
        <p>13. And if at this time He be manifested upon earth as
        a Man, and therefore is this present writing, let this be
        His method, that the curse of His grade, and the burden
        of His attainment, be uplifted from Him.</p>
        <p>14. Let Him beware of abstinence from action. For the
        curse of His grade is that he must speak Truth, that the
        Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of men. Let Him
        then utter that without Fear, that the Law may be
        fulfilled. And according to His Original Nature will that
        law be shapen, so that one may declare gentleness and
        quietness, being an Hindu; and another fierceness and
        servility, being a Jew; and yet another ardour and
        manliness, being an Arab. Yet this matter toucheth the
        mystery of Incarnation, and is not here to be declared.</p>
        <p>15. Now the grade of a Magister teacheth the Mystery
        of Sorrow, and the grade of a Magus the Mystery of
        Change, and the grade of Ipsissimus the Mystery of
        Selflessness, which is called also the Mystery of Pan.</p>
        <p>16. Let the Magus then contemplate each in turn,
        raising it to the ultimate power of Infinity. Wherein
        Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness
        is Self. For the interplay of the parts hath no action
        upon the whole. And this contemflation shall be performed
        not by simple meditation --- how much less then by
        reason! --- but by the method which shall have been given
        unto Him in His initiation to the Grade.</p>
        <p>17. Following which method, it shall be easy for Him
        to combine that rinity from its elements, and further to
        combine Sat-Chit-Ananda, and Light, Love, Life, three by
        three into nine that are one, in which meditation success
        shall be That which was first adumbrated to Him in the
        grade of Practicus (which reflecteth Mercury into the
        lowest world) in Liber XXVII, &quot;Here is Nothing under
        its three forms.&quot;</p>
        <p>18. And this is the Opening of the Grade of
        Ipsissimus, and by the Buddhists it is called the trance
        Nerodha-Samapatti.</p>
        <p>19. And woe, woe, woe, yea woe, and again woe, woe,
        woe, unto seven times be His that preacheth not His law
        to men!</p>
        <p>20. And woe also be unto Him that refuseth the curse
        of the grade of a Magus, and the burden of the Attainment
        thereof.</p>
        <p>21. And in the word CHAOS let the book be sealed, yea,
        let the Book be sealed.</p>
