				<p align="left">My name is Lola, because I am the Key of 
				Delights, and the other children in my dream call me Lola 
				Daydream. When I am awake, you see, I know that I am dreaming, 
				so that they must be very silly children, don't you think? There 
				are people in the dream, too, who are quite grown up and horrid; 
				but the really important thing is the wake-up person. There is 
				only one, for there could never be any one like him. I call him 
				my Fairy Prince. He rides a horse with beautiful wings like a 
				swan, or sometimes a strange creature like a lion or a bull, 
				with a woman's face and breasts, and she has unfathomable eyes.
				</p>
				<p align="left">My Fairy Prince is a dark boy, very comely; I 
				think every one must love him, and yet every one is afraid. He 
				looks through one just as if one had no clothes on in the Garden 
				of God, and he had made one, and one could do nothing except in 
				the mirror of his mind. He never laughs or frowns or smiles; 
				because, whatever he sees, he sees what is beyond as well, and 
				so nothing ever happens. His mouth is redder than any roses you 
				ever saw. I wake up quite when we kiss each other, and there is 
				no dream any more. But when it is not trembling on mine, I see 
				kisses on his lips, as if he were kissing some one that one 
				could not see.</p>
				<p align="left">Now you must know that my Fairy Prince is my 
				lover, and one day he will come for good and ride away with me 
				and marry me. I shan't tell you his name because it is too 
				beautiful. It is a great secret between us. When we were engaged 
				he gave me such a beautiful ring.</p>
				<p align="left">It was like this. First there was his shield, 
				which had a sun on it and some roses, all on a kind of bar; and 
				there was a terrible number written on it. There was a bank of 
				soft roses with the sun shining on it, and above there was a red 
				rose on a golden cross, and then there was a three-cornered 
				star, shining so bright that nobody could possibly look at it 
				unless they had love in their eyes; and in the middle was an eye 
				without an eyelid. That could see anything, I should think, but 
				you see it could never go to sleep, because there wasn't any 
				eyelid. On the sides were written I.N.R.I. and T.A.R.O., which 
				mean many strange and beautiful things, and terrible things too. 
				I should think any one would be afraid to hurt any one who wore 
				that ring. It is all cut out of amethyst, and my Fairy Prince 
				said: &quot;Whenever you want me, look into the ring and call me ever 
				so softly by my name, and kiss the ring, and worship it, and 
				then look ever so deeply into it, and I will come to you.&quot; So I 
				made up a pretty poem to say every time I woke up, for you see I 
				am a very sleepy girl, and dream ever so much about the other 
				children; and that is a pity, because there is only one thing I 
				love, and that is my Fairy Prince. So this is the poem I did to 
				worship the ring, part is words, and part is pictures. You must 
				pick out what the pictures mean, and then it all makes poetry.</td>

				<p align="left">I have not told you anything about myself, 
				because it doesn't really matter; the only thing I want to tell 
				you about is my Fairy Prince. But as I am telling you all this, 
				I am seventeen years old and very fair when you shut your eyes 
				to look; but when you open them, I am really dark, with fair 
				skin. I have ever-such heaps of hair, and big, big, round eyes, 
				always wondering at everything. Never mind, it's only a 
				nuisance. I shall tell you what happened one day when I said the 
				poem to the ring. I wasn't really quite awake when I began, but 
				as I said it, it got brighter and brighter, and when I came to 
				&quot;ring of Amethyst&quot; the fifth time (there are five verses, 
				because my lover's name has five V's in it), he galloped across 
				the beautiful green sunset, spurring the winged horse, till the 
				blood made all the sky turn rosy red. So he caught me up and set 
				me on his horse, and I clung to his neck as we galloped into the 
				night. Then he told me he would take me to his Palace and show 
				me everything, and one day when we were married I should be 
				mistress of it all. Then I wanted to be married to him at once, 
				and then I saw it couldn't be, because I was so sleepy and had 
				bad dreams, and one couldn't be a good wife if one is always 
				doing that sort of thing. But he said I would be older one day, 
				and not sleep so much, and every one slept a little, but the 
				great thing was not to be lazy and contented with the dreams, so 
				I mean to fight hard.</p>
				<p align="left">By and by we came to a beautiful green place 
				with the strangest house you ever saw. Round the big meadow 
				there lay a wonderful snake, with steel gray plumes, and he had 
				his tail in his mouth, and kept on eating it and eating it, 
				because there was nothing else for it to eat, and my Fairy 
				Prince said he would go on like that till there was nothing left 
				at all. Then I said it would get smaller and smaller and crush 
				the meadow and the palace, and I think perhaps I began to cry. 
				But my Fairy Prince said: &quot;don't be such a silly!&quot; and I wasn't 
				old enough to understand all that it meant, but one day I should 
				and all one had to do was to be as glad as glad. So he kissed 
				me, and we got off the horse, and he took me to the door of the 
				house, and we went in. It was frightfully dark in the passage, 
				and I felt tied so that I couldn't move, so I promised to myself 
				to love him, and he kissed me. It was dreadfully, dreadfully 
				dark though, but he said not to be afraid, silly! And it's 
				getting lighter, now keep straight forward, darling! And then he 
				kissed me again, and said: &quot;Welcome to my Palace!&quot;</p>
				<p align="left">I will tell you all about how it was built, 
				because it is the most beautiful place that ever was. On the 
				sunset side were all the baths, and the bedrooms were in front 
				of us as we were. The baths were all of pale olive-coloured 
				marble, and the bedrooms had lemon-coloured everything. Then 
				there were the kitchens on the sunrise side, and they were 
				russet, like dead leaves are in autumn in one's dreams. The 
				place we had come through was perfectly black everything, and 
				only used for offices and such things. There were the most 
				horrid things everywhere about; black beetles and cockroaches, 
				and goodness knows what; but they can't hurt when the Fairy 
				Prince is there. I think a little girl would be eaten though if 
				she went in there alone.</p>
				<p align="left">Then he said: &quot;Come on! This is only the 
				servants' hall, nearly everybody stays here all their lives.&quot; 
				And I said: &quot;Kiss me!&quot; So he said: &quot;Every step you take is only 
				possible when you say that.&quot; We came to a dreadful dark passage 
				again, so narrow and low, that it was like a dirty old tunnel, 
				and yet so vast and wide that everything in the whole world was 
				contained in it. We saw all the strange dreams and awful shapes 
				of fear, and really I don't know how we ever got through, except 
				that the Prince called for some splendid strong creatures to 
				guard us. There was an eagle that flew, and beat his wings, and 
				tore and bit at everything that came near; and there was a lion 
				that roared terribly, and his breath was a flame, and burnt up 
				the things, so that there was a great cloud; and rain fell 
				gently and purely, so that he really did the things good by 
				fighting them. And there was a bull that tossed them on his 
				horns, so that they changed into butterflies; and there was a 
				man that kept telling everybody to be quiet and not make a 
				noise. So we came at last in the next house of the Palace. It 
				was a great dome of violet, and in the centre the moon shone. 
				She was a full moon, and yet she looked like a woman quite, 
				quite young. Yet her hair was silver, and finer than spiders' 
				webs, and it rayed about her, like one can't say what; it was 
				all too beautiful. In the middle of the hall there was a black 
				stone pillar, from the top of which sprang a fountain of pearls; 
				and as they fell upon the floor, they changed the dark marble to 
				the colour of blood, and it was like a green universe of 
				flowers, and little children playing among them. So I said: 
				&quot;Shall we be married in this House?&quot; and he said: &quot;No, this is 
				only the House where the business is carried on. All the Palace 
				rests upon this House; but you are called Lola because you are 
				the Key of Delights. Many people stay here all there lives 
				though.&quot; I made him kiss me, and we went on to another passage 
				which opened out of the Servants' Hall. This passage was all 
				fire and flames and full of coffins. There was an angel blowing 
				on a trumpet, and people getting out of the coffins. My Fairy 
				Prince said: &quot;Most people never wake up for anything less.&quot; So 
				we went (at the same time it was; you see in dreams people can 
				only be in one place at a time; that's the best of being awake) 
				through another passage, which was lighted by the Sun. Yet there 
				were fairies dancing in a green ring, just as if it was night. 
				And there were two children playing by the wall, and my Fairy 
				Prince and I played as we went; and he said: &quot;The difference is 
				that we are going through. Most people play without a purpose; 
				if you are travelling it is all right, and play makes the 
				journey seem short.&quot; Then we came out into the Third (or Eighth, 
				it depends which way you count them, because there are ten) 
				House, and that was so splendid you can't imagine. In the first 
				place it was a bright, bright, bright orange colour, and then it 
				had flashes of light all over it, going so fast we couldn't see 
				them, and then there was the sound of the sea and one could look 
				through into the deep, and there was the ocean raging beneath 
				one's feet, and strong dolphins riding on it and crying aloud, 
				&quot;Holy! Holy! Holy!&quot; in such an ecstasy you can't think, and 
				rolling and playing for sheer joy. It was all lighted by a tiny, 
				weeny, shy little planet, sparkling and silvery, and now and 
				then then a wave of fiery chariots filled with eager spearmen 
				blazed through the sky, and my Fairy Prince said: &quot;Isn't it all 
				fine?&quot; But I knew he didn't really mean it, so I said: &quot;Kiss 
				me!&quot; and he kissed me, and we went on. He said: &quot;Good little 
				girl of mine, there's many a one stays there all his life.&quot; I 
				forgot to say that the whole place was just one mass of books, 
				and people reading them till they were so silly, they didn't 
				know what they were doing. And there were cheats, and doctors, 
				and thieves; I was really very glad to go away.</p>
				<p align="left">There were three ways into the Seventh House, 
				and the first was such a funny way. We walked through a pool, 
				each on the arm of a great big Beetle, and then we found 
				ourselves on a winding path. There were nasty Jackals about, 
				they made such a noise, and at the end I could see two towers. 
				Then there was the queerest moon you ever saw, only a quarter 
				full. The shadows fell so strangely, one could see the 
				mysterious shapes, like great bats with women's faces, and blood 
				dripping from their mouths, and creatures partly wolves and 
				partly men, everything changing one into the other. And we saw 
				shadows like old, old, ugly women, creeping about on sticks, and 
				all of a sudden they would fly up into the air, shrieking the 
				funniest kind of songs, and then suddenly one would come down 
				flop, and you saw she was really quite young and ever so lovely, 
				and she would have nothing on, and as you looked at her she 
				would crumble away like a biscuit. Then there was another 
				passage which was really too secret for anything; all I shall 
				tell you is, there was the most beautiful Goddess that ever was, 
				and she was washing herself in a river of dew. If you ask what 
				she is doing, she says: &quot;I'm making thunderbolts.&quot; It was only 
				starlight, and yet one could see quite clearly, so don't think 
				I'm making a mistake. The third path is a most terrible passage; 
				it's all a great war, and there's earthquakes and chariots of 
				fire, and all the castles breaking to pieces. I was glad when we 
				Came to the Green Palace.</p>
				<p align="left">It was all built of malachite and emerald, and 
				there was the loveliest gentlest living, and I was married to my 
				Fairy Prince there, and we had the most delicious honeymoon, and 
				I had a beautiful baby, and then I remembered myself, but only 
				just in time, and said: &quot;Kiss me!&quot; And he kissed me and said: 
				&quot;My goodness! But that was a near thing that time; my little 
				girl nearly went to sleep. Most people who reach the Seventh 
				House stay there all their lives, I can tell you.&quot;</p>
				<p align="left">It did seem a shame to go on; there was such a 
				flashing green star to light it, and all the air was filled with 
				amber-coloured flames like kisses. And we could see through the 
				floor, and there were terrible lions, like furnaces for fury, 
				and they all roared out: &quot;Holy! Holy! Holy!&quot; and leaped and 
				danced for joy. And when I saw myself in the mirrors, the dome 
				was one mass of beautiful green mirrors, I saw how serious I 
				looked, and that I <i>had </i>to go on. I hoped the Fairy Prince 
				would look serious too, because it is a most dreadful business 
				going beyond the Seventh House; but he only looked the same as 
				ever. But oh! How I kissed him, and how I clung to him, or I 
				think I should never , never have had the courage to go up those 
				dreadful passages, especially knowing what was at the end of 
				them. And now I'm only a little girl, and I'm ever so tired of 
				writing, but I'll tell you all about the rest another time.</td>

		<p align="center">Explicit Capitulum Primum</p>
		<p align="center">vel De Collegio Externo.</i><font size="1"></p>
		</font>
		<p align="center">PART II</p>
		<p align="left">I was telling you how we started from the Green Palace. 
		There are three passages that lead to the Treasure House of Gold, and 
		all of them are very dreadful. One is called Terror by Night, and 
		another the Arrow by Day, and the third has a name that people are 
		afraid to hear, so I won't say.</p>
		<p align="left">But in the first we came to a mighty throne of gray 
		granite, shaped like the sweetest pussy cat you ever saw, and set up on 
		a desolate heath. It was midnight, and the Devil came down and sat in 
		the midst; but my Fairy Prince whispered: &quot;Hush! It is a great secret, 
		but his name is Yeheswah, and he is the Saviour of the World.&quot; And that 
		was very funny, because the girl next me thought it was Jesus Christ, 
		till another Fairy Prince (my Prince's brother) whispered as he kissed 
		her: &quot;Hush, tell nobody ever, that is Satan, and he is the Saviour of 
		the World.&quot;</p>
		<p align="left">We were a very great company, and I can't tell you of 
		all the strange things we did and said, or of the song we sang as we 
		danced face outwards in a great circle ever closing in on the Devil on 
		the throne. But whenever I saw a toad or a bat, or some horrid insect, 
		my Fairy Prince always whispered: &quot;It is the Saviour of the World,&quot; and 
		I saw that it was so. We did all the most beautiful wicked things you 
		can imagine, and yet all the time knew they were good and right, and 
		must be done if ever we were to get to the House of Gold. So we enjoyed 
		ourselves very much and ate the most extraordinary supper you can think 
		of. There were babies roasted whole and stuffed with pork sausages and 
		olives; and some of the girls cut off chops and steaks from their own 
		bodies, and gave them to a beautiful white cook at a silver grill, that 
		was lighted with the gas of dead bodies and marshes; and he cooked them 
		splendidly, and we all enjoyed it immensely. Then there was a tame goat 
		with a gold collar, that went about laughing with everyone; and he was 
		all shaved in patches like a poodle. We kissed him and petted him, and 
		it was lovely. You must remember that I never let go of my Fairy Prince 
		for a single instant, or of course I should have been turned into a 
		horrid black toad.</p>
		<p align="left">Then there was another passage called the Arrow by Day, 
		and there was a most lovely lady all shining with the sun, and moon, and 
		stars, who was lighting a great bowl of water with one hand, by dropping 
		dew on it out of a cup, and with the other she was putting out a 
		terrible fire with a torch. She had a red lion and a white eagle, that 
		she had always had ever since she was a little girl. She had found them 
		in a nasty pit full of all kinds of nasty filth, and they were very 
		savage; but by always treating them kindly they had grown up faithful 
		and good. This should be a lesson to all of us never to be unkind to our 
		pets.</p>
		<p align="left">My Fairy Prince was laughing all the time in the third 
		path. There was nobody there but an old gentleman who had put on his 
		bones outside, and was trying ever so hard to cut down the grass with a 
		scythe. But the faster he cut it the faster it grew. My Fairy Prince 
		said: &quot;Everybody that ever was has come along this path, and yet only 
		one ever got to the end of it.&quot; But I saw a lot of people walking 
		straight through as if they knew it quite well; he explained, though, 
		that they were really only one; and if you walked through that proved 
		it. I thought that was silly, but he's much older and wiser than I am; 
		so I said nothing. The truth is that it is a very hard </p>
		<p align="left">Palace to talk about, and the further you get in, the 
		harder it is to say what you mean because it all has to be put into 
		dream talk, as of course the language of the wake-world is silence.</p>
		<p align="left">So never mind! Let me go on. We came by and by to the 
		Sixth House. I forgot to say that all those three paths were really one, 
		because they all meant that things were different inside to outside, and 
		so people couldn't judge. It was fearfully interesting; but mind you 
		don't go in those passages without the Fairy Prince. And of course 
		there's the Veil. I don't think I'd better tell you about the Veil. I'll 
		only put your mouth to my head, and your hand - there, that'll tell any 
		body who knows that I've really been there, and that it's all true that 
		I'm telling you.</p>
		<p align="left">This Sixth House is called the Treasure House of Gold; 
		it's a most mysterious place as ever you were in. First there's a tiny, 
		tiny, tiny doorway, you must crawl through on your hands and knees; and 
		even then I scraped ever such a lot of skin off my back; then you have 
		to be nailed on a red board with four arms, with a great gold circle in 
		the middle, and that hurts you dreadfully. Then they make you swear the 
		most solemn things you ever heard of, how you would be faithful to the 
		Fairy Prince, and live for nothing but to know him better and better. So 
		the nails stopped hurting, because, of course, I saw that I was really 
		being married, and this was part of it, and I was as glad as glad; and 
		at that moment my Fairy Prince put his hand on my head, and I tell you, 
		honour bright, it was more wakeup than ever before, even than when he 
		used to kiss me. After that they said I could go into the Bride-chamber, 
		but it was only the most curious room that ever was with seven sides. 
		There was a dreadful red dragon on the floor, and all the sides were 
		painted every colour you can think of, with curious figures and 
		pictures. The light was not like dream light at all; it was wake light 
		and it came through a beautiful rose in the ceiling. In the middle was a 
		table all covered with beautiful pictures and texts, and there were ever 
		such strange things on it. There was a little crucifix in the middle, 
		all of diamonds and emeralds and rubies, and other precious stones, and 
		there was a dagger with a golden handle, and a cup of the most delicious 
		wine, and there was a curious coin with the strangest writing on it, and 
		a funny little stick that was covered with flames, like a rose tree is 
		with roses. Beside the strange coin was a heavy iron chain, and I took 
		it and put it round my neck because I was bound to my Fairy Prince, and 
		I would never go about like other people till I found him again. And 
		they took the dagger and dipped it in the cup, and stabbed me all over 
		to show that I was not afraid to be hurt, if only I could find my Fairy 
		Prince. Then I took the crucifix and held it up to make more light in 
		case he was somewhere in the dark corners, but no! Yet I knew he was 
		there somewhere, so I thought he must be in the box, for under the table 
		was a great chest; and I was terribly sad because I felt something 
		dreadful was going to happen. And sure enough, when I had the courage, I 
		asked them to open the box, and the same people that made me crawl 
		through that horrid hole, and lost my Fairy Prince, and nailed me to the 
		red board, took away the table and opened the box, and there was my 
		Fairy Prince, quite, quite dead. If you only knew how sorry I felt! But 
		I had with me a walking-stick with wings, and a shining sun at the top 
		that had been his, and I touched him on the breast to try and wake him; 
		but it was no good. Only I seemed to hear his voice saying wonderful 
		things, and it was quite certain he wasn't really dead. So I put the 
		walking-stick on his breast, and another little thing he had which I had 
		forgotten to tell you about. It was a kind of cross with an oval handle 
		that he had been very fond of. But I couldn't go away without something 
		of his, so I took his shepherd's staff, and a little whip with blood on 
		it, and jewels oozing from the blood, if you know what I mean, that they 
		had put in his hands when they buried him. Then I went away, and cried, 
		and cried, and cried. But before I got very far they called me back; and 
		the people who had been so stern were smiling, and I saw they had taken 
		the coffin out of the little room with seven sides. And the coffin was 
		quite, quite empty. Then they began to tell us all about it, and I heard 
		my Fairy Prince within the little room saying holy exalted things, such 
		as the stars trace in the sky as they travel in the car called &quot;Millions 
		of Years.&quot; Then they took me into the little room, and there was my 
		Fairy Prince standing in the middle. So I knelt down and we all kissed 
		his beautiful feet, and the myriads of eyes like diamonds that were 
		hidden in his feet laughed joy at us. One couldn't lift one's head, for 
		he was too glorious to behold; but he spoke beautiful words like dying 
		nightingales that have sorrowed for the fading of roses, and pressed 
		themselves to death upon the thorns; and one's whole body became a 
		single eye, so that one saw as if the unborn thought of light brooded 
		over an eternal sea. Then there was light as the lightening flaming out 
		of the east, even unto the west, and it was fashioned as the swiftness 
		of a sword.</p>
		<p align="left">By and by one rose up, then one seemed to be quite, 
		quite dead, and buried in the centre of a pyramid of the most brilliant 
		light it is possible to think of. And it was wake-light too; and 
		everybody knows that even wake-darkness is really brighter than the 
		dream-light. So you might just guess what it was like. There was more 
		than that too; I can't possibly tell you. I know too what I.N.R.I. on 
		the ring meant: and I can't tell you that either, because the 
		dream-language has such a lot of important words missing. It's a very 
		silly language, I think. </p>
		<p align="left">By and by I came to myself a little, and now I was 
		really and truly married to the Fairy Prince, so I suppose we shall 
		always be near each other now.</p>
		<p align="left">There was the way out of the little room with millions 
		of changing colours, ever so beautiful, and it was lined with armed men, 
		waving their swords for joy like flashes of lightening; and all about us 
		glittering serpents danced and sang for joy. There was a winged horse 
		ready for us when we came out on the slopes of the mountain. You see the 
		Sixth House is really in a mountain called Mount Abiegnus, only one 
		doesn't see it because one goes through indoors all the way. There's one 
		House you have to go outdoors to get to, because no passage has ever 
		been made; but I'll tell you about that afterwards; it's the Third 
		House. So we got on the horse and went away for our honeymoon. I shan't 
		tell you a single word about the honeymoon.</td>

		</font>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">You mustn't suppose the honeymoon is ever really over, 
		because it just isn't. But he said to me: &quot;Princess, you haven't been 
		all over the Palace yet. Your <i>special</i> House is the Third, you 
		know, because it's so convenient for the Second where I usually live. 
		The King my Father lives in the First; he's never to be seen, you know 
		He's very, very old nowadays; I an practically Regent of course. You 
		must never forget that I am really He; only one generation back is not 
		so far, and I entirely represent his thought. Soon,&quot; he whispered ever 
		so softly, &quot;you will be a mother; there will be a Fairy Prince again to 
		run away with another pretty little Sleepy head. Then I saw that when 
		Fairy Princes were really and truly married they became Fairy Kings; and 
		that I was quite wrong ever to be ashamed of being only a little girl 
		and afraid of spoiling his prospects, because really, you see, he could 
		never become King and have a son, a Fairy Prince without me.</p>
		<p align="left">But one can only do that by getting to the Third House, 
		and it's a dreadful journey, I do most honestly assure you.</p>
		<p align="left">There are two passages, one from the Eighth House and 
		one from the Sixth; the first is all water, and the second is almost 
		worse, because you have to balance yourself so carefully, or you fall 
		and hurt yourself.</p>
		<p align="left">To go through the first you must be painted all over 
		with blood up to your waist, and cross your legs, and then put a rope 
		round one angle and swing you off. I had such a pretty white petticoat 
		on, and my Prince said I looked just like a white pyramid with a huge 
		red cross on the top of it, which made me ever so glad, because now I 
		knew I should be the Saviour of the World, which is what one wants to 
		be, isn't it? Only sometimes the world means all the other children in 
		the dream, and sometimes the dream itself, and sometimes the wake-things 
		one sees before one is quite, quite awake. The Prince tells me that 
		really and truly only the First House where his Father lives was really 
		a wake-house, all the others had a little sleep about them, and the 
		further you got the more awake you were, and began to know just how much 
		was dream and how much wake.</p>
		<p align="left">Then there was the other passage where there was a 
		narrow ledge of green crystal, which was all you had to walk on, and 
		there was a beautiful blue feather balancing on the edge, and if you 
		disturbed the feather there was a lady with a sword, and she would cut 
		off your head. So I didn't dare hardly to breathe, and all around there 
		were thousands and thousands of beautiful people in green who danced and 
		danced like anything, and at the end there was the terrible door of the 
		Fifth House, which is the Royal armoury. And when we came in the House 
		was full of steel machinery, some red hot and some white hot, and the 
		din was simply fearful. So to get the noise out of my head, I took the 
		whip and whipped myself till all my blood poured down over everything, 
		and I saw the whole House as a cataract of foaming blood rushing 
		headlong from the flaming and scintillating Star of Fire that blazed and 
		blazed in the candescent dome, and everything went red before my eyes, 
		and a great flame like a strong wind blew through the House with a noise 
		louder than any thunder could possibly be, so that I couldn't hold 
		myself hardly, and I took up the sharp knives of the machines and cut 
		myself all over, and the noise got louder and louder, and the flame 
		burnt through me and through me, so that I when my Prince said: &quot;You 
		wouldn't think it, would you, sweetheart? But there are lots of people 
		who stay here all their lives.&quot;</p>
		<p align="left">There are three ways into the Fourth House from below. 
		The first passage is a very curious place, all full of wheels and ever 
		such strange creatures, like monkeys and sphinxes and jackals climbing 
		about them and trying to get to the top. It was very silly, because 
		there isn't really any top to a wheel at all; the place you want to get 
		to is the centre, if you want to be quiet. Then there was a really 
		lovely passage, like a deep wood in Springtime, the dearest old man came 
		along who had lived there all his life, because he was the guardian of 
		it, and he didn't need to travel because he belonged to the First House 
		really from the very beginning. He wore a vast cloak, and he carried a 
		lamp and a long stick; and he said that the cloak meant you were to be 
		silent and not say anything you saw, and the lamp meant you were to tell 
		everybody and make them glad, and the stick was like a guide to tell you 
		which to do. But I didn't quite believe that, because I am getting a 
		grown-up girl now, and I wasn't to be put off like that. I could see 
		that the stick was really the measuring rod with which the whole Palace 
		was built, and the lamp was the only light they had to build it by, and 
		the cloak was the abyss of darkness that covers it all up. That is why 
		dream people never see beautiful things like I'm telling you about. All 
		their houses are built of common red bricks, and they sit in them all 
		day and play silly games with counters, and oh! Dear me, how they do 
		chat and quarrel. When any one gets a million counters, he is so glad 
		you can't think, and goes away and tries to change some of the counters 
		for things he really wants, and he can't, so you nearly die of laughing, 
		though of course it would be really sad if it were wake-life. But I was 
		telling you about the ways to the Fourth House, and the third way is 
		full of lions, and a person might be afraid; only whenever one comes to 
		bite at you, there is a lovely lady who puts her hands in its mouth and 
		shuts it. So we went through quite safely, and I thought of Daniel in 
		the lions' den.</p>
		<p align="left">The Fourth House is the most wonderful of all I had ever 
		seen. It is the most heavenly blue mansion; it is built of beryl and 
		amethyst, and lapis lazuli and turquoise and sapphire. The centre of the 
		floor is a pool of purest aquamarine, and in it is water, only you can 
		see every drop as a separate crystal, and the blue tinge filtering 
		through the light. Above there hangs a calm yet mighty globe of deep 
		sapphirine blue. Round it there were nine mirrors, and there is a noise 
		that means when you understand it, &quot;Joy! Joy! Joy!&quot; There are violet 
		flames darting through the air, each one a little sob of happy love. One 
		began to see what the dream-world was really for at last; every time any 
		one kissed any one for real love, that was a little throb of violet 
		flame in this beautiful House in the Wake-World. And we bathed and swam 
		in the pool, and were so happy you can't think. But they said: &quot;Little 
		girl, you must pay for the entertainment.&quot; [I forgot to tell you there 
		was music like fountains make as they rise and fall, only of course much 
		more wonderful than that.] So I asked what I must pay, and they said: 
		&quot;You are now mistress of all these houses from the Fourth to the Ninth. 
		You have managed the Servants' Hall well enough since your marriage; now 
		you must manage the others, because till you do you can never go on to 
		the Third House.&quot; So I said: &quot;It seems to me that they are all in 
		perfectly good order.&quot; But they took me up in the air, and then I saw 
		that the outsides were horribly disfigured with great advertisements, 
		and every single house had written all over it:</p>
		<p align="center">FIRST HOUSE</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>This is his Majesty's favourite Residence.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>No other genuine. Beware of worthless imitations.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Come in HERE and spend life!</p>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Come in HERE and see the Serpent eat his Tail!</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">So I was furious, as you may imagine, and had men go and 
		put all the proper numbers on them, and a little sarcastic remark to 
		make them ashamed; so they read:</p>
		<p align="left">Fifth House, and mostly dream at that.</p>
		<p align="left">Seventh House. External splendour and internal 
		corruption. and so on. And on each one I put &quot;No thoroughfare from here 
		to the First House. The only way is out of doors. By order.&quot;</p>
		<p align="left">This was frightfully annoying, because in the old days 
		we could walk about inside everywhere, and not get wet if it rained, but 
		nowadays there isn't any way from the Fourth to the Third House. You 
		could go of course by chariot from the Fifth to the Third, or go through 
		the House where the twins live from the Sixth to the Third, but that 
		isn't allowed unless you have been to the Fourth House too, and go from 
		there at the same time.</p>
		<p align="left">It was here they told me what T.A.R.O. on the ring 
		meant. First it means gate, and it is the name of my Fairy Prince, when 
		you spell it in full letter by letter.</p>
		<p align="left">There are seventy-eight parts to it, which makes a 
		perfect plan of the whole Palace, so you can always find your way, if 
		you remember to say T.A.R.O.. Then you remember I.N.R.I. is short for 
		L.V.X., which means the brilliance of the wide-wake Light, and that too 
		is the name of my Fairy Prince only spelt short.</p>
		<p align="left">The Romans said it had sixty-five parts, which is five 
		times thirteen, and seventy-eight is six times thirteen. To get into the 
		Wake World you must know your thirteen times table quite well. So if you 
		take them both together that makes eleven times thirteen, and then you 
		say &quot;Abrahadabra,&quot; which is a most mysterious word, because it has 
		eleven letters in it. You remember the Houses are numbered both ways, so 
		that the Third House is called the Eighth House too, and the Fifth the 
		Sixth, and so on. But you can't tell what lovely things that means till 
		you've been through them all, and got to the very end. So when you look 
		at the Ring and see I.N.R.I. and T.A.R.O. on it that means that it is 
		like a policeman keeping on saying &quot;Pass along, please!&quot; I would have 
		liked to stay in the Fourth House all my life, but I began to see it was 
		just a little dream House too; and I couldn't rest, because my own House 
		was the very next one. But it's too awful to tell you how to get there. 
		You want the most fearful lot of courage, and there's nobody to help 
		you, nobody at all, and there's no proper passage. But it's frightfully 
		exciting, and you must wait till next time before I tell you how I 
		started on that horrible journey, and if I ever got there or not.</td>

		<p></font>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="center">PART IV</p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Now I shall tell you about the chariot race in the first 
		passage. The chariot is all carved out of pure, clear amber, so that 
		electric sparks fly about as the furs rub it. The whole cushions and 
		rugs are all beautiful soft ermine fur. There is a canopy of bright blue 
		with stars (like the sky in the dream world), and the chariot is drawn 
		by two sphinxes, one black and one white. The charioteer is a most 
		curious person; he is a great big crab in the most glittering armour, 
		and he can just drive! His name is the mysterious name I told you about 
		with the eleven letters, but we call him Jehu for short, because he's 
		only nineteen years old. It's important to know though because this 
		journey is the most difficult of all, and without the chariot one could 
		never do it, because it is so far - much farther than the heaven is from 
		the dream world.</p>
		<p align="left">The passage where the twins live is very difficult too. 
		They are two sisters; and one is very pure and good, and the other is a 
		horrid fast woman. But that shows you how silly the dream language is - 
		really there is another way to put it: you can say there are two 
		sisters, and one is very silly and ignorant, and the other has learnt 
		how to know and enjoy.</p>
		<p align="left">Now when one is a Princess it is very important to have 
		good manners, so you have to go into the passage, and take one on each 
		arm, and go through with them singing and dancing; and if you hurt the 
		feelings of either of them the least little bit in the world it would 
		show that you were not really a great lady, only a dress lady, and there 
		is a man with a bow and arrow in the air, and he would soon finish you, 
		and you would never get to the Third House at all.</p>
		<p align="left">But the real serious difficulty is the outdoors. You 
		have to leave the House of Love, as they call the Fourth House. You are 
		quite, quite naked: you must take off your husband-clothes, and your 
		baby-clothes, and all your pleasure clothes, and your skin, and your 
		flesh, and your bones, every one of them must come right off. And then 
		you must take off your feeling clothes; and then your idea clothes; and 
		then what we call your tendency clothes which you have always worn, and 
		which make you what you are. After that you take off your consciousness 
		clothes, which you have always thought were your very own self, and you 
		leap out into the cold abyss, and you can't think how lonely it is. 
		There isn't any light, or any path, or anything to catch hold of to help 
		you, and there is no Fairy Prince any more: you can' even hear his voice 
		calling you to come on. There's nothing to tell you which way to go, and 
		you feel the most horrible sensation of falling away from everything 
		that ever was. You've got no nothing at all; you don't know how awful it 
		all is. You would turn back if you could only stop falling; but luckily 
		you can't. So you fall and fall faster and faster; and I can't tell you 
		any more.</p>
		<p align="left">The Third House is called the House of Sorrow. They gave 
		me new clothes of the queerest kind, because one never thinks of them as 
		one's own clothes, but only as clothes. It is a House of utmost 
		Darkness. There is a pool of black solemn water in the shining obsidian, 
		and one is like a vast veiled figure of wonderful beauty brooding over 
		the sea; and by and by the Pains come upon one. I can't tell you 
		anything about the Pains. Only they are different from any other pains, 
		because they start from inside you, from a deeper, truer kind of you 
		than you ever knew. By and by you see a tremendous blaze of a new sun in 
		the Sixth House, and you are as glad as glad as glad; and there are 
		millions of trumpets blown, and voices crying: &quot;Hail to the Fairy 
		Prince!&quot; meaning the new one that you have had for your baby; and at 
		that moment you find you are living in the first Three Houses all at 
		once, for you feel the delight of your own dear Prince and his love; and 
		the old King stirs in his Silence in the First House, and thousands of 
		millions of blessings shoot out like rays of light, and everything is 
		all harmony and beauty below, and crowned above with the crown of twelve 
		stars, which is the only way you can put it into dream talk.</p>
		<p align="left">Now you see you don't need to struggle to go on any 
		more, because you know already that all the House is one Palace, and you 
		move about in your own wake world, just as is necessary. All the paths 
		up to the Second House are open - the path of the Heirophant with the 
		flaming star and the incense in the vast cathedral, and the path of the 
		Mighty Ruler, who governs everything with his orb and his crown and his 
		sceptre. There is the path of the Queen of Love, which is more beautiful 
		than anything, and along it my own dear lover passes to my bridal 
		chamber. Then there are the three way to the Holy House of the old King, 
		the way by which he is joined with the new Fairy Prince, where dwells a 
		moonlike virgin with an open book, and always, always reads beautiful 
		words therein, smiling mysteriously through her shining veil, woven of 
		sweet thoughts and pure kisses. And there is the way by which I always 
		go to the King, my Father, and that passage is built of thunder and 
		lightening; but there is a holy Magician named Hermes, who takes me 
		through so quickly that I arrive sometimes even at the very moment I 
		start. Last of all is the most mysterious passage of them all, and if 
		any of you saw it you would think there was a foolish man in it being 
		bitten by crocodiles and dogs, and carrying a sack with nothing of any 
		use at all in it. But really it is the man who meant to wake up, and did 
		wake up. So that is his House, he is the old King himself, and so are 
		you. So he wouldn't care what anyone thought he was.</p>
		<p align="left">Really all the passages to the first Three Houses are 
		very useful; all the dream-world and the half-dream world, and the 
		Wake-world are governed from those passages.</p>
		<p align="left">I began to see now how very unreal even the Wake-world 
		is, because there is just a little dream in it, and the right world is 
		the Wide-Wide-Wide-Wake-World. My lover calls me little Lola Wide-awake, 
		not Lola Daydream any more. But it is always Lola, because I am the Key 
		of Delights. I never told you about the first two houses, and really you 
		wouldn't understand. But the Second House is gray, because the light and 
		dark flash by so quick it's all blended into one; and in it lives my 
		lover, and that's all I care about.</p>
		<p align="left">The First House is so brilliant that you can't think; 
		and there, too, is my lover and I when we are one. You wouldn't 
		understand that either. And the last thing I shall say is that one 
		begins to see that there isn't really quite a Wide-Wide-Wide-Wake-World 
		till the Serpent outside has finished eating up his tail, and I don't 
		really and truly understand that myself. But it doesn't matter; what you 
		must all do first is to find the Fairy Prince to come and ride away with 
		you, so don't bother about the Serpent yet. That's all.</p>
