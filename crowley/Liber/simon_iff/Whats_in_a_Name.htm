What's in a 
Name?</h2></CENTER>

<CENTER><h3 class="heading">by Aleister 
Crowley</h3></CENTER>

<P>Simon Iff was a magician.&nbsp; A magician is a superstitious idiot.&nbsp; 
Therefore, Simon Iff, travelling to America, carried nothing but a convenient 
handbag.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; To carry more, said he, is to pretend that America 
is a long way away.&nbsp; This would be an insult to the ghost of Robert 
Stephenson, I do not mean Robert Louis Stevenson.&nbsp; It is not safe to 
insult ghosts.</P>

<P>Now there were certain people who believed that the madness of "Simple 
Simon" was as carefully calculated as a Table of Logarithms, and those of this 
creed who happened to be in New York, at the Cunard Pier, just as he crossed 
the gangway from the 'Mauretania', were rejoiced to observe that his absurd  
fear of ghosts had saved him from any similar emotion in the presence of the 
Custom House Officials!</P>

<P>"Through already?" cried his friend, Keynes Aloysius Wimble, of the 
"Literary Chyle", a native of Birmingham, England, and sometime of Nairobi 
and a very minor college at Oxford, but esteemed by Simon on account of his 
astonishing talent for ecclesiasticism, his profound knowledge of foreign 
tongues, his atrocious insolence of manner, and his overmastering determination 
to get to the bottom of everything that came his way.</P>

<P>"My dear man!" replied Simon heartily, "I am 'through' on one condition - 
that you do not ask me to spell it t-h-r-u."&nbsp; This was his first and 
only criticism of the American continent.&nbsp; Like Hamlet, (there cracked a 
noble spirit) the rest is silence.&nbsp; "This way, then," cried Wimble, "this 
way for my tin Lizzie."&nbsp; Thus unassumingly did he refer to his tremendous 
roadster.&nbsp; The journalist was a Power in America.&nbsp; Without the 
'Chyle' no one would have known what not to read.&nbsp; As nobody would have 
read anything, in any case, the value of the publication was universally 
agreed to be immense.&nbsp; Its circulation was beyond anything ever 
discovered by Harvey, and it paid its editors almost as well as if they were 
man-milliners or cooks.</P>

<P>"Thought I'd drive you to the cottage," said Wimble.&nbsp; "Lizzie's been 
eating her head off all the week.&nbsp; Besides, we have to pay a visit of 
condolence.&nbsp; Our local Saint has lost his wife in the most distressing 
circumstances.&nbsp; It appears that she took Bichloride of Mercury in mistake 
for Aspirin."</P>

<P>"Ah! the Chemist's Boy in Pickwick!"</P>

<P>"Don't joke!&nbsp; The old boy's the best fellow alive, and he's utterly 
broken up over it."</P>

<P>"I thought 'local Saint' was sarcastic, perhaps."</P>

<P>"Not a scrap.&nbsp; He's not ostentatious about it; but he does good 
everywhere, and is beloved by everybody."</P>

<P>"Religious?"</P>

<P>"Intensely so.&nbsp; Has a bluff frank way with him that you and I might 
think irreverent; but it's better than cant and hypocrisy.&nbsp; He's very 
highly thought of in the Presbyterian Church."</P>

<P>"Ah! a Scot?"</P>

<P>"Name of Burns.&nbsp; Phineas Calvin Zebedee Burns."</P>

<P>"No, no!" cried Simon Iff, "I don't like that.&nbsp; The man certainly 
poisoned his wife!"</P>

<P>Wimble roared with laughter.&nbsp; "Dear old England!&nbsp; I used to feel 
that way myself; but eight years here have put me hep to all the bughouse 
monikers.&nbsp; (You may as well begin to learn the language.)&nbsp; Where a 
Member of the United States Senate, finding himself named Hogg, can call his 
daughters Ima and Ura respectively, there's nothing in a name!"</P>

<P>"I've heard that.&nbsp; It's a stupid joke, of course."</P>

<P>"No; it actually happened.&nbsp; There's no background.&nbsp; Anything can 
happen; anything.&nbsp; Anything!"</P>

<P>The car crossed the great Bridge, and gained new speed as the open country 
welcomed it.&nbsp; The day was frosty, and a black sky to Northward held snow 
in its shroud.&nbsp; The two friends fell to silence; then Wimble broke out 
into a passionate attack on the Belgians; for this was in 1911, before the 
year of the Great Enlightenment.&nbsp; He was not content to blame isolated 
officials for the atrocities of which his paper published weekly photographs; 
he proved that the fault lay in the inherent cruelty of the Belgian nature.&nbsp; 
He even blamed Cl&#233;o de M&#233;rode and Anna Robinson, thus casting a slur 
upon Charlemagne and George Washington.&nbsp; Simon Iff did not appear 
particularly interested.&nbsp; "When I was in the Congo," was his only remark, 
"I had boils.&nbsp; I ate standing for three weeks.&nbsp; Nobody sits down in 
the Congo!"</P>

<P>Presently the assailant of King Leopold desisted in favour of topographical 
information.&nbsp; "That," said he, pointing, "is the house of P. C. Z. 
Burns.&nbsp; Zee, not Zed, please!&nbsp; Inside and out, materially and 
spiritually, one of the best houses in the section."</P>

<P>"It is really quite delightful," said Iff, though he would probably at the 
moment have preferred a wattle hut in Annam.</P>

<P>"We shall lunch with Phineas, for it is two hours more to the cottage.&nbsp; 
He has a perfect cook.&nbsp; Pray for Squab Soup, and a Celery Cream Broil of 
Saddle Rocks!"</P>

<P>"I have too long omitted these items from the schedule of my daily 
supplications."</P>

<P>The car passed through magnificent wrought brass gates swung upon marble 
pillars, and entered a long avenue of trees.&nbsp; It was evident that love 
had made a paradise, not money alone.&nbsp; Simple Simon expressed his 
pleasure.</P>

<P>"Yet Burns lives a life of Spartan simplicity.&nbsp; Here at least, wealth 
has not corrupted Republican manners."</P>

<P>"Was that what I saw on the boat?" murmured the magician.</P>

<P>Wimble displayed the renegade's obstinacy.</P>

<P>"There's something fine and big about the frankess of these people; there 
are a few Anglophile snobs, but the real American is a man all through.&nbsp; 
And Burns is one of the best of them."</P>

<P>The man himself was pacing the terrace of the house when the car drew up 
before the door.&nbsp; His whole attitude denoted dejection, even agony; yet 
one could see that he had braced himself to meet his sorrow.&nbsp; "It is the 
Will of God" was written on the face that he lifted to see whose importunity 
disturbed his grief.&nbsp; By his side waddled a somewhat self-important little 
man, a chubby good-humored parson dressed in rusty black cloth, his face 
rubicund and plump, his attitude rather like that of Monsieur Rostand's 
chanticleer, who believes that he has just caused the sun to rise.&nbsp; His 
fingers gripping an oblong of dram paper.</P>

<P>"My dear Wimble," cried the little fellow, running forward as Iff and his 
host alighted, "you have arrived at the psychological moment!&nbsp; Our 
friend's munificence has surpassed itself; we are to have a Memorial 
Hospital.&nbsp; He has given me a check for a million dollars!"</P>

<P>"It is very touching," remarked Simon Iff.&nbsp; "It reminds me of the 
Sultan who built the Taj Mahal."</P>

<P>"I didn't know they had hospitals in Turkey," said the little minister.</P>

<P>"No?"&nbsp; said Simon Iff, politely.</P>

<P>Phineas Burns walked up, greeted Wimble with subdued warmth, and extended 
a hearty hand to Simon.&nbsp; The conversation became general for a few 
moments; presently the Presbyterian went away, hugging his check, and Burns 
asked them to be seated in the library.&nbsp; "I want you to stay over 
dinner," he said; "it is full two hours to our friend's cottage.&nbsp; And I 
should like you to meet my daughter.&nbsp; I am no physician for such grief 
as hers; I beg you to do all in your power to distract her thoughts from our 
bereavement."</P>

<P>Simon Iff liked even the word 'dinner' as applied to the midday meal; it 
smacked of that Republican simplicity which his chance companions on the 
Mauretania had somehow missed.</P>

<P>The door opened, and a slight girl came in.&nbsp; Her father was repeated 
in her.&nbsp; His tallness, his leanness, his narrow brow, his thin lips, 
his pale complexion, his solemnity, his nervous tension; all these were 
already marked in the child of fifteen years old.&nbsp; But what most struck 
the old mystic was the extreme misery in her eyes.&nbsp; Burns himself had 
none of that; rather was his eye moist, genial, and humourous.&nbsp; And Iff 
saw too that she moved as if under some most powerful constraint.&nbsp; So 
unpleasant was the impression that he was shocked into silence.&nbsp; Burns 
left the room, making an excuse about 'ten minutes with my secretary'; Wimble 
started an animated conversation with the girl, whose name was Claudine, and 
Iff never stirred.&nbsp; But his face darkened and darkened as the conversation 
went on.&nbsp; Only after some minutes did he seem to pull himself together.&nbsp; 
"I think we shall have snow soon.&nbsp; There is a heavy black sky to 
windward," he said, addressing himself pointedly to Claudine.&nbsp; "Don't you 
think so?"&nbsp; The girl hesitated.&nbsp; "I shouldn't be at all surprised," 
she answered at last.&nbsp; Simon Iff did not reply.&nbsp; He rose abruptly, 
clapping his hand to his forehead, and went out on to the terrace.&nbsp; 
Wimble was cynically amused.&nbsp; Was his old friend in 'love at first 
sight?'&nbsp; He had always had the reputation of an ultra-English aplomb - 
and here he was, violently agitated about absolutely nothing.&nbsp; However, 
he went on talking to Claudine.</P>

<P>Iff, on the terrace, was literally kicking his way from nowhere to 
nowhere.&nbsp; A lank gentleman with a little black bag came up to him.&nbsp; 
"Excuse me, Sir," he said, "can I do anything for you?&nbsp; I'm a doctor, and 
you look to me in pretty bad shape nervously."</P>

<P>"Nerves still holding out," replied Iff grimly.&nbsp; "I only landed this 
morning.&nbsp; But you can help me - if you were in attendance on the late 
Mrs. Burns.&nbsp; You were?"</P>

<P>"Surely."</P>

<P>"She died of Mercury Bichloride poisoning?"</P>

<P>"Surely."</P>

<P>"Where did it come from?"</P>

<P>The doctor was silent.&nbsp; "I ask," pursued Simon Iff, "because, in 
England, don't you know, Bichloride of Mercury doesn't grow on bushes."&nbsp; 
He had been warned that he would be expected to say "don't you know" as often 
as possible, and was trying to behave.</P>

<P>"I never thought to inquire," replied the doctor at last.</P>

<P>"Do you mind if I put that down in my notebook?" said Simon joyfully.&nbsp; 
"It's a wonderful phrase.&nbsp; It explains the world as nothing else does.&nbsp; 
'I never thought to inquire.'&nbsp; Columbus did, don't you know?&nbsp; Which 
shows that there are two sides to every question."&nbsp; The doctor thought 
that the old man was decidedly in need of his skill.</P>

<P>"You never prescribed Mercury for any one in the house?"</P>

<P>"Certainly not."</P>

<P>"Ah!"</P>

<P>"What are you suggesting?"</P>

<P>"Nothing.&nbsp; I was waiting for you."</P>

<P>"Well, good morning."</P>

<P>"Good morning."</P>

<P>Simon Iff drifted back to the library, and gazed blankly at the books.&nbsp; 
There was a wilderness of theology, a sobriety of 'classical' English and 
American novelists, nothing modern.&nbsp; At the end of the shelves was a 
strongroom door, and the old man looked upon it with a wistful eye.</P>

<P>"Where is your father's place of business?" he asked Claudine.</P>

<P>"Wall and Vine," she said, after a pause.</P>

<P>"He must be a very busy man to make so much money?"</P>

<P>Another pause.&nbsp; "Oh yes!"</P>

<P>"I hope he never brings his business home?"&nbsp; Still hesitation from 
Caludine.&nbsp; "Oh yes! he has an office at the other end of the house, 
where he works at night, sometimes."</P>

<P>"I think we shall have snow."</P>

<P>Wimble was thoroughly irritated by Iff's imbecility, and might have said 
something but for the return of Burns, who took them to the dining-room.</P>

<P>The conversation took the subdued turn natural to a house of mourning.&nbsp; 
Once the bereaved husband spoke in low tones of his dead wife's goodness.&nbsp; 
He hardly touched his soup.&nbsp; The second course was a planked shad.&nbsp; 
Wimble in a few well-chosen phrases introduced this remarkably excellent fish, 
and instanced its delicacy of flavour as an example of the effeteness of 
Europe.&nbsp; As it happened, however, the shad was abominably cooked.&nbsp; 
It was impossible to avoid remark.&nbsp; "Mary was so beloved by all," 
explained the host; "nothing has gone right in the house since she passed 
over."&nbsp; Simon Iff hated people "passing over" or "being taken from us" 
when they had merely died, for he hated every kind of camouflage.&nbsp; He 
observed his host narrowly.&nbsp; It struck him that his words were entirely 
false.&nbsp; Unless his whole power of psychology were at fault, the man was 
boiling over with impotent anger.&nbsp; It was quite incommensurable emotion, 
out of all relation with any visible circumstance.</P>

<P>"I understand, Mr. Burns," he said slowly, "that the servant problem is 
very acute in America."</P>

<P>He kept the conversation to this subject throughout lunch, to the despair 
of Wimble, who tried again and again to change the topic.&nbsp; The victory 
was Iff's, and he crowned it by inducing their host to suggest a visit 
through the kitchens, to inspect the labour-saving devices in use in 
America.</P>

<P>Simon Iff thought that mechanical perfection might have been more 
fortunately attained had the cost in morale been less severe.&nbsp; The cook 
was a quadroon woman of thirty, muscular, high bosomed, with a strong, even a 
domineering face.&nbsp; Her sensual mouth and arrogant eyes told of selfish 
passions never restrained.&nbsp; She made her independence felt, even to the 
strangers.&nbsp; In Europe her manner would have been called self-assertive; 
Wimble whispered to Iff that the price of liberty was eternal vigilance.&nbsp; 
"Yes," said Iff, "but 'Halt, friend, and give the countersign' becomes a 
little wearing after a while.&nbsp; I think I'll consult that doctor, after 
all."</P>

<P>"We can do that," said Wimble laughingly, "on our way to the cottage."</P>

<P>Once in the automobile and well away from the house, Iff sat up and began 
to take notice.&nbsp; "Do me a favour, Wimble," he said.&nbsp; "Let me dine 
in the city.&nbsp; I want to spend half an hour there first of all with a new 
and unexpected but I trust much-to-be-valued friend."</P>

<P>"Why, what's the big idea?"</P>

<P>"I want to chat with the Commissioner of Police."</P>

<P>"Wha-a-at?"</P>

<P>"About this murder, you know."</P>

<P>"Murder?"</P>

<P>"Mrs. Burns."</P>

<P>"Good-night!"</P>

<P>"Didn't you expect this?&nbsp; I had an idea that my fame had crossed the 
Atlantic."</P>

<P>"Yes, but I thought you were the real thing, not a Sunday Magazine 
Detective!"</P>

<P>"Come! you've seen all the people, and you know all the facts.&nbsp; Can't 
you put two and two together?"</P>

<P>"They only make four."</P>

<P>"Oh, this case has some very mysterious sides to it.&nbsp; For example, 
there are two things of unknown origin in it."</P>

<P>"As?"</P>

<P>"One:&nbsp; Bichloride of Mercury.&nbsp; The doctor couldn't suggest how 
that got into the house."</P>

<P>"It might have come in fifty ways; it doesn't implicate anybody."</P>

<P>"Yes, but there's a thing that only came in one way, and implicates 
somebody very much."</P>

<P>"That's?"</P>

<P>"Claudine."</P>

<P>"She's the child of her parents, isn't she?"</P>

<P>"The name, I mean."</P>

<P>"Americans are always giving odd names to children.&nbsp; Why, we 
discussed that already."</P>

<P>"We did.&nbsp; Didn't it mean anything to you?&nbsp; 'Ima Hogg" and 'Ura 
Hogg':&nbsp; does that tell you nothing about the father?"</P>

<P>"Peculiar sense of humour."</P>

<P>"Precisely.&nbsp; Now then, what about Claudine?&nbsp; Any 'free 
association' about Claudine?"</P>

<P>"Why, Willy, of course.&nbsp; <I>Claudine en m&#233;nage, Claudine s'en 
va</I> - that's all, though, I think."</P>

<P>"Right.&nbsp; Willy, naughty French novels.&nbsp; Now then, that's a 
curious name for a stern Puritan father to give to his daughter, isn't it?"</P>

<P>"Possibly a relative of that name."</P>

<P>"Possibly.&nbsp; But how does that connect with an unexplained supply of 
Mercury?&nbsp; In your imagination, I mean."</P>

<P>"All this is the most far-fetched, fantastic stuff.&nbsp; Better argue 
frankly that Funny Ass sounds fishy!"&nbsp; Iff bore up under that foul 
blow.</P>

<P>"Consider Claudine herself.&nbsp; I say it's Wednesday, and she takes 
thought before admitting it.&nbsp; What does that mean?"</P>

<P>"Mannerism."</P>

<P>"Suppression resulting from years of brutal tyranny."</P>

<P>"Oh nonsense, she's a happy, care-free, charming child."</P>

<P>"It's as much as her life's worth to be anything else.&nbsp; Look at her 
eyes!"</P>

<P>"Rats!"</P>

<P>"Next, that shad."</P>

<P>"Well?&nbsp; Badly cooked - I suppose the cook - oh bunk!"</P>

<P>"On the contrary, bed, I hope, for me to-night.&nbsp; But did you observe 
that our philanthropic friend excused the cook on account of her desolation 
at 'poor Mary's' death - and that he was inwardly boiling?"</P>

<P>"I did.&nbsp; He was sensitive, no doubt, about the quality of his 
hospitality; but his good heart forbade him to blame any one."</P>

<P>"Wimble, you are a very young and very innocent child.&nbsp; I like you.&nbsp; 
Here is a harsh tyrannical type, a terrible fellow both in his business and in 
his home; but he daren't blame his cook when he had every right to do so.&nbsp; 
I can only explain that attitude by guilt and fear.&nbsp; You, on the 
contrary, are mother's darling."</P>

<P>"You are yourself a loveable character - especially if asleep."</P>

<P>"That however rarely occurs."</P>

<P>"Well, here's Headquarters."</P>

<P>The Commissioner was delighted to meet the famous Simon Iff.&nbsp; And 
what could he do for him?</P>

<P>Mr. Iff would like a photograph of Phineas Burns shown to every doctor of 
high reputation in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, with a query as to 
whether he had come for treatment; and if so, for what?</P>

<P>The Commissioner was amazed.&nbsp; "I shall have to ask for something more 
than that," he said slowly.&nbsp; "Very good," said Simon Iff.&nbsp; "I 
prefer a charge of murder in the first degree."</P>

<P>"On what grounds?" asked the Chief.</P>

<P>"Well, he called his daughter Claudine," said Simple Simon.</P>

<P>"English Law?" queried the Commissioner.</P>

<P>"There's more than that.&nbsp; He hides his feelings in the matter of 
planked shad, and Claudine hides her feelings in every matter, and the cook 
doesn't hide her feelings at all."</P>

<P>"You can't tell that to the Grand Jury."</P>

<P>"I know it.&nbsp; That's why I want the evidence of the doctor.&nbsp; Once 
I get that, I'll show you a little of our Thirty-Third Degree."</P>

<P>"Damn it, I'll do it for the fun of the thing!"</P>

<P>"That's all I do it for, don't you know?" Simon Iff remembered his manners 
just in time, and clinched the Commissioner's opinion that he had to do with 
a crazy Englishman.</P>

<P>A week later Simon Iff received the information that Phineas Burns was 
undoubtedly the Godfrey Smith who had been under the treatment of Dr. James 
Gregg Tardie of Philadelphia for ten years past.&nbsp; Dr. Tardie had 
prescribed the Bichloride of Mercury in small doses for months at a time.&nbsp; 
And would Mr. Iff favour the Commissioner with a visit?</P>

<P>Mr. Iff conferred the favour requested.&nbsp; "We found out some more 
while we were on the job," said the big man.&nbsp; "Burns has been leading 
Some Double Life all these years.&nbsp; 'Black' seems to be the bug in his 
dome.&nbsp; You've given me confidence, I'll admit; but it's still a long way 
to that Grand Jury and the little arm-chair with the pep."</P>

<P>"Oh, no!" said Simon.&nbsp; "It's as easy as falling off a log.&nbsp; Leave 
it," he added with an embarrassed blush, "leave it to your Uncle Dudley."&nbsp; 
And then he added "don't you know?" in a spasm of modest confusion.</P>

<P>"Surely."</P>

<P>Iff decided that he had passed the test.</P>

<P>"But what exactly do you propose to do?"</P>

<P>"Just put it to him nicely and simply, don't you know?"</P>

<P>"I do not.&nbsp; But, 'don't you know,' he's liable to throw you out."</P>

<P>"Yes, I would like to have you come down with me.&nbsp; I think if you 
were there he'd listen quietly because he wouldn't quite know what your 
presence implied.&nbsp; My knowing the name of Tardie will be another little 
scare.&nbsp; But all I need is that he should listen; and he'll listen - if 
only just to call my bluff!"</P>

<P>"And you're only nine high!"</P>

<P>"The number nine, according to the Pythagoreans, is sacred, and attains 
the summits of philosophy."</P>

<P>"Very good.&nbsp; I certainly want to sit in to the game."</P>

<P>They went down to Burns' house, and found him alone.&nbsp; He greeted the 
Commissioner with just the proper feeling.&nbsp; Iff asked for a special 
interview 'on important business', and came straight to the point.</P>

<P>"I want to say my say," he began, "before my friend here says his.&nbsp; 
I have only one remark to make, which is this:&nbsp; The wages of sin is 
death."</P>

<P>Burns smiled, and lighted a cigar.&nbsp; This fanatic amused him.&nbsp; 
But he restrained an early impulse to answer anything.</P>

<P>"Whatsoever a man soweth," went on the mystic, "that shall he also reap.&nbsp; 
He that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.&nbsp; Doctor 
Tardie tells me ..."</P>

<P>Simon Iff broke off as he saw that Burns had let his cigar go out.&nbsp; 
He waited for him to relight it.&nbsp; The Commissioner noticed how great an 
effort it cost him.</P>

<P>Iff did not have to lie; he switched off from an indicative to an 
apodeictic proposition.&nbsp; "A man of your nervous tension is particularly 
liable to end with locomotor ataxia, general paralysis of the insane, or 
softening of the brain."</P>

<P>Burns took no second chance with his cigar, he puffed vigorously.</P>

<P>"It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.&nbsp; You indulge in 
secret your desire toward an inferior race, as you deem it - and you end by 
finding yourself in the power of your own cook."</P>

<P>Burns smoked more easily.&nbsp; A slight smile touched his lips.&nbsp; But 
Simon Iff was watching his eyes; there was no smile in them.</P>

<P>"He that, being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be 
destroyed, and that without remedy."</P>

<P>Simon Iff shut his mouth like the snapping of a trap.</P>

<P>Burns, unmoved, smoked his cigar steadily to the end.&nbsp; Then he crushed 
the fire of the butt upon a silver ashtray.&nbsp; Then he went to the door of 
the strongroom and opened it.&nbsp; From a drawer he took a heavy revolver, 
and deliberately blew away the top of his skull.</P>

<P>The Commissioner was on his feet, gasping.&nbsp; A second glance assured 
him that the man was dead.&nbsp; He turned upon Iff with a mixture of awe and 
horror.</P>

<P>The mystic, in his turn, had drawn a long black cigar from his case, and 
was lighting it with a hand that did not tremble in the least.</P>

<P>"My dear man!" was all the Commissioner could say.</P>

<P>"You want to know, of course?&nbsp; Come here!"</P>

<P>The magician stepped across the body, and opened one of the drawers in the 
strongroom at random.&nbsp; It was full of photographs.&nbsp; "Pah!" cried 
Teake in disgust.&nbsp; "Observe!" said Simon, returning to his easy chair.&nbsp; 
"When I came here I had no idea at all that the death of Mrs. Burns was 
anything beyond the accident it appeared.&nbsp; But the moment Claudine 
stepped into the room I understood from her manner that she had been bullied 
secretly and subtly until she was afraid to express herself in the simplest 
matter without thought, earnest thought, as to whether it might not get her 
into trouble.&nbsp; Yet a mask was always put upon the truth; she and her 
mother were always obliged to exhibit a 'happy home', an 'ideal American 
family life'.&nbsp; I began to understand the hard brutality of the man from 
that as well as from his success in business.&nbsp; I know also that he had 
expressed his own vices in the naming of his daughter after an immoral 
woman.&nbsp; Of course he would not have dared to use any name which the 
general public would have connected with lasciviousness, such as Cleopatra.&nbsp; 
He chose a name to which not one American in a million would attach any 
significance whatever.&nbsp; Returning to the mother, then what must her life 
have been with such a man?&nbsp; I began to suspect suicide rather than 
accident.&nbsp; So I asked the family doctor whence the Mercury had come.&nbsp; 
He could not tell me.&nbsp; 'Claudine' gave me a clue.</P>

<P>"Before I could go further, lunch arrived.&nbsp; I found this hard brutal 
cynical sensual man, annoyed at his cook's blunders, making excuses for 
her.&nbsp; Fear, I thought!&nbsp; What else could explain the situation?&nbsp; 
So I contrived to see the cook, and found an ambitious and intriguing woman, 
a woman of almost a male quality of lust, grasping at power like Browning's 
John the Pannonian.&nbsp; Then I perceived what influence might have forced 
him, with the Mercury ready to his hand, to murder.&nbsp; Oh, a safe 
murder!&nbsp; Who would suspect him of having such a drug?&nbsp; Who would 
guess, when he had been so careful as to go to Philadelphia to consult a 
physician under an assumed name?&nbsp; Even were the Mercury traced to him, 
still an accident!&nbsp; 'Poor woman, she took my tablets in mistake for 
hers!'"</P>

<P>"Yes,yes!" said the Commissioner, "I follow.&nbsp; I understood your train 
of reason before we came here.&nbsp; But how in God's name" - he crossed 
himself - "did you come to suppose that the hardest-headed man in America 
would fall for all that stuff from the Bible?&nbsp; Man, it isn't common 
sense!"</P>

<P>Simple Simon smiled with wide-open, childish eyes.&nbsp; "But, my dear 
Commissioner, think of his name!&nbsp; Phineas Calvin Zebedee!&nbsp; Don't 
you know who Phineas was?&nbsp; He 'stood for the Lord' when all Israel 'went 
an-whoring after Moab' or something.&nbsp; And Zebedee, the father of James 
and John, the 'Sons of Thunder.'&nbsp; There's your religious atmosphere!&nbsp; 
And Calvin!&nbsp; Why, the boy sucked in Calvin with his mother's milk.&nbsp; 
He was born and bred to that one great idea of inexorable fate.&nbsp; Though 
the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small, and all that, 
don't you know?&nbsp; On the top of that, too, what do we know of the father 
who named him?&nbsp; A narrow bigot, who repressed his son's normal instincts, 
and named him after a tyrant like himself, but with a passionate revolt 
against enforced chastity seeping at the very base of his nervous sytem!&nbsp; 
Well, the lust side of him was the art side too; he naturally dramatized the 
fate that his other side assured him must one day fall upon him, and he saw 
that fate in my person when I quietly reminded him of what penalties he had 
incurred."</P>

<P>The commissioner sat awhile in silence.&nbsp; Suddenly he shook himself 
like a dog.&nbsp; "I suppose I'd better get after that cook," he said, 
mechanically.</P>

<P>"Spare yourself the pains and the humiliation," said Simon.&nbsp; "He will 
have left her every penny - you don't have one chance in a million."</P>

<P>"True; but can't we do something for Claudine?"</P>

<P>"We can get back to New York, and dine at the Club.&nbsp; Claudine will be 
either a courtesan or a nun, and we can't help in either case."</P>

<P>"We can get back to new York; in fact I must; but somehow I don't feel 
like dinner."</P>

<P>And so it came about that Simon Iff dined that night with Wimble; but the 
only explanation that he would give was most unsatisfactory.</P>

<P>"It's my idiotic vanity, child!" he said, with his eighth creme de cacao; 
"I said to you jokingly that a man with a name like that was bound to have 
poisoned his wife, and so of course I had to prove it.&nbsp; I think I will 
have another Corona Corona."</P>

<P>Wimble, who always pretended to be excessively mean, pretended to writhe; 
but the waiter brought the cigar.</P>
