Suffer the Little 
Children</h2></CENTER>

<P>If Miss Mollie Madison supposed for one moment that Simon Iff meant to take 
his two week's Penance lightly, she was very much enlightened on arrival at 
Ormond, where, and not to Palm Beach, Mrs. Mills had taken the malingering 
Agnes.</P>

<P>He had bought a tremendous black stallion, 17 hands high, and every other 
morning went for a fifty-mile gallop along the broad smooth sands.&nbsp; 
Alternate mornings he would swim from dawn to noon.&nbsp; His lunch invariably 
consisted of grape-fruit and a big rare beef-steak, washed down with a bottle 
of plain spring water.&nbsp; He did not smoke any more.&nbsp; From one o'clock 
till sunset he might have been found in a palm-grove, deep hidden, sitting 
absolutely motionless with his legs tucked away under him.</P>

<P>At seven he joined the party for dinner, when he ate fish and drank a quart 
of milk.&nbsp; Immediately after the meal he walked swiftly to the beach and 
back, usually with Mollie or Agnes or both, and then retired to sleep.&nbsp; 
At midnight he awoke, and continued his meditation until dawn.</P>

<P>The good lady was exceedingly perturbed, after about a week, by the 
character of his conversation, which consisted in contradicting every 
statement made in his presence.&nbsp; If she said it was a fine day, he would 
reply, "Pardon me, madam, if I cannot admit that it is fine.&nbsp; At the same 
time, it is not wet, cold, windy, or anything else unpleasant."&nbsp; His 
explanation was that nothing that could be thought was true, in the highest 
philosophical sense; similarly, nothing that could be throught was not true, 
so that his only chance of telling the truth was to deny everything, and its 
contradiction also, whenever opportunity arose.</P>

<P>Mrs. Mills was very grateful to him for saving her fortune, and she thought 
that the least she could do to repay him was to have a doctor to look at 
him.&nbsp; She knew that he would never consent to a consultation, so she 
quietly asked a famous nerve specialist from New York, who spent his winters 
in Florida, making a fortune out of patching up the idle rich, to come to 
dinner, and have an unoffical look at him.</P>

<P>Dr. Buzzard was a very clever man, and knew enough never to tell a patient 
that there was nothing the matter with him; so he reported to Mrs. Mills 
that he couldn't quite say that it was paranoia, that to call it neuraesthenia 
might be premature, that dementia praecox, while worthy of our earnest 
consideration, was not actually to be considered as definitively established 
at present, and that while there were or might be or seem to be decided 
symptoms of a medenologicolalic type, it could hardly be maintained 
diagnostically that psychopathological caehexia, in any of its commoner forms, 
at least, was inhibiting the nous, almost as non-committally as Iff himself 
could have wished.</P>

<P>However, a second dinner party might enable him to endeavour to draw out 
Mr. Iff.&nbsp; If he could be got to take interest once more in the common 
things of life, the mind might take on a healthier tone.</P>

<P>The wind was somewhat taken out of his sails by the appearance of Simon 
Iff at dinner in full evening dress.&nbsp; He had ordered the meal, 
moreover:&nbsp; oysters, clear green turtle, pompano en papillote, mallard 
duck au sang with coeur de palmier salad, bavaroise au chocolat, and a savoury 
invented by himself consisting of Toast Melba spread with mushrooms, 
anchovies, olives and pimento made into a paste.&nbsp; This was covered with 
bay-leaves, on which was spread a mixture of caviar, raw onions, ginseng, and 
Bombay Duck, sprinkled lightly with powdered hashish.</P>

<P>The wine list was equally elaborate.&nbsp; Cocktails consisting of two 
teasepoonfuls of liqueur brandy, one of Curacoa, and one of laudanum preceded 
the repast.&nbsp; With the oysters he caused Chablis to be served, with the 
soup Tokay, with the fish Chateau Yquem.&nbsp; The duck was accompanied by 
Mumm Cordon Rouge 1904.&nbsp; The sweet was enriched by a marvelous sauce 
with a basis of Creme de Cacao, and the savoury fortified with an 
astonishingly fine Burgundy of incomparable body and bouquet.&nbsp; The 
coffee was Turkish, prepared by Simon himself at the table, and perfected by 
the addition of an aromatic consisting of essential oil of cedar-wood and 
ambergris.</P>

<P>The liqueurs were Green Chartreuse of the original shipping, a particular 
Absinthe from a private still belonging to a friend of Simon Iff living in 
Switzerland among the crags of Jura, and an <I>introuvable</I> Metternich 
brandy.&nbsp; With the nuts came Ch&#226;teau Margaux, Port, and a Madeira 
dating from William the Fourth.</P>

<P>An unopened bottle of rye whisky was also placed prominently on the 
table.&nbsp; There must be a skeleton, said Simon Iff, at every banquet.</P>

<P>For he had begun to do the honours by announcing that this was His Night 
Off.&nbsp; "Am I," he asked indignantly, "of no more value than many 
housemaids?"</P>

<P>"A lucid interval," thought Dr. Buzzard, acutely.&nbsp; "Let me improve 
the occasion!"&nbsp; Towards the finale of the duck <I>rondo</I>, therefore, 
he expressed a wish that Mr. Iff could be induced to apply his truly 
marvellous powers to the discovery of the Crime of Titusville.</P>

<P>"Useless," rejoined Simon, "I have already discovered it."</P>

<P>"Why, what is the Crime of Titusville?" mooed Mrs. Mills.</P>

<P>"Titusville," replied Iff, with finality.</P>

<P>"He's off again," thought the doctor to himself, having no sense of 
humour.</P>

<P>"I rode over there the other day," explained the mystic, "it is the worst 
of crimes - a crime against Nature."&nbsp; And he began to sing softly.</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"What though 
the spicy breezes<BR>
Blow soft o're Titusville,<BR>
Though every prospect pleases,<BR>
The people make me ill."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>"Do they 'Bow down to wood and stone'?" laughed Miss Mollie Madison, who 
had up to that moment attended strictly to the business of dinner.&nbsp; She 
had been copying The Master's asceticism with feminine fidelity, and now meant 
to make up for it.</P>

<P>"They do," said Iff.</P>

<P>"But surely they are Christians?" tittered Mrs. Mills, with surprise.</P>

<P>"They are," crashed the magician.&nbsp; "They worship Wood in the Head, 
and Stone in the Heart."</P>

<P>"Oh dear!" faded away the good matron, wondering whether she had not 
perhaps drunk a little too much.</P> 

<P>Dr. Buzzard determined to put forth a great effort to prevent his 
prospective patient from slipping back.</P>

<P>"Yesterday morning," he said thickly but firmly, "the little daughter of 
Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe, who live some fifteen miles out of Titusville, on the St. 
John River, disappeared.&nbsp; And she has not been found."</P>

<P>"Tell me the facts," said the magician, suddenly serious.</P>

<P>"Thorpe's grove is ten miles from the next inhabited dwelling.&nbsp; He 
employs several men to work for him, but they were all with him in the grove 
during the period of which we are to speak.&nbsp; Thorpe is a bluff bearded 
fellow of fifty or so; his wife Birdie is not yet thirty.&nbsp; They are 
intensely religious, devoted to I don't know quite which of the warring sects 
of Baptist.&nbsp; The grove is a large and flourishing concern; Thorpe has 
plenty of money in the bank, and owns real estate in Titusville to a 
considerable value.&nbsp; A rich man for these parts, you may say.</P>

<P>"Mamie, the only child, is not yet five years old.</P>

<P>"The house stands on the east bank of the river; access from the west is 
almost impossible; the stream is shallow, a mere trickle over thick banks of 
soft mud; it flows through many and changing channels; the swamp extends for 
many miles.</P>

<P>"A rough track leads through thick jungle to the grove; thence it becomes 
a little wider and smoother as it winds towards Titusville.&nbsp; The point to 
notice is that it would be difficult for any person to reach the house without 
being seen by the men at work in the grove.&nbsp; It would be easy for him, 
however, to hide in the jungle all night, and get away the following day after 
sundown when the men returned from labour.</P>

<P>"I must tell you that Mrs. Thorpe was previously married to a man named 
Spring.&nbsp; There was a daughter; but the Thorpes are reticent on the 
subject.&nbsp; After Spring's death Birdie was courted by several men, notably 
by one James Harper, a man of twenty-five, of good prospects and religious 
character."</P>

<P>"But Thorpe had better prospects and was more religious."</P>

<P>"I think that was the case.&nbsp; Anyhow, she married Thorpe.&nbsp; Harper 
vowed vengeance; in particular he threatened that if she ever had a child he 
would kidnap it.&nbsp; He then went away and started a ranch in Texas.&nbsp; 
Here his character degenerated; he openly denied religion, and took to 
drinking."</P>

<P>"Dreadful," said Simon, motioning the wine steward to refill the doctor's 
glass.</P>

<P>"However, he seems to have made himself universally liked as a good 
fellow.&nbsp; But he never would look at a woman.&nbsp; His heartiness appears 
to have been assumed for the benefit of his friends; when alone, he was 
morose.&nbsp; He was often found in his cottage with his head sunk upon the 
table, and the caller, greeted with a shout and a laugh, would yet perceive 
that he had been crying bitterly.</P>

<P>"Yesterday morning Mrs. Thorpe was hanging out the washing.&nbsp; Mamie was 
playing in front of the house.&nbsp; She was last seen by her mother trying 
to climb a cumquat tree of unusual size to reach the fruit upon the upper 
branches.</P>

<P>"A few minutes later - naturally the poor woman cannot be sure of the exact 
period - the child had disappeared.&nbsp; She called out, and then went on 
with her work.&nbsp; Then again she noticed that Mamie had not answered the 
call.&nbsp; She became anxious and went after her.</P>

<P>"The child's footsteps were plain to follow.&nbsp; They led along the track 
for a little way, and then turned off into the jungle.&nbsp; A strip of torn 
cotton was found at this point.</P>

<P>"The footsteps vanished.&nbsp; Mrs. Thorpe, now thoroughly alarmed, ran 
back to the house and fired the shotgun which was the signal for the men to 
come in to dinner.&nbsp; She searched around the house, the swamp, the river 
banks, while waiting, and found no trace.&nbsp; Thorpe ran in from the grove, 
surprised at the untimely summons.&nbsp; She told her story.&nbsp; Thorpe 
fired again to call in the men.&nbsp; Together, they verified the evidence of 
the trail.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to beat the jungle.&nbsp; Thorpe 
sent a man on horseback to Titusville to get assistance.&nbsp; The whole town 
turned out, and arrived on the spot by noon.&nbsp; The disappearance had taken 
place, roughly, at seven in the morning.</P>

<P>"The sheriff of Titusville is a fine fellow, and a very hot man on a 
trail.&nbsp; He verified the evidence once more, and entirely agreed with the 
previous indications.&nbsp; As luck would have it, I was passing through 
Titusville in my car, noticed the commotion, and offered him a lift.&nbsp; We 
arrived well ahead of the rest of the town.&nbsp; So, you see, I have my 
knowledge at first hand."</P>

<P>"Excellent.&nbsp; Well, what did you discover?"</P>

<P>"A man's footprints, wide apart and softly impressed, leading from another 
part of the jungle, a quite different part, to the clearing about the 
house.&nbsp; They led to a knoll which overlooks the whole of the open space 
from the river to the jungle.&nbsp; He had stopped there, and shifted his 
feet about.&nbsp; Then he must have turned, and run like the wind.&nbsp; It 
was a series of wild leaps back to the jungle.&nbsp; He seems to have plunged 
head foremost into the thickest part of it.&nbsp; He did not choose an opening, 
but charged like a bull.&nbsp; Torn cloth and blood bore evident witness to 
the event.</P>

<P>"Sheriff Higgs and I followed with about a dozen men.&nbsp; The others were 
busy on the other side, hunting systematically from the place where the 
child's tracks ended.&nbsp; Ours was a terrible trail.&nbsp; Broken twigs and 
trampled grass made it easy to follow, save where the man in his fury had 
leapt across the ever-recurring pools, long snaky shiny stinking stagnations, 
which the sheriff, although a great athlete, did not dare to attempt.</P>

<P>"But the longest trail ends at last.&nbsp; About three o'clock we came upon 
Harper.&nbsp; He was lying half-in, half-out of a pool.&nbsp; He was stone 
dead.&nbsp; I examined him; the cause of death was evident, the rupture of a 
blood-vessel on the brain.</P>

<P>"There was nothing suggestive in his pockets, except an old worn photograph 
of Mrs. Thorpe with 'Ever thine Birdie' scrawled across it in a slow 
uneducated hand.&nbsp; There was not a shred of evidence to prove that he had 
ever had possession of the child, though of course he must have done so.&nbsp; 
And she has not been found anywhere else, either.&nbsp; Not a trace!"</P>

<P>"Not a button, or feather, or mark!" quoted Simon, and they stared at his 
levity.</P>

<P>"I don't think I will explain just now.&nbsp; By the way, doctor, just one 
question.&nbsp; Do Mrs. Thorpe's tracks anywhere cross Harper's?"</P>

<P>"Not within fifty yards."</P>

<P>"I will take a look round.&nbsp; My holiday ends at midnight, but I might 
as well ride that way as another, and I hereby, in the superior interests of 
humanity, absolve myself from my Vow of negation during my little 
pilgrimage."</P>

<P>Punctually at twelve o'clock he broke up the party, and went to his 
room.&nbsp; Five minutes later he was in his riding breeches, with a blue 
poncho, striped with white and purplish brown.&nbsp; The moon, rising at one 
o'clock, fell on his pale face as he cantered on the great black stallion 
towards Titusville.</P>

<P>Following the directions given him, he turned off the main road a little 
before dawn into a narrow track that wound between the groves.&nbsp; 
Presently he came to a bifurcation; a few minutes later, to another, more 
doubtful as to direction.&nbsp; In half an hour it petered out completely.&nbsp; 
He had lost his way.</P>

<P>He looked about him for signs of habitation.&nbsp; There were none.&nbsp; 
He decided to take the safest course, and return to a house some miles back, 
where he could refresh his orientation.</P>

<P>Just then, in the solemnity of dawn's silence, he heard a voice.&nbsp; Some 
one - some one within a few hundred yards of him - was singing.</P>

<P>The voice was untutored, but its range and its richness astounded him.&nbsp; 
There did not seem to be any words, and yet it was articulate.&nbsp; Higher it 
soared and higher, in trills and arpeggios, then fell as a cascade falls in 
luxurious cadences, then shrilled again.&nbsp; It was the wildest maddest 
music.</P>

<P>Some instinct prompted Simon Iff to play the spy.&nbsp; Perhaps it was that 
he did not want to disturb the singer, possibly to frighten her.&nbsp; So he 
slipped off his horse, and tied the bridle to a tree, then crept warily 
through the undergrowth.&nbsp; He had been a successful shikari in the 
Hambantota province of Ceylon, and cared nothing for any shooting but the 
stalk.&nbsp; Five or six minutes later he was in full view of the quarry.</P>

<P>He judged her to be of sixteen years of age.&nbsp; Her body was sinewy and 
agile, though rather short and sturdy.&nbsp; Her face had something of the 
satyr in it, with a double curve to strong voluptuous lips.&nbsp; The face was 
oval, with deep set violet eyes, and dark lines under them, the complexion 
otherwise absolutely pallid, a dead ivory.&nbsp; Her hair was long and loose, 
deep violet like her eyes, hanging in heavy masses that curled Medusa-wise 
about her head.&nbsp; She was clad only in a cotton shift, but her dress, a 
coarse brown merino, lay with her shoes and stockings a little distance behind 
her.</P>

<P>Hardly had he taken notice of these matters when her song stopped, and she 
began to dance.&nbsp; It was a savage romp, reminding him of certain Spanish 
girls at Granada.&nbsp; But this was a true witch-dance, done with the 
deliberate purpose of invocation.</P>

<P>She stopped suddenly, with curious na&#239;v&#233;t&#233;; sat down, and 
began to put on her dress.</P>

<P>The magician read her soul easily, for it was close kin to his own.&nbsp; 
He knew that there was but one way to approach her.&nbsp; He began in a very 
low deep voice, like the muttering of distant thunder, to chant the Hymn to 
Pan from the Ajax of Sophocles.</P>

<P>At first the girl did not hear; but as the magician grew louder and bolder 
and more dynamic, she rose and looked about her.&nbsp; Simple Simon was far 
too well hidden for such crude search.&nbsp; His voice soared and sank, roared 
and rolled in passionate ecstasy, like the beating of African drums.</P>

<P>Suddenly the girl fell upon her knees.&nbsp; She tore off her clothes, even 
the shift itself, closed her eyes, threw her head back, and extended her 
arms.</P>

<P>The magician ceased his song.&nbsp; He came forward quietly toward her, 
and caught her in his arms.&nbsp; A terrible shudder passed through her frame 
as he put his mouth on hers; she went limp, and he laid her upon the ground 
unconscious.&nbsp; Then he covered her with her own dress, and stood with 
folded arms, waiting.&nbsp; In a few minutes she came out of her swoon.&nbsp; 
As she saw Iff she trembled, and put her forearm over her eyes.&nbsp; The word 
"Pan" came in a whisper from her lips.</P>

<P>"Yes, child," said the magician very gently.&nbsp; "It is well, Syrinx, 
that you never 'ran into the forest from Arcadian Pan.'&nbsp; But I am not 
Pan only; I am one Simon Iff, 'a desperate magician concealed within the 
circle of this forest.'&nbsp; In that capacity, I am quite quiet and harmless, 
and I have lost my way.&nbsp; I will turn back while you dress, and then you 
will come with me to my horse and put me on my way.&nbsp; Also, I will put you 
on yours."</P>

<P>"My name is Alma," she said very coolly.&nbsp; "I am a witch."</P>

<P>"Glad to meet you," said Simon, "and glad to hear it.&nbsp; But don't try 
to bewitch me when I'm not looking.&nbsp; It's easier, anyhow, when I am!"</P>

<P>He turned his back.&nbsp; In two minutes he felt her arm slip through 
his.&nbsp; They went dancing together out of the hummocks.</P>

<P>"Oh, there's the Devil's black horse!"</P>

<P>"And me the Devil!"</P>

<P>"Of course you are.&nbsp; I belong to you, you know."</P>

<P>"Certainly, certainly."</P>

<P>"I sold my soul for an hour's happiness, and your voice told me that I 
should have it, and you would come to take me away in a year and a day.&nbsp; 
Oh how splendid of you to keep your word!&nbsp; The year and a day are up 
to-day!"</P>

<P>"But where am I to take you?"</P>

<P>"To hell, of course."</P>

<P>The magician regarded her with growing surprise.</P>

<P>"I've had my happiness," she said, "when you put your arms round me and 
kissed me.&nbsp; Don't you dare think I want to get out of the bargain!"</P>

<P>"So you are really willing to go to hell?"</P>

<P>"Of course I am."</P>

<P>Simon Iff considered her keenly for a few moments.</P>

<P>"The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman," he quoted at last, "Modo he's 
called, and Mahu.&nbsp; As a gentleman, I don't want to take unfair 
advantage.&nbsp; So would you mind telling me exactly what you mean by 
hell?"</P>

<P>"Why, the bottomless pit, of course.&nbsp; The lake of fire and brimstone 
that burneth for ever and ever, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not 
quenched, where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, and they 
gnaw their tongues for pain."</P>

<P>"I understand," said Simon Iff.&nbsp; "<I>That</I> place!"</P>

<P>"Don't you realize how much better that is than Titusville?&nbsp; I could 
be happy there, I think.&nbsp; There's a great gulf fixed, isn't there?&nbsp; 
No one could get across from heaven to torture me."</P>

<P>"So that was why you sold your soul?"</P>

<P>"I just had to be eternally lost.&nbsp; I was in horrible danger.&nbsp; 
They had baptized me in my infancy, by total immersion, not the other kinds 
that don't count; at any moment I might have died and gone to heaven, where 
mother is."</P>

<P>"I am afraid I shall have to talk seriously to you about theology.&nbsp; 
Did it never occur to you that some of your pastors and teachers might be 
liable to some slight inaccuracy at times?"</P>

<P>"Do you mean - it might not be all true?"</P>

<P>"I fear I do."</P>

<P>"But it is true, for I've sold my soul to you, and you've come to take me 
on the very day you said you would!"</P>

<P>"But I didn't promise to take you to hell, did I?"</P>

<P>"Not exactly.&nbsp; But where else could you take me?"</P>

<P>"Well, I rather thought I would send you over to Paris to some friends of 
mine who teach little girls to sing when they have voices like yours - only, 
they haven't.&nbsp; Yours happens to be the finest natural voice I've heard 
in forty years.&nbsp; And you've got the personality, and the temperament, and 
the religious feeling, and the dramatic power.&nbsp; When you are twenty-two 
you will be the greatest singer in the world."</P>

<P>"But I haven't a cent.&nbsp; Oh if only I could have got to Jacksonville, 
like Selma Spring!&nbsp; She went on the streets, you know, and now she's a 
dancer in a cabaret in New York.&nbsp; Tom Biddle told me."</P>

<P>"Spring!&nbsp; Spring!&nbsp; I know that name.&nbsp; Is that the girl whose 
mother married Thorpe?"</P>

<P>Alma nodded.</P>

<P>"So the plot thickens?&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; I smell battle," he murmured to 
himself.</P>

<P>"Well, let me extend my holiday awhile, and save the living before I go to 
take vengeance for the dead."</P>

<P>"And you can't get away?" he added aloud.&nbsp; "Ah, but you can when the 
Devil takes you."</P>

<P>"My father would catch me and drag me back."</P>

<P>"The only safe place is hell, you think?&nbsp; I'll show you that the Devil 
is Prince of this world.&nbsp; I'm sorry if you miss the brimstone, but I'll 
do all I can.&nbsp; Now up we get on the Demon Horse, and away!"</P>

<P>He lifted her lightly to the saddle.</P>

<P>"I have a friend at Ormond, a very charming girl named Mollie Madison.&nbsp; 
Let us get to some place where I can telephone, and this Young Lochinvar Act 
will go great at the first house.&nbsp; Direct me, Alma child, we mustn't run 
into people just now."</P>

<P>She knew the country perfectly.&nbsp; They never saw a soul until, near a 
cross-road, they came upon a hamlet which boasted a post-office.&nbsp; Iff 
left her with the horse in a little grove, well out of sight, and went forward 
to send his message.&nbsp; His excellent French was too much, he hoped, for 
any eavesdropping clerks.</P>

<P>An hour later Miss Mollie Madison arrived at the edge of the grove in 
Simon's big limousine.&nbsp; She had one of her own dresses ready for the 
girl, who was sitting at the feet of the magician, acquiring elementary 
instruction in the Art of Geomancy.&nbsp; The change was quickly made, toilet 
and all, for Mollie would have made a first class lady's maid had all else 
failed.&nbsp; Alma still looked a little like a satyr, but oh! a satyr in the 
very best society.</P>

<P>"Take her to Jacksonville in the car," commanded Simon.&nbsp; "There you 
can get the limited.&nbsp; Fix her up in New York with money and clothes and a 
story, and introduce her to plenty of nice people.&nbsp; Then leave her in 
charge of the apartment, and come back to finish the rest-cure."</P>

<P>"But I thought you were going to take me away yourself," pouted Alma.</P>

<P>"The fact is, dear child, I've a date to take somebody else away.&nbsp; And 
this time there's going to be the smell of brimstone, and a little over."</P>

<P>"You'll come for me soon, though?"</P>

<P>"If you're good - I mean bad - and stick to your singing!"</P>

<P>"Kiss me good-bye!"</P>

<P>Simon Iff took the child in his arms for a moment, and touched her lips.</P>

<P>"The Devil gives good measure," he said.&nbsp; "You bargained for an hour's 
happiness; you shall have a lifetime of it.&nbsp; And your soul's all your own 
for ever!"</P>

<P>He kissed her again, and put her into the car.&nbsp; Mollie put down the 
lever.&nbsp; They were off.</P>

<P>"Exit the Chorus," observed Simon, a trifle surly.&nbsp; "Now let us get to 
business!"</P>

<P>He made no mistake about his road on the second time of asking, and came to 
the house of the Thorpes a little before sundown.</P>

<P>Mrs. Thorpe was at the door, sweeping.&nbsp; He looked fully upon her.&nbsp; 
Not yet thirty-five!&nbsp; Her eyes seemed enormous because of the emaciation 
of her cheeks, sunken upon her toothless jaws.&nbsp; Her hair was scanty and 
turning grey over the temples.&nbsp; Her lean breasts sagged in her thin 
dress.&nbsp; She stooped as if with age.&nbsp; Her hands were coarse, dirty, 
like claws.&nbsp; Her thin long straight mouth was colourless, the lips 
pinched inwards.</P>

<P>She turned from her mechanical sweep, sweep of the worn broom, and looked 
up.&nbsp; The sun was setting angrily over the swamps, whose miasma turned 
his rays to a dull red.&nbsp; In that light Simon on his giant steed towered 
terrific and menacing.&nbsp; The foul crone fixed her eyes upon his face.&nbsp; 
It was convulsed by a Satanic sneer.</P>

<P>"Who are you?" she gasped, in a thin squeak.</P>

<P>His voice was hoarse and rasping and malignant.&nbsp; "I am the Devil, come 
to take his own."</P>

<P>"But I'm saved, I do assure you, I'm saved.&nbsp; I've been baptized, adult 
baptism by sprinkling, not the ways that aren't any good.&nbsp; I always go to 
chapel to Brother Teague's.&nbsp; I - I -"</P>

<P>Simon's frown had become more frightful than at first.&nbsp; "Oh, you can't 
take me, you can't take me!" she screamed.&nbsp; "I read the Bible 
everyday."</P>

<P>The magician gave a sardonic laugh, grating and hideous.</P>

<P>"Is that all?&nbsp; Come!"</P>

<P>"No, no, I'm not ready," wailed the hag, and, falling on her knees, began 
to call upon 'Jesus'.</P>

<P>It was an incoherent flood of blasphemies, had she known it.</P>

<P>Simon sat silent.&nbsp; Presently the prayer gave her some sort of courage, 
and became intelligible.</P>

<P>"Did I do wrong, Lord," she screamed, "oh don't tell me I did wrong to throw 
Mamie to the alligators, dear, dear Lord Jesus, don't say that!&nbsp; Didn't 
you say, Lord, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me?'&nbsp; I couldn't, 
I couldn't let her grow up like Selma to disgrace me!"</P>

<P>She began to babble again; when she looked up, the horseman had gone as 
silently as he had come.&nbsp; She had a great story to tell her husband of a 
miraculous answer to her prayer.</P>

<P>Simon Iff rode all through the night.&nbsp; He was chilled to the marrow; 
he rode like a dead man.&nbsp; Dawn found him near Ormond; the rising sun 
awoke him from his trance.&nbsp; The stallion gave a weak sigh.&nbsp; 
"Damnation!" cried Simon, "I've been a brute to my horse!"&nbsp; He 
dismounted, and led him to the stable.</P>

<P>He stumbled wearily up the steps to the verandah of the hotel.</P>

<P>As it chanced, Dr. Buzzard had been out early, and saw him.&nbsp; "Lord, 
that man wants a doctor!" he thought, and ran forward to assist him.</P>

<P>Simon sank wearily into a chair.&nbsp; All the virtue seemed to have gone 
out of him.&nbsp; Buzzard called the waiter to bring some brandy.&nbsp; Simon 
waved it aside.&nbsp; "I only drink brandy," he faltered, "when I'm feeling 
fiery and martial."&nbsp; He tried to smile.</P>

<P>"Damnation!" he roared suddenly, like a lion, "and I ought to be feeling 
fiery and martial, not moping like a dumb beast in agony.&nbsp; That's 
better.&nbsp; A damned good suggestion of yours, doctor, here's thanks - and  
jolly good luck to you and to all brave men that are out to fight 
ignorance!"&nbsp; He drained the liquor at a gulp.</P>

<P>"I'm good at finding excuses for a drink, you see," he laughed 
defiantly.&nbsp; There was a false note in his voice.&nbsp; To Buzzard it 
suggested the strained artificiality of a man in dreadful pain, striving with 
all his pride or courage to conceal the fact.</P>

<P>"But I <I>am</I> rather tired, now you don't mention it, and I think I'll 
go up and have a nap.&nbsp; Meet me at lunch, will you?&nbsp; I can a tale 
unfold 'whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood' 
- oh, you finish the quotation, it's all too ghastly apt!"</P>

<P>He left the doctor a little confirmed in the less optimistic aspects of his 
original diagnosis.</P>

<P>But at lunch he was his own jovial self once more, though he had gone back 
to grape-fruit and beef-steak and mineral water.</P>

<P>"Dr. Buzzard, you are a famous alienist.&nbsp; It is perhaps impertinent of 
me to offer you a clinical picture of what is called sanity in the back-blocks 
of America.&nbsp; But I have my object.</P>

<P>"Imagine yourself a woman born into a universe containing three 
sections.&nbsp; The first is a colourless place, described as joyful by people 
who have had no joy to colour their imaginations.&nbsp; The second is a place 
of dreadful, senseless agony, readily enough realized by those whose whole 
lives are full of pain.&nbsp; It is very much more real than the first, 
because both places are merely shadowy expansions to infinity of what they 
actually know.&nbsp; Eternal fire is much more suggestive than eternal - I 
won't call it music.</P>

<P>"The third place is a place of continual torment.&nbsp; Childhood is one 
long round of scoldings and punishments varied by threats of unknown 
terrors.&nbsp; Youth is an apprenticeship to slavery.&nbsp; Marriage means an 
increased dose of drudgery, with an annual agony of childbearing, more joyless 
and sordid than a sow's.&nbsp; All pleasures without exception are sins, and 
incur the penalty of going after death to the place which has been defined as 
the eternal and infinite exaggeration of all the known miseries of life.&nbsp; 
Oh strait is the gate and narrow is the way, when of the seventy-seven methods 
of baptism only one is efficacious, and the neighbours are as sure that their 
way is right as you are about yours!&nbsp; Life is a trackless abyss of pain 
and fear - above all, fear.</P>

<P>"Then remove all human society, even those naughty neighbours!&nbsp; Remove 
books!&nbsp; Remove music!&nbsp; Remove art!&nbsp; Remove even interest in 
politics, and the wide world!&nbsp; Leave such a woman for a while in an 
isolated house in a swamp, sick with malaria, acrid with mosquitoes, a 
year-long stench of putrefying weeds.&nbsp; Add a hot climate, with a summer of 
steaming rains.&nbsp; Can you, with all your educated imagination, picture 
a more abominable hell, physical, mental, moral, spiritual - can you?"</P>

<P>Dr. Buzzard shook his head, and began to speak.</P>

<P>"Don't spoil my scenario!&nbsp; The scene changes.&nbsp; Could you not read 
the plain story of the footprints?&nbsp; I do not know why Harper came so 
stealthily to the house; but he was evidently crazy about Birdie Thorpe.&nbsp; 
He reaches the knoll.&nbsp; He sees her - the desirable woman of six or seven 
years before - become the ghastly crone you saw two days ago.&nbsp; Not yet 
thirty-five!</P>

<P>"And what is she doing?&nbsp; She does not see him at all, for she is 
standing by a pool in the swamp, throwing her little child to the 
alligators!"</P>

<P>"Good God!" cried Buzzard, leaping from his chair.&nbsp; "Who told you 
so?"</P> 

<P>"She said so in my presence.&nbsp; She did not want her to grow up like 
Selma to disgrace her!"</P>

<P>"Good God!&nbsp; Good God!"</P>

<P>"I am sometimes tempted to doubt it," remarked Simon Iff with acidity.</P>

<P>"I suppose that's right," said Buzzard, chewing the cud of his memory of 
the trail.&nbsp; "She could have taken the child, walking, to the jungle, and 
led it in, leaving that torn rag.&nbsp; Then she could have picked her up, and 
gone to the swamp.&nbsp; She had a good story to cover her tracks over 
there.&nbsp; Probably Harper saw just the end of it, the brute's snout 
snapping at the screaming baby, and the mother crying out to Jesus Christ!</P>

<P>"They do that in India too, don't they, by the way?"</P>

<P>"No," snapped Simon.&nbsp; "Only another missionary lie."</P>

<P>"Well, no wonder Harper went clean crazy and ran from the accursed house 
until his brain burst!"</P>

<P>"That's how I read it."</P>

<P>"Say, but I've got to put Higgs wise to this."&nbsp; He got up to 
telephone.</P>

<P>"Oh, I wouldn't," said Simon, very wearily.&nbsp; "If you're peeved with 
her, why not just leave her in Florida?"</P>

<P>"I guess hell is too good for her."</P>

<P>"No fear o'that.&nbsp; She had the only right kind of baptism."</P>

<P>Mrs. Mills swept into the room, radiant, with Agnes in tow.</P>

<P>"Oh, my dear Mr. Iff, I'm so glad to see you back.&nbsp; I hope you have had 
a perfectly lovely time.&nbsp; There's more work for you, haven't you 
heard?&nbsp; Mysterious disappearance of a girl named Alma Something.&nbsp; 
I suppose it's only the White Slave Traffic, but probably you'd like to detect 
it, wouldn't you?&nbsp; It must be deliciously exciting."</P>

<P>"I am afraid I must really go back to my meditation.&nbsp; But I'll tell 
you what, if you're fond of your joke, why not wire Dolores Travis - the 
famous Cass girl, you know? - to come and spend a week or so with you.&nbsp; 
Just indicate the facts of the mystery, and say I'm here, but too busy to take 
the case."</P>

<P>Mrs. Mills bustled out to send a telegram, while Simple Simon lay back in 
his chair chuckling.</P>

<P>"A little touched, too, for all his cleverness, just a little touched!" 
murmured Buzzard under his breath.</P>

<P>'The plans of mice and men gang aft agley;' and so, now and then, do those 
of Mrs. Mills.</P>

<P>Dinner brought her a telegram.&nbsp; Dolores Travis regretted that social 
engagements in Boston prevented her, etc.</P>

<P>The 'Travis' and the 'social engagements' were two good hard slaps for 
Simon Iff.</P>

<P>He opened his own telegram with apprehension.&nbsp; It read.&nbsp; "Once 
bit, twice shy.&nbsp; Dolores Cass."</P>

<P>Two more!</P>
