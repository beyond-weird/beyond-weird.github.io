A Dangerous Safe 
Trick</h2></CENTER>

<CENTER><h3 class="heading">

<P>"Ladies and gentlemen!&nbsp; I have a confession to make to you.&nbsp; I 
am leading a double life!&nbsp; (Laughter)&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I got 
tired of being as ugly as you see me now.&nbsp; (Laughter)&nbsp; ('Opopo' was 
a singularly handsome man.)&nbsp; Fortunately one day as I was walking down 
Broadway, I met a benevolent fairy (Laughter) who offered, as a reward for my 
well-known nobility of character, to give me a wish.&nbsp; I asked to be 
allowed to become a beautiful girl for at least part of every day.&nbsp; We 
fixed it for 10.15:&nbsp; dear me, it's nearly 10.15 now.&nbsp; I thought you 
would like to see the change - and so you shall.&nbsp; But fairies are very 
particular about their work; the actual operation must be done in 
darkness.&nbsp; Very thick darkness, ladies and gentlemen, for such powerful 
psychic force as this!&nbsp; So permit me to retire to the very complete 
seclusion of this excellent safe, which I perceive tasks the strength even of 
these four successors of Hercules."&nbsp; The audience in fact beheld a safe, 
just large enough to hold a man's body, borne from the wings by the staggering 
porters.</P>

<P>"Let me now introduce Mr. Nash, of the Manganese Safety Corporation."</P>

<P>Mr. Nash stepped forward with a bow.&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen," said he, 
"I represent the Manganese Safety Corporation.&nbsp; This is one of our latest 
pattern safes, of the regular type.&nbsp; It is not a trick safe.&nbsp; I have 
inspected it to-night.&nbsp; It has not in any way been tampered with.&nbsp; I 
have here a thousand dollar bill."&nbsp; (He waved it.)&nbsp; "Which I shall  
be pleased to present to any one who can prove the contrary, or to any yeggman 
in the theatre who without knowing the combination can open it in less than 
twenty-four hours, by drills, blowpipes, or high explosives."&nbsp; Mr. Nash 
retired, with another little bow.&nbsp; 'Opopo' continued his address.</P>

<P>"Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course quite obvious that any one can 
get out of a safe, sealed as this will be by a committee from the audience with 
their own private seals, and covered with a tarpaulin, corded, and seals again 
placed upon the cords, and disappear by means of a trap-door.&nbsp; To obviate 
this, a large sheet of tinfoil will be placed beneath the safe.&nbsp; Hey, 
tinfoil, where are you?&nbsp; You're keeping the stage waiting.&nbsp; You'll 
hear of this on Friday!"</P>

<P>Two men entered with a square of quivering steel, three yards by three.</P>

<P>"Now, may I request half-a-dozen ladies and gentlemen to come upon the 
stage?&nbsp; I should like the audience to feel assured that there is no 
trickery about this plate.&nbsp; No sliding panels, secret doors, springs, 
hinges, or places of concealment!"&nbsp; After the usual momentary hesitation, 
the required committee stepped sheepishly upon the stage, and took the chairs 
provided for them by the 'supers'.</P>

<P>"Welcome!" cried Opopo.&nbsp; "Roam freely where you will.&nbsp; Examine 
everything you see!&nbsp; Yes, sir," he addressed a man who was looking at the 
plate with what he possibly supposed to be a knowing air.&nbsp; "Yes, sir, you 
are right again.&nbsp; That is how the trick is done!"</P>

<P>The men turned the edge of the steel sheet every way to the audience.&nbsp; 
It was obviously what it appeared to be.&nbsp; It was barely thicker than a 
sheet of paper.</P>

<P>The men laid it down carefully.&nbsp; Opopo picked up a roll of green 
baize, brought it with the safe, and tossed it with apparent carelessness on 
to the plate, which it was large enough to cover completely.&nbsp; "Put the 
safe on the middle!"</P>

<P>"Excuse me!" said one of the committee.&nbsp; "I should like to examine 
that cloth!"</P>

<P>'Opopo' protested.&nbsp; "We don't want to draw out this examination; we're 
tied for time.&nbsp; Miss Frolic was furious last night because we kept her 
waiting."</P>

<P>"I apologize to the lady," said the committeeman sturdily, feeling like the 
Elder Cato, "but I must insist."</P>

<P>It was a perfectly ordinary piece of green baize in ever respect, and the 
committeeman retired, with the Elder Cato feeling gone <I>'avay in der 
ewigkeit'</I>.&nbsp; Opopo replaced it.&nbsp; The tarpaulin was next produced 
and examined.&nbsp; It was shaped to the safe, and could be fastened by a cord 
running in and out through a series of rings.&nbsp; This cord, tied, and 
sealed from without, appeared a singularly simple and secure protection.&nbsp; 
Two men put this loosely about the safe, which they then placed in the centre 
of the steel plate.&nbsp; Opopo threw back the tarpaulin and opened it.</P>

<P>"You will now please rope and handcuff me as much as you like, and shut me 
in.&nbsp; I will ask one member of the committee, and one alone, to reset the 
combination, so that neither I, nor any possible confederate, can open the 
safe from without until it is done in full view of the audience.&nbsp; You 
will kindly seal the door with your own private seals.&nbsp; You will then be 
good enough to fasten the tarpaulin, and seal that.&nbsp; In order to make 
sure that I do not escape North, East, South, West, or above, as you have 
already arranged in the matter of the floor, you will please adjust the tent, 
which as you see is made of ordinary linen sheets supported on a light bamboo 
framework."</P>

<P>The committee verified this statement.&nbsp; Opopo then removed his evening 
clothes, appearing in tights, and they affixed ropes and chains to their 
hearts' content.&nbsp; He then got into the safe.&nbsp; "Good-night, ladies 
and gentlemen!&nbsp; When you next see me, I shall be a beautiful young 
girl.&nbsp; You will know when the change has been operated by my beginning 
to sing in a mezzo soprano which has been highly praised.&nbsp; You will then 
kindly release me from my imprisonment."</P>

<P>He closed the door.&nbsp; The committee went through the dreary formalities 
to the foregone conclusion; having removed the tent, and investigated the 
seals, which were intact, the safe was opened, and a charming young lady 
stepped out upon the stage.&nbsp; "I am sorry to bid you good-night," she 
said.&nbsp; "Just one snatch of song while our friends here regain their 
seats; and then I will be off to dance at Yvette's."</P>

<P>She sang a pretty Italian air, and down came the curtain behind her.&nbsp; 
As she turned, Opopo advanced from the wings, and took her hand for the final 
applause.&nbsp; It was a very finished performance; fourteen minutes and seven 
seconds by Simon Iff's watch.</P>

<P>"Neatly presented," he remarked to Signorina Visconti, "but the method is 
a little too obvious."</P>

<P>"I don't see how it's done at all.&nbsp; But I rather suspect that steel 
plate."</P>

<P>"Delightful child!&nbsp; That's true imagination.&nbsp; The trickery is 
likely to lie in the simplest and surest precaution against it.&nbsp; Like a 
problem by Sam Loyd.&nbsp; You're probably right."</P>

<P>"Is that it, then?&nbsp; But how?"</P>

<P>"Oh, about a dozen ways of doing it suggest themselves."</P>

<P>"I think it is pure psychism," remarked a very fat lady on the other side 
of the magician, in a very loud harsh voice, meant to be languishing.</P>

<P>Iff's lips curled rather bitterly.&nbsp; "None of my dozen explanations 
involve hypnotism, double personality, brain storms, undeveloped thyroid, or 
the fourth dimension.&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp; But I really cannot rise to 
those ethereal heights."</P>

<P>The Visconti appreciated the remark.</P>

<P>"Some people are all soul," she murmured, with an eye on the fat lady's 
corset, which reminded her of the Last Stand of the Old Guard.</P>

<P>"Yes; we should have insisted on confining him in one of those," laughed 
Iff gently, in her much-too-highly-convoluted ear.</P>

<P>Miss Frolic was 'chronis'; Iff and his companion wandered out into Broadway, 
and sought supper.</P>

<P><CENTER>II</CENTER></P>

<P>It was a sweltering day in August.&nbsp; The air was utterly stagnant.&nbsp; 
The thermometer stood at 102&#176;; but 102&#176; in Manhattan can be worse 
than 120&#176; elsewhere.&nbsp; The moisture was insufferable.&nbsp; The air 
was heavy with electricity.&nbsp; Those who had enough strength left to pray 
prayed for a thunderstorm.</P>

<P>Simon Iff was at work on a mathematical-philosophical treatise.&nbsp; He 
wished to follow in the footsteps of Pythagoras, Raymond Lully, and the 
founders of Freemasonry; to do for the modern scientific conception of the 
universe what they had done for their own conceptions, the expression of all 
known relations synthetically in an arithmetical or geometrical notation.&nbsp; 
There were not many people at work in New York that day.&nbsp; Men and horses 
were dying like flies.&nbsp; Enormous crowds lay gasping on the beaches, like 
fish taken from the water.&nbsp; The Mayor of the city was in the Adirondacks, 
fishing in the vicinity of cottages 'with a double coach-house' whose owners 
called him by his Christian name, and would do so as long as he was mayor, and 
could deliver the goods.</P>

But Simon Iff stayed grimly with his folios.&nbsp; Nor did he spare his 
servants.&nbsp; He had three cars delivering ice on the East side, careless of 
their upholstery.&nbsp; Nor did his men complain that he asked them to put in 
twelve hours of that fearful day; they made it sixteen, of their own 
accord.&nbsp; They had it all to themselves; no jealous millionaires jostled 
them in their errand.</P>

<P>It was a Monday, and far away in Chicago the bills of Helmuth's Sublime 
Vaudville had Opopo for a top-liner.</P>

<P>The newspapers of Tuesday morning had the sensation.&nbsp; The trick had 
failed; Opopo had been found dead when the safe was finally opened.&nbsp; 
There were no details; Opopo's wife, who had been present, forbade any of the 
assistants to say anything that might disclose the secret of the trick, which 
was her late husband's principal asset, unless and until official enquiry 
demanded it.&nbsp; The cause of death was beyond question, even before an 
examination of the body.&nbsp; As the door of the safe was opened the 
committeeman was sent staggering back, shocked almost out of life, by a gust 
of prussic acid.</P>

<P>Suicide!&nbsp; His last supreme achievement in advertisement.&nbsp; For to 
the first impression of the public any alternative appeared physically 
impossible.&nbsp; But the 'Chicago Pigeon' had telegraphed to New York for 
Wake Morningside, the famous expert in all manner of conjuring tricks and 
illusions, and exposer of many a fraudulent medium, to investigate the 
case.&nbsp; An hour after the despatch of the telegram, Morningside walked  
into the office of the paper!</P>

<P>"Say, some stunt!" was the editorial greeting.&nbsp; "How 'n 'll you get 
here?&nbsp; I wired an hour back, and nine hours after the story.&nbsp; Speak, 
mystic stranger!"</P>

<P>"Oh, I happened to be lecturing in Saint Louis, and I stopped off here to 
see the show.&nbsp; I was one of the committee."</P>

<P>"Gee, some luck!"</P>

<P>"I made an extremely careful examination of the apparatus.&nbsp; I got the 
facts exactly as they occurred.&nbsp; I examined the apparatus again after 
the safe was opened.&nbsp; And I have a story for you, complete from A to 
Z."</P>

<P>"Gee-whiz, we've got the world beat!"</P>

<P>"I put the whole thing down from my notes; I worked all night on it; 
finished twenty minutes before your wire came, forwarded on from New York."</P>

<P><CENTER>III</CENTER></P>

<P>At the same moment as this interview, Miss Mollie Madison rang with timid 
desperation at the door of Simon Iff's apartment.&nbsp; She would have braved 
a Rockefeller in his lair with greater courage, so far as awe went; but she 
felt, as did every one who knew him, the intensity of the mystic's loving 
kindness, so that with her shyness went an inexpressible confidence.</P>

<P>"I am unfeignedly glad to see you, my dear," he cried, coming forward with 
both hands outstretched; "you are an exquisite excuse for me to abandon my 
work.&nbsp; On a day like this too!&nbsp; It is a favour I shall not readily 
forget."</P>

<P>"You are the kindest, dearest man!"</P>

<P>"Well, tell me your sad story."</P>

<P>"It's the Safe Mystery, of course."</P>

<P>"What safe?"</P>

<P>"Haven't you seen the newspaper?"</P>

<P>"There isn't a word about it in the <I>Tao Teh Ching</I>."</P>

<P>"Oh, silly!&nbsp; I mean the New York papers."</P>

<P>"Better tell me!"</P>

<P>"Opopo is dead."</P>

<P>"All must die!"</P>

<P>"But not of prussic acid in a safe!"</P>

<P>"True, very true.&nbsp; Now I perceive a less altruistic object in your 
most timely visit than that of luring me from the blistering crags of 
transcendental philosophy to those primrose paths that lead to the 
everlasting bonfire of Titianesque Mollie Madison!"&nbsp; She blushed 
delightfully.</P>

<P>"The minute I saw it I called up the office and asked if I might cover the 
story, and mentioned you.&nbsp; They said there were no facts come through 
yet; I told them it was all the better; you didn't need anything so crude."</P>

<P>"Again I am betrayed!"</P>

<P>"I've told you practically the whole story already.&nbsp; Of course it's 
suicide, because it couldn't possibly be anything else; but there's no reason 
why he should have done it, except the stunt itself, and that's going a little 
far.&nbsp; His wife talks crazily, from grief."</P>

<P>"It isn't really a mystery, then; it's merely an eccentric action."</P>

<P>"Yes, I suppose so."</P>

<P>"But Opopo was not at all an eccentric man.&nbsp; He was prosperous, I 
imagine; his wife was apparently devoted to him; he must have been a steady, 
sober person to hold down his job; he was always inventing new tricks; he has 
written three books on illusions.&nbsp; Let us consider if his wife's talk is 
as crazy as it sounds.&nbsp; What is it?"</P>

<P>"She claims Miss Max - the girl he pretends to turn into, you know - did 
it."</P>

<P>"Let us consider this hypothesis.&nbsp; How is the trick done, anyhow?"</P>

<P>"Nobody knows."</P>

<P>"Oh yes, I know.&nbsp; I saw the show when it was at the Gloria.&nbsp; Let 
me show you at least how it could be done, on what I saw that night.</P>

<P>"First.&nbsp; A very thin elastic steel plate is put on the floor.&nbsp; 
Over this a green baize cloth is thrown, very carelessly.&nbsp; This action 
raised a protest, as the cloth had not been examined; time was occupied in the 
argument about it.&nbsp; Something important was certainly being done with 
that time.&nbsp; When ultimately replaced on the plate, it was not thrown 
loosely, but spread out carefully, leaving a yard of plate visible in front, 
and overlapping the bare stage behind.&nbsp; The safe was then placed on the 
centre of the plate, after being put in its tarpaulin.</P>

<P>"We can stop there, for the moment.&nbsp; We have a complete picture of the 
apparatus which is subsequently hidden by the tent for a few moments.&nbsp; We 
need not worry about the cords and handcuffs; Opopo would have had them off 
before the echoes of the clanging door had died away.&nbsp; The safe is of a 
pattern which opens from within at a touch.</P>

<P>"It is sealed; but as he enters it, he affixes a strip of oiled paper to 
the jamb, so that the seal comes away whole.&nbsp; He can then remove the 
paper, heat the back of the wax with a special instrument, and reseal the safe 
so as to defy detection.</P>

<P>"Opopo, then, hearing the tarpaulin pulled into position, puts out a hand 
and offers a 'false end', as it is called, to the man who is tying the 
cord.&nbsp; This cord is then not fastened at all till Opopo fastens it, 
later on.&nbsp; This he must do, lest the fraud be discovered during the 
opening.</P>

<P>"While the baize is lying on the plate, a second plate, containing an 
orifice large enough for a man to pass, is pushed, under cover of the baize, 
through a slit in the stage, beneath the first plate.&nbsp; While the baize 
is being spread - after the little controversy - he would always find a new 
way every night, no doubt, to distract attention - the first plate is pulled 
back through the slit.</P>

<P>"We thus have a simple means of exit.&nbsp; It is merely necessary to open 
a trap beneath the hole in the plate.&nbsp; The moment that the tent is in 
place, Miss Max comes up from beneath, and helps, if necessary, to adjust 
affairs plausibly.&nbsp; Possibly she is really needed to assist in the 
unfastening, though I doubt it.&nbsp; Opopo shuts her in the safe, attends to 
the resealing, and vanishes through the hole.&nbsp; The trick is turned.</P>

<P>"On the night I was there the time between the rise and fall of the curtain 
was fourteen minutes and seven seconds:&nbsp; between the veiling and 
unveiling of the safe thirty-eight seconds and three-fifths.&nbsp; That is,  
the safe was actually hidden from my sight for that period.&nbsp; It is a 
splendidly smart performance.&nbsp; Of course, I cannot be sure that they do 
it in the way I have indicated; but it is not far out.&nbsp; The escape is 
certainly through the stage, not in any other direction.</P>

<P>"It follows that every action must be done with incomparable verve and 
snap.&nbsp; They have to drill for weeks.&nbsp; Of course there's a little 
lee-way, but that's in case of a hitch.&nbsp; The brilliant effect depends 
entirely on the shortness of the time of veiling.&nbsp; Take sixty seconds, 
and people would begin to be bored.</P>

<P>"Now then - whom have we here?&nbsp; Opopo himself, Miss Max, and a man to 
work the exchange of the plates, unless she did it herself, as is possible.&nbsp; 
These people hate to multiply assistants; each one means a chance to let their 
secrets get out.&nbsp; The porters are mere supers, of course.</P>

<P>"However, it doesn't matter if there were twenty assistants.&nbsp; One 
person, and one only, had access to Opopo during that forty seconds more or 
less when the safe was veiled.&nbsp; At any other time, no one had access.&nbsp; 
Of course, Opopo was alone after he had shut her into the safe, but a third 
person could hardly have killed him and put him back and taken her out, 
without her noticing something unusual!&nbsp; We must therefore take out 
choice between suicide, and murder by Miss Max.</P>

<P>"We know nothing about Miss Max; but would any human being choose to 
commit murder in such a way?&nbsp; Her only chance of escape is the suicide 
theory, which she must have known to be unlikely - else why murder the man, 
for one thing?&nbsp; It would be sure to strike some one to suspect her, as 
the one person with access to Opopo; the prussic acid good-bye! as Swinburne 
says.&nbsp; She must have had a dozen better opportunities daily.&nbsp; Bring 
me motives by the wagon load, circumstantial evidence by the rod, pole, or 
perch, and I shall still say that she didn't do it, unless she is an epileptic 
maniac."</P>

<P>"I may print that?"</P>

<P>"Yes; but add that I think it is a case of murder."</P>

<P>"You just proved it wasn't!" cried Miss Mollie Madison in comic 
despair.</P>

<P>"Never in the world!&nbsp; Read over your notes!&nbsp; Also add this.&nbsp; 
My opinion is provisional; but it is the best that I can do without having any 
facts at all to guide me."</P>

<P>And so it came about that Wake Morningside's article and the interview with 
Simon Iff were printed in parallel columns under the heading:</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>'Opposite Opinions:&nbsp; the man who saw and heard everything, 
and the man who saw and heard nothing.'</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><CENTER>IV</CENTER></P>

<P>Wake Morningside's article was a feather in Simon Iff's cap in one 
respect.&nbsp; He agreed entirely as to the method of the trick.&nbsp; The 
second plate of steel, which was of course exposed by the authorities as 
being part of the apparatus, made that clear.</P>

<P>But what was new was actually the record of the events of the fatal 
night.&nbsp; Morningside had been on the committee.</P>

<P>The trick had passed off normally up to the moment of the veiling.&nbsp; 
The 'green baize argument' had been started by a voice from the gallery, an 
accomplice stationed for the purpose in case the committee failed to challenge 
Opopo on the subject.</P>

<P>Morningside took out his watch to time the period of veiling.&nbsp; 
Ninety-two seconds elapsed; he thought 'What a badly worked trick!'&nbsp; 
Then the curtain came down suddenly, cutting off the committee from the 
audience.&nbsp; He heard the stage manager apologizing, and a singer coming 
on in front of the curtain as the orchestra struck up.&nbsp; At the same time 
as the manager began his little speech, Miss Max ran in from the wings.&nbsp; 
'There's something wrong!' she said; 'open the safe, quick!'</P>

<P>Of course she had not the combination; only the committeeman knew that.&nbsp; 
The man rumbled; Mr. Nash ran up, got the word from him, and spun round the 
wheel.&nbsp; Both he and the committeeman were overpowered by the fume of the 
acid, and had to be treated medically.</P>

<P>Morningside kept his head, and examined the safe, discovering the trick by 
which the seals were affixed to a 'camouflage' strip of paper instead of to 
the steel jamb.&nbsp; He also discovered the 'false end' of the tarpaulin 
cord.&nbsp; Nothing had been touched from within; it was certain that Opopo 
had died almost immediately on entering the safe.&nbsp; In fact, he was still 
partially bound; his legs were tied firmly; his left arm still wore a 
handcuff.&nbsp; Only the right forearm was wholly free.</P>

<P>An inspector of police now appeared on the scene.&nbsp; The manager wanted 
the stage cleared; the inspector insisted that the audience be informed of the 
nature of the accident - so far as that it was not fire - and the house closed 
for the night, so that the coroner might view the body.&nbsp; The inspector 
took the names and addresses of the committee, that he might call them as 
witnesses.</P>

<P>Morningside dismissed the suicide theory as incredible.</P>

<P>The evidence of Opopo's wife was extremely sane and strong.&nbsp; He had 
bought a house only a month before; he was spending every day with her in 
delighted purchase of old furniture and pictures, in which he had always 
revelled.&nbsp; That very morning he had received a telegram informing him 
that the Supreme Court had confirmed a judgement in his favour relative to 
certain breaches of his copyright in the 'act'; and he had ordered a supper 
after the performance to celebrate it.&nbsp; He was not entangled with any 
woman; his marriage was only six months old; a baby was on the way, and his 
great wish had always been for a son to carry on the Opopo tradition, he 
himself being the third of that dynasty.&nbsp; Friends and colleagues 
confirmed this statement on many points.</P> 

<P>Morningside then proceeded to prove that in the ninety-two seconds at her 
disposal Miss Max could easily have accomplished the murder.&nbsp; She had 
almost certainly some quick method of learning the combination of the 
safe.&nbsp; There were fifty ways of informing her.&nbsp; It was probably 
necessary, since now and again Opopo might fail to free himself from the 
cords, and she would then have to help him.&nbsp; Therefore, she had but to 
open the safe, administer the poison, readjust it and the seals, do the same 
with the tarpaulin, and give the alarm.&nbsp; The closed safe was her 
alibi.</P>

<P>As to the motive, that was not the affair of Mr. Wake Morningside, and he 
was always the servant of the public.</P>

<P>The 'Chicago Pigeon' had not been content with one angle of the case.&nbsp; 
Another reporter had got after Miss Max; and Morningside's article was 
followed by her biography.</P>

<P>She was of poor parents of doubtful character, both dead or 
disappeared.&nbsp; Her mind was amazingly precocious; she had gained a 
scholarship at Bryn Mawr and specialized in chemistry.  (Chemistry, pray 
observe.)&nbsp; She had led a wild life there, and been expelled for an 
outrageous escapade.&nbsp; For two years, it seems, she had walked the streets, 
and on three occassions narrowly escaped conviction as a thief.&nbsp; She 
then fascinated a photographer - in whose studio, remarked the reporter, 
potassium cyanide abounds, and only needs distillation with sulphuric acid to  
produce the poison that killed Opopo.&nbsp; This photographer had died under 
suspicious circumstances.&nbsp; Miss Max disappeared for awhile; she was next 
heard of in connexion with a gang of coiners, but the police could get no 
evidence against her.&nbsp; She began to have plenty of money, however; and, 
with the help of an 'angel' appeared in a cabaret as a dancer.&nbsp; She next 
tried vaudeville in a Japanese juggling act, but failed lamentably.&nbsp; 
Here, however, she met Opopo.&nbsp; This was a year before his marriage.&nbsp; 
He engaged her as his assistant.&nbsp; She set her cap at him, but in 
vain.&nbsp; Shortly after his engagement to the lady whom he married, somebody 
threw vitriol at them, which luckily missed.&nbsp; She was suspected, but 
proved an alibi by three wealthy men, probably all of them under her 
spell.&nbsp; Recently she had renewed her advances to Opopo.&nbsp; Her 
extraordinary cleverness in the 'act', which was making big money, prevented 
him from discharging her.&nbsp; But ten days before his death he had 
interviewed another girl, it is said, and engaged her from the end of the 
following month.&nbsp; Miss Max might or might not have been cognizant of this 
fact, but it was natural to suppose that he had given her notice to quit.</P>

<P>An hour after the publication of this issue an 'extra' was being cried on 
the streets.&nbsp; The coroner's jury had brought in a verdict of murder 
against Miss Max, and she had been arrested.</P>

<P>"This", said Simon Iff, "is where I become the darling of the Great 
American People.&nbsp; Rise, Sir Simon Iff!&nbsp; My arms, thou gallant 
squire!&nbsp; My battle-charger, Eustace!&nbsp; Hie thee to King Arthur, 
Clarence, and lout thee low, and say Sir Simon is afield.&nbsp; Beauty and 
Innocence in danger!&nbsp; By'r Lady, the varlets shall rue it!"</P>

<P>This singular outburst was entirely unintelligible to Iff's Japanese 
servant, but he judged from his master's tone that brandy would fit the case; 
so he placed on the table a bottle of date eighteen hundred and eleven.</P>

<P>"Pack!" commanded Iff, "and telephone for berths to Chicago on the first 
good train we can conveniently catch."</P>

<P>It is to be regretted that Simple Simon now becomes a character more 
infamous than Benedict Arnold.&nbsp; He telephoned Miss Mollie Madison, and 
told her his intentions.&nbsp; She was not going to miss that chance, and she 
followed him to Chicago on the very next train.&nbsp; Thus simply and without 
effort do we incur fifteen year's imprisonment in the Land of the Free.</P>

<P>The wretched woman, now completely in the toils of the vilest of mankind, 
had breakfast with him at the Hotel Obsidian.&nbsp; He drank neat brandy like 
a fish, and became more sober and more angry every moment.</P>

<P>"We are up against it, little one", said he, lighting a Florida Cigar in 
order to become still angrier; "we have Idiocy and Malice to contend with in 
the persons of Wake Morningside and this dog Walter Gale - whose name I should 
prefer to pronounce in the French fashion.*</P>

<P>"There isn't a hint of any investigation, or evidence of any desire to 
discover the truth.&nbsp; It's the most blasted balderdash from one, the 
foulest libel from the other.&nbsp; Let's run through it!&nbsp; Here!&nbsp; 
Evidence of the wife.&nbsp; Very anxious to prove how much her husband loved 
her, isn't she?&nbsp; Methinks the lady doth protest too much.&nbsp; Well, 
never mind her; she's nobody; wives often are.</P>

<P>"Evidence of Mr. Expert Wake Morningside.&nbsp; Wake is either <I>'lucus a 
non lucendo'</I> or short for Quack.&nbsp; Hear him!&nbsp; 'She had <I>almost 
certainly</I> a way to get the word of the safe'.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; 'There 
were fifty ways of informing her.'&nbsp; Why not say one way, and mention 
it?</P>

<P>"'It was <I>probably</I> necessary'.</P>

<P>"'Opopo <I>might</I> fail'.&nbsp; He hasn't failed in thirty years on the 
stage, with the whole world, and his enemies in the profession, out to make a 
fool of him.</P>

<P>"'She <I>had but to</I>' perform a most complicated trick, which would 
certainly convict her.&nbsp; The wife, at least, would know how easy it would 
be for her, and her alone, to do it.&nbsp; And she is to do this, if you 
please, when Opopo is already out of his bonds, and free on the stage.&nbsp; 
She is to kill him and pack him up again, is she?&nbsp; The safe would 
certainly be open before she ever reached the stage.&nbsp; Thirty-eight 
seconds and three-fifths, for the whole transfer, the night I was present.&nbsp; 
Opopo didn't read any novels to pass away the time!</P>

<P>"So much for Mr. Morningside and his conjugation with may, might, could, 
should and would.&nbsp; Now for the unspeakable Gale!</P>

<P>"'She was of poor parents' - pah! poor! how disgusting!&nbsp; 'of doubtful 
character' - of course, no money.&nbsp; 'dead or disappeared' - disgraceful of  
them!&nbsp; Then comes a fact, a fact in her favour.&nbsp; She gained a 
scholarship.&nbsp; That fact can be tested.&nbsp; 'She was expelled for an 
escapade'.&nbsp; Was she judged fairly by those arbitrary dons?&nbsp; A poor 
girl, with no pull?&nbsp; And what's an 'escapade'?&nbsp; An innocent freak, 
or an assassination?&nbsp; Mr. Gale doesn't trouble to find out.</P>

<P>"She then walks the streets - <I>'it seems'</I>.&nbsp; Where else would 
anybody walk?</P>

<P>"She 'narrowly escapes conviction as a thief'.&nbsp; In English, she was 
acquitted.&nbsp; Pretty good for a <I>poor</I> girl, I think.</P>

<P>"'She then <I>fascinated</I> a photographer' - English, she got a job.</P>

<P>"'In the studio potassium cyanide abounds' - there's no English, thank God, 
for this filthy type of innuendo.</P>

<P>"He died 'under suspicious circumstances'.&nbsp; Who suspected what?</P>

<P>"She is <I>'heard of in connexion with</I> a gang of coiners'.&nbsp; What's 
the connexion?&nbsp; 'The police could get no evidence against her!'&nbsp; 
Those miserable police - we reporters could teach them something!&nbsp; Then 
she dances in a cabaret - dreadful.&nbsp; Then she goes into vaudeville - more 
dreadful still.</P>

<P>"'She set her cap at him, but in vain.'&nbsp; Who says so?&nbsp; The 
jealous wife, again?&nbsp; '<I>Somebody</I> throws vitriol - and misses.&nbsp; 
Who was it?&nbsp; Miss Max, of course, a girl who has been in a Japanese 
Juggling Act.&nbsp; Yet she misses two people completely, not with a rifle at 
a thousand yards, but with vitriol!</P>

<P>"'She was suspected,' and her alibi is so good that it must be false.&nbsp; 
The three men '<I>probably</I> all of them under her spell' - when the theory 
is that she is crazily in love with Opopo, and would have to explain the 
object of the alibi to the false witnesses.&nbsp; 'Wealthy men' have to be 
under all kinds of a spell to take a long chance of prison for the sake of a 
girl in love with another man!</P>

<P>"Then she 'renews her advances' to Opopo after his marriage.&nbsp; The wife 
again?&nbsp; And then he engages another girl, '<I>it is said</I>'?&nbsp; 
Green room gossip.</P>

<P>"And it all ends up 'it is natural to suppose.'&nbsp; I suppose it <I>is</I> 
natural to suppose, to some people!&nbsp; The long and the short of it is that 
this whole article is a most damnable tissue of malicious lying and 
guessing.&nbsp; There's not one single proved fact to her discredit.&nbsp; 
And is it 'natural to suppose' that this debauched harlot keeps herself clean 
and keen, every muscle taut, every nerve alert, as she must do to go through 
that act?&nbsp; I saw her.&nbsp; She's as swift and slender as Artemis, her 
eyes aglitter, her lips firm, not an ounce of waste flesh; as you would 
perhaps say in an outburst of frankness, 'Gee, what a peach!'&nbsp; I may be 
an old dotard, but I thought her a perfect type of woman.&nbsp; She may be 
'immoral' in your vile Puritanical sense; but she's mistress of herself, if I 
ever saw one.&nbsp; Why, it's Love that gives strength and courage and 
vitality to those that serve Him wisely and gaily and with passion!"</P>

<P>"I'm feeling ever so much better, Mr. Iff!"</P>

<P>"If you're through breakfast, suppose we go and hunt up some real 
evidence!"</P>

<P>Simple Simon had bethought him to ask Teake to telephone the Chicago Police 
to help him, and the Commissioner had gladly complied.&nbsp; In fact, he was 
cursing fate that his duties would not let him leave New York.&nbsp; He would 
have dearly loved to hunt with Simon Iff.</P>

<P>He found Rogers, the 'Whip of Chicago' as they called him, in consultation 
with the District Attorney.&nbsp; They greeted him warmly, but were not 
particularly pleased when he announced his belief in the innocence of Miss 
Max.</P>

<P>"You're butting into an impossibility", said Rogers.&nbsp; The truth was 
that both men were extremely sore over a wrongful arrest, which had let the 
city in for heavy damages, and a fiasco in the matter of a raid, which had 
made the administration ridiculous.&nbsp; Their political existence was at 
stake; they could afford no more blunders.</P>

<P>Iff, with matchless tact - the wrong way round - tackled them directly.&nbsp; 
"Go slow!" he said, "the longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home, 
and kind hearts are more than coronets, and all that.&nbsp; Give that poor 
girl every courtesy and comfort that you can; with a little luck, I'll have 
the right man for you in four-and-twenty hours, and you'll be glad you did 
it."</P>

<P>"That's a bet," said Rogers, heartily, clasping Iff by the hand; "she shall 
have champaign and caviar till to-morrow morning."</P>

<P>"Done!" cried Iff, "and now may I have an hour with the exhibits?"</P>

<P>Rogers conducted Iff to a vast room where the apparatus was stored.&nbsp; 
It had been set up in position; the corpse of Opopo was replaced by a wax 
model, the cords and handcuffs replaced exactly as they were when he was 
found.</P>

<P>"Beautiful!" cried Simon, "you really merit your success.&nbsp; This is 
true imagination.&nbsp; Beautiful, beautiful!"</P>

<P>Rogers was much gratified.</P>

<P>"But where," asked the mystic, "is the phial containing the poison?"</P>

<P>"She destroyed it, obviously."</P>

<P>"You looked for it?"</P>

<P>"Everywhere."</P>

<P>"Beneath the stage?"</P>

<P>"Especially there."</P>

<P>"Good."</P>

<P>"She wasn't arrested till yesterday; she had plenty of opportunity to get 
rid of it."</P>

<P>"But she didn't know that; she might have been arrested at once - with 
Mrs. Opopo in the house.&nbsp; She would have got rid of it before giving the 
alarm."</P>

<P>"An accomplice under the stage?"</P>

<P>"Possibly, possibly.&nbsp; But do you mind if I look for myself?"</P>

<P>"Sure.&nbsp; But where?"</P>

<P>"Here - and now."</P>

<P>Simple Simon inspected the inside of the safe with extreme care.&nbsp; He 
had the model removed, and renewed his effort.&nbsp; His delicate fingers 
seemed to caress the steel.&nbsp; Presently he withdrew, and began to examine 
the bonds that held the model.&nbsp; He seemed less interested than before; 
he was languid and distracted.&nbsp; "What's the use," he said slowly after a 
few minutes, "when one knows?"</P>

<P>Rogers was not at all impressed.</P>

<P>"Let's get down to business," suddenly snapped Simon, an entirely different 
person, "I want to see that committee.&nbsp; I may get some sense out of 
them."</P>

<P>"Wake Morningside's here now, as it happens; he wants leave to go on to 
New York."</P>

<P>"Lucky; let's see him!&nbsp; Here, for choice!"</P>

<P>"I'll send for him."</P>

<P>Morningside arrived in a few moments.&nbsp; After the usual phrases of 
commonplace, Simon Iff began his attack.</P>

<P>"Forgive the impertinence of an old man to a young one, won't you?&nbsp; 
But you should always stick to the indicative mood.&nbsp; The subjunctive's 
poison to you.&nbsp; I think I may say that I've never known you wrong in a 
fact, or right in a theory.&nbsp; You've got observation skinned to a whisper 
(isn't it?) but your imagination is absolutely on the blink."&nbsp; He looked 
mildly to Rogers for encouragement in his efforts to talk the vernacular, but 
that deity was wholly occupied in chewing a cigar.&nbsp; Simon Iff thought of 
the priests of Baal, and wondered if he would do any good by crying and 
cutting himself with stones.&nbsp; Morningside was making his defence, and it 
would have been impolite to interrupt.&nbsp; Consequently, his mind was 
absolutely free to roam.</P>

<P>The moment Morningside concluded, he began, "This, Morningside, is why I 
rely absolutely upon your memory to solve this mystery.&nbsp; Which of the 
numerous fools on the committee brought those hard cords to tie a man up 
with?"</P>

<P>"They came from the theatre.&nbsp; Opopo provided them himself.&nbsp; Most 
people don't know how easy it is to slip the knot up with such stuff as 
that."</P>

<P>"I thought so.&nbsp; You, of course, are the wily old bird who supplied 
that soft cotton cord, and tied it properly?"</P>

<P>Morningside, pleased, nodded assent.</P>

<P>"There's one cord, thicker than yours and nearly as soft, with a curious 
knot behind the man's back that has pulled very tight."</P>

<P>"Yes."&nbsp; Morningside began to take interest.&nbsp; Rogers chewed his 
cigar like a cow with its cud.</P>

<P>"A cord which is neither quite right, nor quite wrong, for its purpose.&nbsp; 
A knot which implies considerable knowledge of knots, and quite wrong for its 
purpose."</P>

<P>"Now you mention it, that's so."</P>

<P>"Remember who brought that cord?"</P>

<P>"Yes, a tall thin man of about thirty."</P>

<P>"Because, when we pull that knot open in court, at the critical moment, we 
shall find a film of paraffin wax, or some very similar substance."</P>

<P>Rogers chewed his cigar with unabated determination; he spoke through his 
teeth.</P>

<P>"Very pretty work, Mr. Iff.&nbsp; I'll go get Professor William Henry 
Stubbs, born in Cincinnati, Ohio, May twenty-nine, eighteen hundred and 
eighty-two, educated at public schools and at the University of Cornell, 
travelled in Europe from June nineteen hundred and one to October nineteen 
hundred and five, took degree of doctor of science at Heidelberg nineteen 
hundred and five, inherited four thousand three hundred and sixty dollars 
in August nineteen hundred and six through the death of his mother, his father 
having died in infancy; lectured in Middle West and around the Coast during 
nineteen hundred and seven and nineteen hundred and eight; November of that 
year met Emma Susan Cooper, aged thirty-one and married her - January third, 
nineteen hundred and nine; obtained post of Professor of Physics in the 
Hazelrigg Simons University, Botts, Colorado, in March of the same year; 
separated from his wife May nineteen hundred and ten, she visited the east 
under the name of Miss Madeline Adams, and exchanging constantly letters of 
affection with him; met her in Denver, Colorado, and spent a week with her at 
Christmas of that year; ceased to correspond with her in February of this 
year, but left Botts, Colorado, for this city, on Tuesday of last week on 
receipt of an unsigned telegram, giving the Dyer's Convention as an excuse 
for his absence, which convention he has punctually attended; was present at 
Helmuth's Sublime Vaudeville on Monday night of this week, and joined the  
committee on the stage at the presentation of the act of the late Opopo, alias 
John Drew Westcott, which was the true name of that performer."</P>

<P>He recommenced a more active mastication of his cigar.&nbsp; During his 
whole speech he had never faltered, or changed his tone or his expression.</P>

<P>"Beautiful, beautiful!" cried Simon, as delighted as he had been with the 
reconstruction of the stage scene.&nbsp; "And I take it that you will also get 
Emma Susan Cooper, or Stubbs, alias Madeline Adams, or Westcott."</P>

<P>"I shall," said the Sphinx, stolidly.&nbsp; "She put him up to it.&nbsp; 
Plenty of property, all settled on her; and twelve thousand plunks from the 
insurance people."</P>

<P>"Why didn't you act?" put in Morningside.</P>

<P>"Couldn't see the possibility, same as you couldn't," retorted Rogers, 
rather cruelly.&nbsp; "Simple, ain't it, when you get on to it?&nbsp; 
Paraffin capsul in a knot.&nbsp; His first jerk for freedom, and the knot 
pulls tight, and the capsul crushes, and it's up the golden stairs singing 
Glory Hallelujeh!&nbsp; Say, Mr. Iff, that was bully work, though, when you 
didn't know.&nbsp; Gee!&nbsp; I was sore on you this morning; thought you'd 
stall me off by proving that girl didn't do it, and scare the game!"</P>

<P>"We've both gone wrong," murmured Iff, "through taking each other for quite 
unpardonable fools!"</P>

<P>"How'd you get wise?"</P>

<P>"Easy," said Simple Simon.&nbsp; "Miss Max couldn't have done it.&nbsp; The 
man was dead before she reached the stage.&nbsp; Then somebody else did 
it.&nbsp; One of the committee, for certain.&nbsp; Morningside had examined 
everything, and found no prussic acid.&nbsp; I just ran over the walls of the 
safe, on the chance of some attachment there which he might have 
overlooked.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Then who could have introduced what into that 
safe?&nbsp; Only a committeeman; only a cord.&nbsp; it was then merely a 
question of which cord.&nbsp; One couldn't easily fix a delicate capsul - a 
mere film of wax, in order to escape detection - in a hard cord, or a thin 
one.&nbsp; I knew the kind of cord Morningside would bring, and it wasn't he 
that did it.&nbsp; He hasn't got the imagination.&nbsp; Only one cord 
remains.&nbsp; Morningside's admirable faculties at once enabled us to 
discover who brought it.&nbsp; And then you opened with all that heavy 
artillery.&nbsp; Great work!"</P>

<P>"It's rather shocking," said Morningside, "Mrs. Westcott, or rather Stubbs, 
being enceinte.</P>

<P>"Now, they all try that.&nbsp; Ovariotomy, following disease, in September, 
nineteen hundred and nine."</P>

<P>"And it's been a terrible experience for Miss Max," was Morningside's final 
broadside.</P>

<P>"Wish I had a cent for every dollar she gets out of the 'Pigeon'.&nbsp; 
Gee, but she'll pluck that bird!&nbsp; Guess I'll fix Old Man Stubbs and 
Missis Emma Susan now.&nbsp; You can hike right on down East, Mr. 
Morningside.&nbsp; We'll want you for the trial; you'll get a wire, all 
right!&nbsp; Might I have the pleasure of your company at dinner, Mr. Iff; 
I'd like you to meet my wife.&nbsp; She keeps my records."</P>

<P>"Thanks, I'd like to.&nbsp; And may I bring Miss Mollie Madison?&nbsp; 
She keeps mine."</P>
