The Pasquaney 
Puzzle</h2></CENTER>

<CENTER><h3 class="heading">by Aleister 
Crowley</h3></CENTER>

<P>Sir Humphrey Davy, after his first experiment with the inhalation of ether, 
exclaimed, "The Universe is composed solely of ideas."&nbsp; Simon Iff had 
obtained that, and many another, experience, without the aid of drugs.&nbsp; 
But although he was perfectly convinced that 'everything is illusion', like 
the most advanced transcendental philosophers, he was equally sure that all 
illusion was interwoven in a causal nexus.&nbsp; There was no place in his 
universe for accident; there was no force so small that the cosmos failed to 
vibrate in due degree with it; and there was (further) no means of erasure 
applicable to any action.&nbsp; Nothing could be destroyed; so it was there 
if you could only find it; and the task of finding it was nothing but the 
removal of the masks and veils.&nbsp; He was only interested in crime because 
its detection sharpened the wits which he needed in the solution of 
philosophical problems.&nbsp; He used to say that the fundamental laws of 
thought were the true obstacles to thinking.&nbsp; "My conviction that two and 
two make four is the limitation that hinders me from realizing that they make 
five, as they must, or how could the universe itself have come from 
nothing?&nbsp; It is the difference between the human mind and the Divine!"</P>

<P>That was the conclusion of a little interview that he gave to a 
particularly enterprising lady reporter.&nbsp; He had succeeded for three 
months in keeping everybody away; but Miss Mollie Madison had been one too 
many for him.&nbsp; She had found a way to induce his Japanese servant to let 
her wait in his apartment, and, once installed, had caught his interest by 
asking him point blank for his solution of the Pasquaney Puzzle.&nbsp; "In 
me," she exclaimed dramatically, "you behold the unhappy Dolores Cass!"</P>

<P>"Excuse me, I do not," he answered; "I never heard of the Pasquaney 
Puzzle, and I know nothing of Dolores Cass.&nbsp; But you are certainly not an 
unhappy anybody."</P>

<P>"Indeed, indeed, do not mock my misery!" she cried, tears standing in her 
big blue eyes.</P>

<P>"Delightful infant!&nbsp; Old birds are not to be caught with chaff.&nbsp; 
You're functioning - functioning in absolute harmony - which is the medical 
equivalent - in bad English - of being happy.&nbsp; At this particular moment, 
I perceive, you are unusually happy, even for you; and as you are an American, 
I assume that you are, somehow or other, putting one over on me.&nbsp; You're 
getting what you came for - be frank, now!&nbsp; It won't hurt you with 
me!"</P>

<P>She dropped her masquerade and laughed at him like the beautiful doll she 
was.</P>

<P>"Surely, Mr. Iff!&nbsp; I'm getting the most adorable interview."</P>

<P>"All right:&nbsp; what can I do for you?"</P>

<P>"Do tell me your views on everything!"</P>

<P>This was walking into the enemy's country, had she known it.&nbsp; Simple 
Simon took his revenge by doing as she asked.&nbsp; When he got to the "two 
and two make five" peroration, she was sitting with note book and pencil 
fallen despairingly in her lap.</P>

<P>"It's a shame, truly it is, Mr. Iff!&nbsp; You know I can't write up all 
that highbrow stuff.&nbsp; It's absorbing to me, but the public won't stand 
for it."</P>

<P>"Oh Democracy!&nbsp; Why is it that everybody I meet in this country is so 
eager to explain that everybody else is a fool?&nbsp; If you really respected 
and trusted the people, you wouldn't treat them as mental and moral 
imbeciles.&nbsp; I refer to your literature and your laws."</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison was not quite sure of the answer.</P>

<P>"Observe me, now!" said the mystic.&nbsp; "I go on the opposite track.&nbsp; 
The unknown fascinates me.&nbsp; So I implore you humbly to put me wise to the 
dope on the Pasquaney Puzzle."</P>

<P>His sudden slang put her tremendously at her ease.&nbsp; She took a packet 
of yellow paper from her vanity bag.&nbsp; "I've got it all pat.&nbsp; I've 
read nothing else for a week.&nbsp; It was my one hope of getting you 
interested.&nbsp; You can rely on the facts; most of this was written up by 
one of the best men in the office."</P>

<P>"We'll hope your bait of falsehood may catch a carp of truth.&nbsp; Put in 
your clutch!"</P>

<P>"Lake Pasquaney lies among the mountains of New Hampshire.&nbsp; It is 
about 17 miles in circumference.&nbsp; Bristol, the nearest railway station, 
a town of 1200 inhabitants, is some three miles from the lower end.&nbsp; The 
lake contains several islands, and its shores are dotted with summer villas, 
mostly of the long hut type, though here and there is a more pretentious 
structure, or a cluster of boarding-houses.&nbsp; Bristol is about three 
hours from Boston, so the lake is a favourite summer resort, even for 
week-enders.&nbsp; Automobile parties pass frequently, but keep mostly to the 
road on the east shore, that on the west being very rough.&nbsp; The scenery 
is said by Europeans who know both to compare with Scotland or Switzerland 
without too serious disadvantage."</P>

<P>She looked merrily at him, and he smiled in grim appreciation of her subtle 
attack.</P>

<P>"Mrs. Cass is a woman of fifty-three years old, the widow of a wealthy 
Bostonian of good family, known all over the world for his attainments in pure 
mathematics."</P>

<P>"Oh, <I>the</I> Cass!&nbsp; Indeed, this becomes very enthralling!&nbsp; 
I was exceedingly intrigued by his monograph on hyperbolic geometry, and his 
criticism of Sir William Thomson's theory of a labile ether."</P>

<P>"Mrs. Cass has four children; Newton Gauss, thirty, a prominent engineer; 
Hope Ada, twenty-five; Dolores, twenty-two; and Emily, nineteen.&nbsp; Last 
summer she rented a cottage which occupies one of the islands from July first 
to September thirtieth.&nbsp; Hope Ada is married to a surgeon named 
Smith.&nbsp; He and Newton used to come up from Boston whenever they could 
leave their work, and with them Geoffrey Travis, a shipowner, twenty-six 
years old, who was engaged to marry Dolores.&nbsp; Emily was also engaged; 
but her fianc&#233;, Arthur Green, was away in Los Angeles on some business 
connected with moving pictures.</P>

<P>"Mrs. Cass did a good deal of entertaining; every evening the cottage 
would be filled with a merry party of friends from other cottages on the 
lake.&nbsp; The day was filled with boating, fishing, bathing, walking, 
motoring, every conceivable form of amusement.&nbsp; There was not a 
disagreement or a dull moment, week after week.&nbsp; The servants were all 
old and tried friends of the family."</P>

<P>The girl paused.&nbsp; "Do you know, Mr. Iff, there is really no object in 
my telling you all these details?&nbsp; The problem which arose on August the 
eighth is utterly insoluble.&nbsp; It is entirely remote from the 
situation.&nbsp; It means absolutely nothing."</P>

<P>"All the better.&nbsp; But describe Dolores a little."</P>

<P>"She is a college girl, taking after her father in looks, and in 
mathematics.&nbsp; She was a pupil, also, of Professor Hugo Munsterberg, and 
had made a profound study of the evidence for spirit return.&nbsp; The year 
before, she had gone to Europe especially to sit with Eusapia Palladino and 
other famous mediums.&nbsp; Her mind is always at work on these lines.&nbsp; 
After a swim she would dry off on the beach with a note book.&nbsp; But she 
is not a blue-stocking.&nbsp; She is pretty, blonde, plump, lovely ....."</P>

<P>"You called her unhappy."</P>

<P>"I'm describing her as she was up to August the seventh."</P>

<P>"I see."</P>

<P>"She had not a care in the world.&nbsp; She was the life of the whole 
family.&nbsp; The others were more serious, but without her distinction.&nbsp; 
She lived in extremes; one minute she would be romping like a mad creature, 
the next immersed in conic sections."</P>

<P>"Nobody envious?"</P>

<P>"Not a scrap.&nbsp; Not enough imagination, I should say.&nbsp; Besides, 
she was the most unselfish, sweet-tempered woman that God ever made."</P>

<P>"Enter August the eighth."</P>

<P>"With all the calm and brilliance of heaven itself!&nbsp; On that morning, 
the three girls got up early for a swim.&nbsp; They paddled up to a 
neighbouring islet in a canoe.&nbsp; This islet contains a particularly 
secluded cove.&nbsp; There is no cottage on it; only a few trees; there is no 
place to hide a rabbit.&nbsp; It stands well out in the lake.&nbsp; Dolores, 
though a brilliant athlete otherwise, was a poor swimmer; if she had been left 
alone on the islet she would have had to stay there till rescued.</P>

<P>"The three girls proceeded to bathe.&nbsp; (Of course they had gone out in 
their bathing suits.)&nbsp; Suddenly Hope missed Dolores, took alarm, and 
called her.&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; She and Emily searched the islet; no sign 
of Dolores.&nbsp; They became hysterical.&nbsp; Just then they saw the other 
canoe; the men, Newton, Smith, and Travis, were paddling out to find them.&nbsp; 
Hearing the girls scream, they redoubled their speed.&nbsp; A further search 
was made; it was as futile as the former.&nbsp; The whole party, except Smith, 
seem to have gone crazy with horror.&nbsp; Smith had hard work to get them 
back to the cottage.&nbsp; But, as they approached the island, what was their 
amazement to see Dolores walking up to the front door?&nbsp; With shouts of 
relief and joy they paddled gaily onwards, not considering at that moment 
that an impossibility had occurred; that she literally couldn't have got 
there, and had therefore no sort of right to be there!</P>

<P>"They entered the cottage.&nbsp; Mrs. Cass was at the breakfast table, 
Dolores was just sitting down, and saying 'What's the big idea, moms?'</P>

<P>"And then they all realized, as Mrs. Cass had just done, that it was not 
Dolores at all!</P>

<P>"Her lover and her sisters had run forward to embrace her; they recoiled 
in sudden terror.&nbsp; Mrs. Cass was shocked almost senseless; yet it was 
she who first cried, 'Then where is Dolores?'</P>

<P>"Smith told his story; then Hope told hers.&nbsp; Every one was aghast.</P>

<P>"Then Smith, whose scientific training seems to have served him well, 
grasped how bizarre the problem was.&nbsp; He turned to the girl in the 
chair:&nbsp; 'Who are you, and how did you get here?'</P>

<P>"She stood up, pale as death.&nbsp; 'Is it a charade?' she cried.&nbsp; 
'I'm Dolores; don't you know me?'</P>

<P>"'How did you get here?' insisted Smith.</P>

<P>"She could not or would not say.</P>

<P>"'That settles it,' said he, and went to the telephone to call up the 
police, and Maddingley, a detective inspector from Boston in whose powers he 
had great confidence.&nbsp; Meanwhile a storm raged in the dining-room.</P>

<P>"'Don't I know my own daughter?' cried Mrs. Cass.</P>

<P>"'Where is the ring I gave you, if you are Dolores?' said her lover.</P>

<P>"The argument raged all morning.&nbsp; Smith rang up a general alarm; the 
whole lakeside population turned out to scour the woods, to dredge the lake 
about the fatal islet.&nbsp; Nothing was found.&nbsp; Maddingley had caught 
the early train from Boston and arrived a little before noon.&nbsp; He entered 
what he thought was an insane asylum!&nbsp; He and Smith obtained silence, and 
a rational examination began.&nbsp; There was absolute agreement between all 
the witnesses.&nbsp; The stranger looked like Dolores, talked like her, acted 
like her; there wasn't a thing missing of the tangible kind, except the ring; 
but it was not Dolores.&nbsp; She, on her side, underwent the most critical 
tests.&nbsp; She knew the family history, every detail correct; she described 
the position of the furniture in her bedroom, the contents of every drawer, 
even the secrets of a cashbox with a Yale lock, which she asked them to open, 
after telling them where she had hidden the key.&nbsp; The servants were 
examined also; they agreed with the family.&nbsp; It was the story of the 
Tichborne Claimant reversed.&nbsp; The only flaws in her case were her failure 
to explain her arrival from the islet, and the absence of her engagement ring; 
the only flaw in theirs was the appalling question 'Then where is Dolores?'</P>

<P>"Maddingley was of course at a complete standstill.&nbsp; He could only 
form one conclusion, that the whole family, including the girl, had entered 
into a conspiracy to lie.&nbsp; He washed his hands of the matter, and 
returned to Boston, where he angrily and rather foolishly opened his mind to 
the Press.</P>

<P>"Unfortunately, most of the friends of Dolores in Boston were entirely on 
the side of the family.&nbsp; Everyone admitted the astonishing physical 
resemblance; every one admitted the force of the fact that she knew every 
conceivable thing that Dolores had known; every one agreed that the 
disappearance of one girl to nowhere, concident with the arrival of an 
exactly similar girl from nowhere, was an unparalleled and incredible 
improbability.&nbsp; But they clung to their 'interior certainty' based on 
unavowable, impalpable, unconscious impression - for all the world like so 
many mystics!&nbsp; Mrs. Cass turned the imposter out of the cottage, after 
fitting her with an old dress; for the stranger was unquestionably wearing 
Dolores' bathing suit.&nbsp; And then she put up the shutters of the cottage, 
and went back to Boston.&nbsp; The family went into mourning, and refused to 
see any but the most intimate friends for the rest of the summer.</P>

<P>"The stranger found asylum with the proprietor of a sensational newspaper, 
who saw his way to exploit her.&nbsp; He had her psychoanalyzed, and tested 
in fifty different ways; her handwriting was photographed and enlarged - I may 
say that her bank cashed her first check without a word, and then went back on 
itself, refused to pay any more, but on the other hand refused to prosecute 
for forgery.&nbsp; She sued them; they put up a half-hearted fight, and she 
won handsomely.&nbsp; They hunted through the effects of the missing girl for 
fingerprints ... there was no end to it.</P>

<P>"Jenkins, of the 'Turkey-Buzzard', most certainly knew his business.&nbsp; 
He got experts from all over the country at loggerheads; he kept the whole 
of the United States in a turmoil for six months on end.&nbsp; It's still 
going on, fairly strong; safe for an argument in any gathering in the United 
States.&nbsp; The stranger's doing well, too; they say she stuck out for a 
thousand a week.&nbsp; And she's certainly earned it!&nbsp; That looks, by 
the way, as if she were not Dolores; for Dolores had all the money she 
needed.&nbsp; And Dolores wouldn't have given her family all that sorrow.&nbsp; 
No, if it's she, she must have one whale of a motive!"</P>

<P>"And what do you think?"</P>

<P>"I can't.&nbsp; I can't see what happened to the Dolores of the islet, 
unless they're all lying.&nbsp; And people don't turn out the best beloved for 
a joke; not people like the Cass family."</P>

<P>"Have you photographs?"</P>

<P>Miss Molly Madison promptly produced a docket.</P>

<P>"Nothing to go by, as I expected," grunted Simon Iff.&nbsp; "Yet - this is 
last week's - was it taken last week?"</P>

<P>"Surely.&nbsp; New dress; new pose.&nbsp; The Press has to keep up to date 
in this country!"</P>

<P>"Well, I suppose the best of us has a failing.&nbsp; This girl doesn't 
seem to be suffering as much as one would expect.&nbsp; She's got the 
anguished look, all right; but she hasn't lost much flesh since the fatal 
eighth of August."</P>

<P>"Oh, some people get fat on worry."</P>

<P>"Then you think it is Dolores, after all?"</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison was caught.&nbsp; She gave up.&nbsp; "Yes, I do; I 
think everybody does; only that makes the mystery more insoluble than ever."</P>

<P>"Then you think psychological difficulties are more serious than physical 
ones?"</P>

<P>"How you do pick one up!&nbsp; Yes, I suppose that's what I do think."</P>

<P>"My own course is simple.&nbsp; I will publish my solution.&nbsp; Or - 
wait - that's hardly fair.&nbsp; Was Dolores in love with Travis?'</P>

<P>"Very much.&nbsp; Friends and playmates from childhood; not another man in 
her life.&nbsp; We went through that with a toothcomb."</P>

<P>"Mr. Geoffrey Travis is not so faithful.&nbsp; He is engaged to be married 
to another girl."</P>

<P>"Impossible!&nbsp; He's heartbroken!"</P>

<P>"Ah, it's the double standard, I'm afraid!"</P>

<P>"I won't believe it of Geoffrey Travis."</P>

<P>"Well, you watch the papers.&nbsp; If there isn't an announcement to that 
effect in three days, you may come up here and get the box of gloves I'm 
betting you about it."</P>

<P>"Is it a joke?"</P>

<P>"Well, it is rather.&nbsp; Don't put it in your interview, though, or 
you'll spoil everything.&nbsp; But you may say that - er - I think I'll write 
it down for you; I want verbal accuracy in this one thing please.&nbsp; 'Mr. 
Iff said that the case showed clear evidence of certain influences connected 
with what is commonly and erroneously called the supernatural; and that he 
would publish a full analysis of the case in these columns, and in the 
Journals devoted to Psychical Research, in one month from date.'&nbsp; I think  
that will do.&nbsp; Only - don't put it in unless I'm wrong about Travis.&nbsp; 
So come up at four o'clock on Friday, and have tea, and we'll have another 
chat."</P>

<P>"You're as mysterious as the case itself."</P>

<P>"Just so," smiled Simon.&nbsp; "Quite plain sailing, if you think it 
out!"</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison sailed queenly out of the apartment, blessed above 
women in the possession of a number one 'scoop.'</P>

<P>Simon Iff called to his Jap to pack a bag.&nbsp; "I'll be back Thursday 
evening, at the latest," said he.</P>

<P>And on Thursday morning, Miss Mollie Madison, waking late after a hard 
night covering somebody's d&#233;but, opened her paper at the Society Column 
to read the formal announcement of the engagement of Mr. Geoffrey Travis to 
Miss Alberta Crosman of Philadelphia.</P>

<P>"How could he possibly know?" she wailed.&nbsp; "He is a magician; it is 
all supernatural!&nbsp; But oh! what a scoop! what a scoop!"</P>

<P>She made the world's record for a lady's toilet look like a basket of eggs 
dropped from the Woolworth Building, and reached the office to write up the 
prophecy just about the time when Simon Iff, sitting with Geoffrey Travis in 
his office in Boston, saw the door flung open and an impetuous young lady, 
with a really remarkable diamond on her business finger, burst in with the 
cry "Don't you dare, Geoffrey, don't you dare!"</P>

<P>By the men's faces she saw that she had been tricked; but she didn't mind 
much.&nbsp; Simon Iff slipped out, with a wave of the finger-tips.&nbsp; 
"Won't disturb you now; see you at the wedding."</P>

<P>"Don't forget you're the best man!" shouted Geoffrey, through the waves of 
loosened gold that flowed about his head.</P>

<P>It was with reverence and godly fear that Miss Mollie Madison knocked at 
the door of 'that uncanny old man' on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; She had just 
heard on long distance of the reappearance of the real Dolores, and Simon 
Iff's reference to the supernatural, which she had of course completely 
misunderstood, had set her imagination awhirl.</P>

<P>She was decidedly reassured to find him making the tea in a very fantastic 
and elaborate, but very practical manner, with one hand, and toasting muffins 
over a silver spirit lamp with the other.</P>

<P>"Welcome, my child!" he cried.&nbsp; "It may be you can lift the burden 
from my soul!"</P>

<P>She offered her utmost:&nbsp; what was the trouble?</P>

<P>"I despair of humanity," cried he.&nbsp; "I can trust no living creature 
either to make tea or to toast muffins, save myself.&nbsp; Yet they must be 
accomplished simultaneously, or all is lost!"&nbsp; He comically resigned the 
task to her.&nbsp; "You finish it!&nbsp; I must lament alone.&nbsp; I am 
getting old.&nbsp; The appalling castastrophe in the Pasquaney Puzzle has 
ruined my last hope for Man!"</P>

<P>"Why, haven't you heard?" she said, aglow.&nbsp; "The real Dolores has 
come back this morning."</P>

<P>"I was there," said Simon.&nbsp; "Pour out the tea, and I will declare to 
you this mystery.&nbsp; But I will declare it decently and in order:&nbsp; 
the castastrophe whereof I speak will therefore come last."</P>

<P>"I love being teased."</P>

<P>"It was evident from the first that the family was not lying.&nbsp; A joke 
might have been well enough for a day or a week, though a highbred Baastan 
clan is the last place on earth - if Baaston can be said to be on earth - to 
look for it.&nbsp; It is unthinkable that they should keep it up for six 
months and more.&nbsp; One might have explained the mere disappearance of 
Dolores by supposing that the two girls were lying for some strong motive, but 
that would involve a Second Girl, with all the difficulties attached to that 
theory.&nbsp; It was pretty clear to me that the Casses were absolutely 
honest, and absolutely bewildered.</P>

<P>"It followed that Dolores herself was the mainspring of the mechanism.&nbsp; 
She could not have been drowned in the shallow water of a calm lake within a 
few yards of her sisters; she could not have been kidnapped.&nbsp; No; she was 
the creator of the plot.</P>

<P>"Now then, we have to find a motive for her action.&nbsp; Here is a 
high-minded and noble girl, without a care in the world, loved and loving.&nbsp; 
We must exclude any idea of scandal or even of escapade.&nbsp; She was a jolly 
happy girl.&nbsp; But she had more in her than that; and that was not any 
secret passion or vice.&nbsp; It was an intense ambition to follow her father 
to an equal fame.&nbsp; She put in every spare moment on the higher 
mathematics or on the problems of psychical research.</P>

<P>"I said to myself that a very strong motive must be attached to this - er - 
I believe the Baaston for it is Urge.</P>

<P>"And then I saw instantly a quite inexplicable coincidence.&nbsp; You told 
me of her 'profound study of spirit return'.&nbsp; The crux of that problem 
is proof of identity.&nbsp; And the Pasquaney Puzzle is just such a 
problem.&nbsp; It was impossible to doubt that Dolores had deliberately 
invented a test case, and challenged all the wise men of the world to solve 
it.&nbsp; She knew well enough that the notoriety would attract every 
intelligence on the planet, if she only gave them time enough.&nbsp; It would 
not do to give the game away in a week or a month.</P>

<P>"No scandal would be attached to the family, once her motive was made 
clear by the publication of a thesis analysing the evidence in the case.</P>

<P>"Her action would cause extreme pain to those she loved; but science 
first!&nbsp; She would atone by the distinction of her achievement.&nbsp; At 
twenty-two one has such ideas.</P>

<P>"So far, so good; but how did such an idea arise in her mind?&nbsp; 
Possibly long ago, as an A. B. case; but if so, she must have seen immediately 
that it was perfectly impracticable.&nbsp; In what conceivable set of 
circumstances could she get her mother and sisters and brother and lover and 
friends to disown her?&nbsp; By some change of manner?&nbsp; Some assumed 
forgetfulness of her identity?&nbsp; They would merely have supposed her ill 
or insane; no public controversy could ever have arisen.&nbsp; No:&nbsp; the 
only plan would be to have a Second Girl; and my idea is that she found the 
Second Girl first, and that the likeness put the scheme into her head.</P>

<P>"Just then a flash of memory came to assist me.&nbsp; I met Professor Cass 
several times in Europe.&nbsp; He was just such a man as I imagine Dolores to 
be a woman.&nbsp; He would go to any lengths in the interest of his work.&nbsp; 
He once nearly killed himself in an experiment with digitalis and hyoscine - 
he wanted to map out the conflicting curves in the record of his heart action 
produced by those drugs.&nbsp; And as for some reason or other he couldn't 
bring Mrs. Cass on his travels, and as he 'couldn't work without her 
inspiration', he simply contracted a liaison with a woman as much like her as 
possible!&nbsp; It occurred to me that some such union had been fruitful, and 
that Dolores, by accident or design, had met a half-sister on the trip to 
Europe, two years ago, of which you told me.</P>

<P>"Now suppose that this half-sister, or some other girl equally well 
qualified, agrees to the suggestion of Dolores.&nbsp; They must first put in a 
great deal of work, prompting the Second Girl in family knowledge, teaching 
her to imitate Dolores' handwriting, and so on; and they must then invent a 
dramatic quick change scene, if possible one so extraordinary as to exclude 
all trickery - except The Trick.&nbsp; Dolores had made a special study of 
this with her 'mediums'.&nbsp; She thought of the summer cottage, and an 
excellent idea came to her.&nbsp; She would learn to swim like a fish, and 
keep up the pretence of being a duffer.&nbsp; I suspected something of that 
sort from the first minute - the statement of her incompetence was as weak as 
negatives usually are - especially in spiritualistic circles.&nbsp; When a man 
begins to argue that a medium couldn't know this or couldn't do that, he's 
either an expert or an ignoramus; and he's rarely an expert.</P>

<P>"She would need one further essential, and co-operation of somebody 
powerful, somebody who could hide the Second Girl until the right moment, and 
arrange for her own getaway and concealment while the play was playing.&nbsp; 
Probably she knew already of some people of wealth, deeply interested in the 
spirit problem, who would join the merry throng.</P>

<P>"I could not see any other solution that was not barred either by the 
psychology or by the physics of the known facts."</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison had got it all down in her note book.&nbsp; As Simon 
Iff was now politely offering her a cigarette, she decided to ask what she 
wanted to know.&nbsp; Analysis and deduction were nothing in her young life; 
but how did 'that uncanny old man' prophesy the engagement of Geoffry Travis, 
whose name he had just heard for the first time?</P>

<P>"I'm a vain old person, my dear; I ought to have let well alone.&nbsp; But 
I'm still young enough to be annoyed that a chit of a girl should think to 
puzzle me, even if she merely includes me in Carlyle's 'mostly fools'.&nbsp; 
So I determined to twist my knuckles in the golden locks of Miss Dolores and 
drag her to my wigwam.&nbsp; Therefore I arranged with you - as a last 
resort - to publish that I would deal with the matter from the point of view 
of Psychical Research.&nbsp; She would see the point at once, of course.&nbsp; 
Her Press-Cutting people must be keeping her supplied with all possible 
material for her book.&nbsp; She would know my name, I hoped, and know from 
that notice that I knew the whole story, and meant to take the wind out of her 
sails by publishing my own analysis of the identity problem before she had got 
hers ready.&nbsp; In which case, good-bye to her fame, to the whole purpose of 
her plot.</P>

<P>"But alas for humanity!&nbsp; I bethought me also of a simple plan, a plan 
which would humiliate her even more before me.&nbsp; I would tell Travis my 
conclusions, and end:&nbsp; 'If you want her back, you've only got to 
advertise that you've got a new girl now.'&nbsp; So, as I said before - and 
Shakespeare even earlier! - that bait of falsehood took that carp of 
truth.&nbsp; She came round in a rage the next morning, and delivered the 
goods.&nbsp; To think that one whose aspiration soared so high should fall so 
low!&nbsp; 'Tis vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself, and falls on the 
other!&nbsp; To aim at mathematics and to hit mere man!"</P>

<P>"Oh how wonderful you are, Mr. Iff!&nbsp; How you know the Heart of a Pure 
Woman!"</P>

<P>"Oh no, my dear, it's not original at all; it's just a modern adaptation 
of Solomon and the Baby.&nbsp; And now I have to run away and dress for 
dinner; you may publish all I've said, except the bit about the 
half-sister.&nbsp; Just invent a marvellous coincidence, won't you?&nbsp; It's 
the crucial difficulty of the whole business, but nobody will know that.&nbsp; 
So run away, little girl, run away and play with your nice toy, the 
Public!"</P>
