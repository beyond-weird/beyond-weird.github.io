Sterilized 
Stephen</h2></CENTER>

<P>"Take an arm-chair, young lady," said Simon Iff genially.&nbsp; "Every man 
and every woman is a star.&nbsp; Dobson, tell Nankipoo to bring the drinks 
and gaspers."</P>

<P>The woman addressed sank into a chair rather than took it.&nbsp; She 
covered her face with her hands and began to wipe away the tears with a  
corner of her ragged gawdy skirt.&nbsp; Iff scrutinized her in silence.</P>

<P>"Explain the Law," said he when Dobson returned from his errand.&nbsp; 
"After that, leave us alone."</P>

<P>"It's this way," said the chauffeur, "as I understand it.&nbsp; Mr. Iff 
says that we are all really sort of gods who have disguised ourselves as men 
and women for the sake of the experience; and life on earth is always so 
painful and hideous that we are all first-class heroes simply for getting 
ourselves born.&nbsp; We ought all to respect each other for what we really 
are and for what we have done.&nbsp; It doesn't make any odds what particular 
rig we've got ourselves up in.&nbsp; Sit up and smile, lass, and talk to Mr. 
Iff as if he were your own twin brother."</P>

<P>"That'll do, Dobson," said Mr. Iff; "I am her own twin brother."</P>

<P>The girl lifted her head.&nbsp; The bitter years had taught her to read 
strange men at a glance.&nbsp; She saw respect and sympathy in the magician's 
face.&nbsp; There was no hint of patronage or anything else that could wound 
the most sensitive spirit.&nbsp; She smiled timidly.&nbsp; Dobson left the 
room as the Japanese servant served the refreshments.</P>

<P>"Not bad stuff.&nbsp; May I fill your glass again?"</P>

<P>The girl nodded.&nbsp; The stimulant had given her courage.</P>

<P>"Righto," said Simon, "tell me the whole trouble, Young un."</P>

<P>She began to stammer--"I don't know how I'm here," she managed to get out 
at last.</P>

<P>Iff answered her.&nbsp; "Simple enough, my dear.&nbsp; It's one of Dobson's 
duties to keep his eyes open for beauty in distress.&nbsp; Whenever he spots 
any one in need of any kind, he helps them out; and if he finds the job beyond 
him he brings the business to me."</P>

<P>"I thought he was your chauffeur," said the girl, as if the magician's 
statement were somewhat surprising.</P>

<P>"So he is," cried Iff.&nbsp; "But then, what is a chauffeur? Doesn't the 
word mean one who warms things up? He saw you shivering in the cold world.&nbsp; 
That's all."</P>

<P>She still seemed puzzled.&nbsp; Simon sighed.</P>

<P>"Alas, I see that you have been taught to think of a servant as somehow 
inferior to his master.&nbsp; Dobson is my colleague, a star whose business 
happens to be to shove another star along the streets."</P>

<P>The wine was beginning to work in the girl.&nbsp; She began to recover from 
the obsession of her surroundings.&nbsp; She had never imagined the 
possibility of so gorgeous a room as Iff's.&nbsp; The sober splendour 
frightened her.&nbsp; She connected it instinctively with wealth and power,  
and to her wealth and power meant only the hidden horror behind the 
police--that monster, many-armed, that might pounce upon her at any moment 
without reason and without warning.</P>

<P>"What kind of a star am I?" she asked, and trembled at her own audacity.</P>

<P>"It's my business to find out," said he; "to find out why you happen to be 
in this particular disguise; to put you on your proper course; to free you 
from the forces which have dragged you off it."</P>

<P>She shook her head very slowly and sadly but with decision.</P>

<P>Iff eyed her narrowly.</P>

<P>She sat up straight, gripping the arms of her chair.&nbsp; There was 
something like a sneer on her lips, something like contempt in her voice.</P>

<P>"Looking for lost sheep? That game's no good.&nbsp; I'm a goat, and you 
can't get mutton from me."</P>

<P>"Great," cried Iff.&nbsp; "That's the spirit I like.&nbsp; I'm a bit of a 
goat myself.&nbsp; Goats will be goats.&nbsp; Did you ever hear what one of 
the greatest poets and prophets that ever lived said about goats? 'The lust of 
the goat is the glory of God.'"</P>

<P>The girl's animation increased.&nbsp; It was a new experience for her to 
be addressed by an apparently respectable member of society except in one of 
three ways:&nbsp; either it was the coarse familiarity of casual admirers, the 
sanctimonious severity of professional philanthropists, or the savage menaces 
of the police.&nbsp; Iff understood.</P>

<P>"Why the hell should I want to reform you?" he laughed.&nbsp; "I suppose 
you've had a streak of bad luck.&nbsp; I prescribe a new dress, a new hat, 
some gloves, and silk stockings with change of scenery.&nbsp; I admit that 
8th Avenue, with all its charms, may seem monotonous in the long run.&nbsp; 
Help yourself," he concluded, tossing his bill-fold into her lap.&nbsp; "Try 
what the Board Walk will do for you."</P>

<P>To his surprise, the girl sprang up as if his action had broken some spell 
that had bound her.&nbsp; She crossed the room like a queen, and handed back 
the case.&nbsp; Then she burst into a torrent of tears which shook her slight 
shoulders with tempestuous violence.</P>

<P>Simon Iff took her back to her chair and soothed her.&nbsp; As soon as she 
was calm, he spoke with curt authority.</P>

<P>"Tell me the whole trouble."</P>

<P>His tone made her mistress of herself.</P>

<P>"All Morgan's millions wouldn't help me--you don't understand.&nbsp; How 
could you? I've been sick, I've starved, I've been in gaol! I haven't a 
friend--I've nothing before me but death--I'm sliding; no one can save me.&nbsp; 
I con't want to be saved.&nbsp; Thanks for the money--at least for the thought 
in your heart.&nbsp; But a glimpse of joy would only make my wretchedness 
harder to bear.&nbsp; I haven't cried for five years."</P>

<P>The natural question shot through Simon's mouth.&nbsp; "Then why were you 
crying to-day?"</P>

<P>"Not for myself--I'm too hard and too proud.&nbsp; Look at this paper."</P>

<P>Her trembling hands fumbled in a shabby plush bag.&nbsp; She handed a slip 
torn from the columns of an "Evening Journal" to Simon.&nbsp; It was a police 
report.&nbsp; It recorded the conviction of Stephen Adams, aged 23, assistant 
cashier in the office of a well-known firm of stockbrokers.&nbsp; The charge 
was 'theft' of a number of Liberty Bonds.&nbsp; Few details were given; but 
the method of the robbery had been the abstraction of a number of bonds from 
a packet, detection having been postponed by replacing them by 
Bolshevic-manufactured forgeries.&nbsp; The sentence had been Draconic.&nbsp; 
Even the employers had asked mercy on the ground of the boy's previously good 
character, and the element of doubt as to his guilt caused by the failure of 
the prosecution to trace either the disposal of the stolen goods, or the way 
in which the Russian bonds came into his possession.</P>

<P>But the judge was 'determined to stamp out that sort of thing', and put on 
his heaviest boots.</P>

<P>Simon returned the paper to his guest with a gesture of inquiry.</P>

<P>"Stephen's my brother," she said.</P>

<P>"And you are very fond of each other?" asked Iff.</P>

<P>She hung her head dejectedly.&nbsp; "He cast me off when I went wrong.&nbsp; 
I haven't seen him since."</P>

<P>Iff's respect for the girl increased once more.&nbsp; Why should she take 
so much to heart the punishment of the Pharisee? Her intuition read his 
thought.</P>

<P>"I was like a mother to Stephen," she murmured.&nbsp; "I'm seven years 
older.&nbsp; Mother died when he was born, and father two years later.&nbsp; 
Aunt Dorcas, his sister, brought us up.&nbsp; She did her best for us both.&nbsp; 
She was ever so kind; but dreadfully strict.&nbsp; I was always bad at heart, 
I'm afraid.&nbsp; I wanted my own way, and it brought me to what I am.&nbsp; 
But he was a dandy kid, clever and good as any one could possibly be.&nbsp; 
He seemed to take naturally to all her ideas.&nbsp; He was the model boy of 
the whole town.&nbsp; I'm sorry to say, I despised him for his goodness.&nbsp; 
I thought he was a sissy; maybe that's why I mothered him so much.&nbsp; I was 
20 when Aunt Dorcas died.&nbsp; She left us all she had--it wasn't much, just 
over $2,000.&nbsp; We stayed on in the flat.&nbsp; Stephen finished his 
schooling; but I couldn't send him to college, though he was such a splendid 
scholar and took heaps of prizes.&nbsp; I might have worked it if I hadn't run 
wild.&nbsp; But as soon as I found myself free, I was like a crazy thing, and 
before I knew it I had gone wrong with a boy who came down our way fishing for 
the summer.&nbsp; He knew all the tricks.&nbsp; When he knew what he had done, 
he wouldn't marry me, but he sent me to a wicked doctor.&nbsp; I was sick for 
a long while, and somehow they found out in the town what my trouble was.&nbsp; 
When I tried to get back to my old job, I was thrown out.&nbsp; It was the 
same everywhere.&nbsp; I came to New York and begged my boy to be decent; to 
help me out about Stephen.&nbsp; He got him a job in his father's office.</P>

<P>"As for me, he was tired of my troubles.&nbsp; He wanted pleasure without 
paying for it.&nbsp; I got work, and found it wouldn't keep me from 
starving.&nbsp; I and another girl decided to do the usual thing.&nbsp; We 
went for the high lights on Broadway; and year after year we were driven 
further and further to skulk in the shadows."</P>

<P>She swallowed a lump in her throat.&nbsp; Iff seemed to be looking, not at 
her, but beyond her.&nbsp; His eyes glowed with angry bitterness.&nbsp; He 
was thinking of the stupidity of society.</P>

<P>"Don't you feel any resentment against your brother?" he asked tonelessly.</P>

<P>"Why should I? I'm proud that he is good.&nbsp; He's right to disown me."</P>

<P>"It seems that we are likely to quarrel," snorted Iff.&nbsp; "I prefer your 
career to his.&nbsp; You only obeyed your nature:&nbsp; your misfortunes come 
from other people's meanness, while Stephen, with every chance in his favour, 
turned thief and stole so stupidly that I haven't a spark of sympathy for him; 
his virtues make him viler."</P>

<P>The woman flared up in fury.&nbsp; "But he isn't guilty," she shouted, 
"how dare you?"</P>

<P>Iff was impressed.&nbsp; "I suppose you are so sure of him because you know 
him so well.&nbsp; But let me tell you that it never surprises me to find 
puritanically virtuous people coming a cropper, especially when they prefer 
their respectability to natural human feelings."</P>

<P>She remembered a good many similar cases.&nbsp; Her faith staggered for a 
moment, and then asserted itself with augmented certainty.</P>

<P>"Not Stephen," she cried.&nbsp; "He was always genuinely good.&nbsp; He 
never had the idea of revolt."</P>

<P>"My dear girl!" said Iff, "I admire you tremendously, but can't you see 
that you are simply arguing against yourself? Stephen, as you describe him, 
is simply a straw man, a weakling with no will of his own.&nbsp; Temptation 
would knock him over like a ninepin."</P>

<P>"Oh, how I wish I could show you how wrong you are! He wasn't merely 
obedient, he loved goodness for its own sake.&nbsp; He was active and eager 
to be better than he was asked to be.&nbsp; You know how dirty boys are; they 
seem to enjoy mud.&nbsp; Stephen could never endure a speck of dust on his 
clothes.&nbsp; His linen, his hands, his shoes--you couldn't have found dirt 
on them with a microscope.&nbsp; A boy can't do that just by passive trying 
to please.&nbsp; After Aunt Dorcas died, instead of getting slack and being 
influenced by my own carelessness, he got almost crazy about keeping himself 
clean.&nbsp; He read lots of learned books about germs.&nbsp; He was always 
disinfecting everything, from saucepans to doorknobs.&nbsp; He wouldn't kiss 
me for fear of germs.&nbsp; He always wore gloves, even at night, because of 
the story in a Sunday paper about the danger of infection from finger-nails.&nbsp; 
He was a joke in the office--they called him Sterilized Stephen."</P>

<P>Simon Iff had been twisting his mouth as if a curious flavour had touched 
it.&nbsp; He cleared his throat as he rose from his chair.</P>

<P>"Look here, young woman," he said, standing over her, "I doubt very much 
whether your sublime confidence amounts to anything; but you interest me 
enormously, and so does Stephen in a rather whimsical fashion.&nbsp; I'll 
look into the case for you and do what I can; but don't be silly enough to 
hope too much.&nbsp; Don't worry yourself, face the facts.&nbsp; Believe in 
yourself.&nbsp; Take these bills from Stephen's brother and yours; trot off 
to Atlantic City and let the breezes have a chance at your lungs.&nbsp; Come  
back here in a week and perhaps I may have something to tell you."</P>

<P>He jotted down the name and that of the Brokers'; and took her to the door 
himself.&nbsp; They shook hands.&nbsp; Her grasp was so steady and so firm 
that he felt, in spite of himself, that her faith was something more than the 
passionate protest of the bigot against the blasphemer who overthrows his 
idol.</P>

<P><CENTER>II</CENTER></P>

<P>The next morning, Simon Iff called on the stockbrokers.&nbsp; Mr. Lubeck, 
the senior partner, was a middle-aged man whose natural kindness of heart had 
not been destroyed by the racket of the Street.&nbsp; He shook his head when 
Iff explained his errand.&nbsp; It was evident that he thought it quixotic.&nbsp; 
But Stephen Adams had been a special favourite, and Lubeck would have done 
much more to restore his belief in the boy than Iff required.&nbsp; He 
explained the circumstances briefly and clearly.</P>

<P>"Adams worked in a compartment shut off from the main office, with the 
cashier Hobbs, who had been twenty years with the firm, and another assistant; 
Jackson, of about Stephen's own age.&nbsp; On the day of the theft, Jackson 
had been abscent--suffering from influenza.&nbsp; A packet of bonds had been 
handed to Adams that he might inscribe their numbers in the appropriate 
register.&nbsp; He was then to hand the packet to the messanger for delivery 
to the customer, after having placed them in an envelope and sealed them.&nbsp; 
The bonds were handed to Adams at exactly a quarter to twelve.&nbsp; They had 
been carefully checked by one of the partners on taking them from the safe, 
and examined by another partner.&nbsp; Both were absolutely sure that none of 
the bonds were forgeries.&nbsp; The forged bonds, incidentally, were poor 
imitations; besides which, all dealers had been warned by the Treasury that 
systematic attempts were being made to circulate them.&nbsp; Everybody was in 
consequence very much on his guard.&nbsp; It is thus certain that Adams had 
received the genuine bonds, and moreover, he had entered the numbers 
conformably to the record of the bank which had issued them.</P>

<P>"Adams had himself sealed the package, and handed it to the messenger, who 
had locked it up at once in this satchel, and gone straight to the 
customer.&nbsp; This latter had taken the envelope at once to his bank, where 
the cashier broke the seals, and discovered at once that all the bonds except 
two, those at the top and the bottom; were forgeries.&nbsp; The bank 
telephoned to Lubeck*, who called in the police.&nbsp; It was proved that 
nobody had entered the cashier's office except Hobbs, who had been out on 
some errand, in the building, and darted hurriedly in for his hat and coat, 
and out again in less than half a minute.&nbsp; His haste had indeed 
attracted general notice.&nbsp; Detectives found him at his usual restaurant 
talking volubly and excitedly to a friend.&nbsp; He explained his unusual 
conduct as due to sudden and severe trouble in his family; enquiry confirmed 
his statements.&nbsp; He had no discoverable financial anxieties, and was an 
old and trusted servant of the firm.&nbsp; It was not possible for him to 
have substituted the forged bonds in full view of Adams who was actually 
engaged upon them.&nbsp; Hobbs swore that in his hurry he had taken no 
particular notice of what Adams was doing--yet he was conscious of a vague 
impression that his sudden entry startled his assistant, and that there was a 
sort of shuffling among the papers.</P>

<P>"Adams had gone to lunch immediately after handing the packet to the 
messenger.&nbsp; The clerks noticed that his face was grey as if with fear, 
and that his hands were trembling.</P>

<P>"He returned an hour later, still agitated, as if he had partially failed 
to conjure the peril that awaited him.&nbsp; He had spent the hour, not at  
lunch, but in a crazy dash up town to the boarding-house, where he had stayed 
less than ten minutes.</P>

<P>"It being physically impossible for any other person to have committed the 
theft, he was tackled outright.&nbsp; He met the charge with stubborn 
denial.&nbsp; He admitted the logic of the situation fearlessly and 
firmly.&nbsp; He confessed that he could not suggest any alternative to the 
obvious conclusion.&nbsp; But he stuck stoutly to his statement.&nbsp; It was 
very striking to observe that his agitation ceased instantly when he heard the 
accusation.&nbsp; He was frightfully pale, but the calmest man in the 
office.&nbsp; 'I can't excuse it; I can't explain it.&nbsp; I didn't do 
it.&nbsp; It's beyond imagination.&nbsp; I am in the hands of God.'&nbsp; They 
walked him off on those words."</P>

<P>Simon Iff mused awhile over this story.&nbsp; He recognized, despite the 
wide divergence of form, the almost fanatical faith and firmness of the 
sister in that of the brother.&nbsp; Her integrity in her infamy was the same 
as his in his innocence; and the certainty of her candour as a sinner induced 
him to put confidence in his as a saint!</P>

<P>"This is your first robbery; by the way?"</P>

<P>"Why, no!" cried Lubeck suddenly troubled, without quite knowing why.&nbsp;  
We've had more than I care to think about, right along for years and years.&nbsp; 
The fact is, Mr. Iff, I'm what they call an easy mark.&nbsp; I like to trust 
people; Wall Street is wasted on me.&nbsp; I can't seem to learn sense--the 
truth is, I guess, that I won't.&nbsp; I'd sooner be a sucker than sour on 
humanity."</P>

<P>"Mr. Lubeck," said Iff, his eyes very bright, "you're a pretty good man of 
business, from my point of view.&nbsp; You've had the good sense not to sell 
your soul to save a few dollars; the power to love and trust is a man's best 
asset when he balances the books of his life."</P>

<P>"That's about the way I feel," returned the broker, simply.&nbsp; "Do you  
see any way out for Stephen? I'd give more than a cancelled coupon this hadn't 
happened."</P>

<P>"May I look at the office?"</P>

<P>"Sure; this way."</P>

<P>"Don't hope enough to hurt yourself," Iff warned him; "I can't see one 
spark.&nbsp; Yet I feel a sort of feeble flutter somewhere as if something 
might turn up.&nbsp; Is that the scene of the crime?"</P>

<P>"Yep," answered Lubeck, his hand on the knob of the door.</P>

<P>They went in.&nbsp; Hobbs and Jackson were busy on the books; they stood 
up respectfully as their employer appeared.</P>

<P>Iff swept the room with his glance.&nbsp; Its walls and roof were of opaque 
glass, framed in varnished oak.&nbsp; All was spotless and orderly, from the 
desks to the safe.&nbsp; There was no way to enter the room save the one door; 
the window had not even a sill, and open on a sheer smooth wall ninety feet 
above Broadway.</P>

<P>Lubeck, following his guest's eyes, volunteered that on the day of the 
theft the window had been closed, as a bitter wind was blowing, with sleet.</P>

<P>"Not a place for a rabbit to hide," remarked the broker, sadly.</P>

<P>"Unless in some conjurer's hat," laughed Simon, touching a 'Derby' that 
hung from a peg behind the door.&nbsp; A thought seemed to strike him; his 
eyes darted from the hat to the two men.</P>

<P>The second hat was of soft felt, old and much worn, but well kept, while 
the 'Derby,' though nearly new, bore marks of grease.&nbsp; One might have 
fancied it begging to be brushed.</P>

<P>There was no need to enquire which of the men owned it.&nbsp; Jackson was 
dressed in shabby shoddy; it shone where the nap had been rubbed smooth.&nbsp; 
But the trousers had been carefully pressed, and the cuffs of the cheap 
cotton shirt were protected by paper.</P>

<P>Hobbs, on the contrary, with far better clothes, was careless about 
them.&nbsp; His whole appearance was that of some eccentric recluse, too much 
absorbed in study to pay attention to externals.</P>

<P>Lubeck introduced him as the best cashier in 'little old New York.'&nbsp; 
"He lives for his work; we have to wake him up to go home."</P>

<P>Iff recognized the eyes of an enthusiast; the man evidently itched to get 
back to his books.&nbsp; But the magician was not interested in the merits of 
Hobbs; he was looking for something out of the common, something that nobody 
had noticed.&nbsp; A trifle might tell him more than a treatise, just as the 
almost imperceptible aberration of a planet indicates some invisible influence 
more significant than all the rest of its orbit.</P>

<P>There was only one object in the office which seemed superfluous in that  
ideally efficient and economical arrangement.&nbsp; Everything was planned for 
three people, from the chairs and the telephone to the blotters and the 
hat-pegs.&nbsp; The third man being out, the third peg was vacant; and Iff, 
as he mentally recorded this instance of the fitness of things, was reminded 
of a minute matter that meant nothing, that had not aroused any augmented 
attention.&nbsp; In a recess of the wall near the window there was a fourth 
hat-peg.&nbsp; Simon swerved sharply from the door, and inspected this 
intrusive superfluity that insulted the three-ness of the furniture.&nbsp; He 
pointed an enquiring finger at it as he noted that it looked newer than its 
rivals for the rapture of being garnished with headgear and overcoats.</P>

<P>He heard Hobbs chuckle, and Jackson giggle, over his shoulder.</P>

<P>"A painful subject," said the cashier.&nbsp; "I hate to think of it.&nbsp; 
That hook was put up to humour a fad of poor old 'Sterilized Stephen.'&nbsp; 
I guess you've heard the story.&nbsp; Goldurn it, I'd give a month's pay to 
think we all got it wrong."</P>

<P>Jackson was angry with himself for having laughed, and murmured something 
about how horrible was temptation.</P>

<P>"Temptation, hell," growled Hobbs, "must have known he'd be spotted 
straight off.&nbsp; My belief is he went plumb crazy, didn't know what he was 
doing.&nbsp; Seems to me that fool fad of his about dirt and germs was a sign 
he had bats in his belfry.&nbsp; Wouldn't hang his things up with ours, what 
d'ye know about that?"</P>

<P>Simon Iff had turned to face the speaker.</P>

<P>"Mr. Hobbs, let me thank you most heartily for your remarks.&nbsp; I 
believe in my soul that you have thrown very full light on the case.&nbsp;  
I must go off now--but I hope to see you again very soon--perhaps to thank 
you for helping me to get an innocent lad out of prison."</P>

<P>Five minutes later, Simon Iff was on his way to apply for a permit to visit 
the convicted cashier.</P>

<P><CENTER>III</CENTER></P>

<P>It was three days later when the magician stepped from his automobile 
across the threshold of the gaol where Stephen Adams was serving the first 
weeks of his sentence.&nbsp; He had taken unusual pains with his toilet.&nbsp; 
"Mollie, my dear, I must look as if I had sprung out of a bandbox," he had 
insisted, and Mollie had been made to assure him over and over, with the most 
terrific oaths, that she had removed the last obstinate staphylococcus from 
the last square millimetre of his coat.</P>

<P>His first act was to hand the governor of the prison an order to permit an 
investigation of the mental condition of the convict Stephen Adams.&nbsp; "It 
would be charming if you and the prison doctor would agree to witness my 
little experiment," he purred, "it's a bit out of the usual line."&nbsp; The 
governor assented cordially enough, and sent for the medical officer.&nbsp; 
The three men found Adams in his cell.&nbsp; He appeared exhausted as if by 
severe mental strain, but stood up readily enough at the summons.</P>

<P>"I prefer not to explain the object of my enquiry at present," began Iff; 
"I merely beg that you gentlemen will make careful notes of the prisoner's 
reactions to what I say or do."</P>

<P>He then approached the convict, and began a conversation with him, cheerful 
in tone, and trivial in subject.&nbsp; As he talked he made violent gestures, 
touching the boy several times.&nbsp; Once he dropped his note book; it was 
instantly picked up and returned to him.&nbsp; After some ten minutes of this, 
Iff turned suddenly to the witnesses, and asked if they had remarked anything 
unusual.&nbsp; Both shook their heads.&nbsp; They seemed surprised that Iff 
showed no disappointment.</P>

<P>"Perfectly sane? Perfectly normal?" Iff asked.</P>

<P>"As any of us."</P>

<P>"Quite perfect," came the answers.</P>

<P>"Every faculty in full free function?"</P>

<P>"Certainly," the governor nodded.</P>

<P>"Much above the average all around," affirmed the doctor.</P>

<P>Iff turned again to the prisoner, and resumed the thread of his previous 
remarks.&nbsp; His manner was in all respects unchanged; yet after a few 
seconds Stephen started back, as if he had received a blow.&nbsp; His face 
paled; his eyes glared in horror; he shrank back trembling from the magician 
as if he saw a ghost.&nbsp; He struggled to answer Iff's questions, but did 
so at random, either misunderstanding what was said or replying 
irrationally.&nbsp; The magician worried him twice round the cell, and then 
left him shuddering in a corner.&nbsp; He next proceeded to execute a 
fantastic war-dance, with howls, ending in a double somersault.&nbsp; He then 
returned to the door, and requested the doctor to ask Adams to describe what 
had taken place.</P>

<P>The convict made a powerful effort to control himself.&nbsp; As he spoke, 
he recovered little by little.&nbsp; He gave a more or less connected account 
of the conversation, but omitted to report the majority of Iff's actions.&nbsp; 
The doctor prompting him, he acknowledged with apologies that he had "somehow 
forgotten;" but he denied positively that the final dance had ever taken 
place.</P>

<P>The officials signalled their bewilderment.</P>

<P>"What does it mean?" cried the governor.</P>

<P>"May I tell you in your room?"</P>

<P>The governor nodded; the visitors retired, Iff waving his hand to the 
prisoner, and bidding him count confidently on being out in a month at most.</P>

<P>"First of all, gentlemen," said Simon Iff, settling himself in a huge 
leather chair, "I may assume that you have no doubts as to the genuineness of 
the behaviour of that boy?"</P>

<P>"Barring your having put him up to it, which is absurd, it's impossible.&nbsp; 
It would be senseless."</P>

<P>"He had no idea of your object," chimed in the governor:&nbsp; "nor, for 
that matter, have we!"</P>

<P>"Next," pursued Simon.&nbsp; "Will you please examine me closely? Am I in 
any way altered since I was last in this room?"</P>

<P>Inspection gave negative results.</P>

<P>"Tut," cried Iff, "your old gaol wants a wash! Just look at my coat! These 
cuffs were clean this morning! How did that spot get on my shirt? My nails 
are simply disgraceful!"</P>

<P>"Search me," laughed one, to conceal his sense of shame.</P>

<P>"Modern psychology offers numerous alternative explanations of the 
phenomenon," pronounced the other, to smoke-screen his ignorance.</P>

<P>"All I ask you to do is to write a report of the facts as you saw them, 
and send it to the District Attorney.&nbsp; You'll hear the results in a few 
days--excuse me, won't you now.&nbsp; I'm hot on a trail, and ever so many 
thanks for your kindness and assistance."</P>

<P>He bowed and smiled himself out of the gaol, and told Dobson to 'step on 
it' all the way back to Gotham.&nbsp; A telephone call secured him the company 
of Mr. Lubeck at dinner, where he proposed a programme which pleased, even 
while it puzzled, the kind-hearted old broker.</P>

<P><CENTER>IV</CENTER></P>

<P>Stephen's sister came back from Atlantic City with colour in her cheeks 
instead of on them; Simon Iff wasted no time in telling her the results of 
his week's work.</P>

<P>"The hard half has been done, my dear; we know Stephen didn't do it, and 
we know who did.&nbsp; We know how it was done, what's more; and for that we 
must blame--you'll never guess--your Aunt Dorcas!"</P>

<P>"Aunt Dorcas!" echoed the girl blankly.</P>

<P>"Nobody else.&nbsp; Let me tell you the whole story as it happened.&nbsp; 
Here's a boy, kept away from danger (damn the fools) till he is afraid of 
every mortal thing he hears or sees.&nbsp; It's sin or sickness, hell or 
hospital, lying in ambush for everything he does! He is never allowed a chance 
to find out for himself that most of these horrors are bogies.&nbsp; He never 
faces his fears; they occupy his whole outlook; he devotes himself heart and 
soul to dodging them.&nbsp; As it happens, he reads a lot of exaggerated 
rubbish about germs, and his mind is obsessed about them.&nbsp; He becomes 
'Sterilized Stephen.'&nbsp; The approach of 'infection' terrifies him clean 
out of his wits, so that he is unable to see what is in front of his eyes.&nbsp; 
A cowardly thief is cunning enough to make a plan to take advantage of this.&nbsp; 
He threatens to touch the boy with some unusually dirty object, knowing that 
his senses will be paralysed with fear; while Stephen is in this state, he 
substitutes forged bonds for genuine in the packet on the desk.&nbsp; Your 
brother sees nothing; ten seconds, and the thief is away.&nbsp; Stephen picks 
himself up still dazed, with no thought, no reason to think, to examine the 
bonds.&nbsp; He seals up the packet..."</P>

<P>The girl's teeth were clenched with rage; her breath came hissing through 
them.</P>

<P>"But why did he bolt uptown?" she asked as Iff paused.</P>

<P>"I suppose he went to his coat for some patent disinfectant he favoured--and 
that the thief had stolen it, judging that Stephen would rush home for more.&nbsp; 
He's a good psychologist, the skunk; it all panned out according to schedule."</P>

<P>"How can I ever thank you--I feel frightfully bad about it."</P>

<P>"Nothing done yet, my dear, I'm sorry to say.&nbsp; The last half looks a 
pretty tough proposition.&nbsp; It's not a soft job to put one over on friend 
Hobbs--and that's where you come in!"</P>

<P>"I? How?" cried the startled girl.</P>

<P><CENTER>V</CENTER></P>

<P>The gift--or the achievement--of concentration upon the work in hand is a 
two-edged sword.&nbsp; Having deliberately shut oneself off from full 
attention to one's surroundings, there remains a penumbra of vague 
consciousness of what is presented to the senses.&nbsp; As long as everything 
passes normally, there need be no disquietude, still less disturbance; but 
when the routine of nature (as it seems to the worker) is disorganized; a very 
curious and distinctly unpleasant phenomenon takes place.&nbsp; One cannot 
remain perfectly absorbed in contemplation of the 'bright spot in one's 
mind'--so to call it.&nbsp; At the same time, the habit of concentration 
persists, and prevents one from turning one's searchlight upon the moving 
shadows of the background.&nbsp; One realizes dimly that something is going on 
which is unusual, and demands immediate attention; but one cannot awake 
sufficiently--unless the disturbance is very serious indeed--to feel sure 
that one's impressions are justly apprehended.&nbsp; The feeling of 
uneasiness is on such occassions not that which we associate with 
straightforward doubt as to what is happening; there is a touch of some 
equivalent of "a bad conscience" connected with it.&nbsp; One feels that one 
ought to be able to describe events accurately, as one could in normal 
conditions:&nbsp; and the inability to do so takes the form of a sort of timid 
reproach to the observer.&nbsp; He feels himself somehow an inferior--to 
himself as he naturally is.&nbsp; Against this the will to concentrate reacts, 
often with violence:&nbsp; knowing (as one thinks) that whatever it is cannot 
be of any real importance, and therefore ought not to be allowed to interfere 
at all with one's work, one pushes it away with tempestuous anger as a 
weakness.&nbsp; The degree of concentration habitually attained in any case 
determines the degree of success in this process.</P>

<P>Now Mr. Hobbs was a man of very considerable development in this great 
art.&nbsp; Shouting in the street--even a shot--would be dismissed 
automatically from his mind as none of his business; and if questioned 
subsequently, it would be hard for him to say whether he had heard it at all; 
much less, just what he had heard.</P>

<P>Events in his own office would affect him more nearly.&nbsp; His two 
assistants might go in and out all day as part of their regular duty, and he 
would not raise his head.&nbsp; He would be subconsciously aware of the 
approach of Mr. Lubeck and adopt instinctively the proper degree of alertness 
to greet him.&nbsp; The footsteps of a stranger would arouse him completely, 
provided that the moral attitude of that stranger, as witnessed by the 
manner of his tread, might suggest some strikingly unusual interview <I>in 
posse.</I></P>

<P>Bent over his books, therefore, he did not consciously notice the return 
of his two assistants from lunch; for that was the daily occurrence.&nbsp; 
But when, twenty minutes later, they both rose quietly and left the office, 
his attention was attracted to the unusual character of the event.&nbsp; And 
somehow, he got the impression that they were both dressed in the deepest 
mourning--as they certainly had not been before lunch.&nbsp; But why should 
they be in such a costume? He worked it all out even as he went on with his 
figures.&nbsp; They must have lost a relative and obtained permission from 
Mr. Lubeck to attend the funeral that afternoon.&nbsp; Strange, though, that 
he should not have been notified.&nbsp; At this point his will indignantly 
protested.&nbsp; It was no business of his, after all:&nbsp; and--well, he 
couldn't swear that they were in black, now he put the question directly,
though reluctantly enough, to himself.&nbsp; With a final effort he put his 
foot down, and swept the whole matter out of his mind.</P>

<P>At that moment he heard the approaching step of Mr. Lubeck.&nbsp; "Coming 
to explain" he registered briefly; half annoyed at the additional 
distraction.&nbsp; Then he noticed, with genuine alarm--that the well-known 
tread of his superior was slower and more ponderous than its wont.&nbsp; As 
the door of the private office opened he lifted his head, as was customary 
with him, and his face went suddenly white.&nbsp; It was not Mr. Lubeck at all 
but a Police Inspector in uniform.&nbsp; "Nonsense," he cried internally, "I 
know his step among a million.&nbsp; Are my ears or my eyes at fault?" 
suddenly clamoured the sentinel of his mind.&nbsp; Testing his eyes by a 
direct gaze, as he rose to greet the intruder, he was brought up by an 
'impossibility' of the most astounding order.&nbsp; Despite the uniform, it 
was Mr. Lubeck after all!</P>

<P>He growled at himself furiously.&nbsp; He simply could not believe that he 
was hallucinated about the uniform--and then the memory of his vague 
impression of seeing the two clerks in mourning unsettled him.&nbsp; Was it 
then some one with an astonishing resemblance to his chief?</P>

<P>That theory died a sudden death; for the new-comer sat down quietly 
opposite, and began to speak to him casually in the perfectly unmistakeable 
tones of Mr. Lubeck.</P>

<P>Before half a dozen sentences had been spoken Hobb's sentinel was, so to 
speak, shouting and firing off his rifle.&nbsp; He found it utterly impossible 
to attend to the slow deliberate utterance, as his duty and habit was.</P>

<P>His mind had already been badly distracted, and his senses were storming 
at him to acount for the appearance of his chief in that absurd uniform.&nbsp; 
He was so alarmed, psychologically, about his state of mind that he was 
praeternaturally on the alert for any new deviation from the normal.&nbsp; And 
what assailed him was so subtle and so abnormal that it preoccupied his mind 
completely.&nbsp; He did not hear a word of what was being said.&nbsp; What 
he noticed at first vaguely, then with keen curiosity, and finally with 
terrifying accuracy of recognition, was a most strange, though negative 
phenomenon.&nbsp; Outside the clang and hubbub of the street continued as 
ever.&nbsp; But there was some thing missing.&nbsp; Imagine a man lying awake 
with nervous insomnia--at an inn by a waterfall.&nbsp; He is unaware of the 
ticking of his watch under his pillow.&nbsp; But the watch stops.&nbsp; He is 
instantly alarmed.&nbsp; It is some time before he is able to make out what 
has disturbed him.</P>

<P>Just so with Mr. Hobbs:&nbsp; he realized slowly--after what seemed to him 
endless hours--that he was missing the perpetual clack and hum of the outer 
office.&nbsp; Had work suddenly ceased?--and why? What connection might that 
not have with the vague vision of the clerks in mourning, and with Mr. Lubeck's 
incredible masquerade--or his own hallucination?</P>

<P>He dared not make sure of the alternative, by appealing to the sense of 
touch to confirm his eyesight, or by asking his chief point blank about it? 
It might be as much as his job was worth; he might be thought to be going 
insane.&nbsp; And Mr. Hobbs had the very best of reasons for avoiding the 
slightest word or gesture which might in any manner give him away--might sow 
in Mr. Lubeck's mind that he was not altogether the steady, sensible, even 
stolid cashier that he had manifested to enquiring eyes for twenty years with 
such unvarying success.</P>

<P>At this point in his meditations Mr. Lubeck startled him by a sharp change 
of tone.</P>

<P>"Hobbs!" The cashier sat up almost as if he had been struck.</P>

<P>"Are you listening to what I have been saying?" asked his employer, 
severely.</P>

<P>Mechanically, Hobbs repeated the instructions which had just been given.&nbsp; 
His conscious memory had recorded them perfectly.&nbsp; He was to take certain 
bonds--he had examined, verified, and entered their numbers in his ledger 
during the interview--to Mr. Simon Iff's apartment, take his receipt, and any 
further instructions.</P>

<P>"All right," said Lubeck more gently, as if relieved.&nbsp; "Excuse me, 
Hobbs, but I actually fancied for a moment" (he gave a little laugh) "that 
you were actually not paying attention.&nbsp; Of course," the broker assumed a 
soft, almost pitying tone, "it's only natural if you should be a little 
distraught--as it were.&nbsp; You saw it at the lunch hour, I suppose?"</P>

<P>Hobbs assented, still mechanically.&nbsp; What was he supposed to have 
seen? He felt somehow that it would be a dreadful mistake to ask about it.</P>

<P>"Well, then, seal the packet," went on the other.&nbsp; The cashier's 
fingers were nervously employed in thrusting the bonds into a thick office 
envelope.&nbsp; Hobbs complied.</P>

<P>"Now then," went on Lubeck with an intensified seriousness, "that is not 
quite all.&nbsp; Please give me the whole of your attention:&nbsp; every 
detail of what I am going to say is of vital importance."</P>

<P>The cashier, putting the packet on one side, bent over to catch the low 
voice.&nbsp; It seemed as if secrecy, even in that empty office--was in some 
danger.&nbsp; At the same instant he paled once more.&nbsp; A footstep was 
again approaching:&nbsp; familiar somehow, and yet Hobbs was sure he had never 
heard it in his life--no, he knew it only too well--no, impossible--Keenly 
introspective, he evoked the <I>'sens du d&#233;ja &#233;cout&#233;'</I> to  
explain.</P>

<P>"Come, come!" said Lubeck reproachfully.&nbsp; "I quite understand.&nbsp; 
Go home when you are through with Mr. Iff--and take a day off to-morrow.&nbsp; 
I wouldn't have asked you at all but you're the only man I can trust on a 
business like this!"</P>

<P>The cashier, by a violent effort of will, fixed his eyes on those of his 
employer, and put his whole conscious being under control.&nbsp; But do what 
he might, he could not help hearing the footsteps in the outer office, or 
feeling in the marrow of his bones that their maker was no other than 
Stephen Adams.</P>

<P>The door opened.&nbsp; Stephen! No! Of course not, frightfully, ghastly 
like him, though.&nbsp; But it was a girl? He looked heavily at Lubeck:&nbsp; 
not a flicker of an eyelid gave any sign that he was aware of the entrance of 
the new-comer.</P>

<P>The girl took off her overcoat and 'Derby' and hung them on the pegs sacred 
to his ex-assistant.&nbsp; His eyes started from his head:&nbsp; she was in 
convict clothes.&nbsp; She sat down calmly at Stephen's old desk, opened the 
books, and began to write.</P>

<P>Mr. Lubeck gave no sign; instead, he laid his hand, kindly enough, on the 
cashier's trembling arm.&nbsp; "I don't want to ask you for the third time," 
he said compassionately, "to give me every last particle of your attention."</P>

<P>But this time Hobbs' whole mind revolted.&nbsp; Come what might, he must 
clear up this insane mystery.</P>

<P>"The girl in the chair!" he gasped.&nbsp; Mr. Lubeck repeated the words, in 
blank amazement.</P>

<P>"What girl? What chair?"</P>

<P>"There! there!" cried the cashier, releasing his forearm, and pointing.</P>

<P>"Where? Are you plumb crazy?" answered his chief, with irritation.&nbsp; 
"Really, Hobbs, this isn't like you."</P>

<P>Hobbs still pointed; the girl quietly rose, put on her hat and coat and 
left the office.</P>

<P>"My dear man, I don't see any girl!"</P>

<P>No:&nbsp; didn't you see her go?"</P>

<P>"Tut, you must be seriously ill, man," cried Lubeck, with great concern in 
his voice.&nbsp; "Are you rehearsing the supper scene from Macbeth?"</P>

<P>The unhappy cashier subsided into his chair, and sat, panting, holding with 
nervous agitation to its arms; and gazing blankly upon the other's wondering 
face.</P>

<P>There was a long silence.&nbsp; At last.&nbsp; "I was dizzy for a moment," 
stammered Hobbs.&nbsp; "Headache--couldn't sleep last night--something at 
lunch..."</P>

<P>"More beauties of prohibition?" laughed Lubeck, as if to reassure him.</P>

<P>"No, no, sir; never a drop!" cried the other, seriously upset at such a 
suspicion; "Just indigestion--fancied I saw something for a moment--better 
now--beg your pardon, sir, most sincerely."</P>

<P>"Good man, if you feel all right now, get along.&nbsp; We mustn't keep Mr. 
Iff waiting."</P>

<P>"No sir," replied Hobbs miserably, and began to undo his waistcoat to put 
away the packet in the special pocket which he used for such purposes.</P>

<P>With a brief nod, and a cheery word, Mr. Lubeck walked out of the office.</P>

<P>But the cashier, having buttoned up the packet safely sat lost in the 
deepest thought.&nbsp; Was this fantastic adventure a joke?--unthinkable.&nbsp; 
A plot of some kind? He could not imagine his employer party to anything of 
the sort.&nbsp; Hallucination then, after all? The idea worried him very 
badly.&nbsp; He knew just enough of medicine to think that one sure 
characteristic of any such delusions would be that the victim could not 
possibly suspect them to be anything but real.&nbsp; His mind began a zig-zag 
logical sorites on the problem:&nbsp; every time he came to any conclusion 
some detail or other would pop up again and reverse the probabilities once 
more.</P>

<P>"Whew," he muttered, wiping his forehead.&nbsp; "I'll think more clearly in 
the fresh air."&nbsp; And he flung out of the office:&nbsp; in his state of 
mental disturbance, he forgot to take his hat and coat.</P>

<P>In the outer room he got a new shock.&nbsp; It was, as his ears had told 
him, empty.&nbsp; He looked at his watch.&nbsp; "Too absurd," he muttered, in 
acute annoyance.&nbsp; He walked across; just then he heard the closing of a 
ledger, in Mr. Lubeck's private office.</P>

<P>"I'll go and see about that uniform and settle that once and for all."&nbsp; 
He would have been positively relieved to find his chief disguised as a Zulu 
warrior.&nbsp; No such luck! He was sitting in his ordinary business clothes, 
very intent on his work.&nbsp; No trace of any masquerade.</P>

<P>"Well, what is it, Hobbs?" the chief did not look up.</P>

<P>"I beg your pardon, sir, did you say I might take to-morrow off?" was the 
best excuse he could invent.</P>

<P>"I did," replied Lubeck with a peculiar intonation which somehow struck 
terror into his inmost marrow, though he could not have said why.&nbsp; He 
went out like a man in a dream.</P>

<P>The elevator, the hallway, the street all reassured him that his senses 
were intact.&nbsp; But then...? In a way, that made things rather more serious 
than ever.&nbsp; It was curious, too, the way in which people were looking at 
him--at least--were they?</P>

<P>"Damn it, I'll square this!" he cried, as he pushed his way into Park 
Place.&nbsp; "Here's a sane man:&nbsp; I'll test myself by him."</P>

<P>He went up to the traffic cop.&nbsp; "Would you mind telling me what that 
building is, officer?" he said, pointing to the Woolworth.</P>

<P>The man knew the cashier by sight well enough:&nbsp; he had seen him pass 
there four times a day for years.&nbsp; Why hadn't he his hat and coat? And 
why did he look so agitated? And why--of all things--ask such a fool question? 
He decided that there was a joke or a bet in the background.</P>

<P>"Yes, Sir Ethelred, beg pardon, my lord," he answered saluting.&nbsp; 
"That there edifice is Grant's Tomb"</P>

<P>In any other circumstances the psychology of the moment would have been 
clear enough to Hobbs and reassured him finally that he was sane; but as 
things were, the answer shook him badly.&nbsp; He suppressed an inclination to 
howl and run off:&nbsp; he stood a moment dazed.&nbsp; The policeman began to 
suspect something wrong, and would have interfered; but the sense of routine 
duty came back suddenly to the cashier--in the complete ruin of the 
superstructure of his mind; he hailed a passing taxi, called out the address 
of Simon Iff and sank back with a sense of luxurious relief.&nbsp; It seemed 
to him, though, he had no idea why, that he was safe at last, that he had 
stumbled out of the nightmare as mysteriously and suddenly as he had stumbled 
into it.</P>

<P>Every detail of the journey up town, familiar and restful, restored him 
almost wholly to himself.&nbsp; He was able, by an effort, to distrust the 
unsolved problem of the past half hour, and was sufficiently himself by the 
time the car drew up to realize that he was hatless and coatless.</P>

<P>"Why, of course, that explains the whole thing," he murmured joyfully--not 
seeing in the least any explanation of even any one part of it.&nbsp; It was 
his sub-conscious self, alarmed for his sanity, that had been subtly 
reassured by the fact that events, generally speaking, had resumed their 
normal tone.&nbsp; There had been an accident of some sort, as the lack of hat 
and coat declared, but it was over now; it had not been serious; and as soon 
as he learnt the reson for his neglect; the nightmare features of his 
'attack'--so he now called it--would become explicable.&nbsp; Amnesia, that's 
it, he concluded happily, as he paid off the chauffeur with that proud delight 
that the half-educated experience on finding themselves in bed with a long 
Greek or Latin word which is often in the newspapers and must be therefore 
perfectly respectable.</P>

<P><CENTER>VI</CENTER></P>

<P>The embarrassment of Mr. Hobbs about the absence of his had and coat 
completely dominated his mind between the taxi and the door of Simon Iff's 
apartment.&nbsp; He had quite satisfied himself that whatever had happened 
at the office was over and done with.&nbsp; It was therefore a terrific shock 
when the door was opened by that very replica of Sterilized Stephen in 
feminine flesh and felon attire that had flitted through his office an hour 
earlier.&nbsp; He was struck speechless.&nbsp; But the girl addressed him 
without a trace of surprise.&nbsp; "Mr. Hobbs from Lubeck and Lewison," she 
said; "come right in, Mr. Iff's expecting you."</P>

<P>Despite his conscious paralysis, something in his mind registered the fact 
that the girl's accents were not Caucasian or Semitic; it was the precise and 
pretty, soft and slurred English of a Mongol.&nbsp; The effect was to bewilder 
him completely.&nbsp; His subconscious good sense told him surreptitiously of 
a possible point to the farce in the office, but there was no rational 
connection to be traced in this and it led him back to the state of 
uncertanity as to whether his senses were not playing him tricks.&nbsp; He  
suddenly rememberred Simon Iff's reputation as a magician.&nbsp; As the girl 
led the way to the door of his study he felt rather like a character in an 
Arabian Night, doubtful as to what dreadful or horrible experience might be 
lurking behind the door.</P>

<P>Ushered into the study, he was immediately reassured.&nbsp; There was 
nothing in any way abnormal.&nbsp; He began to look for the big envelope which 
he was to deliver but Iff stopped him.</P>

<P>"I thought if you had the time, Mr. Hobbs, we might to down to the bank 
together.&nbsp; The bonds will be safer where they are.&nbsp; But I see you 
are a little out of breath.&nbsp; Will you take a cigarette and a cup of 
coffee with me? As you see, I am just finishing lunch."</P>

<P>He filled a cup for the cashier and a liqueur glass of old brandy.&nbsp; 
He lit a match for Hobbs' cigarette and the two men smoked in silence.&nbsp; 
Somehow or other the calm impersonal gaze of the magician had the effect of 
making Hobbs extremelly ill at ease.&nbsp; He felt himself--he had no idea 
why--in the presence of a god; very gentle, yet very terrible; one who saw 
through him without even seeing him.&nbsp; And there was born in his mind an 
almost overmastering impulse to lay open his soul.&nbsp; His instinct of 
self-preservation held him back and he satisfied the impulse by appealing to 
the magician for an explanation of the extraordinary events at the office.</P>

<P>Simon listened without surprise.</P>

<P>"This sort of thing is fairly common," he said, and went into a little 
technical sermon on hallucinations and their causes.</P>

<P>"It is only natural," he concluded, "that you should be mentally upset.&nbsp; 
You were quite all right before lunch, weren't you?"</P>

<P>"Quite," said Hobbs.</P>

<P>"Exactly," continued Simon.&nbsp; "Your hallucinations are simply due to 
what happened during the lunch hour."</P>

<P>"But nothing happened during the lunch hour," objected Hobbs.</P>

<P>"What! Didn't you see it?" cried Simon, with the utmost surprise.</P>

<P>"See what? I don't know what you mean!" stammered the cashier, thoroughly 
alarmed, he knew not why.</P>

<P>Iff struck a hand bell at his side, and the cashier almost jumped out of 
his chair.</P>

<P>The girl appeared at the door.&nbsp; Simon addressed her volubly in 
Japanese, and she answered briefly in that language, with a low bow and 
disappeared.</P>

<P>Hobbs could not contain himself.&nbsp; He told Iff how things looked to 
him.</P>

<P>"What, Togo in stripes?" cried Iff laughing, and then checked himself and 
looked at the trembling man before him with the most serious commiseration.&nbsp;  
"Strange, strange," he said in a meditative voice.&nbsp; "I could understand 
it if you had seen it."</P>

<P>"Seen what?" cried Hobbs, his voice rising to a scream.&nbsp; By his elbow 
was the girl in stripes.&nbsp; She was handing a copy of the Evening Mercury 
to her master.</P>

<P>Iff ran his finger down the columns.&nbsp; In the stop press was only one 
paragraph.&nbsp; It started loudly from the blank of the rest of the column.</P>

<P><CENTER><I>SUICIDE in SING SING.</I></CENTER></P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Stephen Adams, recently convicted for theft of bonds, hanged 
himself in the prison early this morning.</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>The finger with which Simon directed his attention to that bald statement, 
seemed to the guilty man like the finger of God.&nbsp; He was struck 
speechless.&nbsp; His face went blank as a sheet of paper.&nbsp; Iff took no 
notice.</P>

<P>"If you didn't see that," he said slowly, "I don't see what upset your 
mind so seriously as to make you see things.&nbsp; You don't drug?" he asked 
sharply.</P>

<P>Hobbs tried to frame the words 'never in my life' but his articulation 
refused its office.</P>

<P>"Can it be?" mused Simon Iff--and rose suddenly from his chair.</P>

<P>"Never mind the cause," he declared vigourously, "the cure is the thing.&nbsp; 
Business before pleasure.&nbsp; Attend to duty and never mind the tricks our 
eyes sometimes play us.&nbsp; Let's get down to the bank.&nbsp; Here, swallow 
this."</P>

<P>He poured the cashier a stiff drink of brandy which pulled him together 
physically but left his mind in a blank passive state.&nbsp; He was quite fit 
to do anything, but deprived of initiative, of the power to think, in all but 
the most superficial sense of that phrase.</P>

<P>He followed Iff out of the room and was not in the least surprised to find 
Togo looking like a quite ordinary Japanese servant.&nbsp; Simon asked him 
about it.</P>

<P>"You see," he said, "you're better already.&nbsp; But when they got to the 
outer entrance, instead of Iff's motor car he saw a prison van.&nbsp; However, 
it did not seem so apparently to Simon, who said:</P>

<P>"I think it'll do you good if we walk down to the bank this day.&nbsp; 
Nothing like fresh air to blow away the cobwebs."</P>

<P>Hobbs assented mechanically and Iff addressed the uniformed driver.</P>

<P>"I shan't want you this afternoon, Dobson," he said, "but be back for the 
theatre after dinner.&nbsp; Amuse yourself as you like till then."</P>

<P>"Yes, sir, thank you, sir," replied the man saluting; and even distressed 
as he was, Hobbs could not fail to observe that the man's accent was utterly 
remote from anything American.&nbsp; He began to analyse his perceptions.&nbsp; 
He tried to look at his experiences in perspective.&nbsp; It seemed in 
particular that his ears were somehow at war with his eyes.&nbsp; No, that 
didn't account for everything.&nbsp; He began to realize that almost all the 
inexplicable perceptions had something to do with Stephen and the police.&nbsp; 
Were they then phantasms created by his conscience? If not, was he suspected? 
Had a comedy been staged to firghten him into confession? Knowing himself safe, 
he brightened instantly at the thought.&nbsp; And yet, when he considered the 
matter, it seemed impossible.&nbsp; There would not have been time to prepare 
so elaborate a scheme, for Stephen had only hanged himself that very 
morning.&nbsp; And then he realized for the first time the import of that 
fact.&nbsp; It was he that was responsible for the boy's death.&nbsp; He had 
not thought of that before.&nbsp; He had hated Stephen as a coward and a prig 
and despised him as a crank.&nbsp; He had felt no remorse at his 
imprisonment.&nbsp; But that he should have kiled himself was another 
story.&nbsp; Why had he not foreseen that such an issue was inevitable, given 
the ultra-neurotic character of the boy?</P>

<P>Hobbs had never believed in the supernatural, but now it seemed to him as 
the only rational explanation of events to suppose that by some mysterious 
sympathy, a dead man was somehow able to revenge himself by throwing the 
mental machinery of his murderer out of gear.&nbsp; There were plenty of 
well-authenticated stories of the sort.</P>

<P>"I must pull myself together," he thought, "whatever I do, I mustn't give 
myself away.&nbsp; I must ask for a holiday and go to a safe place till I've 
got over these fancies."</P>

<P>And he began to make plans but they were always interfered with by a vision 
of his victim hanging from a bar of his cell window.</P>

<P>"Here, wake up!" said Simon Iff, who had not spoken all the way to the 
bank.&nbsp; "Here we are."</P>

<P>Hobbs took stock of his surroundings.&nbsp; Again his eyes were playing 
him false.&nbsp; An automobile was drawn up at the door of the bank and in it 
were two fashionable ladies, almost extravagantly dressed.&nbsp; There was a 
little crowd around the car, which the porter was trying to keep back.&nbsp; 
And the motive of the crowd was evident, for the chauffeur was the girl in 
stripes.</P>

<P>Then did other people share his hallucinations? Slight as the matter was in 
comparison with what had passed, its incongruity brought to the ground all his 
previous theories and left his mind more completely bewildered than ever.&nbsp; 
It could be hallucination if other people could see that accursed girl, and it 
couldn't be a comedy staged for his benefit, for that fact would knock the 
house of cards to pieces.</P>

<P>He followed Iff to the receiving teller's desk and pulled out the sealed 
envelope.&nbsp; The teller opened it.&nbsp; The man's face changed.&nbsp; 
"There's some mistake here, Mr. Hobbs," he said, "except these two, these 
bonds are forgeries."</P>

<P>The cashier found himself unable to utter a word.&nbsp; The teller gave a 
signal and two of the plain clothes men in the bank immediately slipped their 
arms through those of the terrified Hobbs.&nbsp; History had repeated 
itself.&nbsp; A glaring light broke in upon his mind.</P>

<P>"It's a conspiracy," he shouted, "and I know exactly how the trick was 
done."</P>

<P>"Yes, you might tell us about that," said Simon very gently.</P>

<P>Hobbs no longer knew what he was saying.</P>

<P>"I'm not guilty," he cried, "Adams can clear me."</P>

<P>"Isn't it rather for you to clear Adams?" suggested Simon Iff, and then the 
cashier remembered that Adams was lying dead in prison.</P>

<P>"I never meant to kill him," he went on.&nbsp; "I never thought he couldn't 
stand..." and once again he broke off short, appalled.</P>

<P>He saw that he had no chance to clear himself.&nbsp; He had sealed up the 
envelope and it had been in his possession till that moment.&nbsp; He knew 
too well that it had been changed by the girl in stripes while Mr. Lubeck was 
talking to him, but he couldn't tell that story to a jury, he couldn't tell it 
to his own attorney.&nbsp; they would only say that he was shamming mad to get 
off.&nbsp; He had been trapped and instinctively he turned to Simon Iff to 
save him.</P>

<P>"I didn't steal the bonds," he whined.&nbsp; "I want justice."</P>

<P>"Then you must do it yourself," answered Simon.&nbsp; "Come, let us go into 
the president's room and tell us the whole story."</P>

<P>Completely broken down, the cashier complied.&nbsp; Iff had accurately 
divined the method employed to scare Sterilized Stephen.&nbsp; Hobbs had led up 
to the critical moment by teasing Stephen about his fears and threatening that 
one day he would bring down a culture of virulent bacilli and shedding them 
over him.&nbsp; He had, in fact; squirted a little dirty water on Stephen's 
person and taken advantage of his distraction to change the bonds.&nbsp; Hobbs 
ended his confession with an appeal for mercy.</P>

<P>"It shall be granted," answered Simon, and sent for a copy of the Evening 
Mercury.&nbsp; It was the same edition as the copy in Iff's apartment, but 
the top press column contained no reference to Stephen Adams.</P>

<P><CENTER>VII</CENTER></P>

<P>Simon Iff had been absent from New York for some weeks attending to the 
matter (elsewhere recorded) of Col. Van Schuyler.&nbsp; On his return he 
found a letter from Mr. Lubeck who concluded his congratulations by inviting 
the magician to dinner to meet Stephen Adams and his sister Violet.&nbsp; 
The boy had been released immediately on the confession of Hobbs and the 
dinner party was intended, not only to celebrate the victory, but to plan 
future campaigns.&nbsp; The stockbroker's original interest in his aseptic 
employee had been revivified by the sympathy he felt for his tribulations.&nbsp; 
The good man blamed himself quite unjustly for his reluctant contribution to 
the catastrophe.&nbsp But Simon Iff was in the most cantankerous mood.&nbsp; 
He would not admit that any castastrophe had taken place.&nbsp; He blamed 
Lubeck, not for prosecuting his clerk, but for having encouraged him in his 
iniquity.&nbsp; He had no kind word for Stephen that night.&nbsp; All through 
dinner, in defiance of every rule of politeness, he treated the boy with 
savage contempt.&nbsp; He lost no opportunity of sneering at everything he 
said; he criticized his personal appearance in absolutely unpardonable
terms.&nbsp; 
There was never such a bear at any dinner party that New York had ever seen.&nbsp; 
Only with Violet did he preserve the commonest form of politeness.</P>

<P>Not until dinner was over did Simon unmask his really heavy artillery.&nbsp; 
He attacked Sterilized Stephen with callous brutality so that Mr. Lubeck, 
seeing how acutely his guest was suffering, unable to defend himself because 
his enemy was also his saviour, ventured a word of protest.</P>

<P>"My dear man," retorted Iff, "have you no common sense? Can't you see that 
this rag of humanity is on the way to getting worse torn than ever? What's his 
whole attitude? That of a deeply injured man, who has been justified.&nbsp; 
His punishment begins now.</P>

<P>"You had Dr. Braithwaite examine you three days ago?"</P>

<P>"Yes," stammered Stephen, "and he told me I was perfectly healthy."</P>

<P>"That's what he told you," sneered Iff.&nbsp; "But here's his private 
report of the scraping he took from your throat."</P>

<P>He took a paper from his pocket book and passed it to Stephen.&nbsp; The 
gesture was as if he had stabbed him.&nbsp; The boy read the slip.&nbsp; It 
appeared that his throat harboured the germs of influenza, diphtheria, and 
typhoid, and some half dozen lesser diseases.</P>

<P>It was necessary to apply restoratives.&nbsp; At last, he mastered himself 
sufficiently to stammer something about his death warrant.</P>

<P>"Now look here, my boy," said Simon.&nbsp; "That's all nonsense.&nbsp; All 
our throats are full of those germs all the time.&nbsp; But none of us get any 
of those diseases except under special conditions, the chief of which is a 
lowered vitality.&nbsp; Now, nothing lowers vitality so much as fear.&nbsp; 
Look at yourself.&nbsp; The doctor declares you in perfect health and yet you 
nearly faint when I pass you a scrap of paper.&nbsp; I've travelled a bit in 
the tropics and seen plague and cholera sweeping away who townships as a storm 
scatters the leaves from trees in autumn.&nbsp; I thought even in America 
every one knew that the one sure way to get an epidemic disease was to funk 
it."</P>

<P>"That's right," put in Lubeck.&nbsp; "I was in Panama in the old days and 
the people who got yellow jack were not the people who took the big risks but 
the people who brooded on the danger."</P>

<P>"There's another point too," pursued Simon.&nbsp; "When fear, which is a 
definite pathological condition, a disease far more deadly than tuberculosis, 
attains a certain degree of intensity, it deprives a man of the use of his 
five senses.&nbsp; Did you ever read that essay of Sullivan's on Human 
Testimony?"</P>

<P>It appeared that nobody had.</P>

<P>"Well, you should," proceeded Simon.&nbsp; "However, I'll quote you, as 
nearly as memory serves me, one remark.</P>

<P>"During the war it was noticed that the evidence of soldiers freshly 
wounded was often of the most fantastic description.&nbsp; They would testify 
to the details of catastrophes which had never occurred; they would assert 
that so-and-so had been decapitated in front of their eyes, and so-and-so 
buried by an explosion, when, as a matter of fact, nothing remotely resembling 
these events had taken place."</P>

<P>"Is that possible?" asked Lubeck.</P>

<P>"Well, you ought to know," retorted the magician.&nbsp; "You've had the 
case of this wretched invertebrate here and a much more striking example under 
your very nose."</P>

<P>"Yes," said Lubeck; "of course.&nbsp; Do you know, I've never really 
understood how you got away with that absurd business of Hobbs.&nbsp; He 
wasn't at all the nervous hysterical type and he hadn't been freshly 
wounded."</P>

<P>"Fishing for compliments," laughed Simon.&nbsp; "I've already congratulated 
you on the goodness of heart which inhibits so effectively the operation of 
your cerebral cortex.&nbsp; Hobbs had lived for years with the worst kind of 
fear:&nbsp; that of being found out.&nbsp; It wasn't pathological in the sense 
of being irrational, but on the other hand, he had no protection whatever 
against it.&nbsp; He couldn't fly to antiseptics whenever it became acute.&nbsp; 
He couldn't even relieve his mind by talking about it.&nbsp; He had to be 
perpetually sitting on the safety valve; and any form of suppression always 
tends to turn normal instinct into pathological channels.&nbsp; I didn't 
expect to break him down by the scene in the office.&nbsp; I saw to it that he 
was freshly wounded.</P>

<P>"I staged the comedy to prepare him for the wound.&nbsp; I wanted to evoke 
his fear from the hell of the unconscious self in order that it might shake 
his confidence in his own critical judgement; in his sense of reality."</P>

<P>"But no one would really believe that his eyes and ears had gone wrong so 
suddenly and to that extent.&nbsp; He must have suspected that we were laying 
a fantastic trap for him and that should have put him on his guard rather 
than induced him to betray himself."</P>

<P>"True enough," admitted Simon.&nbsp; "But the things he saw were, so to 
speak, phantasms of his hidden fear, connected vaguely with Stephen through 
Violet's likeness to him, and the circumstances of the plot, assuming it to 
be one, were all so wildly improbable.&nbsp; The result was that a mere 
trifle of absolutely genuine evidence, as he supposed, believing (as people 
of his class do) in the newspapers, was enough to wound his guilty 
conscience.&nbsp; It never occurred to him that I had had that paragraph  
specially printed in my copy of the Mercury, especially as we had both 
prepared him for it by attributing his experiences, which we both assumed to 
be hallucinations, to something which we pretended to suppose that he must 
have seen during the lunch hour."</P>

<P>"Yes," said Mr. Lubeck thoughtfully, "but Hobbs was hardened by years of 
crime and utterly callous of the consequences to others."</P>

<P>Simon looked at him very sadly.&nbsp; "Surely you understand," he said 
slowly, "that such callousness is the very measure of the intensity of his 
own fear.&nbsp; The thought of prison was so intolerable to him that he did 
not dare to allow himself the luxury of the faintest human sympathy for his 
victims.&nbsp; But he had not contemplated death.&nbsp; He saw in an instant, 
taking him at his worst, that to be found out might drive him to kill 
himself.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he was not as mad as that; he suffered 
genuine remorse.&nbsp; The psychological resultant was however the same.&nbsp; 
What he lost on the swings, he made up on the roundabouts.&nbsp; In any case 
we were sure of the main object:&nbsp; to render him incapable, at the 
critical moment, of the normal reaction.&nbsp; He saw himself caught in the 
identical trap which he had sprung on Stephen.&nbsp; He saw instantly, with 
every particle of his instinct of self-preservation, that this fact proved 
his innocence; that he was the victim of a clever scheme, so that in his 
anxiety to prove his innocence, he exclaimed jubilantly that he knew exactly 
how the trick was turned.&nbsp; In his normal state he would have perceived 
the implications of the statement.&nbsp; Suppose a man has been swindled by 
the three card trick; he could not have been swindled if he knew exactly how 
the trick was done.&nbsp; His explanation proved previous knowledge.&nbsp; 
We cannot be sure of the deep workings of his mind at this point but this at 
least is evident; that the series of shocks had quite abrogated his conscious 
control.&nbsp; He probably recognized his blunder in some stratum beneath 
clear consciousness; for he instantly completed it by the appeal to Stephen 
to clear him, very much as a man in certain conditions will run his bicycle 
into the very object which he is trying to avoid.&nbsp; The realization that 
Stephen was dead crowned the edifice with ills, as Euripides says.&nbsp; His 
unconscious stood before us all, stark in its horror of malignity and fear.&nbsp; 
The one relief which he had so long denied himself--confession--became the 
over mastering passion and he reeled off the list of his iniquities with 
something really not far from gusto.&nbsp; He had to get rid of 20 years of 
silence in a single outburst."</P>

<P>"Well, I must say," remarked Mr. Lubeck, "it has been a most masterly 
demonstration of psychology."</P>

<P>"I'm not very proud of it," replied Simple Simon.&nbsp; "The method was far 
too elaborate and complex to please me.&nbsp; It ought to have been managed in 
a quiet conversation.&nbsp; My excuse is that I had really no access even to 
the person of Hobbs.&nbsp; He was guarded in every way but one; and I had to 
arrange a scenario which would cut short all ways of escape.&nbsp; It was 
necessary that all explanations of events were equally untenable.&nbsp; 
However, enough of the past.&nbsp; Our business is to <I>un</I>sterilize 
Stephen.&nbsp; The bacillus of self-esteem finds him a most favourable 
medium.&nbsp; I doubt if he understands even now how I despise and loathe 
him.&nbsp; My chief satisfaction in getting him out of gaol is that I have 
saved his fellow criminals from the contamination of his example.&nbsp; I 
cannot even make him angry," growled the mystic.&nbsp; "If he had any self 
respect, instead of self-esteem, he would have walked out of the house an hour 
ago."</P>

<P>The outraged youth began a homily on gratitude.</P>

<P>"I don't want your gratitude," howled Iff.&nbsp; "That's only another 
clean collar, and what you need is to play in the mud.&nbsp; You were brought 
up with a host of virtues, so called; so many painted masks to hide the face 
of a coward.&nbsp; You even despised your sister, and where would you be now 
without her? You've got to chuck all that.&nbsp; It's all a mass of iniquity, 
a monstrous growth in a thousand hideous forms of the original fear which was 
drilled into you by that accursed old hag, Aunt Dorcas, who, I hope, is 
roasting in hell at this minute.&nbsp; However, you've had your medicine; and 
I'm going to give you a chance."</P>

<P>His hand went back to his pocket and he produced a letter which he handed 
to Lubeck.&nbsp; The good old man's eyes grew dim as he read it.&nbsp; He went 
over to Stephen and laid his hand on the boy's shoulder.</P>

<P>"I am glad I prosecuted," he said with humourous brusqueness, "I couldn't 
have done as much for you as this if you had stayed with me for ten years."</P>

<P>"Dear Mr. Iff," he read aloud, "I think this is about what you want.&nbsp; 
Send Adams to me at four o'clock next Monday.&nbsp; He can manage our new 
branch at Fu Ling above Hankow."</P>

<P>Stephen only understood that he was appointed to a position of great and 
absolute responsibility carrying a very great increase on any salary he might 
have hoped for for many years to come.&nbsp; He sprang to his feet.&nbsp; But 
Iff checked him with a gesture.</P>

<P>"Fu Ling is a glorious place," said he.&nbsp; "I was there a few years 
back.&nbsp; The only European in the place was the Custom's collector.&nbsp; 
He was just getting over a couple of bullet wounds in the riot when the 
missionary was killed, thank God.&nbsp; That's why he wasn't there.&nbsp; It's 
a delightful old town--on the top of a mound about 70 feet above the plain; 
not a natural mound, of course; the solidified refuse of centuries.&nbsp; 
There is no sanitation as we understand it, not even in a European's house, 
and I hope you will notice that every one is healthy as anywhere else.&nbsp; 
The death rate is about the same as in this country.</P>

<P>"Of course," he said as if by an after thought, "there are lepers."</P>

<P>Stephen's hair had not yet grown long enough to stand any straighter than 
it did.</P>

<P>"I shouldn't worry," went on Iff remorselessly, "there's no influenza, no 
cerebro-spinal meningitis, no sleeping sickness, no consumption, no cancer, 
no rickets, and better still, none of those hydra-headed imaginary diseases 
which afflict us weekly in the Sunday Newspapers.&nbsp; The risk of being 
murdered is a good deal less one half percent of what it is in Memphis, 
Tennessee.&nbsp; The risk of Hobbs is nil.</P>

<P>"You have to learn courage and self-respect out there," he went on, "and 
you will also lose your self-esteem, for you have to face reality every hour 
of the day--and night, and in reality," he concluded, on a full diaphragm, 
"every man is a hero and every man is a god."</P>

<P>Something broke in the brain of Sterilized Stephen.&nbsp; He strode forward 
impulsively, head erect and sparkling eyes, to clasp the outstretched hand of 
the magician but all he said was "I'll go," though his lips were as white as 
his cheeks.</P>

<P>Simon Iff collected Violet with his free hand.</P>

<P>"Observe, my child," he said.&nbsp; "He says he will go.&nbsp; And is not 
going the sure sign of godhead? Old artists represented the Egyptian gods as 
bearing a sandal strap in token that their function was to go, to go through 
every phase of existence untouched by anything they chanced to meet.&nbsp; 
Did you never hear the saying 'Every man and every woman is a star?' And what 
does a star do but go and give light in its going."</P>

<P>The eyes of the girl were fixed upon him with the soft yearning look of a 
dog for its master.</P>

<P>"Yes, my dear," he smiled, "you're going too.&nbsp; Your job in life is to 
look after your brother.&nbsp; You've seen all the worst side of life.&nbsp; 
Your experience is just what he needs."</P>

<P>He sat down in a big arm chair and lighted a proportionate cigar.</P>

<P>"The trouble with respectability," he said, "is this:&nbsp; that for the 
most part it doesn't exist at all.&nbsp; It's a fantasm created by fear.&nbsp; 
For this reason, every cunning scoundrel can use it to cloak his misdeeds.&nbsp; 
But when you've got rid of the sham, the genuine good of humanity comes and 
Violet here knows how much lovelier were the lives of the harlots and 
criminals with whom she has lived for years than those of people like Aunt 
Dorcas, who practically condemned her to starve to death for following a 
natural impulse, or the boy who persuaded her to it and left her to sink.&nbsp; 
Which is the better man, the thief who stands you a meal and a drink out of 
coarse comradeship or the cop who blackmails you out of half your earnings on 
Broadway? You'll find an honest set of values at Fu Ling.&nbsp; You have never 
done anything in your life that wasn't perfectly decent and 
straightforward--in itself, I mean, dear girl--apart from the artificial 
restrictions of society.&nbsp; You failed financially through ignorance of the 
low cunning and the hypocritical tricks of your neighbours, and the poison of 
their vileness is so strong that they actually persuaded you that they were 
right to despise you.&nbsp; That's why you're going to Fu Ling with 
Stephen.&nbsp; For another thing, you would never recover in this mephitic 
atmosphere.&nbsp; Out there, you will be a royal personage by right of race, 
and they will all look up to you because you won't look down on them as 
missionaries do, God burn their rotten souls in hell, that the smoke may be 
for a sign."</P>

<P>The essence of Violet's nature was to love and trust, to protect when she 
felt strong, to appeal when she felt weak.&nbsp; At the moment it was as if 
she had been suddenly hoisted on to a throne and a moment's fear passed over 
her face, the noble fear that she might not live up to her task.&nbsp; She 
murmured something about the strange ways of those strange people.</P>

<P>"They won't be strange to you," the mystic said, "mankind is just the same 
all over the world.&nbsp; The differences between civilizations are the 
differences between shams, for the most part.&nbsp; The primal needs of all 
men are alike and those needs form the basis of all their funny little ways.&nbsp; 
You have been at grips with them all your life and you will make no mistake in 
dealing with people as long as you love and understand."</P>

<P>There was dead silence in the room.&nbsp; Simon Iff suddenly discarded his 
prophetic manner and became the conventional guest.</P>

<P>"Good-night and good-bye for a while," he said; "I must return to my 
sheep."</P>

<P>When he had gone, the silence lasted for a long while.&nbsp; Each of the 
three were lost in his own thoughts.&nbsp; When Violet thought it time to 
retire, Lubeck took them to the door himself and as he shook hands, jerked his 
head over his shoulder towards the number on the door.</P>

<P>"Good-night, my children, remember your father's address."</P>

<P><CENTER>VIII</CENTER></P>

<P>Fifteen months later a serious riot in Fu Ling was aborted by the moral 
and physical courage of Violet and Stephen.&nbsp; He had learnt that the only 
germ he had to fear was the germ of fear in himself.&nbsp; And to that, a year 
in China had made him immune.</P>

<HR WIDTH="50%">
<P>*Although Mr. Lubeck is speaking he refers to himself as if he were 
another.&nbsp; Can it be that the Master Therion, unlike the Pope, is 
<I>not</I> infallible? I allowed the sentence to stand as it was.<BR>
