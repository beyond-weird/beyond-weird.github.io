The Monkey and 
the Buzz-Saw</h2></CENTER>

<CENTER><h3 class="heading">by Aleister 
Crowley</h3></CENTER>

<P>"Desperate Bear Raid on Coal, sir," announced Simon Iff's Japanese servant, 
cheerfully, as he brought in the morning chocolate, and pulled back the 
curtains to let in the lovely sunlight.&nbsp; The mystic had instructed him 
carefully in this manner of announcing the weather; for he had observed that 
Americans, informed of any event, from a railroad accident or a strike or a 
war to a change in the fashion of hair cutting, would invariably consult an 
internal monitor, asking, <I>"Cui profuerit?"</I> - Americanice:&nbsp; "Who's 
the grafter?" - accompanied by a rapid calculation of "Where do I come 
in?"&nbsp; Thus they would attribute an epidemic to financial distress in 
medical circles, the ravages of the boll weevil to a conspiracy to put up the 
price of cotton, or a shortage of sugar to a plan to discredit some particular 
set of politicians.</P>

<P>Simon Iff had merely extended this theory to cover natural events; rain, 
according to him, was caused by the united praying-power of the umbrella 
manufacturerers combined with such farmers as needed it for their crops.&nbsp; 
The San Francisco Earthquake had been engineered as an advertisement by those 
builders whose edifices had been found to stand the strain.</P>

<P>"Bring me a cigarette and the newspaper!" he called.&nbsp; The servant 
appeared immediately, with an enamelled box, and a Chinese manuscript, in 
vermillion and gold upon palm leaves, dating from the sixteenth century, of 
the <I>Tao Teh Ching</I>.&nbsp; Simple Simon would perhapse have explained 
to a questioner that he had read it every morning for forty years without 
once failing to find something new in it, while the exact contrary had proved 
true of the Times or the Telegraph.</P>

<P>He was still engaged in this occupation when the telephone rang.&nbsp; "Mr. 
Philipps speaking," said the voice.&nbsp; "I hope you remember meeting me at 
dinner at Fleming's last month.&nbsp; I hope I haven't awaken you too 
early.&nbsp; The fact is I've had a most mysterious and threatening 
communication this morning, and I want to trespass on your kindness by 
consulting you."</P>

<P>"Come right round!" said Simon genially.&nbsp; "You won't mind a 
dressing-gown, will you?"&nbsp; Philipps replied that he would be at the house 
in ten minutes, and Simon, laying down the 'newspaper', rushed through his 
bath, and was found sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, by his 
visitor.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Philip P. Philipps junior had just succeeded to an important wholesale 
jewellery business on the death of his father, which had taken place a 
fortnight before his visit to Simple Simon.&nbsp; He was a prosperous citizen 
of 45 years of age, with a wife and family; a typical burgess, but attractive 
to Simon Iff on account of his extraordinary knowledge of the history of 
famous gems.&nbsp; On this he had expatiated eloquently at the dinner 
referred to in his telephone conversation, and Iff, delighted, had expressed 
the hope that one day he might be of some service.</P>

<P>This opportunity had now come.&nbsp; Philipps drew a letter from his 
pocket, and handed it silently to the old man.</P>

<P>Iff contemplated it at length.</P>

<P>The message was short and simple.</P>

<P>"Don't monky with the buz-saw."</P>

<P>"No idea of origin or purport?" asked Simon.</P>

<P>"None."</P>

<P>"Then let me think."</P>

<P>The mystic examined the letter with fresh care.&nbsp; He even smelt it 
carefully, and tested it in one or two spots with the tip of his tongue.&nbsp; 
Then he wrapped himself anew in the voluminous folds of his grey silk robe 
with its dull gold embroidery.&nbsp; Even his head disappeared.&nbsp; It was 
five minutes before he emerged.</P>

<P>"This," said he slowly, "appears to be from Jonathan Spratt."</P>

<P>Philipps sat staggered for a few moments.&nbsp; Then the one possible 
conclusion forced itself into his mind, and thence through his speech.&nbsp; 
"You're in with this gang!" he exclaimed.</P>

<P>"Oh no!" said Simon, laughing.&nbsp; "I'm only telling you what the letter 
tells me."</P>

<P>"I beg your pardon.&nbsp; But it's perfectly impossible that you should get 
the name of the writer."</P>

<P>"Not a bit.&nbsp; Please follow the thought.&nbsp; A common paper - common 
man.&nbsp; Letters formed clumsily - learnt to write late in life.</P>

<P>"Shaky lettering - elderly man, or a sick one.</P>

<P>"Hasty lettering - not a sick man, therefore elderly.</P>

<P>"Post mark Hoboken - suggests a sailor.</P>

<P>"Paper smells of fo'o'sle - unmistakeable - letter written on ship, or 
soon after landing.</P>

<P>"Characters printed - man wants to conceal identity.</P>

<P>"Letters perfectly aligned - what uneducated man would do that - but a 
carpenter?</P>

<P>"It is sealed with shellac - just what a carpenter would have handy, and 
it's written with what looks to me like a carpenter's pencil.&nbsp; Letter 
bears special delivery stamp - evidence of urgent haste.&nbsp; Why not 
telegram, telephone, or special messenger?&nbsp; Easier to trace sender.&nbsp; 
Why haste?&nbsp; Result of previous delay.&nbsp; Afraid he'll be too late.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, he has only just got the information on which his letter is 
based.&nbsp; Or both.</P>

<P>"These conditions will all be fulfilled if we suppose an elderly ship's 
carpenter to have landed at Hoboken this morning from some distant port.&nbsp; 
Does the letter tell us anything about the ship?</P>

<P>"There is a smear of oil - a kind of oil that is only used for big 
engines.&nbsp; And I think there is only one big ship that docked in Hoboken 
this morning; the Hyrcania; and she was three days late.</P>

<P>"Now just before I left for America I travelled on the Hyrcania from 
Naples to Marseilles; and I got to know the carpenter, whose name was Jonathan 
Spratt.&nbsp; Is that clear?"</P>

<P>"It all corresponds, of course," said Philipps rather doubtfully.</P>

<P>"Obviously, my friend the carpenter may have been superseded.&nbsp; But, 
as it happens, I have reasons for thinking that it is the same man - I'll tell 
you in a minute.</P>

<P>"Rather unworthy to spring the name on you as I did, of course:&nbsp; but I 
never resist temptation when miracles are on the carpet ...."</P>

<P>"A most strikingly fortunate coincidence, at least." replied the Jeweller 
seriously.</P>

<P>"Not very.&nbsp; We have the man and his job, and could find his name, did 
we lack it, in an hour.&nbsp; After all, the name matters little ...."</P>

<P>Simon Iff pulled himself up short with a snarl, the blood flooded his 
cheeks.&nbsp; He ground his teeth.&nbsp; His eyes were suddenly misty with a 
film of tears, as, casting out the shame of his precipitate judgement, there 
came the vision of a pale sad frightened girl ... "Claudine," he muttered.&nbsp; 
"Too extraordinary - if a name could be of virtue here as well ..."</P>

<P>He sank into deep thought.&nbsp; "Jonathan," he murmured.&nbsp; "David 
...?&nbsp; A little honey on a rod ...?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I'm an old fool.&nbsp; 
The name is common enough, and the man no such unusual type.&nbsp; I mustn't 
lose my grip, and look for light and leading in every Will o' the Wisp."</P>

<P>Philipps had picked up the letter and examined it carefully.&nbsp; "Yes, I 
dare say you're right.&nbsp; But ...."&nbsp; He did not know how to conclude 
his sentence.&nbsp; Iff's identification had merely replaced a superficial 
puzzle by a genuine problem.</P>

<P>The magician looked up, gleefully at the thought he read in the other man's 
mind.</P>

<P>"But, as you are about to say, it doesn't in the least explain why a 
perfect stranger should send you a threatening message in such a deuce of a 
hurry.&nbsp; You weren't intending to monkey with a buzz-saw, were you?"</P>

<P>"My relations with the whole world are absolutely peaceful."</P>

<P>"No big business pending?"</P>

<P>"The season's over; nothing doing for three months to come."</P>

<P>"I remember Jonathan Spratt as a singularly shrewd, sane, cautious man.&nbsp; 
The precautions in this letter agree there too.&nbsp; Whence the excitement, 
and the perfectly pointless threat or warning?"</P>

<P>"It's inexplicable."</P>

<P>"I think not.&nbsp; The man has been abroad for some time.&nbsp; He may not 
know of your bereavement."</P>

<P>"It might be intended for my father?" cried Philipps.</P>

<P>Iff nodded.&nbsp; But the jeweller's face fell again.</P>

<P>"The poor old gentleman had taken no active part in the business for five 
years.&nbsp; He had practically no communication with the outside world.&nbsp; 
He would sit in the house all day and play with his collection of gems.&nbsp; 
He hardly ever went out.&nbsp; Sometimes he would play chess with a crony.&nbsp; 
He was the one man in the world unlikely to monkey with a buzz-saw!"</P>

<P>"Yes, I'll tell you one other thing.&nbsp; Jonathan Spratt, though a 
self-educated man, was a very thoroughly educated man, within his limits.&nbsp; 
The nature of the letter confirms that.&nbsp; A man must have read widely, and 
thought deeply, to invent so cryptic a plan.&nbsp; He would certainly not have 
spelt monkey without an 'e' or buzz with only one 'z', unless he had a 
particular reason for it.&nbsp; In short, I think it's some kind of a 
cipher.&nbsp; Spratt knew a little about the subject, by the way.&nbsp; The 
occasion of my employing him was the making of some fretwork stencils which I 
designed to offer to the Government for a particular object which we had in 
view.&nbsp; So we got to chatting over the subject; he knew several capital 
methods.&nbsp; Your father would probably have understood the purport of this 
paper."</P>

<P>"I can't imagine what my father would be doing with this Spratt!"</P>

<P>"Used him to catch whales, perhaps!&nbsp; The old man was a very keen 
collector, wasn't he?&nbsp; Suppose he employed Spratt to smuggle precious 
stones?&nbsp; A clever tool; trustworthy, prudent, ingenious, silent; all 
one could desire!&nbsp; Then suppose the letter was meant to convey exactly 
what it did not say:&nbsp; the letters omitted instead of those expressed:&nbsp; 
in plain American, E. Z. 'Easy' would have told your father that he had had no 
trouble with the Custom House people, and perhaps advised him to take certain 
prearranged steps for the transference of the smuggled stuff.&nbsp; The haste 
is now fully accounted for; he must have feared that your father would be 
anxious, as the ship was so late.&nbsp; Or, possibly, he had promised to make 
good on a definite day."</P>

<P>"It's all in the air, of course."</P>

<P>"I've caught many a ten-pound trout on single gut.&nbsp; We can test it by 
having Jonathan arrested.&nbsp; He wouldn't risk the Bhopur Emerald anywhere 
but on his person."</P>

<P>"The Bhopur Emerald?"</P>

<P>"That is the only recently stolen stone which I can think of as likely to 
interest your father.&nbsp; The thieves were traced to Alexandria, you 
know.&nbsp; So likely enough Jonathan got his little job through at Naples 
while the Hyrcania was in harbour."</P>

<P>"But why have him arrested?"</P>

<P>"He's broken the law, hasn't he?&nbsp; Or do you want the stone?"</P>

<P>"I suppose my father paid for it.&nbsp; I don't mind paying the duty."</P>

<P>"A stolen stone?"</P>

<P>"Oh, the Rajah of Bhopur's a nigger."</P>

<P>"In India, my dear sir, the people enjoy the advantages of religion, 
morals, art, literature and good manners.&nbsp; When I notice these, my second 
glance will embrace telephones and tall buildings.&nbsp; Incidentally, his 
complexion is considerably fairer than either yours or mine."</P>

<P>Philipps whinced.&nbsp; "Right's right," he said rather angrily.</P>

<P>"True," said Iff.&nbsp; "But allow me to pass you a copy of the Jewish and 
Christian scriptures.&nbsp; You will there find many texts of a character to 
buttress your case.&nbsp; Thou shalt not steal and Thou shalt not kill are 
followed by many illustrations of the wrath of Jehovah against various people 
who didn't steal and kill - when the victims were 'heathen'.&nbsp; Does that 
help you?"</P>

<P>"It does," said Philipps.&nbsp; "We cannot go against the Word of God."</P>

<P>"Speak for yourself," said Simon Iff.&nbsp; "I am now going to call up the 
Custom House People, and the Police.&nbsp; Here is your letter.&nbsp; It's for 
you after all:&nbsp; don't monkey with a buzz-saw!"</P>

<P>Philipps went away in a black fury.&nbsp; He saw - not red, but green!&nbsp; 
A passion to acquire the famous Bhopur Emerald swept through his whole 
being.&nbsp; He had not a moment to lose! he must find Jonathan Spratt.&nbsp; 
What arrangements could his father possibly have made?&nbsp; The only hope was 
to go home and rummage among the dead man's papers.</P>

<P>Simon Iff, having done his duty by Law and Order on the telephone, returned 
to the perusal of the 'newspaper'.</P>

<P><CENTER>II</CENTER></P>

<P>Mr. Philip P. Philipps was disturbed in his search among his father's 
papers by the arrival of the midday mail.</P>

<P>One letter stood out from the rest like the sun among the stars - it was 
the printed pencil of Jonathan Spratt.&nbsp; Philipps tore it open with crazy 
anxiety.&nbsp; But the contents was nothing but a chess diagram.</P>

<P>It was a perfectly conventional chess problem, motto, author, and 
description complete; but Philipps had no difficulty in understanding that 
here was another ingenious cipher.</P>

<P>And the only man - probably - capable of solving it had just turned him out 
of the house for a thief!</P>

<P>But Philip P. Philipps had inherited some of his father's slyness and 
resourcefulness.&nbsp; He thought of a friend named Bloom who - so he was wont 
to boast - knew Simon Iff very well.&nbsp; He would copy the paper, and take 
it to him, asking him to show it to Iff and ask for a solution.&nbsp; In case 
the old magician played him false (for he could not imagine anybody being 
straight) and went personally to the assignation - he was certain the 
'problem' was a cipher time and place - he would have him followed by two sure 
men whom he had often employed to guard packets of jewels.&nbsp; He himself 
would wait at home, on the chance of Jonathan Spratt turning up in person.&nbsp; 
Having made these arrangements, he went on with his search through the papers, 
but discovered nothing connected with the matter, unless the dozens of odd 
chess diagrams were also part of it.</P>

<P>Bloom rang up Simon Iff at his friend's request, and arranged, quite 
casually, for a meeting at the club that afternoon.&nbsp; The sleuths were on 
the mystic's trail before he left the house, determined to follow to the 
death.</P>

<P>Bloom talked of many casual things; it was only by apparent chance that, in 
pulling out his cigar-case, the chess problem came with it.</P>

<P>"By the way, you're a chess fiend, aren't you?&nbsp; This seems in your 
line."</P>

<P>Simon Iff picked up the paper and studied it carefully.&nbsp; "These 
seven-movers are a bit out of date," he said at last, "and I'm a bit out of 
practice at them in consequence; they were all the rage when I was a 
boy.&nbsp; You don't play, I think?"</P>

<P>"No," replied the innocent Bloom.</P>

<P>"How did you get this?"</P>

<P>"Found it the other day as I was turning over some old papers."</P>

<P>"And made a copy of it this morning, all for my benefit?"</P>

<P>Bloom began to stammer.&nbsp; "I - er - that is - you see - ah - just 
so.&nbsp; The original was very nearly worn out."</P>

<P>"Don't you know me well enough to tell me the true story?"</P>

<P>"Well - er - a friend bet me you could solve it, and I wouldn't believe 
it."</P>

<P>That was true, so far as it went.</P>

<P>"I suppose this was in strict confidence?"</P>

<P>"Yes," gasped Bloom, grasping at the sorry straw.</P>

<P>"Very peculiar," remarked Simon.&nbsp; "Only this morning a friend of yours 
showed me a cipher, of a nature that made me expect a second cipher to 
follow.&nbsp; And here we are; only, instead of a cipher, we have a chess 
problem.&nbsp; And between you and me, it's a pretty poor problem, if it's 
solvable at all, which I doubt.&nbsp; Suppose it were the cipher after all?"</P>

<P>"Suppose it were?" echoed Bloom helplessly.</P>

<P>"Well, if it's a cipher, it's as plain as print."</P>

<P>"And what does it mean, then?"</P>

<P>"I think your friend Mr. Philip P. Philipps is more of a fool than a 
knave.&nbsp; With your permission, I will show this little problem to 
Commissioner Teake, whom I perceive in yonder window.&nbsp; If he chooses to 
tell you, I have no objection."</P>

<P>"I say, you can't do that, you know!&nbsp; That's my paper!"</P>

<P>"Your loyalty is honourable, but its source is in your ignorance.&nbsp; 
Your Mr. Philipps is making you accessory to a felony.&nbsp; Ask him to show 
you the first cipher:&nbsp; don't monkey with the buzz-saw.&nbsp; Here, don't 
be an ass, come across with me, and tell Teake all you know!"</P>

<P>Bloom surrendered.&nbsp; But his information was meagre enough; Philipps, 
with an imbecile's false cunning, had told him nothing, not even prompted a 
plausible explanation.</P>

<P>"I don't know whether I ought not to hold you," said Teake, "if only as a 
material witness."</P>

<P>"Let him go!" urged Iff; "he's the most immaterial witness I ever saw in my 
life."</P>

<P>So they stood him a drink, to show there was no ill feeling; and off he 
went with his tail between his legs.</P>

<P>"I can make nothing of this, Mr. Iff," said Teake.</P>

<P>"Oh, surely you can.&nbsp; The only difficulty is that it doesn't look like 
a cipher.&nbsp; Once suspect it, and it blossoms into flower."</P>

<P>"Well, the Bloom's off the peach," grinned the Commissioner, to the horror 
and agony of the magician.</P>

<P>"It might of course be a dictionary cipher," explained he; "you've only got 
to number the squares from 1 to 64, and your pieces from 1 to 12 - 6 white and 
6 black pieces diverse - and mark up words in a dictionary accordingly.&nbsp; 
But the number of words is very limited, and you would need an extra code to 
account for the order; the whole scheme would be inefficient and clumsy, 
though it might serve some special object.</P>

<P>"However, that's barred, because it would need an incredible coincidence to 
have the code message appear as even you, who don't play chess at all, see it 
appear - or will, in a minute or so.&nbsp; Come now, doesn't the arrangement 
of the pieces strike you as peculiar?"</P>

<P>"So would any arrangement.&nbsp; The pieces mean nothing whatever to 
me."</P>

<P>"Oh yes, they do.&nbsp; Forget about their being chessmen; think of them 
simply as a child would."</P>

<P>"Oh!" cried Teake.&nbsp; "What an ass I am!"</P>

<P>"Every article marked in plain figures!"</P>

<P>"4315.&nbsp; But what's that?"</P>

<P>"Safe bind, safe find!&nbsp; Otherwise, memorandum about a safe where 
something is put away."</P>

<P>"I see.&nbsp; And it has something to do with this Philipps-Spratt 
business - um!&nbsp; But where's the safe?"</P>

<P>"Possibly 'by R. W. Waterton?'&nbsp; Either a third party - which I doubt, 
these people not needing assistance, so far as I can see - or an address.&nbsp; 
R might stand for 18 and W for 23.&nbsp; Is there a Waterton Street in these 
parts?&nbsp; Or a West Waterton Street?"</P>

<P>"Probably, I'll find out."&nbsp; He took a table telephone and called up 
headquarters.&nbsp; Yes, there was a Waterton Street in Hoboken.&nbsp; "Get 
the officer, and have him call me here - Chiliad Club."</P>

<P>Two minutes later the officer on the Waterton Street beat rang through.&nbsp; 
Among the tenants of No. 1823 was a watchmaker, Aminadab Spratt, a bachelor, 
steady, decent, sober, reputed to have saved much money.</P>

<P>"A hot trail," said the Commissioner to Iff, as he replaced the 
receiver.&nbsp; "What do we do now?&nbsp; Raid 'em?"</P>

<P>"I think that 'seven moves' may mean 'call at seven o'clock'.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, it's part of the combination.&nbsp; I expect Aminadab as a brother 
of Jonathan - pious kind of a family, eh? - and lets him keep a safe in the 
place to store things while he's away at sea."</P>

<P>"I think I see the idea now.&nbsp; Jonathan daren't meet Philipps, so he 
tells him to call at this house.&nbsp; Very likely, as you say, at seven 
o'clock, to make sure Aminadab is at home.&nbsp; He would describe old 
Philipps, and the latter's knowledge of the combination would make all 
secure."</P>

<P>"Exactly my idea."</P>

<P>"But why risk sending the figures?&nbsp; Why not leave word with his 
brother?"</P>

<P>"As man to man, Teake, would you trust a plugged nickel to any one named 
Aminadab Spratt?"</P>

<P>Teake laughed.&nbsp; "I guess you're right.&nbsp; So we'll time the raid 
for seven.&nbsp; I'll call up."</P>

<P>Two detective inspectors were waiting for the Commissioner and his friend 
as they came out of the club after a hasty dinner, saluted, and got into the 
car with them.&nbsp; The sleuths of Mr. Philipps looked at each other.&nbsp; 
They were not exactly out to follow the Commissioner of Police; they might 
thank their stars he wasn't following them.&nbsp; So they went over to 
Philipps' house and reported their discomfiture.</P>

<P>"That cipher was right the first time," he said comically.&nbsp; "E. Z.'s 
all wrong, but he certainly got the right dope about the buzz-saw!"</P>

<P>Precisely at seven o'clock the police car drew up before No. 1823 Waterton 
Street.&nbsp; They had enlisted the aid of the Chief of the Hoboken 
Police.&nbsp; The little party entered, and a number of constables quietly 
moved into position.</P>

<P>But no such precautions were necessary.&nbsp; Aminadab Spratt rose and 
received the Chief and the Commissioner with perfect calm and respect.</P>

<P>"You are Aminadab Spratt?"</P>

<P>"Yep, your honour."</P>

<P>"I am the Chief of Police.&nbsp; I have a warrant to search this house."</P>

<P>"Yep, your honour."</P>

<P>"You have a brother named Jonathan?"</P>

<P>There was a moment's pause.</P>

<P>"Cousin, your honour."</P>

<P>"Does he rent a safe with you?"</P>

<P>"Yep, your honour.&nbsp; It's behind that rubbish in the corner."</P>

<P>The two detective inspectors went forward, and cleared the spot 
indicated.&nbsp; Let into the wall was a safe of recent pattern, excellently 
made.</P>

<P>Teake himself operated the combination.&nbsp; In the meantime Simon Iff had 
fraternized with the watchmaker.&nbsp; The mystic carried a 'perpetual motion' 
watch, wound by a steel weight which rises and falls as the wearer moves in 
walking.</P>

<P>"I have to walk five miles a day," he explained to Aminadab; "so I keep my 
watch wound and my waist slender by the same healthful procedure.&nbsp; Have 
you ever seen Ozanam's mercurial water-clock, or a copy?"</P>

<P>Aminadab admitted cheerfully that he had.</P>

<P>"If you had had one here," said Simon, "you would have been able to tell me 
exactly at what time your brother - I mean cousin - looked in to-day.&nbsp; 
The second time, I mean."</P>

<P>"So that's what you're getting at, Mister."</P>

<P>"Yes; I noticed your quiet amusement at the futile proceedings of our 
friends in the corner."</P>

<P>Teake was just in the act of stooping to open the safe, with an electric 
torch held to the dial by one of the inspectors.</P>

<P>He looked up over his shoulder with a quick startled face.</P>

<P>"What's that?" he snapped.</P>

<P>"Go on, go on.&nbsp; Try all things; hold fast that which is good!"&nbsp; 
This was in Simon Iff's most ironical tones.</P>

<P>Aminadab laughed outright.&nbsp; Teake went at the safe like a whirlwind.</P>

<P>The door swung open.&nbsp; The safe was furnished as a correct and chaste 
imitation of Old Mother Hubbard's celebrated cupboard.</P>

<P>"Damn it!" said Teake in a rage, "you led me into this, Iff.&nbsp; This is 
as bad as that damned foolishness with Mr. Noon."</P>

<P>"Oh no!" said Simon.&nbsp; "Iff's only for short.&nbsp; The whole of it is 
'Iff at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again!'"</P>

<P>He seized Amindab Spratt by the waist, and executed a blithe polka.&nbsp; 
It went very much against the grain of so sober and respectable a watchmaker; 
but he supposed Iff to be drunk.</P>

<P>The Commissioner was not to be pacified.&nbsp; His colleague from Hoboken 
was smirking too broadly.</P>

<P>"We'll hold this Spratt, I guess, on suspicion."</P>

<P>"Suspicion of smiling to himself?&nbsp; We come here on the evidence of an 
alleged chess problem sent by some unknown person to a man named Philipps who 
has nothing to do with the place; and we've got to take under our wing tra-la, 
a most unattractive old thing, tra-la, with a caricature of a - case!&nbsp; 
We find nothing where no sane person would have expected to find anything; 
and yet we must arrest the unhapy Aminadab.&nbsp; For shame!"</P>

<P>"Damn it, which side are you on?&nbsp; The whole thing has hung together 
miraculously till now."</P>

<P>"My dear friend, it hangs still better.&nbsp; Aminadab's smile - a very 
sweet smile, mark you, and passing subtle - told me that the Bhopur Emerald 
had been here to-day.&nbsp; Then why isn't it here now?&nbsp; Jonathan learnt 
somehow that old Philipps was dead.&nbsp; There was his cipher out in the cold 
world.&nbsp; It might fall into the wrong hands - as in fact it did.&nbsp; The 
only course open to him was to hurry back and remove the stone."</P>

<P>Aminadab's expression had altered.&nbsp; It had not struck him until then 
how strange it was that the hour of the assignation should be known, and the 
combination of the safe.</P>

<P>"Your brother - cousin, I mean - boasted of the safety of his ciphers, I 
imagine?&nbsp; Be a sensible man, now; can't you see what you're up 
against?&nbsp; Don't monkey with the buzz-saw!&nbsp; I've tried to save you 
from arrest; now, what time did your brother - er - cousin take the emerald 
away?"</P>

<P>"About an hour ago," grumbled Aminadab.</P>

<P>"Which way did he go?"</P>

<P>"I don't know."</P>

<P>"But he was an emerald thief - and an impertinet one, surely?"</P>

<P>"What do you mean?"</P>

<P>"I was joking.&nbsp; Of course you couldn't know.&nbsp; But you must know 
what you did with the body."</P>

<P>Aminadab Spratt collapsed into the arms of the detective who stood by 
him.</P>

<P>"Brandy," said Iff.&nbsp; "Put him in a chair."</P>

<P>"Sure we will," observed Teake playfully, "unless this is another of your 
'purely theoretical' arrests 'for the instruction of rising Police 
Commissioners', I think you said."&nbsp; He was still a little sore, and Iff's 
lightning developments were on his nerves.</P>

<P>"Better now?" asked Simon.&nbsp; Aminadab's face had some colour in it, 
from the stiff dose of brandy which the Chief had poured between his 
teeth.&nbsp; He held hysterically to the arms of the chair in which they had 
seated him.&nbsp; Then he saw Iff's sardonic grin, as the mystic's eyes fell 
on those tightened muscles, and he sprang up with a shriek of horror.</P>

<P>"Sit down!" said Iff, sternly.</P>

<P>"No, no!" he yelled, "you shan't kill me; you've no right to kill me."</P>

<P>"Is that remark original with you?"</P>

<P>Spratt clenched his teeth, and said no word.</P>

<P>"I should arrest him, sir, and warn him in the usual way."</P>

<P>"This is absolutely serious?" said the Chief of Police.&nbsp; "You 
understand what this means?&nbsp; I can't even see a ground of suspicion.&nbsp; 
Incidentally, we haven't found a dead body yet."</P>

<P>"Oh technicality!&nbsp; What a blessed word is Mesopotamia!&nbsp; Keep him 
till I find the emerald!&nbsp; Fie, Amindab, your eyes are wandering again 
just where they shouldn't.&nbsp; Near the kitchenette.&nbsp; Ah! the galled 
jade winces; this is perhaps our young friend's first serious crime.&nbsp; Now, 
Teake, use your brains!&nbsp; Where would a watchmaker hide an emerald in a 
kitchenette?"</P>

<P>Simon threw open the doors.&nbsp; "Bread?&nbsp; No; you can't join up bread 
neatly.&nbsp; A watchmaker, remember!&nbsp; What be these?&nbsp; Eggs.&nbsp; 
And have we not invisible cements, we watchmakers?&nbsp; I'll take a chance on 
an egg."</P>

<P>He banged the box upon the table.&nbsp; The eggs broke, flowed every 
way.&nbsp; And in the midst behold! the Bhopur Emerald.</P>

<P>"Now can't you arrest him under the Sullivan Law for carrying concealed 
eggs - which are notoriously weapons - in politics?&nbsp; Or for being in 
possession of narcotic eggs?&nbsp; I often go to sleep after a debauch on 
Omlette Espagnole ...."</P>

<P>But they had already arrested him.</P>

<P>"Good!" continued Simon, turning to observe, at the click of the handcuffs, 
"let me now continue my prolix yet informative discourse.&nbsp; Seventeenthly, 
I noticed that Amindab - lovely name! - while very much amused at our 
preoccupation with the safe, became quite serious when I spoke of his 
brother's - I mean his cousin's - movements.&nbsp; Forty-fifthly, he changed 
his position in the room rather furtively, immediately afterwards.&nbsp; He 
strongly resented my whirling him away to the strains of the Blue Danube; 
possibly because he doesn't like Austrians; possibly not.&nbsp; Why this fuss 
about his position?&nbsp; Did it remind me of that chess problem?&nbsp; 
(Position is everything in chess, don't you know?)&nbsp; No, gentlemen, it did 
not.&nbsp; Still, I wondered.&nbsp; It had occurred to me that Jonathan's 
refusal to trust his brother - er, cousin - with the combination of the safe 
was unflattering - and I knew Jonathan for a most prudent man.&nbsp; And then 
I thought that Jonathan was not so scared because old Philipps' death sent his 
ciphers astray - he probably believed in his ciphers - but because old 
Phillips was the man behind the gun.&nbsp; Not a fool like his fat son, oh 
no!&nbsp; He had built up that business from nothing; it's one of America's 
standard examples; and he was carrying on all this funny business on the sly 
under his son's nose, though he was in his dotage.&nbsp; A big man in his way, 
old Philipps!&nbsp; The Spratts didn't dare to go against him.&nbsp; But, 
Philipps dead, nobody knew of this emerald but Jonathan and Aminadab.&nbsp; I 
have told you now prudent Jonathan was:&nbsp; he must have realized instantly 
that if his cousin - or was it brother, Mr. Spratt?"<?P>

<P>The man in the chair drew his breath heavily.</P>

<P>"My first suspicion was your tone when you said cousin.&nbsp; You could not 
bear to think of him as brother - why?&nbsp; Does 'cousin' lighten your burden, 
does 'cousin' efface the brand of Cain, oh you whose father brought you up 
upon the Bible?"</P>

<P>Simon Iff was tense and inflamed, a modern Issiah.&nbsp; He dropped, as 
suddenly as he had risen, to a bantering tone.</P>

<P>"Well, as I was saying, dearly beloved brethren, umeyumthly*, if Aminadab 
knew that Philipps was no longer there to avenge bad faith, he would force the 
safe and be off with the emerald.&nbsp; There is no time to lose; the 
non-arrival of Philipps at seven o'clock might put some such thought in Cain's 
mind.&nbsp; So Abel hurries back.&nbsp; But his action arouses Cain's 
suspicions.&nbsp; Perhaps Abel tells him that the plan is changed, or that 
there is danger.&nbsp; Yet surely the danger was for Abel to be near the 
stone.&nbsp; Cain smells a rat; he will strike a blow for the great prize."</P>

<P>He stopped, out of breath.</P>

<P>"This is all the merest surmise, Mr. Iff," said the Chief of Police, a 
little annoyed again.</P>

<P>"Be patient.&nbsp; I produced the emerald.&nbsp; Faith is the substance of 
things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&nbsp; This surmise ambling 
aimiably about my vacant cranium, my thought wandering still further, right 
back to the question of Cain's position on the floor ...."</P>

<P>Aminadab Spratt uttered an inarticulate cry.</P>

<P>"You are a tidy man, Son of Adam!" said Simon Iff.&nbsp; "Your hands are 
washed, your hair is trimmed, your chin is smooth, your collar is white, your 
dress is neat, your tools betray every evidence of loving care.&nbsp; But the 
room itself, apart from your person and your trade, is singularly unkempt.&nbsp; 
I have often remarked this trait in persons devoted to some skilled 
profession.&nbsp; Yet, sometimes, such persons notice quite suddenly how badly 
their surroundings need cleanliness and order.&nbsp; They transform 
themselves into veritable demons of spring cleaning.&nbsp; Of course it is as  
bad as ever in a week.&nbsp; Amusing to observe, eh?&nbsp; Well, gentlemen, 
kindly direct your eyes to the position so carefully taken up by Cain.&nbsp; 
Do you see that small patch of floor, recently scrubbed, an hour or so ago, 
still damp, dust from other parts of the room brushed over it?&nbsp; You 
scrubbed well, Cain, I doubt not; you scrubbed for dear life; but will 
cleansing a floor cleanse your hands?"</P>

<P>Again he shot prophetic thunderbolts of tone upon the prisoner.</P>

<P>"I expect a microscope would show blood still - in the cracks anyhow."</P>

<P>Again he towered over Aminadab Spratt.</P>

<P>"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.&nbsp; 
Where is thy brother Abel?"</P>

<P>"I put the body in the water-tank on the roof," said the murderer.&nbsp; 
"The hammer is there too.&nbsp; I meant to have got it away to-night in my 
Ford.&nbsp; He wouldn't have been missed; he'd been paid off from the ship; 
old Philipps was to have paid him twenty thousand for the emerald, and he had 
money saved besides.&nbsp; Oh, don't look at me, don't look at me!" he cried 
piteously to Iff.&nbsp; "All this time your eyes have tortured me, and your 
voice saying 'Cain!' and a voice inside me beating, beating, beating with my 
heart 'Thou God seest me!'"</P>

<P>Simon Iff turned away his eyes.&nbsp; The Chief of Police and the two 
inspectors led away the murderer to his doom.</P>

<P>Teak saw with wonder that Simple Simon's eyes had shifted from the mood of 
Sinai to that of Bethlehem.</P>

<P>"Why, man, you're crying!" he said in amazement.&nbsp; "I don't see 
anything to cry about."</P>

<P>"I know you don't," replied the mystic, "and that is one more reason why 
I'm crying.&nbsp; You can't see the agony of humanity.&nbsp; We're all 
monkeys, with fate as the buzz-saw!&nbsp; Oh frail ladder that leads up from 
the beast to the God, how slippery are thy rungs!&nbsp; That man fell in one 
moment from a hard-working, worthy life to a most shameful death.&nbsp; 
Humanity itself might so fall from the summit of civilization to a primeval 
barbarism.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I see it coming.&nbsp; This Count Zeppelin, 
you know, and the people who are working on the submarine.&nbsp; Ever think 
what they may lead to?&nbsp; No, Teake, let us go out under the stars with 
pure hearts, gazing with agony on him who has gone to his death.&nbsp; I 
caught him and I killed him, my brother, even as he killed his brother, like 
a lion springing upon a deer.&nbsp; So, as Charles Baxter or somebody once 
said, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Simon Iff.'&nbsp; Come!"</P>

<P>Teake followed in silence, shaken by an awe whose nature he hardly 
understood.</P>

<P>"Don't forget the emerald!" chirped Simple Simon over his shoulder; "it 
belongs to the Rajah of Bhopur, a very dear friend of mine, a very dear 
man.&nbsp; One of the best!"</P>
