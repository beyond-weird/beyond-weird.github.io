<P>Miss Mollie Madison was dressed in a cream-coloured frock.&nbsp; It was 
decidedly daring with her emeralds and her blazing hair.&nbsp; But it 
satisfied the eye of Simon Iff, and that was the great point at issue.</P>

<P>For a terrible disaster had befallen him.&nbsp; His colleague, Captain 
Lascelles of the British Navy, had fallen sick, and there was nothing to be 
done in the way of regular work till he recovered.&nbsp; He had therefore the 
option of going into a trance, or of finding some amusement.&nbsp; The words 
"Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do," had come into his 
mind, and he, taking this as an inspiration, and reflecting that no mischief 
could be so mischievous as Miss Mollie Madison, had asked her to come round.</P>

<P>"Tell me anything but the Old Old Story," he exclaimed, "I'm bored to tears; 
don't you know any old thing like that Pasquaney Puzzle?"</P>

<P>She went to fetch her vanity bag, and proceeded to extract a letter.</P>

<P>"Dolores wrote me this the other day," she said, and began to read.</P>

<P>"The infernal genius of this cat!" cried Simon.&nbsp; "How dare you flaunt 
your very trickery in my face? I must be a lost soul."</P>

<P>She shook her finger, the one with the great cabochon emerald, at him.</P>

<P>"Do you wonder we're not truthful, when you talk like that when we are?"</P>

<P>"I admit that when a man understands a woman, he tries to put an ocean or 
two between them.&nbsp; However, you had better 'tide me over'.&nbsp; <I>Qualis

<P>"Listen to the tale of A. B. Smith of Potter's Place, Massachusetts.&nbsp; 
Four years ago, June 23, 1907, at precisely 8 o'clock on a Sunday evening, 
came the climax.&nbsp; One week earlier, A. B. Smith had reached the fifty 
third year of his age.&nbsp; During all that period nothing had ever happened 
to him, or to his.&nbsp; His parents were farmers, decent people in moderate 
circumstances, his uncle an Episcopalian minister.&nbsp; Potter's Place is a 
cross-road, of no importance or interest to anybody beyond the local
worthies.&nbsp;
There is a railway station, where the less fortunate or skilful trains 
occasionally stop.</P>

<P>"A. B. Smith inherited his father's farm, and his uncle's library.&nbsp; He 
had a good education in Boston, and took a mild interest in butterflies.&nbsp; 
He married Matilda, the only daughter of Farmer Jones across the valley, when 
he was 20 and she 21.&nbsp; Their union was blessed by two children, a son 
William and a daughter Mary.&nbsp; The birth of Mary had been a serious risk 
for the mother; she lay ill for months.&nbsp; Two operations were necessary to 
save her life, and she was never her own woman again, but sank rapidly into 
age and infirmity.</P>

<P>"With advancing years A. B. Smith became a substantial man.&nbsp; He had no 
energy or ambition; he just drifted into prosperity with the rest of the 
country; he became more absorbed in reading and in entomology; and, leaving 
the farm in William's very capable hands, built himself a house on the side of 
a hill, a mile from the next dwelling.&nbsp; It is situated on a grassy slope, 
with hardly any trees.&nbsp; It is a substantial building, but not very large; 
Mary and her mother tended it without assistance.&nbsp; They moved to this 
house in 1899.</P>

<P>"William, assisted by a capable manager, lived on in the old farmhouse.&nbsp; 
He was 30 years of age in 1907; Mary was a year younger.&nbsp; Neither of the 
children had any more imagination than the parents.&nbsp; They had not even 
fallen in love, though William was supposed to be 'getting acquainted' with 
the innkeeper's daughter.&nbsp; That is, he called on her most evenings, and 
said nothing particular.&nbsp; On Sundays, meeting his family at church, he 
would invariably return to the new house for dinner.&nbsp; He would pass the 
afternoon in relating the news of the week, for his father rarely left the 
garden, which he was very fond of tending in an amateur way, and after an 
evening collation, walk home to the farm to bed.&nbsp; In fine weather his 
family would walk part of the way with him.</P>

<P>"A. B. Smith had suffered slightly from rheumatism, and now and then 
(though by no means always) walked with a stick.</P>

<P>"On June 23, 1907, this placid ritual had reached the point where they 
were all leaving the house.&nbsp; The evening was fine, warm, and windless.&nbsp; 
They left the door open behind them.</P>

<P>"A. B. Smith, walking on his daughter's arm behind his wife and son, was 
just thirty two yards from the door when he said, 'I think I'll get my cane, 
Mame,' and went back.&nbsp; The others waited.&nbsp; They saw him enter the 
house.&nbsp; He never came out again; from that day to this there has been 
absolutely no clue or trace of him of any kind."<P>

<P>"Is that all?" said Simon, seeing her fold up the paper.</P>

<P>"That's all."</P>

<P>"Very uninteresting.&nbsp; You don't tell me a single pertinent fact.&nbsp; 
Where was the stick he went to get, in the first place? What about other 
exits to the house, for the second? Then--oh, there are fifty points I want 
to know!"</P>

<P>"I don't know about the stick.&nbsp; I saw the house, though.&nbsp; There 
is only the one entrance; the back door merely leads to the woodpile.&nbsp; 
It is a long one-story building, cut into the hillside for shelter.&nbsp; It 
would take a very fine climber to get up the perpendicular shale behind the 
house, and nobody could possibly do it unobserved.&nbsp; The family naturally 
enough had turned to watch at once for the father's return; the old lady 
called out only a minute or so after he had entered, impatient of delay; and 
she sent Mary to look almost immediately afterwards, as he did not reply.&nbsp; 
She could not have taken a minute to fail to find him, in that small house; 
and she came out, with awe and wonder already upon her, to raise the alarm, 
within five minutes--I feel sure--of his passing within the door.&nbsp; There 
is no question of any distraction of their attention; they were all looking 
at him, from the very moment of his leaving them, and watching for his 
return.&nbsp; It was like a Vanishing Lady trick on the stage."</P>

<P>"There is certainly very little to take hold of in the case.&nbsp; There are 
of course millions of other facts quite as unimportant as those you have told 
me, and any of these might supply the missing key.&nbsp; But, on the facts as 
you state them, the main line of our solution is quite obvious.&nbsp; Tell me 
some more though."</P>

<P>"We went through the old man's affairs very carefully.&nbsp; There was no 
change in the routine of his business, had not been for years.&nbsp; He had 
very few visitors, and these were casual gossips.&nbsp; Mary was a plain 
flat-chested colourless woman, and had never had an affair of any kind or an 
offer of marriage, though she was a good match, for the district.&nbsp; There 
had been no quarrel in the family, barring the usual petty jarrings and 
scoldings from which I suppose no family is free.&nbsp; After the event they 
settled down into a new routine, undistrubed at least up to last week when I 
put through an inquiry.&nbsp; You see, there's no incident to take hold of, 
no motive..."</P>

<P>"Ah, but that is just where you fall down, my fairy skater! Cities afford 
us few of these inexplicable crimes, so called.&nbsp; In cities, people are 
always in touch with the external world, with 'reality'.&nbsp; They need 
money, or they desire something connected with others, and by finding out 
their circumstances we find out them.&nbsp; But in the country where 'nothing 
ever happens' the individual is thrown back upon himself.&nbsp; He learns to 
live in the 'imaginary' world created by his own 'psyche'.&nbsp; He discovers 
(in and through symbolic form) the realm of the 'unconscious', as Professor 
Jung calls it, and his actions are determined by fantastic motives based on 
hereditary peculiarities, or in the accidents--so-called--of his physical and 
psychical constitution.&nbsp; Thus--I am perfectly serious--a man might murder 
a perfectly inoffensive stranger because of something that happened, quite 
unknown to him, two thousand years ago.&nbsp; This world of the unconscious 
is so vast, so unexplored, that its laws are hardly guessed.&nbsp; The little 
that we have discovered is in great part not yet accepted.&nbsp; In fact, we 
who accept it at all are still quarrelling about many fundamental principles, 
and attract the scorn of the pedant.&nbsp; However, we are proving our 
case--such as it is--in the good old way of science, by our ability to predict 
the future.&nbsp; Our present purpose, though, seems to be to explain the 
past, which is nearly as useful, and I am sure that a dark tailor-made suit 
will be less conspicuous than that adorable cream frock--in Massachusetts."</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison was used by this time to unexpected terminations to the 
psychoanalyst's little sermons; so she rose quietly, and, remarking that she 
would be back in an hour with her travelling bag, waved an airy farewell.</P>

<P>"Good," nodded the mystic, "and tell Dobson to be round with the Napier."</P>

<P><CENTER>II</CENTER></P>

<P>Dobson was an English peasant from Simon Iff's place in Yorkshire.&nbsp; 
He possessed all the impenetrable stupidity of the type, with its equally 
empenetrable subtlety.&nbsp; He was one of those people who after a course of 
being swindled for several months by a particularly smart and unscrupulous 
Jew, would leave his oppressor wondering at exactly what stage of the 
transaction he had lost all his money! Before the age of the motor, he had 
been a groom dealing a little in horses as a side line; and what he had once 
done to some inhabitants of Aberdeen is not a safe topic in the city.&nbsp; 
In particular, he had the art of drawing people out by the simple process of 
pretending to fail to understand them.&nbsp; They felt they had to prove it 
to him.&nbsp; In about an hour's conversation, he would extract the story of 
his life from the most taciturn of mortals, and leave his victim with the 
impression that he had told nothing, and been neither comprehended nor 
believed.&nbsp; Simon Iff often used him to pump people with whom he himself 
could not be seen talking without arousing comment.&nbsp; He was also useful 
to his master when it was necessary to do something that looked like an 
accident.&nbsp; On this particular adventure, it was his clumsiness with the 
car that was to blame for the breakdown at Potter's Place, and the 
determination of Iff, as a surly old grouch, calling himself Dr. Hodgson, to 
spend the night at the Inn.&nbsp; Miss Mollie Madison was well remembered by 
the local yokels, but that couldn't be helped; for Simon needed her as a link 
between topographical and historical knowledge.&nbsp; She asked with just the 
desired degree of disinterested interest if any more had been heard of A. B. 
Smith.</P>

<P>Nothing could have been more unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The disappearance had 
left no more effect of any kind than a natural death could have done.&nbsp; 
Mary and her mother had indeed left the house on the hill, and gone to live 
with William on his farm; also, there was a rumour that the new minister was 
'getting acquainted' with Mary, and he being an impetuous youth from Chicago, 
it was thought that a marriage might result in six or seven years.&nbsp; 
William himself was to marry the innkeeper's daughter in the fall.</P>

<P>Mary's age being mentioned, Simon Iff ventured to remark that it was 
strange that she had not been married earlier.&nbsp; It appeared that she had 
"never been of any account."&nbsp; She was quite a regular girl in every way, 
only without personality.&nbsp; She had the "old maid's" temperament, even as 
a child.&nbsp; She had never given any trouble, or taken active part in any 
other person's affairs.&nbsp; She was considered a comfort to her parents, 
obedient, careful, and agreeable.&nbsp; She had been a capital scholar, and 
was clever at reciting Longfellow and Whittier.&nbsp; Her prudence was the 
most notable thing about her; and though without love affairs of her own, the 
young men and maidens sometimes came for advice in their own perplexities.&nbsp; 
But the disappearance of her father might be called the first thing that had 
ever really happened to her.</P>

<P>William was her equivalent in terms of masculinity; but he was more 
popular than his sister.&nbsp; He had been a good deal in Boston; he was a 
'mixer', in a mild way.&nbsp; He had the name of swallowing more whiskey and 
showing less of its effects than any man in Potter's Place.&nbsp; He had been 
soused properly, once, long ago, a debauch which ended in a fight; and his 
shame had taught him to manage his liquor.</P>

<P>So much that the innkeeper was able to contribute to the problem before 
Miss Mollie Madison retired to her room.&nbsp; Simon Iff went to smoke his 
pipe along the street, and was joined at the corner by Dobson.&nbsp; The 
latter had picked out a youth with a wicked eye, and struck what he considered 
a rich oilfield.&nbsp; His few boastful words about the naughtiness of New 
York had led the native to disclose that Potter's Place was the true Modern 
Babylon.&nbsp; Dobson didn't believe him.&nbsp; The youth went into details 
about sundry periodical excursions to Boston; and--oh, indeed, he could prove 
it--he had no less a partner in infamy than the respected William Smith.&nbsp; 
He wouldn't have told any inhabitant of Potter's Place, but this New Yorker 
had to be shewn.&nbsp; Oh no! William Smith wasn't wasting his money; any 
fool could be wicked in Boston with a fat wad; but he and William were the 
Original Mephisto Troupe; the girls fell for them, sure thing, mister.</P>

<P>Simon Iff appeared more than gratified by this discourse, and he gave 
Dobson his heartiest good-night.&nbsp; But it was a sad and sleepless night 
for himself.&nbsp; He knew it would be useless to go to bed; so he determined 
to walk to the house on the hill, now untenanted and fallen into disrepair.&nbsp; 
He explored the ruin with the aid of an electric torch.&nbsp; Everything 
confirmed the tale as he had heard it.&nbsp; He walked slowly back, smoking 
pipe after pipe; and even when he threw himself without undressing upon the 
bed, he continued that sedative occupation.</P>

<P>At breakfast he was silent, save to propose a walk to Miss Mollie 
Madison.&nbsp; She knew his mood better than to do more than nod.&nbsp; When 
they got clear of the village, he threw off his gloom with a wide gesture, as 
if it had been an actual cloak, and said:&nbsp; "Mollie, my dear, I am going 
to have a very dull day.&nbsp; I almost envy you your exciting task of 
kidnapping the parson."</P>

<P>"What on earth do you mean?"</P>

<P>"Yours, my poor child, is a long and sad story.&nbsp; Bereft of both 
parents at an early age, you became the ward of a wicked uncle, my detested 
self, and all your millions come to me if you remain unmarried at the age of 
25.&nbsp; For your parents, unhappy orphan, were conscientious Eugenists, and 
deplored Race Suicide.&nbsp; Your uncle has therefore cruelly kept you from 
the sight of men, and, in despair, you are about to marry Dobson if you can 
find a minister.&nbsp; Will this impetuous young parson from Chicago do the 
trick? It occurs to me, dear child, that he may be reluctant.&nbsp; He is a 
climber, or he would hardly be after plain Mary Smith.&nbsp; It may occur to 
him that millions instead of thousands, and beauty instead of plainness, and 
social elegance instead of bumpkin crudeness, may lie within a bold man's 
grasp.&nbsp; At this point you sigh, and say, aside, you only wish it were 
not Dobson.</P>

<P>"Child, he will fall for it; for he too is a simple soul, or he would never 
have got to such a Place as Potter's.</P>

<P>"Pillowed upon his manly breast, you proceed to point out the 
difficulties.&nbsp; You will prompt him to explain to Dobson that there is 
some hitch about the law in this particular state, so that the only way to do 
it is to steal the car, and make a regular elopement of it.&nbsp; Suggest 
Scots Law in Canada, possibly.&nbsp; Off you go, then, anywhere, anywhere out 
of Potter's Place.&nbsp; Dobson will find a way to put the Lord's humble 
servant out of the way of telegraph offices and such for one week, which is 
the extent of my little bet with myself, and you rejoin me this evening at 
the Copley Plaza.&nbsp; Register as Miss Carmichael.&nbsp; <I>Selah</I>."</P>

<P>"The programme pleases.&nbsp; But what do I get?"</P>

<P>"The right to open the letter which I have mailed this morning to your New 
York address, seven days from now, at high noon, by the pale light of the full 
moon, aha!"</P>

<P>"I suppose you have found out about A. B. Smith, then?"</P>

<P>"Well, not altogether.&nbsp; The case is old; I have only one hope of 
explaining the past; this is a little prediction about the future."</P>

<P>"What is it?"</P>

<P>"Innocent, innocent child!"</P>

<P>She could have bitten her tongue off for the indiscretion.</P>

<P>"I shall fall asleep shortly," he went on; "that will be your chance to 
escape."</P>

<P>She nodded, all on fire with the idea of her inexplicable adventure.&nbsp; 
Half-an-hour later, in the parlour of the hotel, Simon Iff's pipe fell from 
his lips to the floor.&nbsp; She picked it up.&nbsp; He did not stir.&nbsp; 
"Hush!" said she to the innkeeper, who could see into the room from his place 
at the bar, "don't disturb him.&nbsp; If he wants me, I've gone for a little 
walk."</P>

<P>With much obvious stealth, calculated to the diplomatic atmosphere of 
Potter's Place, she found Dobson in the garage.&nbsp; Prey to a thousand 
fears, registered with all the exaggeration of a moving picture, they got out 
the car, and drove out to the parson's house.</P>

<P>Miss Mollie Madison had a very easy job of it.&nbsp; Her dazzling beauty 
with its frank yet delicate voluptuousness, her jewels, her distinction, would 
have turned the head of any man.&nbsp; She was not a girl to play any game 
half-heartedly; she swept him clear off his feet, told him that she loved him 
at first sight, proved it with a kiss and a hug that could hardly have been 
matched in Buda-Pesth, and had him safely in the car within half-an-hour.&nbsp; 
Dobson made fifty-eight miles an hour through the main street of Potter's 
Place, the awakened 'uncle' standing in front of the hotel, and swearing like 
a Mississippi pilot.&nbsp; He got no sympathy from the romantic villagers.&nbsp; 
He rushed to the telegraph office, and dispatched frantic messages to the 
police of all the towns in the neighbourhood, except those on Dobson's 
route.&nbsp; Ultimately, after a very fine imitation of an apoplectic fit, he 
boarded the train for Boston, and screamed his wrongs aloud to everybody in 
the car.</P>

<P>At the Copley Plaza he was Simon Iff again, and slept till he was informed 
on the telephone that a Miss Carmichael wished to see him.</P>

<P>It was dinner-time; the evening papers devoted comic columns to the 
escapade.&nbsp; But Simon Iff was in his most serious mood.&nbsp; He talked of 
Life and Death, of Responsibility and of Justice.&nbsp; His theme was mainly 
that all actions bear in themselves their retribution for good or ill, but 
only in seed, so to speak.&nbsp; It was circumstance that made that seed 
increase, and bring forth fruit.&nbsp; Consequently, it was no crime to bring 
about the flowering of such seed.&nbsp; He recalled to her the case of the 
Marsden Murders, how he had put into the mind of the guilty lawyer the thought 
that would drive him mad with fear, the case of Phineas Burns, and that of 
Aminadab Spratt.</P>

<P>"Should I reproach myself?" he ended.&nbsp; "Where the law cannot reach a 
criminal, I have no right to take that law into my own hands.&nbsp; But have 
I not the right to let loose the latent Justice in that criminal's own 
soul?"</P>

<P>Mollie agreed easily, not comprehending any importance in his speech.</P>

<P>He suddenly flared out at her with two sharp words, and a flung-forth 
finger.</P>

<P>"Remember that!"</P>

<P>But she did not remember it.&nbsp; He came down the next morning to find 
her at the breakfast-table, a newspaper open before her, her face white and 
drawn, her big eyes dreadful with black rims, and the tears dried at their 
source with the excess of her affliction.</P>

<P>"Blame me!" he said, and shook her by the shoulder roughly, so that she 
winced.&nbsp; A dry sob answered him.</P>

<P>He did not need to look at the newspaper.&nbsp; "That," said he, "was the 
purport of the letter I mailed yesterday."&nbsp; Her wonder momentarily 
overcame her anguish.</P>

<P>"How did you know?" she cried, and covered her face.&nbsp; "No! no! I 
don't want to know; but why, why, why did you make me do it?"</P>

<P>He sat down at her side.&nbsp; "There are people about.&nbsp; Command 
yourself.&nbsp; Oh, but I am a fool.&nbsp; I should have known you would 
never understand the connexion."</P>

<P>"The connexion?"</P>

<P>"Pull yourself together! Can't you see that this is merely the sequel to 
the A. B. Smith mystery?"</P>

<P>"I can only see that I have played a mad jest, and brought a woman to her 
death."</P>

<P>"There's hope yet.&nbsp; I've been thinking it out, and I'm morally sure 
she hasn't burnt it."</P>

<P>"Burnt it? Burnt what?"</P>

<P>"The story of the Mysterious Disappearance of A. B. Smith.&nbsp; Come now; 
I'll get the coroner on long-distance, and tell him to look for it.&nbsp; 
What does her note to him say, by the way?"</P>

<P>He picked up the paper.</P>

<P>"Ah, here it is.&nbsp; 'Sir, I beg you to pardon a most unhappy woman for 
the trouble to which she is about to put you.&nbsp; Respectfully, Mamie 
Smith.'&nbsp; Oh, this is more to the point.&nbsp; To her brother.&nbsp; 
'Dearest William, in my will I have left to you all my share in the 
property.&nbsp; But I ask you to get the best publisher you can find in 
Boston to bring out my poems, in the manuscript volume in the cupboard over 
my bed.&nbsp; The keys are round my neck.&nbsp; Forgive me for this act, but 
I could not bear life any more.&nbsp; Kiss mother for me.&nbsp; Your loving 
but broken-hearted sister, Mame.'&nbsp; Hum! nothing about any diary--oho! 
methinks I smell powder.&nbsp; We must read those poems, you and I, Mollie.&nbsp; 
I have an idea.&nbsp; I will ask friend Mullins, who is most certainly all 
that is desirable in a publisher of <I>belles lettres</I>, to let me run up 
to Potter's Place on his behalf.&nbsp; Come, let us telephone; no matter for 
breakfast; we will catch the morning train."</P>

<P><CENTER>III</CENTER></P>

<P>"I am bringing you into the next act," said Simon, "contrary to tact, to 
prudence, to good sense.&nbsp; There will be all kinds of a row when you 
appear, especially without our friendly parson, who, by the way, Dobson 
informs me, is quite reconciled to his sad fate.&nbsp; He has a nice little 
wad to console him, and, anyhow, he can hardly return to his flock, can he? 
Abduction is his Scylla, and laughter his Charybdis, if he goes back.&nbsp; 
So we eliminate him.&nbsp; But then why bring you up there? Why print a 
duodecimo edition of Hell, with plates, half morocco, when it isn't in the 
lease necessary? Because, o blue-eyed babe, I want all those naturally silent 
parties to go up in the air about it.&nbsp; I want excitement, and gossip, 
and the rest of it.&nbsp; We are still far from the solution of the problem 
of A. B. Smith.&nbsp; At least, we've got to prove our case to the hilt; 
otherwise, we're in a rather critical postion.&nbsp; We've done--apparently--a 
lot of moral, and possibly a little bit of legal, wrong.&nbsp; We must do a 
good deal more than put up the argument which the enemies of the Jesuits 
falsely attribute to them; that the end justifies the means.&nbsp; Well, 
here's Potter's Place; for I perceive the noble Dobson at the wheel, amidst 
a crowd who are not quite sure whether to lynch him.&nbsp; How perfectly 
jolly!"</P>

<P>Dobson himself was as indifferent to the gesticulating people as if he had 
been blind and deaf.&nbsp; His aplomb, aided by that of the magician and the 
maiden, was triumphant.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; A pleasant time was had 
by all.</P>

<P>Twenty minutes later the Napier drew up at the door of the farm of William 
Smith.&nbsp; Simon Iff rapidly explained his business, in the most formal 
terms.</P>

<P>The coroner was with Smith, who had spent the hour or so previous in 
abusing Mollie, whom he perceived dimly as the cause of the catastrophe.&nbsp; 
At the sight of her he broke out into a string of curses.&nbsp; Iff stopped 
him with a commanding gesture.&nbsp; "Curse me, if you will," said he; "this 
lady acted at my request."</P>

<P>Smith was not a person of marked perspecuity; but he saw, even in his 
anger, that he had come suddenly upon an unintelligible motive; and his wrath 
fell instantly.&nbsp; "What's the big idea?" he said, almost with 
indifference.</P>

<P>"Mr. Smith," said Simon, "I am come to clear up the mystery of your 
father's disappearance."&nbsp; Something in his manner prevented the obvious 
retort of incredulity.&nbsp; This strange man, who had come so violently into 
his placid life, not only might, but must know something.&nbsp; Else, why 
should he have come? The pretext of publishing dropped out of sight without 
causing surprise or suspicion.</P>

<P>The magician was pleased; the reaction was better than he had expected.</P>

<P>"Come then," he continued, "let us get this famous manuscript.&nbsp; I will 
most particularly ask Dr. Upton here to take note of what I shall have to say 
during the reading."</P>

<P>The coroner nodded.&nbsp; "Pleased, I'm sure."&nbsp; They went into the 
dead woman's bedroom.&nbsp; The body still lay where life had left it.&nbsp; 
"She knew her anatomy," said the doctor; "a wound with a pair of common 
scissors, but as straight to the heart as the Mayos could have done.&nbsp; 
Never saw a neater job."</P>

<P>He took three keys from the dead throat.&nbsp; The cupboard, (in that 
distant simple place!) had a Yale lock.&nbsp; Within was a safe.&nbsp; Within 
the safe they found a second iron box, and again the key was of elaborate and 
expensive make.&nbsp; Everybody began to understand that such precautions 
must have been taken to guard something held of incalculable value.</P>

<P>But the second box, lined with cedar wood, contained only a heavy sheet of 
rose-coloured silk, which was wrapped about a small book of the kind that very 
fashionable stationers sell to rich women for memoranda.&nbsp; The binding was 
of deep blue polished morocco, the paper hand-made.</P>

<P>Simon Iff took the volume in his hands with a certain reverence.</P>

<P>"Before I open this," he said, "I will prove my right to be here.&nbsp; 
We know that this book contains poems, and that Miss Smith valued them most 
highly.&nbsp; We know no more; but I will say more, for the satisfaction of 
Mr. Smith."&nbsp; He turned to the brother.&nbsp; "Your sister was careless 
and clumsy with the pen?"</P>

<P>"Yes, sir, she never liked the trouble of writing."</P>

<P>"These poems will be found to be in the most careful and delicate 
caligraphy.&nbsp; She was a prosaic, matter-of-fact woman, very patient and 
humble, inclined to avoid notice?"</P>

<P>"Quite right, mister."</P>

<P>"These poems will be found high-flown, passionate, romantic, and above all 
proud.&nbsp; Now then to the proof."</P>

<P>He opened the book.&nbsp; The first page was his vindication.&nbsp; It was 
written with a crow quill, ornamented with flourishes which wandered, like 
strange vines, over the page, in such a fashion that the contour of the 
design was as it were a symbolic representation of the title itself.&nbsp; 
Simon read it out.</P>

<P>"'The Book of the Heart's Blood of the Lily of God.'&nbsp; Do you 
understand?" he asked.</P>

<P>"I was never one for this highbrow stuff."</P>

<P>"Well," said Iff, "it means that she regarded herself as a being divinely 
pure, perhaps even uniquely pure, and that she had pressed out her sorrow, 
like rich wine, into this book.&nbsp; Let us go on."</P>

<P>The second page bore the author's name, and a date:&nbsp; May, 1891.&nbsp; 
Beneath this, in brackets, 'My first poem'.&nbsp; Then the title 'The Angel of 
the Sun.'&nbsp; Simon proceeded to read it.</P>

<P>"Now what is the meaning of this poem? Why does a girl of twelve or 
thirteen occupy herself with such ideas? She uses the first person, yet who is 
speaking? The most glorious being possible to imagine, so glorious that the 
photosphere of the Sun himself is a thick mask upon his face.&nbsp; Yet this 
being is afraid! He fears that mortals might see or hear him, and die of 
terror.</P>

<P>"Now what does this really mean? Here is a child of unusual plainness, 
rather despised, feeling herself already an inferior person..."</P>

<P>"Why yes, she was never of any account."</P>

<P>"So, being sensitive, she created a psychic compensation.&nbsp; She 
deliberately retired from reality, and identified herself with what is really 
little less than God.&nbsp; Probably she would have made it God but that the 
idea of Him was bound up too closely with the minds of the people whom she 
hated, and so had become repellent.&nbsp; It was God, too, who had made her 
weak, plain, feminine; so she had to invent a 'Saviour' of her own.&nbsp; She 
had to be very careful, too, not to let out this secret life of hers; so she 
invents a reason for her own shyness and reticence and fear of others.&nbsp; 
If those who tortured her guessed for one second Who She Really Was, they 
would fall dead with terror.&nbsp; Thus her social weakness is pictured as the 
virtue--she was taught to consider it as such--of compassion.&nbsp; Let us 
turn over."</P>

<P>The next poem was entitled 'Knut Olaf' with a date two years later.&nbsp; 
It was in ballad form, quatrains, and began by describing the power of this 
great Norseman, how he slew the Dragon of the Sea, and made war on giants and 
kings.&nbsp; At last he comes to America; the Red Man resists him in vain.&nbsp; 
But he meets his Waterloo in the end.&nbsp; "Now, listen to this particularly," 
said Simon, who had been reading out only a few lines here and there to give 
the general idea.</P>

<P>The third poem in the book was entitled 'A Dream.'&nbsp; It began, 
shamelessly enough:</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"Here, where the forest primeval once
sheltered the tent<BR>

People pure in the heart, like the moon, some dreams.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I dreamt one,<BR>
And I cannot imagine at all why it seemed so exceedingly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vivid.<BR>
It was in the fall of the year, and the trees<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were losing their verdure.<BR>
I went through the woods, and the leaves on the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground were all of them corpses.<BR>
Then I came to the town where my father was<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selling a diamond,<BR>
But nobody wanted to buy it; but then came a<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squab, and he took it<BR>
Away in his beak to the woods, and buried it<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the corpses<BR>
And sat on it all through the winter, and then,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I wanted to know most<BR>
Of all what would happen, I woke, and I found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the pillow was moistened<BR>
With tears.&nbsp; Ah, what did it mean? It was really<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceedingly
vivid."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>"I want only to call attention to the fact that in the first scene she is 
the one live being in a world of corpses; in the next, her father is trying 
to sell a diamond, a clean and precious jewel, unvalued except by a squab (or 
dove; connected in her mind, of course, with the Holy Ghost).&nbsp; She 
herself has really disappeared in this scene; in truth, she has become the 
diamond.&nbsp; And though she is sure that some glorious fortune is in store 
for her, the feeling of doubt enters, and prevents a triumphant conclusion to 
the dream, which therefore makes her cry.</P>

<P>"In a dream or a phantasy water usually means maternity.&nbsp; That idea is 
to her the climax of horror.&nbsp; Birth is the device by which nature 
perpetuates suffering--for to her the world now appears wholly evil.&nbsp; Of 
course, she did not know what she was writing.&nbsp; She thought of it only as 
a 'poem'.&nbsp; But to us who have the key the reference to Moses is highly 
significant.&nbsp; The blood is the safeguard.&nbsp; Yet there is still danger 
from which the subconscious mind shrinks.&nbsp; Nothing can really alleviate 
its anxiety but the cessation of the water altogether, its transformation into 
a glassy steel, which shall repel the assault even of the sun, the greatest of 
creative forces.&nbsp; It is a symbolic confirmation of the cipher, at least 
of part of it.&nbsp; Here's another lyric, same month:&nbsp; 'The Sun'.</P>

<P>"Same story; the father had robbed her; she hates his energy, his 
superiority, his power; and she delights to think that he will die.&nbsp; 
And what is it that will overcome him? Empty space, cold, formless, 
infinite.&nbsp; She is no longer merely the angel of the sun, who wishes only 
to avoid striking men dead.&nbsp; She is space itself.&nbsp; She will strike 
the sun himself dead, and she rejoices in it.</P>

<P>"This change is brought about by her experience of the world.&nbsp; As a 
child she was still hopeful of acquiring superiority in the world of 
reality.&nbsp; Now she knows that it is hopeless.&nbsp; Her vanity-phantasy 
is not strong enough to compensate; she hates her torturers, and begins to 
concentrate that hatred upon her father, who robbed her, by one of those 
mysterious sex-magic tricks, of her right to be a boy."</P>

<P>"But this is rubbish," broke in Smith.&nbsp; "Mamie was very fond of her 
father.&nbsp; And she didn't want to be a boy; she was always boasting of her 
womanhood."</P>

<P>"I said so.&nbsp; Men were all evil to her.&nbsp; Yet she did want to be a 
boy before she invented these phantasies.&nbsp; Think now.&nbsp; Go back to 
your earliest memories."</P>

<P>"That's so, by Gosh.&nbsp; I remember it all now.&nbsp; And then one day 
she shut up like a clam, and got furious when I teased her."</P>

<P>"And she only developed the hate of her father when she was old enough to 
have all this subconscious stuff thoroughly suppressed.&nbsp; She would have 
been horrified if you had told her what those poems meant.&nbsp; And yet the 
cipher is plain enough.&nbsp; It was dictated by the neurotic's need of 
confession, and put in cipher by his parallel need of secrecy.&nbsp; Cheer up! 
I know it sounds mysterious and contradictory, and not a little unlike humbug; 
but I've a hunch that we'll come out to a Fact with a capital F before we're 
through this book.&nbsp; Come along; let's skip a little--suppose we find 
something about nineteen five or six.&nbsp; What's this? The title-poem! 'The 
Lily of God.'</P>

<P>"Verse Two!" announced Simon Iff, with a savage look at Miss Mollie Madison,

<P>"There's a lot more, but we have enough here.&nbsp; It's the same thought, 
in a jargon of misunderstood Theosophy, and a great show of sham learning 
introduced to give her the sensation of superiority of knowledge or 
scholarship:&nbsp; more psychic compensation.&nbsp; But the main idea is this 
vast formless negative icy sphere--she's compelled to the formula she hates, 
poor girl!--which swallows up the fire and energy of the father, not by 
construction but by annihilation.&nbsp; Observe, she is no longer content to 
have his skull split; she wants him to disappear without leaving the minutest 
trace.&nbsp; Oh we're getting near nineteen seven, be sure!"</P>

<P>William Smith had become strangely excited.&nbsp; He trembled continusouly, 
and the sweat ran over his face.</P>

<P>Simon Iff turned the pages.&nbsp; The poems were more confident and positive 
as he proceeded.&nbsp; There was one that ended:</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"The Curse, the Everlasting<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curse,<BR>
Swept beyond the
Universe."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>Another was on sympathetic magic, as if she had been reading <I>"The Golden 
Bough"</I>.&nbsp; One verse read:</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"Every boy that fills a cup<BR>
Winds eternal mischief up,<BR>
And every girl that breaks a rod<BR>
Throws his malice back to
God."</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>"Something of Black in that, somehow, eh? Never mind; it shows she was 
thinking of doing a magic ceremony.&nbsp; Just as you can raise a wind by 
blowing in some ceremonial fashion, so you could blot out the infinite evil 
if you could blot out some person whom you took to symbolize the cause of 
evil.&nbsp In this case, the father.&nbsp; Now--come to the critical 
year--hullo! This s great.&nbsp; Words no longer seem adequate to the  
conception.&nbsp; So we find a symbolic picture."</P>

<P>It was a very simple drawing, entirely crude and untutored, but with a 
curious fascination of evil such as one often sees in 'automatic' or 'spirit' 
pictures.&nbsp; The whole page was covered with stars, and the Milky Way ran 
through it like a snake.&nbsp; Part of this group was thickened into the 
likeness of a shark, on whose head was set the crescent moon.&nbsp; With open 
jaw it was rushing upon the sun, to whom the artist had given not only 
features, but thin arms and legs.&nbsp; In one arm he was brandishing a 
stick.&nbsp; The picture was full of movement; a most skillful artist might 
have been less successful in this respect than this untrained woman.</P>

<P>At the bottom of the page appeared the earth, a hilly landscape with 
clouds masking the sky.&nbsp; There was a house upon a hill-side, and between 
the house and the hill a rude bridge of planks.&nbsp; Under the bridge was a 
small black circle, and in the air above it a broken stick.</P>

<P>Simon Iff did not take long to read the message.</P>

<P>"Here," said he, "we see an attempt to picture the relations between heaven 
and earth.&nbsp; The shark Nirvana, with the Chaste Moon for the crest, is 
going to swallow the Sun with his symbol of authority and paternity.&nbsp; The 
corresponding facts on earth concern this house on the hill.&nbsp; Mr. Smith, 
was there a plank gangway to the back door of the house?"</P>

<P>"Why yes, Mr. Iff.&nbsp; There was a shallow cave in the shale where things 
were kept for coolness.&nbsp; The planks saved one from walking over the 
rough shale, which was pretty wet, too, most times, from a spring somewhere."</P>

<P>"Then if you will get into my car, I will take you to the grave of your 
father."</P>

<P>Smith, like a man in a trance, followed, with Miss Mollie Madison and the 
coroner to bring up the rear.&nbsp; He had a new shock of terror when Dobson 
produced pick and shovel from beneath his seat.&nbsp; He perceived that all 
had been understood and foreseen.</P>

<P>The planks of the gangway were already rotted.&nbsp; They broke at once 
under Dobson's vigorous blows.</P>

<P>"Dig a six-inch channel," said the magician, "it won't be very deep."</P>

<P>He was right.&nbsp; The loose shale flew high as Dobson shovelled.&nbsp; 
Less than a foot beneath the surface he struck a hard smooth surface.&nbsp; 
It was cement.&nbsp; A few strokes disclosed a circular plate of this 
material.&nbsp; The chauffeur took the pick, and broke it.&nbsp; He stopped, 
and flung the loose pieces to one side.&nbsp; A broken stick, all rotten, lay 
upon the skeleton of a man.</P>

<P>It dawned suddenly upon William Smith that this whole operation had been 
designed to trap him.&nbsp; He trembled.&nbsp; He read something akin to his 
own apprehension in the eye of the coroner, who was regarding him askance.</P>

<P>"I swear by God," he cried solemnly, "that I had not art nor part in 
this."</P>

<P>"My dear man," returned Simon, "I never supposed for one moment that you 
had.&nbsp; Your alibi is perfect."</P>

<P>"Alibi!" stammered Smith, more alarmed than ever.&nbsp; "I don't know what 
you mean.&nbsp; I was here."</P>

<P>"A moral alibi, friend Smith! Your mind was not on sharks and suns; you 
were cantering away to Boston, having a glorious time with the girls.&nbsp; 
You had conquered reality; you did not need any psychic compensation for a 
sense of inferiority."&nbsp; He extended his hand; Smith took it, with tears 
in his eyes.</P>

<P>"Understand, please," said the magician, "that I knew this whole story, all 
but the location of the body, before I had been three hours in Potter's 
Place.</P>

<P>"It was certain that your father had met with foul play; his psychology 
was all against a voluntary disappearance.&nbsp; And how could he have avoided 
the family? And why should he not have disappeared in some simple way, by 
going off to Boston, and crossing the Atlantic, for instance? Besides, he had 
touched no money for such a journey.&nbsp; It was then clear that one of the 
family was responsible; perhaps two, or even all three.&nbsp; But the active 
agent must have been Mamie; it was she who followed her father into the house, 
and was alone with him for five minutes or so.&nbsp; She could easily arrange 
the details:&nbsp; a place of concealment for the body, possibly a temporary 
affair like her trunk.&nbsp; Anything would serve, since no one would think 
to look for a hidden corpse, but only for a living man.&nbsp; She had then 
merely to hide his stick, so as to detain him in the house, and give her an 
excuse to go back and do the murder.&nbsp; More likely still, she may have 
hidden the stick as a symbolic gesture--and simply seen and taken the 
opportunity--despite her conscious will--when it presented itself.&nbsp; Some 
casual word of the old man may have fired the hidden train of gunpowder.</P>

<P>"But why should she take so extraordinary a means to cope with her secret 
anguish? One could only see an answer by invoking the Psychology of the 
Unconscious.&nbsp; I began to probe the persons concerned.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith 
was clearly guiltless.&nbsp; She had not the physical strength or adroitness; 
besides, she was not there.&nbsp; Unless all three were lying, Mamie was 
alone with her father.&nbsp; Andall three were not lying, if they had been, 
they would have invented some commonplace story of accident.</P>

<P>"So we contemplate Mamie, the plain, flat-chested unconsidered nullity, not 
wanted save for household drudgery.&nbsp; It was she, surely, who, if she 
became neurotic, as she was almost certain to do, might accentuate her 
compensating fiction to the point of attacking the social condition which 
oppressed her in the person of its representative, the 'Father-Governor'.&nbsp; 
He, too, was personally responsible for most of her misery, since he had 
begotten her female and not male, or (as she put it in that cipher) had robbed 
her of manhood.&nbsp; Also, he was--in the eyes of her Unconscious self--'the 
Man', that is, she was as an infant unconsciously in love with him.&nbsp; The 
incest-barrier (as we call it) baulked her here; and as, when she came to the 
experience of sex-need, she was not able to obtain other men to represent the 
Father, she threw back on him the responsibility for her emptiness.</P>

<P>"Now then, was William Smith her accomplice? At first sight--or rather 
hearing, for I got all this, so far, in New York from this lady's account--it 
seemed probable, for material, if not psychological, reasons.&nbsp; But when I 
discovered that he was expressing himself freely and fully as the 'superior 
male', capable, ambitious, enjoying himself without restraint in Boston, I 
absolved him.&nbsp; Morals are the cause of madness.&nbsp; Unmoral people 
never go mad, except in the case where insanity is a symptom of some disease 
like tuberculosis.&nbsp; Madness is caused by a conflict in the will.&nbsp; 
Immoral, as opposed to unmoral, people often go mad; for their 'conscience' 
reproaches them--Satan divided against Satan.&nbsp; And moral people go mad 
too, for their suppressed desires reproach them; and this is worse than 
conscience, because conscience is a factitious thing, an Intruder on Nature.&nbsp; 
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&nbsp; The penalty of 
disobedience is insanity.</P>

<P>"So this book of poems, which the writer herself never properly understood, 
fully and wholly, leads us to this grave.&nbsp; Here is the stick, the symbol 
of authority, broken by the blow which shattered the skull of its living 
parallel, the Father.&nbsp; Now we are ready to continue our reading.</P>

<P>"The next few poems are short and joyous.&nbsp; The magic has succeeded.&nbsp; 
But look here! Nineteen nine, April.&nbsp; Isn't this strange? 'The Pipes of 
Pan'.&nbsp; Last verse.</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>"'O Syrinx, we were glad

<P>"Still no sense of humour! But are not these strange words from the Chosen 
Virgin? No; for her father's murder has been successful.&nbsp; She feels that 
she has conquered reality; so she faces it at last.&nbsp; The murder is only a 
substituted satisfaction of her real need; but it has given her confidence.&nbsp; 
The idea comes into her mind:&nbsp; 'I may be able to fulfill myself sexually 
after all.'&nbsp; Now watch is idea grow.&nbsp; Here are poems passionate, 
even sensual, one after another.&nbsp; 'The Night is Short,' 'My Dove,' 
'Abelard', and so on.&nbsp; She still wants to triumph over man, but now it is 
in the normal way.&nbsp; All this means that she sees a chance to marry.&nbsp; 
But with this comes the note of doubt, of lack of confidence in herself.&nbsp; 
In the world of her psychic compensation she had conquered completely; but in 
this real life she was still unproven.&nbsp; We are near the end now--ah 
look!"</P>

<P>The poems had all been fair copies in her superbly delicate caligraphy; but 
this last page was a hurried scrawl, with blots.&nbsp; It was as if she wished 
to symbolize, even by means of external form, the sudden ruin of her life.&nbsp; 
The poem was entitled 'Red'.</P>

But when I came to thy my triumph out,<BR>
Again I found the accursed red supreme.<BR>
O vile! O serpent! I had crushed thee firm<BR>
When I destroyed, annihilated Man,<BR>
But thou, disguised, o execrable worm,<BR>
Hast by a prostitute upset my plan.<BR>
Thou art the Sun, thou God and Father, thou<BR>
Red-Headed Harlot, scarlet Babylon<BR>
That took my triumph.&nbsp; O, I see thee now<BR>
And him thy red mouth, harlot, fixes on.<BR>
I see thee pass me in a flash of light,<BR>
The chariot of the Sun.&nbsp; Then what's to do?<BR>
I will die virgin, for my soul is white,<BR>
Spilling the red in me, my fault all
through!'"</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>Simon Iff hesitated a moment, as if puzzled.</P>

<P>"Excuse me, Sir," said Dobson, "but I can explain one bit of that.&nbsp; 
She was in the village as we raced through.&nbsp; Miss Madison didn't see her 
because (begging your pardon, Miss) she was all over the parson, kissing him, 
with her hair down."</P>

<P>"I have never been accused of lack of thoroughness," cried Mollie, her 
shame taking refuge in pert affrontery.</P>

<P>"I think it's all clear now," said Simon Iff, very sadly.&nbsp; "At the 
last moment Reality defeats her by that very symbol of Red which she thought 
she had destroyed.&nbsp; Then the true horror was revealed to her as by an 
angel; the Red was in herself all the time.&nbsp; the 'Virgin' compensation 
was a fraud, after all; the red blood was in her heart.&nbsp; Ah well, that 
could easily be cured."</P>

<P>He closed the book, and put it into the hands of William Smith.</P>

<P>Then he locked his hands behind his back, and went with bowed head out of 
the house.</P>

<P>They followed him.&nbsp; He ignored the car, and went slowly towards 
Potter's Place, none daring to speak to him.</P>

<P>Smith and the coroner, walking some fifty yards behind with Miss Mollie 
Madison, saw that she was crying.&nbsp; Smith tried a stammering word of 
consolation.&nbsp; "Oh! Oh!" she said trembling, "there was never a man like 
Simon Iff.&nbsp; His soul is one fierce flame of love for humanity, and 
he--he--sees--too--much."</P>
