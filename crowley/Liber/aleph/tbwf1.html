<p>I have begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangely, as thou knowest, upon the 
Scarlet Woman called Hilarion, as it was mysteriously foretold unto me in <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of the Law</font></i>. Now therefore 
that thou art come to the Age of Understanding, do thou give ear unto my Wisdom, 
for that therein lieth a simple and direct Way for every Man that he may attain 
to the End. </p>
<p>Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual Experience and 
Perfection have no necessary connection with Advancement in our Holy Order. But 
for each Man is a Path: there is a Constant, and there is a Variable. Seek ever 
therefore in thy Work of the Promulgation of the Law to discover in each Man his 
own true Nature. </p>
<p>For in each Man his Inmost Light is the Core of his Star. That is, Hadit; and 
his Work is the Identification of himself with that Light. <br>
It is not every Man who is called to the sublime Task of the A<font face="Symbol">\</font>A<font face="Symbol">\</font>, 
wherein he must master thoroughly every Detail of the Great Work, so that he may 
in due Season accomplish it not only for himself, but for all who are bound unto 
him. There are very many for whom in their present Incarnations this Great Work 
may be impossible; since their appointed Work may be in Satisfaction of some 
Magical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or in Fulfilment of some Defect. 
As is written: <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">Suum Cuique</font></i>. </p>
<p>Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels, I yearn greatly towards thee, o 
my Son, and I strive strongly with my Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make plain 
thy Way before thee; and thus in many Chapters will I write for thee those 
things that may profit thee. <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">Sis benedictus</font></i>.

</center>
<p>Do thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the Holy Qabalah. Know 
that herein the Relations between Numbers, though they be mighty in Power and 
prodigal of Knowledge, are but lesser Things. For the Work is to reduce all 
other conceptions to these of Number, because thus thou wilt lay bare the very 
Structure of thy Mind, whose rule is Necessity rather than Prejudice. Not until 
the Universe is thus laid naked before thee canst thou truly anatomize it. The 
Tendencies of thy Mind lie deeper far than any Thought, for they are the 
Conditions and the Laws of Thought; and it is these that thou must bring to 
Nought. </p>
<p>This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies thereof most awful, most 
sublime. It is for the Great Souls to enter on this Rigour and Austerity. To 
them the Gods themselves do Homage; for it is the Way of Utmost Purity. <br>

<b>DE VITA CORRIGENDA</b></p>
</center>
<p>Know, son, that the true Principle of Self-Control is Liberty. For we are 
born into a World which is in Bondage to Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, 
even as the Enemies to the Bed of Procrustes. Each of us, as he grows, learns 
Repression of himself and his true Will. &quot;It is a lie, this folly against self&quot;: 
these Words are written in <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of the 
Law</font></i>. So therefore these Passions in ourselves which we understand to 
be Hindrances are not part of our True Will, but diseased Appetites, manifest in 
us through false early Training. Thus the Tabus of savage Tribes in such matter 
as Love constrain that True Love which is born in us; and by this Constraint 
come ills of Body and Mind. Either the Force of Repression carries it, and 
creates Neuroses and Insanities; or the Revolt against that Force, breaking 
forth with Violence, involves Excesses and Extravagances. All these Things are 
Disorders, and against Nature. Now then learn of me the testimony of History and 
literature as a great Scroll of Learning. But the Vellum of the Scroll is of 
Man's Skin, and its Ink of his Heart's Blood. <br>

</center>
<p>The Fault, that is Fatality, in Love, as in every other Form of Will, is 
Impurity. It is not the Spontaneity there-of which worketh Woe, but some 
Repression in the Environment. </p>
<p>In the Fable of Adam and Eve is this great Lesson taught by the Masters of 
the Holy Qabalah. For Love were to them the eternal Eden, save for the 
Repression signified by the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus their 
Nature of Love was perfect; it was their Fall from that Innocence which drove 
them from the Garden. </p>
<p>In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but family Feud, which imported 
nothing to that Love, was its Bane; and the Rashness and Violence of their 
Revolt against that Repression, slew them. </p>
<p>In the pure Outrush of Love in Desdemona for Othello was no Flaw; but his 
Love was marred by his consciousness of his Age and his Race, of the Prejudices 
of his Fellows and of his own Experience of Woman-frailty. <br>

</center>
<p>Now as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of Love, so also doeth 
History, and the Lesson is ever the same. <br>
Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were destroyed by the System of 
Repression in which they chanced to move. <br>
Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social Artificialities; and Paolo slain on 
account of Things external to his Love of Francesca. <br>
Then, <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">per contra</font></i>, Martin Luther, 
being a Giant of Will, and also the Eighth Henry of England, as a mighty King, 
bent them to overturn the whole World that they might have satisfaction of their 
Loves. </p>
<p>And who shall follow them? For even now we find great Churchmen, Statesmen, 
Princes, Dramamakers, and many lesser Men, overwhelmed utterly and ruined by the 
conflict between their Passions and the Society about them. Wherein which Party 
errs is no matter of Moment for our Thought; but the Existence of the War is 
Evidence of Wrong done to Nature. <br>

<p>Therefore, o my Son, be thou wary, not bowing before the false Idols and 
ideals, yet not flaming forth in Fury against them, unless that be thy Will. </p>
<p>But in this Matter be prudent and be silent, discerning subtly and with 
acumen the nature of the Will within thee; so that thou mistake not Fear for 
Chastity, or Anger for Courage. And since the fetters are old and heavy, and thy 
Limbs withered and distorted by reason of their Compulsion, do thou, having 
broken them, walk gently for a little while, until the ancient Elasticity 
return, so that thou mayst walk, run, and leap naturally and with Rejoicing. </p>
<p>Also, since these Fetters are as a Bond almost universal, be instant to 
declare the Law of Liberty, and the full Knowledge of all Truth that 
appertaineth to this Matter; for if in this only thou overcome, then shall all 
Earth be free, taking its Pleasure in Sunlight without Fear or Phrenzy. Amen.

</center>
<p>Understand, o my Son, in thy Youth, these Words which some wise One, now 
nameless, spake of old; except ye become as little Children ye shall in no wise 
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is to say that thou must first comprehend 
thine original Nature in every Point, before thou wast forced to bow before the 
Gods of Wood and Stone that Men have made, not comprehending the Law of Change, 
and of Evolution Through Variation, and the independent Value of every living 
Soul. </p>
<p>Learn this also, that even the Will to the Great Work may be misunderstood of 
Men; for this Work must proceed naturally and without Overstress, as all true 
Works. Right also is that Word that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, 
and the violent take it by Force. But except thou be violent by Virtue of thy 
true Nature, how shalt thou take it? Be not as the Ass in the Lion's Skin; but 
if thou be born Ass, bear patiently thy Burdens, and enjoy thy Thistles; for an 
Ass also, as in the Fables of Apuleius and Matthaiss, may come to Glory in the 
Path of his own Virtue. <br>

</center>
<p>Sayest thou (methinks) that here is a great Riddle, since by Reason of much 
Repression thou hast lost the Knowledge of thine original Nature? </p>
<p>My son, this is not so; for by a peculiar Ordinance of Heaven, and a 
Disposition occult within his Mine, is every Man protected from this Loss of his 
own Soul, until and unless be be by Choronzon disintegrated and dispersed beyond 
power of Will to repair; as when the Conflict within him, rending and burning, 
hath made his Mind utterly desert, and his Soul Madness. </p>
<p>Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost; though it be buried 
beneath a life-old Midden of Repressions, for it persisteth vital within thee 
(is it not the true Motion of thine inmost Being?) and for all thy conscious 
Striving cometh forth by Night and by Stealth in Dream and Phantasy. Now is it 
naked and brilliant, now clothed in rich Robes of Symbol and Hieroglyph; but 
always travelleth it with thee upon thy Path, ready to acquaint thee with thy 
true Nature, if thou attend unto its Word, its Gesture, or its Show of Imagery.

<p>Therefore deem not that thy lightest Fancy is insignificant. Thy most 
unconscious Acts are Keys to the Treasure-Chamber of thine own Palace, which is 
the House of the Holy Ghost. Consider well thy conscious Thoughts and Acts, for 
they are under the Dominion of thy Will, and moved in Accord with the Operation 
of thy Reason; this indeed is a necessary work, enabling to comprehend in what 
manner thou mayst adjust thyself to thine Environment. Yet is this Adaptation 
but Defence for the most Part, or at the best Subterfuge and Stratagem in the 
Tactics of thy Life, with but an accidental and subordinate Relation to thy true 
Will, whereof by Consciousness and by Reason thou mayst be ignorant, unless by 
Fortune great and rare thou be already harmonized in thyself, the Outer with the 
Inner, which Grace is not common among Men, and is the Reward of previous 
Attainment. </p>
<p>Neglect not simple Introspections, therefore; but give yet greater Heed unto 
those Dreams and Phantasies, those Gestures and Manners unconscious, and of 
undiscovered Cause, which betoken thee. <br>

<b><font size="+1">DE SOMNIIS</font></b> <br>
<font size="+1" face="Symbol">a.</font>&nbsp; CAUSA PER ACCIDENS</p>
</center>
<p>As all diseases have two conjunct causes, one immediate, external and 
exciting, the other constitutional, internal, and predisposing, so it is with 
Dreams, which are Dis-Eases, or unbalanced States of Consciousness, Disturbers 
of Sleep as Thoughts are of Life. </p>
<p>This exciting Cause is commonly of two kinds: <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">videlicet</font></i>, <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">imprimis</font></i>, the physical Condition of 
the Sleeper, as a Dream of Water caused by a shower without, or a Dream of 
Strangulation caused by a Dyspnœa, or a Dream of Lust caused by the seminal 
Congestions of an unclean Life, or a Dream of falling or flying caused by some 
unstable Equilibrium of Body. </p>
<p><i><font face="Century Schoolbook">Secundo</font></i>, the psychic condition 
of the Sleeper, the Dream being determined by recent Events in his Life, usually 
those of the Day previous, and especially such Events as have caused Excitement 
of Anxiety, the more so if they be unfinished or unfulfilled. <br>
But this exciting Cause is of a superficial Nature, as it were a Cloke or a 
Mask; and thus it but lendeth Aspect to the other Cause, which lieth in the 
Nature of the Sleeper himself. <br>
&nbsp; <br>

<font size="+1" face="Symbol">b.</font> CAUSA PER NATURAM</p>
</center>
<p>The deep, constitutional, or predisposing Cause of Dreams lieth within the 
Jurisdiction of the Will itself. For that Will, being alway present, albeit (it 
may be) latent, discovereth himself when no longer inhibited by that conscious 
Control which is determined by Environment, and therefore oft times contrary to 
himself. This being so, the Will declareth himself, as it were in a Pageant, and 
showeth himself thus apparelled, unto the Sleeper, for a Warning or Admonition. 
Every Dream, or Pageant of Fancy, is therefore a Shew of Will; and Will being no 
more prevented by Environment or by Consciousness, cometh as a Conqueror. Yet 
even so he must come for the most Part throned upon the Chariot of the exciting 
Cause of the Dream, and therefore is his Appearance symbolic, like a Writing in 
Cipher, or like a Fable, or like a Riddle in Pictures. But alway does he triumph 
and fulfil himself therein, for the Dream is a natural Compensation in the inner 
World for any Failure of Achievement in the outer. <br>

</center>
<p>Now then if in a Dream the Will be always triumphant, how cometh it that a 
Man may be ridden of the Nightmare? And of this the true Explanation is that in 
such a case the Will is in Danger, having been attacked and wounded or corrupted 
by the Violence of some Repression. Thus the Consciousness of the Will is 
directed to the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh comfort in an 
Externalization, or shew, of that Antagonism. And because the Will is sacred, 
such dreams excite an Ecstasy or Phrenzy of Horror, Fear or Disgust. Thus the 
true Will of Œdipus was toward the bed of Jocasta, but the Tabu, strong both by 
Inheritance and by Environment, was so attached to that Will that his Dream 
concerning his Destiny was a Dream of Fear and of Abhorrence, his Fulfilment 
thereof (even in Ignorance) a spell to stir up all the subconscious Forces of 
all the People about him, and his Realization of the Act a madness potent to 
drive him to self-inflicted Blindness and fury-haunted Exile. <br>

</center>
<p>Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will cannot err; for this is thine 
appointed course in Heaven, in whose order is Perfection. <br>
A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all Warnings; for it 
signifieth that thy Will, which is Thy Self in respect of its Motion, is in 
Affliction and Danger. Thus thou must instantly seek out the Cause of that 
subconscious Conflict, and destroy thine Enemy utterly by bringing thy conscious 
Vigour as an Ally to that true Will. If then there be a Traitor in the 
Consciousness, how much the more is it necessary for thee to arise and extirpate 
him before he wholly infect thee with the divided Purpose which is the first 
Breach in that Fortress of the Soul whose Fall should bring it to the shapeless 
Ruin whose Name is Choronzon! <br>

</center>
<p>The Dream delightful is then a Pageant of the Fulfilment of the true Will, 
and the Nightmare a symbolic Battle between it and its Assailants in thyself. 
But there can be only one true Will, even as there can be only one proper Motion 
in any Body, no matter of how many Forces that Motion be the Resultant. Seek 
therefore this Will, and conjoin with it thy conscious Self; for this is that 
which is written; &quot;Thou hast no right but to do thy Will. Do that, and no other 
shall say nay.&quot; Thou seest, o my Son, that all conscious Opposition to thy Will, 
whether in Ignorance, or by Obstinacy, or through Fear of others, may in the end 
endanger even thy true Self, and bring thy Star into Disaster. </p>
<p>And this is the true Key to Dreams; see that thou be diligent in its Use, and 
unlock therewith the secret Chambers of thine Heart. <br>

</center>
<p>Concerning they Travellings in thy Body of Light, or Astral journeys and 
Visions so-called, do thou lay this Wisdom to thy Heart, o my Son, that in this 
Practice, whether Things Seen and Heard be Truth and Reality, or whether they be 
Phantoms in the Mind, abideth this Supreme Magical Value, namely: Whereas the 
Direction of such Journeys is consciously willed, and determined by Reason, and 
also unconsciously willed, by the true Self, since without It no Invocation were 
possible, we have here a Cooperation of Alliance between the Inner and the Outer 
Self, and thus an Accomplishment, at least partial, of the Great Work. </p>
<p>And therefore is Confusion or Terror in any such Practice an Error fearful 
indeed, bringing about Obsession, which is a temporary or even it may be a 
permanent Division of the Personality, or Insanity, and therefore a defeat most 
fatal and pernicious, a Surrender of the Soul to Choronzon. <br>

do thou work constantly by the Means prescribed in our Holy Books. </p>
<p>Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his four Stations, for 
thereby thou doest affirm thy Place in Nature and her Harmonies. </p>
<p>Neglect not the Performance of the Ritual of the Pentagram, and of the 
Assumption of the Form of Hoor-pa-Kraat. </p>
<p>Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by the Rite of the Gnostic 
Catholic Church, or that of the Phœnix. </p>
<p>Neglect not the Performance of the Mass of the Holy Ghost, as Nature herself 
prompteth thee. </p>
<p>Travel also much in the Empyrean in the Body of Light, seeking ever Abodes 
more fiery and lucid. </p>

</center>
<p>And now concerning Meditation let me disclose unto thee more fully the 
Mystery of the Key of Dreams and Phantasies. </p>
<p>Learn first that as the Thought of the Mind standeth before the Soul and 
hindereth its Manifestation in consciousness, so also the gross physical Will is 
the Creator of the Dreams of common Men, and as in Meditation thou doest destroy 
every Thought by mating it with its Opposite, so must thou cleanse thyself by a 
full and perfect Satisfaction of that bodily will in the Way of Chastity and 
Holiness which has been revealed unto thee in thy Initiation. </p>
<p>This inner Silence of the Body being attained, it may be that the true Will 
may speak in True Dreams; for it is written that He giveth unto His Beloved in 
Sleep. Prepare thyself therefore in this Way, as a good Knight should do. <br>
&nbsp; <br>

<b><font size="-2" face="Symbol">½</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">DE SOMNO LUCIDO</font></b></p>
</center>
<p>Now know this also that at the End of that secret Way lieth a Garden wherein 
is a Rest House prepared for thee. For to him whose physical Needs of whatever 
Kind are not truly satisfied cometh a Lunar or physical Sleep appointed to 
refresh and recreate by Cleansing and Repose; but on him that is bodily pure the 
Lord bestoweth a Solar or Lucid Sleep, wherein move Images of pure Light 
fashioned by the True Will. And this is called by the Qabalists the Sleep of 
Shiloam, and of this doeth also Porphyry make mention mention, and Cicero, with 
many other Wise Men of Old Time. </p>
<p>Compare, o my Son, with this Doctrine that which was taught thee in the 
Sanctuary of the Gnosis concerning the Death of the Righteous; and learn 
moreover that these are but particular Cases of an Universal Formula. <br>

<p><b><font size="+2" face="Symbol">r</font></b> <br>

</center>
<p>My Son, if thou fast awhile, there shall come unto thee a second State of 
physiological Being, in which is a delight passive and equable, without Will, a 
contentment of Weakness, with a Feeling of Lightness and of Purity. And this is 
because the Blood hath absorbed, in its Need of Nutriment, all foreign Elements. 
Such also is the Case with the Mind which hath not fed itself on Thought. 
Consider the placid and ruminent Existence of such Persons as read little, are 
removed from worldy Struggle by some sufficient Property of small and unexciting 
Value, stably invested, and by Age and Environment are free from Passion. They 
live, according to their own Nature, without Desire, and they oppose no 
Resistance to the Operations of Time. Such are called Happy, and in their Way of 
Vegetable Life it is so; for they are free of any Poison. <br>
&nbsp; <br>

<p>20 </p>
<p><b><font size="+2" face="Symbol">s</font></b> <br>
<b><font size="+1">DE MOTU VITAE</font></b></p>
</center>
<p>Learn then, o my Son, that all Phenomena are the effect of Conflict, even as 
the Universe itself is a Nothing expressed as the Difference of two Equalities, 
or, an thou wilt, as the Divorce of Nuit and Hadit. So therefore every Marriage 
dissolveth a more material, and createth a less material Complex; and this is 
our Way of Live, rising ever from Ecstasy to Ecstasy. So then all high Violence, 
that is to say, all Consciousness, is the spiritual Orgasm of a Passion between 
two lower and grosser Opposites. Thus Light and Heat result from the Marriage of 
Hydrogen and Oxygen; Love from that of Man and Woman, Dhyana or Ecstasy from 
that of the Ego and the non-Ego. </p>
<p>But be thou well grounded in this Thesis corollary, that one or two such 
Marriages do but destroy for a Time the Exacerbation of any Complex; to 
deracinate such is a Work of long Habit and deep Search in Darkness for the Germ 
thereof. But this once accomplished, that particular Complex is destroyed, or 
sublimated for ever. <br>

<p><b><font size="+2" face="Symbol">t</font></b> <br>
<b><font size="+1">DE MORBIS SANGUINIS</font></b></p>
</center>
<p>Now then understand that all Opposition to the Way of Nature createth 
Violence. If thine excretory System do its Function not at its fullest, there 
come Poisons in the Blood, and the Consciousness is modified by the conflicts or 
Marriages between the elements heterogeneous. Thus if the Liver be not 
efficient, we have Melancholy; if the Kidneys, Coma; if the Testes or Ovaries, 
loss of Personality itself. Also, an we poison the Blood directly with 
Belladonna, we have Delirium vehement and furious; with Hashish, Visions 
phantastic and enormous; with Anhiolonium, Ecstasy of colour and what not; with 
diverse Germs of Disease, Disturbances of Consciousness varying with the Nature 
of the Germ. Also with Ether, we gain the Power of analysing the Consciousness 
into its Planes; and so for many others. </p>
<p>But all these are, in our mystical Sense, Poisons; that is, we take two 
Things diverse and opposite, binding them together so that they are compelled to 
unite; and the Orgasm of each Marriage is an Ecstasy, the Lower dissolving in 
the Higher. <br>

<p><b><font size="+2" face="Symbol">u</font></b> <br>
<b><font size="+1">DE CURSU AMORIS</font></b></p>

<p>I continue then, o my son, and reiterate that this Formula is general to all 
Nature. And thou wilt note that by repeated Marriage cometh Toleration, so the 
Ecstasy appeareth no more. Thus his half grain of Morphia, which first opened 
his Gates of Heaven, is nothing worth to the Self-poisoner after a Year of daily 
Practice. So too the Lover findeth no more Joy in Union with his Mistress, so 
soon as the original Attraction between them is satisfied by repeated 
Conjunctions. For this Attraction is an Antagonism; and the greater this 
Antinomy, the more fierce the Puissance of the Magnetism, and the Quality of 
Energy disengaged by the Coition. Thus in the Union of Similars, as of Halogens 
with each other, is no strong Passion of explosive Force, and the Love between 
two Persons of the like Character and Taste is placid and without Transmutation 
to higher Planes. <br>

<p>O my Son, how wonderful is the Wisdom of this Law of Love! How vast are the 
Oceans of uncharted Joy that lie before the Keel of thy Ship! Yet know this, 
that every Opposition is in its Nature named Sorrow, and the Joy lieth in the 
Destruction of the Dyad. Therefore, must thou seek ever those Things which are 
to thee poisonous, and that in the highest Degree, and make them thine by Love. 
That which repels, that which disgusts, must thou assimilate in this Way of 
Wholeness. Yet rest not in the Joy of the Destruction of each complex in thy 
Nature, but press on to that ultimate Marriage with the Universe whose 
Consummation shall destroy thee utterly, leaving only that Nothingness which was 
before the Beginning. </p>
<p>So then the Life of Non-Action is not for thee; the Withdrawal from Activity 
is not the Way of the Tao; but rather the Intensification and making universal 
every Unit of thine Energy on every Plane. <br>

<p>Go forth, o my Son, o Son of the Sun, rejoicing in thy Strength, as a 
Warrior, as a Bridegroom, to take thy Pleasure upon the Earth, and in every 
Palace of the Mind, moving ever from the crass to the subtle, from the coarse to 
the fine. Conquer every Repulsion in thy self, subdue every Aversion. Assimilate 
all Poison, for therein only is there Profit. Seek constantly therefore to know 
what is painful and to cleave thereunto, for by Pain cometh true Pleasure. Those 
who avoid Pain physical or mental remain little Men, and there is no Virtue in 
them. Yet be thou ware lest thou fall into the Heresy which maketh Pain, and 
Self-sacrifice as it were Bribes to corrupt God, to secure some future Pleasure 
in an imagined After-life. Nay, also of the other Part, fear not to destroy thy 
Complexes, thinking dreadfully thereby to lose the Power of creating Joy by 
their Distinction. Yet in each Marriage be thou bold to affirm the spiritual 
Ardour of the Orgasm, fixing it in some Talisman, whether it be Art, or Magick, 
or Theurgy. <br>

<p>Say not then that this Way is contrary to Nature, and that in Simplicity of 
Satisfaction of thy Needs is perfection of thy Path. For to thee, who hast 
aspired, it is thy Nature to perform the Great Work, and this is the final 
Dissolution of the Cosmos. For though a Stone seem to lie still on a Mountain 
Top, and have no care, yet hath it an hidden Nature, a Task Ineffable and 
Stupendous; namely, to force its Way to the Centre of Gravity of the Universe, 
and also to burn up its Elements into the final Homogeneity of Matter. Therefore 
the Way of Quiet is but an Illusion of Ignorance. Whoever thou mayst be now, thy 
Destiny is that which I have declared unto thee; and thou art most fixed in the 
true Way when, accepting this consciously as thy Will, thou gathereth up thy 
Powers to move thy Self mightily within it. <br>

<p>But, o my Son, although thine ultimate Nature be Universal, thine immediate 
Nature is Particular. Thy Way to the Centre is not oriented as that of any other 
Being, and thine elements are no kin, but alien, to his. For Shame! Is it not 
the most transcendent of all the Wisdoms of this Cosmos, that no two Beings are 
alike? Lo! This is the Secret of all Beauty, and maketh Love not only possible, 
but necessary, between every Thing and every other Thing. So then, lest thou in 
thine Ignorance take the false Way, and divigate, must thou learn thine own 
particular and peculiar Nature in its Relation to all others. For though it be 
Illusion, it is by the true Analysis of Falsehoods that we are able to destroy 
them, just as the Physician must understand the Disease of his Patient if he is 
to choose the fitting Remedy. Now therefore will I make yet more clear unto thee 
the Value of thy Dreams and Phantasies and Gestures of thine unconscious Body 
and Mind, as Symptoms of thy particular Will, and show thee how thy mayst come 
to their Interpretation. <br>

<p>All Disturbances, o my Son, are Variations from Equilibrium; and just as thy 
conscious Thoughts, Words, and Acts are Effects of the Displacement of the 
conscious Will, so is it in the Unconscious. For the most Part, therefore, all 
Dreams, Phantasies, and Gestures represent that Will subliminal; and if the 
physical Part of that Will be unsatisfied, its Utterance will predominate in all 
these automatic Expressions. Do thou then note what Modifications thereof follow 
such Changes in the conscious Foundation of that Part of thy Will as thou mayst 
make in thy Experiments therewith, and thus separate, as sayeth Trismegistus, 
the fine from the coarse, Fire from Earth, or, as we may say, assign each Effect 
to its true Cause. Seek then to perfect a conscious Satisfaction of every Part 
of that Will, so that the unconscious Disturbances be at last brought to 
Silence. Then will the Residuum be as an Elixir clarified and perfected, a true 
Symbol of that other hidden Will which is the Vector of thy Magical Self. <br>

<p>Learn moreover that thy Self includeth the whole Universe of thy Knowledge, 
so that every increase upon every Plane is an Aggrandizement of that Self. Yet 
the greater Part of this Universe is common Knowledge, so that thy Self is 
interwoven with other Selves, save for that Part peculiar to thy Self. And as 
thou growest, so also this peculiar Part is ever of less Proportion to the 
Whole, until when thou becomest infinite, it is a Quantity infinitesimal and to 
be neglected. Lo! When the All is absorbed within the I, it is as if the I were 
absorbed within the All; for if two Things become wholly and indissolubly One 
Thing, there is no more Reason for Names, since Names are given to mark off one 
Thing from another. And this is that which is written in <i>

there cometh hurt. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all!&quot; <br>

<p>Of the Way of the Tao I have already written to thee, o my Son, but I further 
instruct thee in this Doctrine of doing everything by doing nothing. I will 
first have thee to understand that the Universe being as above said an 
Expression of Zero under the Figure of the Dyad, its Tendency is continually to 
release itself from that strain by the Marriage of Opposites whenever they are 
brought into Contact. Thus thy true Nature is a Will to Zero, or an Inertia, or 
Doing Nothing; and the Way of Doing Nothing is to oppose no Obstacle to the free 
Function of that true Nature. Consider the Electrical Charge of a Cloud, whose 
Will is to discharge itself in Earth, and so release the Strain of its 
Potential. Do this by free conduction, there is Silence and Darkness; oppose it, 
there is Heat and Light, and the Rending asunder of that which will not permit 
free Passage to the Current. <br>

<p>Do not think then that by Non-Action thou doest follow the Way of the Tao, 
for thy Nature is Action, and by hindering the Discharge of thy Potential thou 
doest perpetuate and aggravate the Stress. If thou ease not Nature, she will 
being thee to Dis-Ease. Free thereof every Function of thy Body and of every 
other Part of thee according to its true Will. This also is most necessary, that 
thou discover that true Will in every Case, for thou art born into Dis-Ease; 
where are many false and perverted Wills, monstrous Growths, Parasites, Vermin 
are they, adherent to thee by Vice of Heredity, or of Environment or of evil 
Training. And of all these Things the subtlest and most terrible, Enemies 
without Pity, destructive to thy will, and a Menace and Tyranny even to thy elf, 
are the Ideals and Standards of the Slave-gods, false Religion, false Ethics,

the heavens, which provided you for the Government of the Earth, and her 
Unspeakable Variety! And again: Let there be no Creature upon her or within her

perceiving Beauty in the Harmony of the Diverse. Know then, o my Son, that all 
Laws, all Systems, all Customs, all Ideals and Standards which tend to produce 
Uniformity, being in direct Opposition to Nature's Will to change and to develop 
through Variety, are accursèd. Do thou with all thy Might of Manhood strive

<p>Say not, in thine Haste, that such Stagnations are Unity even as the last

Complexities, and the Ideals and Standards are Attempts to halt thee on that 
Way. Although for thee some certain Ideal be upon thy Path; yet for thy 
Neighbour it may not be so. Set all Men a- horseback: thou speedest the 
Foot-soldier on his Way, indeed: but what hast thou done to the Bird-Man? Thou 
must have simple Laws and Customs to express the general Will, and so prevent 
the Tyranny of Violence of a few; but multiply them not! Now then herewith I

<p>Understand first that the Disturbers of the Peace of Mankind do so by Reason 
of their Ignorance of their own true Wills. Therefore as this Wisdom of mine 
increaseth among Mankind, the false Will to Crime must become constantly more 
rare. Also, the Exercise of our Freedom will cause Men to be born with less and 
ever less Affliction from that Dis-Ease of Spirit, which breedeth these false 
Wills. But, in the while of waiting for this Perfection, thou must by Law assure 
to every Man a Means of satisfying his bodily and his mental Needs, leaving him 
free to develop any Super-Structure in Accordance with his Will, and protecting 
him from any that may seek to deprive him of these vertebral Rights. There shall 
be therefore a Standard of Satisfaction, though it must vary in Detail with 
Race, Climate, and other such Conditions. And this Standard shall be based upon 
a large Interpretation of Facts biological, physiological, and the like. <br>

either by Law or by Custom; there shall be no Penalty either by Loss or

Freedom shall be respected of all, seeing that it is the Right of the Bodily 
Will. For this same Reason thou shalt cause full Restriction and Punishment of 
any who may seek to limit that Freedom for the sake of his own Profit, or 
Desire, or Ideal. Every Man and every Woman has full right either to grant or to 
deny the Body, as the Will speaketh within. This being made Custom, the Evils of 
Love, which are many, extending to the Disturbance not only of Body but of Mind, 
and that in obscure Paths, shall little by little disappear from the Face of His

even that thou dost well to hasten therein, for the whole Matter lieth in thy 
Will, and to force thyself against thy Nature would be an Obstacle to thy 
Passage. But if I urge thee to run well this Race as an Athlete, it is because I 
have perceived in thy Nature that fierce Lust and mighty Concentration in that 
Will, and I write this Letter unto thee, knowing well that thou wilt rejoice 
exceedingly therein, since it is an Expression of thine own Will, and it may be 
a Discovery thereof, which Thing thou vehemently seekest. I charge thee 
therefore that thou permit none to tyrannize any other in Thought, or to 
threaten, or in any other Wise to blaspheme the great Liberty of our Father the 
Sun in the Great Cosmos, or of His Viceregent in the Little. <br>

<p>Now Sentinel to this Fortress standeth a certain Paradox of general 
Application, and in this large Order I will declare it, so that its particular 
Sense may enlighten thee hereafter. And this is the Paradox, that there are 
Bonds which lead to Slavery, and Bonds which lead to Freedom. All we are bound 
in many Fetters by Environment, and it is for ourselves in great Part to 
determine whether they shall enslave us or emancipate us. And I will make clear 
this Thesis to thee by the Way of Illustration. <br>

<p>Consider the Bond of a cold Climate, how it maketh Man a Slave; he must have 
Shelter and Food with fierce Toil. Yet hereby he becometh strong against the 
Elements, and his moral Force waxeth, so that he is Master of such Men as live 
in Lands of Sun where bodily Needs are satisfied without Struggle. </p>
<p>Consider also him that willeth to exceed in Speed or in Battle, how he 
denieth himself the Food he craveth, and all Pleasures natural to him, putting 
himself under the harsh Order of a Trainer. So by this Bondage he hath, at the 
last, his Will. </p>
<p>Now then the one by natural, and the other by voluntary, Restriction have 
come each to greater Liberty. This is also a general Law of Biology, for all 
Development is Structuralization; that is, a Limitation and Specialization of an 
originally indeterminate Protoplasm, which latter may therefore be called free, 
in the Definition of a Pedant. <br>

<p>In the Body every Cell is subordinated to the general physiological Control, 
and we who will that Control do not ask whether each individual Unit of that 
Structure be consciously happy. But we do care that each fulfil its Function, 
and the Failure of even a few Cells, or their Revolt, may involve the Death of 
the whole Organism. Yet even here the Complaint of a few, which we call Pain, is 
a Warning of general Danger. Many Cells fulfil their Destiny by swift Death, and 
this being their Function, they in no wise resent it. Should Hæmoglobin resist 
the Attack of Oxygen, the Body would perish, and the Hæmoglobin would not even 
save itself. How, o my Son, do thou then consider deeply of these Things in 
thine Ordering of the World under the Law of Thelema. For every Individual in 
the State must be perfect in his own Function, with Contentment, respecting his 
own Task as necessary and holy, not envious of another's. For so only mayst thou 
build up a Free State, whose directing Will shall be singly directed to the

Standard of Satisfaction, and that to everyone there be a surplus of Leisure and 
of Energy, so that, his Will of Self-Preservation being fulfilled by the 
Performance of his Function in the State, he may devote the remainder of his 
Powers to the Satisfaction of the other Parts of his Will. And because the 
People are oft times unlearned, not understanding Pleasure, let them be 
instructed in the Art of Life; to prepare Food palatable and wholesome, each to 
this own Taste, to make Clothes according to Fancy, with Variety of 
Individuality and to practise the manifold Crafts of Love. There Things being 
first secured, thou mayst afterward lead them into the Heavens of Poesy and 
Tale, of Music, Painting, and Sculpture, and into the Lore of the Mind itself, 
with its insatiable Joy of all knowledge. Thence let them soar! <br>

<p>Long, o my Son, hath been this Digression from the plain Path of my Word 
concerning Children; but it was most needful that thou shouldst understand the 
Limits of true Liberty. For that is not the Will of any Man which ultimateth in 
his own Ruin and that of all his Fellows; and that is not Liberty whose Exercise 
bringeth him to Bondage. Thou mayst therefore assume that it is always an 
essential Part of the Will of any Child to grow to Manhood or to Womanhood in 
Health, and his Guardians may therefore prevent him from ignorantly acting in 
Opposition thereunto, Care being always taken to remove the Cause of the Error, 
namely, Ignorance, as aforesaid. Thou mayst also assume that it is Part of the 
Child's Will to train every Function of the Mind; and the Guardians may 
therefore combat the inertia which hinders its Development. Yet here is much 
Caution necessary, and it is better to work by exciting and satisfying any 
natural Curiosity than by forcing Application to set Tasks, however obvious this 
Necessity may appear. <br>

<p>Now in this Training of the Child there is one most dear Consideration, that 
I shall impress upon thee as in Conformity with our Holy ?Experience in the Way 
of Truth. And it is this, that since that which can be thought is not true, 
every Statement is in some Sense false. Even on the Sea of pure Reason, we may 
say that every Statement is in some Sense disputable, there fore in every Case, 
even the simplest, the Child should be taught not only the Thesis, but also its 
opposite, leaving the Decision to the Child's own Judgment and good Sense, 
fortified by Experience. And this Practice will develop its Power of Thought, 
and its Confidence in itself, and its Interest in all Knowledge. But most of all 
beware against any Attempt to bias its Mind on any point that lieth without the 
Square of ascertained and undisputed Fact. Remember also, even when thou art 
most sure, that so were they sure who gave instruction to the young Copernicus. 
Pay Reverence also to the Unknown unto whom thou presumeth to impart the 
Knowledge; for he may be one greater than thou. <br>

<p>It is important that thou shouldst understand as early as may be what is the 
true Will of the Child in the Matter of his Career. Be thou well ware of all 
Ideals and Day-dreams; for the Child is himself, and not thy Toy. Recall the 
comic Tragedy of Napoleon and the King of Rome; build not an House for a wild 
Goat, nor plant a Forest for the Domain of a Shark. But be thou vigilant for 
every Sign, conscious or unconscious of the Will of the Child, giving him then 
all Opportunity to pursue the Path which he thus indicates. Learn this, that he, 
being young, will weary quickly of all false Ways, however pleasant they may be 
to him at the Outset; but of the true Way he will not weary. This being in this 
Manner discovered, thou mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for no Man can keep 
open all Roads for ever. And to him making his Choice explain how one may not 
travel far on any Road without a general Knowledge of Things apparently 
irrelevant. And with that he will understand, and bend him wisely to his Work.

<p>I would have thee to consider, o my son, that Word of Publius Vergilius Maro, 
that was the greatest of all the Magicians of his time: <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">in medio tutissimus ibis</font></i>. Which Thing 
has also been said by many wise Men in other Lands; and the Holy Qabalah 
confirmeth the same, placing Tipheret, which is the Man, and the Beauty and 
Harmony of Things, and Gold in the Kingdom of the Metals, and the Sun among the 
Planets, in the Midst of the Tree of Life. For the Centre is the Point of 
Balance of all Vectors. So then if thy wilt live wisely, learn that thou must 
establish this Relation of Balance with every Thing soever, not omitting one. 
For there is nothing so alien from thy Nature that it may not be brought into 
harmonious Relation therewith; and thy Stature of Manhood waxeth great even as 
thou comest to the Perfection of this Art. And there is nothing so close Kin to 
thee it may not be hurtful to thee if this Balance is not truly adjusted. Thou 
hast need of the whole Force of the Universe to work with thy Will; but this 
Force must be disposed about the Shaft of that Will so that there is no Tendency 
to Hindrance or to Deflection. And in my Love of thee I will adorn this Thesis

<p>Consider Love. Here is a Force destructive and corrupting where by many Men 
have been lost. Yet without Love Man were not Man. Therefore thine Uncle Richard 
Wagner made of our Doctrine a musical Fable, wherein we see Amfortas, who 
yielded himself to Seduction, wounded beyond Healing; Klingsor, who withdraw 
himself from a like Danger, cast out for ever from the Mountain of Salvation; 
and Parsifal, who yielded not, able to exercise the true Power of Live, and 
thereby to perform the Miracle of Redemption. Of this also have I myself written 
in my Poema called <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">Adonis</font></i>. It is 
the same with Food and Drink, with Exercise, with Learning itself, the Problem 
is ever to bring the Appetite into right Relation with the Will. Thus thou mayst 
fast or feast; there is no Rule than that of Balance. And this Doctrine is of 
general Acceptation among the better Sort of Men; therefore on thee will I 
rather impress more carefully the other Part of my Wisdom, namely, the Necessity 
of extending constantly thy Nature to new Mates upon every Plane of Being, so

<p>I say in sooth, my son, that this Extension of thy Nature is not in Violation 
thereof; for it is the Nature of thy Nature to grow continually. Now there is no 
Part of Knowledge which is foreign to thee; yet Knowledge itself is of no avail 
unless it be assimilated and co-ordinated into Understanding. Grow therefore, 
easily and spontaneously, developing all Parts equally, lest thou become a 
Monster. And if one Thing tempt thee overmuch, correct it by Devotion to its 
Opposite until Equilibrium be re-established. But seek not to grow by sudden 
Determination toward Things that be far from thee; only, if such a Thing come 
into thy Thought, construct a Bridge thereunto, and take firmly the first Step 
upon the Bridge. I shall explain this. Dost thou speculate upon the Motives of 
the Stars, and on their Elements, their Size and Weight? Then thou must first 
gain Knowledge of Doctrine mathematical, of Laws physical and chemical. So then 
first, that thou mayst understand clearly the Nature of thine whole Work, map 
out thy Mind, and extend its Powers from the essential outwards, from the near 
to the far, always with Firmness and great Thoroughness, making every Link in 
thy Chain equal and perfect. <br>

<p>Yet this I charge thee with my Might: Live Dangerously. Was not this the Word 
of thine Uncle Friedrich Nietzsche? Thy meanest Foe is the Inertia of the Mind. 
Men do hate most those things which touch them closely, and they fear Light, and 
persecute the Torchbearers. Do thou therefore analyse most fully all those Ideas 
which Men avoid; for the Truth shall dissolve Fear. Rightly indeed Men say that 
the Unknown is terrible; but wrongly do they fear lest it become the Known. 
Moreover, do thou all Acts of which the common Sort beware, save where thou hast 
already full knowledge, that thou mayest learn Use and Control, not falling into 
Abuse and Slavery. For the Coward and the Foolhardy shall not live out their 
Days. Every Thing has its right Use; and thou art great as thou hast Use of 
Things. This is the Mystery of all Art Magick, and thine Hold upon the Universe. 
Yet if thou must err, being human, err by excess of courage rather than of 
Caution, for it is the Foundation of the Honour of Man that he dareth greatly. 
What sayth Quintus Horatius Flaccus in the third Ode of his First Book? Die thou 
standing! <br>

<p>Now concerning the first Foundation of thy Mind I will say somewhat. Thou 
shalt study with Diligence in the mathematics, because thereby shall be revealed 
unto thee the Laws of thine own Reason and the Limitations thereof. This Science 
manifesteth unto thee thy true Nature in respect of the Machinery whereby it 
worketh; and showeth in pure Nakedness, without Clothing of Personality or 
Desire, the Anatomy of thy conscious Self. Furthermore, by this thou mayst 
understand the Essence between the Relation of all Things, and the Nature of 
Necessity, and come to the Knowledge of Form. For this Mathematics is as it were 
the last Veil before the Image of Truth, so that there is no Way better than our 
Holy Qabalah, which analyseth all Things soever, and reduceth them to pure 
Number; and thus their Natures being no longer coloured and confused, they may 
be regulated and formulated in Simplicity by the Operation of Pure Reason, to 
thy great Comfort in the Work of our Transcendental Art, whereby the Many become 
One. <br>

<p>My son, neglect not in any wise the Study of the Writings of Antiquity, and 
that in the original Language. For by this thou shalt discover the History of 
the Structure of thy Mind, that is, its Nature regarded as the last term in a 
Sequence of Causes and Effects. For thy Mind hath been built up of these 
Elements, so that in these Books thou mayst bring into the Light thine own 
subconscious Memories. And thy Memory is as it were the Mortar in the House of 
thy Mind, without which is no Cohesion or Individuality possible, so that the 
Lack thereof is called Dementia. And these Books have lived long and become 
famous because they are the Fruits of ancient Trees whereof thou art directly 
the Heir, wherefrom (say I) they are more truly german to thine own Nature than 
Books of Collateral Offshoots, though such were in themselves better and wiser. 
Yes, o my Son, in these Writings thou mayst study to come to the true 
Comprehension of thine own Nature, and that of the whole Universe, in the 
Dimension of Time, even as the Mathematic declareth it in that of Space: That 
is, of Extension. Moreover, by this Study shall the Child comprehend the 
Foundation of Manners: the which, as sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom, maketh 
Man. <br>

<p>Since Time and Space are the Conditions of Mind, these two Studies are 
fundamental. Yet there remaineth Causality, which is the Root of the Actions and 
Reactions of Nature. This also shalt thou seek ardently, that thou mayst 
comprehend the Variety of the Universe, its Harmony and its Beauty, with the 
Knowledge of that which compelleth it. Yet this is not equal to the former two 
in Power to reveal thee to thy Self; and its first Use is to instruct thee in 
the true Method of Advancement in Knowledge, which is fundamentally, the 
Observation of the Like and the Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee the 
Ecstasy of Wonder; and it shall bring thee to a proper Understanding of Art 
Magick. For our Magick is but one of the powers that lie within us undeveloped 
and unanalysed; and it is by the Method of Science that it must be made clear, 
and available to the Use of Man. Is not this a Gift beyond Price, the Fruit of a 
Tree not only of knowledge by to Life? For there is that in Man which is God, 
and there is that also which is Dust; and by our Magick we shall make these 
twain one Flesh, to the Obtaining of the Empery of the Universe. <br>

<p>Give Ear attentively, o my Son, while I expound unto thee the true Doctrine 
of Magick. Every force acteth, in due Proportion, on all Things with which it is 
connected. Thus a burning Forest causes chemical Change by Combustion, and 
giveth Heat and Motion to the Air about it by the Operation of physical Laws, 
and exciteth thought and Emotion in the Man whom it reacheth through his Organs 
of Perception. Consider (even though it were but Legend) the Fall of the Apple 
of Isaac Newton, its Effect upon the Spiritual Destinies of Man! Consider also 
that no Force cometh ever to the end of its work! The Air that is moved by my 
Breath is a Disturbance or Change of Equilibrium that cannot be fully 
compensated and brought to naught, though the Æons be endless. Who then shall 
deny the Possibility of Magick? Well said Frazer, the most learned Doctor of the 
College of the Holy Trinity in the University of Cambridge, that Science was but 
the Name of any Magick which failed not of its intended Effect. <br>

<p>Lo! I put forth my Will, and my Pen moveth upon the Paper, by Cause that my 
will mysteriously hath Power upon the Muscle of my Arm, and these do Work at a 
mechanical Advantage against the Inertia of the Pen. I cannot break down the 
Wall opposite me by Cause that I cannot come into mechanical Relation with it; 
or the Wall at my Side, by Cause that I am not strong enough to overcome its 
Inertia. To win that Battle I must call Time and Pick-axe to mine aid. But how 
could I retard the Motion of the Earth in Space? I am myself Party of its 
Momentum. Yet every Stroke of my Pen affecteth that Motion by changing the 
Equilibrium thereof. The Problem of every Act of Magick is then this: to exert a 
Will sufficiently powerful to cause the required Effect, through a Menstruum or 
Medium of Communication. By the common Understanding of the Word Magick, we 
however exclude such Media as are generally known and understood. Now then, o my 
Son, will I declare unto thee first the Nature of the Power, and afterward that 
of the Medium. <br>

<p>All Things are interwoven. The most spiritual Thought in thy Soul (I speak as 
a Fool) is also a most material Change in Blood or Brain. Anger maketh the Blood 
acid; Hate poisoneth Mother's milk; even as I showed formerly in reverse, how 
Disturbance of physical Function altereth the States of Consciousness. Now no 
Man doubteth the Power of the Will of Man, whether it be his love that begetteth 
Children or causes wars wherein many Men be slain, whether it be his Eloquence 
that moveth a Mob or his Vanity that destroyeth a People. Only in all such Cases 
we understand how Nature worketh, though known Laws physical or psychical. That 
is, there is a State of unstable Equilibrium, so that one Machine setteth 
another in Motion as soon as the first Disturbance ariseth. Therefore, it is not 
proper to regard all Consequence of a Will as its Effect. Without the Revolution 
there could have been no great Effect of the Will of Napoleon; and moreover his 
Will was broken in the End, to the present Misfortune (as it seemeth to many 
besides myself) of Mankind. This Magick therefore, dependeth greatly on the Art 
to set many other Wills in sympathetic Motion; and the greatest Magus may not be 
the most successful in a mean conception of a Limit of Time. He may need to 
strike many Blows before he breaketh down his Wall, if that be strong, while a 
Child may push over one that is ready to crumble. <br>

<p>Behold now nature, how prodigal is She of her Forces! The evident Will of 
every Acorn is to become an Oak; yet night all fail of that Will. Therefore one 
Secret of Magick is Œconomy of thy Force; to do no Act unless secure of its 
Effect. And if every Act has an Effect on every Plane, how canst thou do this 
unless thou be connected with all Planes? For this Reason must thou know 
thoroughly not only thy Body and thy Mind, but thy Body of Light and all its 
subtler Principles soever. But I will have thee consider most especially what 
powers thou hast within thee which are certainly capable of great Effects, yet 
which are constantly wasted. Think then whether, if these Powers, frustrate of 
their End upon one Plane, might not be turned to high Purpose and assured 
Success upon another. For an hundred Acorns, rightly set in Conditions fit for 
their true Growth, will become an hundred Oaks, while otherwise they make but 
one Meal for one Hog, and their subtle Nature is wholly lost to them. Learn 
then, o my Son, this Mystery of Œconomy, and apply it faithfully and with 
Diligence in thy Work. <br>

<p>Here then I must write concerning Talismans for thine Instruction. Know first 
that there are certain Vehicles proper for the Incarnation of the Will. I 
instance Paper, whereon by thine Art thou writest a symbolic Representation of 
thy Will, so that when thou next seest it, thou are reminded of that Will, or it 
may be that another, seeing it, will obey that Will. Here then is a case of 
Incarnation and Assumption, which, before it was understood, was rightly 
considered Gramarye or Magick. Again, thy Will to live causeth thee to plant 
Corn, which in due Season being eaten is again transmuted into Will. Thus thou 
mayst in many Ways impress any particular Will upon the proper Substance, so 
that by due Use thou comest at last to its Accomplishment. So general is this 
Formula, in Truth, that all conscious Actions may be included within its scope. 
There is also the Converse, as when external Objects create Appetite, whose 
Satisfaction again reacteth upon the physical Plane. Praise thou the wonder of 
the Mystery of Nature, rising and falling with every Breath, so that there is no 
Part which is not mystically Partaker of the Whole. <br>

<p>O my Son, there is that within thee of marvellous Puissance which is by its 
own Nature the Incarnation of thy Will, most ready to receive the Seal thereof. 
Therein lie hidden all Powers, all Memories, more than thou hast teen thousand 
fold! Learn then to draw from that great Treasure-House the Jewel of which thou 
art in any present Need. For all things that are possible to thy Nature are 
already hidden within thee; and thou hast but to name them, and to bring them 
back into the Light of thy Consciousness. Then squander not this Gold of thine, 
but put it to most fruitful Usury. Now then of the Art and Craft of this most 
Holy Mystery I write not, for a Reason that thou already knowest. Moreover, in 
this Matter, thou shalt best learn by thine own Experience, and thine 
Observation in true Science shall guide thee. For this Secret is still of 
Magick, and Occult, so that I know not certainly if thy Will lieth with my Way 
or no.</p>
