<p>I am not I. Then, sayst thou, why is this Word? Know o my Son, that this 
first Person is but the common Figure of the Speech of Men whereof the Magus may 
avail himself without Implication of Metaphysick. Yet in the Mystery of 
Illusion, which is the Instrument of the Universal Will, I will not say the 
Harlot of its Pleasure, are manifested these many Stars, and amongst them that 
Logos of the Æon of Horus whom thou callest <font face="Symbol">TO MEGA QHRION</font> 
and thy Father. And this is by-come through Virtue of the Intensity of the Will 
to Change, through many a Serpent-Phase of Life and Death, until in the Play of 
the Game its Manifestation is the Utterance of this Word of the Æon, this Law of 
Thelema, that shall be for a Season the Formula of the Magick of the Earth. Who 
then should inquire of the further Destiny of that Star, or of another? It is 
the Play of the Game, and the Operation of its Function shall suffice it. Rid 
thyself therefore of this Thought of &quot;I&quot; apart from all, but, attaining to 
Consciousness of All by Our True Way, contemplate the Play of Illusion by thine 
Instrument of Mind and Sense, leaving it without Care to continue in its own 
Path of Change. <br>

<p>O my Son, know this concerning the Black Brothers, that cry: I am I. This is 
Falsity and Delusion, for the Law endureth not Exception. So then these Brethren 
are not apart, as they vainly think being wrought by Error; but are peculiar 
Combinations of Nature in Her Variety. Rejoice then even in the Contemplation of 
these, for they are proper to Perfection, and Adornments of Beauty, like a Mole 
upon the Cheek of a Woman. Shall I then say that were it of thine own Nature, 
even thine, to compose so sinister a Complex, thou shouldst not strive 
therewith, destroying it by Love, but continue in that Way? I deny not this 
hastily, nor affirm; nay, shall I even utter a Hint of that which I may foresee? 
For it is in mine own Nature to think that in this Matter the Sum of Wisdom is 
Silence. But this I say, and that boldly, that thou shalt not look upon this 
Horror with Fear, or with Hate, but accept all this as thou dost all else, as a 
Phenomenon of Change, that is, of Love. For in a swift Stream thou mayst behold 
a Twig held steady for a while by the Play of the Water, and by this Analogue 
thou mayst understand the Nature of this Mystery of the Path of Perfection. <br>

<p>Wilt thou acquaint thyself now further at my Reproof concerning this Arcanum 
of Alchymia, the Art Egyptian, how to make Gold? Of a Surety this is already in 
thy Knowledge, if thou examine by Our Holy Qabalah, what be the Forces that are 
the Influx upon Tiphereth, which is the Harmony and Beauty, or Sol, in every 
Kingdom of the Universe, so then also among Metals. Now this Influx is Fivefold. 
First, from the Crown descendeth the High Priestess in the Path of the Moon, for 
Inspiration, and Imagination, and Idea: see to it that this Virgin be Pure, for 
herein Error is Illusion. Next, from the Father floweth the Power of the Emperor 
in the Path of the Ram, for Initiative, and Energy, and Determination. Third, 
from the Mother are the Lovers in the Path of the Twins, for Intellectual 
Wholeness, and for Adjustment to Environment. These Three are from this Superna 
and complete the Theorick of thy Work. After this, in the Praxis and Executive 
thereof thou hast the Hermit as an Influence from the Sphere of Jupiter in the 
Path of the Virgin, for Secrecy, and for Concentration, and for Prudence. 
Lastly, from the Sphere of Mars, travelleth Justice in the Path of the Balance, 
for good Judgment, and Tact, and Art. O my Son, in this Chapter is more wisdom 
than in Ten Thousand Folios of the Alchemists! Study therefore to acquire Skill 
in this Method, and Experience; for this Gold is not only of the Metals, but of 
every Sphere, and this Key is of virtue to enter every Palace of Perfection. <br>

<p>O my Son, hear this Wisdom of Experience, how at thy first Sight, when I put 
thee into the Arms of Ahitha, thy sweet Stepmother my concubine, such was thy 
Beauty that she became enamoured of thee, crying aloud; Ay me, an such he the 
Fruit of thy Magick, o my Master, then let me, me also, even me, give myself 
utterly to this Holy Art! Then did I, becoming heavy in Spirit, make Question of 
her, saying: To what End? And at this was she confounded and brought into 
Bewilderment; but after a great While, fumbling in her Mind, made Answer, like a 
Scarecrow in a Field, so was it for Rags and Tatters of Thought. Thus yet more 
Atrabilious and Sluggard was this Liver of thy Father, so that I fell into a 
Gloom night unto Weeping. Then she beholding me with Amazement cried upon me 
thus: Art thou not glad in Heart, o my Master? At this I gave a Sigh even as one 
night unto Death. And She: if this be so, then is no need anymore for me to give 
myself to Magick. Thereat, perceiving yet again the Just Universal of Our Lord 
Pan, was I swallowed up (like unto Jonah of the Old Fable) in the Belly of the 
Whale called Laughter, and it seemeth to me at this present Writing that I am 
like to abide therein for the Time that remaineth to me in this Body. <br>

<p>Now this is the right Power and Property of a Woman, to arrange and to adjust 
all Things that exist in their proper Sphere, but not to create or to transcend. 
Therefore in all practical Matters is she of Might and of Wit to produce an 
Effect consonant with her Mood. And her Symbol is Water, that seeketh the Level, 
whether for Wrath, eating away the Mountains (yet even in this making smooth the 
Plains) or for Love, in Fecundity of Earth. But it is the Fire of Man that hath 
heaved up those Mountains, in huge Turmoil. Man them maketh Mischief and Trouble 
by his Violence, be his Will convenient to His Environment, or antipathetic; but 
Woman disturbeth by Manipulation, adroit or sinister as her Mood may be of Order 
or of Disorder. For any Man to meddle in her Affair is Folly, for he 
comprehendeth not Quiet; so also for her to emulate him in his Office is 
Fatuity. Therefore in Magick though a Woman excel all men in every Quality that 
is profitable for her for Attainment, yet she is Naught in that Work, even as a 
Man without Hands in the Shop of a Carpenter; for She hath not the Organism that 
might make Use of this Opportunity. Of all this is she aware by her Instinct, 
for her Nature is to Understand, even without Knowledge; and if thou doubt 
herein the Wisdom of thy Sire, do thou seek out a Woman (but with Precaution) 
and affirm these my Words. So shall she wax woundily wrath, and look grisly upon 
thee, proclaiming in a shrill Voice her manifold Excellences, which she hath, 
and concern the Matter not one Whit. <br>

</center>
<p>Of a Thousand Years it is nigh unto the Fiftieth Part, o my Son, since I 
obtained Favour in the Light of a great Master of the Truth, whom Men call Allan 
Bennett, so that he received me for his Disciple in Magick. And he was instant 
with me in this Matter, and vehement, adjuring his Gods that this (which I have 
myself here above declared unto thee) was the Truth concerning the Nature of 
Woman. But I being but a Youth, and Headstrong, and being enraptured in Love of 
Women, and Admiration of Them, and Worship, delighting in them eagerly, and 
learning constantly from them, nourished by the Milk of their Mystery, as it 
should be for all true Men, did resist angrily the Doctrine of that most holy 
Man of God. And because, (as it was written) he was a vowed Virgin from his 
Birth, and had no Commerce with any in the Way of Carnality, I disabled his 
Judgment herein, as if he, being a Fish, had disallowed the Flight of Birds. But 
I, o my Son, am not wholly ignorant of Women, save as all Men must be in the 
Limitation of their Nature, for the Number of my Concubines is not notably or 
shamefully exceeded by that of the Phases of the Moon since my Birth. Many also 
have been my Disciples in Magick that were Women; and (more also) I do owe, 
acknowledging the same with open Gladness, the greater Part of mine own 
Initiation and Advancement to the Operation of Women. Notwithstanding all these 
Things, I bow humbly before Allan Bennett, and repent mine Insolence, for his 
Saying was Sooth. <br>

<p>It is indeed easy for a Woman to obtain the Experience of Magick, in a 
certain Sort, as Visions, Trances, and the like; yet they take not Hold upon 
Her, to transform Her, as with Men, but pass only as Images upon a Speculum. So 
then a Woman advanceth never in Magick, but remaineth the same, rightly or 
wrongly ordered according to the Force that moveth Her. Here therefore is the 
Limit of Her Aspiration in Magick, to abide joyous and obedient beneath the Man 
that her Instinct shall divine so that by Habit becoming a Temple well-ordered, 
comely and consecrated, she may in her next Incarnation attract by her Fitness a 
Man-soul. For this Cause hath Man esteemed Constancy and Patience as Qualities 
preeminent in Good women, because by these she gaineth her Going toward Our 
Godliness. Her Ordeal therefore is principally to resist Moods, which make 
Disorder, that is of Choronzon. Unto the which be Restriction in the Name of <b>
<font size="-1" face="Verdana">B A B A L O N</font></b>. Also, let her be 
content in this Way, for verily she hath a noble and an excellent Portion in Our 
Holy Banquet, and escapeth many a Peril that is proper to us others. Only, be 
she in Awe and Wariness, for in her is no Principle of Resistance to Choronzon, 
so that if she become disordered in her Moods, as by Lust, or by Drunkenness, or 
by Idleness, she hath no Standard whereunto she may rally her Forces. In this 
see thou her Need of a well-guarded Life, and of a True Man for her God. <br>

<p>Mark then, o my Son, how in the Ancient Books of Magick it is Man that 
selleth his Soul unto the Devil, but Woman that maketh Pact with him. For she 
hath constantly the Wit and Power to arrange Things at his Bidding, and she 
payeth this Price of his Alliance. But a Man hath one Jewel, and, bartering 
this, he becometh the Mockery of Satanas. Let then this tutor thee in thine own 
Art of Magick, that thou employ Women in all Practical Matters, to order them 
with Cunning, but Men in thy Need of Transfiguration or Transmutation. In a 
Trope, let the Woman direct the Chess-Play of Life, but the Man alter the Rules, 
if he so will. Lo! in ill Play is Mischief and Disorder, but in a New Law is 
Earthquake, and Destruction of the Root of Things. Therefore is Fear of any Man 
that is in Commerce with his Genius, for none knoweth if his Law shall amend the 
Game or do it Hurt; and of this the Proof is in Experience, won after the 
Victory of his Will, when there is no Way of Return; as saith the Poet, <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum</font></i>. Nor do thou 
fear to create: for, even as I have written in <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of Lies</font></i> (falsely so-called), 
thou canst create nothing that is not God. But beware of false Creations wrought 
by Women in whom is no Function thereof; for they are Phantoms, poisonous 
Vapours, bred of the Moon in her Witchcraft of Blood. <br>

<p>It shall profit thee much, o my Son, or I err, that I instruct thee in the 
Mysteries of the Paths of Nun and of Ayin, that in our rota are figured in the 
Atu called Death, and that called the Devil. Of these Nun joineth the Sun with 
Venus, and is referred to Scorpio in the Zodiac. This Path is perilous, for it 
seeketh the Level, and may abase thee, except thou take Head unto the Going. Of 
its three Modes, the Scorpio destroyeth himself, as if it were a Type of animal 
Pleasure. Next, the Serpent is proper to Works of Change, or Magick; yet is he 
poisonous also unless thou hast Wit to enchant him. Lastly the Eagle is subtlest 
in this Sort, so that this Path is proper to a Transcendental Labour. Yet all 
these are in the Way of Death, so that thy Wand is dissolved and corroded in the 
Waters of the Cup, and must be renewed by Virtue of thy Nature in its Course. 
For Fire is extinguished by Water; but upon Earth it burneth freely, and is 
inflamed by the Wind. Understand also that which is written concerning the 
Vesica, that it is the Mother, giving Ease, Sleep, and Death, which Consolations 
are eschewed by the True Man or Hero. <br>

<p>Now the Path of Ayin is a Link between Mercury and the Sun, and in the Zodiac 
importeth the Goat. This Goat is called also Strength, and standeth in the 
Meridian at the Sunrise of Spring; and it is His Nature to leap upon the 
Mountains. So therefore he is a Symbol of true Magick, and his Name is Baphomet, 
wherefore did I design him as an Atu of Thoth, the Fifteenth, and put his Image 
in the Front of my Book, <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">The Ritual of High 
Magick</font></i>, which was the second Part of my Thesis for the Grade of Major 
Adept, when I was clothed about with the Body called Alphonse Louis Constant. 
Now the Goat flieth not as doth the Eagle; but consider this also that it is the 
true Nature of Man to dwell upon the Earth, so that his Flights are oft but 
Phantasy; yea, the Eagle also is bound to his Eyrie, nor feedeth upon Air. 
Therefore this goat, making each leap with Fervour, yet all Times secure in his 
own Element, is a true Hieroglyph of the Magician. Mark also, this Path sheweth 
One continuous in Exaltation upon a Throne, and so is it the Formula of the Man, 
as the other was of the Woman. <br>

</center>
<p>I say furthermore that this Path is of the Circle, and of the Eye of Horus 
that sleepeth not, but is vigilant. The Circle is all-perfect, equal every Way, 
but the Vesica hath bitter Need, and seeketh thy Medicine, that is of right 
compounded for High Purpose, to ease her Infirmity. Thus is thy Will frustrated, 
and thy Mind distracted, and thy Work lamed, if it be not brought to Naught. 
Also thy Puissance in thine Art is minished, by a full Moiety, as I do esteem 
it. But the Eye of Horus hath no Need, and is free in his Will, not seeking a 
Level, or requiring a Medicine, and is fit and worthy to be the Companion and 
the Ally of thee in thy Work, as a Friend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, 
that seek ever with Slyness and Deceit to encompass their own Ends. There is 
moreover a Reason in Physics for my Word; study thou this matter in the Laws of 
the Changes of Nature. For Things Unlike do in their Marriage produce a Child 
which is relatively Stable, and resisteth Change; but Things like increase 
mutually the Potential of their particular Natures. Howbeit, each Path hath his 
own Use; and thou, being instructed in all Ways, choose thine with Discretion.

<p>My son, my Delight, Honey of the Comb of my Life, I will say also this 
concerning the Odds of the Formulæ of Male and Female, that mine Initiation was 
ordered as followeth. First, unto the Middle of the Way, the Attainment of the 
Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, were these Men appointed 
to mine Aid, Jerome Politt of Kendal, Cecil Jones of Basingstoke, Allan Bennett 
of the Border, and Oscar Exkenstein of the Mountain with no Woman. But after 
that Attainment hath Word come to me only through Women, Ouarda the Seer, and 
Virakam, and in mine Initiation in to the Degree of Magus, the Cat '<font face="Symbol">ILARIWN</font> 
thy Mother, Helen the Play Actress the Serpent, with Myriamme the Drunkard, and 
Rita the Harlot to bear Dagger and Poison; then these others Alice the Singing 
Woman for an Owl; then Catherine the Dog of Anubis, and Ahitha the Camel that 
renewed the Work of Virakam, with Ollun the Dragon and --- but here I do 
restrict myself in Speech, for the End is wrapped about with a Veil, as the Face 
of a Virgin. But do thou meditate strictly upon these Things, distinguishing the 
right Property, Order, and Use of the Other and the other in the Relative, even 
as thou makest them All-One, that is None, in the Absolute. <br>

<p>Recall, o my Son, the Fable of the Hebrews, which they brought from the City 
Babylon, how Nebuchadnezzar the Great King, being afflicted in his Spirit, did 
depart from among Men for Seven Years' Space, eating Grass as doth an Ox. Now 
this Ox is the Letter Aleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose Number is Zero, and 
whose name is Maat, Truth, or Maut, the Vulture, the All-Mother, being an Image 
of Our Lady Nuit, but also it is called the Fool, who is Parsifal, &quot;der reine 
Thor&quot;, and so referreth to him that walketh in the Way of the Tao. Also, he is 
Harpocrates, the Child Horus, walking, (as saith David, the Badavi that became 
King in his Psalms) upon the Lion and the Dragon; that is, he is in Unity with 
his own secret Nature, as I have shewn thee in my Word concerning the Sphinx. O 
my Son, yester Eve came the Spirit upon me that I also should eat the Grass of 
the Arabs, and by Virtue of the Bewitchment thereof behold that which might be 
appointed for the Enlightenment of mine Eyes. Now then of this may I not speak, 
seeing that it involveth the Mystery of the Transcending of Time, so that in One 
Hour of our terrestrial Measure did I gather the Harvest of an Æon, and in Ten 
Lives I could not declare it. <br>

<p>Yet even as a Man may set up a Memorial or Symbol to import Ten Thousand

And here shall thine own Experience serve us, because a Token of Remembrance 
sufficeth him that is familiar with a Matter, which to him that knoweth it not 
should not be made manifest, no, not in a Year of Instruction. Here first then 
is one amid the uncounted Wonders of that Vision; upon a field blacker and 
richer than Velvet was the Sun of all Being, alone. Then about Him were little 
Crosses, Greek, over-running the Heaven. These changed from Form to Form 
geometrical, Marvel devouring Marvel, a Thousand Times a Thousand in their 
Course and Sequence, until by their Movement was the Universe churned into the 
Quintessence of Light. Moreover at another Time did I behold All Things as 
Bubbles, iridescent and luminous, self-shining in every Colour, Myriad pursuing 
Myrad until by their perpetual Beauty they exhausted the Virtue of my Mind to 
receive them, and whelmed it, so that I was fain to withdraw myself from the 
Burden of that Brilliance. Yet, o my Son, the Sun of all this amounteth not to 
the Worth of one Dawn-Glimmer of Our True Vision of Holiness. <br>

<p>Now for the Chief of that which was granted unto me, it was the Apprehension 
of those willed Changes or Transmutations of the Mind which lead into Truth, 
being as Ladders unto Heaven, or so I called them at that Time, seeking for a 
Phrase to admonish the Scribe that attended on my Words, to grave a Balustre 
upon the Stele of of my Working. But I make Effort in vain, o my Son, to record 
this matter in Detail; for it is the quality of the Grass to quicken the 
Operation of Thought it may be Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each Step in 
Images complex and overpowering in Beauty, so that one hath no Time wherein to 
conceive, much less to utter, any Word for a Name or any of them. Also, such was 
the multiplicity of these Ladders, and their Equivalence, that the Memory 
holdeth no more any one of them, but only a certain Comprehension of the Method, 
wordless by Reason of its Subtility. Now therefore must I make by my Will a 
Concentration mighty and terrible of my Thought, that I may bring forth this 
Mystery in Expression. For this Method is of Virtue and Profit, by it mayst thou 
come easily and with Delight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no Odds from what 
Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy Meditation, so hat thou mayst know how 
every Road endeth in Monsalvat, and the Temple of the Sangraal. <br>

<p>I believe generally, on Ground both of Theory and Experience, so little as I 
have, that a Man must first be initiate, and established in Our Law, before he 
may use this Method. For in it is an Implication of our Secret Enlightenment, 
concerning the Universe, how its Nature is utterly Perfection. Now every Thought 
is a Separation, and the Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its 
Contradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writings. And thou shalt clap 
the one to the other with Vehemence of Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the 
Ecstasy be spontaneous. So therefore it is Expedient that thou have travelled 
already in this Path of Antithesis, knowing perfectly the Answer to every Griph 
or Problem, and thy Mind ready therewith. For by the Property of this Grass all 
passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, and an Hesitation should confound thee, 
breaking down thy ladder, and throwing back thy Mind to receive Impression from 
Environment, as at thy first beginning. Verily; the nature of this Method is 
Solution, and the Destruction of every Complexity by Explosion of Ecstasy, as 
every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, and is annihilated (since 
it loseth separate Existence) in the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed 
of thy Mind. <br>

</center>
<p>Thou knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought is imperfect in two 
Dimensions, being separate from its Contradiction, but also constrained in its 
Scope, because by that Contradiction we do not (commonly) complete the Universe, 
save only that of its Discourse. Thus if we contrast health with Sickness, we 
include in their Sphere of Union no more than one Quality that may be predicated 
of all Things. Furthermore, it is for the most Part not easy to find or to 
formulate the true Contradiction of any Thought as a positive Idea, but only as 
a Formal Negation in vague Terms, so that the ready Answer is but the 
Antithesis. Thus to &quot;White&quot; one putteth not the Phrase &quot;all that which is not 
White&quot;, for this is void, formless; it is neither clear, simple, nor positive in 
Conception; but one answereth &quot;Black&quot;, for this hath an Image of his 
Significance. So the Cohesion of Antitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and

<p>Lean now that Impression of Sense have Opposites readily conceived, as long 
to short, or light to dark; and so with Emotions and Perceptions, as Love to 
Hate, or false to true; but the more violent is the Antagonism, the more is it 
bound in Illusion, determined by Relation. Thus the Word &quot;Long&quot; hath no Meaning 
save it be referred to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because Hate is 
its Twin, partaking bountifully of a Common Nature therewith. Now, hear this; it 
was given unto me in my Visions of the Æthyrs, when I was in the Wilderness of 
Sahara, by Tolga, that above the Abyss, contradiction is Unity, and that Nothing 
could be true save by Virtue of the Contradiction that is contained in itself. 
Behold, therefore, in this method thou shalt come presently to Ideas of this 
Order, that include in themselves their own Contradiction, and have no 
Antithesis. Here then is thy Lever of Antinomy broken in thine Hand; yet, being 
in true Balance, thou mayst soar, passionate and eager, from Heaven to Heaven, 
by the Expansion of thine Idea, and its Exaltation, of Concentration as thou 
understandest by thy Studies in <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of 
the Law</font></i>, the Word thereof concerning Our Lady Nuit and Hadit that is 
the Core of every Star. And this last Going upon thy Ladder is easy, if thou be 
truly Initiate, for the Momentum of thy Force in Transcendental Antithesis 
serveth to propel thee, and the Emancipation from the Fetters of Thought that 
thou hast won in that Praxis of Art maketh the Whirlpool and Gravitation of 
Truth of Competence to Draw thee unto itself. <br>

<p>This is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this Holy Herb, the Grass of the 
Arab, that it has shewed me this Mystery (with many others) not as a new Light, 
for I had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and Manifestation of a Long 
Sequence of Events in a Moment, I had Wit to analyse this Method, and to 
discover its Essential Law, which before had escaped the Focus of the Lens of 
mine Understanding. Yea, o my Son, there is no true Path of Light, save that 
which I have formerly made plain; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be 
cunning to perceive it and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes by 
Reflection or by the Composition and Selection of an Artist in his Presentation 
thereof, when else we were blind thereunto; lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were 
that Art of none avail unless we had already the Root of that Truth in our 
Nature, and a Bud ready to flower at the Summoning of that Sun. In Witness, nor 
a Boy nor a Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone, and their 
Properties; but thou mayst teach these to the Boy by right Presentation, because 
he hath in his Nature those laws of Mind that are consonant with our Art 
Mathematical, and hath Need only of the Fledging (I may say this) so that he 
apply them consciously to the Work, when all being in Truth, that is, in the 
necessary Relations that rule our Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension.

<p>Thus I was brought unto the Knowledge of myself in a certain secret Grace, 
and as a Poet, by Jerome Politt of Kendal; Oscar Eckenstein of the Mountain 
discovered Manhood in me, teaching me to endure Hardship, and to dare many 
Shapes of Death; also he nurtured me in Concentration, the Art of the Mystics, 
but without Lumber of Theology. Allan Bennett bestowed upon me the right Art of 
Magic, and Our Holy Qabalah, with a great Treasure of Learning in many Matters, 
but especially concerning Egypt, and Asia, the Mysteries of their Arcane Wisdom. 
But of Cecil Jones had I the Great Gift of the Holy Magick of Abramelin, and he 
inducted me into that Order which we name not, because of the Silliness of the 
Profane that pretend thereto, and he brought me to the Knowledge and 
conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel; also, he was the Herald of the Masters 
of the Temple when They bade me welcome to their Order, appointing a Siege for 
me in the City of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan; but for three Years I 
was not willing to avail myself thereof. Now mark well this, o my Son, that this 
Path was peculiar to the law of my Star, and none other should follow me herein, 
or seek to follow me, for he hath his own proper Orbit. O my Son, err not by 
Generalisation and Conformity, for this is the very Idleness, and breedeth

<p>Nevertheless, this one Affliction shall touch nigh all that come to thee, and 
that is this great Pox of Sin, that is our Bane inherited of the Æon of Slain 
Gods. Look the first of all, when any Postulant boweth before thee, whether 
there be not Conflict and Restriction in his Mind, and in his Will. If he deem 
Good and Evil to be absolute, instead of as relative to the Health of this Body, 
or the Weal of the Society of which he is a Member, or what not, as it may be, 
instruct him. Or, if he will say that he will sacrifice all for Initiation, 
correct him, as it is written: &quot;but whoso gives one Particle of Dust shall lose 
all in that Hour.&quot; For it is Conflict if he weigh one Thing with another; and 
Renunciation, being sorrowful, is not worthy of Acceptance. But he must with Joy 
unite all he is and hath, heaping the Whole into one Billow of Love, under Will. 
Yea, o my son, until thou hast brought the Postulant into our Freedom from Sin, 
and the Sense and Conviction thereof, he is not ready for the Path of our Magick 
and Illumination; because every Way soever is a Going, and this Sin is an 
obstacle and a Fetter and an Hoodwink on every one of them, for it is 
Restriction, whether he set out by the Meditations of the Dhamma, or by Our 
Qabalah, or by Vision or Theurgy, or how else soever. <br>

<p>How shall a Man attain to the Trance where All is One, if he yet debate

those that are fuddled with Doubt whether Meat is to be eaten (I choose this as 
a Reference with Habit is proper to the Lion, as Grass to the Horse, so that his 
right Problem is solely thus, what is fitting to his own Nature. Or again, I 
suppose that he is in Vision, and an Angel, visiting him, imparteth a Truth 
contrary to his Prejudice, as it fell out in mine own Case, when I inhabited the 
Body of Sir Edward Kelly, or so do I in Part remember, as it seemeth dimly. This 
nevertheless is sure (or the learned Casaubon, publishing the Record of that 
Word with the Magician Dee, sayeth falsely) that an Angel did declare unto Kelly 
the very Axiomata of our Law of Thelema, in good Measure, and plainly; but Dee, 
afflicted by the Fixity of his Tenets that were of the Slave-Gods, was wroth, 
and by his Authority prevailed upon the other, who was indeed not wholly 
perfected as an Instrument, or the World ready for that Sowing. Consider also 
how in this very Life I was the Enemy of mine own Law, and wrote down <i>
<font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of the Law</font></i> contrary to my 
conscious Will by the Virtue of Obedience as a Scribe, and strove constantly to

Also, ever for them that are fitted to advance in our Light, there is Order and

it might well be that, in a Profess-House of the Temple, or College of the Holy 
Ghost, each Knight or Brother might severally attain Experience of every Trance, 
unto the Perfection of all Illumination; yet by this there ought not to arise 
Confusion, one usurping the appointed office of another. For the Abbot, although 
he be not enlightened wholly, is yet Abbot; and the Place of the Cook, were he 
Saint, Arhan, and Paramahamsa in one Person, is in his Kitchen. Confound not 
thou in any wise therefore the Degree of Attainment of any Man with his right 
Function in our Holy Order; for although by initiation cometh the Light, and the 
Right, and the Might to accomplish all Works soever, yet these are inoperative 
save as they are able to use a Machine which is of the same Order of Things as

in their Insolence that if we have all Power, why are we betimes in Stress of 
Poverty, and in Contempt of men, and in Pain of Disease, and so forth, mocking

guideth us in our Path unto a Goal that is not in their Comprehension, so that 
we crave not that which seemeth to them the Sole Food and Comfort of Life. Also, 
this which we attain, though it be the Essence of Omniscience and Omnipotence, 
informeth and moveth the Material World (so to call it) only according to the 
Nature of that which is therein. For the Light of the Sun (by His very Wholeness 
itself) sheweth a Rose Red, but a Leaf Green; and His Heat gathereth the Clouds, 
and disperseth them also. So I then, though I were perfect ion Magick, might not 
work in Metals as a Smith, or become rich by Commerce as a Merchant; for I have 
not in my Nature the Engines proper to these Capacities, and therefore it is not 
of my will to seek to exercise them. Here then is my Case, that I can not 
because I will not, and it were Conflict, should I turn thither. But let every 
man become perfect in his own Work, not heeding the Rebuke of another, that some 
Way not his own is more Noble, or Profitable, but being constant in mindfulness

Bereavement, because to us every Event is Welcome, being right, necessary and

Lady Nuit even as Her Lord Hadit, so that the Gnostic Sacrament of the Cosmos is 
perpetually Elevated before us. We behold all that is and comprehend its 
Mystery, and its Order in this High Mass eternally celebrated among us, 
acknowledging the Perfection of the Rite, neither confusing the Parts thereof, 
nor discriminating in Worship between them. So unto us is every Phenomenon a 
Shew of Godliness, proceeding continually in a Pageant that returneth unto 
itself, identical in the Phase of Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia 
of Ineffable Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of Beauty in 
Variety inexhaustible. Shall the Initiate bestir him, to better so prime a 
Perfection? Nay, this Will that was his is accomplished; he hath attained the 
Summit; so without Hope or Fear he abideth, and leaveth his Vehicle of Illusion 
and Magical Engine, that is, as Man say, his Body and Mind, to work out their 
Ritual of Change without his interference. O my son, ask not to what End! As it

<p>Thou hast made Question of me concerning Death, and this is my Opinion, of 
which I say not: this is the Truth. First in the Temple called Man is the God, 
his Soul, or Star, individual and eternal, but also inherent in the Body of Our 
Lady Nuit. Now this Soul, as an Officer in the High Mass of the Cosmos, taketh 
on the Vesture of his Office, that is, inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Illusion, a 
Body and Mind. And this Tabernacle is Subject to the Law of Change, for it is 
complex, and diffuse reacting to every Stimulus or Impression. If then the mind 
be attached constantly to the Body, Death hath no Power to decompose it wholly, 
but a decaying Shell of the dead Man, his Mind holding together for a little his 
Body of Light, haunteth the Earth, seeking a new Tabernacle (in its Error that 
feareth Change) in some other Body. These Shells are broken away utterly from 
the Star that did enlighten them, and they are Vampires, obsessing them that 
adventure themselves into the Astral World without Magical Protection, or invoke 
them, as do the Spiritists. For by Death is Man released only from the Gross 
Body, at the first, and is complete otherwise upon the Astral Plane, as he was 
in his Life. But this Wholeness suffereth Stress, and its Girders are loosened, 
the weaker first and after that the stronger. <br>

<p>Consider now in this Light what shall come to the Adept, to him that hath 
aspired constantly and firmly to his Star, attuning the Mind unto the Musick of 
its Will. In him, if his Mind be knit perfectly together is itself, and 
conjoined with the Star, is so strong a Confection that it breaketh away easily 
not only from the Gross Body, but the fine. It is this Fine Body which bindeth 
it to the Astral, as did the Gross to the Material World so then it 
accomplisheth willingly the Sacrament of a second Death and leaveth the Body of 
Light. But the Mind, cleaveth closely, by Right of its Harmony, and Might of its 
Love, to its Star, resisteth the Ministers of Disruption, for a Season, 
according to its Strength. Now, if this Star be of those that are bound by the 
Great Oath, incarnating without Remission because of Delight in the Cosmic 
Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle in the appointed Way, and indwelleth the 
Fœtus of a Child, and quickeneth it. And if at this Time the mind of its Former 
Tabernacle yet cling to it, then is there Continuity of Character, and it may be 
Memory, between the two Vehicles. This is, briefly and without Elaboration, is

of Separation, and its Cessation by the Union of Live, it is the Summit of our

our Bodily Death. We are then to make our whole Engine the true and real 
Appurtenance of our Force, without Leak, or Friction, or any other Waste or 
Hindrance to its Action. Thou knowest well how an Horse, or even a Machine 
propelled by a Man's feet, becometh as it were as Extension of the Rider, though 
his Skill and Custom. Thus let thy Star have profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating 
it, and sustaining it, so that it be healed of its Separation, and this even in 
Life, but most especially in Death. Also thou oughtest to increase thy Vehicle

<p>There is a named Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis concerning Will that it 
should flow freely in its Way: <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">vide licet</font></i>, 
that for such as I am it is well, because I am endowed by Nature with a Lust 
insatiable in every Kind, so that the Universe itself seemeth incapable to 
appease it. For I have poured myself out unceasingly, in Bodily Passion, and in 
Battles with Men, and with Wild Beasts, and with Mountains and Deserts, and in 
Poetry and other Writings of the Musick of mine Imagination, and in Books of our

create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim the Reward and the Recreation of my 
Death. But (I hear thee say it) this is not the Case of All, or even of many, 
Men; but their Act of Will is satisfied easily at its first Guerdon. Should not 
then their Wisdom be to resist themselves for a Space, as Water heaped up by a 
Dam gathereth Force, and Hunger feedeth upon Abstinence? Also, there is that 
which I have written in a former Chapter of the right Use of Discipline; and

that every Act of Will is to be made in its Perfection, which State is to be 
attained according to these Conditions: firs, those of its own Law; second, 
those of its Environment. Judge thine own Case individually, each as it pleadeth; 
for there is no Cannon or Code, since every Star hath its own Law diverse from 
every other. Now there is the Restraint of Conflict which is Impotence and 
Disruption; the the Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by 
Repose and by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his Armies, and feedeth them, 
and looketh to their Furniture and to their Spirit, before he joineth the 
Battle. Also, there is the Restraint of Art, which includeth that other of 
Discipline, and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to admire its Strength and 
its Beauty, and to enjoy its Victory by Anticipation in full Confidence, not 
fearful of Time that robbeth them that are ignorant concerning him, how he is 
but Mirage and Illusion, incapable to besiege the Fortress of the Soul. Work 
thou thy Will, knowing (as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphas Levi Zahed), 
thyself Omnipotent, and thine Habitation Eternity. O my Son, attend well this

therein! But exceed! exceed!&quot; Thus thou mayst even toy with thy tamed Devil of 
Sin, and use the Pain thereof to sharpen the taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and 
thy Tongue keen to the Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is opposite 
to this in his Preference; or as a skilled Match of Love aboundeth in Pinchings, 
Slappings, Bitings and the like, to intensify the Bout and to prolong it. But 
this is Risk and Peril, unless thou be wholly Master, One in thy Will; for there

deceived by this Play so that they deem it the Division of Hate, She can but 
speak in Simplicity by that Word written in <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">

is but Emptiness; and its cruelty is Cruelty indeed, except thou know it to be

dimmeth the Light by Cunning of his Shadows. But all this Delight that thou 
mayst have of the Universe both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is a Reward of

<p>O my Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but Misunderstanding of the 
Art of Love of Our Lady Nuit. Yea, verily, it is all a Trick of Her Wit, and a 
Device of Her Delight, that Sin should appear, and also (mark thou well!) the 
Misapprehension of its Nature. Therefore the Pain of any Sinner in his Division 
and His Separation is to Her a little Spasm of Pleasure. But as for him, let him 
apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolve himself in Her Love. Thou then, being 
Initiate and Illuminated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow, or rather 
that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy that thou hast in thy True Self, the 
Star among the Stars of Her Body. The Adept of our Art is not compassionate 
concerning Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unless the Healing thereof were 
proper to his Will, for he is aware of the whole Truth of the Matter. So goeth 
he upon his Way, and tighteneth not a Rein upon the Horses of the Universe, but 
is content, beholding the Speed of their Course. Verily, o my Son, it is well 
written in <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of the Magus</font></i> 
that it is the Curse of my Grade that I must needs preach my Law unto Men. For I 
am afflicted in my Tabernacle on this Count, but in my Self, I rejoice, and join 
in the Laughter of Her Love. <br>

<p><b><font size="+1">DE CAECITIA PHILOSOPHORUM ANTIQUORUM</font></b></p>

<p>Behold, how comfortable is this my Wisdom, wherein I have resolved every 
Conflict soever that is or that can be, even in all Dimensions, that Antagonism 
of Things no less than their Limitations. I have said: Evil, be thou my Good; 
for it is the Magical Mirror of our Astarté, and the Caduceus of our Hermes. Now 
this was the Error of Elder Philosophers, that perceiving Changeful Duality as 
the Cause of Sorrow, they sought the Reconcilement in Unity and in Stability. 
But I shew thee the Universe as the Body of Our Lady Nuit, who is None and Two, 
with Hadit Her Lord as the Alternator of those Phases. This Universe is then a 
perpetual By-coming, the Vessel of every Permutation of infinity, wherein every 
Phenomenon is a Sacrament, Change being the act of Love, and Duality the 
Condition prodromal to that Act even as an Axe must be taken back from a Cedar 
that it may deliver its Stroke. The Error therefore of thee Philosophers lay in 
their false Assumption that Bliss, Knowledge and Being (the Qualities of their 
Changeless Unity) could be States. O my Son, how pitiful is their Beggary, these 
Paupers of Sense and of Experience and of Observation! The Emptiness of their 
Bellies was it that bred Phantoms of Ideal, so that they sought Joy by a crude 
Denial of what Truth (or rather, Fact) they had perceived concerning the 
Universe, so that they set up an Idol of Death for their God, in very Rage of 
Hatred against the Sum of their own Selves. <br>

<p>These Philosophers, or shall I not say Misosophers and Pseudo-Sophists, have 
been hard put to it to explain the Mystery of the Existence of their Evil. They 
have cried, frothing with Words, the Evil is Illusion. But if so, that Illusion 
is Evil, whence came it, and to what End? If their Devil created it, who created 
that Devil? All their contention resolveth to this Dilemma of Change in a 
Changeless, Falsity in a True, Hate in a Loving, Weakness in an Almighty, 
Duality in a Simple, Being as they define their God. Nor do they see that they 
restrict their God (whom yet they would have to be All) by admitting Opposites 
to this Nature, ever when they sum these Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion 
is the Denial of His Truth. But the Indians, seeing this, seek Escape by denying 
all Duality soever to their God, or True State, I speak of Parabrahman and of 
Nibbana, thus in any Reality of Thought rather denying Him or It than destroying 
Illusion. But in our Light we have no Need of any Denial, and accept all, yea, 
Illusion itself, discriminating only in our Minds between Phenomena by 
Comparison with some convenient Standard, for the Purpose of maintaining the 
Order of our Conceptions in Respect of the Relation of any Being with its 
Environment. <br>

<p>So do thou apprehend this Wisdom, o my Son, laying it to thine Heart, as a 
Mistress, and hiding it in the Treasury of thy Mind as a Jewel of Enlightenment. 
Consider a Dream, how it is unreal in Respect of thine Experience of the Objects 
of thy Waking Sense, but real also, both as it did in Fact impress thy Mind, and 
as it did express some Hunger of thy Secret Nature, as I have already shewed in 
this Letter. Consider the Play of the Chess, how its Law hath made for itself a 
Language and a Literature, yet it is but an arbitrary invention; without 
impinging (save as it operateth though Pleasure and Interest upon Minds) on any 
other Sphere soever of the Universe. Equally, Things called (vulgarly) Real and 
Material exist in the Universe of our Consciousness only by the Apprehension of 
their Images in Mind through Sense; as, how is Colour Real or Material to a 
blind man; or a Law mathematical true to him that is imbecile or demented. All 
Things therefore, even if unreal and irrational, nay, inconceivable and 
impossible (such as Iota in the Theorem of De Moivre), exist in one Form or 
another; but the Reality of any, though in itself absolute, is in Regard of its 
Relation with any other thing dependent upon the Intercourse and Language 
between them, conscious or unconscious. Consider Azote, that hath nigh Four 
Parts in Five of the Air, how it is not real to direct Perception of any human 
Sense, but yet most real to our Lungs, diluting the Oxygen, by whose Love we 
were else violently combust. This is the Measure of Reality. <br>

<p>My son, long did I await thee, yearning, and with Price and Great Gladness 
did I bid thee Welcome to my City of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan. Now 
then in my dear Love of thee will I reveal this Secret of Wisdom which I wrote 
occultly in my last Chapter, in these Words: All Things Exist. Considered by 
right Understanding, this is to deny that there is anything imaginable or 
unimaginable which doth not exist. That is, the Body of Our Lady Nuit hath no 
Limit, and there is no void that She filleth not with the Variety and Beauty of 
Her Stars in Her Space. Nor is there any one Law of her Nature, but in Her are 
all Laws, so that each Thing or each Truth that thou perceiveth is as it were 
one Gesture of Her Dance. Shut up the Book of thy Questions, o my Son, 
concerning nature, Her Way, Her Origin, or Her Purpose, except in those Matters 
which concern thee and thine own Orbit, o thou Star, begotten of my Loins in my 
Lust of Hilarion, the Golden Rose, mystic and Joyous, the Lily of a Thousand 
Petals and One Petal, subtle and perverse, that thou mightest fulfil this Work 
of a Magus which I cam to accomplish, robing myself in Flesh of man, as was my 
Nature and the Will of my Nature, the Name of my Star that flameth in the Body 
of Nuit our Lady. <br>

wherefore this Part of me is in Truth thou rather than I. Yet do thou treasure

Wisdom, and flameth, being the Blood of my Love of thee and of Mankind. Also, it 
is the Word of my Will, the Charter of the Liberty of my Soul, and thine, and 
that of every Man, and every Woman; for we are Stars, O my Son, for many Days 
was I silent, until thou wast fearful lest thou hadst, by Ignorance or by 
Inadvertance, enkindled the Fire of my Wrath. But I spake not, because I knew in 
my Wisdom that thou must pass a certain Ordeal of thine Initiation by thine own 
Virtue. For this Cause I held aloof; but in my Love I made a Beginning of this 
Letter, beholding thy triumph beforehand; and with Prescience, divining thy next 
Need, that is to say, this Book of the Words of my Wisdom. <br>

<p>O my Son, in this Letter have I written the Name of my own Nature, its Law, 
its Quality, its Will and its Appurtenance or Ornament. For it is the Child of 
my Love toward thee, and the Expression through mine Art of my Will so far as 
that regardeth thee. Now every Child is made of the Essence of his Father, so 
that every Creation is a Likeness or Image of the Creator, but modified by the 
Mother, that is to say, the Material whereon he begetteth it. So then this 
Letter is a Projection of mine own Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in thy 
Regard; and it shall be unto thee as a clear Vision of thy Father, and of the 
Word of the Æon that he hath uttered unto Man. But also, because this Word is 
the Formula of the Æon, that is the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, the 
Equation that expresseth its Energy and its Motion, it shall serve every Man in 
his Measure as a Text-Book or Comment upon the Theorick and Praxis of Magick. By 
it may he discover his true Nature, and its Will, and apply his Force and his 
Intelligence to the right Fulfilment thereof. It shall be a beacon to enlighten 
him, to comfort him, and to direct him; and it shall be a Witness and Memorial 
of my Word and of my Work, as of mine Attainment unto Wisdom. <br>

<p>There is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ with mine own Hand and 
Style, slowly and heedfully (as is contrary with my custom) being the Fruit of 
the Tree of my Mediation, well-ripened by the Sun of mine Illumination. With 
much Toil have I done this, being oftentimes seated without Motion save of the 
Hands, while Earth rolled from Twilight unto Twilight, so that my Body became 
cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse. Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, 
have I been given to Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably the Mass 
of the Holy Ghost, in the Concentration of my Will to impart this Wisdom unto 
thee, and to reveal the Mysteries of Truth. Now of all these this is the Root, 
that Truth is not fixed with the Rigour of Death, but vital with Lust of Change, 
and enflamed with the Love of its opposite. Thus even Falsehood is not alien to 
Truth, for the Perfection of Nature comprehendeth all. But all these Things are 
written in <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">The Book of the Law</font></i>, 
after which do I limp painfully, afar off, upon the poor Crutch of mine 
Understanding of its Word; yea, I am well assured that in that Book are writ all 
Things soever; but we, being mostly without Wit are not able to distinguish 
them. For the Stature of Aiwass is beyond our Measure, seeing that he was able 
to comprehend the whole Mystery of Nuit and of Hadit, and yet to declare Their 
Message in the Language of Men. <br>

Her Lord Hadit, for the Miracle of the Anatomy of the Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as it 
is shewn in the Design <i><font face="Century Schoolbook">Minutum Mundum</font></i>,

there is a Path to separate and to join them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, 
that is One indeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthography; to 
signify the Most Holy Trinity, and by Metathesis it is Thick Darkness, and 
Sudden Death. This is also the Number of <b><font size="-1" face="Verdana">A U M</font></b>,

Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit, that it may live; then do thou 
embrace it with Lust of they Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it; so shall 
ye be One Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and Ecstasy of this 
Consummation thou shalt with by what Inspiration thou didst choose thy Name in

This is the last Word of the Song that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for
