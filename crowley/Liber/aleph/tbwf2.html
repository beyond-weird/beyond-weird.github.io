<p>But concerning the Medium by whose sensitive Nature our Magick Force is 
transmitted to the Object of our Working, doubt not. For already in other 
Galaxies of Physics have we been compelled to postulate an Æthyr wholly 
hypothetical in order to explain the Phenomena of Light, Electricity, and the 
like; nor doeth any Man demand Demonstration of the Existence of that Æthyr 
other than its Conformity with general Law. Thou therefore, Creator and 
Transmitter of thine own Energy, needest not to ask whether by this or by some 
other Means thou performest thy Work. Yet I know not why this Æthyr of the 
Mathematicians and the Physicians should not be one with the Astral Light, or 
Plastic Medium or Aub, Aud, Aur (these three being a Trinity) of which our own 
Sages have spoken. And this Meditation may bring forth much Knowledge physical, 
which is good, for that which is above is like that which is beneath, and the 
Study of any Law leadeth to the Understanding of all Law. So mayst thou learn in 
the End that there is no Law beyond Do what thou wilt. </p>

<p>And how then (sayst thou) shall I reconcile this Art Magick with that Way of 
the Tao which achieveth all Things by doing nothing? But this have I already 
declared to thee in Part, showing that thou canst do no Magick save it be thy 
Nature to do Magick and so the true Nothing for thee. For to do nothing 
signifieth to interfere with nothing so that for a Magician to do no Magick is 
to commit Violence on himself. Yet learn also that all Action is in some sense 
Magick, being an essential Part of that Great Magical Work which we call Nature. 
Then thou hast no free Will? Verily, thou hast said. Yet nevertheless it is thy 
necessary Destiny to act with that free Will. Thou canst do nothing save in 
accordance with that true Nature of thine and of all Things, and every 
Phenomenon is the Resultant of the Totality of Forces; Amen. Then thou needest 
take no Thought and make no Effort? Thou sayst sooth; yet, art thou not 
compelled to Thought and Effort in the Way of Nature? Yea, I, thy Father, work 
for thee solicitously, and also I laugh at thy Perplexities; for so was it fore- 
ordained that I should do, by Me, from the Beginning. <br>

<p>So, therefore, o my Son, count thyself happy when thou understandest all 
these Things, being one of those Beings (or By-comings) whom we call 
Philosophers. All is a never ending Play of Love wherein our Lady Nuit and Her 
Lord Hadit rejoice; and every Part of the Play is Play. All pain is but sharp 
Sauce to the Dish of Pleasure; for it is the Nature of the Universe that hath 
devised this everlasting Banquet of Joy. And he that knoweth not this is 
necessary as an Ingredient even as thou art; wouldst thou change all and spoil 
the Dish? Art thou the Master-Cook? Yea, for thy Palate is become fine with thy 
great Dalliance with the Food of Experience; therefore thou art one of them that 
rejoice. Also it is thy Nature as it is mine, o my Son, to will that all Men 
share our Mirth and Jollity; wherefore have I proclaimed my Law to Man, and thou 
continuest in that Work of Joyaunce. <br>

<p>Learn also of my wisdom that this Vision of the Cosmos whereof I have written 
unto thee is not given unto thy Sight at all Times; for in that Vision is all 
Will fulfilled. Thou seest the Universe as None, and as One, and as many, and 
the Play thereof; and therewith art thou (who art no longer thou) content. For 
in one Phase art thou also None, in another One, and in the third an organised 
and necessary Part of that great Structure, so that there is no more conflict at 
all in thy whole By-coming. But now will I make Light for thine Eyes in this 
Matter as thou gropest, asking: but of them that see not this, what sayst thou, 
o my Father? But in that Vision thou sayst not thus, my Son! Learn then of me 
the Secret Mystery of Illusion, and how it Worketh, and other Holy Law that is 
its Nature, and of thine Action therein; for this is an Arcanum of the Wisdom of 
the Magi, and proper unto thee that dwellest in the Land of Understanding. <br>

<p>Consider for an Example the Game and Play of the Chess, which is a Pastime of 
Man, and worthy to exercise him in Thought, yet by no means necessary to his 
Life, so that he sweepeth away Board and Pieces at the least Summons of that 
which is truly dear to him. Thus unto him this Game is as it were an Illusion. 
But insofar as he entereth into the Game he abideth by the Rules thereof, though 
they be artificial and in no wise proper to his Nature; for in this Restriction 
is all his Pleasure. Therefore, though he hath All-Power to move the Pieces at 
his own Will, he doth it not, enduring Loss, Indignity, and Defeat rather than 
destroy that Artifice of Illusion. Think then that thou hast thyself created 
this Shadow-world the Universe, and that it pleasureth thee to watch or to 
actuate its Play according to the Law that thou hast made, which yet bindeth 
thee not save only by Virtue of thine own Will to do thine own Pleasure therein.

<p>Moreover this Matter touches the Nature of Truth. For although to thee in thy 
True Self, absolute and without Conditions, all this Universe, which is relative 
and conditioned is an Illusion; yet to that Part of Thee by which thou 
perceivest it, the Law of its Being (or By-coming) is a Law of Truth. Learn then 
that all Relations are true upon their own Plane, and that it would be a 
Violation of Nature to adjust them skewwise. Thus, albeit thou hast found thy 
Self, and knowest Thy Self immortal and immutable beyond Time and Space, free of 
Causality, so thoroughly that even thy Mind partaketh constantly thereof, thou 
hast in no wise altered the Relations of thy Body with its Syndromics in the 
World whereof it is a Part. Wouldst thou lengthen the Life of thy Body? Then 
accommodate thou the Conditions of thy Body to its Environment by giving it 
Light, Air, Food, and Exercise as its Nature requireth. So also, mutatis 
mutandis, do thou cherish the Health of thy Mind. <br>

<p>Of this will I speak further with thee, for here behold a great Rock of 
Ignorance on the one Hand, and on the other a Whirlpool of Error; in this Strait 
are many Wrecks of Magick Ships. Knowest thou not that Riddle of old, whether it 
be lawful to pay Tribute to Cæsar or no? Give therefore to the Body the Things 
of the Body, and to the Mind the Things of the Mind. Yet because of the interior 
Harmony of all Things that proceedeth from their Original One Nature, there is 
Action and Reaction of the one upon the other, as I have already set forth in 
this mine Epistle. But Law is universal, and between these two Kinds of Illusion 
there is an ordered Proportion, and it is proper to thy Science to delimit and 
describe this Law of Interaction, for to deny it wholly (as to extend it to 
Infinity) is Folly, born of Ignorance, Idleness, and Incapacity to observe Fact.

<p>Consider Drunkenness, how by Variation of bodily Conditions thou mayst alter 
its Effect upon the Mind, and the Contrary, remembering the Discipline of 
Theophrastus Paracelsus, how, opposing Wine to bodily Exercise, he obtained a 
certain Purification and Exaltation/ Yet, were he seven times greater, he had 
not done this with Oil of Vitriol. Learn then that there are certain definite 
Channels of Action and Reaction between Body and Mind; sound these, and trim thy 
Sails accordingly, not thinking that thou art in the open Sea. And if so be that 
thou in thy sounding findest new Channels, rejoice and map them for the Profit 
of thy Fellows; But remember always that to find a new Way up a Precipice 
removeth not the Precipice. For where thou, o Angel and yet Man, hast trod 
delicately albeit without Fear, Fools will rush in to their Destruction. <br>

<p>Study Logic, which is the Code of the Laws of Thought. Study the Method of 
Science, which is the Application of Logic to the Facts of the Universe. Think 
not that thou canst ever abrogate these Laws, for though they be Limitations, 
they are the rules of thy Game which thou dost play. For in thy Trances though 
thou becomest That which is not subject to those Laws, they are still final in 
respect of these Things which thou hast set them to govern. Nay, o my son, I 
like not this Word, govern, for a Law is but a Statement of the nature of the 
Thing to which it applieth. Nor nothing is compelled save only by Nature of its 
own true Will. So therefore human Law is a Statement of the Will and of the 
Nature of Man, or else it is a Falsity contrary thereunto, and becometh null and 
of no Effect. <br>

<p>Think also, o my Son, of this Image, that if two States be at Peace, a Man 
goeth between them without Let; but if there be War, all Gateways are forthwith 
closed, save only for a few, and these are watched and guarded, so that the 
Obstacles are many. This then is the Case of Magick; for if thou have brought to 
Harmony all Principles within thee, thou mayst work easily to transmute a Force 
into its semblable upon another Plane, which is the essential Miracle of our 
Art; but if thou be at War within thyself, how canst thou work? For our Master 
Hermes Tresmegistus hat written at the Head of His Tablet of Emerald this Word: 
That which is above is like that which is below, and that which is below is like 
that which is above, for the Performance of the Miracle of the One Substance. 
How then, if these be not alike? If the Substance of Thee be Two, and not One? 
And herein is the Need of the Confession of a pure Heart, as is written in the 
Book of the Dead. </p>
