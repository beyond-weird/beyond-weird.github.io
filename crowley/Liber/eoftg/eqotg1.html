                        The Boyhood of Aleister Crowley.</h4><hr>
<p>        
        At  36  Clarendon Square, Leamington, Warwickshire,  England,  at 
        10.50 p.m. on the twelfth day of October, in the Eighteen Hundred 
        and  Seventy-Fifth  Year of the vulgar era, was born  the  person 
        whose history is to be recounted.
<p>        
        His  father was named Edward Crowley;  his mother, Emily  Bertha, 
        her  maiden name being Bishop.  Edward Crowley was  an  Exclusive 
        Plymouth Brother, the most considered leader in that sect.   This 
        branch of the family of Crowley has been settled in England since 
        Tudor  times,  but is Celtic in origin, Crowley being a  clan  in 
        Kerry  and  other counties in the South-West of Ireland,  of  the 
        same  stock as the Breton `de Querouaille' or `de  Kerval'  which 
        gave a Duchess of Portsmouth to England.  It is supposed that the 
        English   branch---the  direct  ancestry  of   Edward   Alexander 
        Crowley---came  to  England with the Duke of Richmond,  and  took 
        root at Bosworth.
<p>        
        In  1881 he went to live at The Grange, Redhill, Surrey.  In  I884 
        the  boy,  who  had till then been educated  by  governesses  and 
        tutors,  was  sent  to a school at St.  Leonards,  kept  by  some 
        extreme  Evangelicals  named  Habershon.  A  year  later  he  was 
        transferred  to a school at Cambridge kept by a Plymouth  Brother 
        of  the  name  of Champney.  <em>(The dates  in  this  paragraph  are 
        possibly  inaccurate.   Documentary evidence is  at  the  present 
        moment unavailable.  Ed.)</em>
<p>        
        On  March 5, 1887, Edward Crowley died.  Two years later the  boy 
        was  removed  from  the school.  Those two years  were  years  of 
        unheard-of  torture.   He has written details in the  Preface  to 
        "The  World's  Tragedy."  This torture seriously  undermined  his 
        health.   For  two  years  he travelled,  mostly  in   Wales  and 
        Scotland,  with  tutors.  In 1890 he went for a short time  to  a 
        school  at  Streatham,  kept by a man named  Yarrow,  his  mother 
        having moved there in order to be near her brother, an  extremely 
        narrow  Evangelical named Tom Bond Bishop. This prepared him  for 
        Malvern,  which he entered at the summer term of 1891.   He  only 
        remained there a year, as his health was still very delicate.  In 
        the autumn he entered for a term at Tonbridge, but fell seriously 
        ill, and had to be removed.  The year 1893 was spent with tutors, 
        principally in Wales, the north of Scotland, and Eastbourne.   In 
        1895  he  completed his studies in chemistry at  King's  College, 
        London,  and  in October of that year  entered  Trinity  College, 
        Cambridge.
<p>        
        With  this  ends  the  first period of  his  life.   It  is  only 
        necessary  to state briefly that his brain developed  early.   At 
        four  years old he could read the Bible aloud, showing  a  marked 
        predilection  for the lists of long names, the only part  of  the 
        Bible   which has not been tampered with by  theologians. <em>(This 
        curious trait may perhaps be evidence of  his  poetical 
        feeling,  his passion for the bizarre and mysterious, or even  of 
        his aptitude for the Hebrew Qabalah.  It may also be  interpreted 
        as a clue to his magical ancestry.)</em> He 
        could  also play chess well enough to beat the  average  amateur, 
        and though constantly playing never lost a game till I895.<em>(The 
        first man to beat him was H. E. Atkins,  British  Chess 
        Champion (Amateur) for many years.)</em> He 
        was taught by a tailor who had been summoned to make clothes  for 
        his father, and was treated as a guest on account of his being  a 
        fellow  "Plymouth Brother".  He beat his teacher uniformly  after 
        the first game.  He must have been six or seven years old at this 
        time.
<p>        
        He  began  to  write  poetry  in  1886,  if  not  earlier.   Vide 
        "Oracles".
<p>        
        After  the  death of his father, who was a man of  strong  common 
        sense,  and never allowed his religion to interfere with  natural 
        affection, he was in the hands of people of an entirely  contrary 
        disposition.  His mental attitude was soon concentrated in hatred 
        of  the religion which they taught, and his will concentrated  in 
        revolt  against its oppressions.  His main method of  relief  was 
        mountaineering,  which left him alone with nature, away from  the 
        tyrants.
<p>        
        The  years  from  March, 1887, until  entering  Trinity  College, 
        Cambridge,  in  October, 1895, represented a  continual  struggle 
        towards  freedom.   At Cambridge he felt himself to  be  his  own 
        master,  refused  to  attend Chapel, Lectures or  Hall,  and  was 
        wisely left alone to work out his won salvation by his tutor, the 
        late Dr. A. W. Verrall.
<p>        
        It must be stated that he possessed natural intellectual  ability 
        to  an  altogether extraordinary degree.  He had the  faculty  of 
        memory, especially verbal memory, in astonishing perfection.
<p>        
        As a  boy he could find almost any verse in the Bible after a few 
        minutes  search.   In  1900  he  was  tested  in  the  works   of 
        Shakespeare,   Shelley,  Swinburne  (1st  series  of  Poems   and 
        Ballads),  Browning  and  The Moonstone.  He was  able  to  place 
        exactly  any phrase from any of these books, and in nearly  every 
        case to continue with the passage.
<p>        
        He showed remarkable facility in acquiring the elements of Latin, 
        Greek,  French,  Mathematics  and  Science.   He  learnt  "little 
        Roscoe"  almost  by heart, on his won initiative.   When  in  the 
        Lower  Fifth at Malvern, he came out sixth in the school  in  the 
        annual Shakespeare examination, though he had given only two days 
        to preparing for it.  Once, when the Mathematical Master, wishing 
        to devote the hour to cramming advanced pupils, told the class  to 
        work out a set of examples of Quadratic Equations, he retorted by 
        asking  at the end of forty minutes what he should do  next,  and 
        handed up the whole series of 63 equations, correct.
<p>        
        He passed all his examinations both at school and university
        with honours, though refusing uniformly to work for them.
<p>        
        On  the other hand, he could not be persuaded or  constrained  to 
        apply  himself  to any subject which did not appeal to  him.   He 
        showed  intense  repugnance to history,  geography,  and  botany, 
        among  others.   He could never learn to write  Greek  and  Latin 
        verses,  this  probably  because the  rules  of  scansion  seemed 
        arbitrary and formal.
<p>        
        Again, it was impossible to him to take interest in anything from 
        the moment that he had grasped the principles of "how it was,  or 
        might  be  done."   This trait prevented  him  from  putting  the 
        finishing touches to anything he attempted.
<p>        
        For  instance, he refused to present himself for the second  part 
        of his final examination for his B.A. degree, simply because
        he knew himself thoroughly master of the subject! <em>(Swinburne  similarly refused to be examined in  Classics  at 
        Oxford on the ground that he knew more than the examiners.)</em>
<p>
        This  characteristic extended to his physical pleasures.  He  was 
        abjectly  incompetent  at  easy practice  climbing  on  boulders, 
        because  he knew he could do them.  It seemed incredible  to  the 
        other  men  that this lazy duffer should be the most  daring  and 
        dexterous  cragsman  of  his generation,  as  he  proved  himself 
        whenever  he  tackled a precipice which had baffled  every  other 
        climber in the world.  <em>(In Chess also he has beaten many International Masters,  and 
        ranks on the Continent as a Minor Master himself.  But he  cannot 
        be  relied  upon to win against a second-rate player  in  a  Club 
        Match.)</em>  Similarly, once he had worked out theoretically  a method of climbing a mountain, he was quite  content 
        to tell the secret to others, and let them appropriate the glory.  
        (The  first ascent of the Dent du Geant from the Montanvers is  a 
        case  in  point.)  It mattered everything to him  that  something 
        should be done, nothing that he should be the one to do it.
<p>        
        This  almost  inhuman  unselfishness was  not  incompatible  with 
        consuming  and  insatiable  personal ambition.  The  key  to  the 
        puzzle  is probably this; he wanted to be something that  nobody 
        else  had ever been, or could be.  He lost interest in  chess  as 
        soon as he had proved to himself (at the age of 22) that he was a 
        master of the game, having beaten some of the strongest  amateurs 
        in  England,  and  even one or two  professional  "masters."   He 
        turned from poetry to painting, more or less, when he had made it 
        quite certain that he was the greatest poet of his time.  Even in 
        Magick,  having become The Word of the Aeon, and thus  taken  his 
        place with the other Seven Magi known to history, out of reach of 
        all possible competition, he began to neglect the subject.  He is 
        only  able  to  devote himself to it as he does  because  he  has 
        eliminated  all personal ideas from his Work ; it has  become  as 
        automatic as respiration.
<p>        
        We   must also put on record his extraordinary powers in  certain 
        unusual spheres.  He can remember the minutest details of a rock-
        climb, after years of absence.  He can retrace his steps over any 
        path  once  traversed,  in the wildest weathee  or  the  blackest 
        night.   He can divine the one possible passagr through the  most 
        complex and dangerous ice-fall.  (E.g. the Vuibez seraes in I897, 
        the Mer de Glace, right centre, in I899.)
<p>        
        He  possesses  a "sense of direction" independent  of  any  known 
        physical methods of taking one's bearings; and this is as effective in strange cities as on mountains or deserts.  He can  smell 
        the  presence of water, of snow, and other  supposedly  scentless 
        substances.  His endurance is exceptional.  He has been known  to 
        write  for  67  consecutive hours :  his  "Tannhauser"  was  thus 
        written in 1900.  He has walked over 100 miles in 2 1/2 days,  in 
        the  desert :  as in the winter of 1910.  He has frequently  made 
        expeditions  lasting  over 36 hours, on mountains,  in  the  most 
        adverse connditions.  He holds the World's record for the  greatest 
        number of days spent on a glacier--65 days on the Baltoro  in 
        1902;  also  that  for  the  greatest  pace  uphill  over  16,000 
        feet--4,000  feet in 1 hour 23 minutes on Iztaccihuatl  in  1900; 
        that   for  the  highest  peak   (first  ascent  by  a   solitary 
        climber)--the Nevado de Toluca in 1901; and numerous others.  
        <em>(Written in 1920 e.v.: these records may no longer stand.)</em>
<p>
        Yet he is utterly fagged-out by the mere idea of a walk of a  few 
        hundred  yards,  if  it does not interest  him,  and  excite  his 
        imagination, to take it; and it is only with the greatest effort 
        that he can summon the energy to write a few lines if, instead of 
        his wanting  to do them, he merely knows that they must be done.
<p>        
        This account has been deemed necessary to explain how it is  that 
        a  man of such unimaginable commanding qualities as to have  made 
        him  world-famous  in so many diverse spheres of  action,  should 
        have been so grotesquely unable to make use of his faculties,  or 
        even  of  his achievements, in any of the  ordinary  channels  of 
        human activity; to consolidate his personal pre-eminence, or even 
        to secure his position from a social or economic standpoint.
