        Having  won  freedom, he had the sense not to waste any  time  in 
        enjoying it.  He had been deprived of all English literature  but 
        the  Bible during the whole of his youth, and he spent his  three 
        years at Cambridge in repairing the defect.  He was also  working 
        for the Diplomatic Service, the late Lord Salisbury and the  late 
        Lord  Ritchie having taken an interest in his career,  and  given 
        him  nominations.  In October, 1897, he was suddenly recalled  to 
        his   understanding  of  the  evils  of  the  alleged   'existing 
        religion,'  and experienced a trance, in which he  perceived  the 
        utter  folly  of all human ambition.  The fame of  an  ambassador 
        rarely  outlives  a  century.   That  of  a  poet  is  almost  as 
        ephemeral.  The earth must one day perish.  He must build in some 
        material more lasting.  This conception drove him to the study of 
        Alchemy and Magick.  He wrote to the author of "The Book of Black 
        Magic  and  of  Pacts," a pompous American  named  Arthur  Waite, 
        notorious for the affectations and obscurities of his style,  and 
        the  mealy-mouthed  muddle  of  his  mysticism.   This   nebulous 
        impresario,  presentin  an  asthmatic Isis in  the  Opera  
       "Bull-Frogs,"  had  hinted in his preface that he knew  certain  occult 
        sanctuaries wherein Truth and Wisdom were jealously guarded by  a 
        body  of Initiates, to be despensed to the postulant  who  proved 
        himself  worthy  to  partake  of  their  privileges.   Mr.  Waite 
        recommended  him  to  read  a  book  called  "The  Cloud  on  the 
        Sanctuary."

        His  taste for mountaineering had become a powerful passion,  and 
        he  was  climbing  in Cumberland when he  met  Oscar  Eckenstein, 
        perhaps the greatest of all the mountaineers of his period,  with 
        whom he was destined to climb thenceforward until 1902.
<p>        
        In the summer a party was fromed to camp on the Schonbuhl Glacier 
        at the foot of the Dent Blanche, with a view to an expedition  ot 
        the  Himalayas later on.  During his weeks on the Glacier,  where 
        the  bad  weather  was  continous,  he  studied  assiduously  the 
        translation  by S. L. Mathers of three books which form  part  of 
        von  Rosenroth's "Kabbalah Unveiled."  On one of his  decents  to 
        Zermatt, he met a distinguished chemist, Julian L. Bater, who had 
        studied  Alchemy.   He hunted this clue through the  valley,  and 
        made  Baker promise to meet him in London at the end of the  sea-
        son,  and introduce him to others who were interested  in  Occult 
        science.   This  happened in September; through  Baker,  he  met 
        another  chemist named George Cecil Jones, who introduced him  to 
        the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.  He made rapid progress in 
        this  Order, and in the spring of 1900 was its chief in  England.  
        The  details  of this period must be studied in  "The  Temple  of 
        Solomon  the King," where a full account of the Order  is  given.  
        In the Order he met one, Allan Bennett, Frater Iehi Aour.   Jones 
        and  Bennett were both Adepts of high standing.  The latter  came 
        to live with him in his flat, and together they carried out  many 
        operations  of  ceremonial magick.  Allan  Bennett  was  constant 
        illhealth, and went to Ceylon at the end of 1899.  It was on  his 
        entry  into this Order that the subject of this history took  the 
        motto of "Perdurabo"--'I will endure to the end.'
<p>        
        In  July, 1900, he went to Mexico, and devoted his whole time  to 
        the   continued  practice  of  Magick,  in  which   he   obtained 
        extraordinary  success.   (See  Equinox Vol. I,  No.  III  for  a 
        condensed  account  of  some of these.  It  may  be  here  stated 
        summarily that he invoked certain Gods, Goddesses, and Spirits to 
        visible  appearance,  learnt  how  to  heal  physical  and  moral 
        diseases,   how  to  make  himself  invisible,  how   to   obtain 
        communications  from  spiritual  sources, how  to  control  other 
        minds, etc., etc.)  And then....
