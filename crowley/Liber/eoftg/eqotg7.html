<blockquote>        
                    Remarks on the method of receiving Liber Legis, on 
                    the Conditions prevailing at the time of the writing,
                    and on certain technical difficulties connected with 
                    the Literary form of the Book.
</blockquote>        </h4><em>This  paper was written, independently of any  idea  of  its 
        present  place  in this Book, by The Beast 666  Himself,  in  the 
        Abbey  of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily.  No further apology  is  
offered  for any repetitious of statements made in  previous  chapters.

</center>        
             Certain  very serious questions have arisen with  regard  to 
        the  method by which this Book was obtained.  I do not  refer  to 
        those  doubts --real or pretended --which hostility engenders,  for 
        all  such  are dispelled by study of the text; no  forger  could 
        have  prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal  puzzles 
        as to leave himself (a) devoted to the solution for years  after, 
        (b)  baffled  by  a simplicity which when  desclosed  leaves  one 
        gasping  at its profundity, (c) enlightened only  by  progressive 
        initiation,  or  by "accidental" events  apparently  disconnected 
        with  the  Book, which occurred long after its  publication,  (d) 
        hostile, bewildered, and careless even in the face of independent 
        testimony  as  to the power and clarity of the Book, and  of  the 
        fact  that  by  Its light other men have  attained  the  loftiest 
        summits  of initiation in a tithe of the time which  history  and 
        experience would lead one to expect, and (e) angrily unwilling to 
        proceed  with  that part of the Work appointed for him  which  is 
        detailed  in Chapter III, even when the course of events  on  the 
        planet,  war,  revolution,  and the collapse of  the  social  and 
        religious  systems  of civilization, proved plainly to  him  that 
        whether  he liked it or no, Ra Hoor Khuit was indeed Lord of  the 
        Aeon,  the Crowned and Conquering Child whose innocence meant  no 
        more than inhuman cruelty and wantonly senseless  destructiveness 
        as  he avenged Isis our mother the Earth and the Heaven  for  the 
        murder and mutilation of Osiris, Man, her son.  The War of  1914-18
        and  its sequels have proved even to the  dullest  statesmen, 
        beyond  wit  of even the most subtly sophistical  theologians  to 
        gloze,  that  death  is  not an unmixed  benefit  either  to  the 
        individual  or  the community :  that force and fire  of  leaping 
        manhood are more useful to a nation than cringing  respectability 
        and emasculate servility; that genius goes with courage, and  the 
        sense of shame and guilt with "Defeatism."
<p>        
        For these reasons and many more I am certain, I the Beast,  whose 
        number  is Six Hundred and Sixty Six, that this Third Chapter  of 
        the Book of the Law is nothing less than the authentic Word,  the 
        Word of the Aeon, the Truth about Nature at this time and on this 
        planet.  I wrote it, hating it and sneering at it, secretly  glad 
        that  I  could use it to revolt against this Task  most  terrible 
        that the Gods have thrust remorselessly upon my shoulders,  their 
        Cross of burning steel that I must carry even to my Calvary,  the 
        place of a skull, there to be eased of its weight only that I  be 
        crucified  thereon.  But, being lifted up, I will draw the  whole 
        world  unto me; and men shall worship me the Beast, Six  Hundred 
        and  Three-score and Six, celebrating to Me their  Midnight  Mass 
        every time soever when they do that they will, and on Mine  altar 
        slaying to Me that victim I most relish, their Selves; when Love 
        designs  and Will executes the Rite whereby (an they know  it  or 
        not) their God in man is offered to me The Beast, their God,  the 
        Rite  whose  virtue,  making their God of  their  throned  Beast, 
        leaves nothing, howso bestial, undivine.
<p>        
        On  such lines my own "conversion" to my own "religion" may  take 
        place,  though  as I write these words all but  twelve  weeks  of 
        Sixteen years are well nigh past. <em>(Written in I920, e.v.)</em>
<p>        
        
<hr><h2><center>                                II</center></h2>
        
        This long digression is but to explain that I, myself, who  issue 
        Liber Legis, am no fanatic partisan.  I will obey my orders (III, 
        42)  "Argue not, convert not;" even though I shirk some  others.  
        I shall not deign to answer sceptical enquiries as to the  origin 
        of  the  Book.  "Success is your proof."  I, of all men  on  this 
        Earth  reputed mightiest in Magick, by mine enemies more than  by 
        my  friends, have striven to lose this Book, to forget  it,  defy 
        it,  criticise it, escape it, these nigh sixteen years;  and  It 
        holds me to the course It sets, even as the Mountain of Lodestone 
        holds  the  ship,  or  Helios by  invisible  bonds  controls  his 
        planets;  yea, or as BABALON grips between her thighs  the  Great 
        Wild Beast she straddles!
<p>        
        So  much for the sceptics; put your heads in the Lion's mouth; 
        so may you come to certainty, whether I be stuffed with straw!
<p>        
        But, in the text of the Book itself, are thorns for the flesh  of 
        the most ardent swain as he buries his face in the roses; some of 
        the  ivy that clings about the Thyrse of this Dionysus is  Poison 
        Ivy.   The question arises, especially on examining the  original 
        manuscript in My handwriting:  "Who wrote these words?"
<p>        
        Of course I wrote them, ink on paper, in the material sense;  but 
        they  are not My words, unless Aiwaz be taken to be no more  than 
        my  subconscious  self, or some part of it:  in  that  case,  my 
        conscious  self  being  ignorant of the Truth  in  the  Book  and 
        hostile  to most of the ethics and philosophy of the Book,  Aiwaz 
        is a severely suppressed part of me. Such  a  theory would further 
        imply that I  am,  unknown  to 
        myself,  possessed of all sorts of praeternatural  knowledge  and 
        power.  The law of Parsimony of Thought (Sir W. Hamilton) appears 
        in  rebuttal.   Aiwaz calls Himself "the minister  of  Hoor-parr-
        Kraat," the twin of Heru-Ra-Ha.  This is the dual form of  Horus, 
        child of Isis and Osiris.
  If so, the theorist must 
        suggest  a reason for this explosive yet ceremonially  controlled 
        manifestation, and furnish and explanation of the dovetailing  of 
        Events  in subsequent years with His word written and  published.  
        In  any  case, whatever "Aiwaz" is, "Aiwaz"  is  an  Intelligence 
        possessed   of  power  and  knowledge  absolutely  beyond   human 
        experience;  and  therefore Aiwaz is a  Being  worthy,  as  the 
        current use of the word allows, of the title of a God, yea verily 
        and  amen,  of a God.  Man has no such fact  recorded,  by  proof 
        established  in surety beyond cavil of critic, as this  Book,  to 
        witness  the  existence  of  and  Intelligence  praeterhuman  and 
        articulate, purposefully interfering in the philosophy, religion, 
        ethics, economics and politics of the Planet.
<p>        
        The  proof of His praeterhuman Nature --call Him a Devil or a  God 
        or  even an Elemental as you will --is partly external,  depending 
        on events and persons without the sphere of Its influence, partly 
        internal,  depending  on the concealment of (a)  certain  Truths, 
        some  previously  known, some not known, but for  the  most  part 
        beyond  the  scope of my mind at the time of writing, (b)  of  an 
        harmony  of letters and numbers subtle, delicate and  exact,  and 
        (c)  of  Keys to all life's mysteries, both pertinent  to  occult 
        science  and  otherwise, and to all the Locks of  Thought;  the 
        concealment of these three galaxies of glory, I say, in a  cipher 
        simple  and luminous, but yet illegible for over Fourteen  years, 
        and  translated even then not by me, but by my  mysterious  Child 
        according  to  the Foreknowledge written in the Book  itself,  in 
        terms  so complex that the exact fulfilment of the conditions  of 
        His  birth,  which  occurred with  incredible  precision,  seemed 
        beyond  all possibility, a cipher involving  higher  mathematics, 
        and a knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek and Arabic Qabalahs as  well 
        as the True Lost Word of the Freemason, is yet veiled within  the 
        casual  silk-stuff  of ordinary English words, nay, even  in  the 
        apparently  accidental  circumstance  of the  characters  of  the 
        haste-harried scrawl of My pen.
<p>
        Many  such cases of double entendre, paranomasia in one  language 
        or  another,  sometimes two at once,  numerical-literal  puzzles, 
        and  even (on one occasion) an illuminating connexion of  letters 
        in  various  lines by a slashing scratch, will be  found  in  the 
        Qabalistic section of the Commentary. <em>(In preparation.)</em>
<p>        
<hr><h2><center>        
                                  III</center></h2>
        
        As an example of the first method above mentioned, we have,  Cap. 
        III,  "The fool readeth this Book--and he understandeth it  not."  
        This has a secret reverse-sense, meaning:  
<p>        
        The fool (Parzival = Fra. O.I.V.V.I.O.) understandeth it (being a 
        Magister Templi, the Grade attributed to Understanding) not (i.e. 
        to be `not').
<p>        
        This Parzival, adding to 418, is (in the legend of the Graal) the 
        son  of Kamuret, adding to 666, being the son of me The Beast  by 
        the  Scarlet Woman Hilarion.  This was a Name chosen by her  when 
        half  drunk, as a theft from Theosophical legend, but  containing 
        many  of our letter-number Keys to the Mysteries ; the number  of 
        the petals in the most sacred lotus.  It adds to 1001, which also 
        is  Seven times Eleven times Thirteen, a series of factors  which 
        may  be  read  as The Scarlet Woman's Love  by  Magick  producing 
        Unity,  in Hebrew Achad.  For 7 is the number of Venus,  and  the 
        secret  seven-lettered  Name  of my concubine B A B A L  O  N  is 
        written with Seven Sevens, thus: 
<blockquote>        
          77 + ((7+7)/7) + 77 = 156, the number of BABALON.
</blockquote>        
        418  is  the number of the Word of the Magical  Formula  of  this 
        Aeon.  (666 is I, The Beast.)
<p>        
        Parzival  had also the name Achad as a Neophyte of A.A.,  and  it 
        was  Achad whom Hilarion bare to Me.  And Achad means Unity,  and 
        the  letter  of  Unity is Aleph, the letter of The  Fool  in  the 
        Tarot.  Now this Fool invoked the Magical Formula of the Aeon  by 
        taking as his Magick, or True, Name one which added also to 418.
<p>        
        He  took  it  for  his  Name on  Entering  the  Gnosis  where  is 
        Understanding, and he understood it--this Book--not.  That is, he 
        understood  that  this Book was, so to speak, a vesture  or  veil 
        upon  the  idea of "not."  In Hebrew "not" is LA, 31, and  AL  is 
        God,  31, while there is a third 31 still deeplier hidden in  the 
        double  letter ST, which is a graphic glyph of the sun  and  moon 
        conjoined  to  look  like  a  foreshortened  Phallus,  thus--when 
        written  in Greek capitals.  This S or Sigma is like  a  phallus, 
        thus, [Greek],  when  writ  small ;  and  like  a  serpent  or 
        spermatozoon when writ final, thus, [Greek].  This T or Theta  is 
        the  point in the circle, or phallus in the kteis, and  also  the 
        Sun just as C is the Moon, male and female.
  <p>      
        But  Sigma in Hebrew is Shin, 300, the letter of Fire and of  the 
        "Spirit  of the Gods" which broods upon the Formless Void in  the 
        Beginning,  being  by  shape a triple tongue  of  flame,  and  by 
        meaning  a tooth, which is the only part of the secret and  solid 
        foundation  of Man that is manifested normally.  Teeth serve  him 
        to fight, to crush, to cut, to rend, to bite and grip his prey; 
        they  witness  that he is a fierce,  dangerous,  and  carnivorous 
        animal.   But  they are also the best witness to the  mastery  of 
        Spirit over Matter, the extreme hardness of their substance being 
        chiselled and polished and covered with a glistening film by Lefe 
        no  less easily and beautifully than is does with more  naturally 
        plastic types of substance.
<p>        
        Teeth  are displayed when our Secret Self --our Subconscious  Ego, 
        whose Magical Image is our individuality expressed in mental  and 
        bodily  form --our Holy Guardian Angel --comes forth  and  declares 
        our  True Will to our fellows, whether to snarl or to  sneer,  to 
        smile or to laugh.
<p>        
        Teeth  serve  us to pronounce the dental letters which  in  their 
        deepest  nature express decision, fortitude, endurance,  just  as 
        gutturals  suggest  the breath of Life itself  free-flowing,  and 
        labials the duplex vibrations of action and reaction.   Pronounce 
        T,D,S  or  N, and you will find them  all  continuously  forcible 
        exhalations whose difference is determined solely by the position 
        of  the tongue, the teeth being bared as when a wild beast  turns 
        to  bay.  The sibilant sound of S or Sh is our English word,  and 
        also the Hebrew word, Hush, a strongly aspirated S, and  suggests 
        the  hiss  of  a  snake.  Now this hiss is  the  common  sign  of 
        recognition  between  men  when  one  wants  to  call   another's 
        attention  without  disturbing the silence more  than  necessary.  
        (Also  we  have  Hist, our Double letter.)   This  hiss  means: 
        "Attention!  A  man!"  For in  all  Semitic  and  some  Aryan 
        languages, ISh or a closely similar word means "a man."  Say  it: 
        you  must  bare your clenched teeth as in defiance,  and  breathe 
        harshly out as in excitement.
<p>        
        Hiss! Sh! means "Keep silent! there's danger if you are heard.  
        Attention!  There's a man somewhere, deadly as a snake.  Breathe 
        hard; there's a fight coming."
<p>        
        This  Sh  is then the forcible subtle creative  Spirit  of  Life, 
        fiery  and  triplex, continous, Silence of pure  Breath  modified 
        into  sound  by two and thirty obstacles, as the  Zero  of  Empty 
        Space, though it contain all Life, only takes form according  (as 
        the  Qabalists say) to the two  and thirty "Paths" of Number  and 
        Letter which obstruct it.
<p>        
        Now the other letter, Theta or Teth, has the value of Nine, which 
        is  that of AVB, the Secret Magick of Obeah, and of  the  Sephira 
        Yesod,  which is the seat in man of the sexual function by  whose 
        Magick  he overcomes even Death, and that in more ways than  one, 
        ways  that  are known to none but the loftiest and  most  upright 
        Initiates, baptised by the Baptism of Wisdom, and communicants at 
        that  Eucharist  where the Fragment of the Host  in  the  Chalice 
        becomes whole. <em>(The Chalice is not presented to laymen.  Those who understand 
        the reason for this and other details of the Mass, will wonder at 
        the  perfection with which the Roman Communion has preserved  the 
        form,  and lost the substance, of the Supreme Magical  Ritual  of 
        the True Gnosis.)</em>
<p>
        This T is the letter of Leo, the Lion, the house of heaven sacred 
        to the Sun.  (Thus also we find in it the number 6, whence  666).  
        And  Teth means a Serpent, the symbol of the magical Life of  the 
        Soul,  lord of "the double wand" of life and death.  The  serpent 
        is  royal, hooded, wise, silent save for an hiss when need is  to 
        disclose his Will; he devours his tail --the glyph of  Eternity, 
        of  Nothingness and of Space; he moves wavelike, one  immaterial 
        essence  travelling  through crest and trough, as  a  man's  soul 
        through  lives  and deaths.  He straightens out; he is  the  Rod 
        that strikes, the Light-radiance of the Sun or the Life  radiance 
        of the Phallus.
<p>        
        The  sound  of  T is tenuous and sharply final;  it  suggests  a 
        spontaneous  act sudden and irrevocable, like the  snake's  bite, 
        the loin's snap, the Sun's stroke, and the Lingam's.
<p>        
        Now  in the Tarot the Trump illustrating this letter Sh   is  and 
        old  form of the Stele of Revealing, Nuith with Shu and Seb,  the 
        pantacle  or magical picture of the old Aeon, as Nuit with  Hadit 
        and Ra Hoor Khuit is of the new.  The number of this Trump is XX.  
        It  is  called the Angel, the messenger from Heaven  of  the  new 
        Word.  The Trump giving the picture of T is called Strength.   It 
        shows  the Scarlet Woman, BABALON, riding (or conjoined with)  me 
        The Beast ; and this card is my special card, for I am  Baphomet, 
        "the  Lion  and the Serpent," and 666, the "full number"  of  the 
        Sun. <em>(The "magical numbers" of the Sun are, according to tradition, 
        6, (6 x 6)=36, (666 / 111, and [epsilon] (1-36)=666.)</em>
<p>        
        So then, as Sh, XX, shows the Gods of the Book of the Law and  T, 
        XI, shows the human beings in that Book, me and my concubine, the 
        two cards illustrate the whole Book in pictorial form.
<p>        
        Now  XX + XI = XXXI, 31, which we needed to put with LA,  31  and 
        AL,  31,  that we might have 31 x 3 = 93, the Word  of  the  Law, 
        THELEMA  [in greek], Will, and help, Love which under  Will,  is 
        the Law.  It is also the number of Aiwaz, the Author of the Book, 
        of the Lost Word whose formula does in sober truth "raise Hiram," 
        and of many another close-woven Word of Truth.
<p>        
        Now then this Two-in-One letter [sun, moon], is the third Key  to 
        this  Law; and on the discovery of that fact,  after  years  of 
        constant  seeking,  what sudden splendours of  Truth,  sacred  as 
        secret, blazed in the midnight of my mind.!  Observe now:  "this 
        circle squared in its failure is a key also."  Now I knew that in 
        the  value  of  the letters of ALHIM, "the Gods,"  the  Jews  had 
        concealed  a  not  quite correct value of [pi], the  ratio  of  a 
        circle's circumference to its diameter, to 4 places of decimals: 
        3.1415;  nearer  would be 3.1416.  If I  prefix  our  Key,  31, 
        putting  [sun,  moon], Set or Satan, before the old Gods,  I  get 
        3.141593, [pi] correct to Six places, Six being my own number and 
        that of Horus the Sun.  And the whole number of this new Name  is 
        395,  which  on  analysis yields  and  astounding  cluster  of 
        numerical "mysteries."  <em>(Shin 300 Teth 9 Aleph 1 Lamed 30 He 5 Yod 10 Mem  40.   Note 
        that  395 being the corrections required!  Note also the 31  and 
        the 93 in this value of [pi].)</em>
<p>
        Now  for  an example of the `paronomasia' or pun.   Chapter  III, 
        17---"Ye,  even  ye, know not this meaning all."  (Note  how  the 
        peculiar grammar suggests a hidden meaning.)  Now YE is in Hebrew 
        Yod  He, the man and the woman; The Beast and BABALON, whom  the 
        God was addressing in his verse.  Know suggests `no' which  gives 
        LA,  31; `not' is LA, 31, again, by actual meaning;  and  `all' 
        refers to AL, 31, again.  (Again, ALL is 61, AIN, "nothing.")

        Then  we  have  numerical problems like this.   "Six  and  fifty.  
        Divide,  add, multiply and understand."  6 / 50  gives 
        0.12, a perfect glyph-statement of the metaphysics of the Book.
<p>        
        The  external evidence for the Book is accumulating yearly:  the 
        incidents  connected with the discovery of the true  spelling  of 
        Aiwaz are alone sufficient to place it beyond all quaver of doubt 
        that I am really in touch with a Being of intelligence and  power 
        immensely subtler and greater than aught we can call human.
<p>        
        This has been the One Fundamental Question of Religion.  We  know 
        of   invisible  powers,  and  to  spare!   But  is  there   any 
        Intelligence or Individuality (of the same general type as  ours) 
        independent of our human brain-structure?  For the first time in 
        history,  yes!  Aiwaz has given us proof: the  most  important 
        gate toward Knowledge suings wide.
<p>        
        I, Aleister Crowley, declare upon my honour as a gentleman that I 
        hold  this  revelation a million times more  important  than  the 
        discovery  of  the  Wheel,  or even of the  Laws  of  Physics  or 
        Mathematics.   Fire  and Tools made Man master of  his  planet:  
        Writing  developed his mind; but his Soul was a guess until  the 
        Book of the Law proved this.
<p>        
        I,  a  master of English, was made to take down in  three  hours, 
        from  dictation,  sixty-five  8" x I0" pages of  words  not  only 
        strange,  but often displeasing to me in themselves;  concealing 
        in  cipher  propositions unknown to me, majestic and  profound; 
        foretelling events public and private beyond my control, or  that 
        of any man.
<p>        
        This  Book  proves: there is a Person thinking and acting  in  a 
        praeterhuman manner, either without a body of flesh, or with  the 
        power  of communicating telepathically with men  and  inscrutably 
        directing their actions.

        I  write this therefore with a sense of responsibility  so  acute 
        that  for the first time in my life I regret my sense  of  humour 
        and  the  literary  practical jokes which it  has  caused  me  to 
        perpetrate.   I am glad, though, that care was taken of  the  MS. 
        itself  and  of diaries and letters of the period,  so  that  the 
        physical facts are as plain as can be desired.
<p>
        My  sincerity  and  seriousness are proved by my  life.   I  have 
        fought  this  Book  and fled it; I have defiled it  and  I  have 
        suffered for its sake.  Present or absent to my mind, it has been 
        my Invisible Ruler.  It has overcome me; year after year extends 
        its  invasion of my being.  I am the captive of the  Crowned  and 
        Conquering Child.
<p>        
        The  point then arises: How did the Book of the Law come  to  be 
        written?  The description in The Equinox, I, VII, might well  be 
        more  detailed; and I might also elucidate the problem  of  the 
        apparent  changes  of  speaker, and the  occasional  lapses  from 
        straightforward scribecraft in the MS.
<p>        
        I  may observe that I should not have left such  obvious  grounds 
        for indictment as these had I prepared the MS. to look pretty  to 
        a critical eye; nor should I have left such curious  deformities 
        of  grammar  and syntax, defects of rhythm,  and  awkwardness  of 
        phrase.   I should not have printed passages, some  rambling  and 
        unintelligible,  some  repugnant to reason  by  their  absurdity, 
        others  again by their barbaric ferocity abhorrent to  heart.   I 
        should not have allowed such jumbles of matter, such abrupt jerks 
        from   subject   to  subject,  disorder  ravaging   reason   with 
        disconnected  sluttishness.   I  should not  have  tolerated  the 
        discords,  jarred  and  jagged,  of manner,  as  when  a  sublime 
        panegyric  of Death is followed first by a cipher and then  by  a 
        prophecy, before, without taking breath, the author leaps to  the 
        utmost  magnificence of thought both mystical and  practical,  in 
        language  so concise, simple, and lyrical as to bemuse  our  very 
        amazement.  I should not have spelt "Ay" "Aye," or acquiesced  in 
        the horror "abstruction."
<p>        
        Compare  with this Book my "jokes," where I pretend to  edit  the 
        MS.  of  another:  "Alice," "Amphora,"  "Clouds  without  Water."  
        Observe in each case the technical perfection of the "discovered" 
        or  "translated" MS., smooth skilled elaborte art and craft of  a 
        Past  Master  Workman; observe the carefully detailed  tone  and 
        style  of  the  prefaces,  and  the  sedulous  creation  of   the 
        personalities of the imaginary author and the imaginary editor.
<p>        
        Note,  moreover, with what greedy vanity I claim authorship  even 
        of  all  the  other A.'.A.'. Books in Class A, though  I  wrote  them 
        inspired  beyond  all  I know to be I.  Yet in  these  Books  did 
        Aleister  Crowley,  the master of English both in  prose  and  in 
        verse, partake insofar as he was That.  Compare those Books  with 
        the  Book  of the Law!  Their style is simple and sublime;  the 
        imagery  is  gorgeous and faultless; the rhythm  is  subtle  and 
        intoxicating; the theme is interpreted in  faultless  symphony.  
        There are no errors of grammar, no infelicities of phrase.   Each 
        Book is perfect in its kind.
<p>        
        I, daring to snatch credit for these, in that brutal Index to The 
        Equinox Volume One, dared nowise to lay claim to have touched the 
        Book of the Law, not with my littlest finger-tip.
<p>        
        I, boasting of my many Books; I, swearing each a masterpiece;  I 
        attach the Book of the Law at a dozen points of literature.  Even 
        so, with the dame breath, I testify, as a Master of English, that 
        I am utterly incapable, even when most inspired, fo such  English 
        as I find in that Book again and again.
<p>        
        Terse,  yet sublime, are these verses of this Book;  subtle  yet 
        simple;  matchless for rhythm, direct as a ray of  light.   Its 
        imagery  is  gorgeous without decadence.  It deals  with  primary 
        ideas.  It announces revolutions in philosophy, religion, ethics, 
        yea, in the whole nature of Man.  For this it needs no more  than 
        to  roll sea-billows solemnly forth, eight words, as  "Every  man 
        and every woman is a star," or it bursts in a mountain torrent of 
        monosyllables  as  "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole  of  the 
        Law."
<p>        
        Nuit cries: "I love you," like a lover; when even John reached 
        only to the cold impersonal proposition "God is love."  She  woos 
        like  a msitress; whispers "To me !" in every ear; Jesus,  with 
        needless  verb, appeals vehemently to them "that labour  and  are 
        heavy  laden."  Yet he can promise in the present, says: "I  give 
        unimaginable   joys  on  earth,"  making  life  worth   while; 
        "certainty,  not faith, while in life, upon death," the  electric 
        light  Knowledge  for the churchyard corpsecandle  Faith,  making 
        life   fear-free,   and  death  itself   worth   while:    "peace 
        unutterable,  rest, ecstasy," making mind and body at  ease  that 
        soul may be free to transcend them when It will.
<p>        
        I have never written such English; nor could I ever, that well I 
        know.   Shakespeare could not have written it:  still less  could 
        Keats,  Shelley, Swift, Sterne or even Wordsworth.  Only  in  the 
        Books of Job and Ecclesiastes, in the work of Blake, or  possibly 
        in  that of Poe, is there any approach to such succinct depth  of 
        thought in such musical simplicity of form, unless it be in Greek 
        and  Latin poets.  Nor Poe nor Blake could have  sustained  their 
        effort  as does this our Book of the Law; and the  Hebrews  used 
        tricks of verse, mechanical props to support them.
<p>        
        How then --back once more to the Path! --how then did it come to 
        be written ?

        The  street,  or rather streets, I do not remember.  There  is  a 
        `Place'  where  four or five streets intersect; it is  near  the 
        Boulak  Museum,  but  a fairly long  way  from  Shepherd's.   The 
        quarter is fashionable European.  The house occupied a corner.  I 
        do  not  remember  its orientation; but,  as  appears  from  the 
        instructions for invoking Horus, one window of the temple  opened 
        to  the East or North.  The apatment was of several rooms on  the 
        ground floor, well furnished in the Anglo-Egyptian style.  It was 
        let by a firm named Congdon & Co. 
<p>        
        The room was a drawing-room cleared of fragile obstacles, but not 
        otherwise  prepared to serve as a temple.  It had  double  doors, 
        poening  on to the corridor to the North and a door to  the  East 
        leading  to another room, the dining-room, I think.  It  had  two 
        windows  opening on the Place, to the South, and a writing  table 
        against the wall between them.

        pleasure.   Hence,  intense ambition to understand  the  feminine 
        nature;  for  this  purpose,  to  identify  myself  with  their 
        feelings, and to use all means appropriate.  Imaginative, subtle, 
        insatiable; the whole business a mere clumsy attempt to  quench 
        the  thirst  of  the soul.  This thirst has indeed  been  my  one

        both  active  and enduring, as our travels in Ceylon  and  across 
        China prove.  Figure perfect, neither big nor little, face pretty

        do not even know how many there were.
        <p>
<li>                Lieut.-Col.  Somebody, beginning, I think,  with  a  B, 
        married, middle-aged, with manners like the Rules of a Prison.  I 
        cannot  remember  that  I ever saw him; but  the  apartment  was 
        sublet to me by him.
        <p>
<li>                Brugsch Bey of the Boulak Museum dined with us once  to 
        discuss  the  Stele  in  his  charge,  and  to  arrage  for   its 
        "abstruction."  His French assistant curator, who translated  the 
        hieroglyphs on the Stele for us.
        <p>
<li>        A  Mr.  Bach, owner of the "Egyptian News," an hotel, a  hunk  of 
        railway, &c., &c., dined once.
</ol>
        Otherwise  we knew nobody in Cairo except  natives,  occasionally 
        hobnobbed with a General Dickson, who had accepted Islam,  carpet 
        merchant,  pimps, jewellers, and such small deer.   Contradictory 
        hints in one of my diaries were inserted deliberately to mislead, 
        for some silly no-reason unconnected with Magick.

<h3>        4.   The  events  leading  up to the  Writing  of  the  Book.   I 
        summarize them from Eqx. I, VII.</h3>
</blockquote>    
        March  16.   Tried to shew the Sylphs to Rose.  She was  in  a 
        dazed  state, stupid, possibly drunk; possibly  hysterical  from 
        pregnancy.   She  could  see nothing, but could  hear.   She  was 
        fiercely excited at the messages, and passionately insistent that 
        I should take them seriously.
<p>        
        I was annoyed at her irrelevance, and her infliction of  nonsense 
        upon me.
<p>        
        She  had never been in any state even remotely  resembling  this, 
        though  I  had made the same invocation (in full) in  the  King's 
        chamber  fo  the Great Pyramid during the night  which  we  spent 
        there in the previous autumn.
<p>        
        March  17.   More  apparently  nonsensical  messages,  this  time 
        spontaneous.   I  invoke Thoth, probably as in  Liber  LXIV,  and 
        presumably to clear up the muddle.
<p>        
        March  18.   Thoth evidently got clear through to her;  for  she 
        discovers   that  Horus  is  addressing  me  through   her,   and 
        indentifies   Him  by  a  method  utterly  excluding  chance   or 
        coincidence, and involving knowledge which only I possessed, some 
        of it arbitrary, so that she or her informant must have been able 
        to read my mind as well as if I had spolen it.
<p>        
        Then she, challenged to point out His image, passes by many  such 
        to fix on the one in the Stele.  The cross-examination must  have 
        taken place between March 20 and 23.
<p>        
        March  20.  Success in my invocation of Horus, by  "breaking  all 
        the rules" at her command.  This success convinced me  magically, 
        and  encouraged  me  to test her as above  mentioned.   I  should 
        certainly  have referred to the Stelle in my ritual had I seen  it 
        before  this date.  I should fix Monday, March 21, for the  Visit 
        to Boulak.
<p>        
        Between  March 23 and April 8 the Hieroglyphs on the  Stele  were 
        evidently  translated  by the assistant-curator at  Boulak,  into 
        either  French  or English--I am almost sure it  was  French--and 
        versified (as now printed) by me.
<p>        
        Between  these  dates, too, my wife must have told  me  that  her 
        informant  was not Horus, or Ra Hoor Khuit, but a messenger  from 
        Him, named Aiwass.
<p>        
        I  thought  that she might have faked this name  from  constantly 
        hearing "Aiwa," the word for "Yes" in Arabic.  She could not have 
        invented a name of this kind, though ; her next best was to  find 
        a phrase like "balmy puppy" ofr a friend, or corrupt a name  like 
        Neuberg into an obscene insult.
<p>        
        The silence of my diaries seems to prove that she gave me nothing 
        more  of  importance.   I was working  out  the  Magical  problem 
        presented to me by the events of March 16-21.  Any questions that 
        I asked her were either unanswered, or answered by a Being  whose 
        mind was so different from mine that we failed to converse.   All 
        my  wife  obtained  from  Him was to  command  me  to  do  things 
        magically absurd.  He would not play my game:  I must play His.
<p>        
        April  7.   Not later than this date was I ordered to  enter  the 
        "tmeple"  exactly at noon on the three days following, and  write 
        down what I heard during one hour, nor more nor less.  I  imagine 
        that  some  preparations were made, possilby  some  bull's  blood 
        burned for incense, or order taken about details of dress ro diet 
        ; I remember nothing at all, one way or the other.  Bull's  blood 
        was  burnt some time in this sojourn in Cairo ; but I forget  why 
        or when.  I think it was used at the "Invocation of the Sylphs."
<blockquote>
<h3>             5.  The actual writing.</h3>
</blockquote>        
        The three days were precisely similar, save that on the last  day 
        I became nervous lest I should fail to hear the Voice of  Aiwass.  
        They may then be described together.
<p>        
        I  went into the "temple" a minute early, so as to shut the  door 
        and sit down on the stroke of Noon.
<p>        
        On my table were my pen--a Swan Fountain--and supplies of  Quarto 
        typewriting paper, 8" x I0".
<p>        
        I never looked round in the room at any time.
<p>        
        The  Voice of Aiwass came apparently from over my left  shoulder, 
        from  the furthest corner of the room.  It seemed to echo  itself 
        in my physical heart in a very strange manner, hard to  describe.  
        I have noticed a similar phenomenon when I have been waiting  for 
        a  message  fraught  with great hope or  dread.   The  voice  was 
        passionately  poured,  as if Aiwass were alert  about  the  time-
        limit.  I wrote 65 pages of this present essay (at about my usual 
        rate of composition) in about 10 1/2 hours as against the 3 hours 
        of  the  65 pages of the Book of the Law.  I was pushed  hard  to 
        keep the pace; the MS. shows it clearly enough.
<p>        
        The  voice was of deep timbre, musical and expressive, its  tones 
        solemn,  voluptuous, tender, fierce or aught else as  suited  the 
        moods  of  the  message.   Not  bass --perhaps  a  rich  tenor  or 
        baritone.
<p>        
        The  English  was  free  of  either  native  or  foreign  accent, 
        perfectly  pure of local or caste mannerisma, thus startling  and 
        even uncanny at first hearing.
<p>        
        I had a strong impression that the speaker was actually in the 
        corner  where  he  seemed  to be, in a  body  of  "fine  matter," 
        transparent as a veil of gauze, or a cloud of incense-smoke.   He 
        seemed to be a tall, dark man in his thirties, well-knit,  active 
        and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiled  lest 
        their gaze should destroy what they saw.  The dress was not Arab; 
        it suggested Assyria or Persia, but very vaguely.  I took  little 
        note of it, for to me at that time Aiwass and an "angel" such as I 
        had often seen in visions, a being purely astral.
<p>        
        I now incline to believe that Aiwass is not only the God or Demon 
        or  Devil once held holy in Sumer, and mine own  Guradian  Angel, 
        but  also a man as I am, insofar as He uses a human body to  make 
        His magical link with Mankind, whom He loves, and that He is thus 
        and  Ipsissimus, the Head of the A.'.A.'.  Even I can do, in  a  much 
        feebler way, this Work of being a God and a Beast, &c., &c.,  all 
        at the same time, with equal fullness of life.
<blockquote>        
    <h3>         6.  The Editing of the Book.</h3>
</blockquote>        
        "Change  not so much as the style of a letter" in the text  saved 
        me from Crowley-fying the wholde Book, and spoiling everything.
<p>        
        The MS. shows what has been done, and why, as follows:
<ol type=A>        
             <li>  On page 6 Aiwaz instructs me to "write this (what he had
                 just said) in whiter words," for my mind revelled at His
                 phrase.  He added at once "But go forth on," i.e., with
                 His utterance, leaving the emendation until later.
        
             <li>  On page 19 I failed to hear a sentence, and (later on) 
                 the Scarlet Woman, invoking Aiwass, wrote in the missing
                 words.  (How?  She was not in the room at the time, and
                 heard nothing.)
        
             <li>  Page 20 of Cap. III, I got a phrase indistinctly, and 
                 she put it in, as for "B."
        
             <li>  The versified paraphrase of the hieroglyphs on the Stele
                 being ready, Aiwaz allowed me to insert these later, so 
                 as to save time.
</ol>
        These  four apart, the MS. is exactly as it was written on  those 
        three days.  The Critical Recension will explain theses points as 
        they occur.
<p>        
        The  problem of the literary form of this Book  is  astonishingly 
        complex;  but  the  internal evidence of  the  sense  is  usually 
        sufficient of make it clear, on inspection, as to who is speaking 
        and who is being addressed.
<p>        
        There  was, however, no actual voice audible save that of  Aiwaz.  
        Even  my  own  remarks made silently  were  incorporated  by  him 
        audibly, wherever such occur.
<center>        
<h4>                          Chapter I</h4>
</center>        
        Verse  1.  Nuit is the speaker.  She invokes her lover  and  then 
        begins to give a title to her speech in the end of verse I--20.
<p>        
             In  verses  3 and 4, she begins her discourse.  So  far  her 
        remarks have been addressed to no one in particular.
<p>        
             Verse 4 startled my intelligence into revolt.
<p>        
             In verse 5 she explains that she is speaking, and appeals to 
        me personally to help her to unveil by taking down her message.
<p>        
             In verse 6 she claims me for her chosen, and I think that  I 
        then became afraid lest I should be expected to do too much.  She 
        answers  this fear in verse 7 by introducing Aiwaz as the  actual 
        speaker in articulate human accents on her behalf.
<p>
        
             In verse 8 the oration continues, and we now see that it  is 
        addressed to mankind in general.  This continues till verse 13.
<p>        
             Verse  14 is from the Stele.  It seems to have been  written 
        in by me as a kind of appreciation of what she had just said.
<p>        
             Verse  15 emphasizes that it is mankind in general  that  is 
        addressed; for the Beast is spoken of in the third person, though 
        his was the only human ear to hear the words.
<p>        
             Verses 18-19 seem to be almost in the nature of a quotation 
        from  some  hymn.   It is not quite natural for  her  to  address 
        herself as she appears to do in verse 19.
<p>        
             Verse  26.   The question "Who am I and what  shall  be  the 
        sign?"  is  my own conscious thought.  In the previous  verses  I 
        have  been  called to an exalted mission, and  I  naturally  feel 
        nervous.  This thought is then entered in the record by Aiwaz  as 
        if  it  were a story that he was telling ; and he  develops  this 
        story after her answer, in order to bring bvack the thread of the 
        chapter  to the numerical mysteries of Nuith begun in verses  24-
<p>
        25, and now continued in verse 28.
<p>             Another doubt must have arisen in my mind at verse 30;  and 
        this doubt is interpreted and explained ot me personally in verse 
        31.
<p>        
             The  address  to mankind is resumed in verse 32,  and  Nuith 
        emphasizes  the point of verse 30 which has caused me  to  doubt.  
        She  confirms this with an oath, and I was convinced.  I  thought 
        to myself, "in this case let us hace written instructions as  to 
        the  technique," and Aiwaz again makes a story out of my  request 
        as in verse 26.
<p>        
             In  verse 35 it seems that she is addressing me  personally, 
        but in verse 36 she speaks of me in the third person.
<p>        
             Verse  40.  The word "us" is very puzzling.   It  apparently 
        means  "All  those  who  have accepted  the  Law  whose  word  is 
        Thelema."  Among these she includes herself.
<p>        
             There  is  now  no difficulty for a long  while.   It  is  a 
        general  address  dealing with varoious subjects, to the  end  of 
        verse 52.
<p>        
             From verses 53-56 we have a strictly personal address to me.
<p>        
             In verse 57 Nuit resumes her general exhortation.  And I am 
        spoken of once more in the third person.
<p>        
             Verse  61.  The word "Thou" is not a personal  address.   It 
        means  any single person, as pooosed to a company.  The  "Ye"  in 
        the third sentence indeicates the proper conduct for  worshippers 
        as  a  body.  The "you," in sentence 4, of course  applies  to  a 
        single person; but the plural form suggests that it is a  matter 
        of  public worship as opposed to the invocation in the desert  of 
        the first sentence of this verse.
<p>        
             There is no further difficulty in this chapter.
<p>        
             Verse  66 is the statement of Aiwaz that the words of  verse 
        65,  which were spoken diminuendo down to  pianissimo,  indicated 
        the withdrawl of the goddess.
<center>      
<h4>                             CHAPTER II</center>
                                 <p>Hadit himself is evidently the speaker from the 
                                 start.  The 
        remarks  are  general.  In verse 5 I am spoken of  in  the  third 
        person. </p>
<p>        
             After  verse 9 he notices my vehement objections to  writing 
        statements to which my conscious self was obstinately opposed.
<p>        
             Verse 10, addressed to me notes that fact ; and in verse  11 
        he declares that he is my master, and that the reason for this is 
        that he is my secret self, as explained in verses 12-13.
<p>
             The  interruption  seems  to have added  excitement  to  the 
        discourse, for verse 14 is violent.
<p>        
             Verses  15 & 16 offer a riddle, while verse 17 is a sort  of 
        parody of poetry.
<p>        
             Verse  18  continues his attack on my  conscious  mind.   In 
        verses  15-18  the  style is complicated,  brutal,  sneering  and 
        jeering.  I feel the whole passage as a contemptuous beating down 
        of the resistance of my mind.
<p>        
             In  verse 19 he returns to the exalted style with  which  he 
        began until I interfered.
<p>        
             The  passage seems addressed to what he calls his chosen  or 
        his  people, though it is not explained exactly what he means  by 
        the words.
<p>        
             This  passage from verse 19 to verse 52 is of sustained  and 
        matchless eloquence.
<p>        
             I must have objected to something in verse 52, for verse  53 
        is  directed to encourage me personally as to having  transmitted 
        this message.
  <p>      
             Verse 54 deals with another point as to the  intelligibility 
        of the message.
<p>        
             Verse  55 instructed me to obtain the English Qabalah;  it 
        made  me incredulous, as the task seemed an impossible  one,  and 
        probably  his  perception of this criticism  inspired  verse  56, 
        though "ye mockers" applies evidently to my enemies, referred  to 
        in verse 54.
<p>        
             Verse 57 brings us back to the subject begun in verse 21.  It 
        is  a  quotation from the Apocalypse verbatim,  and  is  probably 
        suggested by the matter of verse 56.
<p>        
             There is no real change in the essence of anything,  however 
        its combinations vary.
<p>        
             Verses 58-60 conclude the passage.
<p>        
             Verse 61.  The address is now strictly personal.  During all 
        this  time Hadit had been breaking down my resistance  with  his 
        violently  expresses and varied phrases.  As a result of this,  I 
        attained to the trance described in these verses from 61-68.
<p>        
             Verse 69 is the return to consciousness of myself.  It was a 
        sort  of gasping question as a man coming out of Ether might  ask 
        "Where am I?"  I think that this is the one passage in the whole 
        book  which  was not spoken by Aiwaz; and I ought  to  say  that 
        these verses 63-68 were writeen without conscious hearing at all.
<p>        
             Verse 70 does not deign to reply to my questions, but points 
        out  the way to manage life.  This continues until verse 74,  and 
        seems  to  be  addressed not to me personally but  to  any  man, 
        despite the use of the word "Thou."
<p>        
             Verse  75  abruptly changes the subject,  interpolating  the 
        riddle of verse 76 with its prophecy.  This verse is addressed to 
        me  personally,  and continues to the end of verse 78  to  mingle 
        lyrical eloquence with literal and numerical puzzles.
<p>        
        Verse  79 is the statement of Aiwaz that the end of  the  chapter 
        has come.  To this he adds his personal compliment to myself.
<h4><center>        
        
                                   Chapter III
</center></h4>        
             Verse I appears to complete the triangle begun by the  first 
        verses  of the two previous chapters.  It is a  simple  statement 
        involving no particular speaker or hearer.  The ommission of  the 
        "i" in the name of God appears to have alarmed me, and in verse 2 
        Aiwaz offers a hurried explanation in a somewhat excited  manner, 
        and invokes Ra-Hoor-Khuit.
<p>        
        Verse  3 is spoken by Ra-Hoor-Khuit.  "Them" evidently refers  to 
        some  undescribed  enemies,  and "ye" to  those  who  accept  his 
        formula.  This passage ends with verse 9.  Verse 10 and verse  11 
        are addressed to me personally and the Scarlet Woman, as shown in 
        the continuation of his passage which seems to end with verse 33, 
        though it is left rather vague at times as to whether the  Beast, 
        or  the  Beast  and his concubine, or  the  adherents  of  Horus, 
        generally, are exhorted.
<p>        
             Verse  34  is  a kind of poetical  peroration,  and  is  not 
        addressed in particular to anybody.  It is a statement of  events 
        to come.
<p>        
             Verse  35 states simply that section one of this chapter  is 
        completed.
<p>        
             I  seem to have become enthusiastic, for there is a kind  of 
        interlude  reported by Aiwaz of my song of  adoration  translated 
        form the Stele;  the incident parallels that of chapter I,  verse 
        26, &c.
<p>        
             It  is to be noted that the translations from the  Stele  in 
        verses  37-38  were  no more than instantanious  thoughts  to  be 
        inserted afterwards.
<p>        
             Verse  38  begins with my address to the God  in  the  first 
        sentence, while in the second is his reply to me.  He then refers 
        to   the  hieroglyphs  of  the  Stele,  and  bids  me  quote   my 
        paraphrases.   This  order was given by a  species  of  wordless 
        gesture,  not  visible or audible, but sensible  in  some  occult 
        manner.
<p>        
             Verses 39-42 are instructions for me personally.
<p>        
             Verses  43-45 indicate the proper course of conduct for  the 
        Scarlet Woman.
<p>        
             Verse  46  is  again  more general --a  sort  of  address  to 
        soldiers before battle.
<p>        
             Verse 47 is again mostly personal instruction, mixed up with 
        prophecies,  proof  of the praeterhuman origin of the  Book,  and 
        other matters.
<p>        
             I  observe that this instruction, taken with with those  not 
        to  change "so much as a style of a letter," etc., imply that  my 
        pen  was under the physical control of Aiwaz; for this  dictation 
        did  not  include directions as to the use of capitals,  and  the 
        occasional mis-spellings are most assuredly not mine!
<p>        
             Verse  48 impatiently dismisses such practical matters as  a 
        nuisance.
<p>        
             Verses  49-59 contain a series of declerations of  war;  and 
        there is no further difficulty as to the speaker or hearer to the 
        end of the chapter, although the subject changes repeatedly in an 
        incomprehensible manner.  Only verse 75 do we find a   perroation 
        on the whole book, presumably by Aiwaz, ending by his formula  of 
        withdrawal.
<p>        
        <hr><br>
        
             I  conclude  by laying down the principles  of  Exegesis  on 
        which I have based my comment.
<ol>
<p>             <li>   It is "my scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu" (CCXX, I,  36)  who 
        "shall comment" on "this book" "by the wisdom of  Ra-Hoor-Khuit"; 
        that is, Aleister Crowley shall write the Comment from the  point 
        of  view  of the manifested positive Lord of the Aeon,  in  plain 
        terms of the finite, and not those of the infinite.
        
<p>             <li>  "Hadit burning in thy heart shall make swift and  secure 
        thy  pen"  (CCXX, III, 40).  My own inspiration,  not  any  alien 
        advice  or  intellectual consideration, is to be  the  energizing 
        froce of this work.
<p>        
             <li>   Where  the text is simple  straightforward  English,  I 
        shall not seek, or allow, and interpretation at variance with it.
<p>     
             I may admit a Qabalistic or cryptographic secondary  meaning 
        when such confirms, amplifies, deepens, intensifies, or  clarifes 
        the obvious common-sense significance ; but only if it be part of 
        the  general  plan  of the "latent  light,"  and  self-proven  by 
        abundatnt witness.
<p>        
             For example:  "To me!" (I, 65) is to be taken primarily  in 
        its obvious sense as the Call of Nuith to us Her stars.
<p>
             The   transliteration  "TO  MH"  may  be  admitted  as   the 
        "signature"  of  Nuith, identifying Her as the  speaker;  because 
        these Greek Words mean "The Not," which is Her Name.
<p>        
             This   Gematria  of  TO  MH  may  be  admitted  as   further 
        confirmation, because their number 418 is elsewhere manifested as 
        that of the Aeon.
  <p>      
             But  TO  MH  is not to be taken  as  negating  the  previous 
        verses,  or  418 as indicating the fromula of  approach  to  Her, 
        although  in  point of fact it is so, being the  Rubrick  of  the 
        Great  Work.   I  refuse  to  consider  mere  appropriateness  as 
        conferring  title  to  authority, and to  read  my  own  personal 
        theories  into the Book.  I insist that all interpretation  shall 
        be  incontestably authentic, neither less, more, nor  other  than 
        was meant is the Mind of Aiwaz.
<p>        
             <li>  I lay claim to be the sole authority competent to decide 
        disputed  points with regard to the Book of the Law, seeing  that 
        its  Author,  Aiwaz, is none other than mine  own  Holy  Guardian 
        Angel,  to Whose Knowledge and Conversation I hace  attained,  so 
        that I have exclusive access to Him.  I have duly referred  every 
        difficulty to Him directly, and received His answer; my award  is 
        therefore absolute without appeal.
        
<p>            <li>   The verse, II, 47, "one cometh after him, whence I  say 
        not, who shall discover the key of it all," has been fulfilled by 
        "one"  Achad  is not said to extend beyond this  single  exploit; 
        Achad  is nowhere indeicated as appointed or even  authorized  to 
        relieve  The Beast of His task of the Comment.  Achad has  proved 
        himself,*1* and proved the Book, by his on achievement; and  this 
        shall suffice.
        
<p>            <li>  Wherever
<ol type=a>     <li>  The words of the Text are obscure in themselves;
                       where
                 <li>  The expression is strained; where
                 <li>  The Syntax,
                 <li>  Grammar,
                 <li>  Spelling, or
                 <li>  The use of capital letters present peculiarities;
                       where
                 <li>  Non-English words occur; where the style suggests
                 <li> Paronomasia,
                 <li>  Ambiguity, or
                 <li>  Obliquity; or where
                 <li>  A problem is explicitly declared to exist; in all 
                     such cases I shall seek for a meaning hidden by 
                     means of Qabalistic correspondences, cryptography, 
                     or literary subtleties.  I shall admit no solution 
                     which is not at once simple, striking, consonant 
                     with the general plan of the Book ; and not only 
                     adequate but necessary.
        </ol>
        Examples:
<ol type=i>
                  <li>  I, 4.  Here the obvious sense of the text is 
                    nonsense; it therefore needs intimate analysis.
                 <li>  II, I7, line 4.  The  natural order of the words is
                     distorted by placing "not" before "know me"; it is
                     proper to ask what object is attained by this 
                     peculiarity of phrasing.
                <li>  I, I3.  The text as it stands is unintelligible; it
                     calls attention to itself; a meaning must be found
                     which will not only justify the apparent error, but
                     prove the necessity of employing that and no other
                     expression.
                 <li>  II, 76.  "to be me" for "to be I."  The unusual 
                     grammar invites enquiry; it suggests that "me" is
                     a concealed name, perhaps MH,  "Not," Nuit, since
                     to be Nuit is the satisfaction of the formula of 
                     the Speaker, Hadit.
                 <li>   III, I.  The omission of the "i" in "Khuit" is in-
                     dicative that some concealed doctrine is based upon
                     the variant.
                 <li>  II, 27.  The spelling of "Because" with a capital B
                     suggests that it may be a proper name, and possibly
                     that its Greek or Hebrew equivalent may identify the
                     idea Qabalistically with some enemy of our Hierarchy; 
                     also that such word may demand a capital 
                     value for its initial.
               <li>   III, II.  "Abstruction" suggests that an idea other-
                     wise inexpressible is conveyed in this manner.  
                     Paraphrase is here inadmissible as a sufficient in-
                     terpretation; there must be a correspondence in the
                     actual structure of the word with its etymologically
                     -deduced meaning.
              <li>   III, 74.  The words "sun" and "son" are evidently
                     chosen for the identity of their sound-value; the
                     inelegance of the phrase therefroe insists on some 
                     such adequate justification as the existence of a
                     hidden treasure of meaning.
                 <li>  III, 73.  The ambiguity of the instruction warrants 
                     the supposition that the words must somehow contain
                     a cryptographic formula for so arranging the sheets 
                     of the MS. that an Arcanum becomes manifest.
                 <li>   I, 26.  The apparent evasion of a direct reply in
                     "Thou knowest !" suggests that the words conceal a
                     precise answer more convincing in cipher than their
                     openly-expressed equvialent could be.
                 <li>  II, I5.  The text explicity invites Qabalistic analysis.
  </ol>      
<p>             <li>   The  Comment  must be consistent  with  itself  at  all 
        points;  it  must  exhibit ther Book of the Law  as  of  absolute 
        authority  on  all  possible  questions  proper  to  Mankind,  as 
        offering  the perfect solution of all problems philosophical  and 
        practical without exception.
        
<p>             <li>  The Comment must prove beyond possibility of error  that 
        the Book of the Law,
        
<ol type=a>                 <li>  Bears witness in itself to the quthorship of Aiwaz,
                      an Intelligence independent of incarnation ; and
                 <li>  Is warranted wrothy of its claim to credence by the
                      evidence of external events.
        </ol>
             For  example,  the  first  proposition  is  proved  by   the 
        cryptography connected with 31, 93, 418, 666,[pi], etc.; and  the 
        second by the concurrence of circumstance with various statements 
        in the text such that the categories of time and causality forbid 
        all explanations which exclued its own postulates, while the  law 
        of probabilities makes coincidence inconceivavle as an evasion of 
        the issue.
<p>        
        
             <li>   The Comment must be expressed in terms intelligible  to 
        the  minds  of  men  of average  education,  and  independent  of 
        abstruse technicalities.
        
        <p>    <li>  The Comment must be pertinent to the problems of our own 
        tiems,  and  present  the  principles of  the  Law  in  a  manner 
        susceptible  of present practical application.  It  must  satisfy 
        all  types  of  intelligence,  neither  revolting  to   rational, 
        scientific,   mathematical,  and  philosophical   thinkers,   nor 
        repugnant to religious and romantic temperaments.
        
           <p> <li>   The  Comment must appeal on behalf of the  Law  to  the 
        authority  of Experience.  It must make Success the proof of  the 
        Truth  of  the  Book of the Law at every point  of  contact  with 
        Reality.
<p>        
             The  Word of Aiwaz must put forth a perfect presentation  of 
        the  Universe  as Necessary,  Intelligible,  Self-subsistent,  as 
        Integral,   Absolute,   and  Immanent.   It  must   satisfy   all 
        intuitions,  explain all enigmas, and compse all  conflicts.   It 
        must  reveal  Reality,  reconcile Reason  with  Relativity;  and, 
        resolving  not  only  all antinomies in  the  Absolute,  but  all 
        antipathies   in   the  appreciation  of  Aptness,   assure   the 
        acquiescence of every faculty of manking in the perfection of its 
        plenary propriety.
<p>        
             Releasing  us from every restriction upon Right, the Word  of 
        Aiwaz must extend its empire by enlisting the allegiance of every 
        man and every woman that puts its truth to the test.
<p>        
             On  these principles, to the pitch of my power, will  I  the 
        Beast  666,  who received the Book of the Law from the  Mouth  of 
        mine Angel Aiwaz, make my comment thereon ; being armed with  the 
        word:  "But the work of the comment?
        That is easy ; and Hadit in thy heart shall make swift and secure 
        thy pen."

        Editorial Note to this Chapter.
        <p>
        
             The reader is now in full possession of the account of  "how 
        thou  didst  come  hither".   The  student  who  wishes  to   act 
        intelligently  will  be  at  pains  to  make  himself  thoroughly 
        acquainted  at  the  outset  with  the  whole  of  the   external 
        circumstances  connected  with the Writing of the  Book,  whether 
        they are of biographical or other importance.  He should thus  be 
        able to approach the Book with his mind prepared to apprehend the 
        unique  character  of  their  contents  in  repect  of  its  true 
        Authorship,  the  peculiarities of Its methods  of  communicating 
        Thought,  and the nature of Its claim to be the Canon  of  Truth, 
        the Key of Progress, and the Arbiter of Conduct.  He will be able 
        to form his own judgment upon It, only insofar as he is fixed  in 
        the proper Point-of-View; the sole question for him is to  decide 
        whether  It is or is not that which It claims to be, the New  Law 
        in the same sense as the Vedas, the Pentateuch, the Tao Teh King, 
        and  Qu'ran  are Laws, but with the added  Authority  of  Verbal, 
        Literal, and Graphic inspiration established and  counter-checked 
        by   internal  evidence  with  the  impeccable  precision  of   a 
        mathematical  demonstration.   If  It be that, It  is  an  unique 
        document, valid absolutely within the terms of its self-contained 
        thesis, incomparabley more valuable than any other Transcript  of 
        Thought which we possess.
<p>        
             If  It  be not wholly that, it is a worthless  curiosity  of 
        literature;  worse,  it is an appalling proof that  no  kind  or 
        degree of evidence soever is sufficient to establish any possible 
        proposition, since the closest concatenation of circumstances may 
        be no more than the jetsam of chance, and the most  comprehensive 
        plans of purpose a puerile pantomime.  To reject this Book is  to 
        make  Reason  itself ridiculous and the Law  of  Probabilities  a 
        caprice.   In Its fall it shatters the structure of Science,  and 
        buries the whole hope of man's heart in the rubble, throwing upon 
        its  heaps  the sceptic, blinded, crippled, and  gone  melancholy 
        mad.
<p>        
             The  reader  must face the problem  squarely;  half-measures 
        will not avail.  If there be aught he recognize as transcendental 
        Truth,  he cannot admit the possibility that the Speaker,  taking 
        such pains to prove Himself and His Word, should yet  incorporate 
        Falsehood  in the same elaborate engines.  If the Book be  but  a 
        monument  of a mortal's madness, he must tremble that such  power 
        and  cunning  may  be  the accomplices  of  insane  and  criminal 
        archanarchs.
<p>        
             But if he know the Book to be justified of Itself, It  shall 
        be justified also of Its children; and he will glow with gladness 
        in  his  heart as he reads the sixty-third to  the  sixty-seventh 
        verses  of  Its  chapter, and gain his first glimpse  of  Who  he 
        himself  is in truth, and to what fulfilment of Himself It is  of 
        virtue to bring Him.
