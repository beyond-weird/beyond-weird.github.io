</h4><hr><br>        
        In  the  autumn  of  1898 George Cecil  Jones  had  directed  the 
        attention of Frater Perdurabo to a book entitled "The Book of the 
        Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage."  The essence of this book is 
        as follows :
<p>        
        The  aspirant  must  have a house  secure  from  observation  and 
        interference.   In  this house there must be an  oratory  with  a 
        window  to  the  East, and a door to the  North  opening  upon  a 
        terrace,  at  the end of which must be a lodge.  He must  have  a 
        Robe,  Crown, Wand, Altar, Incense, Anointing Oil, and  a  Silver 
        Lamen.  The terrace and lodge must be strewn with fine sand.   He 
        withdraws  himself  gradually from human  intercourse  to  devote 
        himself more and more to prayer for the space of four months.  He 
        must then occupy two months in almost continuous prayer, speaking 
        as  little as possible to anybody.  At the end of this period  he 
        invokes a being described as the Holy Guardian Angel, who appears 
        to him (or to a child employed by him), and who will write in dew 
        upon  the Lamen, which is placed upon the Altar.  The Oratory  is 
        filled with Divine Perfume not of the aspirant's kindling.
<p>        
        After  a period of communion with the Angel, he summons the  Four 
        Great  Princes  of the Daemonic World, and forces them  to  swear 
        obedience.
<p>        
        On the following day he calls forward and subdues the Eight  
    Sub-Princes; and the day after that, the many Spirits serving these.  
        These  inferior  Daemons, of whom four act as  familiar  spirits, 
        then  operate  a collection of talismans  for  various  purposes.  
        Such is a brief account of the Operation described in the book.
<p>        
        This Operation strongly appealed to our student.  He  immediately 
        set about to procure a suitable house, and to prepare  everything 
        that might be necessary for the operation.  All was ready for the 
        beginning  in  Easter  of  1900, and it must  be  said  that  the 
        preliminary  work alone is so tremendous that a long story  might 
        be written of the events of these 18 months of preparation.   The 
        Operation  itself  was however never begun.  A  fortnight  or  so 
        before the time appointed, he received an urgent appeal from  his 
        Master  to save him and the Order from destruction.  He  gave  up 
        his own prospects of personal advancement without hesitation, and 
        hastened to Paris. <em>(See the Equinox "The Temple of Solomon the King" for a fairly 
        full account of these various matters.  The "Master" was the late 
        S.L. Mathers.)</em>
<p>        
        That  the Master proved to be no Master, and the Order no  Order, 
        but  the  incarnation of Disorder, had no effect  upon  the  good 
        Karma  created by this renunciation of a project on which he  had 
        set his heart for so long.
<p>        
        In  Mexico, he kept vigil during several nights in the Temple  of 
        the Order of the Lamp of the Invisible Light, an Order whose High 
        Priest is pledged to maintain a Secret and Eternal Lamp.  In this 
        shrine he received some shadowing forth of the Vision of the Holy 
        Guardian  Angel, and that of the Four Great Princes :  here  also 
        he renewed the Oath of the Operation.
<p>        
        (The  whole  of  his magical career is best  interpreted  as  the 
        performance  of  this  Operation.   One  must  not  suppose  that 
        Initiation  is a formality, observing the "unities,"  like  being 
        made a Mason.  All life pertains to the process, and it  pervades 
        the whole personality; the official recognition of attainment is 
        merely a token of what had taken place.)
<p>        
        On his return to Scotland in 1903, he found ample evidence of the 
        presence  of  the  forces of the Operation, but  by  now,  having 
        conceived  that Work in a subtler manner and having  prepared  to 
        carry  it out in the Temple of his own body, having seen  Magick, 
        in short, more of less in the manner in which it is seen in Parts 
        II  and  III  of the Book 4, he was able  to  dispense  with  the 
        exterior physical appurtenances of this Operation.
<p>        
        We  must now pass over a few years, and deal with the  completion 
        of  this Operation, although it is in a sense irrelevant  to  the 
        purpose of this book.
<p>        
        During  the winter of 1905-6, he was traveling across China.   He 
        had  come  to the point of conquering his mind.   That  mind  had 
        broken  up.   He saw that the human mind is by  its  very  nature 
        evanescent,  because  of the fact that nature is  not  unity  but 
        duality.  Truth is relative.  All things end in mystery.  In such 
        sentences  have  the  philosophers of the  past  formulated  this 
        proposition, as announcing the intellectual bankruptcy which  he, 
        with greater frankness, describes as insanity.
<p>        
        Passing  from this, he became as a little child, and on  reaching 
        the  Unity  behind  the  mind, found  the  purpose  of  his  life 
        formulated  in  these words, The Obtaining of the  Knowledge  and 
        Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.
<p>        
        He  then  found  himself,  having  destroyed  all  other   Karma, 
        perfectly free to pursue this one work.  He then accomplished the 
        six months of Invocation, as prescribed in the Book of the Sacred 
        Magic, and was rewarded in October, 1906, by complete success. 
        <em>(An account of these matters, in part, is to be found  in  the 
        Equinox, Vol. I, No. VIII, and in his own poem "Aha !")</em>
<p>        
        He then proceeded to the evocation and conquest of the Four Great 
        Princes and their Inferiors, a work whose results must be studied 
        in the light of his subsequent career.
<p>        
        We have now finished all that is necessary to say concerning him, 
        for the account of some of his further Attainment is given  fully 
        in  Liber  CDXVIII, "The Vision and the Voice," also  in  Equinox 
        Vol.  I  No.  X  "The Temple of  Solomon  the  King,"  where  the 
        unexpected result of the Communion of the Holy Guardian Angel  is 
        shown  in  a  symbolism which can hardly  be  understood  without 
        reference  to the events of 1904, which are now wholly  pertinent 
        to this Essay.
