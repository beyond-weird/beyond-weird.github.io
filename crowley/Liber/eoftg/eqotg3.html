<BR>Oscar Eckenstein, on his arrival in Mexico, where he was to climb mountains 
with the subject of our essay, found him in a rather despondent mood. He had 
attained the most satisfactory results. He was able to communicate with thed 
divine forces, and operations such as those of invisibility and evocation had 
been mastered. Yet with all this there was a certain dissatisfaction. Success 
had not given him all that he had hoped for. He placed the situration before his 
companion, rather to clear his own mind than hoping for any help, for he 
supposed him to be entirely ignorant of all these subjects, which he habitually 
treated with dislike and contempt. Judge of his surprise, then, when he found in 
this unpromising quarter a messenger form the Great White Brotherhood ! His 
companion told him to abandon all magick. <p>"The Task," said Eckenstein, 
"involves the control of the mind. Yours is a wandering mind." The proposition 
was indignantly denied. <p>"Test it," said the Master. A short experiment 
was conclusive. It was impossible for the boy to keep his mind fixed upon a 
single object for even a few seconds at a time. The mind, thougfh perfectly 
stable in motion, was unable to rest, just as a gyroscope falls when the 
flywheel slows down. An entirely new course of experiments was consequently 
undertaken. Half-an-hour every morning and half-an-hour every evening were 
devoted to attempts to control the mind, by the simple process of imagining a 
familiar object, and endeavouring to keep concentrated upon it. <EM>(See Part I 
of Book 4 for a description of this, and an explanation of the difficulty of the 
task, even in the case of one whose powers of concentrated attention, in the 
ordinary sense of the phrase, are highly developed.)</EM> <p>He soon became 
sufficiently expert in this initial practice to proceed to concentration on 
regularly moving objects such as a pendulum, and, ultimately, on living objects. 
A further series of experiments dealt with the other senses. He tried to imagine 
and retain the taste of chocolate or of quinine, the smell of various familiar 
perfumes, the sound of bells, waterfalls, and so on, or the feeling excited by 
such objects as velvet, silk, fur, sand and steel. <p>In the spring of 
1901, he left Mexico, went to San Francisco, Honolulu, Japan, China and Ceylon, 
always continuing these experiments. His Master had not told him to what they 
would ultimately lead. In Ceylon he found Frater I.A. (Allan Bennett), with whom 
he went to Kandy, where they took a bungalow named Marlboroigh, overlooking the 
lake. <p>I.A. had himself been developing on similar lines under P. 
Ramanathan, the Solicitor-General of Ceylon, known to occultists under the name 
of Shri Parananda. <EM>(He is the author of commentaries on the Gospels of 
Matthew and John, which he explains as containing many of the aphorisms of 
Yoga.)</EM> I.A. told him that in order to concentrate he must first see that no 
interruptions reached him from the body, and counselled the adoption of Asana, a 
settled position in which all bodily movement was to be suppressed. Further, he 
was to practice Pranayama, or control of the breathing, which has a similar 
effect in reducing to the lowest possible point the internal movements of the 
body. <EM>(See Part I of Book 4 for full descriptions, and Equinox for some of 
FRATER PERDURABO'S records of these practices.)</EM> <p>During the months 
of this stay at Kandy, he practised these, obtained success in Asana, the 
intense pain of the practices being overcome, and changed into an indescribable 
sense of physical well-being and comfort. <p>While in Pranayama he passed 
through the first stage, which is marked by profuse perspiration of a peculiar 
kind; the second, which is accompanied by rigidity of the body ; and the third, 
in which the body unconsciously hops about the floor, without in any way 
disturbing the Asana. <p>During the latter part of August and the whole of 
September, his practices became continous by day and night, in order to create a 
rhythm in the mind similar to that which Pranayama produces in the body. He 
adopted a Mantra, or sacred sentence, by the constant repetition of which it 
became automatic in his brain, so that it would continue through sleep, and he 
would wake up actually repeating the words. Sleep itself, too, was broken up 
into short periods of very light sleep of a peculiar kind, in which 
consciousness is hardly lost, althougfh the body obtains perdect rest. These 
practices continued into October, at the beginning of which he reached the state 
of Dhyana, a tremendous spiritual experience, in which the subject and object of 
meditation unite with excessive violence in blinding brilliance and music of a 
kind to which earthly harmony affords no parallel. <EM>(See Part I of Book 4, 
and Equinox Vol. I, No. IV.)</EM> <p>The result of this however was to 
cause so intense a satisfaction with his progress, that he gave up work. He then 
visited Anuradhapura and others of the buried cities of Ceylon. In November he 
went to India, and in January visited I.A. at Akyab in Burma,where that Adept 
was living in a monastery, with the intention of preparing himself to take the 
Yellow Robe of the Buddhist Sangha. The whole of the summer of I902 was spent in 
an expedition to Chogo Ri (K2) in the Himalayas. <EM>(An account of this journey 
is given by Dr. Jacot-Guillarmod: "Six mois dans l'Himalaya." His own story is 
in "The Spirit of Solitude" (The Confessions of Aleister Crowley) Vol. II.)</EM> 
During the whole of this period he did very little occult work. 
<p>November, 1902, him in Paris, where he stayed off and on till the spring 
of 1903, when he returned to his house in Scotland. <p>We must now go 
backwards in time, to take up a thread which had run through his whole work, so 
umportant as to demand a chapter to itself:-- <p>
