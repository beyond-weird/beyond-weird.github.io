<h1 align="center" class="title">THE SUMMONS.</h2>
<h4>        
             On  April 8, 9 and 10, 1904, e.v. this book was dictated  to 
        666  (Aleister Crowley) by Aiwass, a Being whose nature  he  does 
        not fully understand, but who described Himself as "the  Minister 
        of Hoor-Paar-Kraat" (the Lord of Silence).
<p>        
             The  contents of the book prove to strict scientific  demon-
        stration  that  He  possesses knowledge and  power  quite  beyond 
        anything that has been hitherto associated with human faculties.
<p>        
             The  circumstances  of the dictation are  described  in  the 
        Equinox, Vol. I, No. vii:  but a fuller account, with an  outline 
        of  the  proof  of the character of the book is now  here  to  be 
        issued.
<p>        
             The book announces a New Law for mankind.
<p>        
             It  replaces the moral and religious sanctions of the  past, 
        which have everywhere broken down, by a principle valid for  each 
        man and woman in the world, and self-evidently indefeasible.
<p>        
             The  spiritual Revolution announced by the book has  already 
        taken place:  hardly a country where it is not openly manifest.
<p>        
             Ignorance  of  the true meaning of this new Law has  led  to 
        gross anarchy.  Its conscious adoption in its proper sense is the 
        sole cure for the political, social and racial unrest which
        have  brought about the World War, the catastrophe of Europe  and 
        America, and the threatening attitude of China, India and Islam.
<p>        
             Its solution of the fundamental problems of mathematics  and 
        philosophy will establish a new epoch in history.
<p>        
             But it must not be supposed that so potent an instrument  of 
        energy can be used without danger.
<p>        
             I summon, therefore, by the power and authority entrusted to 
        me,  every great spirit and mind now on this planed incarnate  to 
        take  effective hold of this transcendent force, and apply it  to 
        the advancement of the welfare of the human race.
<p>        
             For  as  the experience of these two and  thirty  years  has 
        shown too terribly, the book cannot be ignored.  It has  leavened 
        Mankind  unaware:  and Man must make thereof the Bread  of  Life.  
        Its ferment has begun to work on the grape of thought:  Man  must 
        obtain therefrom the Wine of Ecstasy.
<p>        
             Come then, all ye, in the Name of the Lord of the Aeon,  the 
        Crowned  and Conquering Child, Heru-Ra-Ha:  I call ye to  partake 
        this sacrament.
<p>        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            Know-will-dare-and be silent!
<p>        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                          The Priest of the Princes,
        
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                          ANKH-AF-NA-KHONSU.
