        It  has been judged best to reprint as it stands the  account  of 
        these matters originally compiled for "The Temple of Solomon  the 
        King."  (Equinox Vol. I, No. VII, pp 357-386.) <em>(The notes for this article were worked out in  collaboration 
        with  Captain (now Major-General) J.F.C. Fuller.  Every means  of 
        cross-examination was pressed to the utmost.)</em>
<p><hr><h3><center>
                                   THE PRIEST
</center></h3>        
        In opening this the most important section of Frater P.'s career, 
        we may be met by the unthinking with the criticism that since  it 
        deals  rather with his relation to others than with his  personal 
        attainment, it has no place in this volume. <em>(Projected by Fuller as no more than a record of the  personal 
        attainment of Aleister Crowley.)</em>
<p>
        Such  criticism is indeed shallow.  True, the incidents which  we 
        are  about to record took place on planes material or  contiguous 
        thereto;  true, so obscure is the light by which we  walk  that 
        much must be left in doubt; true, we have not as yet the supreme 
        mystical  attainment to record; but on the other hand it is  our 
        view  that the Seal set upon Attainment may be  itself  fittingly 
        recorded  in  the story of that Attainment, and that no  step  in 
        progress  is  more  important than that when it is  said  to  the 
        aspirant:   "Now that you are able to walk alone, let it be  your 
        first  care  to use that strength to help others!"  And  so  this 
        great  event which we are about to describe, an event which  will 
        lead, as time will show, to the establishment of a New Heaven and 
        New Earth for all men, wore the simplest and humblest guise.   So 
        often the gods come clad as peasants or as children; nay, I have 
        listened to their voices in stones and trees.
<p>        
        However,  we must not forget that there are persons so  sensitive 
        and  so credulous that they are convinced by anything, I  suppose 
        that there are nearly as many beds in the world as there are  men;
        yet for the Evangelical every bed conceals its Jesuit.
<p>        
        We  get  "Milton composing baby rhymes" and "Locke  reasoning  in 
        gibberish," divine revelations which would shock the intelligence 
        of  a  sheep or a Saxon ; and we find these upheld  and  defended 
        with skill and courage.
<p>        
        Therefore, since we are to announce the divine revelation made to 
        Fra.  P., it is of the last importance that we should  study  his 
        mind as is was at the time of the Unveiling.  If we find it to be 
        the mind of a neurotic, of a mystic, of a person predisposed,  we 
        shall slight the revelation ; if it be that of a sane man of  the 
        world, we shall attach more importance to it.
<p>        
        If  some  dingy  Alchemist  emerges  from  his  laboratory,   and 
        proclaims  to all Tooting that he has made gold, men doubt;  but 
        the conversion to spiritualism of Professor Lombroso made a great 
        deal  of  impression  on those who did not  understand  that  his 
        criminology was but the heaped delusion of a diseased brain.
<p>        
        So  we shall find that the A.A. subtly prepared Fra. P.  by  over 
        two  years' training in rationalism and indifferentism for  Their 
        message.   And we shall find that so well did They do Their  work 
        that he refused the message for five years more, in spite of many 
        strange proofs of its truth.  We shall find even that Fra. P. had 
        to  be  stripped  naked of himself before  he  could  effectively 
        deliver the message.
<p>        
        The battle was between all that mighty will of his and the  Voice 
        of a Brother who spoke once, and entered again into His silence ; 
        and it was not Fra. P. who had the victory.
<p>        
        We  left Fra. P. in the autumn of 1901 having  made  considerable 
        progress in Yoga.  We noted that in 1902 he did little or nothing 
        either  in Magic or Mysticism.  The interpretation of the  occult 
        phenomena which he had observed occupied him exclusively, and his 
        mind was more and more attracted to materialism.
<p>        
        What  are phenomena? he asked.  Of noumena I know and  can  know 
        nothing.  All I know is, as far as I know, a mere modification of 
        the  mind, a phase of consciousness.  And thought is a  secretion 
        of the brain.  Consciousness is a function of the brain.
<p>        
        If this thought was contradicted by the obvious, "And what is the 
        brain?  A phenomenon in mind!", it weighed less with him.   It 
        seemed to his mind as yet unbalanced (for all men are  unbalanced 
        until they have crossed the Abyss), that it was more important to 
        insist on matter than on mind.  Idealism wrought such misery, was 
        the father of all illusion, never led to research.  And yet, what 
        odds?   Every act or thought is determined by  an  infinity  of 
        causes,  is the resultant of an infinity of forces.  He  analysed 
        God,  saw that every man had made God in his own image,  saw  the 
        savage  and cannibal Jews devoted to a savage and  cannibal  God, 
        who  commanded  the  rape of virgins and  the  murder  of  little 
        children.    He  saw  the  timid  inhabitants  of  India,   races 
        continually  the  prey  of  every  robber  tribe,  inventing  the 
        effeminate  Vishnu; while, under the same name, their  conquerors 
        worshiped  a warrior, the conqueror of Demon Swans.  He  saw  the 
        flower  of earth throughout all time, the gracious  Greeks,  what 
        gracious  gods they had invented.  He saw Rome, in  its  strength 
        devoted  to Mars, Jupiter and Hercules, in its decay  turning  to 
        emasculate  Attis,  slain  Adonis,  murdered  Osiris,   crucified 
        Christ.   He could even trace in his own life  every  aspiration, 
        every devotion, as a reflection of his physical and  intellectual 
        needs.   He saw, too, the folly of all this supernaturalism.   He 
        heard the Boers and the British pray to the same Protestant  God, 
        and it occurred to him that the early success of the former might 
        be due rather to superior valour than to superior praying  power, 
        and  their  eventual defeat to the circumstance that  they  could 
        only  bring 60,000 men against a quarter of a million.   He  saw, 
        too,  the  face of humanity mired in its own blood  that  dripped 
        from the leeches of religion fastened to its temples.
<p>        
        In  all this he saw man as the only thing worth holding to;  the 
        one thing that needed to be  "saved," but also the one thing that 
        could save it.
<p>        
        All that he had attained, then, he abandoned.  The intuitions  of 
        the  Qabalah  were cast behind him with a smile at  his  youthful 
        folly; magic, if true, led nowhere; Yoga had become psychology.  
        For  the  solution of his original problems of  the  universe  he 
        looked  to metaphysics ; he devoted his intellect to the cult  of 
        absolute reason.  He took up once more with Kant, Hume,  Spencer, 
        Huxley, Tyndall, Maudsley, Mansel, Fitche, Schelling, Hegel,  and 
        many another ; while as for his life, was he not a man?  He  had 
        a  wife; he knew his duty to the race, and to his  own  ancient 
        graft  thereof.  He was a traveller and a sportsman; very  well, 
        then,  live it!  So we find that from November, 19O1 he  did  no 
        practices of any kind until the Spring Equinox of 1904, with  the 
        exception  of  a  casual  week in the  summer  of  1903,  and  an 
        exhibition  game  of magick in the King's Chamber  of  the  Great 
<p>
        Pyramid in November, 1903, when by his invocations he filled that 
        chamber  with  a brightness as of full moonlight.  (This  was  no 
        subjective  illusion.  The light was sufficient for him  to  read 
        the  ritual by.)  Only to conclude, "There, you see it?   What's 
        the good of it?"
<p>        
        We  find  him climbing mountains, skating, fishing,  hunting  big 
        game,  fulfilling the duties of a husband; we find him with  the 
        antipathy to all forms of spiritual thought and work which  marks 
        disappointment.
<p>        
        If  one goes up the wrong mountain by mistake, as may happen,  no 
        beauties of that mountain can compensate for the  disillusionment 
        when the error is laid bare.  Leah may have been a very nice girl 
        indeed,  but  Jacob  never  cared for  her  after  that  terrible 
        awakening to find her face on the pillow when, after seven years' 
        toil, he wanted the expected Rachel.
<p>        
        So Fra. P., after five years barking up the wrong tree, had  lost 
        interest  in  trees  altogether  as  far  as  climbing  them  was 
        concerned.   He  might indulge in a little human pride:   "See, 
        Jack,  that's the branch I cut my name on when I was a boy";  but 
        even the golden fruit of Eternity in its branches, he would  have 
        done no more than lift his gun and shoot the pigeon that  flitted 
        through its foliage.
<p>        
        Of  this  "withdrawal from the vision" the proof  is  not  merely 
        deducible  from  the  absence  of all  occult  documents  in  his 
        dossier, and from the full occupation of his life in external and 
        mundane  duties  and  pleasures, but  is  made  irrefragible  and 
        emphatic  by the positive evidence of his writings.  Of these  we 
        have   several  examples.   Two  are  dramatisations   of   Greek 
        mythology, a subject offering every opportunity to the occultist.  
        Both  are markedly free from any such allusions.  We have also  a 
        slim booklet, `Rosa Mundi,' in which the joys of pure human  love 
        are  pictured  without  the faintest  tinge  of  mystic  emotion.  
        Further, we have a play, `The God Eater,' in which the Origin  of 
        Religion,  as  conceived by Spencer or  Frazer,  is  dramatically 
        shown  forth; and lastly we have a satire,  `Why  Jesus  Wept,' 
        hard,  cynical,  and  brutal  in its  estimate  of  society,  but 
        careless of any remedy for its ills.
<p>        
        It is as if the whole past of the man with all its aspiration and 
        attainment  was  blotted out.  He saw life (for the  first  time, 
        perhaps)   with  commonplace  human  eyes.   Cynicism  he   could 
        understand,  romance he could understand; all beyond  was  dark.  
        Happiness was the bedfellow of contempt.
<p>        
        We learn that, late in 1903, he was proposing to visit China on a 
        sporting   expedition,   when   a   certain   very    commonplace 
        communication made to him by his wife caused him to postpone  it.  
        "Let's  go and kill something for a month or two," said he,  "and 
        if you're right, we'll get back to nurses and doctors."
<p>        
        So  we  find them in Hambantota, the  south-eastern  province  of 
        Ceylon, occupied solely with buffalo, elephant, leopard, sambhur, 
        and the hundred other objects of the chase.
<p>        
        We  here  insert  extracts  from  the  diary,  indeed  a   meagre 
        production--after  what  we have seen of his previous  record  in 
        Ceylon.
<p>        
        Whole  weeks  pass  without a word; the great  man  was  playing 
        bridge, poker, or golf!
<p>        
        The  entry  of  February 19th reads as if it  were  going  to  be 
        interesting, but it is followed by that of February 20th.  It  is 
        however  certain that about the 14th of March he took  possession 
        of a flat in Cairo--in the Season!
<br><blockquote>        
             Can bathos go further ?
<br>             So that the entry of March I6th is dated from Cairo.

</table>        
<br>        Before  we  go further into the history of this  period  we  must 
        premise as follows.
<p>        
        Fra. P. never made a thorough record of this period.  He seems to 
        have  wavered  between absolute scepticism in the  bad  sense,  a 
        dislike  of the revelation, on the one hand, and real  enthusiasm 
        on  the other.  And the first of these moods would induce him  to 
        do  thins to spoil the effect of the latter.  Hence the  "blinds" 
        and stupid meaningless cyphers which deface the diary.
<p>        
        And,  as  if the Gods themselves wished to darken the  Pylon,  we 
        find  later, when P.'s proud will had been broken, and he  wished 
        to make straight the way of the historian, his memory (one of the 
        finest  memories  in the world) was utterly incompetent  to  make 
        everything certain.
<p>        
        However,  nothing of which he was not certain will be entered  in 
        this place.
<p>        
        We have one quite unspoiled and authoritative document:
<p>        
        "The  Book  of  Results," written in one of  the  small  Japanese 
        vellum  note-books  which he used to  carry.   Unfortunately,  it 
        seems  to  have been abandoned after five  days.   What  happened 
        between March 23rd and April 8th?
                                   <p align="center">        
        
<strong>                               THE BOOK OF RESULTS</strong><p>

        March 16th Die <em>[mercury] (ie, wednesday)</em> I invoke IAO.
              (Fra. P. tells us that this was done by the ritual of the       
              "Bornless One," identical with the "Preliminary In-
               vocation" (See "Magick" Appendix Liber CXX.)
 in the "Goetia," merely to amuse his wife
               by showing her the sylphs.  She refused or was unable 
               th see any sylphs, but became "inspired," and kept on
               saying:  "They're waiting for you !")
<blockquote><em>                   (Note.  The maiden name of his wife was Rose
                   Edith Kelly.  He called her Ouarda, the Arabic for   
                   for  "Rose."  She is hereafter signified by
                   "Ouarda the Seer" or "W." for short.  Ed.)</em></blockquote>
               W. says "they" are "waiting for me."

        success, indwells us.  (Yes ; but what happened?  Fra. P. has no 
        sort of idea.)

        18.<em>[Venus] (Friday)</em>    Revealed that the waiter was
Horus, whom  I  had 
        offended  and ought to invoke.  The ritual revealed in  skeleton.  
        Promise of success <em>[Saturn] (Saturday)</em> or <em>[Sun] (Sunday)</em> and of Samadhi.            
        (Is this "waiter" another sneer?  We are uncertain.)
<blockquote>        
                The revealing of the ritual (by W. the seer) consisted
                chiefly in a prohibition of all formulae hitherto used,
                as will be seen from the text printed below.
</blockquote>        
        It  was  probable  on this day that P.  cross-examined  W.  about 
        Horus.  Only the striking character of her identification of  the 
        God,  surely,  would  have  made him trouble  to  obey  her.   He 
        remembers  that he only agreed to obey her in order to  show  her 
        how silly she was, and he taunted her that "nothing could  happen 
        of you broke all the rules."
<p>        
        Here  therefore  we insert a short note by Fra. P.  how  W.  knew 
        R.H.K. (Ra Hoor Khuit)
<p>        
<ol><li>            Force  and  Fire  (I  asked  her  to  describe  his   moral 
        qualities.)
        
<li>             Deep blue light.  (I asked her to describe the  conditions 
        caused by him.  This light is quite unmistakable and unique ; but 
        of  course  her  words, though a fair description  of  it,  might 
        equally apply to some other.)
        
<li>             Horus.  (I asked her to pick out his name from a  list  of 
        ten dashed off at haphazard.)
        
<li>             Recognized  his figure when shown.  (This  refers  to  the 
        striking scene in the Boulak Museum, which will be dealt with  in 
        detail.)
        
<li>           Knew my past relations with the God.  (This means, I  think, 
        that she knew I had taken his place in temple,<em>(See Equinox Vol. I, No. II, the Neophyte Ritual of the G.D.)</em>
 etc., and  that 
        I had never once invoked him.)
        
<li>    Knew  his enemy.  (I asked, "Who is his  enemy?"   Reply, 
        "Forces  of the waters--of the Nile."  W. knew no  Egyptology--or 
        anything else.)

<li>           Knew his lineal figure and its colour.  (A I/84 chance.)

<li>           Knew his place in temple.  (A I/4 chance, at the least.)

<li>           Knew his weapon (from a list of 6.)

<li>          Knew his planetary nature (from a list of 7 planets.)

<li>          Knew his number (from a list of I0 units.)

<li>           Picked  him  out of (a)Five,  (b)Three}  indifferent,  i,e, 
        arbitrary  symbols.   (This means that I settled in my  own  mind 
        that  say D of A,B,C,D, and E should represent him and  that  she 
        then said D.)
</ol>        
        We  cannot too strongly insist on the extraordinary character  of 
        this identification.
<p>        
        We had made no pretension to clairvoyance; nor had P. ever tried 
        to train her.
<p>        
        P.  had great experience with clairvoyants, and it was  always  a 
        point  of  honour  with him to bowl them out.   And  here  was  a 
        novice,  a  woman who should never have been  allowed  outside  a 
        ballroom,  speaking with the authority of God, and proving it  by 
        unhesitating correctness.
<p>        
        One slip, and Fra. P. would have sent her to the devil.  And that 
        slip  was  not  made.  Calculate the odds!   We  cannot  find  a 
        mathematical expression for tests 1,2,3,4,5, or 6, but the  other 
        7 tests give us
<blockquote>        
             1/10 x 1/84 x 1/4 x 1/6 x 1/7 x 1/I0 x 1/I5 = 1/21,168,000
</blockquote>        
        Twenty-one  million to one against her getting through  half  the 
        ordeal!
<p>        
        Even   if  we  suppose  what  is  absurd,  that  she   knew   the 
        correspondences of the Qabalah as well as Fra. P., and had know-
        ledge of his own secret relations with the Unseen, we must strain 
        telepathy to explain test 12.
<p>        
        (Note.   We may add, too, that Fra. P. thinks, but is  not  quite 
        certain, that he also tested her with the Hebrew Alphabet and the 
        Tarot  trumps, in which case the long odds must be still  further 
        multiplied by 484, bringing them over the billion mark!
<p>        
        But  we  know  that  she was perfectly  ignorant  of  the  subtle 
        correspondences,  which were only existing at that time  in  Fra. 
        P.'s own brain.
<p>        
        And even if it were so, how are we to explain what  followed--the 
        discovery of the Stele of Revealing?
<p>        
        To  apply test 4, Fra.P. took her to the museum at Boulak,  which 
        they had not previously visited.  She passed by (as P. noted with 
        silent  glee)  several images of Horus.  They went  upstairs.   A 
        glass case stood in the distance, too far off for its contents to 
        be  recognized.   But  W. recognized it !   "There,"  she  cried, 
        "There he is !"
<p>
        Fra.  P. advanced to the case.  There was the image of  Horus  in 
        the form of Ra Hoor Khuit painted upon a wooden stele of the 26th 
        dynasty--and the exhibit bore the number 666! <em>(666 had been taken by Fra. P. as the number of His own  Name 
        (The Beast) long years before, in His childhood.  There could  be 
        no physical causal connection here ; and coincidence,  sufficient 
        to explain this one isolated fact, becomes inadequate in view  of 
        the other evidence.)</em>
<p>        
        (And  after  that it was five years before Fra. P. was  force  to 
        obedience !)
<p>        
        This incident must have occurred before the 23rd of March, as the 
        entry on that date refers to Ankh-f-n-khonsu.
<p>        
        Here is P.'s description of the Stele.  "In the museum at  Cairo, 
        No. 666 is the stele of the Priest Ankh-f-n-khonsu.
<p>        
        Horus had a red Disk and green Uraeus.
<p>        
        His face is green, his skin indigo.
<br>        His necklace, anklets, and bracelets are gold.
<br>        His nemyss nearly black from blue.
<br>        His tunic is the Leopard's skin, and his apron green and gold.
<br>        Green is the wand of double Power; his r.h. is empty.
<br>        His throne is indigo the gnomon, red the square.
<br>        The light is gamboge.
<br>        Above  him  are  the  Winged Globe and the  bent  figure  of  the 
        heavenly Isis, her hands and feet touching earth.
<p>        
        (We  print the most recent translation of the Stele,  by  Messrs.  
        Alan  Gardiner,  Litt.  D., and  Battiscombe  Gunn.   It  differs 
        slightly  from  that  used  by Fra. P.,  which  was  due  to  the

        (It  is  not clear what happened in this invocation; but  it  is 
        evident  from another note of certainly later date,  that  "great 
        success" does not mean "Samadhi."  For P. writes:  "I make it  an 
        absolute condition that I should attain Samadhi in the god's  won 
        interest."   His  memory  concurs in this.  It  was  the  Samadhi 
        attained  in  October, 1906, that set him again in  the  path  of 
        obedience to this revelation.
<p>

<p align="center"><strong>CONFESSION</strong></p>

        Unprepared  and uninvoking Thee, I, OY MH, Fra R.R. et  A.C.,  am 
        here in Thy Presence--for Thou art Everywhere, O Lord Horus! --to 
        confess humbly before Thee my neglect and scorn of Thee.
<p>        
        How  shall  I humble myself enough before Thee?   Thou  art  the 
        mighty  and unconquered Lord of the Universe:  I am a  spark  of 
        Thine unutterable Radiance.
<p>
        How should I approach Thee?  but Thou art Everywhere.
<p>        
        But  Thou hast graciously deigned to call me unto Thee,  to  this 
        Exorcism of Art, that I may be Thy Servant, Thine Adept, O Bright 
        One,  O  Sun of Glory!  Thou hast called me --should I  not  then 
        hasten to Thy Presence?
<p>        
        With  unwashen hands therefore I come unto Thee, and I lament  my 
        wandering from Thee --but Thou knowest!
<p>        
             Yea, I have evil!
<p>        
        If  one (doubtless a reference to S.R.M.D. who was much  obsessed 
        by Mars, P. saw Horus at first as Geburah; later as an aspect of 
        Tiphereth,   including  Chesed  and  Geburah--the  red   Triangle 
        inverted--an  aspect  opposite to Osiris.) blasphemed  Thee,  why 
        should I therefore forsake Thee?  But Thou art the Avenger; all 
        is with Thee.
<p>        
        I  bow  my neck before Thee; and as once Thy sword was  upon  it 
        (see  G.D. Ceremony of Neophyte, the Obligation), so am I in  Thy 
        hands.   Strike if Thou wilt:  spare if Thou wilt:  but  accept 
        me as I am.
<p>        
        My trust is in Thee: shall I be confounded?  This Ritual of Art;
        this  Forty  and  Fourfold  Invocation;  this  Sacrifice  of 
        Blood--(Merely,  we suppose, that 44=DM, blood.  Possibly a  bowl 
        of  blood was used.  P. thinks it was in some of the workings  at 
        this  time, but is not sure if it was this one.)--these I do  not 
        comprehend.
<p>        
        It is enough if I obey Thy decree; did Thy fiat go forth for  my 
        eternal  misery,  were it not my joy to execute Thy  Sentence  on 
        myself?
<p>        
        For why?  For that All is in Thee and of Thee; it is enough  if 
        I burn up in the intolerable glory of Thy presence.
<p>        
        Enough!  I turn toward Thy Promise.
<p>        
        Doubtful  are the Words:  Dark are the Ways:  but in Thy  Words 
        and  Ways is Light.  Thus then now as ever, I enter the  Path  of 
        Darkness, if haply so I may attain the Light.

             The Adoration--impromptu.
<p>        
             Close  by  banishing.   (I think this was  omitted  at  W.'s 
        order.---P.)
<p>        
        
        During  the period March 23rd--April 8th, whatever else may  have 
        happened, it is at least certain that work was continued to  some 
        extent,  that the inscriptions of the stele were  translated  for 
        Fra.  P.,  and that he paraphrased the latter in verse.   For  we 
        find him using, or prepared to use, the same in the text of Liber 
        Legis.
<p>        
        Perhaps then, perhaps later, he made out the "name coincidences of 
        the Qabalah," to which we must now direct the reader's attention.
<p>        
        The MS. is a mere fragmentary sketch.<br>
        Ch=8=ChlTh=418 Abrahadabra=RA-HVVR (Ra-Hoor).
<br>        
             Also 8 is the great symbol I adore.
<br><em>             (This  may be because of its likeness to [?] or  because  of 
        its   [old  G.D.]  attributions  to  Daath,  P.  being   then   a 
        rationalist; or for some other reason.)</em>
<br>             So is O.
<br>             O=A in the Book of Thoth <em>(The Tarot)</em>.
<br>             A=111 with all its great meanings, <em>[sun]</em>=6
<br>             Now 666=My name, the number of the stele, the number of  The 
        Beast <em>(See Apocalypse)</em>, the number of the Man.
<br>             The  Beast  AChIHA=666  in full.   (The  usual  spelling  is 
        ChIVA.)
<br>             (A=111, Ch=418, I=20, H=6, A=111.)
<br>             HRV-RA-HA.  211 + 201 + 6=418.
<br>             This  name  occurs only in L. Legis, and is a test  of  that 
        book rather than of the stele.)
<br>             ANKH-P-N-KHONShU-T=666
<br><em>             (We  trust the addition of the termination T will  be  found 
        justifies.)</em>
<br>            {Bes-n-maut, B I Sh N A - M A V T }=888
<br>            {Ta-Nich,      Th A - N I Ch      }=Ch x A.
<br>             Nuteru  NVTh IRV=666
<br>             Montu  MVNTV=111.
<br>             Aiwass  AIVAS=78, the influence or messenger, or the Book T.  
<br>        <em>(P.S. Note this error! Ed.)</em>
<br>             Ta-Nich TA-NICh = 78.  Alternatively, Sh for Ch gives 370, O 
        Sh, Creation.
<p>             So much we extract from volumes filled with minute  calcula-
        tions,  of which the bulk is no longer intelligible even to  Fra. 
        P.
<p>        
        His  memory, however, assures us that the coincidences were  much 
        more  numerous  and  striking than those we  have  been  able  to 
        reproduce  here; but his attitude is, we understand  that  after 
        all "It's all in Liber Legis.  `Success is thy proof:  argue not; 
        convert not; talk not overmuch!'"  And indeed in the Commentary 
        to  that  Book  will be found sufficient for  the  most  wary  of 
        inquirers.
<p>        
        Now  who, it may be asked, was Aiwass?  It is the name given  by 
        W. to P. as that of her informant.  Also it is the name given  as 
        that  of  the revealer of Liber Legis.  But whether Aiwass  is  a 
        spiritual  being, or a man known to Fra. P., is a matter  of  the 
        merest  conjecture.   His  number is 78, that  of  Mezla,  the 
        Channel  through  which  Macroprosopus  reveals  Himself  to,  or 
        showers His influence upon, Microposopus (I.e. the messenger of God to Man). <em>(But see the miraculous events connected with "The Revival  of 
        Magick" described in Magick pp. 257-260, where he is shewn as 93.)</em>  So we find Fra.  P. 
        speaking of him at one time as of another, but more advanced  man; 
        at another time as if it were the name of his own superior  in 
        the  Spiritual Hierarchy.  And to all questions Fra. P.  finds  a 
        reply,  either pointing out "the subtle metaphysical  distinction 
        between  curiosity and hard work," or indicating that  among  the 
        Brethren  "names are only lies," or in some other  way  defeating 
        the very plain purpose of the historian.
<p>        
        The   same  remark  applies  to  all  queries  with   regard   to 
        V.V.V.V.V. <em>(The motto of Fra. P. as a Magister Templi 8[degree] =  3[?]; 
        He  used  it in His office of giving out the "Official  Books  of 
        A.A." to the word in the Equinox.)</em>;
   with  this  addition,  that  in  this  case   he 
        condescends  to argue and to instruct.  "If I tell you," he  once 
        said  to the present writer, "that V.V.V.V.V. is a Mr. Smith  and 
        lives  at Clapham, you will at once go round and  tell  everybody 
        that  V.V.V.V.V.  is a Mr. Smith of Clapham, which is  not  true.  
        V.V.V.V.V.  is the Light of the World itself, the  sole  Mediator 
        between God and Man; and in your present frame of mind (that  of 
        a  poopstick)  you  cannot see that the  two  statements  may  be 
        identical  for  the  Brothers  of  the  A.'.A.'.!   Did  not   your 
        greatgrandfather  argue  that  no good thing could  come  out  of 
        Nazareth?  `Is not this the carpenter's son?  is not his mother 
        called  Mary?  and his brethren, James and Joses, and Simon,  and 
        Judas?  And his sisters, are they not all with us?  Whence then 
        hath  this  man  all these things?  And they  were  offended  in 
        him.'"
<p>        
        Similarly with regard to the writing of Liber Legis, Fr. P.  will 
        only say that it is in no way "automatic writing,"  that he heard 
        clearly  and  distinctly the human articulate accents of  a  man.  
        Once,  on  page 6, he is told to edit a sentence ; and  once,  on 
        page 19, W. supplies a sentence which he had failed to hear.
<p>        
        To this writing we now turn.
<p>        
        It must have been on the first of April that W. commanded P. (now 
        somewhat cowed) to enter the "temple" exactly at 12 o'clock  noon 
        on three successive days, and to write down what he should  hear, 
        rising exactly at 1 o'clock.
<p>        
        This he did.  Immediately on his taking his seat the Voice  began 
        its Utterance, and ended exactly at the expiration of the hour. 
<p>        
        These are the three chapters of Liber Legis, and we have  nothing 
        to add.
<p>        
             The full title of the book is, as P. first chose to name it,
<center>        
<br>                                LIBER AL vel LEGIS
<br>                                 sub figura CCXX
<br>                        as delivered by LXXVIII to DCLXVI
</center>        <br>
        and it is the First and Greatest of those Class A publications of 
        A.'.A.'.  of  which is not to be altered so much as the  style  of
a 
        letter.
<p>             This was the original title devised by 666 to appear in  the 
        1909  publication.  The "Key of it all" and the true spelling  of 
        Aiwass had not then been discovered.
