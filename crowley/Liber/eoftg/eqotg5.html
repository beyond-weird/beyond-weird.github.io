                            The Results of Recession.
</h4><hr><br>        
        The wisest of the Popes, on being shown some miracles, refused to 
        be  impressed, remarking that he did not believe in them, he  had 
        seen too many.  The result of the Meditation practices and  their 
        results,  following  those of Magick, was to give our  student  a 
        conception  of the Universe which was purely mental.   Everything 
        was  a  phenomenon  in mind.  He did not as  yet  see  that  this 
        conception  is self-destructive; but it made him skeptical,  and 
        indifferent to whatever happened.  You cannot really be impressed 
        by  anything which you know to be nothing more than one  of  your 
        own thoughts.  Any occurrence can be interpreted as a thought, or 
        as  a relation between two thoughts.  In practice this  leads  to 
        profound indifferentism, miracles having become commonplace.  But 
        what  would be the amazement of the priest who, placing the  Host 
        upon his tongue, found his mouth full of bleeding flesh !  At the 
        period of writing, it is evident for what purpose our student was 
        led  into  this state.  It was not to the Magician, not  to  the 
        mystic,  it  was to a militant member of  the  Rationalist  Press 
        Association  that  the great Revelation was to be made.   It  was 
        necessary  to  prove  to him that there was  in  actual  truth  a 
        Sanctuary, that there was in sober earnest a body of Adepts.   It 
        matters   nothing   whether  these  Adepts  are   incarnated   or 
        discarnated,  human or divine.  The only point at issue  is  that 
        there  should  be conscious Beings in possession of  the  deepest 
        secrets  of Nature, pledged to the uplifting of humanity,  filled 
        with  Truth, Wisdom and Understanding.  It is practical to  prove 
        the existence of individuals whose knowledge and power,  although 
        not complete--for the nature of Knowledge and Power is such  that 
        they  can never be complete, since the ideas  themselves  contain 
        imperfections--are yet enormously greater than aught known to the 
        rest of humanity.
<p>        
        It  was of such a body that our student had heard in  the  "Cloud 
        upon the Sanctuary" ; admission to its adyta had been the guiding 
        hope  of  his life.  His early attainments had tended  rather  to 
        shake  his belief in the existence of such an  organization.   He 
        had  not yet reckoned up the events of his life; he had not  yet 
        divined  the  direction  and  the  set  purpose  informing  their 
        apparently  vagrant  course.  It might have been by  chance  that 
        whenever  he  had been confronted with any difficulty  the  right 
        person  had  instantly come forward to solve it, whether  in  the 
        valleys  of Switzerland, the mountains of Mexico, or the  jungles 
        of the East.
<p>        
        At  this  period of his life he would have scouted  the  idea  as 
        fantastic.  He had yet to learn that the story of Balaam and  his 
        prophetic  ass  might be literally true.  For the  great  Message 
        that  came to him came, not through the mouth of any person  with 
        any  pretensions to any knowledge of this or any other sort,  but 
        through  an  empty-headed woman of society.  The plain  facts  of 
        this revelation must be succinctly stated in a new chapter.
