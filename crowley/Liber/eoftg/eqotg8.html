                              Summary of the Case.
</h4><hr><br>        
             In this revelation is the basis of the future Aeon.   Within 
        the  memory of man we have had the Pagan period, the  worship  of 
        Nature,  of  Isis,  of the Mother, of  the  Past;  the  Christian 
        period, the worship of Man, of Osiris, of the Present.  The first 
        period is simple, quiet, easy, and pleasant; the material ignores 
        the  spiritual;  the  second  is  of  suffering  and  death:  the 
        spiritual  strives to ignore the material.  Christianity and  all 
        cognate   religions  worship  death,  glorify  suffering,   deify 
        corpses.   The new Aeon is the worship of the spiritual made  one 
        with the material, of Horus, of the Child, of the Future.
<p>        
             Isis was Liberty; Osiris, bondage; but the new Liberty  is 
        that  of  Horus.   Osiris  conquered  her  because  she  did  not 
        understand  him.  Horuse avenges both his Father and his  Mother.  
        This  child Horus is a twin, two in one.  Horus  and  Harpocrates 
        are one, and they are also one with Set or Apophis, the destroyer 
        of  Osiris.  It is by the destruction of the principle  of  death 
        that they are born.  The establishment of this new Aeon, this new 
        fundamental  principle, is the great work now to be  accomplished 
        in the world.
<p>        
             FRATER  PERDURABO, to whom this revelation was made with  so 
        many  signs and wonders, was himself unconvinced.   He  struggled 
        against  it  for  years.  Not until the  completion  of  His  own 
        initiation at the end of I909 did he understand how perfectly  he 
        was  bound to carry out this work.  Again and again He  turned 
        away  from it, took it up for a few days or hours, then  laid  it 
        aside.   He even attempted to destroy its value, to  nullify  the 
        result.   Again  and again the unsleeping might of  the  Watchers 
        drove Him back to the work; and it was at the very moment when He 
        thought  Himself to have escaped that He found Himself fixed  for 
        ever with no possibility of again turning aside for the  fraction 
        of second from the Path.
<p>        
             The  history  of this must one day be told by a  more  vivid 
        voice.   Properly  considered,  it is  a  history  of  continuous 
        miracle.   Enough  if it is now said that in this  Law  lies  the 
        whole  future: it is the Law of Liberty, and those who refuse  it 
        proclaim  themselves slaves, and as slaves shall they be  chained 
        and  flogged.   It is the Law of Love, and those  who  refuse  it 
        declare  themselves  to be the children of hate, and  their  hate 
        shall  return  upon  them  and consume  them  with  its  unending 
        tortures.   It is the Law of Life, and those who refuse it  shall 
        be  subject to death; and death shall catch them unawares.   Even 
        their life shall be a living death.  It is the Law of Light,  and 
        those who refuse it thereby make themselves dark for ever.
<p>        
             Do  what  thou wilt shall be the whole of the  Law!   Refuse 
        this,  and fall under the curse of destiny.  Divide will  against 
        itself, the result is impotence and strife, strife-in-vain.   The 
        Law  condemns no man.  Accept the Law, and everything is  lawful.  
<p>
        Refuse the Law, you put yourself beyond its pale.  It is the  Law 
        that  Jesus Christ, or rather the Gnostic tradition of which  the 
        Christ-legend  is a degradation, attempted to teach;  but  nearly 
        every  word  he*1*  said was mininterpreted and  garbled  by  his 
        enemies,   particularly  by  those  who  called  themselves   his 
        disciples.   In  any  case the Aeon was not ready for  a  Law  of 
        Freedom.  Of all his followers only St. Augustine appears to have 
        got even a glimmer of what he meant.
<p>        
        A  further attempt to teach this law was made through Sir  Edward 
        Kelly  at  the  end of the sixteenth  century.   The  bondage  of 
        orthodoxy  prevented his words from being heard,  or  understood.  
        In many other ways has the spirit of truth striven with man,  and 
        partial  shadows of this truth have been the greatest  allies  of 
        science  and philosophy.  Only now has success been attained.   A 
        perfect  vehicle  was  found,  and the  message  enshrined  in  a 
        jewelled  casket; that is to say, in a book with  the  injunction 
        "Change  not  as much as the style of a letter."   This  book  is 
        reproduced  in  facsimile,  in  order  that  there  shall  be  no 
        possibility of corrupting it.  Here, then, we have an  absolutely 
        fixed and definite standpoint for the foundation of an  universal 
        religion.
<p>        
             We  have  the Key to the resolution of all  human  problems, 
        both philosophical and practical.  If we have seemed to labour
        at proof, our love must be the excuse for our infirmity ; for  we 
        know well that which is written in the Book:
<center>        
<h3>"Success is your proof."
</center>
<p>We  ask no more than one witness; and we call upon Time  to 
        take the Oath, and testify to the Truth of our plea. </p>
