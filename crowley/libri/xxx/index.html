<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0. Learn first - Oh thou who aspirest unto our ancient Order! - that 
Equilibrium is the basis of the Work. If thou thyself hast not a sure 
foundation, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature? </p>
<p>1. Know then, that as man is born into this world amidst the Darkness of 
Matter, and the strife of contending forces; so must his first endeavor be to 
seek the Light through their reconciliation. </p>
<p>2. Thou then who hast trials and troubles, rejoice because of them, for in 
them is Strength, and by their means is a pathway opened unto that Light. </p>
<p>3. How should it be otherwise, O man, whose life is but a day in Eternity, a 
drop in the Ocean of time; how, were thy trials not many, couldst thou purge thy 
soul from the dross of earth? </p>
<p>Is it but now that the Higher Life is beset with dangers and difficulties; 
hath it not ever been so with the Sages and Hierophants of the past? They have 
been persecuted and reviled, they have been tormented of men; yet through this 
also has their Glory increased. </p>
<p>4. Rejoice therefore, O Initiate, for the greater thy trial the greater thy 
Triumph. When men shall revile thee, and speak against thee falsely, hath not 
the Master said, &quot;Blessed art thou!&quot;? </p>
<p>5. Yet, oh aspirant, let thy victories bring thee not Vanity, for with 
increase of Knowledge should come increase of Wisdom. He who knoweth little, 
thinketh he knoweth much; but he who knoweth much has learned his own ignorance. 
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool, than of 
him. </p>
<p>6. Be not hasty to condemn others; how knowest thou that in their place, thou 
couldst have resisted the temptation? And even were it so, why shouldst thou 
despise one who is weaker than thyself? </p>
<p>7. Thou therefore who desirest Magical Gifts, be sure that thy soul is firm 
and steadfast; for it is by flattering thy weaknesses that the Weak Ones will 
gain power over thee. Humble thyself before thy Self, yet fear neither man nor 
spirit. Fear is failure, and the forerunner of failure: and courage is the 
beginning of virtue. </p>
<p>8. Therefore fear not the Spirits, but be firm and courteous with them; for 
thou hast no right to despise or revile them; and this too may lead thee astray. 
Command and banish them, curse them by the Great Names if need be; but neither 
mock or revile them, for so assuredly wilt thou be led to error. </p>
<p>9. A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inherited 
destiny; he is a part of mankind; his actions affect not only what he called 
himself, but also the whole universe. </p>
<p>10. Worship and neglect not, the physical body which is thy temporary 
connection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental 
Equilibrium be above disturbance by material events; strengthen and control the 
animal passions, discipline the emotions and the reason, nourish the Higher 
Aspirations. </p>
<p>11. Do good to others for its own sake, not for reward, not for gratitude 
from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long for thine 
ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. </p>
<p>12. Remember that unbalanced force is evil; that unbalanced severity is but 
cruelty and oppression; but that also unbalanced mercy is but weakness which 
would allow and abet Evil. Act passionately; think rationally; be Thyself. </p>
<p>13. True ritual is as much action as word; it is Will. </p>
<p>14. Remember that this earth is but an atom in the universe, and that thou 
thyself art but an atom thereon, and that even couldst thou become the God of 
this earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, that thou wouldst, even then, 
be but an atom, and one amongst many. </p>
<p>15. Nevertheless have the greatest self-respect, and to that end sin not 
against thyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully to 
reject truth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge pander not to thy 
prejudices. </p>
<p>16. To obtain Magical Power, learn to control thought; admit only those ideas 
that are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and contradictory 
Idea that presents itself. </p>
<p>17. Fixed thought is a means to an end. Therefore pay attention to the power 
of silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the outward expression 
of thy thought, and therefore hath it been said that &quot;the thought of foolishness 
is sin.&quot; Thought is the commencement of action, and if a chance thought can 
produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do? </p>
<p>18. Therefore as hath already been said, Establish thyself firmly in the 
equilibrium of forces, in the centre of the Cross of the Elements, that Cross 
from whoses centre the Creative Word issued in the birth of the dawning 
Universe. </p>
<p>19. Be thou therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity 
and caprice; be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid 
irritability and ferocity; be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, 
but avoid idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, 
but avoid grossness and avarice. </p>
<p>20. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself 
to command the Spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to 
pander thine avarice, thou wouldst no longer command them, but they would 
command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the pure beings of the woods and mountains to 
fill thy coffers and satisfy thy hunger of Gold? Wouldst thou debase the Spirits 
of Living Fire to serve thy wrath and hatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of 
the Souls of the Waters to pander thy lust of debauchery? Wouldst thou force the 
Spirits of the Evening Breeze to minister thy folly and caprice? Know that with 
such desires thou canst but attract the Weak, not the Strong, and in that case 
the Weak will have power over thee. </p>
<p>21. In true religion there is no sect, therefore take heed that thou 
blaspheme not the name by which another knoweth his God; for if thou do this 
thing in Jupiter thou wilt blaspheme YHVH and in Osiris YHShVH. Ask and ye shall 
have! Seek, and ye shall find! Knock, and it shall be opened unto you!</p>
