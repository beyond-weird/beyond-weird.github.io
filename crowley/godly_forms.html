<h2>Skill Of the adoption Of the godly Forms</h2>

<p>The adoption of godly forms is the extremely 
important element of different magic rituals, in which are used 
invokatsii. Assuming the form of the corresponding god or godly 
means, magician connects his personal consciousness with the aspect of
his highest (godly genius) harmonious, with respect to nature of the 
called forces now magic operation is accomplished no longer only force
of the personal will of magician, but also by power and by the 
authority of the deity, with whom identifies himself the magician. 

<p>About the adoption of the godly forms Of alister Of krouli
it tells in <i>Liber O</i>. I lead 
the appropriate quotations from this book with the explanatory 
commentaries: 
<p><b></b><b>"1. It is necessary to thoroughly study the magic 
images of Egyptian gods. This can be made in any public museum 
or according to those books, which are accessible to student. 
Then it must diligently draw them from the nature and on the 
memory ".</b> 
<p><b></b>Why Krouli does accentuate attention precisely in the gods
of ancient Egypt? Certainly, ancient-Egyptian deities widely are
used in the telemitskom pantheon. But reason not only in this. 
Egyptian skill was more dogmatic than, for example, the skill of
ancient Greece or Rome. The images of Egyptian gods were created
according to strict rules. The pose of deity, proportion, the 
forms of its body and clothing were strictly defined, and no retreats 
from the canon be it could. In Russia the best Egyptian 
collections are represented in the museum of the depictive skills of 
the name of Pushkin (Moscow) and in the hermitage (Saint Petersburg). 
Specifically, for student it there is worthwhile to find the 
image of god, whose form it is intended to accept, to study and to 
memorize it. 
<p><b></b><b>"2. Student, after accepting the pose of "god" or 
any other pose, characteristic for the selected god, must imagine, as 
its means gradually it coincides with its own body or wraps it. 
In this it is necessary to practice until it will be possible to
completely master the craftsmanship of creation and identification 
with the means and with god himself. 
<br>To the enormous regret, there exists no simple and specific 
testing in order to verify, they will reach in this practice the 
success ".</b> 

<p><b></b>The adoption of godly form is accomplished as follows: 
shut eyes, and then with internal sight visualize the means of 
god before you on the astral plan. It must be enormous size, 
that is raised in the total increase. Then give the color, 
characteristic for this deity, to godly form. (it you can easily
find in <i>Liber 777</i> Alistera Of 
krouli. For example, for the goddess Of khatkhor (Venus) is 
characteristic green color, etc.). You follow the fact in order 
to thoroughly recreate all details of the extrinsic ethos of god. 


<p>Then you will create the sign of entering (sign, which 
opens gates into the peace of magic) and, after taking one step 
forward, enter into the godly form. 

<p>To judge, how successfully is accepted godly form really 
is difficult. Nevertheless, in the opinion of some magicians, 
evidence of success is the unusual feeling of internal force and 
power, which covers a participant in the operation. 

<p><b></b><b>"3. The vibration of godly names as further means of
the identification of human consciousness with that its clean part, 
which men are called the name of what or from the gods. Act as 
follows: 
<p>4. ("a") arise, after extending hands. ("cm." 
illustration.) 
<br>("b") make a nose deep inhalation, after representing in this 
case, that the name of god enters in you together with the 
respiration. 
<br>("c") make it possible to this name to slowly go down downward 
from the lungs to the heart, the solar interlacement, the navel, the 
sex organs, and so to the very soles of feet ".</b> 

<p><b></b>Vibrate godly name one should several times, 
simultaneously visualizing the godly form, which wraps your sensual 
sphere (aura). Identify itself with the god. You do not 
hurry. Merge with the god, uniting your consciousness with the 
consciousness of deity. Then, completely, how this is possible, 
you will imagine itself by this god and assume godly form. (as 
examples of some godly forms they can serve the sacred signs of 
degrees, described Krouli in the journal <i>"equinox"</i>). 

<p><b></b><b>"with the realization of both of those mention aboveed 
practitioner the realization of anything, besides form and name of god
must be absolutely destroyed; and the longer it will be required
time in order to return to the normal perception, the better "</b>, he writes in the conclusion Of krouli. 

<p>To in proper time leave all godly forms, which started 
during the ritual, is so important, to how and in proper time accept 
them. Magician to the equal degree must know how to preserve by 
normal and healthy his personal "4" and to know how this "4" to extol,
to raise to the godly level. If we in proper time not "remove" 
from themselves all godly forms accepted, there is a big enough risk 
to obtain psychological disorder or to develop in itself megalomania. 

<p>The following sequence of actions is recommended for the 
output of godly form: 

<p>1. Shut eyes. By internal sight again you will
be connected by several instants with the godly form, which you 
previously accepted. Create the means of deity, who wraps your 
sensual sphere (aura) again. You will turn attention to all 
details, colors and other special features of godly form. 

<p>2. Make one step back, leaving from the means. 
Making this, cease to identify itself with the godly form 
completely, after separating itself from the means. 

<p>3. Make a sign of silence, and remain in this 
position, until you scatter means. Again represent god, who is 
raised before you, by internal sight. Slowly visualize, as godly
form gradually it is scattered and grows dim, until finally it 
disappears.
