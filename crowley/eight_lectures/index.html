<p><font face="Times New Roman">Aleister Crowley has achieved the reputation of 
being a master of the English language. This book which is as fresh and vibrant 
today as when it was penned over thirty years ago demonstrates this fact. It 
shows how impossible it is to categorize him as a particular kind of stylist. At 
turns he can be satirical, poetical, sarcastic, rhetorical, philosophical or 
mystical, gliding so easily from one to the other that the average reader is 
hard put to determine whether or not to take him at face value. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">His description of mystical states of 
consciousness clarifies what tomes of more erudite writing fails to elucidate. 
It is in effect a continuation of Part I of Book 4 brought to maturity. Nearly 
three decades had elapsed between the writing of these two books, in which time 
his own inner development had soared ineffably. A great deal of what he has to 
say may seem prosaic at first sight, but do not be fooled by this. Other of his 
comments are profound beyond belief, requiring careful and long meditation if 
full value is to be derived from them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is not a book to be read while standing or 
running. It is a high water mark of Crowley's literary career, incorporating all 
that we should expect from one who had experimented with and mastered most 
technical forms of spiritual growth. There is humor here, a great deal of 
sagacity, and much practical advice. This book cannot be dispensed with for the 
student for whom Yoga is 'the way.' </font></p>
