<p>&quot; Receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. &quot; So
wrote the great apostle nearly two thousand years ago; and surely in these latter days,
when Satan seems visibly loosed upon earth, the words have a special and dreadful
significance even for us who&#151;thanks be to God for His unspeakable mercy ! -- are
washed in the blood of the Lamb and freed from the chains of death&#151;and of hell.
Surely this terrible history is a true Sign of the Times. We walk in the last days, and
all the (v) abominations spoken of by the apostle are freely practised in our midst. Nay !
they are even the boast and the defence of that spectre of evil, Socialism. The awful
drama which the unhappy wretch who penned these horrible utterances has to unfold is alas
! too common. Its study may be useful to us as showing the logical outcome of Atheism and
Free Love. For the former, death; for the latter, the death-in-life of a frightful,
loathsome, shameful disease. &quot;Receiving in themselves that recompense of their error
which was meet&quot;. It may seem almost incredible to many of us, perhaps safely
established in our comfortable cures, among a simple and Godfearing people, that any man
should have been found to pen the disgusting blasphemies, the revolting obscenities, which
defile these pages. Nor can it be denied that a certain power of expression, even at times
a certain felicity of (vi) phrasing&#151;always, indeed, a profound dramatic
feeling&#151;is to be found in these poems. Alas ! that we should be compelled to write
the words ! That an art essentially spiritual, an art dignified by the great names of
Gascoigne Mackie, Christina Rossetti, Alfred Tennyson, George Herbert, should here be
prostituted to such &quot; ignoble use&quot;. Truly the corruption of the best is the
lowest&#151;corruptio optimi pessima. Nor can one gleam of Hope, even in the infinite
mercy of our loving Father, tinge with gold the leprous gloom of our outlook. These clouds
without water have no silver lining. The unhappy man need not have feared that the poor
servants of God would claim him as repentant, though surely we would all have shed the
last drop of our blood to bring him to the grace of God. Alas ! it was not to be. The
devilish precautions of this human fiend excluded all such possibilities. He died as he
had lived, no doubt. Alas! no doubt. (vii) Where is now that spotted soul ? There is but
one appalling answer to the question. In the &quot;place prepared for the devil and his
angels &quot;; for &quot; he that believeth not is condemned already &quot;. Not even in
that modern evasion, the plea of insanity, can we find any hope. Nothing is clearer than
that these wretched victims of Satan were in full possession of their faculties to the
last moment. Surely the maniacal violence of their unhallowed lust and hate is no ground
for pity but for reprobation. When our blessed Lord was on earth He made no excuses for
those who were possessed of devils. He took this simply as a fact&#151;and He healed them.
It is only the shocking atheism and materialism of modern science that, in an insane
endeavour to whittle away the miracles of our blessed Saviour, has sought to include

&quot;possession&quot; in the category of disease. (viii) Our Lord had no doubts as to the
reality of demoniacal possession; why should we, His humble servants, truckle to the
Christless cant of an atheistical profession? The facts of this shocking case are familiar
enough in the drawing-rooms of the West End. Both the characters in the story were persons
of considerable education and position. On this account, and because a statement of the
truth (however guarded) would have compromised persons of high rank, and was in any case
too disgusting to publish in the press, the tragedy has not&#151;one is glad to say in
these days of yellow prurience&#151;become matter for public comment. But the wife of the
man, driven to drink and prostitution by the inhuman cruelty of his mistress&#151;this
modern worse than Lucrezia Borgia or Mdme de Brinvilliers&#151;and the fiance of the girl
betrayed and ruined by her machinations, still haunt the purlieus of the (ix) Strand, the
one an unfortunate of the lowest order, the other a loafer and parasite upon the ghouls
that traffic in human flesh and shame. Thus we see evil reproducing itself, spreading like
an incurable cancer throughout society from one germ of infidelity and unhallowed lust. I
may perhaps be blamed for publishing, even in this limited measure, such filthy and
blasphemous orgies of human speech (save the mark) but I am firmly resolved (and I believe
that I have the blessing of God on my work) to awake my fellow-workers in the great
vineyard to the facts of modern existence. Unblushing, the old Serpent rears its crest to
the sky; unashamed, the Beast and the Scarlet Woman chant the blasphemous litanies of
their fornication. Surely the cup of their abominations is nigh full ! Surely we who await
the Advent of our blessed Lord are emboldened to trust that this frenzy (x) of wickedness
is a sure sign of the last days; that He will shortly come&#151;whose fan is in His hand,
wherewith He shall thoroughly purge His floor&#151;and take us His saints&#151;however
failing and humble we may be&#151;to be with Him in His glory for ever and ever, while
those who have rejected Him burn in eternal torment, with wailing and gnashing of teeth,
in that Lake of Fire and Brimstone from which&#151;thank God ! He in His infinite mercy
hath delivered us. But until that happy day we are bound to work on silently and
strenuously in His service. May the perusal of these atrocious words enlighten us as to
the very present influence of Satan in this world&#151;naked and unashamed. May it show us
the full horror of the Enemy with whom we are bound to fight; may it reveal his
dispositions, so that under our great Captain we may again and again win the Victory. It
is my prayerful hope that He who turn (xi) evil to good may indeed use to His glory even
this terrible and wicked book. It has cost me much to read it; to meditate on it has been
a terrible shame and trial; to issue it, much against my own poor human judgment, in
obedience to His will, has been a still harder task; were it permitted me to ask a
recompense, I would ask none but that of His divine blessing upon my fellow-labourers in
His great field. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>King of myself, I labour to espouse An equal soul. Alas ! how frail I find The golden
light within the gilded house. Helpless and passionate, and weak of mind! Lechers and
lepers! -- as all ivy cling, Emasculate the healthy bole they haunt. Eternity is pregnant;
I shall sing Now&#151;by my power&#151;a spirit grave and gaunt Brilliant and selfish,
hard and hot, to flaunt Reared like a flame across the lampless west, Until by love or
laughter we enchaunt, Compel ye to Kithairon&#146;s thorny crest&#151;Evoe ! Iacche !

<p>Look! Look! upon the tripod through the smoke Of slain things kindled, and fine
frankincense. Look&#151;deep beyond the phantoms these evoke Are sightless halls where
spirit stifles sense. There do I open the old book of Fate Wherein They pictured my
delight and me Flushed with the dawn of rapture laureate And leaping with the laughter of
ecstacy. Mine eyes grow aged with that hieroglyph Of doom that I have sought : the fatal
end. That which is written is written, even if Great Zeus himself&#151;great Zeus ! --
were to befriend. Even in the spring of the first floral kiss : &quot;No happy end the
gods have given for this &quot;. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>II </b></font></p>

<p>Save death alone ! I see no happy end, No happy end for this divine beginning. Child !
let us front a fate too ill to mend, Take joy in suffering for the sake of sinning. Ay !
from your lips I pluck the purple seed Of that pomegranate sleek Persephone Tasted in hell
; the irrevocable deed I do, and it is done. Naught else could be For us, the chosen of so
severe a god To act so high a tragedy, the elect To suffer so, and so rejoice, the rod And
scourge of our own shame, the gilt and decked Oxen that go to our own sacrifice At our own
consecrated shrine of vice. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>III </b></font></p>

<p>Over the desert ocean of distress We reach pale eager hands that quiver and bleed With
life of these our hearts that surge and stress In agony of the meditated deed. For in the
little coppice by the gate Wherein I drew you shy and sly, and kissed Your lips, your
hushed &quot;I love you&quot; smooth and straight Sweeping to wrap us in the glittering
mist Of hell that holds us&#151;even there I heard The lacerating laugh of fate ring out,
The dog-faced god pronounce the mantic word, And saw the avengers gather round about Our
love. The Moirae neither break nor bend; The Erinyes hunt us to&#151;no happy end. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IV </b></font></p>

<p>Our love is like a glittering sabre bloodied With lives of men ; upsoared the sudden
sun ; The choral heaven woke ; the aethyr flooded All space with joy that you and I were
one. But in the dark and splendid dens of death Arose an echo of that jewelled song :
There swept a savour of polluted breath From the lost souls, the unsubstantial throng That
tasted once a shadow of our glory And turn them in the evil house to adore The godhead of
our sin, the tragic story We have set ourselves to write, the sombre score Our daggers
carve with poesy sublime Upon the roof tree of despair and crime ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>V </b></font></p>

<p>As we read Love and Death in either&#146;s eyes, We see the cool mild splendour of the
dawn Damned by some tragic throw of murderous dice To slash like lightning over lea and
lawn Jagged and horrible across the curtain Of heaven, writing ruin, ruin&#151;we see Our
certain joy marred with a doubly certain Soul-shattering anguish.&#151;Bah ! To you and me
Such loathing, such despair are little things. We are afloat on the flood-tide of
lust&#151;A lust more spiritual than life, that stings Till death and hell dissolve
i&#146; the aftergust. So ? But the Gods avert their faces, bend Their holy brows, and
see&#151;no happy end. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VI </b></font></p>

<p>Thus shall men write upon our cenotaphs : &quot; Traitor and lecher ! murderous and
whore ! &quot; The rat-faced god that lurks in heaven laughs; There is rejoicing on the
immortal shore. The angels deem us hurled form the above, Burnt out of bliss, blasted from
sense and thought, Barred from the beauties of celestial love And branded with the
annihilating Naught. O ! pallid triumph ! empty victory ! When we sit smiling on the
infernal thrones Starred with our utmost gems of infamy, Builded with tears, and cushioned
with the groans Of these the victims of our joys immense&#151;Child ! I aspire to that bad
eminence ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VII </b></font></p>

<p>Hell hath no queen ! But, o thou red mouth curving In kisses that bring blood, shall I
be alone? What of the accomplice of these deeds unswerving? Will not your dead hot kisses
match mine own? As here your ardours brand me bone and marrow Biting like fire and poison
in my veins, Shall you not there still ply your nameless harrow. Mingle a cup from those
our common pains To intoxicate us with an extreme pleasure Keener than life&#146;s, more
dolorous than death&#146;s Till these infernal blisses pass the measure Of heaven&#146;s
imagined by the tremulous breaths Or silly saints and silly sinners, swaying From scraps
of blasphemy to scraps of praying? </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VIII </b></font></p>

<p>You love me ? trite and idle word to darken (With all its glow) the splendour of our
sun ! No soul of heaven or hell may hearken The unbearable device that we have done. Nor
may Justine nor Borgia understand Nor Messalina nor Maria guess The infernal chorus
swelling darkly grand That echoed us our everlasting &#145; Yes ! &#145; Nor shall the
Gods perceive to damn or praise The deed that shakes their essence into dust, Disrupts
their dreams, divides their dreary days. Supreme, abominable, rides our lust Armed in the
panoply of brazen youth And strength, since, if we are Hell&#146;s, Hell&#146;s worm is
Truth. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IX </b></font></p>

<p>We are still young enough to take delight In wickedness for wickedness&#146; sole sake.
Eve did not fall because she knew aright The fruit an apple, but the snake a snake. Nor
shall we sink among the foolish throng That seek an end, but rise among the few Who do the
strong thing because they are strong And care not why they do, so that they do. Therefore
we wear our dread iniquity Even as an aureole therefore we attain Measureless heights of
nameless ecstasy, Measureless depths of unimagined pain Mingled in one initiating kiss
That those dissolve in the athanor of this. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>X </b></font></p>

<p>We tread on earth in our divine disdain And crush its blood out into purple wine,
Staining our feet with hot and amorous stain, The foam involving all the sensual shrine Of
love whose godhead dwells upon your mouth Wherein the kisses clustering overflow With
brimming ardour of the new sin&#146;s growth Till round us all the poisonous blossoms
blow, And all the cruel things and hideous forms Of night awake and revel in our revel,
While in us rage the devastating storms Whose dam is Luxury and their sire the devil... It
is well seen, however things intend, The Gods have given for this&#151;no happy end. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XI </b></font></p>

<p>Crown me with poppy and hibiscus ! crown These brows with nightshade, monkshood and
vervain ! Let us anoint us with the unguents brown That waft our wizard bodies to the
plain Where in the circle of unholy stones The unconsecrated Sabbath is at height ; Where
the grim goat rattling his skulls and bones Makes music that dissolves the dusk of night
Into a ruddy fervour from the abyss Such as I see (when cunning can surprise Our Argus foe
and give us leave to kiss) Within your deep, your damned, your darling eyes. Ay ! to the
Sabbath where the crowned worm Exults, with twisted yard and slime-cold sperm. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XII </b></font></p>

<p>There gods descend ; there devils rise. We dance, Dance to the madness of the waning
moon, Write centuries of murder in a glance, Chiliads of rape in one unearthly tune. There
is the sacrament of sin unveiled And there the abortion of Demeter eaten, The potion of
black Dione distilled, The measure of Pan by whirling women beaten. These are but symbols,
and our souls the truth ; These sacraments, and we the gods of them ; The sabbath incense
curls to us to soothe Our spleen, engarlands us, a diadem For that unutterable deed that
hurled Us, flaming thunderbolts ! against the world. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIII </b></font></p>

<p>There needs not ask the obscure oracle Whereto these dire imaginations tend. We read
this sigil in the dust of Hell : &quot; The Gods have given for this no happy end. What
end should we desire, who grasp the gain We have despoiled from everlasting time, Who
gather sunshine from the iciest rain And turn the dullest prose to rhythm and rime? Think
you we cannot warm our hands and laugh Even at the fire that scatheth adamant? Think you
we shall not knead the utmost chaff Into a bread worth Heaven&#146;s high sacrament And
from the bitter dregs of Hell&#146;s own wine Distil a liquor utterly divine ? </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIV </b></font></p>

<p>Behold ! I have said. The destiny obscure Of this our deed obscure we shall not skry.
We know &quot; no happy end ! &quot;&#151;but we endure, Abiding as the Pole Star in the
sky. You mix your life in mine&#151;then soul in soul We shoot forth, meteors, travelling
on and on Far beyond Space to some dark-glimmering goal Where never sun or star hath risen
or shone ; Where we shall be the evil light beyond time, Beyond space, beyond thought,
supreme in deathless pang ; Nor shall a sound invade that hall of crime, Only the champing
of the insatiate fang Of the undying worm our love, fast wed Unto&#151;no happy end.
Behold ! I have said. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Love is sore wounded by the dragon shame, O maiden o&#146; mine ! its life in jets of
blood Languidly ebbs. I see the gathering flame Aspire&#151;expire. I see the evil flood
Of time roll even and steady over it, Bearing our God to the accurst ravines ; Bearing our
God to the abysmal pit Whence never a God may rise. The wolfish queens Of earth have set
their faces stern and sour Against us ; we are bidden to cease&#151;to cease ! Ha ! how

sleeping, when the dawn conceals Its earliest glimmer and our blood abates Awhile its tide

flaming like the dawn when kiss for kiss Passed and for ever sealed our bale and bliss. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

that pale vase that Proserpina filled From wells of her sad garden, cold and clear And
something overbitter and oversweet ? Or in the rout of Dionysus did Some Bassarid prophesy

shrine : Nepenthe, amaranth, vervain, myrrh and moly Are deathless blooms about our chaste
design. Not you resisting, but myself refraining, Gives us the eternal spring, the elixir
rare, That mage and sage have sought, and uncomplaining Never attained. We found it early

shed, One gesture of your body limber and lithe, One smile&#151;the sudden white, the
abiding red ! Then&#151;should one slander you in idiot verse By speaking of the subtle
seven-fold sweetness Your lips can answer me, all fate to amerce In one mad kiss in all
its mad completeness ? O Gods and Muses ! give me grace for this To match my wine for

divine Exists ! Impossible ! no mortal yet Suffered such bliss from the all-envious gods ;
Whence we may guess we are immortal, set From the beginning over the periods Of ages, set
on thrones of jasper and pearl, Wreathed with the lilies of Eternity, While on our brow
the starry clusters curl Like flashes from the sunkissed jewelry, Dew on the flowers our

you and I are half-intoxicated (I hid the heart of madness in my verse) Therewith, like
Maenads ready to be mated Before the Lord of bassara and thyrse. Yea ! we are lifted up !
Crested Kithairon Shakes his black mane of pines, and roars for prey. Heave all his

<p>To drink one drop thereof is to be drunk. The firm feet stagger, and the world spins
round; The fair speech stammers&#151;nature&#146;s God hath sunk Into some trivial place
of the profound. But he who is drunk thereon is wholly sane, Being wholly mad ; he moves
with space-wide wings Sees not a world&#151;engulphed in the inane ! Nor needs a voice for
speech, because he sings. What then of them who are most drunk together As you and I are,
mystic maiden o&#146; mine, Beyond Dionysus and his tedious tether, Beyond Kithairon and
his topmost pine? Why, even now I am drunk who scribble amiss These lines, not

Hunger as I, rejoice as I, withdraw Into the same far transcendental sky Of this initiated
rapture. Hurt Of shame for me is past, beholding Gods Only a little part of me, and dirt
Such as men fling and women paste, no odds. Moreover, by the subtle and austere Vintage we
drain, albeit we drain the lees, There is no headache for the morning drear, No fluctuant

lesser to the greater sins Up to the throne where sits the royal and rare Vision of Pan. O

Lamenting through the dreary day there dance Anaemic thoughts ; the bruised and bloodless
heart Beats as if tired of life, as I am tired Who all these days have never seen your
face, Nor touched the body that my soul desired, Nor have inhaled the perfume of the place
That you make sweet&#151;black dogs of doubt and fear Howl at my heels while care plies
whip and spur, Driving me down to the dull damned dead sphere Where is no sight or sound
or scent of Her Our Lady Dian, but where hag and witch Hecat bestrides her broom&#151;the
bestial bitch ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Like to a country in the interdict Whose folk lack all the grace of eucharist, My heart
is ; all the pangs its foes inflict Are naught to this unutterable mist Of absence. Where
s the daily sacrament, The glad devouring of your body and blood, Sweet soul of Christ, my
Lola ? I am rent Even as the demons from the face of God When they would peer into
beatitude. I am barred from the incalculable bliss, The unutterable chrism, the soul s
food, Of you, your gaze, your word, your touch, your kiss O Gods, Fates,
Fiends&#151;whoever plays the Pope ! Lift up your curse&#151;leave me not without hope ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>III </b></font></p>

<p>My soul is like the savage upland plains Of utmost wretchedness in Tartary. No strength
of sun, no fertilizing rains ! Only a bitter wind, intense and dry, Cuts over them. Hardly
the memory stands Of one who travels there ; his pain forgets The golden bliss of all
those other lands Where he was happy. So the blizzard frets Its sterile death across my
soul, and chills All hope of life even from the rare sad seeds It blows from sunnier vales
and happier hills, Though at the best they be but worthless weeds. I stand&#151;I scan the
infinite horizon Of hopeless hope&#151;yet I must travel on. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IV </b></font></p>

<p>When for an hour we met (to call it meeting Barred by the bleak ice of society From
even the lover s glance, the lover s greeting. The intonation that means ecstasy !) One
ray of saddest gladness lit the dusk : This&#151;that I saw you pale and suffering, A
goddess armed with myrrh instead of musk, With lips too cold to pray, too dry to sing. For
by that sigh I knew the adorable Truth, that you wept in secret over me. Your silence was
the dumb despair of hell ; Who read it right read love. Strange cruelty, That who would
die for you, sweet murderess, Should find his comfort in your bitterness ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>V </b></font></p>

<p>For there you sat, you smiled, you chatted on, Myself alone perceiving the keen cold
Sword at your heart, the speechless malison That trembled on your tongue, the while it
trolled Its senseless clamour of necessary wit, And woke the senseless necessary laughter,
The senseless necessary reply to it, The long sad silly commonplace thereafter. Suppose we
had risen, as quick as thought, and stood And caught and kissed&#151;what could the storm
have done Worse than this sickening fog of solitude ? Who can do worse than take away the
sun ? They better had take care, I think. One day We shall go mad, and take ourselves
away. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VI </b></font></p>

<p>Yet we may hope ; for this, and not from fear, We kept our counsel ; we may hope anon
To turn the corner of the evil year And find a brave new springtide coming on. Meanwhile
by stealth I may invoke your shade And clasp you to me, though it be a dream Or little
more, a vision from the Maid That rules by Phlegethon&#146;s sepulchral stream. Nay ! it
is more : by magic art compel (My soul !) my maiden s body to appear Visible, tangible,
enjoyable Even to the senses of the amorous seer, Whose demon ministers through the gulphs
and glooms Convey his mistress on their meteor plumes. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>More, I will visit you, forlorn who lie Crying for lack of me ; your very flesh Shall
tingle with the touch of me as I Wrap you about with the ensorcelled mesh Of my fine body
of fire : oh ! you shall feel My kisses on your mouth like living coals, And piercing like
an arrow of barbed steel The arcane caress that shall unite our souls. Till, when I see
you next, I shall have doubt Whether your pallor be from love distressed Or from the
exhaustion of the age-long bout Of love you had of me upon your breast Held hard all
night, with mouths that never ceased To engorge love s single sacramental feast. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>One writes, and all is easy. Drop the pen, And Paradise is blotted out ! The earth,
Fair as it seemed, becomes a hideous den, And all life&#146;s promises of little worth.
Like to a mother whose one child is dead, I wander, aching for the sight, the sound. The
touch&#151;familiar, now inhibited. The child is under ground&#151;is under
ground&#151;The child is under ground&#151;who comforts her ? The bastard fool her priest
? The useless clod Her husband ? The accursed murderer Her God ? -- if so be that she hath
a God. Foul curses from my life&#146;s envenomed flood Break in a vomit of black foam and
blood. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>As one entranced by dint of cannabis, Whose sense of time is changed past recognition,
Whether he suffer woe or taste of bliss, He loses both his reason and volition. He says
one word&#151;what countless ages pass ! He walks across the room&#151;a voyage as far As
the astronomer&#146;s who turns his glass On faintest star-webs past the farthest star And
travels thither in the spirit. So It seems impossible to me that ever The sands of our ill
luck should run so low That splendidly success should match endeavour ; Yet it must be,

<p>To-morrow is the day when Christ our Lord Rose from the dead ; therefore, the shops are
shut. Men may get drunk, or syphilized, or bored, Robbed, murdered, or regenerated, --
but, But they must not get letters, be amused, Or do a thing they want to do till Monday ;
Whence comes the universally-diffused And steady popularity of Sunday. And yet I grumble !
any other day I might receive a message from my Lola : &quot; The siege is raised. Meet me

<p>Were you a shop-girl and myself a clerk, Things might be better&#151;we could surely
meet With due umbrellas in the dripping Park And decorously spoon upon a seat. This is the
penalty one pays for rank And fortune ! Ah, my Lola, I am dying And mad&#151;or would God
play me such a prank As to dictate such verse while you are crying ? Let me too weep, weep
on ! weep out my soul, Weep till the world of sense was wept away And, dead, I reached you
at the glimmering goal Whither you had outrun me ! Weep, I say, Weep! It is better. Thus

<p>Wherefore I duly invoke the God Of Tears that he may mingle yours and mine, Water
therewith Life&#146;s unresponsive sod, And raise therefrom some sickly growth of vine
Whose grape shall yield a bitter draught of woe Fit for the assuaging of a deadlier thirst
Than Attis knew or Abelard : even so I suffer ; than some lovely nun accurst Who beats her
breast upon the convent bars, Even so you suffer : let its draught restore All lovers
(that invoke the sad cold stars) Unto good luck : then you and I once more (Though still
we were forbidden word and kiss) Might find a certain happiness in this. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>For truth it is, my maiden, we have had Already more than our fair share of pleasure.
The good god Dionysus ivy-clad Hath poured us out a draught of brimming measure. Let us
then rather give the lustiest praise Our throats can sound than pray for further favour ;
Even though our sorrow, eating up our days, Devour us also. Gods enjoy the savour Of
Man&#146;s thanksgivings ; from their holy place Beholding mortals, they are wroth to see
Tears; they rejoice to see a proud glad face Master of itself and of eternity. Let us,
reflecting on how dear we love, Shew laughter and courage to the gods above ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

the Aeon : We love each other ! let them meditate Awhile on that glad cry, and you will
see How they consult, and smile, and hint to fate That none can mar so holy a destiny. We
love each other ! loud and glad ; let heaven And all the gods be deafened ! Sing, O sing !
We love each other! through the storm-cloud riven Let the wild anthem of our triumph ring

<p>Then the Lord answered me out of the wind Out of the whirlwind did He answer me; Gird
up thy loins now like a man, and find If thou canst answer like a man to Me! Who art thou
darkening counsel by thy word, And in thine ignorance accusing Them Who, ere thy prayer
was formulated, heard And crowned it with its passion&#146;s diadem ? Who is the Son of
Man, that We should mind him ? Or visit the vain virgin of his pleasance ? Yet ever as we
went We stood behind him And compassed her with Our continual presence ? From the black
whirlwind the most high God sayeth : Why did ye doubt, o ye of little faith ? </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>I answer Thee out of the utmost dust. I am a worm, I abase myself, I cry Against myself
that I am found unjust More than all they that dwell beneath the sky. I do repent, I do
lament, o Thou Who hast watched over us and cared for us, Beating i&#146; the dust this
consecrated brow, And answer Thee in broken murmur thus, That I am altogether base and
vile, That Thou art altogether good and great, That Thou hast given the guerdon grace for
guile Even while I lifted up myself to Fate And cursed Thee. And from me who scorned to
pray Thou hast rolled the sad sepulchral stone away. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>On this wise ; that by uttermost good Fortune I met you walking out in London city,
Even when from Heaven I did not dare importune Hardly to pass your house ! The Gods took
pity They whirled us in a chariot of fire About the highest heavens for many an age ! So
Regent&#146;s Park may seem to hot desire ; So the archangel gets a cabman&#146;s wage ;
So all the aeons that pass still leave one time To take one&#146;s lunch at the appointed
hour&#151;This is the difference between prose and rime And this the great gulf fixed for
leaf and flower. The British public grunts and growls and grovels, Swilling its hogwash of
neurotic novels. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IV </b></font></p>

<p>We knew enough to wake to choral rapture All answering Nature : I will swear the sun
Came out ; you saw the moulting trees recapture Their plumage, and the green destroy the
dun. Nothing could jar ; the British workman took A kindly interest in our kind caresses ;
The loafing nursemaid and the musing cook Agreed with us entirely. Love impresses Its seal
upon the world ; is skilled to wake The sympathy of everything that lives. Kindliness,
flows, not venom, from the snake ; The trodden worm dies duly&#151;but forgives The cabman
asked four shillings for the job, And almost boggled at my glad ten bob ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>V </b></font></p>

<p>Oh ! it was rapture and madness once again To turn our tears to kisses brimming over
The mouths that never were too wide and fain For lover to hold intercourse with lover. Ah
! we were owls of dusk to doubt the light, Bats to mistrust the Wolf&#146;s tail&#146;s
holy warning : &quot; Sorrow endureth maybe for a night, But joy must surely cometh in the
morning &quot;. Joy, ay ! what joy poured straight from the high treasure, The
inexhaustible treasure of delight The gods have poured us, pouring overmeasure Because we
love with all our life and might. Believe me, it is better than all prayers To show the
gods our love surpasses theirs ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VI </b></font></p>

<p>Nay, even thus you could not credit Fate, Even in my arms close cuddled as you lay With
hard-shut eyes and lips inebriate With their own kisses all this happy day. Nay, but
blaspheming you put hope aside, Bade me forget you, swore yourself a liar, Smiled through
the words because you knew you lied Knew that&#151;what waters can put out our fire ? So
we amused ourselves with cunning brisk Careful arrangements to forget each other. You cut
that love-curl from your neck at risk Of comment&#151;at the slightest&#151;from your
mother. You gave it me&#151;God forget me, dear girl, When I forget to treasure up that
curl!</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Your loveliness should help me to forget you ; Your murmurous &quot; I love you &quot;
like soft bees Humming should help ; although my kisses fret you, They are intended but to
give you ease, And help you to forget me ; then, the fixed Ardent intentness of my
cat-green eyes Flecked with red fire is like a potion mixed Straight out of Lethe, or
divination lies. If there be truth in augury, your lips Fastened to mine should be a
certain spell To put your memory of me in eclipse : -- In short, if all be true that sages
tell, Two days of absence with roast beef and beer Will cure me of you perfectly, my dear

<p>Why did you play with such ungracious folly ? Because our passion is too bitter-sweet ?
Because the acute and maddening melancholy Is stronger than the rapture when we meet ?
Because you weep beyond your own control Like to one wounded bleeding inwardly ? Because
you are not the mistress of your soul Mighty enough to master fate and me ? It cuts me to
the heart to see the brine Not falling from your bad bewitching eyes, To feel you are
weeping in the central shrine Whose woes the peristyle may not surprise. I want to treat
you as a lover rather ; You make me lecture to you like a father ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Write in you heart, dear maid, that Hitherto The Lord hath helped us. Give him duly
praise (As I have given Him for making you). Pray not, ask not for wealth and length of
days Or even for wisdom, lest one day you find That you are saddled with some thousand
grooms (You bear the case of Solomon in mind !) All in frock-coats and helmeted (with
plumes) -- A scarcely pleasant prospect ! Just give thanks O Lord, for what we have
received, Amen ! And then if Jordan overflows his banks, Our vines increase, and one seed
turns to ten, Keep on thanksgiving ! Even if things go wrong, Howls are less pleasant to
the ear than song. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

other. Were we to part for ever, breast from breast, Now, even now, there would not be
another In all the earth that should not envy aright With plenty cause our short-lived
happiness. No life can hold one half-an-hour&#146;s delight Such as we had&#151;this
morning ! Why then, bless, Bless all that lives and moves and hath its being ! Bless all
the Gods, without omitting one ! Bless all the company of heaven, agreeing To veil their
fires to our stupendous sun ! Bless all the lesser glories that excite In the great
gladness of our mother light ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

But what has happened once may happen again, And &quot; Hitherto the Lord hath helped us

Evermore the Lord will help us. &quot; Fear And sorrow are folly ; you must sleep o&#146;

slip the tether And all the world before us deep and wide Gape like the abyss, through

of common love should be unsealed, And we be caught within the common mesh That catches
common folk. O God ! bite hard ! Smite down rebellious flesh with hideous pain ! Bite hard

<p>You are a devil gloating on the pain You suffer and I suffer ; you laugh shrill Over
the pangs of those pale fools, the twain Whom we deceive, whom we shall surely kill
Whispering a word of this. Ah ! joy it is That false to faith is all the honied pressing;
A traitor triumphs in each stolen kiss, Caligula and Cressida caressing. You love yourself
for stealing me away From the proud lovely wife ; you love me more That in my arms a
prostitute you lay, And to your troth-plight lover played the whore When mouth to mouth we
clung, and breath for breath Exchanged the royal accolade of death. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

blood glittering a diadem Upon your dazzling brows ; my blood I see Sucked deep into your
body, curling round Like fire in every artery and vein Massed in your heart, colossal and
profound. I am mad for you to brand me with the stain Of your own vice. Our souls, a
murdering crew Of itching Mullahs, wallow, dervish-drunk. Love surges at the pang ! Our
poisonous dew Of sweat and kisses blinds us. A mad monk Kissing fanatically the cross that

She will not bend To lift you from your seas of bitter foam ! Nay ! wrap yourself and rub
yourself in silk ! Drink of my blood, engorge my fruitless sperm ! For you were suckled on

Follow Iacchus while the sunset pales ! Revel it on the flower-enamelled grass While the
moon lasts ; then plunge in trackless woods ! Slay beasts unheard-of and blaspheming kings
! Mingle in madness with strange sisterhoods ! Dare black Aornos with Daedalian wings !
All words ! words ! there&#146;s a hunger to express The infinite pangs, the infinite
mighty blisses Stored in the house of rapture and distress Whose key is one of our
blood-tainted kisses Whose fume arises from the accursed sod Where we lie burning and

<p>So in this agony of enforced silence The sober song breaks to a phrenzied scream ; The
shattering brain admits the mad god&#146;s violence, And wild things course as in an evil
dream : Devils and dancers, druid rites and dread, Horrible symbols scarred across the
sky, Invisible terrors of the quick and dead, Impossible phantoms in mad revelry Conjoined
in spinthriae of bestial form, Human-faced toads, and serpent-headed women, All lashed and
slashed by the all-wandering storm Caricature of all things holy and human -- -- Such are
the discords that absolve the strain As this wild threnody dissolves the brain. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Forgive me, o my holy and happy maid, Lola, sweet Lola, for the imagination Of all
things monstrous that your soul dismayed Reads on the palimpsest of my elation. Simple and
sweet and chaste our love is ever, And these its wild and mystic characters That rage and
storm in impotent endeavour To unveil our glory to our worshippers. Lola, dear Lola,
mystic maiden o&#146; mine, Let us not mingle with the ribald rout That throng our temple.
Close, Palladian shrine, With our reverberate glory rayed about ! Abide within&#151;with

<p>Though I adorn my thought with angel tresses Or pluck its pallium from the demon-kings,
My spirit rests at ease in your caresses, And cares not for the song, so that it sings.
Life is but one caress, one song of gladness, One infinite pulse of love in tune with you
; One infinite pulse, upsoaring into madness, Down sinking to content. O far and few The
stars that follow our lofty pilgrimage Into the abyss of silence and delight Beyond the
glamour of the world, the age, The illusions of the light and of the night. Wherefore

hawk that towers sublime Into the great abyss, with icy gaze Fronting the calm immensities
of time And making space to shudder ; so I praise With infinite contempt the joyous world
That I have figured in this brain of mine. The sails of this life&#146;s argosy are furled

<p>Wrapped in the wool of wizardry I sit ; Mantled in mystery ; the little things That I
have made through weariness of wit, Stars, cells, and whorls, all wonder in their wings !
These Gods and men, these laws, these hieroglyphs And sigils of my fancy seem to spire In
worship up mine everlasting cliffs I built between my will and my desire. They reach me
not ; I made a monstrous crowd, Innumerable monuments of thought, But none is equal ; this
high head is bowed In vain to the wise God it would have wrought, Had not&#151;Who sitteth
on the Holy Throne Thereby must make himself to be alone. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>III </b></font></p>

<p>See ! to be God is to be lost to God. That which I cling to is my proper essence ; Nor
is there aught at any period That may endure the horror of my presence. I conjure up dim
gods ; how frail and thin ! How fast they slip from this appalling level ! This is the
wage of the fellatrix Sin Drunk on the icy death-sperm of the Devil. I were a maniac did I
contemplate The outward glory and the inward terror, Sick with the hideous light myself
create From the dark certainty of gloom and error. For I am that I am&#151;behold ! this
&#145;I&#146; Hath nothing constant it may measure by. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IV </b></font></p>

<p>Should I take pleasure in the fond perfume That curls about my altars ? in the throats
That chant my glory in the decent gloom Of lofty ministers ? Shall the blood of goats And
bulls and men send up a fragrant steam To me, who am ? Shall shriek of pythoness Or wail
of augur move this dreadful dream To some less melancholy consciousness ? I have created
men, who made them gods Of their own excrements, and worshipped them. I cannot match these
calculating clods Who twist themselves a faecal diadem From all the thorny thoughts that
plague them most ; Break wind, and call upon the Holy Ghost. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>V </b></font></p>

<p>Yet I abide; for who is Pan is all. He hath no refuge in deceitful death. What soul is
immanent may never fall; What soul is Breath can never fail of breath. The pity and the
terror and the yearning Of this my silence and my solitude Are broken by the blazing and
the burning Of this dread majesty, this million-hued Brilliance that coruscates its jetted
fire Into the infinite aether ; this austere And noble countenance set fast in dire And
royal wrath, this awful face of fear Before whose glance the ashen world grows grey,
Crashes, and chaos crumbles all away. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VI </b></font></p>

<p>As when the living eyes of man behold The embalmed seductions of a queen of Khem
Wrapped with much spice and linen and red gold And guardian gods on every side of them ;
Yet inasmuch as life is life, they shrink, Shrivel and waste to ashes as men gaze : So
doth the world grow giddy at the brink Of these unfathomable eyes, that blaze Swifter and
deadlier than storms or snakes. Then&#151;o what wonder, as I strain afar The basilisk
flame ! -- what breathless wonder wakes That I behold unsinged a silver star O joy ! O
terror ! O ! -- O can it be There is a thing that is, apart from me ? </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VII </b></font></p>

<p>I travelled, so the star. We neared ; we saw Each other, knew each other ; in your face
Mine equal self with majesty and awe Abode ; and thus we stayed for a great space. What
was the manner of our countenance? I saw you seated, as a great lost God With blasphemy
exulting in your glance And horror at your lips ; my soul was shod With glory, and your
body bathed in glory, So that from out the uttermost abyss The very darkness churned
itself to hoary And phosphor foam of agony and bliss. The authentic seal of our majestic
might Stamped on the light in light the light of light. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VIII </b></font></p>

<p>So presently, most solemnly and slowly, Our fingers touched and caught ; our lips
reached forth And with conscious purpose smote their holy Lives into one, and loosed their
common wrath. Unto the ends of our dead universe Their frenzy rolled ; henceforth no
prince or power Should lift the sterile strength of that one curse Even to bring one
thought to birth one hour. For now we knew ; &quot; it is a lonely thing To sit supreme
upon the single throne ; &quot; But being come thus far, goes glittering : &quot; It is a
lovely thing to be alone ! &quot; Silence ! Beware to speak the fatal word That might
inweave our two-ply with a third ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IX </b></font></p>

<p>Wherefore again in sexless sanctity The mighty lingam rears its stilled sublime ; The
mighty yoni spreads its chastity Against the assaulting gods of space and time. Rather be
Phoedra than Semiramis ! I will deny you, though you doom to dare To abdicate, and risk
the spirit kiss In the embraces of the wanton air. Why should we cast our crowns to gods
unborn ? Why yield our bleeding garlands till the hour When to ourselves we seem a shame
and scorn And seek some craft to span a statelier power ? Not for a while evoke that
sombre spell ! The present still exceeds the possible. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>That is his truth that seems to sink supine Into your bosom&#146;s bliss, the scented
snare, Killed by your kisses shuddering in his spine And blinded in the bowers of your
hair ! This is his truth, who seems to writhe and sob Beneath the earthquake pangs of your
caress, Whose heart burns out in one volcanic throb, Whose life is eaten up of nothingness
This is his truth, and yours, that seem to be Mere beauteous bodies gripped in epicene And
sterile passion, all unchastity In being chaste, all chaste in our obscene And sexless
mouthings, that repugnant roll Their bestial billows on the snow-pure soul. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XI </b></font></p>

<p>This is our truth, that only Nothing is, And Nothing is an universe of Bliss ; That
loves denote supernal ecstasies, And saintship lurks in the colossal kiss. Loves are the
letters of the holy word That contradicts the curse &quot; Let Being be ! &quot; Since all
things, even one thing, are absurd ; And no thing is the utmost ecstasy. Kisses induct the
soft and solemn tune That Israfel shall blow on Doomisday&#151;Your silky eyes are blue as
that pale moon (For ere it dies it sickens into grey) That witches see, whose eager
violence Aborts the gods of cosmic permanence. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>The uninstructed and blaspheming man Looks on the world and sees it void and base. Let
him endure its horror as he can ! There is no help for his unhappy case. The love-taught
magus, the hermaphrodite, Knows how to woo the Mother, and awake her ; Beholding, in the
very self-same sight, The self-illumined image of the Maker. I love, and you are wise ;
our spirits dance A merry measure to the music moving In waves through that mirific
brilliance. Will you first tire of wit, or I of loving ? Tire ? O thou sea of love, thy
ripples run Into themselves, to my serener sun ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIII </b></font></p>

<p>For you I built this faery dome of words And crowned it with the cross of my desire. I
circled it with songs of blessed birds And cradled all in the celestial fire. The stars
enfold it ; the eternal sun And moon give light ; nor clouds nor rain intrude ; Only the
dews of Dionysus run In this intoxicating solitude. I have begemmed its marble flame of
spires With jewels from the bliss of God, and set Chryselephantine columns curled like
fires Below each misty opal minaret. Is there no window to the east ? Behold The eyes of
Love, your love, the essential gold ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIV </b></font></p>

<p>For me therein shall you erect a statue Even as you know me with the mystic eyes
Hungrily, hungrily a-gazing at you, Afeast upon our strange sad ecstasies. Make me the
aching mouth parched-up with blisses The lips curled back, the breath desiring you, The
whole face fragrant with your full free kisses, The soul thereof exhaling scented dew Born
in the utmost world where we in truth Abide like Bacchus with a Bassarid Drunk with our
art, love, beauty, force and youth ; But place that head upon a pyramid Of snaky
lightnings, lest&#151;but that shall be Always a secret between you and me. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>Or, an you will, evoke me as the Sphinx With lion&#146;s claws, bull&#146;s breast, and
eagle&#146;s wings ! You are my riddle, and the answer sinks Below the deep essential base
of things, Rises above the utmost brim of thought And bubbles over as impatient song. Yet
&quot; We are one &quot; is all, and all is naught ; And this one &quot; one &quot;, and
&quot; all &quot;, and &quot; naught &quot; The whole content of our imagining, [shall
throng The great arcanum in the adytum hid From men, and though we carve or kiss or sing,
The Sphinx is dumb, and blind the Pyramid.&#151;Now our affairs are ordered perfectly.

with his fervour, fain Too woo with sores your turbid arteries And kiss black ulcers in
your spotted brain ? We married close, my Lola, with a kiss : -- Now for the lifelong
lover, Syphilis ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IV </b></font></p>

<p>Yea ! but we love. We win. The body&#146;s curse Is bitter, but he hath not won the
whole. There&#146;s more than life in this brave universe. Death cannot touch the secret
of the soul ! Nor shall we shrink, although this further pang Strike through the liver
with its fiery dart, The hope&#151;the horrid hope&#151;whose gleaming fang Now stirs, a
serpent&#146;s, underneath your heart ! For lo ! not vainly we invoked the god That
looseneth the girdle of a maid ; Even now draws nigh the dreadful period That maketh all
the mother-world afraid. With rotten fruit your belly is grown big&#151;Thanks to the
bastard god that cursed the fig ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>V </b></font></p>

<p>Your swollen neck is grown a swollen breast Gushing with poisoned milk; your breath is
caught In quick sharp gasps ; you get nor sleep nor rest, The monster moving in you in his
sport. Surely a monster ! some unnatural thing, Some Minotaur of shame, no egg of pride To
hatch the miniature of love and spring In your own image, subtly glorified. White swan you
were ! not Zeus but Cerberus Hath ravished you ; you brood on harpy eggs&#151;Sweet sister
! is the wine too sour for us ? We have drunk deep&#151;nay ! nay ! but to the dregs ! And
all their bitterness is braver brew Than the dull syrup of the pious crew. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VI </b></font></p>

<p>Still we can laugh at burgesses and churls In our excess of agony and lust. We pity
these poor prudes, insipid girls And tepid boys, these creatures of the dust. We pity all
these meal-mouthed montebanks That prate of Jesus, ethics, faith and reason, These
jerry-built dyspeptics, stuccoed cranks, Their lives one dreary plain, one moist dull
season Like their grey land. O costive crapulence ! They ache and strain within the
water-closet Of church and State, their shocked bleat of offence : &quot; This poet&#146;s
life was such a failure &quot;. Was it ? Fools ! our worst boredom was a loftier thrill
Than all you ever felt&#151;or ever will. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VII </b></font></p>

<p>If we are weary, it is flesh that faints. We cannot bear such worlds of happiness. Even
in this torture that consumes and taints, We writhe in bliss, one terrible caress Of the
great Gods of Hells. Ah ! surely, dear, Our way is wise, transcending human woe : We are
most happy and of great good cheer. What do we know ? It matters not. We know. This is
enough, that we have slain the Sphinx, Worked out her wizardry, dissolved her doom ; And
though her wine be death to him that drinks We shall carouse for ever in the tomb. We
drank bull&#146;s blood ; and all our pangs immense Are better than eupeptic innocence. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>VIII </b></font></p>

<p>Ah ! if flesh fails, may we not also fail ? May not the vulture liars gather round Our
death-beds, and drone out their dismal tale With drawl and whine, the Galilean sound Of
snuffle and twang ? May not their stinking souls Interpret our last sighs as penitence
When we close up the coruscating scrolls Of our life&#146;s joy, seal up the jar of sense
To broach the starry flagon&#151;splendid spilth ? These creeping cravens shall be
circumvented ; They shall not belch their flatulence and filth On us, or tell the world
that we repented. Come, as we strained it, let us break the tether In the last
luxury&#151;to die together ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>IX </b></font></p>

<p>Let Death steal softly through the gate of sleep On tiptoe ! win away the maiden life
On velvet pinions to his azure steep ; At ease, at peace, to woo her for a wife ! His
white horse waiting quietly without Let him push gently the delicious door And take us. We
have lived. How should we doubt Or fear ? we have lived well. For ever more We must be
well. The cypress cannot daunt, Nor the acacia thrill ; we are content To wonder in the
shadowy groves, to haunt The dark delight of our own element ; Or&#151;could we send a
messenger&#151;to tell Our brothers of the happiness of Hell ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>X </b></font></p>

<p>Are not the poppy-fields one snowy flame ? Come, let us wander hand in hand therein,
Straining with joyous juice our lips of shame, Draining their bitter draught of sterile
sin ! Are not the eyes of sleep already dull, The lashes drooping over their desire ? Are
not the gods awaiting to annul With Lethe the last flicker of the fire ? Ay, let us kiss,
my darling ; let us twitch For the last time the flesh against the flesh, Before the
coming of the lovely witch That shall excite our sleepy souls afresh, Anointing us with
subtle drugs and suave, Fit for the grave, for love beyond the grave ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XI </b></font></p>

<p>For the last time, my Lola ! Still the name Fills me with music, echoing afar Faint,
like the rapture of some ghostly flame Rejoicing in some lone secreted star Beyond the
visible heaven. Come to me ! Come closer ! Is not this as close as death ? Are we not one
to all eternity Jewelled with joy ? Mix me your subtle breath Into the words well-known
and never worn, Into the kiss well-kissed and never tired, Into the love well-loved and
not forlorn, The love beyond all that ever was desired ? Ay ! all the cloudy must of life
is strained To clearer liquor that our souls attained. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XII </b></font></p>

<p>How the yahoos will rage and rave about Our sloughs ! &quot; Appalling double suicide !
&quot; &#145;Orrible detiles &quot;. In the world without We never yet consented to abide.
What should we care, within this cave of bliss, This ocean of content, wherein we dive And
play like dolphins, for the horrid hiss Of blow-flies ? Nay, they never were alive ! O the
sweet sleep that fastens on these brows ! O the enchauntment of this dreamy god, My mystic
sister, my mellific spouse, That shepherds us with his hermetic rod Into the flowery folds
of love and sleep Where we have strayed&#151;O never yet so deep ! </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIII </b></font></p>

<p>Lola, dear Lola, how the stillness grows ! How drowsy is the world, that folds her
wings Over us, folding like a sunset rose Her crimson raptures to the night of things !
How all the voices and the visions fail As we pass through into the silent hall Beyond the
vapours and beyond the veil, Beyond the Nothing as beyond the All ! Ah ! then, our voice
must also fail in this ; Our symbols are but shadows in the sun ; Love&#146;s self springs
from the shadow of the kiss ; Our bliss ! O, that was hardly half begun ! We fight the
Fate as we have fought the foemen. The poison takes us. -- {Chi-chi-iota-rho-epsilon-tau-
epsilon Nu-iota-chi-omega-mu- epsilon-nu} </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b></p>

<p>XIV </b></font></p>

<p>Farewell ! O passionate world of changeful hours ! Come, Lola, let us sleep ! Elysian
groves Await us and the beatific bowers Where Love is ours at last&#151;as we were
Love&#146;s. Come, with our mouths still kissing, with our limbs Still twined, relax the
ecstasy ! pass by To the abyss of night where no star swims ! On to the end beyond the
prophecy ! Ah Lola mine ! &quot; No happy end is this &quot;&#151;I love you&#151;ah ! you
love me&#151;you love me ! For we have passed beyond imagined bliss Into the kingdom of
reality, Where we are crowned with flowers&#151;yet closer creep ! Sleep, Lola, now ! I
love you&#151;sleep&#151;ah, sleep !</p>

<p>THE INITIATION </p>

<blockquote>

  </b></font><p>III. This shocking sonnet awakes pity and disgust in equal
  proportions. If even then they had only turned to the &quot; Great Physician ! &quot; But
  no ! &quot; God hardened Pharaohs heart &quot;. </p>
  <p>IV. 14. Alas ! no doubt that the reference is to our blessed Lord and Master, The
  barren fig-tree has been no doubt a stumbling-block to many weak souls. But the fig tree
  has here a </p>
  <p>deeper signification in its reference to certain loathsome forms of disease, and it is
  a symbol of lust. See Rosenbaum&#146;s &quot; Plague of Lust &quot; </p>

  <p>V. 1. Swollen neck.&#151;A superstition of the ancients was that the neck swelled on
  the bridal night, and virginity was tested by the proportion of the skull and the neck.
  See Beverland &quot; Draped Virginity &quot;. </p>
  <p>VI. Poor, poor deluded victims of Satan ! If they only knew the holy joy of even the
  least of Jesu&#146;s lambs! </p>
  <p>VII. 13. Bull&#146;s blood.&#151;Supposed to be a poison by the ancients. Thus
  Themistocles is said to have died. </p>
  <p>IX. 9. Cypress&#151;Symbol of death. </p>

  <p>10. Acacia&#151;Symbol of resurrection. </p>
  <p>X. 1. The poppy-fields.&#151;They killed themselves with laudanum. </p>
  <p>XII. 1. Yahoos.&#151;See Swift&#146;s Voyage to Laputa. It is to be feared that the mad
  Dean intended to satirize mankind, the race for which the Lord of Glory died ! </p>
  <p>XIII. {Chi-chi-iota-rho-epsilon-tau-epsilon Nu-iota- chi-omega-mu-epsilon-nu} Rejoice,
  we conquer. It is very extraordinary how Satan&#146;s blindness and fury possess them to
  the very end. Even as they died, maybe one fervent cry of repentance to the dear Saviour
  of all men would have been heard, and the gates of Paradise swung open as Satan, cheated
  of his prey, sank yelling into the Pit. But alas ! there is no such word : nothing but a
  pagan Epicureanism even in the jaws of death. </p>

  <p>A Prayer </p>
  <p>Merciful and loving Father, almighty God, grant unto us Thy humble servants and
  ministers a double portion of Thy Spirit that our eyes may be opened to the wickedness of
  them that love Thee not, that by Thy grace our ministrations may be used to bring them out
  of darkness into Light, by the virtue of our crucified Lord, risen and ascended. Thine
  only-begotten Son, in Whose name we ask this Thy blessing. For Jesus Christ&#146;s sake,
  Amen.</p>
