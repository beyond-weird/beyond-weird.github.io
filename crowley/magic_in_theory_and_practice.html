Thrill with lissome lust of the light,
O man! My man!
Come careering out of the night
Of Pan!  Io Pan!
Io Pan!  Io Pan! Come over the sea
From Sicily and from Arcady!
Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards
And nymphs and satyrs for thy guards,
On a milk-white ass, come over the sea
To me, to me,
Come with Apollo in bridal dress
(Shepherdess and pythoness)
Come with Artemis, silken shod,
And wash thy white thigh, beautiful God,
In the moon of the woods, on the marble mount,
The dimpled dawn of the amber fount!
Dip the purple of passionate prayer
In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,
The soul that startles in eyes of blue           {V}
To watch thy wantonness weeping through
The tangled grove, the gnarled bole
Of the living tree that is spirit and soul
And body and brain --- come over the sea,
(Io Pan!  Io Pan!)
Devil or god, to me, to me,
My man! my man!
Come with trumpets sounding shrill
Over the hill!
Come with drums low muttering
From the spring!
Come with flute and come with pipe!
Am I not ripe?
I, who wait and writhe and wrestle
With air that hath no boughs to nestle
My body, weary of empty clasp,
Strong as a lion and sharp as an asp ---
Come, O come!
I am numb
With the lonely lust of devildom.
Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,
All-devourer, all-begetter;
Give me the sign of the Open Eye,
And the token erect of thorny thigh,
And the word of madness and mystery,
O Pan!  Io Pan!
Io Pan!  Io Pan Pan!  Pan Pan! Pan,
I am a man:
Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,
O Pan! Io Pan!
Io Pan!  Io Pan Pan!  I am awake
in the grip of the snake.
The eagle slashes with beak and claw;
The gods withdraw:
The great beasts come, Io Pan!  I am borne
To death on the horn
Of the Unicorn.
I am Pan!  Io Pan!  Io Pan Pan!  Pan!              {VI}
I am thy mate, I am thy man,
Goat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god,
Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to equinox.
And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend
Everlasting, world without end,
Mannikin, maiden, Maenad, man,
In the might of Pan.
Io Pan!  Io Pan Pan!  Pan!  Io Pan!

{Illustration on page VIII described:
   This is the set of photos originally published facing page 12 in EQUINOX I,
2 and titled there:  "The Signs of the Grades."

These are arranged as ten panels:     * * * *
                                        * *
                                       *   *
                                         *
                                         *

   In this re-publication, the original half-tones have been redone as line cop
y.  Each panel consists of an illustration of a single human in a black Tau rob
e, barefoot with hood completely closed over the face.  The hood displays a six
-pointed figure on the forehead --- presumably the radiant eye of Horus of the
A.'. A.'., but the rendition is too poor in detail.  There is a cross pendant o
ver the heart.  The ten panels are numbered in black in the lower left corner.

The panels are identified by two columns of numbered captions, 1 to 6 to the le
ft and 7 to 10 to the right.  The description is bottom to top and left to righ
t:

"1. Earth: the god Set fighting."  Frontal figure. Rt. foot pointed to the fore
 and angled slightly outward with weight on ball of foot.  Lf. heel almost touc
hing Rt. heel and foot pointed left.  Arms form a diagonal with body, right abo
ve head and in line with left at waist height.  Hands palmer and open with fing
ers outstretched and together.  Head erect.

"2. Air: The god Shu supporting the sky."  Frontal.  Heels together and slightl
y angled apart to the front, flat on floor.  Head down.  Arms angled up on eith
er side of head about head 1.5 ft. from head to wrist and crooked as if support
ing a ceiling just at head height with the finger tips.  The palms face upward
and the backs of the hands away from the head.  Thumbs closed to side of palms.
  Fingers straight and together.

"3. Water: the goddess Auramoth." Same body and foot position as #2, but head e
rect.  Arms are brought down over the chest so that the thumbs touch above the
heart and the backs of the hands are to the front.  The fingers meet below the
heart, forming between thumbs and fingers the descending triangle of water.

"4. Fire: the goddess Thoum-aesh-neith."  Frontal.  Head and body like #3.  Arm
s are angled so that the thumbs meet in a line over the brow.  Palmer side faci
ng.  Fingers meet above head, forming between thumbs and fingers the ascending
triangle of fire.

"5,6. Spirit: the rending and closing of the veil."  Head erect in both.  #5 ha
s the same body posture as #1, except that the left and right feet are counterc
harged and flat on the floor with the heels in contact.  Arms and hands are cro
oked forward at shoulder level such that the hands appear to  be clawing open a
 split veil --- hands have progressed to a point that the forearms are invisibl
e, being directly pointed at the front.  Lower arms are flat and horizontal in
the plain of the image.
#6. has the same body posture as #1, feet in same position as #5.  The arms are
 elbow down against abdomen, with hands forward over heart in claws such that t
he knuckles are touching.  Passing from #5 to #6 or vice versa is done by motio
n of shoulders and rotation of wrists.  This is different from the other sign o
f opening the veil, the Sign of the Enterer, which is done with hands flat palm
 to palm and then spread without rotation of wrists.

"7-10. The L V X signs."

"7. + Osiris slain --- the cross." Body and feet as in #2.  Head bowed.  Arms d
irectly horizontal from the shoulders in the plane of the image.  Hands with fi
ngers together, thumbs to side of palm and palmer side forward.  The tau shape
of the robe dominates the image.

"8. L Isis mourning --- the Svastica."  The body is in semi-profile, head down
slightly and facing right of photograph.  The arms, hands, legs and feet are po
sitioned to define a swastika.  Left foot flat, carrying weight and angled towa
rd the right of the photo.  Right foot toe down behind the figure to the left i
n the photo.  Right upper arm due left in photo and forearm vertical with finge
rs closed and pointing upward. Left arm smoothly canted down to the right of th
e panel, with fingers closed and pointed down.

"9. V Typhon --- the Trident."  Figure frontal and standing on tip toe, toes fo
rward and heels not touching.  Head back.  Arms angled in a "V" with the body t
o the top and outward in the plain of the photo.  Fingers and thumbs as #7, but
 continuing the lines of the arms.

"10. X Osiris risen --- the Pentagram."  Body and feet as in #7.  Head directly
 frontal and level.  Arms crossed over heart, right over left with hands extend
ed, fingers closed and thumb on side such that the palms rest on the two opposi
te shoulders.}

   "Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of Natural P
hilosophy, advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understand
ing of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents being applie
d to proper Patients, strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced.
Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because
 of their skill, know how to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shal
l seem to be a miracle."

                 "The Goetia of the Lemegeton of King Solomon."

 "Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulterated form, it is assum
ed that in nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably without
the intervention of any spiritual or personal agency.
   Thus its fundamental conception is identical with that of modern science; un
derlying the whole system is a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order
and uniformity of nature.  The magician does not doubt that the same causes wil
l always produce the same effects, that the performance of the proper ceremony
accompanied by the appropriate spell, will inevitably be attended by the desire
d results, unless, indeed, his incantations should chance to be thwarted and fo
iled by the more potent charms of another sorcerer.  He supplicates no higher p
ower: he sues the favour of no fickle and wayward being: he abases himself befo
re no awful deity.  Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, is by no mean
s arbitrary and unlimited.  He can wield it only so long as he strictly conform
s to the rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws of nature as conce
ived by {IX} him.  To neglect these rules, to break these laws in the smallest
particular is to incur failure, and may even expose the unskilful practitioner
himself to the utmost peril.  If he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is a c
onstitutional sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exac
t conformity with ancient usage.  Thus the analogy between the magical and the
scientific conceptions of the world is close.  In both of them the succession o
f events is perfectly regular and certain, being determined by immutable laws,
the operation of which can be foreseen and calculated precisely; the elements o
f caprice, of chance, and of accident are banished from the course of nature.
Both of them open up a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to him who kn
ows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs that set in motion th
e vast and intricate mechanism of the world.  Hence the strong attraction which
 magic and science alike have exercised on the human mind; hence the powerful s
timulus that both have given to the pursuit of knowledge.  They lure the weary
enquirer, the footsore seeker, on through the wilderness of disappointment in t
he present by their endless promises of the future: they take him up to he top
of an exceeding high mountain and shew him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling
mists at his feet, a vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be, but radi
ant with unearthly splendour, bathed in the light of dreams."

 Dr. J. G. FRAZER, "The Golden Bough"."

   "So far, therefore, as the public profession of magic has been one of the ro
ads by which men have passed to supreme power, it has contributed to emancipate
 mankind from the thraldom of tradition and to elevate them into a larger, free
r life, with a broader outlook on the world.  This is no small service rendered
 to humanity.  And when we remember further that in another direction magic has
 paved the way for science, we are forced to admit that if the black art has do
ne much evil, it has also been the source of much good; that if it is the child
 of error, it has yet been the mother of freedom and truth."

                        -------------


 This book is for

                             ALL:
for every man, woman, and child.
   My former work has been misunderstood, and its scope limited, by my use of t
echnical terms.  It has attracted only too many dilettanti and eccentrics, weak
lings seeking in "Magic" an escape from reality.  I myself was first consciousl
y drawn to the subject in this way.  And it has repelled only too many scientif
ic and practical minds, such as I most designed to influence.
   But
                             MAGICK
is for
                              ALL.
   I have written this book to help the Banker, the Pugilist, the Biologist, th
e Poet, the Navvy, the Grocer, the Factory Girl, the Mathematician, the Stenogr
apher, the Golfer, the Wife, the Consul --- and all the rest --- to fulfil them
selves perfectly, each in his or her own proper function.
   Let me explain in a few words how it came about that I blazoned the word
                            MAGICK
upon the Banner that I have borne before me all my life.
   Before I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose nu
mber is 666.  I did not understand in the least {XI} what that implied; it was
a passionately ecstatic sense of identity.
   In my third year at Cambridge, I devoted myself consciously to the Great Wor
k, understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being, free from the
constraints, accidents, and deceptions of material existence.
   I found myself at a loss for a name to designate my work, just as H. P. Blav
atsky some years earlier. "Theosophy", "Spiritualism", "Occultism", "Mysticism"
, all involved undesirable connotations.
   I chose therefore the name.
                           "MAGICK"
as essentially the most sublime, and actually the most discredited, of all the
available terms.
   I swore to rehabilitate
                            MAGICK
to identify it with my own career; and to compel mankind to respect, love, and
trust that which they scorned, hated and feared.  I have kept my Word.
   But the time is now come for me to carry my banner into the thick of the pre
ss of human life.
   I must make
                             MAGICK
the essential factor in the life of
                             ALL.
   In presenting this book to the world, I must then explain and justify my pos
ition by formulating a definition of
                             MAGICK
and setting forth its main principles in such a way that
                             ALL
may understand instantly that their souls, their lives, in every relation with
every other human being and every circumstance, depend upon
                             MAGICK
and the right comprehension and right application thereof.

I. "DEFINITION."

                            MAGICK
is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.

{XII}

   (Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my
knowledge.  I therefore take "magical weapons", pen, ink, and paper; I write "i
ncantations" --- these sentences --- in the "magical language" i.e. that which
is understood by the people I wish to instruct; I call forth "spirits", such as
 printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them to convey
my message to those people.  The composition and distribution of this book is t
hus an act of
                             MAGICK
by which I cause changes to take place in conformity with my Will>)

II. "POSTULATE."

   ANY required Change may be effected by the application of the proper kind an
d degree of force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper
object.
   (Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold.  I must take
the right kind of acid, nitro-hydrochloric and no other, in sufficient quantity
 and of adequate strength, and place it, in a vessel which will not break, leak
, or corrode, in such a manner as will not produce undesirable results, with th
e necessary quantity of Gold: and so forth.  Every Change has its own condition
s.
   In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possibl
e in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into t
in, or create men from mushrooms.  But it is theoretically possible to cause in
 any object any change of which that object is capable by nature; and the condi
tions are covered by the above postulate.)

III. "THEOREMS."

 (1) Every intentional act is a Magical Act.>
   (Illustration: See "Definition" above.)               {XIII}
   (2) Every successful act has conformed to the postulate.
   (3) Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have
 not been fulfilled.
 (Illustrations: There may be failure to understand the case; as when a doctor
makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatment injures his patient.  There may be f
ailure to apply the right kind of force, as when a rustic tries to blow out an
electric light.  There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as wh
en a wrestler has his hold broken.  There may be failure to apply the force in
the right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of the Bank
.  There may be failure to employ the correct medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci
 found his masterpiece fade away.  The force may be applied to an unsuitable ob
ject, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut.)
   (4) The first requisite for causing any change is through qualitative and qu
antitative understanding of the conditions.
   (Illustration: The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of one'
s own True Will, or of the means by which to fulfil that Will.  A man may fancy
 himself a painter, and waste his life trying to become one; or he may be reall
y a painter, and yet fail to understand and to measure the difficulties peculia
r to that career.)
   (5) The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability to s
et in right motion the necessary forces.
   (Illustration: A banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situation, yet l
ack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take advantage of it.)
   (6) "Every man and every woman is a star."  That is to say, every human bein
g is intrinsically an independent individual with his own proper character and
proper motion.
 (7) Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on the self, and
partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each.  Anyone who
is forced from his own course, either through not understanding himself, or thr
ough external opposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe, a
nd suffers accordingly.    {XIV}
   (Illustration: A man may think it his duty to act in a certain way, through
having made a fancy picture of himself, instead of investigating his actual nat
ure.  For example, a woman may make herself miserable for life by thinking that
 she prefers love to social consideration, or "vice versa".  One woman may stay
 with an unsympathetic husband when she would really be happy in an attic with
a lover, while another may fool herself into a romantic elopement when her only
 true pleasures are those of presiding at fashionable functions.  Again, a boy'
s instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parents insists on his becoming
 a doctor.  In such a case, he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in medicin
e.)
   (8) A Man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting his
strength.  He cannot hope to influence his environment efficiently.
   (Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in no condition to un
dertake the invasion of other countries.  A man with cancer employs his nourish
ment alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is part of himself.  H
e soon fails to resist the pressure of his environment.  In practical life, a m
an who is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong will do it very clums
ily.  At first!)
   (9) A man who is doing this True Will has the inertia of the Universe to ass
ist him.
   (Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that the indiv
idual should be true to his own nature, and at the same time adapt himself to h
is environment.)
   (10) Nature is a continuous phenomenon, though we do not know in all cases h
ow things are connected.
   (Illustration: Human consciousness depends on the properties of protoplasm,
the existence of which depends on innumerable physical conditions peculiar to t
his planet; and this planet is determined by the mechanical balance of the whol
e universe of matter.  We may then say that our consciousness is causally conne
cted with the remotest galaxies; yet we do not know even how it arises from ---
 or with --- the molecular changes in the brain.)
  (11) Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by the
empirical application of certain {XV} principles whose interplay involves diffe
rent orders of idea connected with each other in a way beyond our present compr
ehension.
   (Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumb methods.  We do
not know what consciousness is, or how it is connected with muscular action; wh
at electricity is or how it is connected with the machines that generate it; an
d our methods depend on calculations involving mathematical ideas which have no
 correspondence in the Universe as we know it.>)
   (12) Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers.  Even his id
ea of his limitations is based on experience of the past, and every step in his
 progress extends his empire.  There is therefore no reason to assign theoretic
al limits> to what he may be, or to what he may do.
   (Illustration: A generation ago it was supposed theoretically impossible tha
t man should ever know the chemical composition of the fixed stars.  It is know
n that our senses are adapted to receive only an infinitesimal fraction of the
possible rates of vibration.  Modern instruments have enabled us to detect some
 of these suprasensibles by indirect methods, and even to use their peculiar qu
alities in the service of man, as in the case of the rays of Hertz and Rontgen.
  As Tyndall said, man might at any moment learn to perceive and utilise vibrat
ions of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds.  The question of Magick is a q
uestion of discovering and employing hitherto unknown forces in nature.  We kno
w that they exist, and we cannot doubt the possibility of mental or physical in
struments capable of bringing us into relation with them.)
   (13) Every man is more or less aware that his individuality  comprises sever
al orders of existence, even when he maintains that his subtler principles are
merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle.  A similar order may be
 assumed to extend throughout nature.
   (Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of toothache with {XVI} the dec
ay which causes it.  Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain physical forces
, such as electrical and thermal conductivity; but neither in us nor in them --
- so far as we know --- is there any direct conscious perception of these force
s.  Imperceptible influences are therefore associated with all material phenome
na; and there is no reason why we should not work upon matter through those sub
tle energies as we do through their material bases.  In fact, we use magnetic f
orce to move iron, and solar radiation to reproduce images.)
   (14) Man is capable of being, and using, anything which he perceives, for ev
erything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being.  He may t
hus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is conscious to his individual Wil
l.
   (Illustration: Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personal conduct,
 to obtain power over his fellow, to excuse his crimes, and for innumerable oth
er purposes, including that of realizing himself as God.  He has used the irrat
ional and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help him in the construction of
mechanical devices.  He has used his moral force to influence the actions even
of wild animals.  He has employed poetic genius for political purposes.)
   (15) Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into any ot
her kind of force by using suitable means.  There is thus an inexhaustible supp
ly of any particular kind of force that we may need.
   (Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and power by using it to d
rive dynamos.  The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by so ordering
 them in speech as to inflame war-like passions.  The hallucinations connected
with the mysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species.)
   (16) The application of any given force affects all the orders of being whic
h exist in the object to which it is applied, whichever of those orders is dire
ctly affected.
 (Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not his bod
y only, is affected by my act; although the dagger, as such, has no direct rela
tion therewith.  Similarly, the power of {XVII} my thought may so work on the m
ind of another person as to produce far-reaching physical changes in him, or in
 others through him.)
   (17) A man may learn to use any force so as to serve any purpose, by taking
advantage of the above theorems.
   (Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his speec
h, but using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedly utters a chosen word.  H
e may serve the same purpose by resolving that every incident of his life shall
 remind him of a particular thing, making every impression the starting point o
f a connected series of thoughts ending in that thing.  He might also devote hi
s whole energies to some one particular object, by resolving to do nothing at v
ariance therewith, and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.)
   (18) He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by making himself a
 fit receptacle for it, establishing a connection with it, and arranging condit
ions so that its nature compels it to flow toward him.
   (Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a place where
there is underground water; I prevent it from leaking away; and I arrange to ta
ke advantage of water's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.)
   (19) Man's sense of himself as separate from, and oppose to, the Universe is
 a bar to his conducting its currents.  It insulates him.
   (Illustration: A popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself,
and remembers only "The Cause".  Self-seeking engenders jealousies and schism.
 When the organs of the body assert their presence otherwise than by silent sat
isfaction, it is a sign that they are diseased.  The single exception is the or
gan of reproduction.  Yet even in this case its self-assertion bears witness to
 its dissatisfaction with itself, since it cannot fulfil its function until com
pleted by its counterpart in another organism.
   (20) Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he is really fitte
d.
 (Illustration:  You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  A {XVIII} tr
ue man of science learns from every phenomenon.  But Nature is dumb to the hypo
crite; for in her there is nothing false.>)
   (21) There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man with the Un
iverse in essence; for as soon as man makes himself one with any idea the means
 of measurement cease to exist.  But his power to utilize that force is limited
 by his mental power and capacity, and by the circumstances of his human enviro
nment.
   (Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes, to him, no
thing but love boundless and immanent; but his mystical state is not contagious
; his fellow-men are either amused or annoyed.  He can only extend to others th
e effect which his love has had upon himself by means of his mental and physica
l qualities.  Thus, Catullus, Dante and Swinburn made their love a mighty mover
 of mankind by virtue of their power to put their thoughts on the subject in mu
sical and eloquent language.  Again, Cleopatra and other people in authority mo
ulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence their pol
itical actions.  The Magician, however well he succeed in making contact with t
he secret sources of energy in nature, can only use them to the extent permitte
d by his intellectual and moral qualities.  Mohammed's intercourse with Gabriel
 was only effective because of his statesmanship, soldiership, and the sublimit
y of his command of Arabic.  Hertz's discovery of the rays which we now use for
 wireless telegraphy was sterile until reflected through the minds and wills of
 the people who could take his truth, and transmit it to the world of action by
 means of mechanical and economic instruments.)
   (22) every individual is essentially sufficient to himself.  But he is unsat
isfactory to himself until he has established himself in his right relation wit
h the Universe.
   (Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, is useless in the {XIX} hands
of savages.  A poet, however sublime, must impose himself upon his generation i
f he is to enjoy (and even to understand) himself, as theoretically should be t
he case.)
   (23) Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one's conditions.  I
t is the Art of applying that understanding in action.
   (Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a special ball in a special w
ay in special circumstances.  A Niblick should rarely be used on the tee, or a
Brassie under the bank of a bunker.  But also, the use of any club demands skil
l and experience.)
   (24) Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is.
   (Illustration: To insist that any one else shall comply with one's own stand
ards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, since both parties are equally b
orn of necessity.)
 (25) Every man must do Magick each time that he acts or even thinks, since a t
hought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action, thought it
 may not do so at the time.
   (Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man's own body and in
the air around him; it disturbs the balance of the entire Universe, and its eff
ects continue eternally throughout all space.  Every thought, however swiftly s
uppressed, has its effect on the mind.  It stands as one of the causes of every
 subsequent thought, and tends to influence every subsequent action.  A golfer
may lose a few yards on his drive, a few more with his second and third, he may
 lie on the green six bare inches too far from the hole; but the net result of
these trifling mishaps is the difference of a whole stroke, and so probably bet
ween halving and losing the hole.)
   (26) Every man has a right, the right of self-preservation, to fulfil himsel
f to the utmost.>
   (Illustration: A function imperfectly preformed injures, not {XX} only itsel
f, but everything associated with it.  If the heart is afraid to beat for fear
of disturbing the liver, the liver is starved for blood, and avenges itself on
the heart by upsetting digestion, which disorders respiration, on which cardiac
 welfare depends.)
   (27) Every man should make Magick the keynote of his life.  He should learn
its laws and live by them.
   (Illustration: The Banker should discover the real meaning of his existence,
 the real motive which led him to choose that profession.  He should understand
 banking as a necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind, instead of
 as merely a business whose objects are independent of the general welfare.  He
 should learn to distinguish false values from real, and to act not on accident
al fluctuations but on considerations of essential importance.  Such a banker w
ill prove himself superior to others; because he will not be an individual limi
ted by transitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and e
ternal as gravitation, as patient and irresistible as the tides.  His system wi
ll not be subject to panic, any more than the law of Inverse Squares is disturb
ed by Elections.  He will not be anxious about his affairs because they will no
t be his; and for that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, cle
ar-headed confidence of an onlooker, with intelligence unclouded by self-intere
st and power unimpaired by passion.)
   (28) Every man has a right to fulfil his own will without being afraid that
it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in his proper place, it is t
he fault of others if they interfere with him.
 (Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to co
ntrol Europe, he should not be blamed for exercising his rights.  To oppose him
 would be an error.  Any one so doing would have made a mistake as to his own d
estiny, except in so far as it might be necessary for him to learn to lessons o
f defeat.  The sun moves in space without interference.  The order of Nature pr
ovides an orbit for each star.  A clash proves that one or the other has straye
d from his course.  But as to each man that keeps his true course, the more fir
mly he acts, the less likely are others to get in his way.  His example will he
lp {XXI} them to find their own paths and pursue them.  Every man that becomes
a Magician helps others to do likewise.  The more firmly and surely men move, a
nd the more such action is accepted as the standard of morality, the less will
conflict and confusion hamper humanity.)

                           --------------

 I hope that the above principles will demonstrate to
                               ALL
that their welfare, their very existence, is bound up in
                                MAGICK.
I trust that they will understand, not only the reasonableness, but the necessi
ty of the fundamental truth which I was the means of giving to mankind:
   "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
I trust that they will assert themselves as individually absolute, that they wi
ll grasp the fact that it is their right to assert themselves, and to accomplis
h the task for which their nature fits them.  Yea, more, that this is their dut
y, and that not only to themselves but to others, a duty founded upon universal
 necessity, and not to be shirked on account of any casual circumstances of the
 moment which may seem to put such conduct in the light of inconvenience or eve
n of cruelty.
   I hope that the principles outlined above will help them to understand this
book, and prevent them from being deterred from its study by the more or less t
echnical language in which it is written.
   The essence of
                          MAGICK
is simple enough in all conscience.  It is not otherwise with the art of govern
ment.  The Aim is simply prosperity; but the theory is tangled, and the practic
e beset with briars.
   In the same way
                          MAGICK
is merely to be and to do.  I should add: "to suffer".  For Magick is the verb;
 and it is part of the Training to use the passive voice.  This is, however, a
matter of Initiation rather than of Magick in {XXII} its ordinary sense.  It is
 not my fault if being is baffling, and doing desperate!
   Yet, once the above principles are firmly fixed in the mind, it is easy enou
gh to sum up the situation very shortly.  One must find out for oneself, and ma
ke sure beyond doubt, "who" one is, "what" one is, "why" one is.  This done, on
e may put the will which is implicit in the "Why" into words, or rather into On
e Word.  Being thus conscious of the proper course to pursue, the next thing is
 to understand the conditions necessary to following it out.  After that, one m
ust eliminate from oneself every element alien or hostile to success, and devel
op those parts of oneself which are specially needed to control the aforesaid c
onditions.
   Let us make an analogy.  A nation must become aware of its own character bef
ore it can be said to exist.  From that knowledge it must divine its destiny.
It must then consider the political conditions of the world; how other countrie
s may help it or hinder it.  It must then destroy it itself any elements discor
dant with its destiny.  Lastly, it must develop in itself those qualities which
 will enable it to combat successfully the external conditions which threaten t
o oppose is purpose.  We have had a recent example in the case of the young Ger
man Empire, which, knowing itself and its will, disciplined and trained itself
so that it conquered the neighbours which had oppressed it for so many centurie
s.  But after 1866 and 1870, 1914!  It mistook itself for superhuman, it willed
 a thing impossible, it failed to eliminate its own internal jealousies, it fai
led to understand the conditions of victory,> it did not train itself to hold t
he sea, and thus, having violated every principle of
                           MAGICK,
it was pulled down and broken into pieces by provincialism and democracy, so th
at neither individual excellence nor civic virtue has yet availed to raise it a
gain to that majestic unity which made so bold a bid for the mastery of the rac
e of man.
   The sincere student will discover, behind the symbolic technicalities of his
 book, a practical method of making himself a {XXIII} Magician.  The processes
described will enable him to discriminate between what he actually is, and what
 he has fondly imagined himself to be>.  He must behold his soul in all its awf
ul nakedness, he must not fear to look on that appalling actuality.  He must di
scard the gaudy garments with which his shame has screened him; he must accept
the fact that nothing can make him anything but what he is.  He may lie to hims
elf, drug himself, hide himself; but he is always there.  Magick will teach him
 that his mind is playing him traitor.  It is as if a man were told that tailor
s' fashion-plates were the canon of human beauty, so that he tried to make hims
elf formless and featureless like them, and shuddered with horror at the idea o
f Holbein making a portrait of him.  Magick will show him the beauty and majest
y of the self which he has tried to suppress and disguise.
   Having discovered his identity, he will soon perceive his purpose.  Another
process will show him how to make that purpose pure and powerful.  He may then
learn how to estimate his environment, learn how to make allies, how to make hi
mself prevail against all powers whose error has caused them to wander across h
is path.
   In the course of this Training, he will learn to explore the Hidden Mysterie
s of Nature, and to develop new senses and faculties in himself, whereby he may
 communicate with, and control, Beings and Forces pertaining to orders of exist
ence which {XXIV} have been hitherto inaccessible to profane research, and avai
lable only to that unscientific and empirical
                           MAGICK
(of tradition) which I came to destroy in order that I might fulfil.
   I send this book into the world that every man and woman may take hold of li
fe in the proper manner.  It does not matter of one's present house of flesh be
 the hut of a shepherd; by virtue of my
                           MAGICK
he shall be such a shepherd as David was.  If it be the studio of a sculptor, h
e shall so chisel from himself the marble that masks his idea that he shall be
no less a master than Rodin.

                             CHAPTER 0

                THE MAGICAL THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE

   There are three main theories of the Universe; Dualism, Monism and Nihilism.
  It is impossible to enter into a discussion of their relative merits in a pop
ular manual of this sort.  They may be studied in Erdmann's "History of Philoso
phy" and similar treatises.
   All are reconciled and unified in the theory which we shall now set forth.
The basis of this Harmony is given in Crowley's
"Berashith" --- to which reference should be made.
   Infinite space is called the goddess NUIT, while the infinitely small and at
omic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT.>  These are unmanifest.  One conjun
ction of these infinites is called RA-HOOR-KHUIT,> a unity which includes and h
eads all things.>  (There is also a particular Nature of Him, in certain condit
ions, such as have obtained since the Spring of 1904, e.v.)  This profoundly my
stical conception {1} is based upon actual spiritual experience, but the traine
d reason> can reach a reflection of this idea by the method of logical contradi
ction which ends in reason transcending itself.  The reader should consult "The
 Soldier and the Hunchback" in Equinox I, I, and Konx Om Pax.
   "Unity" transcends "consciousness".  It is above all division.  The Father o
f thought --- the Word --- is called Chaos --- the dyad.  The number Three, the
 Mother, is called Babalon.  In connection with this the reader should study "T
he Temple of Solomon the King" in Equinox I, V, and Liber 418.
   This first triad is essentially unity, in a manner transcending reason.  The
 comprehension of this Trinity is a matter of spiritual experience.  All true g
ods are attributed to this Trinity.>
   An immeasurable abyss divides it from all manifestations of Reason or the lo
wer qualities of man.  In the ultimate analysis of Reason, we find all reason i
dentified with this abyss.  Yet this abyss is the crown of the mind.  Purely in
tellectual faculties all obtain here.  This abyss has no number, for in it all
is confusion.
   Below this abyss we find the moral qualities of Man, of which there are six.
  The highest is symbolised by the number Four.  Its nature is fatherly>; Mercy
 and Authority are the attributes of its dignity.
   The number Five is balanced against it.  The attributes of Five are Energy a
nd Justice.  Four and Five are again combined and harmonized in the number Six,
 whose nature is beauty and harmony, mortality and immortality.
   In the number Seven the feminine nature is again predominant, {2} but it is
the masculine type of female, the Amazon, who is balanced in the number Eight b
y the feminine type of male.
   In the number Nine we reach the last of the purely mental qualities.  It ide
ntifies change with stability.
   Pendant to this sixfold system is the number Ten>
 which includes the whole of Matter as we know it by the senses.
   It is impossible here to explain thoroughly the complete conception; for it
cannot be too clearly understood that this is a "classification" of the Univers
e, that there is nothing which is not comprehended therein.
   The Article on the Qabalah in Vol. I, No. V of the Equinox is the best which
 has been written on the subject.  It should be deeply studied, in connection w
ith the Qabalistic Diagrams in Nos. II and III: "The Temple of Solomon the King
".
   Such is a crude and elementary sketch of this system.
   The formula of Tetragrammaton is the most important for the practical magici
an.  Here Yod = 2, He = 3, Vau = 4 to 9, He final = 10.
 The Number Two represents Yod, the Divine or Archetypal World, and the Number
One is only attained by the destruction of the God and the Magician in Samadhi.
  The world of Angels is under the numbers Four to Nine, and that of spirits un
der the {3} number Ten.>  All these numbers are of course parts of the magician
 himself considered as the microcosm.  The microcosm is an exact image of the M
acrocosm; the Great Work is the raising of the whole man in perfect balance to
the power of Infinity.
   The reader will remark that all criticism directed against the Magical Hiera
rchy is futile.  One cannot call it incorrect --- the only line to take might b
e that it was inconvenient.  In the same way one cannot say that the Roman alph
abet is better or worse than the Greek, since all required sounds can be more o
r less satisfactorily represented by either; yet both these alphabets were foun
d so little satisfactory when it came to an attempt at phonetic printing of Ori
ental languages, that the alphabet had to be expanded by the use of italics and
 other diacritical marks.  In the same way our magical alphabet of the Sephirot
h and the Paths (thirty-two letters as it were) has been expanded into the four
 worlds corresponding to the four letters of the name Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh; and each
 Sephira is supposed to contain a Tree of Life of its own.  Thus we obtain four
 hundred Sephiroth instead of the original ten, and the Paths being capable of
similar multiplications, or rather of subdivision, the number is still further
extended.  Of course this process might be indefinitely continued without destr
oying the original system.
 The Apologia for this System is that our purest conceptions {4}  are symbolize
d in Mathematics.  "God is the Great Arithmetician."  "God is the Grand Geomete
r."  It is best therefore to prepare to apprehend Him by formulating our minds
according to these measures.>
   To return, each letter of this alphabet may have its special magical sigil.
 The student must not expect to be given a cut-and-dried definition of what exa
ctly is meant by any of all this.  On the contrary, he must work backwards, put
ting the whole of his mental and moral outfit into these pigeon-holes.  You wou
ld not expect to be able to buy a filing cabinet with the names of all your pas
t, present and future correspondents ready indexed: your cabinet has a system o
f letters and numbers meaningless in themselves, but ready to take on a meaning
 to you, as you fill up the files.  As your business increased, each letter and
 number would receive fresh accessions of meaning for you; and by adopting this
 orderly arrangement you would be able to have a much more comprehensive grasp
of your affairs than would otherwise be the case.  By the use of this system th
e magician is able ultimately to unify the whole of his knowledge --- to transm
ute, even on the Intellectual Plane, the Many into the One.
   The Reader can now understand that the sketch given above of the magical Hie
rarchy is hardly even an outline of the real theory of the Universe.  This theo
ry may indeed be studied in the article already referred to in No. V of the Equ
inox, and, more deeply in the Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon: but
 the true understanding depends entirely upon the work of the Magician himself.
  Without magical experience it will be meaningless.
   In this there is nothing peculiar.  It is so with all scientific knowledge.
 A blind man might cram up astronomy for the purpose of passing examinations, b
ut his knowledge would be {5} almost entirely unrelated to his experience, and
it would certainly not give him sight.  A similar phenomenon is observed when a
 gentleman who has taken an "honours degree" in modern languages at Cambridge a
rrives in Paris, and is unable to order his dinner.  To exclaim against the Mas
ter Therion is to act like a person who, observing this, should attack both the
 professors of French and the inhabitants of Paris, and perhaps go on to deny t
he existence of France.
   Let us say, once again, that the magical language is nothing but a convenien
t system of classification to enable the magician to docket his experiences as
he obtains them.
   Yet this is true also, that, once the language is mastered, one can divine t
he unknown by study of the known, just as one's knowledge of Latin and Greek en
ables one to understand some unfamiliar English word derived from those sources
.  Also, there is the similar case of the Periodic Law in Chemistry, which enab
les Science to prophesy, and so in the end to discover, the existence of certai
n previously unsuspected elements in nature.  All discussions upon philosophy a
re necessarily sterile, since truth is beyond language.  They are, however, use
ful if carried far enough --- if carried to the point when it become apparent t
hat all arguments are arguments in a circle.>  But discussions of the details o
f purely imaginary qualities are frivolous and may be deadly.  For the great da
nger of this magical theory is that the student may mistake the alphabet for th
e things which the words represent.
   An excellent man of great intelligence, a learned Qabalist, once amazed the
Master Therion by stating that the Tree of Life was the framework of the Univer
se.  It was as if some one had seriously maintained that a cat was a creature c
onstructed by placing the letters C. A. T. in that order.  It is no wonder that
 Magick has excited the ridicule of the unintelligent, since even its {6} educa
ted students can be guilty of so gross a violation of the first principles of c
ommon sense.>
   A synopsis of the grades of the A.'. A.'. as illustrative of the Magical Hie
rarchy in Man is given in Appendix 2 "One Star in Sight."  This should be read
before proceeding with the chapter.  The subject is very difficult.  To deal wi
th it in full is entirely beyond the limits of this small treatise.

            "FURTHER CONCERNING THE MAGICAL UNIVERSE"
   All these letters of the magical alphabet --- referred to above --- are like
 so many names on a map.  Man himself is a complete microcosm.  Few other being
s have this balanced perfection.  Of course every sun, every planet, may have b
eings similarly constituted.>  But when we speak of dealing with the planets in
 Magick, {7} the reference is usually not to the actual planets, but to parts o
f the earth which are of the nature attributed to these planets.  Thus, when we
 say that Nakhiel is the "Intelligence" of the Sun, we do not mean that he live
s in the Sun, but only that he has a certain rank and character; and although w
e can invoke him, we do not necessarily mean that he exists in the same sense o
f the word in which our butcher exists.
 When we "conjure Nakhiel to visible appearance," it may be that our process re
sembles creation --- or, rather imagination --- more nearly than it does callin
g-forth.  The aura of a man is called the "magical mirror of the universe"; and
, so far as any one can tell, nothing exists outside of this mirror.  It is at
least convenient to represent the whole as if it were subjective.  It leads to
less confusion.  And, as a man is a perfect microcosm,> it is perfectly easy to
 re-model one's conception at any moment.
   Now there is a traditional correspondence, which modern experiment has shown
 to be fairly reliable.  There is a certain natural connexion between certain l
etters, words, numbers, gestures, shapes, perfumes and so on, so that any idea
or (as we might call it) "spirit", may be composed or called forth by the use o
f those things which are harmonious with it, and express particular parts of it
s nature.  These correspondences have been elaborately mapped in the Book 777 i
n a very convenient and compendious form.  It will be necessary for the student
 to make a careful study of this book in connexion with some actual rituals of
Magick, for example, {8} that of the evocation of Taphtatharath printed in Equi
nox I, III, pages 170-190, where he will see exactly why these things are to be
 used.  Of course, as the student advances in knowledge by experience he will f
ind a progressive subtlety in the magical universe corresponding to his own; fo
r let it be said yet again! not only is his aura a magical mirror of the univer
se, but the universe is a magical mirror of his aura.
   In this chapter we are only able to give a very thin outline of magical theo
ry --- faint pencilling by weak and wavering fingers --- for this subject may a
lmost be said to be co-extensive with one's whole knowledge.
   The knowledge of exoteric science is comically limited by the fact that we h
ave no access, except in the most indirect way, to any other celestial body tha
n our own.  In the last few years, the semi-educated have got an idea that they
 know a great deal about the universe, and the principal ground for their fine
opinion of themselves is usually the telephone or the airship.  It is pitiful t
o read the bombastic twaddle about progress, which journalists and others, who
wish to prevent men from thinking, put out for consumption.  We know infinitesi
mally little of the material universe.  Our detailed knowledge is so contemptib
ly minute, that it is hardly worth reference, save that our shame may spur us t
o increased endeavour.  Such knowledge> as we have got is of a very general and
 abstruse, of a philosophical and almost magical character.  This consists prin
cipally of the conceptions of pure mathematics.  It is, therefore, almost legit
imate to say that pure mathematics is our link with the rest of the universe an
d with "God".
   Now the conceptions of Magick are themselves profoundly mathematical.  The w
hole basis of our theory is the Qabalah, which corresponds to mathematics and g
eometry.  The method of operation in Magick is based on this, in very much the
same way as the laws of mechanics are based on mathematics.  So far, therefore
as we can be said to possess a magical theory of the universe, it must be a mat
ter solely of fundamental law, with a {9} few simple and comprehensive proposit
ions stated in very general terms.
   I might expend a life-time in exploring the details of one plane, just as an
 explorer might give his life to one corner of Africa, or a chemist to one subg
roup of compounds.  Each such detailed piece of work may be very valuable, but
it does not as a rule throw light on the main principles of the universe.  Its
truth is the truth of one angle.  It might even lead to error, if some inferior
 person were to generalize from too few facts.
   Imagine an inhabitant of Mars who wished to philosophise about the earth, an
d had nothing to go by but the diary of some man at the North Pole!  But the wo
rk of every explorer, on whatever branch of the Tree of Life the caterpillar he
 is after may happen to be crawling, is immensely helped by a grasp of general
principles.  Every magician, therefore, should study the Holy Qabalah.  Once he
 has mastered the main principles, he will find his work grow easy.

                              CHAPTER I

                      THE PRINCIPLES OF RITUAL.

 There is a single main definition of the object of all magical Ritual.  It is
the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm.  The Supreme and Complete Ritu
al is therefore the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel;> or, in the language
 of Mysticism, Union with God.>
   All other magical Rituals are particular cases of this general principle, an
d the only excuse for doing them is that it sometimes occurs that one particula
r portion of the microcosm is so weak that its imperfection of impurity would v
itiate the Macrocosm of which it is the image, Eidolon, or Reflexion.  For exam
ple, God is above sex; and therefore neither man nor woman as such can be said
fully to understand, much less to represent, God.  It is therefore incumbent on
 the male magician to cultivate those female virtues in which he is deficient,
and this task he must of course accomplish without in any way impairing his vir
ility.  It will then be lawful for a magician to invoke Isis, and identify hims
elf with her; if he fail to do this, his apprehension of the Universe when he a
ttains Samadhi will lack the conception of maternity.  The result will be a met
aphysical and --- by corollary --- ethical limitation in the Religion which he
founds.  Judaism and Islam are striking example of this failure.
   To take another example, the ascetic life which devotion to {11} magick so o
ften involves argues a poverty of nature, a narrowness, a lack of generosity.
Nature is infinitely prodigal --- not one in a million seeds ever comes to frui
tion.  Whoso fails to recognise this, let him invoke Jupiter.>
   The danger of ceremonial magick --- the sublest and deepest danger --- is th
is: that the magician will naturally tend to invoke that partial being which mo
st strongly appeals to him, so that his natural excess in that direction will b
e still further exaggerated.  Let him, before beginning his Work, endeavour to
map out his own being, and arrange his invocations in such a way as to redress
the balance.>  This, of course, should have been done in a preliminary fashion
during the preparation of the weapons and furniture of the Temple.
   To consider in a more particular manner this question of the Nature of Ritua
l, we may suppose that he finds himself lacking in that perception of the value
 of Life and Death, alike of individuals and of races, which is characteristic
of Nature.  He has perhaps a tendency to perceive the "first noble truth" utter
ed by Buddha, that Everything is sorrow.  Nature, it seems, is a tragedy.  He h
as perhaps even experienced the great trance called Sorrow.  He should then con
sider whether there is not some Deity who expresses this Cycle, and yet whose n
ature is joy.  He will find what he requires in Dionysus.
   There are three main methods of invoking any Deity.
   The "First Method" consists of devotion to that Deity, and, being mainly mys
tical in character, need not be dealt with in this place, especially as a perfe
ct instruction exists in Liber 175 ("See" Appendix).
   The "Second method"is the straight forward ceremonial invocation.  It is the
 method which was usually employed in the Middle Ages.  Its advantage is its di
rectness, its disadvantage its {12} crudity.  The "Goetia" gives clear instruct
ion in this method, and so do many other rituals, white and black.  We shall pr
esently devote some space to a clear exposition of this Art.
   In the case of Bacchus, however, we may roughly outline the procedure.  We f
ind that the symbolism of Tiphareth expresses the nature of Bacchus.  It is the
n necessary to construct a Ritual of Tiphareth.  Let us open the Book 777; we s
hall find in line 6 of each column the various parts of our required apparatus.
  Having ordered everything duly, we shall exalt the mind by repeated prayers o
r conjurations to the highest conception of the God, until, in one sense or ano
ther of the word, He appears to us and floods our consciousness with the light
of His divinity.
   The "Third Method is the Dramatic," perhaps the most attractive of all; cert
ainly it is so to the artist's temperament, for it appeals to his imagination t
hrough his aesthetic sense.
   Its disadvantage lies principally in the difficulty of its performance by a
single person.  But it has the sanction of the highest antiquity, and is probab
ly the most useful for the foundation of a religion.  It is the method of Catho
lic Christianity, and consists in the dramatization of the legend of the God.
The Bacchae of Euripides is a magnificent example of such a Ritual; so also, th
rough in a less degree, is the Mass.  We may also mention many of the degrees i
n Freemasonry, particularly the third.  The 5 Degree = 6Square Ritual published
 in No. III of the Equinox is another example.
   In the case of Bacchus, one commemorates firstly his birth of a mortal mothe
r who has yielded her treasure-house to the Father of All, of the jealousy and
rage excited by this incarnation, and of the heavenly protection afforded to th
e infant.  Next should be commemorated the journeying westward upon an ass.  No
w comes the great scene of the drama: the gentle, exquisite youth with his foll
owing (chiefly composed of women) seems to threaten the established order of th
ings, and that Established Order takes steps to put an end to the upstart.  We
find Dionysus confronting the angry King, not with defiance, but with meekness;
 yet with a subtle confidence, an underlying laughter.  His forehead is wreathe
d with vine tendrils.  He is an effeminate figure with those broad leaves clust
ered upon his brow?  But those leaves hide {13} horns.  King Pentheus, represen
tative of respectability,> is destroyed by his pride.  He goes out into the mou
ntains to attack the women who have followed Bacchus, the youth whom he has moc
ked, scourged, and put in chains, yet who has only smiled; and by those women,
in their divine madness, he is torn to pieces.
   It has already seemed impertinent to say so much when Walter Pater has told
the story with such sympathy and insight.  We will not further transgress by dw
elling upon the identity of this legend with the course of Nature, its madness,
 its prodigality, its intoxication, its joy, and above all its sublime persiste
nce through the cycles of Life and Death.  The pagan reader must labour to unde
rstand this in Pater's "Greek Studies", and the Christian reader will recognise
 it, incident for incident, in the story of Christ.  This legend is but the dra
matization of Spring.
   The magician who wishes to invoke Bacchus by this method must therefore arra
nge a ceremony in which he takes the part of Bacchus, undergoes all His trials,
 and emerges triumphant from beyond death.  He must, however, be warned against
 mistaking the symbolism.  In this case, for example, the doctrine of individua
l immortality has been dragged in, to the destruction of truth.  It is not that
 utterly worthless part of man, his individual consciousness as John Smith, whi
ch defies death --- that consciousness which dies and is reborn in every though
t.  That which persists (if anything persist) is his real John Smithiness, a qu
ality of which he was probably never conscious in his life.>
   Even that does not persist unchanged.  It is always growing.  The Cross is a
 barren stick, and the petals of the Rose fall and decay; but in the union of t
he Cross and the Rose is a constant {14} succession of new lives.>  Without thi
s union, and without this death of the individual, the cycle would be broken.
   A chapter will be consecrated to removing the practical difficulties of this
 method of Invocation.  It will doubtless have been noted by the acumen of the
reader that in the great essentials these three methods are one.  In each case
the magician identifies himself with the Deity invoked.  To "invoke" is to "cal
l in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth".  This is the essential difference
 between the two branches of Magick.  In invocation, the macrocosm floods the c
onsciousness.  In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates
 a microcosm.  You "in"voke a God into the Circle.  You "e"voke a Spirit into t
he Triangle.  In the first method identity with the God is attained by love and
 by surrender, by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant (and illusionary) par
ts of yourself.  It is the weeding of a garden.
   In the second method identity is attained by paying special attention to the
 desired part of yourself: positive, as the first method is negative.  It is th
e potting-out and watering of a particular flower in the garden, and the exposu
re of it to the sun.
   In the third, identity is attained by sympathy.  It is very difficult for th
e ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a nove
l; but for those who can do so, this method is unquestionably the best.
   Observe: each element in this cycle is of equal value.  It is wrong to say t
riumphantly "Mors janua vitae", unless you add, with equal triumph, "Vita janua
 mortis".  To one who understands this chain of the Aeons from the point of vie
w alike of the sorrowing Isis and of the triumphant Osiris, not forgetting thei
r link in the destroyer Apophis, there remains no secret veiled in Nature.  He
cries that name of God which throughout History has been echoed by one religion
 to another, the infinite swelling paean I.A.O.!>  {15}






                            CHAPTER II

               THE FORMULAE OF THE ELEMENTAL WEAPONS.

   Before discussing magical formulae in detail, one may observe that most ritu
als are composite, and contain many formulae which must be harmonized into one.
   The first formula is that of the Wand.  In the sphere of the principle which
 the magician wishes to invoke, he rises from point to point in a perpendicular
 line, and then descends; or else, beginning at the top, he comes directly down
, "invoking" first the god of that sphere by "devout supplication"> that He may
 deign to send the appropriate Archangel.  He then "beseeches" the Archangel to
 send the Angel or Angels of that sphere to his aid; he "conjures" this Angel o
r Angels to send the intelligence in question, and this intelligence he will "c
onjure with authority" to compel the obedience of the spirit and his manifestat
ion.  To this spirit he "issues commands".
   It will be seen that this is a formula rather of evocation than of invocatio
n, and for the latter the procedure, though apparently the same, should be conc
eived of in a different manner, which brings it under another formula, that of
Tetragrammaton.  The essence of the force invoked is one, but the "God" represe
nts the germ or beginning of the force, the "Archangel" its development; and so
 on, until, with the "Spirit", we have the completion and perfection of that fo
rce.  {16}
   The formula of the Cup is not so well suited for Evocations, and the magical
 Hierarchy is not involved in the same way; for the Cup being passive rather th
an active, it is not fitting for the magician to use it in respect of anything
but the Highest.  In practical working it consequently means little but prayer,
 and that prayer the "prayer of silence".>
 The formula of the dagger is again unsuitable for either purpose, since the na
ture of the dagger is to criticise, to destroy, to disperse; and all true magic
al ceremonies tend to concentration.  The dagger will therefore appear principa
lly in the banishings, preliminary to the ceremony proper.
   The formula of the pantacle is again of no particular use; for the pantacle
is inert.  In fine, the formula of the wand is the only one with which we need
more particularly concern ourselves.>
   Now in order to invoke any being, it is said by Hermes Trismegistus that the
 magi employ three methods.  The first, for the vulgar, is that of supplication
.  In this the crude objective theory is assumed as true.  There is a god named
 A, whom you, B, proceed to petition, in exactly the same sense as a boy might
ask his father for pocket-money.
   The second method involves a little more subtlety, inasmuch as the magician
endeavours to harmonize himself with the nature of the god, and to a certain ex
tent exalts himself, in the course of the ceremony; but the third method is the
 only one worthy of our consideration.
   This consists of a real identification of the magician and the god.  Note th
at to do this in perfection involves the attainment of a species of Samadhi: an
d this fact alone suffices to link irrefragably magick with mysticism.
   Let us describe the magical method of identification.  The symbolic form of
the god is first studied with as much care as an artist would bestow upon his m
odel, so that a perfectly clear and {17} unshakeable mental picture of the god
is presented to the mind.  Similarly, the attributes of the god are enshrined i
n speech, and such speeches are committed perfectly to memory.  The invocation
will then begin with a prayer to the god, commemorating his physical attributes
, always with profound understanding of their real meaning.  In the "second par
t" of the invocation, the voice of the god is heard, and His characteristic utt
erance is recited.
   In the "third portion" of the invocation the magician asserts the identity o
f himself with the god.  In the "fourth portion" the god is again invoked, but
as if by Himself, as if it were the utterance of the will of the god that He sh
ould manifest in the magician.  At the conclusion of this, the original object
of the invocation is stated.
   Thus, in the invocation of Thoth which is to be found in the rite of Mercury
 (Equinox I, VI) and in Liber LXIV, the first part begins with the words "Majes
ty of Godhead, wisdom-crowned TAHUTI, Thee, Thee I invoke.  Oh Thou of the Ibis
 head, Thee, Thee I invoke"; and so on.  At the conclusion of this a mental ima
ge of the God, infinitely vast and infinitely splendid, should be perceived, in
 just the same sense as a man might see the Sun.
   The second part begins with the words:
   "Behold!  I am yesterday, today, and the brother of tomorrow."
   The magician should imagine that he is hearing this voice, and at the same t
ime that he is echoing it, that it is true also of himself.  This thought shoul
d so exalt him that he is able at its conclusion to utter the sublime words whi
ch open the third part: "Behold! he is in me, and I am in him."  At this moment
, he loses consciousness of his mortal being; he is that mental image which he
previously but saw.  This consciousness is only complete as he goes on: "Mine i
s the radiance wherein Ptah floateth over his firmament.  I travel upon high.
I tread upon the firmament of Nu.  I raise a flashing flame with the lightnings
 of mine eye: ever rushing on in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra --- gi
ving my life to the treaders of Earth!"  This thought gives the relation of God
 and Man from the divine point of view.
 The magician is only recalled to himself at the conclusion of the {18} third p
art; in which occur, almost as if by accident, the words: "Therefore do all thi
ngs obey my word."  Yet in the fourth part, which begins: "Therefore do thou co
me forth unto me", it is not really the magician who is addressing the God; it
is the God who hears the far-off utterance of the magician.  If this invocation
 has been correctly performed, the words of the fourth part will sound distant
and strange.  It is surprising that a dummy (so the magus now appears to Himsel
f) should be able to speak!
   The Egyptian Gods are so complete in their nature, so perfectly spiritual an
d yet so perfectly material, that this one invocation is sufficient.  The God b
ethinks him that the spirit of Mercury should now appear to the magician; and i
t is so.  This Egyptian formula is therefore to be preferred to the Hierarchica
l formula of the Hebrews with its tedious prayers, conjurations, and curses.
   It will be noted, however, that in this invocation of Thoth which we have su
mmarized, there is another formula contained, the Reverberating or Reciprocatin
g formula, which may be called the formula of Horus and Harpocrates.  The magic
ian addresses the God with an active projection of his will, and then becomes p
assive while the God addresses the Universe.  In the fourth part he remains sil
ent, listening, to the prayer which arises therefrom.
   The formula of this invocation of Thoth may also be classed under Tetragramm
aton.  The first part is fire, the eager prayer of the magician, the second wat
er, in which the magician listens to, or catches the reflection of, the god.  T
he third part is air, the marriage of fire and water; the god and the man have
become one; while the fourth part corresponds to earth, the condensation or mat
erialization of those three higher principles.
   With regard to the Hebrew formulae, it is doubtful whether most magicians wh
o use them have ever properly grasped the principles underlying the method of i
dentity.  No passage which implies it occurs to mind, and the extant rituals ce
rtainly give no hint of such a conception, or of any but the most personal and
material views of the nature of things.  They seem to have thought that there w
as an Archangel named Ratziel in exactly the same sense as there was a statesma
n named Richelieu, an individual being living in a definite place.  He had poss
ibly certain powers of a somewhat metaphysical order --- he might be {19} in tw
o places at once,> for example, though even the possibility of so simple a feat
 (in the case of spirits) seems to be denied by certain passages in extant conj
urations which tell the spirit that if he happens to be in chains in a particul
ar place in Hell, or if some other magician is conjuring him so that he cannot
come, then let him send a spirit of similar nature, or otherwise avoid the diff
icultly.  But of course so vulgar a conception would not occur to the student o
f the Qabalah.  It is  just possible that the magi wrote their conjurations on
this crude hypothesis in order to avoid the clouding of the mind by doubt and m
etaphysical speculation.
   He who became the Master Therion was once confronted by this very difficulty
.  Being determined to instruct mankind, He sought a simple statement of his ob
ject.  His will was sufficiently informed by common sense to decide him to teac
h man "The Next Step", the thing which was immediately above him.  He might hav
e called this "God", or "The Higher Self", or "The Augoeides", or "Adi-Buddha",
 or 61 other things --- but He had discovered that these were all one, yet that
 each one represented some theory of the Universe which would ultimately be sha
ttered by criticism --- for He had already passed through the realm of Reason,
and knew that every statement contained an absurdity.  He therefore said: "Let
me declare this Work under this title: 'The obtaining of the Knowledge and Conv
ersation of the Holy Guardian Angel'", because the theory implied in these word
s is so patently absurd that only simpletons would waste much time in analysing
 it.  It would be accepted as a convention, and no one would incur the grave da
nger of building a philosophical system upon it.
 With this understanding, we may rehabilitate the Hebrew system of invocations.
  The mind is the great enemy; so, by invoking enthusiastically a person whom w
e know not to exist, we are rebuking that mind.  Yet we should not refrain alto
gether from philosophising in the light of the Holy Qabalah.  We should accept
the Magical Hierarchy as a more or less convenient classification of the facts
of the Universe as they are {20} known to us; and as our knowledge and understa
nding of those facts increase, so should we endeavour to adjust our idea of wha
t we mean by any symbol.
   At the same time let us reflect that there is a certain definite consensus o
f experience as to the correlation of the various beings of the hierarchy with
the observed facts of Magick.  In the simple matter of astral vision, for examp
le, one striking case may be quoted.
   Without telling him what it was, the Master Therion once recited as an invoc
ation Sappho's "Ode to Venus" before a Probationer of the A.'. A.'. who was ign
orant of Greek, the language of the Ode.  The disciple then went on an "astral
journey," and everything seen by him was without exception harmonious with Venu
s.  This was true down to the smallest detail.  He even obtained all the four c
olour-scales of Venus with absolute correctness.  Considering that he saw somet
hing like one hundred symbols in all, the odds against coincidence are incalcul
ably great.  Such an experience (and the records of the A.'. A.'. contain dozen
s of similar cases) affords proof as absolute as any proof can be in this world
 of Illusion that the correspondences in Liber 777 really represent facts in Na
ture.
   It suggests itself that this "straightforward" system of magick was perhaps
never really employed at all.  One might maintain that the invocations which ha
ve come down to us are but the ruins of the Temple of Magick.  The exorcisms mi
ght have been committed to writing for the purpose of memorising them, while it
 was forbidden to make any record of the really important parts of the ceremony
.  Such details of Ritual as we possess are meagre and unconvincing, and though
 much success has been attained in the quite conventional exoteric way both by
FRATER PERDURABO and by many of his colleagues, yet ceremonies of this characte
r have always remained tedious and difficult.  It has seemed as if the success
were obtained almost in spite of the ceremony.  In any case, they are the more
mysterious parts of the Ritual which have evoked the divine force.  Such conjur
ations as those of the "Goetia" leave one cold, although, notably in the second
 conjuration, there is a crude attempt to use that formula of Commemoration of
which we spoke in the preceding Chapter.  {21}







                             CHAPTER III

                  THE FORMULA OF TETRAGRAMMATON.>

   This formula is of most universal aspect, as all things are necessarily comp
rehended in it; but its use in a magical ceremony is little understood.
   The climax of the formula is in one sense before even the formulation of the
 Yod.  For the Yod is the most divine aspect of the Force --- the remaining let
ters are but a solidification of the same thing.  It must be understood that we
 are here speaking of the whole ceremony considered as a unity, not merely of t
hat formula in which "Yod" is the god invoked, "He" the Archangel, and so on.
In order to understand the ceremony under this formula, we must take a more ext
ended view of the functions of the four weapons than we have hitherto done.
   The formation of the "Yod" is the formulation of the first creative force, o
f that father who is called "self-begotten", and unto whom it is said: "Thou ha
s formulated thy Father, and made fertile thy Mother".  The adding of the "He"
to the "Yod" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who i
s a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit.  Their union brings forth the son "Va
u" who is the heir.  Finally the daughter "He" is produced.  She is both the tw
in sister and the daughter of "Vau".>
   His mission is to redeem her by making her his bride; the result of this is
to set her upon the throne of her mother, and it is only she whose youthful emb
race can reawaken the eld of the {22} All-Father.  In this complex family relat
ionship> is symbolised the whole course of the Universe.  It will be seen that
(after all) the Climax is at the end.  It is the second half of the formula whi
ch symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish.  The first ste
p of this is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guard
ian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order.
   The re-entry of these twin spouses into the womb of the mother is that initi
ation described in Liber 418, which gives admission to the Inmost Order of the
A.'. A.'.  Of the last step we cannot speak.
   It will now be recognised that to devise a practical magical ceremony to cor
respond to Tetragrammaton in this exalted sense might be difficult if not impos
sible.  In such a ceremony the Rituals of purification alone might occupy many
incarnations.
   It will be necessary, therefore, to revert to the simpler view of Tetragramm
aton, remembering only that the "He" final is the Throne of the Spirit, of the
Shin of Pentagrammaton.
   The Yod will represent a swift and violent creative energy; following this w
ill be a calmer and more reflective but even more powerful flow of will, the ir
resistible force of a mighty river.  This state of mind will be followed by an
expansion of the consciousness; it will penetrate all space, and this will fina
lly undergo a crystallization resplendent with interior light.  Such modificati
ons of the original Will may be observed in the course of the invocations when
they are properly performed.
   The peculiar dangers of each are obvious --- that of the first is a flash in
 the pan --- a misfire; that of the second, a falling into dreaminess or reveri
e; that of the third, loss of concentration.  A mistake in any of these points
will prevent, or injure the proper formation of, the fourth.
   In the expression which will be used in Chapter XV: "Enflame thyself", etc.,
 only the first stage is specified; but if that is properly done the other stag
es will follow as if by necessity.  So far is  it written concerning the formul
a of Tetragrammaton.  {23}






                             CHAPTER IV.

                THE FORMULA OF ALHIM, AND THAT OF ALIM.

  "ALHIM", (Elohim) is the exoteric word for Gods.>  It is the masculine plural
 of a feminine noun, but its nature is principally feminine.> It is a perfect h
ieroglyph of the number 5.  This should be studied in "A Note on Genesis" (Equi
nox I, II).
   The Elements are all represented, as in Tetragrammaton, but there is no deve
lopment from one into the others.  They are, as it were, thrown together --- un
tamed, only sympathising by virtue of their wild and stormy  but elastically re
sistless energy.  The Central letter is "He" --- the letter of breath --- and r
epresents Spirit.  The first letter "Aleph" is the natural letter of Air, and t
he Final "Mem" is the natural letter of Water.  Together, "Aleph" and "Mem" mak
e "Am" --- the mother within whose womb the Cosmos is conceived.  But "Yod" is
not the natural letter of Fire.  Its juxtaposition with "He" sanctifies that fi
re to the "Yod" of Tetragrammaton.  Similarly we find "Lamed" for Earth, where
we should expect Tau --- in order to emphasize the influence of Venus, who rule
s Libra.
   "ALHIM", therefore, represents rather the formula of Consecration than that
of a complete ceremony.  It is the breath of benediction, yet so potent that it
 can give life to clay and light to darkness.
   In consecrating a weapon, "Aleph" is the whirling force of the thunderbolt,
the lightning which flameth out of the East even {24} into the West.  This is t
he gift of the wielding of the thunderbolt of Zeus or Indra, the god of Air.  "
Lamed" is the Ox-goad, the driving force; and it is also the Balance, represent
ing the truth and love of the Magician.  It is the loving care which he bestows
 upon perfecting his instruments, and the equilibration of that fierce force wh
ich initiates the ceremony.>
   "Yod" is the creative energy -- the procreative power: and yet "Yod" is the
solitude and silence of the hermitage into which the Magician has shut himself.
  "Mem" is the letter of water, and it is the Mem final, whose long flat lines
suggest the Sea at Peace HB:Mem-final ; not the ordinary (initial and medial) M
em whose hieroglyph is a wave HB:Mem.>  And then, in the Centre of all, broods
Spirit, which combines the mildness of the Lamb with the horns of the Ram, and
is the letter of Bacchus or "Christ".>
 After the magician has created his instrument, and balanced it truly, and fill
ed it with the lightnings of his Will, then is the weapon laid away to   rest;
and in this Silence, a true Consecration comes.

                       THE FORMULA OF ALIM

   It is extremely interesting to contrast with the above the formula of the el
emental Gods deprived of the creative spirit.  One {25} might suppose that as A
LIM, is the masculine plural of the masculine noun AL, its formula would be mor
e virile than that of ALHIM, which is the masculine plural of the feminine noun
 ALH.  A moment's investigation is sufficient to dissipate the illusion.  The w
ord masculine has no meaning except in relation to some feminine correlative.
   The word ALIM may in fact be considered as neuter.  By a rather absurd conve
ntion, neuter objects are treated as feminine on account of their superficial r
esemblance in passivity and inertness with the unfertilized female.  But the fe
male produces life by the intervention of the male, while the neuter does so on
ly when impregnated by Spirit.  Thus we find the feminine AMA, becoming AIMA>,
through the operation of the phallic Yod, while ALIM, the congress of dead elem
ents, only fructifies by the brooding of Spirit.
 This being so, how can we describe ALIM as containing a Magical Formula? Inqui
ry discloses the fact that this formula is of a very special kind.
 The word adds up to 81, which is a number of the moon.  It is thus the formula
 of witchcraft, which is under Hecate.>  It is only the romantic mediaeval perv
ersion of science that represents young women as partaking in witchcraft, which
 is, properly speaking, restricted to the use of such women as are no longer wo
men in the Magical sense of the word, because thy are no longer capable of corr
esponding to the formula of the male, and are therefore neuter rather than femi
nine.  It is for this reason that their method has always been referred to the
moon, in that sense of the term in which she appears, not as the feminine corre
lative of the sun, but as the burnt-out, dead, airless satellite of earth.
   No true Magical operation can be performed by the formula of ALIM.  All the
works of witchcraft are illusory; and their apparent effects depend on the idea
 that it is possible to alter things by the mere rearrangement of them.  One {2
6} must not rely upon the false analogy of the Xylenes to rebut this argument.
 It is quite true that geometrical isomers act in different manners towards the
 substance to which they are brought into relation.  And it is of course necess
ary sometimes to rearrange the elements of a molecule before that molecule can
form either the masculine or the feminine element in a true Magical combination
 with some other molecule.
   It is therefore occasionally inevitable for a Magician to reorganize the str
ucture of certain elements before proceeding to his operation proper.  Although
 such work is technically witchcraft, it must not be regarded as undesirable on
 that ground, for all operations which do not transmute matter fall strictly sp
eaking under this heading.
   The real objection to this formula is not inherent in its own nature.  Witch
craft consists in treating it as the exclusive preoccupation of Magick, and esp
ecially in denying to the Holy Spirit his right to indwell His Temple.> {27}






                              CHAPTER V

                        The Formula of I.A.O.

   This formula is the  principal and most characteristic formula of Osiris, of
 the Redemption of Mankind.  "I" is Isis, Nature, ruined by "A", Apophis the De
stroyer, and restored to life by the Redeemer Osiris.>  The same idea is expres
sed by the Rosicrucian formula of the Trinity:
       "Ex Deo nascimur.
       In Jesu Morimur
       Per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus."
 This is also identical with the Word Lux, L.V.X., which is formed by the arms
of a cross.  It is this formula which is implied in those ancient and modern mo
numents in which the phallus is worshipped as the Saviour of the World.
   The doctrine of resurrection as vulgarly understood is false and absurd.  It
 is not even "Scriptural".  St. Paul does not identify the glorified body which
 rises with the mortal body which dies.  On the contrary, he repeatedly insists
 on the distinction.
   The same is true of a magical ceremony.  The magician who is destroyed by ab
sorption in the Godhead is really destroyed.  The {28} miserable mortal automat
on remains in the Circle.  It is of no more consequence to Him that the dust of
 the floor.>
   But before entering into the details of "I.A.O." as a magick formula it shou
ld be remarked that it is essentially the formula of Yoga or meditation; in fac
t, of elementary mysticism in all its branches.
 In beginning a meditation practice, there is always> a quiet pleasure, a gentl
e natural growth; one takes a lively interest in the work; it seems easy; one i
s quite pleased to have started.  This stage represents Isis.  Sooner or later
it is succeeded by depression --- the Dark Night of the Soul, an infinite weari
ness and detestation of the work.  The simplest and easiest acts become almost
impossible to perform.  Such impotence fills the mind with apprehension and des
pair.  The intensity of this loathing can hardly be understood by any person wh
o has not experienced it.  This is the period of Apophis.
   It is followed by the arising not of Isis, but of Osiris.  The ancient condi
tion is not restored, but a new and superior condition is created, a condition
only rendered possible by the process of death.
   The Alchemists themselves taught this same truth.  The first matter of the w
ork was base and primitive, though "natural".  After passing through various st
ages the "black dragon" appeared; but from this arose the pure and perfect gold
.
 Even in the legend of Prometheus we find an identical formula concealed; and a
 similar remark applies to those of Jesus Christ, and of many other mythical go
d-men worshipped in different countries.>
   A magical ceremony constructed on this formula is thus in close essential ha
rmony with the natural mystic process.  We find it the {29} basis of many impor
tant initiations, notably the Third Degree in Masonry, and the 5 Degree = 6Squa
re ceremony of the G.'. D.'. described in Equinox I, III.  A ceremonial self-in
itiation may be constructed with advantage on this formula.  The essence of it
consists in robing yourself as a king, then stripping and slaying yourself, and
 rising from that death to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian
Angel>.  There is an etymological identity between Tetragrammaton and "I A O",
but the magical formulae are entirely different, as the descriptions here given
 have schewn.
   Professor William James, in his "Varieties of Religious Experience," has wel
l classified religion as the "once-born" and the "twice-born"; but the religion
 now proclaimed in Liber Legis harmonizes these by transcending them.  There is
 no attempt to get rid of death by denying it, as among the once-born; nor to a
ccept death as the gate of a new life, as among the twice-born.  With the A.'.
A.'. life and death are equally incidents in a career, very much like day and n
ight in the history of a planet.  But, to pursue the simile, we regard this pla
net from afar.  A Brother of A.'. A.'. looks at (what another person would call
) "himself", as one --- or, rather, some --- among a group of phenomena.  He is
 that "nothing" whose consciousness is in one sense the universe considered as
a single phenomenon in time and space, and in another sense is the negation of
that consciousness.  The body and mind of the man are only important (if at all
) as the telescope of the astronomer to him.  If the telescope were destroyed i
t would make no appreciable difference to the Universe which that telescope rev
eals.
   It will now be understood that this formula of I A O is a formula of Tiphare
th.  The magician who employs it is conscious of himself as a man liable to suf
fering, and anxious to transcend that state by becoming one with god.  It will
appear to him as the Supreme Ritual, as the final step; but, as has already bee
n {30} pointed out, it is but a preliminary.  For the normal man today, however
, it represents considerable attainment; and there is a much earlier formula wh
ose investigation will occupy Chapter VI.
   THE MASTER THERION, in the Seventeenth year of the Aeon, has reconstructed t
he Word I A O to satisfy the new conditions of Magick imposed by progress.  The
 Word of the Law being Thelema, whose number is 93, this number should be the c
anon of a corresponding Mass.  Accordingly, he has expanded I A O by treating t
he O as an Ayin, and then adding Vau as prefix and affix.  The full word is the
n

 Vau Yod Aleph Ayin Vau

whose number is 93.  We may analyse this new Word in detail and demonstrate tha
t it is a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of Self-Initiation in this Aeon of Ho
rus.  For the correspondence in the following note, see Liber 777.  The princip
al points are these: {31}

   "Aeon of Isis." Matriarchal Age.  The Great Work conceived as a straightforw
ard simple affair.
   We find the theory reflected in the customs of Matriarchy.  Parthenogenesis
is supposed to be true.  The Virgin (Yod-Virgo) contains in herself the Princip
le of Growth --- the epicene Hermetic seed.  It becomes the Babe in the Egg (A
--- Harpocrates) by virtue of the Spirit (A = Air, impregnating the Mother---Vu
lture) and this becomes the Sun or Son ( Digamma = the letter of Tiphareth, 6,
even when spelt as Omega, in Coptic.  See 777).
   "Aeon of Osiris."  Patriarchal age.  Two sexes.  I conceived as the Father-W
and.  (Yod in Tetragrammaton).  A the Babe is pursued by the Dragon, who casts
a flood from his mouth to swallow it.  See "Rev." VII.  The Dragon is also the
Mother --- the "Evil Mother" of Freud.  It is Harpocrates, threatened by the cr
ocodile in the Nile.  We find the symbolism of the Ark, the Coffin of Osiris, e
tc.  The Lotus is the Yoni; the Water the Amniotic Fluid.  In order to live his
 own life, the child must leave the Mother, and overcome the temptation to retu
rn to her for refuge.  Kundry, Armida, Jocasta, Circe, etc., are symbols of thi
s force which tempts the Hero.  He may take her as his servant> when he has mas
tered her, so as to heal his father (Amfortas), avenge him (Osiris), or pacify
him (Jehovah).  But in order to grow to manhood, he must cease to depend on her
, earning the Lance (Parzival), claiming his arms (Achilles), or making his clu
b (Hercules)>, and wander in the waterless wilderness like Krishna, Jesus, Oedi
pus,  chi.  tau.  lambda. --- until the hour when, as the "King's Son" or knigh
t-errant, he must win the Princess, and set himself upon a strange throne.  Alm
ost all the legends of heroes imply this formula in strikingly similar symbols.
   Digamma.  Vau the Sun --- Son.  He is supposed to be mortal; but how is this
 shewn?  It seems an absolute perversion of truth: the sacred symbols have no h
int of it.  This lie is the essence of the Great Sorcery.  Osirian religion is
a Freudian phantasy fashioned of man's dread of death and ignorance of nature.
 The parthenogenesis-idea {34} persists, but is now the formula for incarnating
 demi-gods, or divine kings; these must be slain and raised from the dead in on
e way or another.>
"Aeon of Horus."  Two sexes in one person.
 Digamma Iota Alpha Omicron Digamma:  93, the full formula, recognizing the Sun
 as the Son (Star), as the pre-existent manifested Unit from which all springs
and to which all returns.  The Great Work is to make the initial  Digamma Digam
ma of Assiah (The world of material illusion) into the final  Digamma Iota Diga
mma of Atziluth,> the world of pure reality.
Spelling the Name in full,  Digamma Digamma +  Iota Digamma Delta +  Alpha Lamb
da Pi +  Omicron Iota Nu + Digamma Iota = 309 = Sh T = XX + XI = 31 the secret
Key of the Law.
Digamma is the manifested Star.
Iota is the secret Life .............. Serpent
          ---      Light ............. Lamp
          ---      Love .............. Wand
          ---      Liberty ........... Wings
          ---      Silence ........... Cloak
     These symbols are all shewn in the Atu "The Hermit".
     They are the powers of the Yod, whose extension is the Vau.
     Yod is the Hand wherewith man does his Will.  It is also
     The Virgin; his essence is inviolate.
Alpha is the Babe "who has formulated his Father, and made fertile
      his Mother" --- Harpocrates, etc., as before; but he develops
      to
Omicron  The exalted "Devil" (also the "other" secret Eye) by the
         formula of the Initiation of Horus elsewhere described in
         detail.  This "Devil" is called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with ho
rror by people who are ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be
 evil, accuse Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime.  Satan is Saturn, S
et, Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc.  The most serious charge a
gainst him is that he is the Sun in the South.  The Ancient Initiates, {35} dwe
lling as they did in lands whose blood was the water of the Nile or the Euphrat
es, connected the South with life-withering heat, and cursed that quarter where
 the solar darts were deadliest.  Even in the legend of Hiram, it is at high no
on that he is stricken down and slain.  Capricornus is moreover the sign which
the sun enterers when he reaches his extreme Southern declination at the Winter
 Solstice, the season of the death of vegetation, for the folk of the Northern
hemisphere.  This gave them a second cause for cursing the south.  A third; the
 tyranny of hot, dry, poisonous winds; the menace of deserts or oceans dreadful
 because mysterious and impassable; these also were connected in their minds wi
th the South.  But to us, aware of astronomical facts, this antagonism to the S
outh is a silly superstition which the accidents of their local conditions sugg
ested to our animistic ancestors.  We see no enmity between Right and Left, Up
and Down, and similar pairs of opposites.  These antitheses are real only as a
statement of relation; they are the conventions of an arbitrary device for repr
esenting our ideas in a pluralistic symbolism based on duality.  "Good" must be
 defined in terms of human ideals and instincts.  "East" has no meaning except
with reference to the earth's internal affairs; as an absolute direction in spa
ce it changes a degree every four minutes.  "Up" is the same for no two men, un
less one chance to be in the line joining the other with the centre of the eart
h.  "Hard" is the private opinion of our muscles.  "True" is an utterly unintel
ligible epithet which has proved refractory to the analysis of our ablest philo
sophers.
   We have therefore no scruple in restoring the "devil-worship" of such ideas
as those which the laws of sound, and the phenomena of speech and hearing, comp
el us to connect with the group of "Gods" whose names are based upon Sht, or D,
 vocalized by the free breath A.  For these Names imply the qualities of courag
e, frankness, energy, pride, power and triumph; they are the words which expres
s the creative and paternal will.
 Thus "the Devil" is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiest mountain
s, the Godhead which, if it become manifest in man, makes him Aegipan, the All.
   The Sun enters this sign when he turns to renew the year in the North.  He i
s also the vowel O, proper to roar, to boom, and {36} to command, being a forci
ble breath controlled by the firm circle of the mouth.
   He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, before whom all shadows flee away: al
so that Secret Eye which makes an image of its God, the Light, and gives it pow
er to utter oracles, enlightening the mind.
 Thus, he is Man made God, exalted, eager; he has come consciously to his full
stature, and so is ready to set out on his journey to redeem the world.  But he
 may not appear in this true form; the Vision of Pan would drive men mad with f
ear.  He must conceal Himself in his original guise.
 He therefore becomes apparently the man that he was at the beginning; he lives
 the life of a man; indeed, he is wholly man.  But his initiation has made him
master of the Event by giving him the understanding that whatever happens to hi
m is the execution of this true will.  Thus the last stage of his initiation is
 expressed in our formula as the final:
Digamma --- The series of transformations has not affected his identity; but it
 has explained him to himself.  Similarly, Copper is still Copper after
Cu+O = CuO:+H SO =CuS O(H O):+K S=CuS(K SO ):
             2  4    4   2     2       2  4     + blowpipe and reducing agent =
 Cu(S).
   It is the same copper, but we have learnt some of its properties.  We observ
e especially that it is indestructible, inviolably itself throughout all its ad
ventures, and in all its disguises.  We see moreover that it can only make use
of its powers, fulfill the possibilities of its nature, and satisfy its equatio
ns, by thus combining with its counterparts.  Its existence as a separate subst
ance is evidence of its subjection to stress; and this is felt as the ache of a
n incomprehensible yearning until it realises that every experience is a relief
, an expression of itself; and that it cannot be injured by aught that may befa
ll it.  In the Aeon of Osiris it was indeed realised that Man must die in order
 to live.  But now in the Aeon of Horus we know that every event is a death; su
bject and object slay each other in "love under will"; each such death is itsel
f life, the means by which one realises oneself in a series of episodes.
   The second main point is the completion of the A babe Bacchus by the O Pan (
Parzival wins the Lance, etc.).  {37}
   The first process is to find the I in the V --- initiation, purification, fi
nding the Secret Root of oneself, the epicene Virgin who is 10 (Malkuth) but sp
elt in full 20 (Jupiter).
   This Yod in the "Virgin" expands to the Babe in the Egg by formulating the S
ecret Wisdom of Truth of Hermes in the Silence of the Fool.  He acquires the Ey
e-Wand, beholding the acting and being adored.  The Inverted Pentagram --- Baph
omet --- the Hermaphrodite fully grown --- begets himself on himself as V again
.
   Note that there are now two sexes in one person throughout, so that each ind
ividual is self-procreative sexually, whereas Isis knew only one sex, and Osiri
s thought the two sexes opposed.  Also the formula is now Love in all cases; an
d the end is the beginning, on a higher plane.
   The I is formed from the V by removing its tail, the A by balancing 4 Yods,
the O by making an inverted triangle of Yods, which suggests the formula of Nui
t --- Hadit --- Ra-Hoor-Khuit.  A is the elements whirling as a Svastika --- th
e creative Energy in equilibrated action.>

                           CHAPTER VI

                THE FORMULA OF THE NEOPHYTE>.

   This formula has for its "first matter" the ordinary man entirely ignorant o
f everything and incapable of anything.  He is therefore represented as blindfo
lded and bound.  His only aid is his aspiration, represented by the officer who
 is to lead him into the Temple.  Before entering, he must be purified and cons
ecrated.  Once within the Temple, he is required to bind himself by an oath.  H
is aspiration is now formulated as Will.  He makes the mystic circumambulation
of the Temple for the reasons to be described in the Chapter on "Gesture".  Aft
er further purification and consecration, he is allowed for one moment to see t
he Lord of the West, and gains courage> to persist.  For the third time he is p
urified and consecrated, and he sees the Lord of the East, who holds the balanc
e, keeping him in a straight line.  In the West he gains energy.  In the East h
e is prevented from dissipating the same.  So fortified, he may be received int
o the Order as a neophyte by the three principal officers, thus uniting the Cro
ss with the Triangle.  He may then be placed between the pillars of the Temple,
 to receive the fourth and final consecration.  In this position the secrets of
 the grade are communicated to him, and the last of his fetters is removed.  Al
l this is sealed by the sacrament of the Four Elements.
   It will be seen that the effect of this whole ceremony is to endow a thing i
nert and impotent with balanced motion in a given direction.  Numerous example
of this formula are given {39} in Equinox I, Nos. II and III.  It is the formul
a of the Neophyte Ceremony of G.'. D.'.  It should be employed in the consecrat
ion of the actual weapons used by the magician, and may also be used as the fir
st formula of initiation.
   In the book called Z 2> (Equinox I, III) are given full details of this form
ula, which cannot be too carefully studied and practised.  It is unfortunately,
 the most complex of all of them.  But this is the fault of the first matter of
 the work, which is so muddled that many operations are required to unify it.

                             CHAPTER VII

                   THE FORMULA OF THE HOLY GRAAL:

                                 OF

                             ABRAHADABRA:

                    "and of certain other Words."

                      Also: THE MAGICAL MEMORY.

   The Hieroglyph shewn in the Seventh Key of the Tarot (described in the 12th
Aethyr, Liber 418, Equinox I, V) is the Charioteer of OUR LADY BABALON, whose C
up or Graal he hears.
   Now this is an important formula.  It is the First of the Formulae, in a sen
se, for it is the formula of Renunciation.>  It is also the Last!
   This Cup is said to be full of the Blood of the Saints; that is, every "sain
t" or magician must give the last drop of his life's blood to that cup.  It is
the original price paid for magick power.  And if by magick power we mean the t
rue power, the assimilation of all force with the Ultimate Light, the true Brid
al of the Rosy Cross, then is that blood the offering of Virginity, the sole sa
crifice well-pleasing to the Master, the sacrifice whose only reward is the pai
n of child-bearing unto him.
 But "to sell one's soul to the devil", to renounce no matter what for an equiv
alent in personal gain>, is black magic.  You are no longer a noble giver of yo
ur all, but a mean huckster.  {41}
   This formula is, however, a little different in symbolism, since it is a Wom
an whose Cup must be filled.  It is rather the sacrifice of the Man, who transf
ers life to his descendants.  For a woman does not carry in herself the princip
le of new life, except temporarily, when it is given her.
   But here the formula implies much more even than this.  For it is his whole
life that the Magus offers to OUR LADY.  The Cross is both Death and Generation
, and it is on the Cross that the Rose blooms.  The full significance of these
symbols is so lofty that it is hardly fitted for an elementary treatise of this
 type.  One must be an Exempt Adept, and have become ready to pass on, before o
ne can see the symbols even from the lower plane.  Only a Master of the Temple
can fully understand them.
   (However, the reader may study Liber CLVI, in Equinox I, VI, the 12th and 2n
d Aethyrs in Liber 418 in Equinox I, V, and the Symbolism of the V Degree and V
I Degree in O.T.O.)
   Of the preservation of this blood which OUR LADY offers to the ANCIENT ONE,
CHAOS> the All-Father, to revive him, and of how his divine Essence fills the D
aughter (the soul of Man) and places her upon the Throne of the Mother, fulfill
ing the Economy of the Universe, and thus ultimately rewarding the Magician (th
e Son) ten thousandfold, it would be still more improper to speak in this place
.  So holy a mystery is the Arcanum of the Masters of the Temple, that it is he
re hinted at in order to blind the presumptuous who may, unworthy, seek to lift
 the veil, and at the same time to lighten the darkness of such as may be requi
ring only one ray of the Sun in order to spring into life and light.

                                II

   ABRAHADABRA is a word to be studied in Equinox I, V., "The Temple of Solomon
 the King".  It represents the Great Work complete, and it is therefore an arch
etype of all lesser magical operations.  It is in a way too perfect to be appli
ed in {42} advance to any of them.  But an example of such an operation may be
studied in Equinox I, VII, "The Temple of Solomon the King", where an invocatio
n of Horus on this formula is given in full.  Note the reverberation of the ide
as one against another.  The formula of Horus has not yet been so fully worked
out in details as to justify a treatise upon its exoteric theory and practice;
but one may say that it is, to the formula of Osiris, what the turbine is to th
e reciprocating engine.

                              III

   There are many other sacred words which enshrine formulae of great efficacit
y in particular operations.
   For example, V.I.T.R.I.O.L. gives a certain Regimen of the Planets useful in
 Alchemical work.  Ararita is a formula of the macrocosm potent in certain very
 lofty Operations of the Magick of the Inmost Light.  (See Liber 813.)
   The formula of Thelema may be summarized thus: Theta "Babalon and the Beast
conjoined" --- epsilon unto Nuith (CCXX, I, 51) --- lambda The Work accomplishe
d in Justice --- eta The Holy Graal --- mu The Water therein --- alpha The Babe
 in the Egg (Harpocrates on the Lotus.)
   That of "Agape" is as follows:
   Dionysus (Capital Alpha) --- The Virgin Earth gamma --- The Babe in the Egg
(small alpha --- the image of the Father) --- The Massacre of the Innocents, pi
 (winepress) --- The Draught of Ecstasy, eta.
   The student will find it well worth his while to seek out these ideas in det
ail, and develop the technique of their application.
   There is also the Gnostic Name of the Seven Vowels, which gives a musical fo
rmula most puissant in evocations of the Soul of Nature.  There is moreover ABR
AXAS; there is XNOUBIS; there is MEITHRAS; and indeed it may briefly be stated
that every true name of God gives the formula of the invocation of that God.>
It would therefore be impossible, even were it desirable, to analyse all such n
ames.  The general method of doing so has been {43} given, and the magician mus
t himself work out his own formula for particular cases.>

                             IV.

   It should also be remarked that every grade has its peculiar magical formula
.  Thus, the formula of Abrahadabra concerns us, as men, principally because ea
ch of us represents the pentagram or microcosm; and our equilibration must ther
efore be with the hexagram or macrocosm.  In other words, 5 Degree = 6Square is
 the formula of the Solar operation; but then 6 Degree = 5Square is the formula
 of the Martial operation, and this reversal of the figures implies a very diff
erent Work.  In the former instance the problem was to dissolve the microcosm i
n the macrocosm; but this other problem is to separate a particular force from
the macrocosm, just as a savage might hew out a flint axe from the deposits in
a chalk cliff.  Similarly, an operation of Jupiter will be of the nature of the
 equilibration of him with Venus.  Its graphic formula will be 7 Degree = 4Squa
re, and there will be a word in which the character of this operation is descri
bed, just as Abrahadabra describes the Operation of the Great Work.
   It may be stated without unfairness, as a rough general principle, that the
farther from original equality are the two sides of the equation, the more diff
icult is the operation to perform.
   Thus, to take the case of the personal operation symbolized by the grades, i
t is harder to become a Neophyte, 1 Degree = 10Square, than to pass from that g
rade to Zelator, 2 Degree = 9Square.
   Initiation is, therefore, progressively easier, in a certain sense, after th
e first step is taken.  But (especially after the passing of Tiphareth) the dis
tance between grade and grade increases as it were by a geometrical progression
 with an enormously high factor, which itself progresses.> {44}
   It is evidently impossible to give details of all these formulae.  Before be
ginning any operation soever the magician must make a through Qabalistic study
of it so as to work out its theory in symmetry of perfection.  Preparedness in
Magick is as important as it is in War.

                              V

 It should be profitable to make a somewhat detailed study of the strange-looki
ng word AUMGN, for its analysis affords an excellent illustration of the princi
ples on which the Practicus may construct his own Sacred Words.
 This word has been uttered by the MASTER THERION himself, as a means of declar
ing his own personal work as the Beast, the Logos of the Aeon.  To understand i
t, we must make a preliminary consideration of the word which it replaces and f
rom which it was developed: the word AUM.
   The word AUM is the sacred Hindu mantra which was the supreme hieroglyph of
Truth, a compendium of the Sacred Knowledge.  Many volumes have been written wi
th regard to it; but, for our present purpose, it will be necessary only to exp
lain how it came to serve for the representation of the principal philosophical
 tenets of the Rishis.  {45}
   Firstly, it represents the complete course of sound.  It is pronounced by fo
rcing the breath from the back of the throat with the mouth wide open, through
the buccal cavity with the lips so shaped as to modify the sound from A to O (o
r U), to the closed lips, when it becomes M.  Symbolically, this announces the
course of Nature as proceeding from free and formless creation through controll
ed and formed preservation to the silence of destruction.  The three sounds are
 harmonized into one; and thus the word represents the Hindu Trinity of Brahma,
 Vishnu, and Shiva; and the operations in the Universe of their triune energy.
 It is thus the formula of a Manvantara, or period of manifested existence, whi
ch alternates with a Pralaya, during which creation is latent.
   Analysed Qabalistically, the word is found to possess similar properties.  A
 is the negative, and also the unity which concentrates it into a positive form
.  A is the Holy Spirit who begets God in flesh upon the Virgin, according to t
he formula familiar to students of "The Golden Bough".  A is also the "babe in
the Egg" thus produced.  The quality of A is thus bisexual.  It is the original
 being --- Zeus Arrhenothelus, Bacchus Diphues, or Baphomet.
   U or V is the manifested son himself.  Its number is 6.  It refers therefore
, to the dual nature of the Logos as divine and human; the interlacing of the u
pright and averse triangles in the hexagram.  It is the first number of the Sun
, whose last number> is 666, "the number of a man".
   The letter M exhibits the termination of this process.  It is the Hanged Man
 of the Tarot; the formation of the individual from the absolute is closed by h
is death.
   We see accordingly how AUM is, on either system, the expression of a dogma w
hich implies catastrophe in nature.  It is cognate with the formula of the Slai
n God.  The "resurrection" and "ascension" are not implied in it.  They are lat
er inventions without basis in necessity; they may be described indeed as Freud
ian phantasms conjured up by the fear of facing reality.  To {46} the Hindu, in
deed, they are still less respectable.  in his view, existence is essentially o
bjectionable>; and his principle concern is to invoke Shiva> to destroy the ill
usion whose thrall is the curse of the Manvantara.
   The cardinal revelation of the Great Aeon of Horus is that this formula AUM
does not represent the facts of nature.  The point of view is based upon misapp
rehension of the character of existence.  It soon became obvious to The Master
Therion that AUM was an inadequate and misleading hieroglyph.  It stated only p
art of the truth, and it implied a fundamental falsehood.  He consequently dete
rmined to modify the word in such a manner as to fit it to represent the Arcana
 unveiled by the Aeon of which He had attained to be the Logos.
 The essential task was to emphasize the fact that nature is not catastrophic,
but proceeds by means of undulations.  It might be suggested that Manvantara an
d Pralaya are in reality complementary curves; but the Hindu doctrine insists s
trongly on denying continuity to the successive phases.  It was nevertheless im
portant to avoid disturbing the Trinitarian arrangement of the word, as would b
e done by the addition of other letters.  It was equally desirable to make it c
lear that the letter M represents an operation which does not actually occur in
 nature except as the withdrawal of phenomena into the absolute; which process,
 even when so understood, is not a true destruction, but, on the contrary, the
emancipation of anything from the modifications which it had mistaken for itsel
f.  It occurred to him that the true nature of Silence was to permit the uninte
rrupted vibration of the undulatory energy, free from the false conceptions att
ached to it by the Ahamkara or Ego-making facility, whose assumption that consc
ious individuality constitutes existence let it to consider its own apparently
catastrophic character as pertaining to the order of nature. {47}
   The undulatory formula of putrefaction is represented in the Qabalah by the
letter N, which refers to Scorpio, whose triune nature combines the Eagle, Snak
e and Scorpion.  These hieroglyphs themselves indicate the spiritual formulae o
f incarnation.  He was also anxious to use the letter G, another triune formula
 expressive of the aspects of the moon, which further declares the nature of hu
man existence in the following manner.  The moon is in itself a dark orb; but a
n appearance of light is communicated to it by the sun; and it is exactly in th
is way that successive incarnations create the appearance, just as the individu
al star, which every man is, remains itself, irrespective of whether earth perc
eives it or not.
   Now it so happens that the root GN signifies both knowledge and generation c
ombined in a single idea, in an absolute form independent of personality.  The
G is a silent letter, as in our word Gnosis; and the sound GN is nasal, suggest
ing therefore the breath of life as opposed to that of speech.  Impelled by the
se considerations, the Master Therion proposed to replace the M of AUM by a com
pound letter MGN, symbolizing thereby the subtle transformation of the apparent
 silence and death which terminates the manifested life of Vau by a continuous
vibration of an impersonal energy of the nature of generation and knowledge, th
e Virgin Moon and the Serpent furthermore operating to include in the idea a co
mmemoration of the legend so grossly deformed in the Hebrew legend of the Garde
n of Eden, and its even more malignantly debased falsification in that bitterly
 sectarian broadside, the Apocalypse.
   Sound work invariable vindicates itself by furnishing confirmatory corollari
es not contemplated by the Qabalist.  In the present instance, the Master Theri
on was delighted to remark that his compound letter MGN, constructed on theoret
ical principles with the idea of incorporating the new knowledge of the Aeon, h
ad the value of 93 (M = 40, G = 3, N = 50).  93 is the number of the word of th
e Law --- Thelema --- Will, and of Agape --- Love, which indicates the nature o
f Will.  It is furthermore the number of the Word which overcomes death, as mem
bers of the degree of M M of the O.T.O. are well aware;> and it is also that of
 the complete formula of existence as expressed in the {48} True Word of the Ne
ophyte,> where existence is taken to import that phase of the whole which is th
e finite resolution of the Qabalistic Zero.
   Finally, the total numeration of the Word AUMGN is 100, which, as initiates
of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the O.T.O.> are taught, expresses the unity u
nder the form of complete manifestation by the symbolism of pure number, being
Kether by Aiq Bkr>; also Malkuth multiplied by itself>, and thus established in
 the phenomenal universe.  But, moreover, this number 100 mysteriously indicate
s the Magical formula of the Universe as a reverberatory engine for the extensi
on of Nothingness through the device of equilibrated opposites.>
   It is moreover the value of the letter Qoph, which means "the back of the he
ad", the cerebellum, where the creative or reproductive force is primarily situ
ated.  Qoph in the Tarot is "the Moon", a card suggesting illusion, yet shewing
 counterpartal forces operating in darkness, and the Winged Beetle or Midnight
Sun in his Bark travelling through the Nadir.  Its Yetziratic attribution is Pi
sces, symbolic of the positive and negative currents of fluidic energy, the mal
e Ichthus or "Pesce" and the female Vesica, seeking respectively the anode and
kathode.  The number 100 is therefore a synthetic glyph of the subtle energies
employed in creating the Illusion, or Reflection of Reality, which we call mani
fested existence.
   The above are the principal considerations in the matter of AUMGN.  They sho
uld suffice to illustrate to the student the methods employed in the constructi
on of the hieroglyphics of Magick, and to arm him with a mantra of terrific pow
er by virtue whereof he may apprehend the Universe, and    control in himself i
ts Karmic consequences.  {49}

                        THE MAGICAL MEMORY.>

                                 I

 There is no more important task than the exploration of one's previous incarna
tions>.  As Zoroaster says: "Explore the river of the soul; whence and in what
order thou has come." One cannot do one's True Will intelligently unless one kn
ows what it is.  Liber Thisarb, Equinox I, VII, give instructions for determini
ng this by calculating the resultant of the forces which have made one what one
 is.  But this practice is confined to one's present incarnation.
   If one were to wake up in a boat on a strange river, it would be rash to con
clude that the direction of the one reach visible was that of the whole stream.
  It would help very much if one remembered the bearings of previous reaches tr
aversed before one's nap.  It would further relieve one's anxiety when one beca
me aware that a uniform and constant force was the single determinant of all th
e findings of the stream: gravitation.  We could rejoice "that even the wearies
t river winds somewhere safe to sea."
 Liber Thisarb describes a method of obtaining the Magical Memory by learning t
o remember backwards.  But the careful {50} practice of Dharana is perhaps more
 generally useful.  As one prevents the more accessible thoughts from arising,
we strike deeper strata --- memories of childhood reawaken.  Still deeper lies
a class of thoughts whose origin puzzles us.  Some of these apparently belong t
o former incarnations.  By cultivating these departments of one's mind we can d
evelop them; we become expert; we form an organized coherence of these original
ly disconnected elements; the faculty grows with astonishing rapidity, once the
 knack of the business is mastered.
   It is much easier (for obvious reasons) to acquire the Magical Memory when o
ne has been sworn for many lives to reincarnate immediately.  The great obstacl
e is the phenomenon called Freudian forgetfulness; that is to say, that, though
 an unpleasant event may be recorded faithfully enough by the mechanism of the
brain, we fail to recall it, or recall it wrong, because it is painful.  "The P
sychopathology of Everyday Life" analyses and illustrates this phenomenon in de
tail.  Now, the King of Terrors being Death, it is hard indeed to look it in th
e face.  Mankind has created a host of phantastic masks; people talk of "going
to heaven", "passing over", and so on; banners flaunted from pasteboard towers
of baseless theories.  One instinctively flinches from remembering one's last,
as one does from imagining one's next, death.>  The point of view of the initia
te helps one immensely.
 As soon as one has passed this Pons Asinorum, the practice becomes much easier
.  It is much less trouble to reach the life before the last; familiarity with
death breeds contempt for it.
   It is a very great assistance to the beginner if he happens to have some int
ellectual grounds for identifying himself with some definite person in the imme
diate past.  A brief account of Aleister Crowley's good fortune in this matter
should be instructive.  It will be seen that the points of contact vary greatly
 in character.

   1. The date of Eliphas Levi's death was about six months previous to that of
 Aleister Crowley's birth.  The reincarnating ego is supposed to take possessio
n of the foetus at about this stage of development. {51}
   2. Eliphas Levi had a striking personal resemblance to Aleister Crowley's fa
ther.  This of course merely suggests a certain degree of suitability from a ph
ysical point of view.
   3. Aleister Crowley wrote a play called "The Fatal Force" at a time when he
had not read any of Eliphas Levi's works.  The motive of this play is a Magical
 Operation of a very peculiar kind.  The formula which Aleister Crowley suppose
d to be his original idea is mentioned by Levi.  We have not been able to trace
 it anywhere else with such exact correspondence in every detail.
   4. Aleister Crowley found a certain quarter of Paris incomprehensibly famili
ar and attractive to him.  This was not the ordinary phenomenon of the "deja vu
", it was chiefly a sense of being at home again.  He discovered long after tha
t Levi had lived in the neighbourhood for many years.
   5. There are many curious similarities between the events of Eliphas Levi's
life and that of Aleister Crowley.  The intention of the parents that their son
 should have a religious career; the inability to make use of very remarkable t
alents in any regular way; the inexplicable ostracism which afflicted him, and
whose authors seemed somehow to be ashamed of themselves; the events relative t
o marriage>: all these offer surprisingly close parallels.
   6. The characters of the two men present subtle identities in many points.
Both seem to be constantly trying to reconcile insuperable antagonisms.  Both f
ind it hard to destroy the delusion that men's fixed beliefs and customs may be
 radically altered by a few friendly explanations.  Both show a curious fondnes
s for out-the-way learning, preferring recondite sources of knowledge they adop
t eccentric appearances.  Both inspire what can only be called panic fear in ab
solute strangers, who can give no reason whatever for a repulsion which sometim
es almost amounts to {52} temporary insanity.  The ruling passion in each case
is that of helping humanity.  Both show quixotic disregard of their personal pr
osperity, and even comfort, yet both display love of luxury and splendour.  Bot
h have the pride of Satan.
   7. When Aleister Crowley became Frater Omicron-Upsilon  Mu-Eta and had to wr
ite his thesis for the grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he had already collected his
ideas when Levi's "Clef des Grands Mysteres" fell into his hands.  It was remar
kable that he, having admired Levi for many years, and even begun to suspect th
e identity, had not troubled (although an extravagant buyer of books) to get th
is particular work.  He found, to his astonishment, that almost everything that
 he had himself intended to say was there written.  The result of this was that
 he abandoned writing his original work, and instead translated the masterpiece
 in question.
   8. The style of the two men is strikingly similar in numerous subtle and dee
p-seated ways.  The general point of view is almost identical.  The quality of
the irony is the same.  Both take a perverse pleasure in playing practical joke
s on the reader.  In one point, above all, the identity is absolute --- there i
s no third name in literature which can be put in the same class.  The point is
 this: In a single sentence is combined sublimity and enthusiasm with sneering
bitterness, scepticism, grossness and scorn.  It is evidently the supreme enjoy
ment to strike a chord composed of as many conflicting elements as possible.  T
he pleasure seems to be derived from gratifying the sense of power, the power t
o compel every possible element of thought to contribute to the spasm.
   If the theory of reincarnation were generally accepted, the above considerat
ions would make out a strong case.  FRATER PERDURABO was quite convinced in one
 part of his mind of this identity, long before he got any actual memories as s
uch.>

                               II

   Unless one has a groundwork of this sort to start with, one must get back to
 one's life as best one can by the methods above indicated.  {53} It may be of
some assistance to give a few characteristics of genuine Magical Memory; to men
tion a few sources of error, and to lay down critical rules for the verificatio
n of one's results.
   The first great danger arises from vanity.  One should always beware of "rem
embering" that one was Cleopatra or Shakespeare.
   Again, superficial resemblances are usually misleading.
   One of the great tests of the genuineness of any recollection is that one re
members the really important things in one's life, not those which mankind comm
only classes as such.  For instance, Aleister Crowley does not remember any of
the decisive events in the life of Eliphas Levi.  He recalls intimate trivialit
ies of childhood.  He has a vivid recollection of certain spiritual crises; in
particular, one which was fought out as he paced up and down a lonely stretch o
f road in a flat and desolate district.  He remembers ridiculous incidents, suc
h as often happen at suppers when the conversation takes a turn such that its g
aiety somehow strikes to the soul, and one receives a supreme revelation which
is yet perfectly inarticulate.  He has forgotten his marriage and its tragic re
sults>, although the plagiarism which Fate has been shameless enough to perpetr
ate in this present life, would naturally, one might think, reopen the wound.
   There is a sense which assures us intuitively when we are running on a scent
 breast high.  There is an "oddness" about the memory which is somehow annoying
.  It gives a feeling of shame and guiltiness.  There is a tendency to blush.
One feels like a schoolboy caught red-handed in the act of writing poetry.  The
re is the same sort of feeling as one has when one finds a faded photograph or
a lock of hair twenty years old among the rubbish in some forgotten cabinet.  T
his feeling is independent of the question whether the thing remembered was in
itself a source of pleasure or of pain.  Can it be that we resent the idea of o
ur "previous condition of servitude"?  We want to forget the past, however good
 reason we may have to be proud of it.  It is well known that many men are emba
rrassed in the presence of a monkey.  {54}
   When the "loss of face" does not occur, distrust the accuracy of the item wh
ich you recall,  The only reliable recollections which present themselves with
serenity are invariably connected with what men call disasters.  Instead of the
 feeling of being caught in the slips, one has that of being missed at the wick
et.  One has the sly satisfaction of having done an outrageously foolish thing
and got off scot free.  When one sees life in perspective, it is an immense rel
ief to discover that things like bankruptcy, wedlock, and the gallows made no p
articular difference.  They were only accidents such as might happen to anybody
; they had no real bearing on the point at issue.  One consequently remembers h
aving one's ears cropped as a lucky escape, while the causal jest of a drunken
skeinsmate in an all-night cafe stings one with the shame of the parvenu to who
m a polite stranger has unsuspectingly mentioned "Mine Uncle".
   The testimony of intuitions is, however, strictly subjective, and shrieks fo
r collateral security.  It would be a great error to ask too much.  In conseque
nce of the peculiar character of the recollections which are under the microsco
pe, anything in the shape of gross confirmation almost presumes perjury.  A pat
hologist would arouse suspicion if he said that his bacilli had arranged themse
lves on the slide so as to spell Staphylococcus.  We distrust an arrangement of
 flowers which tells us that "Life is worth living in Detroit, Michigan".  Supp
ose that Aleister Crowley remembers that he was Sir Edward Kelly.  It does not
follow that he will be able to give us details of Cracow in the time of James I
 of England.  Material events are the words of an arbitrary language; the symbo
ls of a cipher previously agreed on.  What happened to Kelly in Cracow may have
 meant something to him, but there is no reason to presume that it has any mean
ing for his successor.
   There is an obvious line of criticism about any recollection.  It must not c
lash with ascertained facts.  For example --- one cannot have two lives which o
verlap, unless there is reason to suppose that the earlier died spiritually bef
ore his body ceased to breathe.  This might happen in certain cases, such as in
sanity.
   It is not conclusive against a previous incarnation that the present should
be inferior to the past.  One's life may represent the full possibilities of a
certain partial Karma.  One may have {55} devoted one's incarnation to discharg
ing the liabilities of one part of one's previous character.  For instance, one
 might devote a lifetime to settling the bill run up by Napoleon for causing un
necessary suffering, with the object of starting afresh, clear of debt, in a li
fe devoted to reaping the reward of the Corsican's invaluable services to the r
ace.

   The Master Therion, in fact, remembers several incarnations of almost uncomp
ensated wretchedness, anguish and humiliation,  voluntarily undertaken so that
he might resume his work unhampered by spiritual creditors.

   These are the stigmata.  Memory is hall-marked by its correspondence with th
e facts actually observed in the present.  This correspondence may be of two ki
nds.  It is rare (and it is unimportant for the reasons stated above) that one'
s memory should be confirmed by what may be called, contemptuously, external ev
idence.  It was indeed a reliable contribution to psychology to remark that an
evil and adulterous generation sought for a sign.
   (Even so, the permanent value of the observation is to trace the genealogy o
f the Pharisee --- from Caiaphas to the modern Christian.)
   Signs mislead, from "Painless Dentistry" upwards.  The fact that anything is
 intelligible proves that it is addressed to the wrong quarter, because the ver
y existence of language presupposes impotence to communicate directly.  When Wa
lter Raleigh flung his cloak upon the muddy road, he merely expressed, in a cip
her contrived by a combination of circumstances, his otherwise inexpressible wi
sh to get on good terms with Queen Elizabeth.  The significance of his action w
as determined by the concourse of circumstances.  The reality can have no reaso
n for reproducing itself exclusively in that especial form.  It can have no rea
son for remembering that so extravagant a ritual happened to be necessary to wo
rship.  Therefore, however well a man might remember his incarnation as Julius
Caesar, there is no necessity for his representing his power to set all upon th
e hazard of a die by imagining the Rubicon.  Any spiritual state can be symboli
zed by an infinite variety of actions in an infinite variety of circumstances.
 One should recollect only those events which happen to {56} be immediately lin
ked with one's peculiar tendencies to imagine one thing rather than another.>
   Genuine recollections almost invariably explain oneself to oneself.  Suppose
, for example, that you feel an instinctive aversion to some particular kind of
 wine.  Try as you will, you can find no reason for your idiosyncrasy.  Suppose
, then, that when you explore some previous incarnation, you remember that you
died by a poison administered in a wine of that character, your aversion is exp
lained by the proverb, "A burnt child dreads the fire."  It may be objected tha
t in such a case your libido has created a phantasm of itself in the manner whi
ch Freud has explained.  The criticism is just, but its value is reduced if it
should happen that you were not aware of its existence until your Magical Memor
y attracted your attention to it.  In fact, the essence of the test consists in
 this: that your memory notifies you of something which is the logical conclusi
on of the premisses postulated by the past.
   As an example, we may cite certain memories of the Master Therion.  He follo
wed a train of thought which led him to remember his life as a Roman named Mari
us de Aquila.  It would be straining probability to presume a connection betwee
n (alpha) this hieroglyphically recorded mode of self-analysis and (beta) ordin
ary introspection conducted on principles intelligible to himself.  He remember
s directly various people and various events connected with this incarnation; a
nd they are in themselves to all appearance actual.  There is no particular rea
son why they, rather than any others, should have entered his sphere.  In the a
ct of remembering them, they are absolute.  He can find no reason for correlati
ng them with anything in the present.  But a subsequent examination of the reco
rd shows that the logical result of the Work of Marius de Aquila did not occur
to that romantic reprobate; in point of fact, he died before anything could hap
pen.  Can we suppose that any cause can be baulked of effect?  The Universe is
unanimous in rebuttal.  If then the exact effects which might be expected to re
sult from these causes are manifested in the career {57} of the Master Therion,
 it is assuredly the easiest and most reasonable explanation to assume an ident
ity between the two men.  Nobody is shocked to observe that the ambition of Nap
oleon has diminished the average stature of Frenchmen.  We know that somehow or
 other every force must find its fulfilment; and those people who have grasped
the fact that external events are merely symptoms of external ideas, cannot fin
d any difficulty in attributing the correspondences of the one to the identitie
s of the other.
   Far be it from any apologist for Magick to insist upon the objective validit
y of these concatenations!  It would be childish to cling to the belief that Ma
rius de Aquila actually existed; it matters no more that it matters to the math
ematician whether the use of the symbol X to the 22 power  involves the "realit
y" of 22 dimension of space.  The Master Therion does not care a scrap of yeste
rday's newspaper whether he was Marius de Aquila, or whether there ever was suc
h a person, or whether the Universe itself is anything more than a nightmare cr
eated by his own imprudence in the matter of rum and water.  His memory of Mari
us de Aquila, of the adventures of that person in Rome and the Black Forest, ma
tters nothing, either to him or to anybody else.  What matters is this: True or
 false, he has found a symbolic form which has enabled him to govern himself to
 the best advantage.  "Quantum nobis prodest hec fabula Christi!" The "falsity"
 of Aesop's Fables does not diminish their value to mankind.
 The above reduction of the Magical Memory to a device for externalizing one's
interior wisdom need not be regarded as sceptical, save only in the last resort
.  No scientific hypothesis can adduce stronger evidence of its validity than t
he confirmation of its predictions by experimental evidence.  The objective can
 always be expressed in subjective symbols if necessary.  The controversy is ul
timately unmeaning.  However we interpret the evidence, its relative truth depe
nds in its internal coherence.  We may therefore say that any magical recollect
ion is genuine if it gives the explanation of our external or internal conditio
ns.  Anything which throws light upon the Universe, anything which reveals us t
o ourselves, should be welcome in this world of riddles.
   As our record extends into the past, the evidence of its truth is cumulative
.  Every incarnation that we remember must increase {58} our comprehension of o
urselves as we are.  Each accession of knowledge must indicate with unmistakabl
e accuracy the solution of some enigma which is propounded by the Sphynx of our
 own unknown birth-city, Thebes.  The complicated situation in which we find ou
rselves is composed of elements; and no element of it came out of nothing.  New
ton's First Law applies to every plane of thought.  The theory of evolution is
omniform.  There is a reason for one's predisposition to gout, or the shape of
one's ear, in the past.  The symbolism may change; the facts do not.  In one fo
rm or another, everything that exists is derived from some previous manifestati
on.  Have it, if you will, that the memories of other incarnations are dreams;
but dreams are determined by reality just as much as the events of the day.  Th
e truth is to be apprehended by the correct translation of the symbolic languag
e.  The last section of the Oath of the Master of the Temple is: "I swear to in
terpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my soul."  The Mag
ical Memory is (in the last analysis) one manner, and, as experience testifies,
 one of the most important manners, of performing this vow.

                         CHAPTER VIII

           OF EQUILIBRIUM, AND OF THE GENERAL AND PARTICULAR
             METHOD OF PREPARATION OF THE FURNITURE OF THE
                 TEMPLE AND OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF ART.

                               I

   "Before there was equilibrium, countenance beheld not countenance.">  So say
eth the holiest of the Books of the ancient Qabalah.  (Siphra Tzeniutha 1. 2.)
 One countenance here spoken of is the Macrocosm, the other the Microcosm.>
   As said above, the object of any magick ceremony is to unite the Macrocosm a
nd the Microcosm.
   It is as in optics; the angles of incidence and reflection are equal.  You m
ust get your Macrocosm and Microcosm exactly balanced, vertically and horizonta
lly, or the images will not coincide.
   This equilibrium is affirmed by the magician in arranging the Temple.  Nothi
ng must be lop-sided.  If you have anything in the North, you must put somethin
g equal and opposite to it in the South.  The importance of this is so great, a
nd the truth of it so obvious, that no one with the most mediocre capacity {60}
 for magick can tolerate any unbalanced object for a moment.  His instinct inst
antly revolts.>.  For this reason the weapons, altar, circle, and magus are all
 carefully proportioned one with another.  It will not do to have a cup like a
thimble and a wand like a weaver's beam.>
   Again, the arrangement of the weapons of the altar must be such that they "l
ook" balanced.  Nor should the magician have any unbalanced ornament.  If he ha
ve the wand in his right hand, let him have the Ring> on his left, or let him t
ake the Ankh, or the Bell, or the Cup.  And however little he move to the right
, let him balance it by an equivalent movement to the left; or if forwards, bac
kwards; and let him correct each idea by implying the contradictory contained t
herein.  If he invoke Severity, let him recount that Severity is the instrument
 of Mercy;> if Stability, let him show the basis of that Stability to be consta
nt change, just as the stability of a molecule is secured by the momentum of th
e swift atoms contained in it.>
   In this way let every idea go forth as a triangle on the base of two opposit
es, making an apex transcending their contradiction in a higher harmony.
   It is not safe to use any thought in Magick, unless that thought has been th
us equilibrated and destroyed.
   Thus again with the instruments themselves; the Wand must be ready to change
 into a Serpent, the Pantacle into the whirling Svastika or Disk of Jove, as if
 to fulfil the functions of the Sword.  {61} The Cross is both the death of the
 "Saviour"> and the Phallic symbol of Resurrection.  Will itself must be ready
to culminate in the surrender of that Will:> the aspiration's arrow that is sho
t against the Holy Dove must transmute itself into the wondering Virgin that re
ceives in her womb the quickening of that same Spirit of God.
   Any idea that is thus in itself positive and negative, active and passive, m
ale and female, is fit to exist above the Abyss; any idea not so equilibrated i
s below the Abyss, contains in itself an unmitigated duality or falsehood, and
is to that extent qliphotic> and dangerous.  Even an idea like "truth" is unsaf
e unless it is realized that all Truth is in one sense falsehood.  For all Trut
h is relative; and if it be supposed absolute, will mislead.>  "The Book of Lie
s falsely so called" (Liber 333) is worthy of close and careful study in this r
espect.  The reader should also consult Konx Om Pax, "Introduction", and "Thien
 Tao" in the same volume.
   All this is to be expressed in the words of the ritual itself, and symbolise
d in every act performed.

                              II

   It is said in the ancient books of Magick that everything used by the Magici
an must be "virgin".  That is: it must never have been used by any other person
 or for any other purpose.  The {62} greatest importance was attached by the Ad
epts of old to this, and it made the task of the Magician no easy one.  He want
ed a wand; and in order to cut and trim it he needed a knife.  It was not suffi
cient merely to buy a new knife; he felt that he had to make it himself.  In or
der to make the knife, he would require a hundred other things, the acquisition
 of each of which might require a hundred more; and so on.  This shows the impo
ssibility of disentangling one's self from one's environment.  Even in Magick w
e cannot get on without the help of others.>
   There was, however, a further object in this recommendation.  The more troub
le and difficulty your weapon costs, the more useful you will find it.  "If you
 want a thing well done, do it yourself."  It would be quite useless to take th
is book to a department store, and instruct them to furnish you a Temple accord
ing to specification.  It is really worth the while of the Student who requires
 a sword to go and dig out iron ore from the earth, to smelt it himself with ch
arcoal that he has himself prepared, to forge the weapon with his own hand: and
 even to take the trouble of synthesizing the oil of virtiol with which it is e
ngraved.  He will have learnt a lot of useful things in his attempt to make a r
eally virgin sword; he will understand how one thing depends upon another; he w
ill begin to appreciate the meaning of the words "the harmony of the Universe",
 so often used so stupidly and superficially by the ordinary apologist for Natu
re, and he will also perceive the true operation of the law of Karma.>
 Another notable injunction of the ancient Magick was that whatever appertained
 to the Work should be "single".  The Wand was to be cut with a single stroke o
f the knife.  There must be no {63} boggling and hacking at things, no clumsine
ss and no hesitation.  If you strike a blow at all, strike with your strength!
 "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might!"  If you are goi
ng to take up Magick, make no compromise.  You cannot make revolutions with ros
e-water, or wrestle in a silk hat.  You will find very soon that you must eithe
r lose the hat or stop wrestling.  Most people do both.  They take up the magic
al path without sufficient reflection, without that determination of adamant wh
ich made the author of this book exclaim, as he took the first oath, "PERDURABO
" --- "I will endure unto the end!">  They start on it at a great pace, and the
n find that their boots are covered with mud.  Instead of persisting, they go b
ack to Piccadilly.  Such persons have only themselves to thank if the very stre
et-boys mock at them.
   Another recommendation was this: buy whatever may be necessary without haggl
ing!
   You must not try to strike a proportion between the values of incommensurabl
e things.>  The least of the Magical Instruments is worth infinitely more than
all that you possess, or if you like, than all that you stupidly suppose yourse
lf to possess.  Break this rule, and the usual Nemesis of the half-hearted awai
ts you.  Not only do you get inferior instruments, but you lose in some other w
ay what you thought you were so clever to have saved.  Remember Ananias!>
   On the other hand, if you purchase without haggling you will find that along
 with your purchase the vendor has thrown in {64} the purse of Fortunatus.  No
matter in what extremity you may seem to be, at the last moment your difficulti
es will be solved.  For there is no power either of the firmament of the ether,
 or of the earth or under the earth, on dry land or in the water, of whirling a
ir or of rushing fire, or any spell or scourge of God which is not obedient to
the necessity of the Magician!  That which he has, he has not; but that which h
e is, he is; and that which he will be, he will be.  And neither God nor Man, n
or all the malice of Choronzon, can either check him, or cause him to waver for
 one instant upon the Path.  This command and this promise have been given by a
ll the Magi without exception.  And where this command has been obeyed, this pr
omise has been most certainly fulfilled.

                              III

   In all actions the same formulae are applicable.  To invoke a god, i.e. to r
aise yourself to that godhead, the process is threefold, PURIFICATION, CONSECRA
TION and INITIATION.
   Therefore every magical weapon, and even the furniture of the Temple, must b
e passed through this threefold regimen.  The details only vary on inessential
points.  E.G. to prepare the magician, he purifies himself by maintaining his c
hastity> and abstaining from any defilement.  But to do the same with, let us s
ay, the Cup, we assure ourselves that the metal has never been employed for any
 other purpose --- we smelt virgin ore, and we take all possible pains in refin
ing the metal --- it must be chemically pure.
 To sum up this whole matter in a phrase, every article employed is treated as
if it were a candidate for initiation; but in those parts of the ritual in whic
h the candidate is blindfolded, we wrap the weapon in a black cloth>.  The oath
 which he takes is replaced by a "charge" in similar terms.  The details of the
 preparation of each weapon should be thought out carefully by the magician.  {
65}
   Further, the attitude of the magician to his weapons should be that of the G
od to the suppliant who invokes Him.  It should be the love of the father for h
is child, the tenderness and care of the bridegroom for his bride, and that pec
uliar feeling which the creator of every work of art feels for his masterpiece.
 Where this is clearly understood, the magician will find no difficulty in obse
rving the proper ritual, not only in the actual ceremonial consecration of each
 weapon, but in the actual preparation, a process which should adumbrate this c
eremony; e.g., the magician will cut the wand from the tree, will strip it of l
eaves and twigs, will remove the bark.  He will trim the ends nearly, and smoot
h down the knots: --- this is the banishing.
   He will then rub it with the consecrated oil until it becomes smooth and gli
stening and golden.  He will then wrap it in silk of the appropriate colour: --
- this is the Consecration.
   He will then take it, and imagine that it is that hollow tube in which Prome
theus brought down fire from heaven, formulating to himself the passing of the
Holy Influence through it.  In this and other ways he will perform the initiati
on; and, this being accomplished, he will repeat the whole process in an elabor
ate ceremony.>
   To take an entirely different case, that of the Circle; the magician will sy
nthesize the Vermilion required from Mercury an Sulphur which he has himself su
blimated.  This pure {66} vermilion he will himself mix with the consecrated oi
l, and as he uses this paint he will think intently and with devotion of the sy
mbols which he draws.  This circle may then be initiated by a circumambulation,
 during which the magician invokes the names of God that are on it.
   Any person without sufficient ingenuity to devise proper methods of preparat
ion for the other articles required is unlikely to make much of a magician; and
 we shall only waste space if we deal in detail with the preparation of each in
strument.
   There is a definite instruction in Liber A vel Armorum, in the Equinox, Volu
me I, Number IV, as to the Lamp and the Four Elemental Weapons.

                      OF SILENCE AND SECRECY:

                              AND OF

                 THE BARBAROUS NAMES OF EVOCATION.


   It is found by experience (confirming the statement of Zoroaster) that the m
ost potent conjurations are those in an ancient and perhaps forgotten language,
 or even those couched in a corrupt and possibly always meaningless jargon.  Of
 these there are several main types.  The "preliminary invocation" in the "Goet
ia" consists principally of corruptions of Greek and Egyptian names.  For examp
le, we find "Osorronnophris" for "Asor Un-Nefer".>  The conjurations given by D
r. Dee (vide Equinox I, VIII) are in a language called Angelic, or Enochian.  I
ts source has hitherto baffled research, but it is a language and not a jargon,
 for it possesses a structure of its own, and there are traces of grammar and s
yntax.
   However this may be, it "works".  Even the beginner finds that "things happe
n" when he uses it: and this is an advantage --- or disadvantage! ---- shared b
y no other type of language,.  The rest need skill.  This needs Prudence!
   The Egyptian Invocations are much purer, but their meaning has not been suff
iciently studied by persons magically competent.  We possess a number of Invoca
tions in Greek of every degree of excellence; in Latin but few, and those of in
ferior quality.  It will be noticed that in every case the conjurations are ver
y sonorous, {68} and there is a certain magical voice in which they should be r
ecited.  This special voice was a natural gift of the Master Therion; but it ca
n be easily taught --- to the right people.
   Various considerations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the English l
anguage.  There already existed one example, the charm of the witches in Macbet
h; although this was perhaps not meant seriously, its effect is indubitable.>
 He has found iambic tetrameters enriched with many rimes both internal an exte
rnal very useful.  "The Wizard Way" (Equinox I,I) gives a good idea of the sort
 of thing.  So does the Evocation of Bartzabel in Equinox I,IX.  There are many
 extant invocations throughout his works, in many kinds of metre, of many kinds
 of being, and for many kinds of purposes.  (See Appendix).
   Other methods of incantation are on record as efficacious.  For instance Fra
ter I.A., when a child, was told that he could invoke the devil by repeating th
e "Lord's Prayer" backwards.  He went into the garden and did so.  The Devil ap
peared, and almost scared him out of his life.
 It is therefore not quite certain in what the efficacy of conjurations really
lies.  The peculiar mental excitement required may even be aroused by the perce
ption of the absurdity of the process, and the persistence in it, as when once
FRATER PERDURABO (at the end of His magical resources) recited "From Greenland'
s Icy Mountains", and obtained His result.>
   It may be conceded in any case that the long strings of formidable words whi
ch roar and moan through so many conjurations have a real effect in exalting th
e consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch --- that they should do so
is no more extraordinary than music of any kind should do so.
 Magicians have not confined themselves to the use of the human voice.  The Pan
-pipe with its seven stops, corresponding to the seven planets, the bull-roarer
, the tom-tom, and even the violin, have all been used, as well as many others,
 of which the {69} most important is the bell>, though this is used not so much
 for actual conjuration as to mark stages in the ceremony.  Of all these the to
m-tom will be found to be the most generally useful.
   While on the subject of barbarous names of evocation we should not omit the
utterance of certain supreme words which enshrine (alpha) the complete formula
of the God invoked, or (beta) the whole ceremony.
   Examples of the former kind are Tetragrammaton, I.A.O., and Abrahadabra.
   An example of the latter kind is the great word StiBeTTChePhMeFSHiSS, which
is a line drawn on the Tree of Life (Coptic attributions) in a certain manner.>
   With all such words it is of the utmost importance that they should never be
 spoken until the supreme moment, and even then they should burst from the magi
cian almost despite himself --- so great should be his reluctance> to utter the
m.  In fact, they should be the utterance of the God in him at the first onset
of the divine possession.  So uttered, they cannot fail of effect, for they hav
e become the effect.
   Every wise magician will have constructed (according to the principles of th
e Holy Qabalah) many such words, and he should have quintessentialised them all
 in one Word, which last Word, once he has formed it, he should never utter con
sciously even in thought, until perhaps with it he gives up the ghost.  Such a
Word should in fact be so potent that man cannot hear it and live. {70}
   Such a word was indeed the lost Tetragrammaton>.  It is said that at the utt
erance of this name the Universe crashes into dissolution.  Let the Magician ea
rnestly seek this Lost Word, for its pronunciation is synonymous with the accom
plishment of the Great Work.>
 In this matter of the efficacity of words there are again two formulae exactly
 opposite in nature.  A word may become potent and terrible by virtue of consta
nt repetition.  It is in this way that most religions gain strength.  At first
the statement "So and so is God" excites no interest.  Continue, and you meet s
corn and scepticism: possibly persecution.  Continue, and the controversy has s
o far died out that no one troubles to contradict your assertion.
   No superstition is so dangerous and so lively as an exploded superstition.
The newspapers of to-day (written and edited almost exclusively by men without
a spark of either religion or morality) dare not hint that any one disbelieves
in the ostensibly prevailing cult; they deplore Atheism --- all but universal i
n practice and implicit in the theory of practically all intelligent people ---
 as if it were the eccentricity of a few negligible or objectionable persons.
This is the ordinary story of advertisement; the sham has exactly the same chan
ce as the real.  Persistence is the only quality required for success.
   The opposite formula is that of secrecy.  An idea is perpetuated because it
must never be mentioned.  A freemason never forgets the secret words entrusted
to him, thought these words mean absolutely nothing to him, in the vast majorit
y of cases; the only reason for this is that he has been forbidden to mention t
hem, although they have been published again and again, and are as accessible t
o the profane as to the initiate.
   In such a work of practical Magick as the preaching of a new {71} Law, these
 methods may be advantageously combined; on the one hand infinite frankness and
 readiness to communicate all secrets; on the other the sublime and terrible kn
owledge that all real secrets are incommunicable.>
   It is, according to tradition, a certain advantage in conjurations to employ
 more than one language.  In all probability the reason of this is than any cha
nge spurs the flagging attention.  A man engaged in intense mental labour will
frequently stop and walk up and down the room --- one may suppose for this caus
e --- but it is a sign of weakness that this should be necessary.  For the begi
nner in Magick, however, it is permissible> to employ any device to secure the
result.
   Conjurations should be recited, not read:> and the entire ceremony should be
 so perfectly performed that one is hardly conscious of any effort of memory.
The ceremony should be constructed with such logical fatality that a mistake is
 impossible.>  The conscious ego of the Magician is to be destroyed to be absor
bed in that of the God whom he invokes, and the process should not interfere wi
th the automation who is performing the ceremony.
   But this ego of which it is here spoken is the true ultimate ego.  The autom
aton should possess will, energy, intelligence, reason, and resource.  This aut
omaton should be the perfect man far more {72} than any other man can be.  It i
s only the divine self within the man, a self as far above the possession of wi
ll or any other qualities whatsoever as the heavens are high above the earth, t
hat should reabsorb itself into that illimitable radiance of which it is a spar
k.>

   The great difficulty for the single Magician is so to perfect himself that t
hese multifarious duties of the Ritual are adequately performed.  At first he w
ill find that the exaltation destroys memory and paralyses muscle.  This is an
essential difficulty of the magical process, and can only be overcome by practi
ce and experience.>
   In order to aid concentration, and to increase the supply of Energy, it has
been customary for the Magician to employ assistants or colleagues.  It is doub
tful whether the obvious advantages of this plan compensate the difficulty of p
rocuring suitable persons>, and the chance of a conflict of will or a misunders
tanding in the circle itself.  On one occasion FRATER PERDURABO was disobeyed b
y an assistant, and had it not been for His promptitude in using the physical c
ompulsion of the sword, it is probable that the circle would have been broken.
 As it was, the affair fortunately terminated in nothing more serious than the
destruction of the culprit.
   However, there is no doubt that an assemblage of persons who really are in h
armony can much more easily produce an effect than a magician working by himsel
f.  The psychology of "Revival meetings" will be familiar to almost every one,
and though such {73} meetings> are the foulest and most degraded rituals of bla
ck magic, the laws of Magick are not thereby suspended.  The laws of Magick are
 the laws of Nature.
   A singular and world-famous example of this is of sufficiently recent date t
o be fresh in the memory of many people now living.  At a nigger camp meeting i
n the "United" States of America, devotees were worked up to such a pitch of ex
citement that the whole assembly developed a furious form of hysteria.  The com
paratively intelligible cries of "Glory" and "Hallelujah" no longer expressed t
he situation.  Somebody screamed out "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!", and this was taken
 up by the whole meeting and yelled continuously, until reaction set in.  The a
ffair got into the papers, and some particularly bright disciple of John Stuart
 Mill, logician and economist, thought that these words, having set one set of
fools crazy, might do the same to all the other fools in the world.  He accordi
ngly wrote a song, and produced the desired result.  This is the most notorious
 example of recent times of the power exerted by a barbarous name of evocation.
   A few words may be useful to reconcile the general notion of Causality with
that of Magick.  How can we be sure that a person waving a stick and howling th
ereby produces thunderstorms?  In no other way than that familiar to Science; w
e note that whenever we put a lighted match to dry gunpowder, an unintelligibly
 arbitrary phenomenon, that of sound, is observed; and so forth.
   We need not dwell upon this point; but it seems worth while to answer one of
 the objections to the possibility of Magick, chosing one which is at first sig
ht of an obviously "fatal" character.  It is convenient to quote verbatim from
the Diary> of a distinguished Magician and philosopher.
   "I have noticed that the effect of a Magical Work has followed {74} it so cl
osely that it must have been started before the time of the Work.  E.g. I work
to-night to make X in Paris write to me.  I get the letter the next morning, so
 that it must have been written before the Work.  Does this deny that the Work
caused the effect?
   "If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, both my will and its motion are d
ue to causes long antecedent to the act.  I may consider both my Work and its r
eaction as twin effects of the eternal Universe.  The moved arm and ball are pa
rts of a state of the Cosmos which resulted necessarily from its momentarily pr
evious state, and so, back for ever.
   "Thus, my Magical Work is only one of the cause-effects necessarily concomit
ant with the case-effects which set the ball in motion.  I may therefore regard
 the act of striking as a cause-effect of my original Will to move the ball, th
ough necessarily previous to its motion.  But the case of magical Work is not q
uite analogous.  For my nature is such that I am compelled to perform Magick in
 order to make my will to prevail; so that the cause of my doing the Work is al
so the cause of the ball's motion, and there is no reason why one should preced
e the other.  (CF. "Lewis Carroll," where the Red Queen screams before she pric
ks her finger.)
   "Let me illustrate the theory by an actual example.
   "I write from Italy to a man in France and another in Australia on the same
day, telling them to join me.  Both arrive ten days later; the first in answer
to my letter, which he received, the second on "his own initiative", as it woul
d seem.  But I summoned him because I wanted him; and I wanted him because he w
as my representative; and his intelligence made him resolve to join me because
it judged rightly that the situation (so far as he knew it) was such as to make
 me desire his presence.
   "The same cause, therefore, which made me write to him made him come to me;
and though it would be improper to say that the writing of the letter was the d
irect cause of his arrival, it is evident that if I had not written I should ha
ve been different from what I actually am, and therefore my relations with him
would have been otherwise than they are.  In this sense, therefore, the letter
and the journey are causally connected.
   "One cannot go farther, and say that in this case I ought to write the lette
r even if he had arrived before I did so; for it {75} is part of the whole set
of circumstance that I do not use a crowbar on an open door.
   "The conclusion is that one should do one's Will 'without lust of result'.
If one is working in accordance with the laws of one's own nature, one is doing
 'right'; and no such work can be criticised as 'useless', even in cases of the
 character here discussed.  So long as one's Will prevails, there is no cause f
or complaint.
   "To abandon one's Magick would shew lack of self-confidence in one's powers,
 and doubt as to one's inmost faith in Self and in Nature.>  Of course one chan
ges one's methods as experience indicates; but there is no need to change them
on any such ground as the above.
   "Further, the argument here set forth disposes of the need to explain the "m
odus operandi" of Magick.  A successful operation does not involve any theory s
oever, not even that of the existence of causality itself.  The whole set of ph
enomena may be conceived as single.
   "For instance, if I see a star (as it was years ago) I need not assume causa
l relations as existing between it, the earth, and myself.  The connexion exist
s; I can predicate nothing beyond that.  I cannot postulate purpose, or even de
termine the manner in which the event comes to be.  Similarly, when I do Magick
, it is in vain to inquire why I so act, or why the desired result does or does
 not follow.  Nor can I know how the previous and subsequent conditions are con
nected.  At most I can describe the consciousness which I interpret as a pictur
e of the facts, and make empirical generalizations of the superficial aspects o
f the case.
 "Thus, I have my own personal impressions of the act of telephoning; but I can
not be aware of what consciousness, electricity, mechanics, sound, etc., actual
ly are in themselves.  And although I can appeal to experience to lay down 'law
s' as to what {76} conditions accompany the act, I can never be sure that they
have always been, or ever will again be, identical.  (In fact, it is certain th
at an event can never occur twice in precisely the same circumstances.)>
 "Further, my 'laws; must always take nearly all the more important elements of
 knowledge for granted.  I cannot say --- finally --- how an electric current i
s generated.  I cannot be sure that some totally unsuspected force is not at wo
rk in some entirely arbitrary way.  For example, it was formerly supposed that
Hydrogen and Chlorine would unite when an electric spark was passed through the
 mixture; now we 'know' that the presence of a minute quantity of aqueous vapou
r (or some tertium quid) is essential to the reaction.  We formulated before th
e days of Ross the 'laws' of malarial fever, without reference to the mosquito;
 we might discover one day that the germ is only active when certain events are
 transpiring in some nebula>, or when so apparently inert a substance as Argon
is present in the air in certain proportions.
   "We may therefore admit quite cheerfully that Magick is as mysterious as mat
hematics, as empirical as poetry, as uncertain as golf, and as dependent on the
 personal equation as Love.
   "That is no reason why we should not study, practice and enjoy it; for it is
 a Science in exactly the same sense as biology; it is no less an Art that Scul
pture; and it is a Sport as much as Mountaineering.
   "Indeed, there seems to be no undue presumption in urging that no Science po
ssesses equal possibilities of deep and important Knowledge;>that no Art offers
 such opportunities to the ambition {77} of the Soul to express its Truth, in E
cstasy, through Beauty; and that no Sport rivals its fascinations of danger and
 delight, so excites, exercises, and tests its devotees to the uttermost, or so
 rewards them by well-being, pride, and the passionate pleasures of personal tr
iumph.
   "Magick takes every thought and act for its apparatus; it has the Universe f
or its Library and its Laboratory; all Nature is its Subject; and its Game, fre
e from close seasons and protective restrictions, always abounds in infinite va
riety, being all that exists.>

                              CHAPTER X

                           OF THE GESTURES



   This chapter may be divided into the following parts:

1. Attitudes.
2. Circumambulations (and similar movements).
3. Changes of position (This depends upon the theory of the construction of the
 circle).
4. The Knocks or Knells.

                                 I

   Attitudes are of two Kinds: natural and artificial.  Of the first kind, pros
tration is the obvious example.  It comes natural to man (poor creature!) to th
row himself to the ground in the presence of the object of his adoration.>
   Intermediate between this and the purely artificial form of gesture comes a
class which depends on acquired habit.  Thus it is natural to an European offic
er to offer his sword in token of surrender.  A Tibetan would, however, squat,
put out his tongue, and place his hand behind his right ear.
   Purely artificial gestures comprehend in their class the majority of definit
ely magick signs, though some of these simulate a natural action --- e.g. the s
ign of the Rending of the Veil.  But the sign of Auramoth (see Equinox I, II, I
llustration "The Signs of the Grades") merely imitates a hieroglyph which has o
nly a remote connection with any fact in nature.  All signs must of course be s
tudied with infinite patience, and practised until the connection {79} between
them and the mental attitude which they represent appears "necessary."

                               II
   The principal movement in the circle is circumambulation.>  This has a very
definite result, but one which is very difficult to describe.  An analogy is th
e dynamo.  Circumambulation properly performed in combination with the Sign of
Horus (or "The Enterer") on passing the East is one of the best methods of arou
sing the macrocosmic force in the Circle.  It should never be omitted unless th
ere be some special reason against it.
   A particular tread seems appropriate to it.  This tread should be light and
stealthy, almost furtive, and yet very purposeful.  It is the pace of the tiger
 who stalks the deer.
   The number of circumambulations should of course correspond to the nature of
 the ceremony.
   Another important movement is the spiral, of which there are two principal f
orms, one inward, one outward.  They can be performed in either direction; and,
 like the circumambulation, if performed deosil> they invoke --- if widdershins
> they banish>.  In the spiral the tread is light and tripping, almost approxim
ating to a dance: while performing it the magician will usually turn on his own
 axis, either in the same direction as {80} the spiral, or in the opposite dire
ction.  Each combination involves a different symbolism.
   There is also the dance proper; it has many different forms, each God having
 his special dance.  One of the easiest and most effective dances is the ordina
ry waltz-step combined with the three signs of L.V.X.  It is much easier to att
ain ecstasy in this way than is generally supposed.  The essence of the process
 consists in the struggle of the Will against giddiness; but this struggle must
 be prolonged and severe, and upon the degree of this the quality and intensity
 of ecstasy attained may depend.
   With practice, giddiness is altogether conquered; exhaustion then takes its
place and the enemy of Will.  It is through the mutual destruction of these ant
agonisms in the mental and moral being of the magician that Samadhi is begotten
.

                              III
 Good examples of the use of change of position are given in the manuscripts Z.
1 and Z.3;> explanatory of the Neophyte Ritual of the G.'. D.'., where the cand
idate is taken to various stations in the Temple, each station having a symboli
c meaning of its own; but in pure invocation a better example is given in Liber
 831>.
   In the construction of a ceremony an important thing to decide is whether yo
u will or will not make such movements.  For every Circle has its natural symbo
lism, and even if no use is to be made of these facts, one must be careful not
to let anything be inharmonious with the natural attributions.>  For the sensit
ive aura of the magician might be disturbed, and the value of the ceremony comp
letely destroyed, by the embarrassment caused by the discovery of some such err
or, just as if a pre-occupied T-totaller found that he had strayed into a Templ
e of the Demon Rum!  It is therefore impossible to neglect the theory of the Ci
rcle.  {81}
   To take a simple example, suppose that, in an Evocation of Bartzabel, the pl
anet Mars, whose sphere is Geburah (Severity) were situated (actually, in the h
eavens) opposite to the Square of Chesed (Mercy) of the Tau in the Circle, and
the triangle placed accordingly.  It would be improper for the Magus to stand o
n that Square unless using this formula, "I, from Chesed, rule Geburah through
the Path of the Lion"; while --- taking an extreme case --- to stand on the squ
are of Hod (which is naturally dominated by Geburah) would be a madness which o
nly a formula of the very highest Magick could counteract.
   Certain positions, however, such as Tiphareth>, are so sympathetic to the Ma
gus himself that he may use them without reference to the nature of the spirit,
 or of the operation; unless he requires an exceptionally precise spirit free o
f all extraneous elements, or one whose nature is difficulty compatible with Ti
phareth.
   To show how these positions may be used in conjunction with the spirals, sup
pose that you are invoking Hathor, Goddess of Love, to descend upon the Altar.
 Standing on the square of Netzach you will make your invocation to Her, and th
en dance an inward spiral deosil ending at the foot of the altar, where you sin
k on your knees with your arms raised above the altar as if inviting Her embrac
e.>
 To conclude, one may add that natural artistic ability, of you possess it, for
ms an excellent guide.  All Art is Magick.
   Isadora Duncan has this gift of gesture in a very high degree.  Let the read
er study her dancing; if possible rather in private than in public, and learn t
he superb "unconsciousness" --- which is magical consciousness --- with which s
he suits the action to the melody.>
   There is no more potent means than Art of calling forth true Gods to visible
 appearance.  {82}


                              IV.
   The knocks or knells are all of the same character.  They may be described c
ollectively --- the difference between them consists only in this, that the ins
trument with which they are made seals them with its own special properties.  I
t is of no great importance (even so) whether they are made by clapping the han
ds or stamping the feet, by strokes of one of the weapons, or by the theoretica
lly appropriate instrument, the bell.  It may nevertheless be admitted that the
y become more important in the ceremony if the Magician considers it worth whil
e to take up> an instrument whose single purpose is to produce them.
 Let it first be laid down that a knock asserts a connection between the Magici
an and the object which he strikes.  Thus the use of the bell, or of the hands,
 means that the Magician wishes to impress the atmosphere of the whole circle w
ith what has been or is about to be done.  He wishes to formulate his will in s
ound, and radiate it in every direction; moreover, to influence that which live
s by breath in the sense of his purpose, and to summon it to bear witness to hi
s Word.  The hands are used as symbols of his executive power, the bell to repr
esent his consciousness exalted into music.  To strike with the wand is to utte
r the fiat of creation; the cup vibrates with his delight in receiving spiritua
l wine.  A blow with the dagger is like the signal for battle.  The disk is use
d to express the throwing down of the price of one's purchase.  To stamp with t
he foot is to declare one's mastery of the matter in hand.  Similarly, any othe
r form of giving knocks has its own virtue.  From the above examples the intell
igent student will have perceived the method of interpreting each individual ca
se that may come in question.
   As above said, the object struck is the object impressed.  Thus, a blow upon
 the altar affirms that he has complied with the laws of his operation.  To str
ike the lamp is to summon the Light divine.  Thus for the rest.
   It must also be observed that many combinations of ideas are made possible b
y this convention.  To strike the wand within the cup is to apply the creative
will to its proper complement, and so {83} perform the Great Work by the formul
a of Regeneration.  To strike with the hand on the dagger declares that one dem
ands the use of the dagger as a tool to extend one's executive power.  The read
er will recall how Siegfried smote Nothung, the sword of Need, upon the lance o
f Wotan.  By the action Wagner, who was instructed how to apply magical formula
e by one of the heads of our Order, intended his hearers to understand that the
 reign of authority and paternal power had come to an end; that the new master
of the world was intellect.
   The general object of a knock or a knell is to mark a stage in the ceremony.
  Sasaki Shigetz tells us in his essay on Shinto that the Japanese are accustom
ed to clap their hands four times "to drive away evil spirits".  He explains th
at what really happens is that the sudden and sharp impact of the sound throws
the mind into an alert activity which enables it to break loose from the obsess
ion of its previous mood.  It is aroused to apply itself aggressively to the id
eals which had oppressed it.  There is therefore a perfectly rational interpret
ation of the psychological power of the knock.
   In a Magical ceremony the knock is employed for much the same purpose.  The
Magician uses it like the chorus in a Greek play.  It helps him to make a clean
 cut, to turn his attention from one part of his work to the next.
   So much for the general character of the knock or knell.  Even this limited
point of view offers great opportunities to the resourceful Magician.  But furt
her possibilities lie to our hand.  It is not usually desirable to attempt to c
onvey anything except emphasis, and possibly mood, by varying the force of the
blow.  It is obvious, moreover, that there is a natural correspondence between
the hard loud knock of imperious command on the one hand, and the soft slurred
knock of sympathetic comprehension on the other.  It is easy to distinguish bet
ween the bang of the outraged creditor at the front, and the hushed tap of the
lover at the bedroom, door.  Magical theory cannot here add instruction to inst
inct.
   But a knock need not be single; the possible combinations are evidently infi
nite.  We need only discuss the general principles of determining what number o
f strokes will be proper in any case, {84} and how we may interrupt any series
so as to express our idea by means of structure.
   The general rule is that a single knock has no special significance as such,
 because unity is omniform.  It represents Kether, which is the source of all t
hings equally without partaking of any quality by which we discriminate one thi
ng from another.  Continuing on these lines, the number of knocks will refer to
 the Sephira or other idea Qabalistically cognate with that number.  Thus, 7 kn
ocks will intimate Venus, 11 the Great Work, 17 the Trinity of Fathers, and 19
the Feminine Principle in its most general sense.
   Analyzing the matter a little further, we remark firstly that a battery of t
oo many knocks is confusing, as well as liable to overweight the other parts of
 the ritual.  In practice, 11 is about the limit.  It is usually not difficult
to arrange to cover all necessary ground with that number.
   Secondly, each is so extensive in scope, and includes aspects so diverse fro
m a practical standpoint that our danger lies in vagueness.  A knock should be
well defined; its meaning should be precise.  The very nature of knocks suggest
s smartness and accuracy.  We must therefore devise some means of making the se
quence significant of the special sense which may be appropriate.  Our only res
ource is in the use of intervals.
   It is evidently impossible to attain great variety in the smaller numbers.
But this fact illustrates the excellence of our system.  There is only one way
of striking 2 knocks, and this fact agrees with the nature of Chokmah; there is
 only one way of creating.  We can express only ourselves, although we do so in
 duplex form.  But there are three ways of striking 3 knocks, and these 3 ways
correspond to the threefold manner in which Binah can receive the creative idea
.  There are three possible types of triangle.  We may understand an idea eithe
r as an unity tripartite, as an unity dividing itself into a duality, or as a d
uality harmonized into an unity.  Any of these methods may be indicated by 3 eq
ual knocks; 1 followed, after a pause, by 2; and 2 followed, after a pause, by
1.
   As the nature of the number becomes more complex, the possible varieties inc
rease rapidly.  There are numerous ways of striking 6, each of which is suited
to the nature of the several {85} aspects of Tiphareth.  We may leave the deter
mination of these points to the ingenuity of the student.
   The most generally useful and adaptable battery is composed of 11 strokes.
The principal reasons for this are as follows: "Firstly", 11 is the number of M
agick in itself.  It is therefore suitable to all types of operation.  "Secondl
y", it is the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon.  As it is written i
n the Book of the Law: "...11, as all their numbers who are of us."  "Thirdly",
 it is the number of the letters of the word ABRAHADABRA, which is the word of
the Aeon.  The structure of this word is such that it expresses the great Work,
 in every one of its aspects.  "Lastly", it is possible thereby to express all
possible spheres of operation, whatever their nature.  This is effected by maki
ng an equation between the number of the Sephira and the difference between tha
t number and 11.  For example, 2 Degree=9Square is the formula of the grade of
initiation corresponding to Yesod.  Yesod represents the instability of air, th
e sterility of the moon; but these qualities are balanced in it by the stabilit
y implied in its position as the Foundation, and by its function of generation.
  This complex is further equilibrated by identifying it with the number 2 of C
hokmah, which possesses the airy quality, being the Word, and the lunar quality
, being the reflection of the sun of Kether as Yesod is the sun of Tiphareth.
It is the wisdom which is the foundation by being creation.  This entire cycle
of ideas is expressed in the double formula 2 Degree = 9Square, 9 Degree = 2Squ
are; and any of these ideas may be selected and articulated by a suitable batte
ry.
   We may conclude with a single illustration of how the above principles may b
e put into practice.  Let us suppose that the Magician contemplates an operatio
n for the purpose of helping his mind to resist the tendency to wander.  This w
ill be a work of Yesod.  But he must emphasize the stability of that Sephira as
 against the Airy quality which it possesses.  His first action will be to put
the 9 under the protection of the 2; the battery at this point will be 1-9-1.
But this 9 as it stands is suggestive of the changefulness of the moon.  It may
 occur to him to divide this into 4 and 5, 4 being the number of fixity, law, a
nd authoritative power; and 5 that of courage, energy, and triumph of the spiri
t {86} over the elements.  He will reflect, moreover, that 4 is symbolic of the
 stability of matter, while 5 expresses the same idea with regard to motion.  A
t this stage the battery will appear as 1-2-5-2-1.  After due consideration he
will probably conclude that to split up the central 5 would tend to destroy the
 simplicity of his formula, and decide to use it as it stands.  The possible al
ternative would be to make a single knock the centre of his battery as if he ap
pealed to the ultimate immutability of Kether, invoking that unity by placing a
 fourfold knock on either side of it.  In this case, his battery would be 1-4-1
-4-1.  He will naturally have been careful to preserve the balance of each part
 of the battery against the corresponding part.  This would be particularly nec
essary in an operation such as we have chosen for our example.

   The essential magical work, apart from any particular operation, is the prop
er formation of the Magical Being or Body of Light.  This process will be discu
ssed at some length in Chapter XVIII.
   We will here assume that the magician has succeeded in developing his Body o
f Light until it is able to go anywhere and do anything.  There will, however,
be a certain limitation to his work, because he has formed his magical body fro
m the fine matter of his own element.  Therefore, although he may be able to pe
netrate the utmost recesses of the heavens, or conduct vigorous combats with th
e most unpronounceable demons of the pit, it may be impossible for him to do as
 much as knock a vase from a mantelpiece.  His magical body is composed of matt
er too tenuous to affect directly the gross matter of which illusions such as t
ables and chairs are made.> {89}
   There has been a good deal of discussion in the past within the Colleges of
the Holy Ghost, as to whether it would be quite legitimate to seek to transcend
 this limitation.  One need not presume to pass judgment.  One can leave the de
cision to the will of each magician.
   The Book of the Dead contains many chapters intended to enable the magical e
ntity of a man who is dead, and so deprived (according to the theory of death t
hen current) of the material vehicle for executing his will, to take on the for
m of certain animals, such as a golden hawk or a crocodile, and in such form to
 go about the earth "taking his pleasure among the living.">  As a general rule
, material was supplied out of which he could construct the party of the second
 part aforesaid, hereinafter referred to as the hawk.
   We need not, however, consider this question of death.  It may often be conv
enient for the living to go about the world in some such incognito.  Now, then,
 conceive of this magical body as creative force, seeking manifestation; as a G
od, seeking incarnation.
 There are two ways by which this aim may be effected.  The first method is to
build up an appropriate body from its elements.  This is, generally speaking, a
 very hard thing to do, because the physical constitution of any material being
 with much power is, or at least should be, the outcome of ages of evolution.
However, there is a lawful method of producing an homunculus which is taught in
 a certain secret organization, perhaps known to some of those who may read thi
s, which could very readily be adapted to some such purpose as we are now discu
ssing.
   The second method sounds very easy and amusing.  You take some organism alre
ady existing, which happens to be suitable to your purpose.  You drive out the
magical being {89} which inhabits it, and take possession.  To do this by force
 is neither easy nor justifiable, because the magical being of the other was in
carnated in accordance with its Will.  And "... thou hast no right but to do th
y will."  One should hardly strain this sentence to make one's own will include
 the will to upset somebody else's will!>  Moreover, it is extremely difficult
thus to expatriate another magical being; for though, unless it is a complete m
icrocosm like a human being, it cannot be called a star, it is a little bit of
a star, and part of the body of Nuit.
   But there is no call for all this frightfulness.  There is no need to knock
the girl down, unless she refuses to do what you want, and she will always comp
ly if you say a few nice things to her.>  You can always use the body inhabited
 by an elemental, such as an eagle, hare, wolf, or any convenient animal, by ma
king a very simple compact.  You take over the responsibility for the animal, t
hus building it up into your own magical hierarchy.  This represents a tremendo
us gain to the animal.>  It completely fulfils its ambition by an alliance of t
his extremely intimate sort with a Star.  The magician, on the other hand, is a
ble to transform and retransform himself in a thousand ways by accepting a reti
nue of such adherents.  In this way the projection of the "astral" or Body of L
ight may be made absolutely tangible and practical.  At the same time, the magi
cian must realise that in undertaking the Karma of any elemental, he is assumin
g a very serious responsibility.  The bond which unites him with that elemental
 is love; and, though it is only a small part of the outfit of a magician, it i
s the whole of the outfit of the elemental.  He will, therefore, suffer intense
ly in case of any error or misfortune occurring to his protegee.  This feeling
is rather peculiar.  It is quite instinctive with the best men.  They {90} hear
 of the destruction of a city of a few thousand inhabitants with entire callous
ness, but then they hear of a dog having hurt its paw, they feel Weltschmertz a
cutely.
   It is not necessary to say much more than this concerning transformations.
Those to whom the subject naturally appeals will readily understand the importa
nce of what has been said.  Those who are otherwise inclined may reflect that a
 nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.

                            CHAPTER XII

           OF THE BLOODY SACRIFICE: AND MATTERS COGNATE.


   It is necessary for us to consider carefully the problems connected with the
 bloody sacrifice, for this question is indeed traditionally important in Magic
k.  Nigh all ancient Magick revolves around this matter.  In particular all the
 Osirian religions --- the rites of the Dying God --- refer to this.  The slayi
ng of Osiris and Adonis; the mutilation of Attis; the cults of Mexico and Peru;
 the story of Hercules or Melcarth; the legends of Dionysus and of Mithra, are
all connected with this one idea.  In the Hebrew religion we find the same thin
g inculcated.  The first ethical lesson in the Bible is that the only sacrifice
 pleasing to the Lord is the sacrifice of blood; Abel, who made this, finding f
avour with the Lord, while Cain, who offered cabbages, was rather naturally con
sidered a cheap sport.  The idea recurs again and again.  We have the sacrifice
 of the Passover, following on the story of Abraham's being commanded to sacrif
ice his firstborn son, with the idea of the substitution of animal for human li
fe.  The annual ceremony of the two goats carries out this in perpetuity.  And
we see again the domination of this idea in the romance of Esther, where Haman
and Mordecai are the two goats or gods; and ultimately in the presentation of t
he rite of Purim in Palestine, where Jesus and Barabbas happened to be the Goat
s in that particular year of which we hear so much, without agreement on the da
te.
 This subject must be studied in the "Golden Bough", where it is most learnedly
 set forth by Dr. J. G. Frazer.
   Enough has now been said to show that the bloody sacrifice has from time imm
emorial been the most considered part of Magick.  {92} The ethics of the thing
appear to have concerned no one; nor, to tell the truth, need they do so.  As S
t. Paul says, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"; and who are we
 to argue with St. Paul?  But, after all that, it is open to any one to have an
y opinion that he likes upon the subject, or any other subject, thank God!  At
the same time, it is most necessary to study the business, whatever we may be g
oing to do about it; for our ethics themselves will naturally depend upon our t
heory of the universe.  If we were quite certain, for example, that everybody w
ent to heaven when he died, there could be no serious objection to murder or su
icide, as it is generally conceded --- by those who know neither --- that earth
 is not such a pleasant place as heaven.
   However, there is a mystery concealed in this theory of the bloody sacrifice
 which is of great importance to the student, and we therefore make no further
apology,  We should not have made even this apology for an apology, had it not
been for the solicitude of a pious young friend of great austerity of character
 who insisted that the part of this chapter which now follows --- the part whic
h was originally written --- might cause us to be misunderstood.  This must not
 be.
   The blood is the life.  This simple statement is explained by the Hindus by
saying that the blood is the principal vehicle of vital Prana.>  There is some
ground for the belief that there is a definite substance>, not isolated as yet,
 whose presence makes all {93} the difference between live and dead matter.  We
 pass by with deserved contempt the pseudo-scientific experiments of American c
harlatans who claim to have established that weight is lost at the moment of de
ath, and the unsupported statements of alleged clairvoyants that they have seen
 the soul issuing like a vapour from the mouth of persons "in articulo mortis";
 but his experiences as an explorer have convinced the Master Therion that meat
 loses a notable portion of its nutritive value within a very few minutes after
 the death of the animal, and that this loss proceeds with ever-diminishing rap
idity as time goes on.  It is further generally conceded that live food, such a
s oysters, is the most rapidly assimilable and most concentrated form of energy
.>  Laboratory experiments in food-values seem to be almost worthless, for reas
ons which we cannot here enter into; the general testimony of mankind appears a
 safer guide.
   It would be unwise to condemn as irrational the practice of those savages wh
o tear the heart and liver from an adversary, and devour them while yet warm.
In any case it was the theory of {94} the ancient Magicians, that any living be
ing is a storehouse of energy varying in quantity according to the size and hea
lth of the animal, and in quality according to its mental and moral character.
 At the death of the animal this energy is liberated suddenly.
   The animal should therefore be killed> within the Circle, or the Triangle, a
s the case may be, so that its energy cannot escape.  An animal should be selec
ted whose nature accords with that of the ceremony --- thus, by sacrificing a f
emale lamb one would not obtain any appreciate quantity of the fierce energy us
eful to a Magician who was invoking Mars.  In such a case a ram> would be more
suitable.  And this ram should be virgin --- the whole potential of its origina
l total energy should not have been diminished in any way.>  For the highest sp
iritual working one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the grea
test and purest force.  A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence
> is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.  {95}
 For evocations it would be more convenient to place the blood of the victim in
 the Triangle --- the idea being that the spirit might obtain from the blood th
is subtle but physical substance which was the quintessence of its life in such
 a manner as to enable it to take on a visible and tangible shape.>
   Those magicians who abject to the use of blood have endeavored to replace it
 with incense.  For such a purpose the incense of Abramelin may be burnt in lar
ge quantities.  Dittany of Crete is also a valuable medium.  Both these incense
s are very catholic in their nature, and suitable for almost any materializatio
n.
   But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious; and fo
r nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best.  The truly great Magician wi
ll be able to use his own blood, or possibly that of a disciple, and that witho
ut sacrificing the physical life irrevocably.>  An example of this sacrifice is
 given in Chapter 44 of Liber 333.  This Mass may be recommended generally for
daily practice.
   One last word on this subject.  There is a Magical operation of maximum impo
rtance: the Initiation of a New Aeon.  When it becomes necessary to utter a Wor
d, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood.  Before man is ready to accept the
 Law of Thelema, the Great War must be fought.  This Bloody Sacrifice is the cr
itical point of the World-{96}Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowne
d and conquering Child, as Lord of the Aeon.>
   This whole matter is prophesied in the Book of the Law itself; let the stude
nt take note, and enter the ranks of the Host of the Sun.

                              II
   There is another sacrifice with regard to which the Adepts have always maint
ained the most profound secrecy.  It is the supreme mystery of practical Magick
.  Its name is the Formula of the Rosy Cross.  In this case the victim is alway
s --- in a certain sense --- the Magician himself, and the sacrifice must coinc
ide with the utterance of the most sublime and secret name of the God whom he w
ishes to invoke.
   Properly performed, it never fails of its effect.  But it is difficult for t
he beginner to do it satisfactorily, because it is a great effort for the mind
to remain concentrated upon the purpose of the ceremony.  The overcoming of thi
s difficulty lends most powerful aid to the Magician.
   It is unwise for him to attempt it until he has received regular initiation
in the true> Order of the Rosy Cross, {97} and he must have taken the vows with
 the fullest comprehension and experience of their meaning.  It is also extreme
ly desirable that he should have attained an absolute degree of moral emancipat
ion>, and that purity of spirit which results from a perfect understanding both
 of the differences and harmonies of the planes upon the Tree of Life.
   For this reason FRATER PERDURABO has never dared to use this formula in a fu
lly ceremonial manner, save once only, on an occasion of tremendous import, whe
n, indeed, it was not He that made the offering, but ONE in Him.  For he percei
ved a grave defect in his moral character which he has been able to overcome on
 the intellectual plane, but not hitherto upon higher planes.  Before the concl
usion of writing this book he will have done so.>
   The practical details of the Bloody Sacrifice may be studied in various ethn
ological manuals, but the general conclusions are summed up in Frazer's "Golden
 Bough", which is strongly recommended to the reader.
   Actual ceremonial details likewise may be left to experiment.  The method of
 killing is practically uniform.  The animal should be stabbed to the heart, or
 its throat severed, in either case by the knife.  All other methods of killing
 are less efficacious; even in the case of Crucifixion death is given by stabbi
ng.>
   One may remark that warm-blooded animals only are used as victims: with two
principal exceptions.  The first is the serpent, which is only used in a very s
pecial Ritual;> the second the magical beetles of Liber Legis. (See Part IV.)
{98}
   One word of warning is perhaps necessary for the beginner.  The victim must
be in perfect health --- or its energy may be as it were poisoned.  It must als
o not be too large:> the amount of energy disengaged is almost unimaginably gre
at, and out of all anticipated proportion to the strength of the animal.  Conse
quently, the Magician may easily be overwhelmed and obsessed by the force which
 he has let loose; it will then probably manifest itself in its lowest and most
 objectionable form.  The most intense spirituality of purpose> is absolutely e
ssential to safety.
   In evocations the danger is not so great, as the Circle forms a protection;
but the circle in such a case must be protected, not only by the names of God a
nd the Invocations used at the same time, but by a long habit of successful def
ence.>  If you are easily disturbed or alarmed, or if you have not yet overcome
 the tendency of the mind to wander, it is not advisable for you to perform {99
} the "Bloody Sacrifice".>  Yet it should not be forgotten that this, and that
other art at which we have dared darkly to hint, are the supreme formulae of Pr
actical Magick.
   You are also likely to get into trouble over this chapter unless you truly c
omprehend its meaning.>

                           CHAPTER XIII

                        OF THE BANISHINGS:

                     AND OF THE PURIFICATIONS.


 Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and had better come first.  Purity means sin
gleness.  God is one.  The wand is not a wand if it has something sticking to i
t which is not an essential part of itself.  If you wish to invoke Venus, you d
o not succeed if there are traces of Saturn mixed up with it.
   That is a mere logical commonplace: in magick one must go much farther than
this.  One finds one's analogy in electricity.  If insulation is imperfect, the
 whole current goes back to earth.  It is useless to plead that in all those mi
les of wire there is only one-hundredth of an inch unprotected.  It is no good
building a ship if the water can enter, through however small a hole.
    That first task of the Magician in every ceremony is therefore to render hi
s Circle absolutely impregnable.>  If one littlest thought intrude upon the min
d of the Mystic, his concentration is absolutely destroyed; and his consciousne
ss remains on exactly the same level as the Stockbroker's.  Even the smallest b
aby is incompatible with the virginity of its mother.  If you leave even a sing
le spirit within the circle, the effect of the conjuration will be entirely abs
orbed by it.>  {101}
   The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of purificati
on, "firstly", of himself, "secondly", of his instruments, "thirdly", of the pl
ace of working.  Ancient Magicians recommended a preliminary purification of fr
om three days to many months.  During this period of training they took the utm
ost pains with diet.  They avoided animal food, lest the elemental spirit of th
e animal should get into their atmosphere.  They practised sexual abstinence, l
est they should be influenced in any way by the spirit of the wife.  Even in re
gard to the excrements of the body they were equally careful; in trimming the h
air and nails, they ceremonially destroyed> the severed portion.  They fasted,
so that the body itself might destroy anything extraneous to the bare necessity
 of its existence.  They purified the mind by special prayers and conservations
.  They avoided the contamination of social intercourse, especially the conjuga
l kind; and their servitors were disciples specially chosen and consecrated for
 the work.
   In modern times our superior understanding of the essentials of this process
 enables us to dispense to some extent with its external rigours; but the inter
nal purification must be even more carefully performed.  We may eat meat, provi
ded that in doing so we affirm that we eat it in order to strengthen us for the
 special purpose of our proposed invocation.>  {102}
   By thus avoiding those actions which might excite the comment of our neighbo
urs we avoid the graver dangers of falling into spiritual pride.
   We have understood the saying: "To the pure all things are pure", and we hav
e learnt how to act up to it.  We can analyse the mind far more acutely than co
uld the ancients, and we can therefore distinguish the real and right feeling f
rom its imitations.  A man may eat meat from self-indulgence, or in order to av
oid the dangers of asceticism.  We must constantly examine ourselves, and assur
e ourselves that every action is really subservient to the One Purpose.
   It is ceremonially desirable to seal and affirm this mental purity by Ritual
, and accordingly the first operation in any actual ceremony is bathing and rob
ing, with appropriate words.  The bath signifies the removal of all things extr
aneous to antagonistic to the one thought.  The putting on of the robe is the p
ositive side of the same operation.  It is the assumption of the fame of mind s
uitable to that one thought.
   A similar operation takes place in the preparation of every instrument, as h
as been seen in the Chapter devoted to that subject.  In the preparation of the
 place of working, the same considerations apply.  We first remove from that pl
ace all objects; and we then put into it those objects, and only those {103} ob
jects, which are necessary.  During many days we occupy ourselves in this proce
ss of cleansing and consecration; and this again is confirmed in the actual cer
emony.
   The cleansed and consecrated Magician takes his cleansed and consecrated ins
truments into that cleansed and consecrated place, and there proceeds to repeat
 that double ceremony in the ceremony itself, which has these same two main par
ts.  The first part of every ceremony is the banishing; the second, the invokin
g.  The same formula is repeated even in the ceremony of banishing itself, for
in the banishing ritual of the pentagram we not only command the demons to depa
rt, but invoke the Archangels and their hosts to act as guardians of the Circle
 during our pre-occupation with the ceremony proper.
   In more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name.  Each
 element, each planet, and each sign, perhaps even the Sephiroth themselves; al
l are removed, including the very one which we wished to invoke, for that force
s as existing in Nature is always impure.  But this process, being long and wea
risome, is not altogether advisable in actual working.  It is usually sufficien
t to perform a general banishing, and to rely upon the aid of the guardians inv
oked.  Let the banishing therefore be short, but in no wise slurred --- for it
is useful as it tends to produce the proper attitude of mind for the invocation
s.  "The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram" (as now rewritten, Liber 333, Cap.
XXV) is the best to use.>  Only the four elements are specifically mentioned, b
ut these four elements contain the planets and the signs> --- the four elements
 are Tetragrammaton; and Tetragrammaton is the Universe.  This special precauti
on is, however, necessary: make exceedingly sure that the ceremony of banishing
 is effective!  {104} Be alert and on your guard!  Watch before you pray!  The
feeling of success in banishing, once acquired, is unmistakable.
   At the conclusion, it is usually well to pause for a few moments, and to mak
e sure once more that every thing necessary to the ceremony is in its right pla
ce.  The Magician may then proceed to the final consecration of the furniture o
f the Temple.>

                       OF THE CONSECRATIONS:

                       WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE

               NATURE AND NURTURE OF THE MAGICAL LINK.

   Consecration is the active dedication of a thing to a single purpose.  Banis
hing prevents its use for any other purpose, but it remains inert until consecr
ated.  Purification is performed by water, and banishing by air, whose weapon i
s the sword.  Consecration is performed by fire, usually symbolised by the holy
 lamp.>
   In most extant magical rituals the two operations are performed at once; or
(at least) the banishing has the more important place, and greater pains seem t
o be taken with it; but as the student advances to Adeptship the banishing will
 diminish in importance, for it will no longer be so necessary.  The Circle of
the Magician will have been perfected by his habit of Magical work.  In the tru
est sense of that word, he will never step outside the Circle during his whole
life.  But the consecration, being the application of a positive force, can alw
ays be raised to a closer approximation to perfection.  Complete success in ban
ishing is soon attained; but there can be no completeness in the advance to hol
iness.  {106}
   The method of consecration is very simple.  Take the wand, or the holy oil,
and draw upon the object to be consecrated the supreme symbol of the force to w
hich you dedicate it.  Confirm this dedication in words, invoking the appropria
te God to indwell that pure temple which you have prepared for Him.  Do this wi
th fervour and love, as if to balance the icy detachment which is the proper me
ntal attitude for banishing.>
 The words of purification are: Asperges me, Therion, hyssopo, et mundabor; lav
abis me, et super nivem dealbabor.
   Those of consecration are: Accendat in nobis Therion ignem sui amoris et fla
mmam aeternae caritatis.>
   These, as initiates of the VII Degree of O.T.O. are aware, mean more than ap
pears.

                                II
   It is a strange circumstance that no Magical writer has hitherto treated the
 immensely important subject of the Magical Link.  It might almost be called th
e Missing Link.  It has apparently always been taken for granted, only lay writ
ers on Magick like Dr. J. G. Frazer have accorded the subject its full importan
ce.
   Let us try to make considerations of the nature of Magick in a strictly scie
ntific spirit, as well as, deprived of the guidance of antiquity, we may.
   What is a Magical Operation?  It may be defined as any event in nature which
 is brought to pass by Will.  We must not exclude potato-growing or banking fro
m our definition.  {107}
   Let us take a very simple example of a Magical Act: that of a man blowing hi
s nose.  What are the conditions of the success of the Operation? Firstly, that
 the man's Will should be to blow his nose; secondly, that he should have a nos
e capable of being blown; thirdly, that he should have at command an apparatus
capable of expressing his spiritual Will in terms of material force, and applyi
ng that force to the object which he desires to affect.  His Will may be as str
ong and concentrated as that of Jupiter, and his nose may be totally incapable
of resistance; but unless the link is made by the use of his nerves and muscles
 in accordance with psychological, physiological, and physical law, the nose wi
ll remain unblown through all eternity.
   Writers of Magick have been unsparing in their efforts to instruct us in the
 preparation of the Will, but they seem to have imagined that no further precau
tion was necessary.  There is a striking case of an epidemic of this error whos
e history is familiar to everybody.  I refer to Christian Science, and the cogn
ate doctrines of "mental healing" and the like.  The theory of such people, str
ipped of dogmatic furbelows, is perfectly good Magic of its kind, its negroid k
ind.  The idea is correct enough: matter is an illusion created by Will through
 mind, and consequently susceptible of alteration at the behest of its creator.
  But the practice has been lacking.  They have not developed a scientific tech
nique for applying the Will.  It is as if they expected the steam of Watts' ket
tle to convey people from place to place without the trouble of inventing and u
sing locomotives.
   Let us apply these considerations to Magick in its restricted sense, the sen
se in which it was always understood until the Master Therion extended it to co
ver the entire operations of Nature.
   What is the theory implied in such rituals as those of the Goetia?  What doe
s the Magician do?  He applies himself to invoke a God, and this God compels th
e appearance of a spirit whose function is to perform the Will of the magician
at the moment.  There is no trace of what may be called machinery in the method
.  The exorcist hardly takes the pains of preparing a material basis for the sp
irit to incarnate except the bare connection {108} of himself with his sigil.
It is apparently assumed that the spirit already possesses the means of working
 on matter.  The conception seems to be that of a schoolboy who asks his father
 to tell the butler to do something for him.  In other words, the theory is gro
ssly animistic.  The savage tribes described by Frazer had a far more scientifi
c theory.  The same may be said of witches, who appear to have been wiser than
the thaumaturgists who despised them.  They at least made waxen images --- iden
tified by baptism --- of the people they wished to control.  They at least used
 appropriate bases for Magical manifestations, such as blood and other vehicles
 of animal force, with those of vegetable virtue such as herbs.  They were also
 careful to put their bewitched products into actual contact --- material or as
tral --- with their victims.  The classical exorcists, on the contrary, for all
 their learning, were careless about this essential condition.  They acted as s
tupidly as people who should write business letters and omit to post them.
   It is not too much to say that this failure to understand the conditions of
success accounts for the discredit into which Magick fell until Eliphas Levi un
dertook the task of re-habilitating it two generations ago.  But even he (profo
undly as he studied, and luminously as he expounded, the nature of Magick consi
dered as a universal formula) paid no attention whatever to that question of th
e Magical Link, though he everywhere implies that it is essential to the Work.
 He evaded the question by making the "petitio principii" of assigning to the A
stral Light the power of transmitting vibrations of all kinds.  He nowhere ente
rs into detail as to how its effects are produced.  He does not inform us as to
 the qualitative or quantitative laws of this light.  (The scientifically train
ed student will observe the analogy between Levi's postulate and that of ordina
ry science "in re" the luminiferous ether.)
   It is deplorable that nobody should have recorded in a systematic form the r
esults of our investigations of the Astral Light.  We have no account of its pr
operties or of the laws which obtain in its sphere.  Yet these are sufficiently
 remarkable.  We may briefly notice that, in the Astral Light, two or more obje
cts can {109} occupy the same space at the same time without interfering with e
ach other or losing their outlines.
   In that Light, objects can change their appearance completely without suffer
ing change of Nature.  The same thing can reveal itself in an infinite number o
f different aspects; in fact, it identifies itself by so doing, much as a write
r or a painter reveals himself in a succession of novels or pictures, each of w
hich is wholly himself and nothing else, but himself under varied conditions, t
hough each appears utterly different from its fellows.  In that Light one is "s
wift without feet and flying without wings"; one can travel without moving, and
 communicate without conventional means of expression.  One is insensible to he
at, cold, pain, and other forms of apprehension, at least in the shapes which a
re familiar to us in our bodily vehicles.  They exist, but they are appreciated
 by us, and they affect us, in a different manner.  In the Astral Light we are
bound by what is, superficially, an entirely different series of laws.  We meet
 with obstacles of a strange and subtle character; and we overcome them by an e
nergy and cunning of an order entirely alien to that which serves us in earthly
 life.  In that Light, symbols are not conventions but realities, yet (on the c
ontrary) the beings whom we encounter are only symbols of the realities of our
own nature.  Our operations in that Light are really the adventures of our own
personified thoughts.  The universe is a projection of ourselves; an image as u
nreal as that of our faces in a mirror, yet, like that face, the necessary form
 of expression thereof, not to be altered save as we alter ourselves.>  The mir
ror may {110} be distorted, dull, clouded, or cracked; and to this extent, the
reflection of ourselves may be false even in respect of its symbolic presentati
on.  In that Light, therefore, all that we do is to discover ourselves by means
 of a sequence of hieroglyphics, and the changes which we apparently operate ar
e in an objective sense illusions.
   But the Light servers us in this way.  It enables us to see ourselves, and t
herefore to aid us to initiate ourselves by showing us what we are doing.  In t
he same way a watchmaker uses a lens, though it exaggerates and thus falsifies
the image of the system of wheels which he is trying to adjust.  In the same wa
y, a writer employs arbitrary characters according to a meaningless convention
in order to enable his reader by retranslating them to obtain an approximation
to his idea.
   Such are a few of the principal characteristics Astral Light.  Its quantitat
ive laws are much less dissimilar from those of material physics.  Magicians ha
ve too often been foolish enough to suppose that all classes of Magical Operati
ons were equally easy.  They seem to have assumed that the "almighty power of G
od" was an infinite quantity in presence of which all finites were equally insi
gnificant.  "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years" is their first law o
f Motion.  "Faith can move mountains" they say, and disdain to measure either t
he faith or the mountains.  If you can kill a chicken by Magick, why not destro
y an army with equal exertion? "With God all things are possible."
   This absurdity is an error of the same class as that mentioned above.  The f
acts are wholly opposed.  Two and two make four in the Astral as rigorously as
anywhere else.  The distance of one's Magical target and the accuracy of one's
Magical rifle are factors in the success of one's Magical shooting in just the
same way as at Bisley.  The law of Magical gravitation is as rigid as that of N
ewton.  The law of Inverse Squares may not apply; but some {111} such law does
apply.  So it is for everything.  You cannot produce a thunderstorm unless the
materials exist in the air at the time, and a Magician who could make rain in C
umberland might fail lamentably in the Sahara.  One might make a talisman to wi
n the love of a shop-girl and find it work, yet be baffled in the case of a cou
ntess; or vice versa.  One might impose one's Will on a farm, and be crushed by
 that of a city; or vice versa.  The MASTER THERION himself, with all his succe
sses in every kind of Magick, sometimes appears utterly impotent to perform fea
ts which almost any amateur might do, because He has matched his Will against t
hat of the world, having undertaken the Work of a Magus to establish the word o
f His Law on the whole of mankind.  He will succeed, without doubt, but He hard
ly expects to see more than a sample of His product during His present incarnat
ion.  But He refuses to waste the least fraction of His force on works foreign
to His WORK, however obvious it may seem to the onlooker that His advantage lie
s in commanding stones to become bread, or otherwise making things easy for Him
self.
   These considerations being thoroughly understood we may return to the questi
on of making the Magical Link.  In the case above cited FRATER PERDURABO compos
ed His talisman by invoking His Holy Guardian Angel according to the Sacred Mag
ick of Abramelin the Mage.  That Angel wrote on the lamen the Word of the Aeon.
  The Book of the Law is this writing.  To this lamen the Master Therion gave l
ife by devoting His own life thereto.  We may then regard this talisman, the La
w, as the most powerful that has been made in the world's history, for previous
 talismans of the same type have been limited in their scope by conditions of r
ace and country.  Mohammed's talisman, Allah, was good only from Persia to the
Pillars of Hercules.  The Buddha's, Anatta, operated only in the South and East
 of Asia.  The new talisman, Thelema, is master of the planet.
   But now observe how the question of the Magical Link arises!  No matter how
mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless it is applied to any by m
ankind.  As long as the Book of the Law was in Manuscript, it could only affect
 the small group amongst whom it was circulated.  It had to be put into action
by {112} the Magical Operation of publishing it.  When this was done, it was do
ne without proper perfection.  Its commands as to how the work ought to be done
 were not wholly obeyed.  There were doubt and repugnance in FRATER PERDURABO's
 mind, and they hampered His work.  He was half-hearted.  Yet, even so then int
rinsic power of the truth of the Law and the impact of the publication were suf
ficient to shake the world so that a critical war broke out, and the minds of m
en were moved in a mysterious manner.  The second blow was struck by the re-pub
lication of the Book in September 1913, and this time the might of this Magick
burst out and caused a catastrophe to civilization.  At this hour, the MASTER T
HERION is concealed, collecting his forces for a final blow.  When The Book of
the Law and its Comment is published, with the forces of His whole Will in perf
ect obedience to the instructions which have up to now been misunderstood or ne
glected, the result will be incalculably effective.  The event will establish t
he kingdom of the Crowned and Conquering Child over the whole earth, and all me
n shall bow to the Law, which is "love under will".
   This is an extreme case; but there is one law only to govern the small as th
e great.  The same laws describe and measure the motions of the ant and the sta
rs.  Their light is no swifter than that of a spark.  In every operation of Mag
ick the link must be properly made.  The first requisite is the acquisition of
adequate force of the kind required for the purpose.  We must have electricity
of a certain potential in sufficient amount if we wish to heat food in a furnac
e.  We shall need a more intense current and a greater supply to light a city t
han to charge a telephone wire.  No other kind of force will do.  We cannot use
 the force of steam directly to impel an aeroplane, or to get drunk.  We must a
pply it in adequate strength in an appropriate manner.
   It is therefore absurd to invoke the spirit of Venus to procure us the love
of an Empress, unless we take measures to transmit the influence of our work to
 the lady.  We may for example consecrate a letter expressing our Will; or, if
we know how, we may use some object connected with the person whose acts we are
 attempting to control, such as a lock of hair or a handkerchief {113} once bel
onging to her, and so in subtile connection with her aura.  But for material en
ds it is better to have material means.  We must not rely on fine gut in trolli
ng for salmon.  Our will to kill a tiger is poorly conveyed by a charge of smal
l shot fired at a range of one hundred yards.  Our talisman must, therefore, be
 an object suitable to the nature of our Operation, and we must have some such
means of applying its force to such a way as will naturally compel the obedienc
e of the portion of Nature which we are trying to change.  If one will the deat
h of a sinner, it is not sufficient to hate him, even if we grant that the vibr
ations of thought, when sufficiently powerful and pure, may modify the Astral l
ight sufficiently to impress its intention to a certain extent on such people a
s happen to be sensitive.  It is much surer to use one's mind and muscle in ser
vice of that hate by devising and making a dagger, and then applying the dagger
 to the heart of one's enemy.  One must give one's hate a bodily form of the sa
me order as that which one's enemy has taken for his manifestation.  Your spiri
t can only come into contact with his by means of this magical manufacture of p
hantoms; in the same way, one can only measure one's mind (a certain part of it
) against another man's by expressing them in some such form as the game of che
ss.  One cannot use chessmen against another man unless he agree to use them in
 the same sense as you do.  The board and men form the Magical Link by which yo
u can prove your power to constrain him to yield.  The game is a device by whic
h you force him to turn down his king in surrender, a muscular act made in obed
ience to your will, thought he may be twice your weight and strength.
   These general principles should enable the student to understand the nature
of the work of making the Magical Link.  It is impossible to give detailed inst
ructions, because every case demands separate consideration.  It is sometimes e
xceedingly difficult to devise proper measures.
   Remember that Magick includes all acts soever.  Anything may serve as a Magi
cal weapon.  To impose one's Will on a nation, for instance, one's talisman may
 be a newspaper, one's triangle a church, or one's circle a Club.  To win a wom
an, one's {114} pantacle may be a necklace; to discover a treasure, one's wand
may be a dramatist's pen, or one's incantation a popular song.
   Many ends, many means: it is only important to remember the essence of the o
peration, which is to will its success with sufficiently pure intensity, and to
 incarnate that will in a body suitable to express it, a body such that its imp
act on the bodily expression of the idea one wills to change is to cause it to
do so.  For instance, is it my will to become a famous physician?  I banish all
 "hostile spirits" such as laziness, alien interests, and confliction pleasures
, from my "circle" the hospital; I consecrate my "weapons" (my various abilitie
s) to the study of medicine; I invoke the "Gods" (medical authorities) by study
ing and obeying their laws in their books.  I embody the "Formulae" (the ways i
n which causes and effects influence disease) in a "Ritual" (my personal style
of constraining sickness to conform with my will).  I persist in these conjurat
ions year after year, making the Magical gestures of healing the sick, until I
compel the visible appearance of the Spirit of Time, and make him acknowledge m
e his master.  I have used the appropriate kind of means, in adequate measure,
and applied them in ways pertinent to my purpose by projecting my incorporeal i
dea of ambition in a course of action such as to induce in others the incorpore
al idea of satisfying mine.  I made my Will manifest to sense; sense swayed the
 Wills of my fellowmen; mind wrought on mind through matter.
   I did not "sit for" a medical baronetcy by wishing I had it, or by an "act o
f faith", or by praying to God "to move Pharaoh's heart", as our modern mental,
 or our mediaeval, mystic, miracle-mongers were and are muddlers and maudlin en
ough to advise us to do.
   A few general observations on the Magical Link may not be amiss, in default
of details; one cannot make a Manual of How to Go Courting, with an Open-Sesame
 to each particular Brigand's Cavern, any more than one can furnish a budding b
urglar with a directory containing the combination of every existing safe.  But
 one can point out the broad distinctions between women who yield, some to flat
tery, some to eloquence, some to appearance, some to rank, some to wealth, some
 to ardour, and some to authority.  We {115} cannot exhaust the combinations of
 Lover's Chess, but we may enumerate the principal gambits: the Bouquet, the Ch
ocolates, the Little Dinner, the Cheque-Book, the Poem, the Motor by Moonlight,
 the Marriage Certificate, the Whip, and the Feigned Flight.
   The Magical Link may be classified under three main heads; as it involves (1
) one plane and one person, (2) one plane and two or more persons, (3) two plan
es.
   In class (1) the machinery of Magick --- the instrument --- already exists.
 Thus, I may wish to heal my own body, increase my own energy; develop my own m
ental powers, or inspire my own imagination.  Here the Exorcist and the Demon a
re already connected, consciously or subconsciously, by an excellent system of
symbols.  The Will is furnished by Nature with an apparatus adequately equipped
 to convey and execute its orders.
   It is only necessary to inflame the Will to the proper pitch and to issue it
s commands; they are instantly obeyed, unless --- as in the case of organic dis
ease --- the apparatus is damaged beyond the art of Nature to repair.  It may b
e necessary in such a case to assist the internal "spirits" by the "purificatio
n" of medicines, the "banishing" of diet, or some other extraneous means.
   But at least there is no need of any special device "ad hoc" to effect conta
ct between the Circle and the Triangle.  Operations of this class are therefore
 often successful, even when the Magician has little or no technical knowledge
of Magick.  Almost any duffer can "pull himself together", devote himself to st
udy, break off a bad habit, or conquer a cowardice.  This class of work, althou
gh the easiest, is yet the most important; for it includes initiation itself in
 its highest sense.  It extends to the Absolute in every dimension; it involves
 the most intimate analysis, and the most comprehensive synthesis.  In a sense,
 it is the sole type of Magick either necessary or proper to the Adept; for it
includes both the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guar
dian Angel, and the Adventure of the Abyss.
   The second class includes all operations by which the Magician strives to im
pose his Will upon objects outside his own control, but within that of such oth
er wills as are symbolised by means of {116} a system similar to his own.  That
 is, they can be compelled naturally by cognate consciousness.
   For instance, one may wish to obtain the knowledge put forth in this book.
Not knowing that such a book exists, one might yet induce some one who knows of
 it to offer a copy.  Thus one's operation would consist in inflaming one's Wil
l to possess the knowledge to the point of devoting one's life to it, in expres
sing that will by seeking out people who seem likely to know what is needed, an
d in imposing it on them by exhibiting such enthusiastic earnestness that they
will tell the enquirer that this book will meet his needs.
   Does this sound too simple?  Can this obvious common-sense course be really
that marvellous Magick that frightens folk so?  Yes, even this triviality is on
e instance of how Magick works.
   But the above practical programme may be a fiasco.  One might then resort to
 Magick in the conventional sense of the word, by constructing and charging a P
antacle appropriate to the object; this Pantacle should then cause a strain in
the Astral Light such that the vibrations would compel some alien consciousness
 to restore equilibrium by bringing the book.
   Suppose a severer and more serious aim; suppose that I wish to win a woman w
ho dislikes me and loves somebody else.  In this case, not only her Will, but h
er lover's must be overcome by my own.  I have no direct control of either.  Bu
t my Will is in touch with the woman's by means of our minds; I have only to ma
ke my mind the master of hers by the existing means of communication; her mind
will then present its recantation to her Will, her Will repeal its decision, an
d her body submit to mine as the seal of her surrender.
   Here the Magical Link exists; only it is complex instead of simple as in the
 First Class.
 There is opportunity for all kinds of error in the transmission of the Will; m
isunderstanding may mar the matter; a mood may make mischief; external events m
ay interfere; the lover may match me in Magick; the Operation itself may offend
 nature in many ways; for instance, if there is a subconscious incompatibility
between myself and the woman, I deceive myself into thinking {117} that I desir
e her.  Such a flaw is enough to bring the whole operation to naught, just as n
o effort of Will can make oil mix with water.
   I may work "naturally" by wooing, of course.  But, magically, I may attack h
er astrally so that her aura becomes uneasy, responding no longer to her lover.
  Unless they diagnose the cause, a quarrel may result, and the woman's bewilde
red and hungry Body of Light may turn in its distress to that of the Magician w
ho has mastered it.
   Take a third case of this class 2.  I wish to recover my watch, snatched fro
m me in a crowd.
   Here I have no direct means of control over the muscles that could bring bac
k my watch, or over the mind that moves these muscles.  I am not even able to i
nform that mind of my Will, for I do not know where it is.  But I know it to be
 a mind fundamentally like my own, and I try to make a Magical Link with it by
advertising my loss in the hope of reaching it, being careful to calm it by pro
mising it immunity, and to appeal to its own known motive by offering a reward.
  I also attempt to use the opposite formula; to reach it by sending my "famili
ar spirits", the police, to hunt it, and compel its obedience by threats.>
   Again, a sorcerer might happen to possess an object belonging magically to a
 rich man, such as a compromising letter, which is really as much part of him a
s his liver; he may then master the will of that man by intimidating his mind.
 His power to publish the letter is as effective as if he could injure the man'
s body directly.
   These "natural" cases may be transposed into subtler terms; for instance, on
e might master another man, even a stranger, by sheer concentration of will, ce
remonially or otherwise wrought up to the requisite potential.  But in one way
or another that will must be {118} made to impinge on the man; by the normal me
ans of contact if possible, if not, by attacking some sensitive spot in his sub
conscious sensorium.  But the heaviest rod will not land the smallest fish unle
ss there be a line of some sort fixed firmly to both.
   The Third Class is characterized by the absence of any existing link between
 the Will of the Magician and that controlling the object to be affected.  (The
 Second Class may approximate to the Third when there is no possibility of appr
oaching the second mind by normal means, as sometimes happens).
   This class of operations demands not only immense knowledge of the technique
 of Magick combined with tremendous vigour and skill, but a degree of Mystical
attainment which is exceedingly rare, and when found is usually marked by an ab
solute apathy on the subject of any attempt to achieve any Magick at all.  Supp
ose that I wish to produce a thunderstorm.  This event is beyond my control or
that of any other man; it is as useless to work on their minds as my own.  Natu
re is independent of, and indifferent to, man's affairs.  A storm is caused by
atmospheric conditions on a scale so enormous that the united efforts of all us
 Earth-vermin could scarcely disperse one cloud, even if we could get at it.  H
ow then can any Magician, he who is above all things a knower of Nature, be so
absurd as to attempt to throw the Hammer of Thor?  Unless he be simply insane,
he must be initiated in a Truth which transcends the apparent facts.  He must b
e aware that all nature is a continuum, so that his mind and body are consubsta
ntial with the storm, are equally expressions of One Existence, all alike of th
e self-same order of artifices whereby the Absolute appreciates itself.  He mus
t also have assimilated the fact that the Quantity is just as much a form as Qu
ality; that as all things are modes of One Substance, so their measures are mod
es of their relation.  Not only are gold and lead mere letters, meaningless in
themselves yet appointed to spell the One Name; but the difference between the
bulk of a mountain and that of a mouse is no more than one method of differenti
ating them, just as the letter "m" is not bigger than the letter "i: in any rea
l sense of the word.> {119}
   Our Magician, with this in his mind, will most probably leave thunderstorms
to stew in their own juice; but, should he decide (after all) to enliven the af
ternoon, he will work in the manner following.
   First, what are the elements necessary for his storms?  He must have certain
 stores of electrical force, and the right kind of clouds to contain it.
   He must see that the force does not leak away to earth quietly and slyly.
   He must arrange a stress so severe as to become at last so intolerable that
it will disrupt explosively.
   Now he, as a man, cannot pray to God to cause them, for the Gods are but nam
es for the forces of Nature themselves.
 But, "as a Mystic", he knows that all things are phantoms of One Thing, and th
at they may be withdrawn therein to reissue in other attire.  He knows that all
 things are in himself, and that he is All-One with the All.  There is therefor
e no theoretical difficulty about converting the illusion of a clear sky into t
hat of a tempest.  On the other hand, he is aware, "as a Magician", that illusi
ons are governed by the laws of their nature.  He knows that twice two is four,
 although both "two" and "four" are merely properties pertaining to One.  He ca
n only use the Mystical identity of all things in a strictly scientific sense.
 It is true that his experience of clear skies and storms proves that his natur
e contains elements cognate with both; for it not, they could not affect him.
He is the Microcosm of his own Macrocosm, whether or no either one or the other
 extend beyond his knowledge of them.  He must therefore arouse in himself thos
e ideas which are clansmen of the Thunderstorm, collect all available objects o
f the same nature for talismans, and proceed to excite all these to the utmost
by a Magical ceremony; that is, by insisting on their godhead, so that they fla
me within and without him, his ideas vitalising the talismans.  There is thus a
 vivid vibration of high potential in a certain group {121} of sympathetic subs
tances and forces; and this spreads as do the waves from a stone thrown into a
lake, widening and weakening; till the disturbance is compensated.  Just as a h
andful of fanatics, insane with one over-emphasised truth, may infect a whole c
ountry for a time by inflaming that thought in their neighbours, so the Magicia
n creates a commotion by disturbing the balance of power.  He transmits his par
ticular vibration as a radio operator does with his ray; rate-relation determin
es exclusive selection.
   In practice, the Magician must "evoke the spirits of the storm" by identifyi
ng himself with the ideas of which atmospheric phenomena are the expressions as
 his humanity is of him; thus achieved, he must impose his Will upon them by vi
rtue of the superiority of his intelligence and the integration of his purpose
to their undirected impulses and uncomprehending interplay.
   All such Magick demands the utmost precision in practice.  It is true that t
he best rituals give us instructions in selecting our vehicles of force.  In 77
7 we find "correspondences" of many classes of being with the various types of
operation, so that we know what weapons, jewels, figures, drugs, perfumes, name
s, etc. to employ in any particular work.  But it has always been assumed that
the invoked force is intelligent and competent, that it will direct itself as d
esired without further ado, by this method of sympathetic vibrations.
   The necessity of timing the force has been ignored; and so most operations,
even when well performed as far as invocation goes, are as harmless as igniting
 loose gunpowder.
   But, even allowing that Will is sufficient to determine the direction, and p
revent the dispersion of the force, we can hardly be sure that it will act on i
ts object, unless that object be properly prepared to receive it.  The Link mus
t be perfectly made.  The object must possess in itself a sufficiency of stuff
sympathetic to our work.  We cannot make love to a brick, or set an oak to run
errands.
   We see, then, that we can never affect anything outside ourselves save only
as it is also within us.  Whatever I do to another, I do also to myself.  If I
kill a man, I destroy my own life at the same time.  That is the magical meanin
g of the so-called {121} "Golden Rule", which should not be in the imperative b
ut in the indicative mood.  Every vibration awakens all others of its particula
r pitch.
   There is thus some justification for the assumption of previous writers on M
agick that the Link is implicit, and needs no special attention.  Yet, in pract
ice, there is nothing more certain than that one ought to confirm one's will by
 all possible acts on all possible planes.  The ceremony must not be confined t
o the formally magical rites.  We must neglect no means to our end, neither des
pising our common sense, nor doubting our secret wisdom.
   When Frater I. A. was in danger of death in 1899 e.v.  Frater V. N. and FRAT
ER PERDURABO did indeed invoke the spirit Buer to visible manifestation that th
e might heal their brother; but also one of them furnished the money to send hi
m to a climate less cruel than England's.  He is alive to day>; who cares wheth
er spirits or shekels wrought that which these Magicians willed?
 Let the Magical Link be made strong!  It is "love under will"; it affirms the
identity of the Equation of the work; it makes success Necessity.

                                 CHAPTER XVI

                                  "(Part I)"

                                 OF THE OATH


   The third operation in any magical ceremony is the oath or proclamation.  Th
e Magician, armed and ready, stands in the centre of the Circle, and strikes on
ce upon the bell as if to call the attention of the Universe.  He then declares
 "who he is", reciting his magical history by the proclamation of the grades wh
ich he has attained, giving the signs and words of those grades.>
   He then states the purpose of the ceremony, and proves that it is necessary
to perform it and to succeed in its performance.  He then takes an oath before
the Lord of the Universe (not before the particular Lord whom he is invoking) a
s if to call Him to witness to the act.  He swears solemnly that he will perfor
m it --- that nothing shall prevent him from performing it --- that he will not
 leave the operation until it is successfully performed --- and once again he s
trikes upon the bell.
   Yet, having demonstrated himself in that position at once infinitely lofty a
nd infinitely unimportant, the instrument of destiny, he balances this by the "
Confession", in which there is again an infinite exaltation harmonised with an
infinite humility.  He admits himself to be a weak human being humbly aspiring
to something higher; a creature of circumstance utterly dependent --- even for
the breath of life --- upon a series of fortunate accidents.  {123} He makes th
is confession prostrate> before the altar in agony and bloody sweat.  He trembl
es at the thought of the operation which he has dared to undertake, saying, "Fa
ther, if it be Thy Will, let this cup pass from me!  Nevertheless not my will b
ut Thine be done!">
   The dread answer comes that It Must Be, and this answer so fortifies him wit
h holy zeal that it will seem to him as if he were raised by divine hands from
that prostrate position; with a thrill of holy exaltation he renews joyfully th
e Oath, feeling himself once again no longer the man but the Magician, yet not
merely the Magician, but the chosen and appointed person to accomplish a task w
hich, however apparently unimportant, is yet an integral part of universal dest
iny, so that if it were not accomplished the Kingdom of Heaven would be burst i
n pieces.
   He is now ready to commence the invocations.  He consequently pauses to cast
 a last glance around the Temple to assure himself of the perfect readiness of
all things necessary, and to light the incense.

                            ---------

   The Oath is the foundation of all Work in Magick, as it is an affirmation of
 the Will.  An Oath binds the Magician for ever.  In Part II of Book 4 somethin
g has already been said on this subject; but its importance deserves some furth
er elaboration.  Thus, should one, loving a woman, make a spell to compel her e
mbraces, and tiring of her a little later, evoke Zazel to kill her; he will fin
d that the implications of his former Oath conflict with those proper to invoke
 the Unity of the Godhead of Saturn.  Zazel will refuse to obey him in the case
 of the woman whom he has sworn that he loves.  To this some may object that, s
ince all acts are magical, every man who loves a woman implicitly takes an {124
} Oath of love, and therefore would never be able to murder her later, as we fi
nd to be the not uncommon case.  The explanation is as follows.  It is perfectl
y true that when Bill Sykes desires to possess Nancy, he does in fact evoke a s
pirit of the nature of Venus, constraining him by his Oath of Love (and by his
magical power as a man) to bring him the girl.  So also, when he wants to kill
her, he evokes a Martial or Saturnian spirit, with an Oath of hate.  But these
are not pure planetary spirits, moving in well-defined spheres by rigidly right
eous laws.  They are gross concretions of confused impulses, "incapable of unde
rstanding the nature of an oath".  They are also such that the idea of murder i
s nowise offensive to the Spirit of Love.
   It is indeed the criterion of spiritual "caste" that conflicting elements sh
ould not coexist in the same consciousness.  The psalm-singing Puritan who pers
ecutes publicans, and secretly soaks himself in fire-water; the bewhiskered phi
lanthropist in broadcloth who swindles his customers and sweats his employees:
these men must not be regarded as single-minded scoundrels, whose use of religi
on and respectability to cloke their villainies is a deliberate disguise dictat
ed by their criminal cunning.  Far from it, they are only too sincere in their
"virtues"; their terror of death and of supernatural vengeance is genuine; it p
roceeds from a section of themselves which is in irreconcilable conflict with t
heir rascality.  Neither side can conciliate, suppress, or ignore the other; ye
t each is so craven as to endure its enemy's presence.  Such men are therefore
without pure principles; they excuse themselves for every dirty trick that turn
s to their apparent advantage.
   The first step of the Aspirant toward the Gate of Initiation tells him that
purity --- unity of purpose --- is essential above all else.  "Do what thou Wil
t" strikes on him, a ray of fierce white flame consuming all that is not utterl
y God.  Very soon he is aware that he cannot consciously contradict himself.  H
e develops a subtle sense which warns him that two trains of thought which he h
ad never conceived as connected are incompatible.  Yet deeper drives "Do what t
hou wilt"; subconscious oppositions are evoked to visible appearance.  The secr
et sanctuaries of the soul are cleansed.  "Do What thou Wilt" purges his every
part.  He has become One, one only.  His Will is consequently released from {12
5} the interference of internal opposition, and he is a Master of Magick.  But
for that very reason he is now utterly impotent to achieve anything that is not
 in absolute accordance with his Original Oath, with his True Will, by virtue w
hereof he incarnated as a man.  With Bill Sykes love and murder are not mutuall
y exclusive, as they are with King Arthur.  The higher the type of man, the mor
e sensitive he becomes; so that the noblest love divines intuitively when a car
eless word or gesture may wound, and, vigilant, shuns them as being of the fami
ly of murder.  In Magick, likewise, the Adept who is sworn to attain to the Kno
wledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel may in his grosser days have
 been expert as a Healer, to find that he is now incapable of any such work.  H
e will probably be puzzled, and wonder whether he has lost all his power.  Yet
the cause may be no more than that the Wisdom of his Angel depreciates the inte
rference of ignorant kindliness with diseases which may have been sent to the s
ufferer for a purpose profoundly important to his welfare.
 In the case of THE MASTER THERION, he had originally the capacity for all clas
ses of Orgia.  In the beginning, He cured the sick, bewitched the obstinate, al
lured the seductive, routed the aggressive, made himself invisible, and general
ly behaved like a Young-Man-About-town on every possible plane.  He would affli
ct one vampire with a Sending of Cats, and appoint another his private Enchantr
ess, neither aware of any moral oxymoron, nor hampered by the implicit incongru
ity of his oaths.
   But as He advanced in Adeptship, this coltishness found its mouth bitted; as
 soon as He took serious Oaths and was admitted to the Order which we name not,
 those Oaths prevented him using His powers as playthings.  Trifling operations
, such as He once could do with a turn of the wrist, became impossible to the m
ost persistent endeavour.  It was many years before He understood the cause of
this.  But little by little He became so absorbed in the Work of His true Will
that it no longer occurred to Him to indulge in capricious amusements.
   Yet even at this hour, though He be verily a Magus of A.'. A.'., though His
Word be the Word of the Aeon, though He be the Beast 666, the Lord of the Scarl
et Woman "in whom is all power {126} given", there are still certain Orgia beyo
nd Him to perform, because to do so would be to affirm what He hath denied in t
hose Oaths by whose virtue He is That He is.  This is the case, even when the s
pirit of such Orgia is fully consonant with His Will.  The literal sense of His
 original Oath insists that it shall be respected.
   The case offers two instances of this principle.  FRATER PERDURABO specifica
lly swore that he would renounce His personal possessions to the last penny; al
so that He would allow no human affection to hinder Him.  These terms were acce
pted; He was granted infinitely more than He had imagined possible to an incarn
ated Man.  On the other hand, the price offered by Him was exacted as strictly
as if it had been stipulated by Shylock.  Every treasure that he had on earth w
as taken away, and that, usually, in so brutal or cruel a manner as to make the
 loss itself the least part of the pang.  Every human affection that He had in
His heart --- and that heart aches for Love as few hearts can ever conceive ---
 was torn out and trampled with such infernal ingenuity in intensifying torture
 that His endurance is beyond belief.  Inexplicable are the atrocities which ac
companied every step in His Initiation!  Death dragged away His children with s
low savagery; the women He loved drank themselves into delirium and dementia be
fore His eyes, or repaid His passionate devotion with toad-cold treachery at th
e moment when long years of loyalty had tempted Him to trust them.  His friend,
 that bore the bag, stole that which was put therein, and betrayed his Master a
s thoroughly as he was able.  At the first distant rumour that the Pharisees we
re out, his disciples "all forsook Him and fled".  His mother nailed Him with h
er own hands to the cross, and reviled Him as nine years He hung thereupon.
 Now, having endured to the end, being Master of Magick, He is mighty to Work H
is true Will; which Will is, to establish on Earth His Word, the Law of Thelema
.  He hath none other Will than this; so all that He doth is unto this end.  Al
l His Orgia bear fruit; what was the work of a month when He was a full Major A
dept is to day wrought in a few minutes by the Words of Will, uttered with the
right vibrations into the prepared Ear.  {127}
 But neither by the natural use of His abilities, though they have made Him fam
ous through the whole world, nor by the utmost might of his Magick, is He able
to acquire material wealth beyond the minimum necessary to keep Him alive and a
t work.  It is in vain that He protests that not He but the Work is in need of
money; He is barred by the strict letter of His Oath to give all that He hath f
or His magical Attainment.
   Yet more awful is the doom that He hath invoked upon Himself in renouncing H
is right as a man to enjoy the Love of those whom He loves with passion so self
less, so pure, and so intense in return for the power so to love Mankind that H
e be chosen to utter the Word of the Aeon for their sake, His reward universal
abhorrence, bodily torment, mental despair, and moral paralysis.
   Yet He, who hath power over Death, with breath to call back health, with a t
ouch to beckon life, He must watch His own child waste away month by month, awa
re that His Art may not anywise avail, who hath sold the signet ring of his per
sonal profit to buy him a plain gold band for the felon finger of his bride, th
at worn widow, the World!

                            CHAPTER XV


                                 I

                         OF THE INVOCATION


   In the  straightforward or "Protestant" system of Magick there is very littl
e to add to what has already been said.  The Magician addresses a direct petiti
on to the Being invoked.  But the secret of success in invocation has not hithe
rto been disclosed.  It is an exceedingly simple one.  It is practically of no
importance whatever that the invocation should be "right".  There are a thousan
d different ways of compassing the end proposed, so far as external things are
concerned.  The whole secret may be summarised in these four words: "Enflame th
yself in praying.">
   The mind must be exalted until it loses consciousness of self.  The Magician
 must be carried forward blindly by a force which, though in him and of him, is
 by no means that which he in his normal state of consciousness calls I.  Just
as the poet, the lover, the artist, is carried out of himself in a creative fre
nzy, so must it be for the Magician.
   It is impossible to lay down rules for the obtaining of this special stimulu
s.  To one the mystery of the whole ceremony may appeal; another may be moved b
y the strangeness of the words, even by the fact that the "barbarous names" are
 unintelligible to him.  Some times in the course of a ceremony the true meanin
g of some barbarous name that has hitherto baffled his analysis may flash upon
him, luminous and splendid, so that he is caught up unto {129} orgasm.  The sme
ll of a particular incense may excite him effectively, or perhaps the physical
ecstasy of the magick dance.
   Every Magician must compose his ceremony in such a manner as to produce a dr
amatic cilmax.  At the moment when the excitement becomes ungovernable, when th
en the whole conscious being of the Magician undergoes a spiritual spasm, at th
at moment must he utter the supreme adjuration.
 One very effective method is to stop short, by a supreme effort of will, again
 and again, on the very brink of that spasm, until a time arrives when the idea
 of exercising that will fails to occur>.  Inhibition is no longer possible or
even thinkable, and the whole being of the Magician, no minutest atom saying na
y, is irresistibly flung forth.  In blinding light, amid the roar of ten thousa
nd thunders, the Union of God and man is consummated.
   If the Magician is still seen standing in the Circle, quietly pursuing his i
nvocations, it is that all the conscious part of him has become detached from t
he true ego which lies behind that normal consciousness.  But the circle is who
lly filled with that divine essence; all else is but an accident and an illusio
n.
   The subsequent invocations, the gradual development and materialization of t
he force, require no effort.  It is one great mistake of the beginner to concen
trate his force upon the actual stated purpose of the ceremony.  This mistake i
s the most frequent cause of failures in invocation.
   A corollary of this Theorem is that the Magician soon discards evocation alm
ost altogether --- only rare circumstances demand any action what ever on the m
aterial plane.  The Magician devotes himself entirely to the invocation of a go
d; and as soon as his balance approaches perfection he ceases to invoke any par
tial god; only that god vertically above him is in his path.  And so a man who
perhaps took up Magick merely with the idea of acquiring knowledge, love, or we
alth, finds himself irrevocably committed to the performance of "The Great Work
."  {130}
   It will now be apparent that there is no distinction between magick and medi
tation except of the most arbitrary and accidental kind.>

                              II

   Beside these open methods thee are also a number of mental methods of Invoca
tion, of which we may give three.
   The first method concerns the so-called astral body.  The Magician should pr
actise the formation of this body as recommended in Liber O, and learn to rise
on the planes according to the instruction given in the same book, though limit
ing his "rising" to the particular symbol whose God he wishes to invoke.
   The second is to recite a mantra suitable to the God.
   The third is the assumption of the form of the God --- by transmuting the as
tral body into His shape.  This last method is really essential to all proper i
nvocation, and cannot be too sedulously practised.
   There are many other devices to aid invocation, so many that it is impossibl
e to enumerate them; and the Magician will be wise to busy himself in inventing
 new ones.
   We will give one example.
 Suppose the Supreme Invocation to consist of 20 to 30 barbarous names, let him
 imagine these names to occupy sections of a vertical column, each double the l
ength of the preceding one; and let him imagine that his consciousness ascends
the column with each name.  The mere multiplication will then produce a feeling
 of awe and bewilderment which is the proper forerunner of exstasy.
   In the essay "Energized Enthusiasm" in No. IX, Vol. I of the Equinox> is giv
en a concise account of one of the classical methods of arousing Kundalini.  Th
is essay should be studied with care and determination.

                               CHAPTER XVI

                               ("Part II")

                       OF THE CHARGE TO THE SPIRIT
                        WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE
               CONSTRAINTS AND CURSES OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY


                                    I

   On the appearance of the spirit, or the manifestation of the force in the ta
lisman which is being consecrated, it is necessary to bind it by an Oath or Cha
rge.  A spirit should be made to lay its hand visibly on the weapon by whose mi
ght it has been evoked, and to "swear obedience and faith to Him that liveth an
d triumpheth, that regneth above him in His palaces as the Balance of Righteous
ness and Truth" by the names used in the evocation.
   It is then only necessary to formulate the Oath or Charge in language harmon
ious with the previously announced purpose of the operation.
   The precaution indicated is not to let oneself sink into one's humanity whil
e the weapon is extended beyond the Circle.  Were the force to flow from it to
you instead of from you to it, you would be infallibly blasted, or, at the leas
t, become the slave of the spirit.
   At no moment is it more important that the Divine Force should not only fill
, but radiate from, the aura of the Magician.

                                II

   Occasionally it may happen that the spirit is recalcitrant, and refuses to a
ppear.
   Let the Magician consider the cause of such disobedience!  {133}
   It may be that the place or time is wrong.  One cannot easily evoke water-sp
irits in the Sahara, or salamanders in the English Lake District.  Hismael will
 not readily appear when Jupiter is below the horizon.>  In order to counteract
 a natural deficiency of this sort, one would have to supply a sufficient quant
ity of the proper kind of material.  One cannot make bricks without straw.
   With regard to invocations of the Gods, such considerations do not apply.  T
he Gods are beyond most material conditions.  It is necessary to fill the "hear
t" and "mind" with the proper basis for manifestation.  The higher the nature o
f the God, the more true this is.  The Holy Guardian Angel has always the neces
sary basis.  His manifestation depends solely on the readiness of the Aspirant,
 and all magical ceremonies used in that invocation are merely intended to prep
are that Aspirant; not in any way to attract or influence Him.  It is His const
ant and eternal Will> to become one with the Aspirant, and the moment the condi
tions of the latter make it possible, That Bridal is consummated.

                               III

   The obstinacy of a spirit (or the inertial of a talisman) usually implies a
defect in invocation.  The spirit cannot resist even for a moment the constrain
t of his Intelligence, when that Intelligence is working in accordance with the
 Will of the Angel, Archangel {134} and God above him.  It is therefore better
to repeat the Invocations than to proceed at once to curses.
   The Magician should also consider> whether the evocation be in truth a neces
sary part of the Karma of the Universe, as he has stated in his own Oath (See C
ap. XVI, I).  For if this be a delusion, success is impossible.  It will then b
e best to go back to the beginning, and recapitulate with greater intensity and
 power of analysis the Oath and the Invocations.  And this may be done thrice.
   But if this be satisfactorily accomplished, and the spirit be yet disobedien
t, the implication is that some hostile force is at work to hinder the operatio
n.  It will then become advisable to discover the nature of that force, and to
attack and destroy it.  This makes the ceremony more useful than ever to the Ma
gician, who may thereby be led to unveil a black magical gang whose existence h
e had not hitherto suspected.
  His need to check the vampiring of a lady in Paris by a sorceress once led FR
ATER PERDURABO to the discovery of a very powerful body of black magicians, whi
ch whom he was obliged to war for nearly 10 years before their ruin was complet
e and irremediable as it now is.
   Such a discovery will not necessarily impede the ceremony.  A general curse
may be pronounced against the forces hindering the operation (for "ex hypothesi
" no divine force can be interfering) and having thus temporarily dislodged the
m --- for the power of the God invoked will suffice for this purpose --- one ma
y proceed with a certain asperity to conjure the spirit, for that he has done i
ll to bend before the conjurations of the Black Brothers.
 Indeed, some demons are of a nature such that they only understand curses, are
 not amenable to courteous command: ---
                                          "a slave
       Whom stripes may move, not kindness."
   Finally, as a last resource, one may burn the Sigil of the {135} Spirit in a
 black box with stinking substances, all having been properly prepared beforeha
nd, and the magical links properly made, so that he is really tortured by the O
peration.>
   This is a rare event, however.  Only once in the whole of his magical career
 was FRATER PERDURABO driven to so harsh a measure.

                                IV

   In this connexion, beware of too ready a compliance on the part of the spiri
t.  If some Black Lodge has got wind of your operation, it may send the spirit,
 full of hypocritical submission, to destroy you.  Such a spirit will probably
pronounce the oath amiss, or in some way seek to avoid his obligations.
   It is a dangerous trick, though, for the Black Lodge to play; for if the spi
rit come properly under your control, it will be forced to disclose the transac
tion, and the current will return to the Black Lodge with fulminating force.  T
he liars will be in the power of their own lie; their own slaves will rise up a
nd put them into bondage.  The wicked fall into the pit that they themselves di
gged.
  And so perish all the King's enemies!

                              V

   The charge to the spirit is usually embodied, except in works of pure evocat
ion, which after all are comparatively rare, in some kind of talisman.  In a ce
rtain sense, the talisman is the Charge expressed in hieroglyphics.  Yet, every
 object soever is a talisman, for the definition of a talisman is: something up
on which an act of will (that is, of Magick) has been performed in order to fit
 it for a purpose.  Repeated acts of will in respect of {136} any object consec
rate it without further ado.  One knows what miracles can be done with one's fa
vourite mashie!  One has used the mashie again and again, one's love for it gro
wing in proportion to one's success with it, and that success again made more c
ertain and complete by the effect of this "love under will", which one bestows
upon it by using it.
   It is, of course, very important to keep such an abject away from the contac
t of the profane.  It is instinctive not to let another person use one's fishin
g rod or one's gun.  It is not that they could do any harm in a material sense.
  It is the feeling that one's use of these things has consecrated them to one'
s self.
 Of course, the outstanding example of all such talismans is the wife.  A wife
may be defined as an object specially prepared for taking the stamp of one's cr
eative will.  This is an example of a very complicated magical operation, exten
ding over centuries.  But, theoretically, it is just an ordinary case of talism
anic magick.  It is for this reason that so much trouble has been taken to prev
ent a wife having contact with the profane; or, at least, to try to prevent her
.
   Readers of the Bible will remember that Absalom publicly adopted David's wiv
es and concubines on the roof of the palace, in order to signify that he had su
cceeded in breaking his father's magical power.
   Now, there are a great many talismans in this world which are being left lyi
ng about in a most reprehensibly careless manner.  Such are the objects of popu
lar adoration, as ikons, and idols.  But, it is actually true that a great deal
 of real magical Force is locked up in such things; consequently, by destroying
 these sacred symbols, you can overcome magically the people who adore them.
   It is not at all irrational to fight for one's flag, provided that the flag
is an object which really means something to somebody.  Similarly, with the mos
t widely spread and most devotedly worshipped talisman of all,  money, you can
evidently break the magical will of a worshipper of money by taking his money a
way from him, or by destroying its value in some way or another.  But, in the c
ase of money, general experience tells us that there is very little of it lying
 about loose.  In this case, above all, {137} people have recognised its talism
anic virtue, that is to say, its power as an instrument of the will.
   But with many ikons and images, it is easy to steal their virtue.  This can
be done sometimes on a tremendous scale, as, for example, when all the images o
f Isis and Horus, or similar mother-child combinations, were appropriated whole
sale by the Christians.  The miracle is, however, of a somewhat dangerous type,
 as in this case, where enlightenment has come through the researches of archae
ologists.  It has been shown that the so-called images of Mary and Jesus are re
ally nothing but imitations of those of Isis and Horus.  Honesty is the best po
licy in Magick as in other lines of life.

                          CHAPTER XVII

                     OF THE LICENSE TO DEPART


   After a ceremony has reached its climax, anti-climax must inevitably follow.
  But if the ceremony has been successful this anti-climax is merely formal.  T
he Magician should rest permanently on the higher plain to which he has aspired
.>  The whole force of the operation should be absorbed; but there is almost ce
rtain to be a residuum, since no operation is perfect: and (even if it were so)
 there would be a number of things, sympathetic to the operation, attracted to
the Circle.  These must be duly dispersed, or they will degenerate and become e
vil.  It is always easy to do this where invocations are concerned; the mere re
moval of the strain imposed by the will of the magician will restore things to
their normal aspects, in accordance with the great law of inertia.  In a badly-
managed evocation, however, this does not always obtain; the spirit may refuse
to be controlled, and may refuse to depart --- even after having sworn obedienc
e.  In such a case extreme danger may arise.
   In the ordinary way, the Magician dismisses the spirit with these words: "An
d now I say unto thee, depart in peace unto thine habitations and abodes --- an
d may the blessing of the Highest be upon thee in the name of (here mention the
 divine name suitable to the operation, or a Name appropriate to redeem that sp
irit); and let there be peace between thee and me; and be thou very ready to co
me, whensoever thou are invoked and called!">  {139}
   Should he fail to disappear immediately, it is a sign that there is somethin
g very wrong.  The Magician should immediately reconsecrate the Circle with the
 utmost care.  He should then repeat the dismissal; and if this does not suffic
e, he should then perform the banishing ritual suitable to the nature of the sp
irit and, if necessary, add conjurations to the same effect.  In these circumst
ances, or if anything else suspicious should occur, he should not be content wi
th the apparent disappearance of the spirit, who might easily make himself invi
sible and lie in ambush to do the Magician a mischief when he stepped out of th
e Circle --- or even months afterwards.
   Any symbol which has once definitely entered your environment with your own
consent is extremely dangerous; unless under absolute control.  A man's friends
 are more capable of working him harm than are strangers; and his greatest dang
er lies in his own habits.
   Of course it is the very condition of progress to build up ideas into the su
bconscious.  The necessity of selection should therefore be obvious.
   True, there comes a time when all elements soever must be thus assimilated.
 Samadhi is, by definition, that very process.  But, from the point of view of
the young magician, there is a right way --- strait and difficult --- of perfor
ming all this.  One cannot too frequently repeat that what is lawful and proper
 to one Path is alien to another.
  Immediately after the License to Depart, and the general closing up of the wo
rk, it is necessary that the Magician should sit down and write up his magical
record.  However much he may have been tired> by the ceremony, he ought to forc
e himself to do this until it becomes a habit.  Verily, it is better to fail in
 the magical ceremony than to fail in writing down an accurate record of it.  O
ne need not doubt the propriety of this remark.  Even if one is eaten alive by
Malkah be-Tarshishim ve-Ruachoth ha-Schehalim, it does not matter very much, fo
r it is over so very quickly.  But the record of the transactions is {140} othe
rwise important.  Nobody cares about Duncan having been murdered by Macbeth.  I
t is only one of a number of similar murders.  But Shakespeare's account of the
 incident is a unique treasure of mankind.  And, apart from the question of the
 value to others, there is that of the value to the magician himself.  The reco
rd of the magician is his best asset.
   It is as foolish to do Magick without method, as if it were anything else.
To do Magick without keeping a record is like trying to run a business without
book-keeping.  There are a great many people who quite misunderstand the nature
 of Magick.  They have an idea that it is something vague and unreal, instead o
f being, as it is, a direct means of coming into contact with reality.  It is t
hese people who pay themselves with phrases, who are always using long words wi
th no definite connotation, who plaster themselves with pompous titles and deco
rations which mean nothing whatever.  With such people we have nothing to do.
But to those who seek reality the Key of Magick is offered, and they are hereby
 warned that the key to the treasure-house is no good without the combination;
and the combination is the magical record.
   From one point of view, magical progress actually consists in deciphering on
e's own record.>  For this reason it is the most important thing to do, on stri
ctly magical grounds.  But apart from this, it is absolutely essential that the
 record should be clear, full and concise, because it is only by such a record
that your teacher can judge how it is best to help you.  Your magical teacher h
as something else to do besides running around after you all the time, and the
most important of all his functions is that of auditor.  Now, if you call in an
 auditor to investigate a business, and when he asks for the books you tell him
 that you have not thought it worth while to keep any, you need not be surprise
d if he thinks you every kind of an ass.
   It is --- at least, it was --- perfectly incredible to THE MASTER THERION th
at people who exhibit ordinary common sense in {141} the other affairs of life
should lose it completely when they tackle Magick.  It goes far to justify the
belief of the semi-educated that Magick is rather a crazy affair after all.  Ho
wever, there are none of these half-baked lunatics connected with the A.'. A.'.
, because the necessity for hard work, for passing examinations at stated inter
vals, and for keeping an intelligible account of what they are doing, frightens
 away the unintelligent, idle and hysterical.
   There are numerous models of magical and mystical records to be found in the
 various numbers of the "Equinox", and the student will have no difficulty in a
cquiring the necessary technique, if he be diligent in practice.

                           CHAPTER XVIII

              OF CLAIRVOYANCE AND THE BODY OF LIGHT
                   ITS POWER AND ITS DEVELOPMENT
                    ALSO CONCERNING DIVINATION

                                 I

 Within the human body is another body of approximately the same size and shape
;> but made of a subtler and less illusory material.  It is of course not "real
"; but then no more is the other body!  Before treating of clairvoyance one mus
t discuss briefly this question of reality, for misapprehension on the subject
has given rise to endless trouble.
   There is the story of the American in the train who saw another American car
rying a basket of unusual shape.  His curiosity mastered him, and he leant acro
ss and said:  "Say, stranger, what you got in that bag?"  The other, lantern-ja
wed and taciturn, replied: "mongoose".  The first man was rather baffled, as he
 had never heard of a mongoose.  After a pause he pursued, at the risk of a reb
uff: "But say, what is a Mongoose?"  "Mongoose eats snakes", replied the other.
  This was another poser, but he pursued: "What in hell do you want a Mongoose
for?"  "Well, you see", said the second man (in a confidential whisper) "my bro
ther sees snakes".  The first man was more puzzled than ever; but after a long
think, he continued rather pathetically: "But say, them ain't real snakes".  "S
ure", said the man with the basket, "but this Mongoose ain't real either".
   This is a perfect parable of Magick.  There is no such thing {143} as truth
in the perceptible universe; every idea when analysed is found to contain a con
tradiction.  It is quite useless (except as a temporary expedient) to set up on
e class of ideas against another as being "more real".  The advance of man towa
rds God is not necessarily an advance towards truth.  All philosophical systems
 have crumbled.  But each class of ideas possesses true relations within itself
.  It is possible, with Berkeley,> to deny the existence of water and of wood;
but, for all that, wood floats on water.  The Magician becomes identical with t
he immortal Osiris, yet the Magician dies.  In this dilemma the facts must be r
estated.  One should preferably say that the Magician becomes conscious of that
 part of himself which he calls the immortal Osiris; and that Part does not "di
e".
   Now this interior body of the Magician, of which we spoke at the beginning o
f this chapter, does exist, and can exert certain powers which his natural body
 cannot do.  It can, for example, pass through "matter", and it can move freely
 in every direction through space.  But this is because "matter", in the sense
in which we commonly use the word, is on another plane>.
   Now this fine body perceives a universe which we do not ordinarily perceive.
  It does not necessarily perceive the universe which we do normally perceive,
so although in this body I can pass through the roof, it does not follow that I
 shall be able to tell what the weather is like.  I might do so, or I might not
: but if I could not, it would not prove that I was deceiving myself in supposi
ng that I had passed through the roof.  This body, which is called by various a
uthors the Astral double, body of Light, body of fire, body of desire, fine bod
y, scin-laeca and numberless other names is naturally fitted to perceive object
s of its own class ... in particular, the phantoms of the astral plane. {144}
   There is some sort of vague and indeterminate relation between the Astrals a
nd the Materials; and it is possible, with great experience, to deduce facts ab
out material things from the astral aspect which they present to the eyes of th
e Body of Light.>  This astral plane is so varied and so changeable that severa
l clairvoyants looking at the same thing might give totally different accounts
of what they saw; yet they might each make correct deductions.  In looking at a
 man the first clairvoyant might say: "The lines of force are all drooping"; th
e second: "It seems all dirty and spotty"; a third; "The Aura looks very ragged
." Yet all might agree in deducing that the man was in ill-health.  In any case
 all such deductions are rather unreliable.  One must be a highly skilled man b
efore one can trust one's vision.  A great many people think that they are extr
emely good at the business, when in fact they have only made some occasional sh
rewd guesses (which they naturally remember) in the course of hundreds of forgo
tten failures.
   The only way to test clairvoyance is to keep a careful record of every exper
iment made.  For example, FRATER O. M. once gave a clairvoyant a waistcoat to p
sychometrize.  He made 56 statements about the owner of the waistcoat; of these
 4 were notably right; 17, though correct, were of that class of statement whic
h is true of almost everybody.  The remainder were wrong.  It was concluded fro
m this that he showed no evidence of any special power.  In fact, his bodily ey
es, --- if he could discern Tailoring --- would have served him better, for he
thought the owner of the vest was a corn-chandler, instead of an earl, as he is
.
   The Magician can hardly take too much trouble to develop this power in himse
lf.  It is extremely useful to him in guarding himself against attack; in obtai
ning warnings, in judging character, and especially in watching the process of
his Ceremonies.  {145}
   There are a great many ways of acquiring the power.  Gaze into a crystal, or
 into a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, or into a mirror, or into a teacup
.  Just as with a microscope the expert operator keeps both eyes open, though s
eeing only through the one at the eye-piece of the instrument, so the natural e
yes, ceasing to give any message to the brain, the attention is withdrawn from
them, and the man begins to see through the Astral eyes.
   These methods appear to The MASTER THERION to be unsatisfactory.  Very often
 they do not work at all.  It is difficult to teach a person to use these metho
ds; and, worst of all, they are purely passive!  You can see only what is shewn
 you, and you are probably shewn things perfectly pointless and irrelevant.
 The proper method is as follows: --- Develop the body of Light until it is jus
t as real to you as your other body, teach it to travel to any desired symbol,
and enable it to perform all necessary Rites and Invocations.  In short, educat
e it.  Ultimately, the relation of that body with your own must be exceedingly
intimate; but before this harmonizing takes place, you should begin by a carefu
l differentiation.  The first thing to do, therefore, is to get the body outsid
e your own.  To avoid muddling the two, you begin by imagining a shape resembli
ng yourself standing in front of you.  Do not say: "Oh, it's only imagination!"
  The time to test that is later on, when you have secured a fairly clear menta
l image of such a body.  Try to imagine how your own body would look if you wer
e standing in its place; try to transfer your consciousness to the Body of Ligh
t.  Your own body has its eyes shut.  Use the eyes of the Body of Light to desc
ribe the objects in the room behind you.  Don't say. "It's only an effort of su
bconscious memory" ... the time to test that is later on.
   As soon as you feel more or less at home in the fine body, let it rise in th
e air.  Keep on feeling the sense of rising; keep on looking about you as you r
ise until you see landscapes or beings of the astral plane.  Such have a qualit
y all their own.  They are not like material things --- they are not like menta
l pictures --- they seem to lie between the two.
   After some practice has made you adept, so that in the course {146} of any h
our's journey you can reckon on having a fairly eventful time, turn your attent
ion to reaching a definite place on the astral plane; invoke Mercury, for examp
le, and examine carefully your record of the resulting vision --- discover whet
her the symbols which you have seen correspond with the conventional symbols of
 Mercury.
   This testing of the spirits is the most important branch of the whole tree o
f Magick.  Without it, one is lost in the jungle of delusion.  Every spirit, up
 to God himself, is ready to deceive you if possible, to make himself out more
important than he is; in short to lay in wait for your soul in 333 separate way
s.  Remember that after all the highest of all the Gods is only the Magus,> May
an, the greatest of all the devils.
   You may also try "rising on the planes".>  With a little practice, especiall
y if you have a good Guru, you ought to be able to slip in and out of your astr
al body as easily as you slip in and out of a dressing-gown.  It will then no l
onger be so necessary for your astral body to be sent far off; without moving a
n inch you will be able to "turn on" its eyes and ears --- as simply as the man
 with the microscope (mentioned above) can transfer his complete attention from
 one eye to the other.
 Now, however unsuccessful your getting out the body may apparently have been,
it is most necessary to use every effort to bring it properly back.  Make the B
ody of Light coincide in space with the physical body, assume the God-Form, and
 vibrate the name of Harpocrates with the utmost energy; then recover unity of
consciousness.  If you fail to do this properly you may find yourself in seriou
s trouble.  Your Body of Light may wander away uncontrolled, and be attacked an
d obsessed.  You will become aware of this through the occurrence of headache,
bad dreams, or even more serious signs such as hysteria, fainting fits, possibl
y madness or paralysis.  Even the worst of these attacks will probably wear off
, but it may leave you permanently damaged to a greater or less extent.  {147}
   A great majority of "spiritualists", "occultists", "Toshosophists", are piti
able examples of repeated losses from this cause.
   The emotional type of religionist also suffers in this way.  Devotion projec
ts the fine body, which is seized and vampirized by the demon masquerading as "
Christ" or "Mary", or whoever may be the object of worship.  Complete absence o
f all power to concentrate thought, to follow an argument, to formulate a Will,
 to hold fast to an opinion or a course of action, or even to keep a solemn oat
h, mark indelibly those who have thus lost parts of their souls.  They wander f
rom one new cult to another even crazier.  Occasionally such persons drift for
a moment into the surrounding of The MASTER THERION, and are shot out by the si
mple process of making them try to do a half-hour's honest work of any kind.
   In projecting the Astral, it is a valuable additional safeguard to perform t
he whole operation in a properly consecrated circle.
 Proceed with great caution, then, but proceed.  In time your Body of Light wil
l be as strong against spirits as your other body against the winds of Heaven.
 All depends upon the development of that Body of Light.  It must be furnished
with an organism as ramified and balanced as its shadowy brother, the material
body.
   To recapitulate once more, then, the first task is to develop your own Body
of light within your own circle without reference to any other inhabitants of t
he world to which it belongs.
 That which you have accomplished with the subject you may now proceed to do wi
th the object.  You will learn to see the astral appearance of material things;
 and although this does not properly belong to pure clairvoyance, one may here
again mention that you should endeavour to the utmost to develop and fortify th
is Body of Light.  The best and simplest way to do this is to use it constantly
, to exercise it in every way.  In particular it may be employed in ceremonies
of initiation or of invocation --- while the physical body remains silent and s
till.
   In doing this it will often be necessary to create a Temple on the astral pl
ane.  It is excellent practice to create symbols.  This one precaution is neede
d: after using them, they should be reabsorbed.  {148}
   Having learned to create astral forms, the next step will be at first very d
ifficult.  Phantasmal and fleeting as the astral is in general, those forms whi
ch are definitely attached to the material possess enormous powers of resistanc
e, and it consequently requires very high potential to influence them.  The mat
erial analogues seem to serve as a fortress.  Even where a temporary effect is
produced, the inertia of matter draws it back to the normal; yet the power of t
he trained and consecrated will in a well-developed astral body is such that it
 can even produce a permanent change in the material upon whose Body of Light y
ou are working, e.g.; one can heal the sick by restoring a healthy appearance t
o their astral forms.  On the other hand, it is possible so to disintegrate the
 Body of Light even of a strong man that he will fall dead.
   Such operations demand not only power, but judgment.  Nothing can upset the
sum total of destiny --- everything must be paid for the uttermost farthing.  F
or this reason a great many operations theoretically possible cannot be perform
ed.  Suppose, for example, you see two men of similarly unhealthy astral appear
ance.  In one case the cause may be slight and temporary.  Your help suffices t
o restore him in a few minutes.  The other, who looks no worse, is really oppre
ssed by a force incalculably greater than you could control, and you would only
 damage yourself by attempting to help him.  The diagnosis between the two case
s could be made by an investigation of the deeper strata of the astral, such as
 compose the"causal body".
   A body of black magicians under Anna Kingsford> once attempted to kill a viv
isector who was not particularly well known; and they succeeded in making him s
eriously ill.  But in attempting the same thing with Pasteur they produced no e
ffect whatever, because Pasteur was a great genius --- an adept in his own line
 far greater than she in hers --- and because millions of people were daily ble
ssing him.  It cannot be too clearly understood that magical force is subject t
o the same laws of proportion as any other kind of force.  It is useless for a
mere millionaire to try to bankrupt a man who has the Bank of England behind hi
m.  {149}
   To sum up, the first task is to separate the astral form from the physical b
ody, the second to develop the powers of the astral body, in particular those o
f sight, travel, and interpretation; third, to unify the two bodies without mud
dling them.
 This being accomplished, the magician is fitted to deal with the invisible.

                              II

   It is now useful to contine with considerations of other planes, which have
commonly been classed under the Astral.  There is some reason for this, as the
delimitations are somewhat vague.  Just as the vegetable kingdom merges into th
e animal, and as the material plane has beings which encroach upon the boundari
es of the astral, so do we find it in the higher planes.
   The mental images which appear during meditation are subjective, and pertain
 not at all to the astral plane.  Only very rarely do astral images occur durin
g meditation.  It is a bad break in the circle, as a rule, when they do.
   There is also a Magical Plane.  This touches the material, and even includes
 a portion of it.  It includes the Astral, chiefly a full-blooded type of the A
stral.  It reaches to and includes most, if not all, of the spiritual planes.
   The Magical plane is thus the most comprehensive of all.  Egyptian Gods are
typical inhabitants of this plane, and it is the home of every Adept.
   The spiritual planes are of several types, but are all distinguished by a re
ality and intensity to be found nowhere else.  Their inhabitants are formless,
free of space and time, and distinguished by incomparable brilliance.
   There are also a number of sub-planes, as, for example, the Alchemical.  Thi
s plane will often appear in the practice of "Rising on the Planes"; its images
 are usually those of gardens curiously kept, mountains furnished with peculiar
 symbols, hieroglyphic animals, or such figures as that of the "Hermetic Arcanu
m", and pictures like the "Goldseekers" and the "Massacre of the Innocents" of
Basil Valentine.  There is a unique quality about the alchemical Plane which re
nders its images immediately recognizable.  {150}
   There are also planes corresponding to various religions past and present, a
ll of which have their peculiar unity.
   It is of the utmost importance to the "Clairvoyant" or "traveler in the fine
 body" to be able to find his way to any desired plane, and operate therein as
its ruler.
   The Neophyte of A.'. A.'. is examined most strictly in this practice before
he is passed to the degree of Zelator.
   In "Rising on the Planes" one must usually pass clear through the Astral to
the Spiritual.  Some will be unable to do this.  The "fine body" which is good
enough to subsist on lower planes, a shadow among shadows, will fail to penetra
te the higher strata.  It requires a great development of this body, and an int
ense infusion of the highest spiritual constituents of man, before he can pierc
e the veils.  The constant practice of Magick is the best preparation possible.
  Even though the human consciousness fail to reach the goal, the consciousness
 of the fine body itself may do so, wherefore whoso travels in that body on a s
ubsequent occasion may be found worthy; and its success will react favourably o
n the human consciousness, and increase its likelihood of success in its next m
agical operation.
   Similarly, the powers gained in this way will strengthen the magician in his
 mediation-practices.  His Will becomes better able to assist the concentration
, to destroy the mental images which disturb it, and to reject the lesser rewar
ds of that practice which tempt, and too often stop the progress of, the mystic
.
   Although it is said that the spiritual lies "beyond the astral", this is the
oretical;> the advanced Magician will not find it to be so in practice.  He wil
l be able by suitable invocation to travel directly to any place desired.  In L
iber 418 an example of perfection is given.  The Adept who explored these Aethy
rs did not have to pass through and beyond the Universe, the whole of which yet
 lies within even the inmost (30th) Aethyr.  He was able to summon the Aethyrs
he wanted, and His chief difficulty was that sometimes {151} He was at first un
able to pierce their veils.  In fact, as the Book shows, it was only by virtue
of successive and most exalted initiations undergone in the Aethyrs themselves
that He was able to penetrate beyond the 15th.  The Guardians of such fortresse
s know how to guard.
   The MASTER THERION has published the most important practical magical secret
s in the plainest language.  No one, by virtue of being clever or learned, has
understood one word; and those unworthy who have profaned the sacrament have bu
t eaten and drunken damnation to themselves.
   One may bring down stolen fire in a hollow tube from Heaven, as The MASTER T
HERION indeed has done in a way that no other adept dared to do before him.  Bu
t the thief, the Titan, must foreknow and consent to his doom to be chained upo
n a lonely rock, the vulture devouring his liver, for a season, until Hercules,
 the strong man armed by virtue of that very fire, shall come and release him.
   The TEITAN> --- whose number is the number of a man, six hundred and three s
core and six --- unsubdued, consoled by Asia and Panthea, must send forth const
ant showers of blessing not only upon Man whose incarnation he is, but upon the
 tyrant and the persecutor.  His infinite pain must thrill his heart with joy,
since every pang is but the echo of some new flame that leaps upon the earth li
t by his crime.
   For the Gods are the enemies of Man; it is Nature that Man must overcome ere
 he enter into his kingdom.>  The true God {152} is man.  In man are all things
 hidden.  Of these the Gods, Nature, Time, all the powers of the universe are r
ebellious slaves.  It is these that men must fight and conquer in the power and
 in the name of the Beast that hath availed them, the Titan, the Magus, the Man
 whose number is six hundred and three score and six.

                               III

   The practice of Rising on the Planes is of such importance that special atte
ntion must be paid to it.  It is part of the essential technique of Magick.  In
struction in this practice has been given with such conciseness in Liber O, tha
t one cannot do better than quote verbatim (the "previous experiment" referred
to in the first sentence is the ordinary astral journey.):
   "1.  The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of i
mportance.  But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form of
Dharana --- concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest ends.  T
he principal use of the practice in {153} the last chapter is to familiarise th
e student with every kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he ma
y be perfect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, t
o transmute it, to cause it instantly to obey his will.
   "2.  Let him then begin exactly as before; but with the most intense solemni
ty and determination.
   "3.  Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a line e
xactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical bod
y is situated (or, to put it more simply, straight upwards).
   "4.  Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost over
comes him.  If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and
 that figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.  Yea, though his ve
ry life tremble on his lips, let him force his way upward and onward!
   "5.  Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.  What
ever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his hosts loose
d from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very Throne of
God himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let him strugg
le on, ever on.
   "6.  At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed up i
n fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.  Let him sink (when no longer can he
 strive, though his tongue be bitten through with the effort and the blood gush
 from his nostrils) into the blackness of unconsciousness; and then on coming t
o himself, let him write down soberly and accurately a record of all that hath
occurred: yea, a record of all that hath occurred."

   Of course, the Rising may be done from any starting pint.  One can go (for e
xample) into the circle of Jupiter, and the results, especially in the lower pl
anes, will be very different to those obtained from a Saturnian starting point.
   The student should undertake a regular series of such experiments, in order
to familiarise himself not only with the nature of the different spheres, but w
ith the inner meaning of each.  Of course, it is not necessary in every case to
 push the {154} practice to exhaustion, as described in the instructions, but t
his is the proper thing to do whenever definitely practising, in order to acqui
re the power of Rising.  But, having obtained this power, it is, of course, leg
itimate to rise to any particular plane that may be necessary for the purpose o
f exploration, as in the case of the visions recorded in Liber 418, where the m
ethod may be described as mixed.  In such a case, it is not enough to invoke th
e place you wish to visit, because you may not be able to endure its pressure,
or to breathe its atmosphere.  Several instances occur in that record where the
 seer was unable to pass through certain gateways, or to remain in certain cont
emplations.  He had to undergo certain Initiations before he was able to procee
d.  Thus, it is necessary that the technique of Magick should be perfected.  Th
e Body of Light must be rendered capable of going everywhere and doing everythi
ng.  It is, therefore, always the question of drill which is of importance.  Yo
u have got to go out Rising on the Planes every day of your life, year after ye
ar.  You are not to be disheartened by failure, or too much encouraged by succe
ss, in any one practice or set of practices.  What you are doing is what will b
e of real value to you in the end; and that is, developing a character, creatin
g a Karma, which will give you the power to do your will.

                              IV

   Divination is so important a branch of Magick as almost to demand a separate
 treatise.
 Genius is composed of two sides; the active and the passive.  The power to exe
cute the Will is but blind force unless the Will be enlightened.  At every stag
e of a Magical Operation it is necessary to know what one is doing, and to be s
ure that one is acting wisely.  Acute sensitiveness is always associated with g
enius; the power to perceive the universe accurately, to analyse, coordinate, a
nd judge impressions is the foundation of all great Work.  An army is but a blu
ndering brute unless its intelligence department works as it should.
   The Magician obtains the transcendental knowledge necessary to an intelligen
t course of conduct directly in consciousness by clairvoyance and clairaudience
; but communication with superior {155} intelligences demands elaborate prepara
tion, even after years of successful performance.
   It is therefore useful to possess an art by which one can obtain at a moment
's notice any information that may be necessary.  This art is divination.  The
answers to one's questions in divination are not conveyed directly but through
the medium of a suitable series of symbols.  These symbols must be interpreted
by the diviner in terms of his problem.  It is not practicable to construct a l
exicon in which the solution of every difficulty is given in so many words.  It
 would be unwieldy; besides, nature does not happen to work on those lines.
   The theory of any process of divination may be stated in a few simple terms.
   1. We postulate the existence of intelligences, either within or without the
 diviner, of which he is not immediately conscious. (It does not matter to the
theory whether the communicating spirit so-called is an objective entity or a c
oncealed portion of the diviner's mind.)  We assume that such intelligences are
 able to reply correctly --- within limits --- to the questions asked.
   2. We postulate that it is possible to construct a compendium of hieroglyphs
 sufficiently elastic in meaning to include every possible idea, and that one o
r more of these may always be taken to represent any idea.  We assume that any
of these hieroglyphics will be understood by the intelligences with whom we wis
h to communicate in the same sense as it is by ourselves.  We have therefore a
sort of language.  One may compare it to a "lingua franca" which is perhaps def
ective in expressing fine shades of meaning, and so is unsuitable for literatur
e, but which yet serves for the conduct of daily affairs in places where many t
ongues are spoken.  Hindustani is an example of this.  But better still is the
analogy between the conventional signs and symbols employed by mathematicians,
who can thus convey their ideas perfectly> without speaking a word of each othe
r's languages.  {156}
   3. We postulate that the intelligences whom wish to consul are willing, or m
ay be compelled, to answer us truthfully.
   Let us first consider the question of the compendium of symbols.  The alphab
et of a language is a more or less arbitrary way of transcribing the sounds emp
loyed in speaking it.  The letters themselves have not necessarily any meaning
as such.  But in a system of divination each symbol stands for a definite idea.
  It would not interfere with the English language to add a few new letters.  I
n fact, some systems of shorthand have done so.  But a system of symbols suitab
le for divination must be a complete representation of the Universe, so that ea
ch is absolute, and the whole insusceptible to increase or diminution.  It is (
in fact) technically a pantacle in the fullest sense of the word.
   Let us consider some prominent examples of such system.  We may observe that
 a common mode of divination is to inquire of books by placing the thumb at ran
dom within the leaves.  The Books of the Sybil, the works of Vergil, and the Bi
ble have been used very frequently for this purpose.  For theoretical justifica
tion, one must assume that the book employed is a perfect representation of the
 Universe.  But even if this were the case, it is an inferior form of construct
ion, because the only reasonable conception of the Cosmos is mathematical and h
ieroglyphic rather than literary.  In the case of a book, such as the Book of t
he Law which is the supreme truth and the perfect rule of life, it is not repug
nant to good sense to derive an oracle from its pages.  It will of course be re
marked that the Book of the Law is not merely a literary compilation but a comp
lex mathematical structure.  It therefore fulfils the required conditions.
   The principal means of divination in history are astrology, geomancy, the Ta
rot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King.  There are hundreds of others; from pyr
omancy, oneiromancy, auguries from sacrifices, and the spinning-top of some anc
ient oracles to the omens drawn from the flight of birds and the prophesying of
 tea-leaves.  It will be sufficient for our present purpose to discuss only the
 five systems first enumerated.
   ASTROLOGY is theoretically a perfect method, since the symbols employed actu
ally exist in the macrocosm, and thus possess a {157} natural correspondence wi
th microcosmic affairs.  But in practice the calculations involved are overwhel
mingly complicated.  A horoscope is never complete.  It needs to be supplemente
d by innumerable other horoscopes.  For example, to obtain a judgment on the si
mplest question, one requires not only the nativities of the people involved, s
ome of which are probably inaccessible, but secondary figures for directions an
d transits, together with progressed horoscopes, to say nothing of prenatal, mu
ndane, and even horary figures.  To appreciate the entire mass of data, to bala
nce the elements of so vast a concourse of forces, and to draw a single judgmen
t therefrom, is a task practically beyond human capacity.  Besides all this, th
e actual effects of the planetary positions and aspects are still almost entire
ly unknown.  No two astrologers agree on all points; and most of them are at od
ds on fundamental principles.>  This science had better be discarded unless the
 student chances to feel strongly drawn toward it.  It is used by the MASTER TH
ERION Himself with fairly satisfactory results, but only in special cases, in a
 strictly limited sphere, and with particular precautions.  Even so, He feels g
reat diffidence in basing His conduct on the result so obtained.
   GEOMANCY has the advantage of being rigorously mathematical.  A hand-book of
 the science is to be found in Equinox I, II.  The objection to its use lies in
 the limited number of the symbols.  To represent the Universe by no more than
16 combinations throws too much work upon them.  There is also a great restrict
ion arising from the fact that although 15 symbols appear in the final figure,
there are, in reality, but 4, the remaining 11 being drawn by an ineluctable pr
ocess from the "Mothers".  It may be added that the tables given in the handboo
k for the interpretation of the figure are exceedingly vague on the one hand, a
nd insufficiently comprehensive on the other.  Some Adepts, however, appear to
find this system admirable, and obtain great satisfaction from its use.  Once m
ore, the personal equation must be allowed full weight.  At one time the MASTER
 THERION employed it extensively; but He was never wholly at ease with it; He f
ound the {158} interpretation very difficult.  Moreover, it seemed to Him that
the geomantic intelligences themselves were of a low order, the scope of which
was confined to a small section of the things which interested Him; also, they
possessed a point of view of their own which was far from sympathetic with His,
 so that misunderstanding constantly interfered with the Work.
 THE TAROT and THE HOLY QABALAH may be discussed together.  The theoretical bas
is of both is identical: The Tree of Life.> The 78 symbols of the Tarot are adm
irably balanced and combined.  They are adequate to all demands made upon them;
 each symbol is not only mathematically precise, but possesses an artistic sign
ificance which helps the diviner to understand them by stimulating his aestheti
c perceptions.  The MASTER THERION finds that the Tarot is infallible in materi
al questions.  The successive operations describe the course of events with ast
onishing wealth of detail, and the judgments are reliable in all respects.  But
 a proper divination means at least two hours' hard work, even by the improved
method developed by Him from the traditions of initiates.  Any attempt to short
en the proceedings leads to disappointment; furthermore, the symbols do not len
d themselves readily to the solution of spiritual questions.
   The Holy Qabalah, based as it is on pure number, evidently possesses an infi
nite number of symbols.  Its scope is conterminous with existence itself; and i
t lacks nothing in precision, purity, or indeed in any other perfection.  But i
t cannot be taught;> each man must select for himself the materials for the mai
n structure of his system.  It requires years of work to erect a worthy buildin
g.  Such a building is never finished; every day spent on it adds new ornaments
.  The Qabalah is therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost.  It is the man h
imself and his universe expressed in terms of thought whose {159} language is s
o rich that even the letters of its alphabet have no limit.  This system is so
sublime that it is unsuited to the solution of the petty puzzles of our earthly
 existence.  In the light of the Qabalah, the shadows of transitory things are
instantly banished.
   The YI KING is the most satisfactory system for general work.  The MASTER TH
ERION is engaged in the preparation of a treatise on the subject, but the labou
r involved is so great that He cannot pledge Himself to have it ready at any de
finite time.  The student must therefore make his own investigations into the m
eaning of the 64 hexagrams as best he can.
   The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form.  Its structure is cog
nate with that of the Qabalah; the identity is so intimate that the existence o
f two such superficially different systems is transcendent testimony to the tru
th of both.  It is in some ways the most perfect hieroglyph ever constructed.
It is austere and sublime, yet withal so adaptable to every possible emergency
that its figures may be interpreted to suit all classes of questions.  One may
resolve the most obscure spiritual difficulties no less than the most mundane d
ilemmas; and the symbol which opens the gates of the most exalted palaces of in
itiation is equally effective when employed to advise one in the ordinary busin
ess of life.  The MASTER THERION has found the Yi King entirely satisfactory in
 every respect.  The intelligences which direct it show no inclination to evade
 the question or to mislead the querent.  A further advantage is that the actua
l apparatus is simple.  Also the system is easy to manipulate, and five minutes
 is sufficient to obtain a fairly detailed answer to any but the most obscure q
uestions.
   With regard to the intelligences whose business it is to give information to
 the diviner, their natures differ widely, and correspond more or less to the c
haracter of the medium of divination.  Thus, the geomantic intelligences are gn
omes, spirits of an earthy nature, distinguished from each other by the modific
ations due to the various planetary and zodiacal influences which pertain to th
e several symbols.  The intelligence governing Puella is not to be confused wit
h that of Venus or of Libra.  It is simply a particular terrestrial daemon whic
h partakes of those natures.  {160}
   The Tarot, on the other hand, being a book, is under Mercury, and the intell
igence of each card is fundamentally Mercurial.  Such symbols are therefore pec
uliarly proper to communicate thought.  They are not gross, like the geomantic
daemons; but, as against this, they are unscrupulous in deceiving the diviner.>
   The Yi King is served by beings free from these defects.  The intense purity
 of the symbols prevent them from being usurped by intelligences with an axe of
 their own to grind.>
   It is always essential for the diviner to obtain absolute magical control ov
er the intelligences of the system which he adopts.  He must not leave the smal
lest loop-hole for being tricked, befogged, or mocked.  He must not allow them
to use casuistry in the interpretation of his questions.  It is a common knaver
y, especially in geomancy, to render an answer which is literally true, and yet
 deceives.  For instance, one might ask whether some business transaction would
 be profitable, and find, after getting an affirmative answer, that it really r
eferred to the other party to the affair!
   There is, on the surface, no difficulty at all in getting replies.  In fact,
 the process is mechanical; success is therefore assured, bar a stroke of apopl
exy.  But, even suppose we are safe from deceit, how can we know that the quest
ion has really been put to another mind, understood rightly, and answered from
knowledge?  It is obviously possible to check one's operations by clairvoyance,
 but this is rather like buying a safe to keep a brick in.  Experience is the o
nly teacher.  One acquires what one may almost call a new sense.  One feels in
one's self whether one is right or not.  The diviner must develop this sense.
It resembles the exquisite sensibility of touch which is found in the great bil
liard player whose fingers can estimate infinitesimal degrees of force, {161} o
r the similar phenomenon in the professional taster of tea or wine who can dist
inguish fantastically subtle differences of flavour.
 It is a hard saying; but in the order to divine without error, one ought to be
 a Master of the Temple.  Divination affords excellent practice for those who a
spire to that exalted eminence, for the faintest breath of personal preference
will deflect the needle from the pole of truth in the answer.  Unless the divin
er have banished utterly from his mind the minutest atom of interest in the ans
wer to his question, he is almost certain to influence that answer in favour of
 his personal inclinations.
   The psycho-analyst will recall the fact that dreams are phantasmal represent
ations of the unconscious Will of the sleeper, and that not only are they image
s of that Will instead of representations of objective truth, but the image its
elf is confused by a thousand cross-currents set in motion by the various compl
exes and inhibitions of his character.  If therefore one consults the oracle, o
ne must take sure that one is not consciously or unconsciously bringing pressur
e to bear upon it.  It is just as when an Englishman cross-examines a Hindu, th
e ultimate answer will be what the Hindu imagines will best please the inquirer
.
   The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a perfectly
true reply, but insists on interpreting it so as to suit one's desires.  The va
st majority of people who go to "fortunetellers" have nothing else in mind but
the wish to obtain supernatural sanction for their follies.  Apart from Occulti
sm altogether, every one knows that when people ask for advice, they only want
to be told how wise they are.  Hardly any one acts on the most obviously common
sense counsel if it happens to clash with his previous intentions.  Indeed, who
 would take counsel unless he were warned by some little whisper in his heart t
hat he was about to make a fool of himself, which he is determined to do, and o
nly wants to be able to blame his best friend, or the oracle, when he is overta
ken by the disaster which his own interior mentor foresees?
   Those who embark on divination will be wise to consider the foregoing remark
s very deeply.  They will know when they are getting deep enough by the fact of
 the thought beginning to hurt them.  It is essential to explore oneself to the
 utmost, to analyse {162} one's mind until one can be positive, beyond the poss
ibility of error, that one is able to detach oneself entirely from the question
.  The oracle is a judge; it must be beyond bribery and prejudice.
   It is impossible in practice to lay down rules for the interpretation of sym
bols.  Their nature must be investigated by intellectual methods such as the Qa
balah, but the precise shape of meaning in any one case, and the sphere and ten
dency of its application, must be acquired by experience, that is, but inductio
n, by recording and classifying one's experiments over a long period; and --- t
his is the better part --- by refining one's ratiocination to the point where i
t becomes instinct or intuition, whichever one likes to call it.
   It is proper in cases where the sphere of the question is well marked to beg
in the divination by invocations of the forces thereto appropriate.  An error o
f judgment as to the true character of the question would entail penalties prop
ortionate to the extent of that error; and the delusions resulting from a divin
ation fortified by invocation would be more serious than if one had not employe
d such heavy artillery.>
   There can, however, be no objection to preparing oneself by a general purifi
cation and consecration devised with the object of detaching oneself from one's
 personality and increasing the sensitiveness of one's faculties.
   All divination comes under the general type of the element Air.  The peculia
r properties of air are in consequence its uniform characteristics.  Divination
 is subtle and intangible.  It moves with mysterious ease, expanding, contracti
ng, flowing, responsive to the slightest stress.  It receives and transmits eve
ry vibration without retaining any.  It becomes poisonous when its oxygen is de
filed by passing through human lungs.
 There is a peculiar frame of mind necessary to successful divination.  The con
ditions of the problem are difficult.  It is obviously necessary for the mind o
f the diviner to be concentrated absolutely upon his question.  Any intrusive t
hought will confuse the oracle as certainly as the reader of a newspaper is con
fused {163} when he reads a paragraph into which a few lines have strayed from
another column.  It is equally necessary that the muscles with which he manipul
ates the apparatus of divination must be entirely independent of any volition o
f his.  He must lend them for the moment to the intelligence whom he is consult
ing, to be guided in their movement to make the necessary mechanical actions wh
ich determine the physical factor of the operation.  It will be obvious that th
is is somewhat awkward for the diviner who is also a magician, for as a magicia
n he has been constantly at work to keep all his forces under his own control,
and to prevent the slightest interference with them by any alien Will.  It is,
in fact, commonly the case, or so says the experience of The MASTER THERION, th
at the most promising Magicians are the most deplorable diviners, and vice vers
a.  It is only when the aspirant approaches perfection that he becomes able to
reconcile these two apparently opposing faculties.  Indeed, there is no surer s
ign of all-round success than this ability to put the whole of one's powers at
the service of any type of task.
   With regard to the mind, again, it would seem that concentration on the ques
tion makes more difficult the necessary detachment from it.  Once again, the di
viner stands in need of a considerable degree of attainment in the practices of
 meditation.  He must have succeeded in destroying the tendency of the ego to i
nterfere with the object of thought.  He must be able to conceive of a thing ou
t of all relation with anything else.  The regular practice of concentration le
ads to this result; in fact, it destroys the thing itself as we have hitherto c
onceived it; for the nature of things is always veiled from us by our habit of
regarding them as in essential relation without ourselves and our reactions tow
ard them.
 One can hardly expect the diviner to make Samadhi with his question --- that w
ould be going too far, and destroy the character of the operation by removing t
he question from the class of concatenated ideas.  It would mean interpreting t
he question in terms of "without limit", and this imply an equally formless ans
wer.  But he should approximate to this extreme sufficiently to allow the quest
ion entire freedom to make for itself its own proper links with the intelligenc
e directing the answer, {164} preserving its position on its own plane, and evo
king the necessary counterpoise to its own deviation from the norm of nothingne
ss.
   We may recapitulate the above reflections in a practical form.  We will supp
ose that one wishes to divine by geomancy whether or no one should marry, it be
ing assumed that one's emotional impulses suggest so rash a course.  The man ta
kes his wand and his sand; the traces the question, makes the appropriate penta
gram, and the sigil of the spirit.  Before tracing the dashes which are to dete
rmine the four "Mothers", he must strictly examine himself.  He must banish fro
m his mind every thought which can possibly act as an attachment to his propose
d partner.  He must banish all thoughts which concern himself, those of apprehe
nsion no less than those of ardour.  He must carry his introspection as far as
possible.  He must observe with all the subtlety at his command whether it pain
s him to abandon any of these thoughts.  So long as his mind is stirred, howeve
r slightly, by one single aspect of the subject, he is not fit to begin to form
 the figure.  He must sink his personality in that of the intelligence hearing
the question propounded by a stranger to whom he is indifferent, but whom it is
 his business to serve faithfully.  He must now run over the whole affair in hi
s mind, making sure of this utter aloofness therefrom.  He must also make sure
that his muscles are perfectly free to respond to the touch of the Will of that
 intelligence.  (It is of course understood that he has not become so familiar
with geomancy by dint of practice as to be able to calculate subconsciously wha
t figures he will form; for this would vitiate the experiment entirely.  It is,
 in fact, one of the objections to geomancy that sooner or later one does becom
e aware at the time of tracing them whether the dots are going to be even or od
d.  This needs a special training to correct).
   Physio-psychological theory will probably maintain that the "automatic" acti
on of the hand is controlled by the brain no less than in the case of conscious
 volition; but this is an additional argument for identifying the brain with th
e intelligence invoked.
   Having thus identified himself as closely as possible with that intelligence
, and concentrated on the question as if the "prophesying spirit" were giving i
ts whole attention thereto, he must {165} await the impulse to trace the marks
on the sand; and, as soon as it comes let it race to the finish.  Here arises a
nother technical difficulty.  One has to make 16 rows of dots; and, especially
for the beginner, the mind has to grapple with the apprehension lest the hand f
ail to execute the required number.  It is also troubled by fearing to exceed;
but excess does not matter.  Extra lines are simply null and void, so that the
best plan is to banish that thought, and make sure only of not stopping too soo
n.>
   The lines being traced, the operation is over as far as spiritual qualities
are required, for a time.  The process of setting up the figure for judgment is
 purely mechanical.
   But, in the judgment, the diviner stands once more in need of his inmost and
 utmost attainments.  He should exhaust the intellectual sources of information
 at his disposal, and form from them his judgment.  But having done this, he sh
ould detach his mind from what it has just formulated, and proceed to concentra
te it on the figure as a whole, almost as if it were the object of his meditati
on.  One need hardly repeat that in both these operations detachment from one's
 personal partialities is as necessary as it was in the first part of the work.
  In setting up the figure, bias would beget a Freudian phantasm to replace the
 image of truth which the figure ought to be; and it is not too much to say tha
t the entire subconscious machinery of the body and mind lends itself with horr
id willingness to this ape-like antic of treason.  But now that the figure stan
ds for judgment, the same bias would tend to form its phantasm of wish-fulfilme
nt in a different manner.  It would act through the mind to bewray sound judgme
nt.  It might, for example, induce one to emphasize the Venereal element in Pue
lla at the expense of the Saturnian.  It might lead one to underrate the influe
nce of a hostile figure, or to neglect altogether some element of importance.
The MASTER THERION has known cases where the diver was so afraid of an unfavour
able answer that he made actual mistakes in the simple mechanical construction
of the figure!  Finally, in the {166} summing up; it is fatally easy to slur ov
er unpleasantness, and to breathe on the tiniest spark that promises to kindle
the tinder --- the rotten rags! --- of hope.
   The concluding operation is therefore to obtain a judgment of the figure, in
dependent of all intellectual or moral restraint.  One must endeavour to appreh
end it as a thing absolute in itself.  One must treat it, in short, very much t
he same as one did the question; as a mystical entity, till now unrelated with
other phenomena.  One must, so to speak, adore it as a god, uncritically: "Spea
k, Lord, for thy servant heareth."  It must be allowed to impose its intrinsic
individuality on the mind, to put its fingers independently on whatever notes i
t pleases.
   In this way one obtains an impression of the true purport of the answer; and
 one obtains it armed with a sanction superior to any sensible suggestions.  It
 comes from and to a part of the individual which is independent of the influen
ce of environment; is adjusted to that environment by true necessity, and not b
y the artifices of such adaptations as our purblind conception of convenience i
nduces us to fabricate.
   The student will observe from the above that  divination is in one sense an
art entirely separate from that of Magick; yet it interpenetrates Magick at eve
ry point.  The fundamental laws of both are identical.  The right use of divina
tion has already been explained; but it must be added that proficiency therein,
 tremendous as is its importance in furnishing the Magician with the informatio
n necessary to his strategical and tactical plans,  in no wise enables him to a
ccomplish the impossible.  It is not within the scope of divination to predict
the future (for example) with the certainty of an astronomer in calculating the
 return of a comet.>  There is always much virtue in divination; for (Shakespea
re assures us!) there is "much virtue in IF"!
   In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment, one must allow fo
r more than the numerous sources of error inherent {167} in the process itself.
  The judgment can do no more than the facts presented to it warrant.  It is na
turally impossible in most cases to make sure that some important factor has no
t been omitted.  In asking, "shall I be wise to marry?" one leaves it open for
wisdom to be defined in divers ways.  One can only expect an answer in the sens
e of the question.  The connotation of "wise" would then imply the limitations
"in your private definition of wisdom", "in reference to your present circumsta
nces."  It would not involve guarantee against subsequent disaster, or pronounc
e a philosophical dictum as to wisdom in the abstract sense.  One must not assu
me that the oracle is omniscient.  By the nature of the case, on the contrary,
it is the utterance of a being whose powers are partial and limited, though not
 to such an extent, or in the same directions, as one's own.  But a man who is
advised to purchase a certain stock should not complain if a general panic knoc
ks the bottom out of it a few weeks later.  The advice only referred to the pro
spects of the stock in itself.  The divination must not be blamed any more than
 one would blame a man for buying a house at Ypres there years before the World
-War.
 As against this, one must insist that it is obviously to the advantage of the
diviner to obtain this information from beings of the most exalted essence avai
lable.  An old witch who has a familiar spirit of merely local celebrity such a
s the toad in her tree, can hardly expect him to tell her much more of private
matters than her parish magazine does of public.  It depends entirely on the Ma
gician how he is served.  The greater the man, the greater must be his teacher.
  It follows that the highest forms of communicating daemons, those who know, s
o to speak, the court secrets, disdain to concern themselves with matters which
 they regard as beneath them.  One must not make the mistake of calling in a fa
mous physician to one's sick Pekinese.  One must also beware of asking even the
 cleverest angel a question outside his ambit.  A heart specialist should not p
rescribe for throat trouble.
   The Magician ought therefore to make himself master of several methods of di
vination; using one or the other as the purpose of the moment dictates.  He sho
uld make a point of organizing a staff of such spirits to suit various {168} oc
casions.  These should be "familiar"spirits, in the strict sense; members of hi
s family.  He should deal with them constantly, avoiding whimsical or capriciou
s changes.  He should choose them so that their capacities cover the whole grou
nd of his work; but he should not multiply them unnecessarily, for he makes him
self responsible for each one that he employs.  Such spirits should be ceremoni
ally evoked to visible or semi-visible appearance.  A strict arrangement should
 be made and sworn.  This must be kept punctiliously by the Magician, and its i
nfringement by the spirit severely punished.  Relations with these spirits shou
ld be confirmed and encouraged by frequent intercourse.  They should be treated
 with courtesy, consideration, and even affection.  They should be taught to lo
ve and respect their master, and to take pride in being trusted by him.
   It is sometimes better to act on the advice of a spirit even when one knows
it to be wrong, though in such a case one must take the proper precautions agai
nst an undesirable result.  The reason for this is that spirits of this type ar
e very sensitive.  They suffer agonies of remorse on realising that they have i
njured their Master; for he is their God; they know themselves to be part of hi
m, their aim is to attain to absorption in him.  They understand therefore that
 his interests are theirs.  Care must be taken to employ none but spirits who a
re fit for the purpose, not only by reason of their capacity to supply informat
ion, but for their sympathy with the personality of the Magician.  Any attempt
to coerce unwilling spirits is dangerous.  They obey from fear; their fear make
s them flatter, and tell amiable falsehoods.  It also creates phantasmal projec
tions of themselves to personate them; and these phantasms, besides being worth
less, become the prey of malicious daemons who use them to attack the Magician
in various ways whose prospect of success is enhanced by the fact that he has h
imself created a link with them.
   One more observation seems desirable while on this subject.  Divination of a
ny kind is improper in matters directly concerning the Great Work itself.  In t
he Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel, the adept is possesse
d of all he can possibly need.  To consult any other is to insult one's {169} A
ngel.  Moreover, it is to abandon the only person who really knows, and really
cares, in favour of one who by the nature of the case, must be ignorant> of the
 essence of the matter --- one whose interest in it is no more (at the best) th
an that of a well-meaning stranger.  It should go without saying that until the
 Magician has attained to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian A
ngel he is liable to endless deceptions.  He does not know Himself; how can he
explain his business to others?  How can those others, though they do their bes
t for him, aid in anything but trifles?  One must therefore be prepared for dis
appointment at every stage until one attains to adeptship.

   This is especially true of divination, because the essence of the horror of
not knowing one's Angel is the utter bewilderment and anguish of the mind, comp
licated by the persecution of the body, and envenomed by the ache of the soul.
 One puts the wrong questions, and puts them wrong; gets the wrong answers, jud
ges them wrong, and acts wrongly upon them.  One must nevertheless persist, asp
iring with ardour towards one's Angel, and comforted {170} by the assurance tha
t He is guiding one secretly towards Himself, and that all one's mistakes are n
ecessary preparations for the appointed hour of meeting Him.  Each mistake is t
he combing-out of some tangle in the hair of the bride as she is being coiffed
for marriage.
   On the other hand, although the adept is in daily communication with his Ang
el, he ought to be careful to consult Him only on questions proper to the digni
ty of the relation.  One should not consult one's Angel on too many details, or
 indeed on any matters which come within the office of one's familiar spirits.
 One does not go the the King about petty personal trifles.  The romance and ra
pture of the ineffable union which constitutes Adeptship must not be profaned b
y the introduction of commonplace cares.  One must not appear with one's hair i
n curl-papers, or complain of the cook's impertinence, if one wants to make the
 most of the honeymoon.>
   To the Adept divination becomes therefore a secondary consideration, althoug
h he can now employ it with absolute confidence, and probably use it with far g
reater frequency than before his attainment.  Indeed, this is likely in proport
ion as he learns that resort to divination (on every occasion when his Will doe
s not instantly instruct him) with implicit obedience to its counsels careless
as to whether or no they may land him in disaster, is a means admirably efficac
ious of keeping his mind untroubled by external impressions, and therefore in t
he proper condition to receive the reiterant strokes of rapture with which the
love of his Angel ravishes him.
   We have now mapped out the boundaries of possibility and propriety which def
ine the physical and political geography of divination.  The student must guard
 himself constantly against supposing that this art affords any absolute means
of discovering "truth", or indeed, of using that word as if it meant more than
the {171} relation of two ideas each of which is itself as subject to "change w
ithout notice" as a musical programme.
   Divination, in the nature of things, can do no more than put the mind of the
 querent into conscious connection with another mind whose knowledge of the sub
ject at issue is to his own as that of an expert to a layman.  The expert is no
t infallible.  The client may put his question in a misleading manner, or even
base it on a completely erroneous conception of the facts.  He may misunderstan
d the expert's answer, and he may misinterpret its purport.  Apart from all thi
s, excluding all error, both question and answer are limited in validity by the
ir own conditions; and these conditions are such that truth may cease to be tru
e, either as time goes on, or if it be flawed by the defect of failure to consi
der some circumstances whose concealed operation cancels the contract.
   In a word, divination, like any other science, is justified of its children.
  It would be extraordinary should so fertile a mother be immune from still-bir
ths, monstrosities, and abortions.
   We none of us dismiss our servant science with a kick and a curse every time
 the telephone gets out of order.  The telephone people make no claim that it a
lways works and always works right.>  Divination, with equal modesty, admits th
at "it often goes wrong; but it works well enough, all things considered.  The
science is in its infancy.  All we can do is our best.  We no more pretend to i
nfallibility than the mining expert who considers himself in luck if he hits th
e bull's eye four times in ten."
   The error of all dogmatists (from the oldest prophet with his "literally-ins
pired word of God" to the newest German professor with his single-track explana
tion of the Universe) lies in trying to prove too much, in defending themselves
 against critics by stretching a probably excellent theory to include all the f
acts and the fables, until it bursts like the overblown bladder it is.
   Divination is no more than a rough and ready practical method which we under
stand hardly at all, and operate only as empirics.  Success for the best divine
r alive is no more certain in any particular instance than a long putt by a cha
mpion golfer.  Its calculations {172} are infinitely more complex than Chess, a
 Chess played on an infinite board with men whose moves are indeterminate, and
made still more difficult by the interference of imponderable forces and unform
ulated laws; while its conduct demands not only the virtues, themselves rare en
ough, of intellectual and moral integrity, but intuition combining delicacy wit
h strength in such perfection and to such extremes as to make its existence app
ear monstrous and miraculous against Nature.
   To admit this is not to discredit oracles.  On the contrary, the oracles fel
l into disrepute just because they pretended to do more than they could.  To di
vine concerning a matter is little more than to calculate probabilities.  We ob
tain the use of minds who have access to knowledge beyond ours, but not to omni
science.  HRU, the great angel set over the Tarot, is beyond us as we are beyon
d the ant; but, for all we know, the knowledge of HRU is excelled by some might
ier mind in the same proportion.  Nor have we any warrant for accusing HRU of i
gnorance or error if we read the Tarot to our own delusion.  He may have known,
 he may have spoken truly; the fault may lie with our own insight.>
   The MASTER THERION has observed on innumerable occasions that divinations, m
ade by him and dismissed as giving untrue answers, have justified themselves mo
nths or years later when he was able to revise his judgment in perspective, unt
roubled by his personal passion.
   It is indeed surprising how often the most careless divinations give accurat
e answers.  When things go wrong, it is almost always possible to trace the err
or to one's own self-willed and insolent presumption in insisting that events s
hall accommodate themselves to our egoism and vanity.  It is comically unscient
ific to adduce {173} examples of the mistakes of the diviners as evidence that
their art is fatuous.  Every one knows that the simplest chemical experiments o
ften go wrong.  Every one knows the eccentricities of fountain pens; but nobody
 outside Evangelical circles makes fun of the Cavendish experiment, or asserts
that, if fountain pens undoubtedly work now and then, their doing so is merely
coincidence.
   The fact of the case is that the laws of nature are incomparably more subtle
 than even science suspects.  The phenomena of every plane are intimately inter
woven.  The arguments of Aristotle were dependent on the atmospheric pressure w
hich prevented his blood from boiling away.  There is nothing in the universe w
hich does not influence every other thing in one way or another.  There is no r
eason in Nature why the apparently chance combination of half-a dozen sticks of
 tortoise-shell should not be so linked both with the human mind and with the e
ntire structure of the Universe that the observation of their fall should not e
nable us to measure all things in heaven and earth.
   With one piece of curved glass we have discovered uncounted galaxies of suns
; with another, endless orders of existence in the infinitesimal.  With the pri
sm we have analysed light so that matter and force have become intelligible onl
y as forms of light.  With a rod we have summoned the invisible energies of ele
ctricity to be our familiar spirit serving us to do our Will, whether it be to
outsoar the condor, or to dive deeper into the demon world of disease than any
of our dreamers dared to dream.
   Since with four bits of common glass mankind has learnt to know so much, ach
ieved so much, who dare deny that the Book of Thoth, the quintessentialized wis
dom of our ancestors whose civilizations, perished though they be, have left mo
numents which dwarf ours until we wonder whether we are degenerate from them, o
r evolved from Simians, who dare deny that such a book may be possessed of unim
aginable powers?
   It is not so long since the methods of modern science were scoffed at by the
 whole cultured world.  In the sacred halls themselves the roofs rang loud with
 the scornful laughter of the high priests as each new postulant approached wit
h his unorthodox offering. {174} There is hardly a scientific discovery in hist
ory which was not decried as quackery by the very men whose own achievements we
re scarce yet recognized by the world at large.
   Within the memory of the present generation, the possibility of aeroplanes w
as derisively denied by those very engineers accounted most expert to give thei
r opinions.
   The method of divination, the "ratio" of it, is as obscure to-day as was tha
t of spectrum analysis a generation ago.  That the chemical composition of the
fixed stars should become known to man seemed an insane imagining too ridiculou
s to discuss.  To-day it seems equally irrational to enquire of the desert sand
 concerning the fate of empires.  Yet surely it, if any one knows, should know!
   To-day it may sound impossible for inanimate objects to reveal the inmost se
crets of mankind and nature.  We cannot say why divination is valid.  We cannot
 trace the process by which it performs it marvels.> But the same objections ap
ply equally well to the telephone.  No man knows what electricity is, or the na
ture of the forces which determine its action.  We know only that by doing cert
ain things we get certain results, and that the least error {175} on our part w
ill bring our work to naught.  The same is exactly true of divination.  The dif
ference between the two sciences is not more than this: that, more minds having
 been at work on the former we have learnt to master its tricks with greater su
ccess than in the case of the latter.

                        OF DRAMATIC RITUALS.

   The Wheel turns to  those effectual methods of invocation employed in the an
cient Mysteries and by certain secret bodies of initiates to-day.  The object o
f them is almost invariably> the invocation of a God, that God conceived in a m
ore or less material and personal fashion.  These Rituals are therefore well su
ited for such persons as are capable of understanding the spirit of Magick as o
pposed to the letter.  One of the great advantages of them is that a large numb
er of persons may take part, so that there is consequently more force available
; but it is important that they should all be initiates of the same mysteries,
bound by the same oaths, and filled with the same aspirations.  They should be
associated only for this one purpose.
   Such a company being prepared, the story of the God should be dramatised by
a well-skilled poet accustomed to this form of composition.  Lengthy speeches a
nd invocations should be avoided, but action should be very full.  Such ceremon
ies should be carefully rehearsed; but in rehearsals care should be taken to om
it the climax, which should be studied by the principal character in private.
The play should be so arranged that this climax depends on him alone.  By this
means one prevents the ceremony from becoming mechanical or hackneyed, and the
element of surprise. {177} assists the lesser characters to get out of themselv
es at the supreme moment.  Following the climax there should always be an unreh
earsed ceremony, an impromptu.  The most satisfactory form of this is the dance
.  In such ceremonies appropriate libations may be freely used.
   The Rite of Luna (Equinox I. VI) is a good example of this use.  Here the cl
imax is the music of the goddess, the assistants remaining in silent ecstasy.
   In the rite of Jupiter the impromptu is the dance, in that of Saturn long pe
riods of silence.
   It will be noticed that in these Rites poetry and music were largely employe
d --- mostly published pieces by well-known authors and composers.  It would be
 better> to write and compose specially for the ceremony>.

                              CHAPTER XX

                          OF THE EUCHARIST
                      AND OF THE ART OF ALCHEMY

                                   I

  One of the simplest and most complete of Magick ceremonies is the Eucharist.
   It consists in taking common things, transmuting them into things divine, an
d consuming them.
   So far, it is a type of every magick ceremony, for the reabsorption of the f
orce is a kind of consumption; but it has a more restricted application, as fol
lows.
   Take a substance> symbolic of the whole course of nature, make it God, and c
onsume it.
   There are many ways of doing this; but they may easily be classified accordi
ng to the number of the elements of which the sacrament is composed.
   The highest form of the Eucharist is that in which the Element consecrated i
s One.
   It is one substance and not two, not living and not dead, neither liquid nor
 solid, neither hot nor cold, neither male nor female.
   This sacrament is secret in every respect.  For those who may be worthy, alt
hough not officially recognized as such, this Eucharist has been described in d
etail and without concealment, "somewhere" in the published writings of the MAS
TER THERION.  But He has told no one where.  It is reserved for the highest ini
tiates, and is synonymous with the Accomplished Work on the {179} material plan
e.  It is the Medicine of Metals, the Stone of the Wise, the Potable Gold, the
Elixir of Life that is consumed therein.  The altar is the bosom of Isis, the e
ternal mother; the chalice is in effect the Cup of our Lady Babalon Herself; th
e Wand is that which Was and Is and Is To Come.
   The Eucharist of "two" elements has its matter of the passives.  The wafer (
pantacle) is of corn, typical of earth; the wine (cup) represents water.  (Ther
e are certain other attributions.  The Wafer is the Sun, for instance: and the
wine is appropriate to Bacchus).
   The wafer may, however, be more complex, the "Cake of Light" described in Li
ber Legis.
   This is used in the exoteric Mass of the Phoenix (Liber 333, Cap: 44) mixed
with the blood of the Magus.  This mass should be performed daily at sunset by
every magician.
   Corn and wine are equivalent to flesh and blood; but it is easier to convert
 live substances into the body and blood of God, than to perform this miracle u
pon dead matter.
   The Eucharist of "three" elements has for basis the symbols of the three Gun
as.  For Tamas (darkness) take opium or nightshade or some sleepy medicine; for
 Rajas (activity) take strychnine or other excitant; for Sattvas (calm) the cak
es of Light may again be suitable.>
   The Eucharist of "four" elements consists of fire, air, water, and earth.  T
hese are represented by a flame for fire, by incense or roses for air, by wine
for water, and by bread and salt for earth.
   The Eucharist of "five" has for basis wine for taste, a rose for smell, a fl
ame for sight, a bell for sound, and a dagger for touch.  This sacrament is imp
lied in the Mass of the Phoenix in a slightly different form.  {180}
   The Eucharist of "six" elements has Father, Son, and Holy Spirit above; brea
th, water, and blood beneath.  It is a sacrament reserved for high initiates.>
   The Eucharist of "seven" elements is mystically identical with that of one.
   Of the method of consecrating the elements it is only necessary to say that
they should be treated as talismans.  The circle and other furniture of the Tem
ple should receive the usual benefit of the banishings and consecrations.  The
Oath should be taken and the Invocations made.  When the divine force manifests
 in the elements, they should be solemnly consumed.  There is also a simpler me
thod of consecration reserved for initiates of high rank, of which it is here u
nlawful to speak.
 According to the nature of the Sacrament, so will its results be.  In some one
 may receive a mystic grace, culminating in Samadhi; in others a simpler and mo
re material benefit may be obtained.
   The highest sacrament, that of One element, is universal in its operation; a
ccording to the declared purpose of the work so will the result be.  It is a un
iversal Key of all Magick.
   These secrets are of supreme practical importance, and are guarded in the Sa
nctuary with a two-edged sword flaming every way>; for this sacrament is the Tr
ee of Life itself, and whoso partaketh of the fruit thereof shall never die>.
 Unless he so will.  Who would not rather work through incarnation; a real rene
wal of body and brain, than content himself with a stagnant immortality upon th
is mote in the Sunlight of the Universe which we call earth?  {181}
 With regard to the preparations for such Sacraments, the Catholic Church has m
aintained well enough the traditions of the true Gnostic Church in whose keepin
g the secrets are.>
   Chastity> is a condition; fasting for some hours previous is a condition; an
 earnest and continual aspiration is a condition.  Without these antecedents ev
en the Eucharist of the One and Seven is partially --- though such is its intri
nsic virtue that it can never be wholly --- baulked of its effect.
 A Eucharist of some sort should most assuredly be consummated daily by every m
agician, and he should regard it as the main sustenance of his magical life.  I
t is of more importance than any other magical ceremony, because it is a comple
te circle.  The whole of the force expended is completely re-absorbed; yet the
virtue is that vast gain represented by the abyss between Man and God.
   The magician becomes filled with God, fed upon God, intoxicated with God.  L
ittle by little his body will become purified by the internal lustration of God
; day by day his mortal frame, shedding its earthly elements, will become in ve
ry truth the Temple of the Holy Ghost.  Day by day matter is replaced by Spirit
, the human by the divine; ultimately the change will be complete; God manifest
 in flesh will be his name.
   This is the most important of all magical secrets that ever were or are or c
an be.  To a Magician thus renewed the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversa
tion of the Holy Guardian Angel becomes an inevitable task; every force of his
nature, unhindered, tends to that aim and goal of whose nature neither man nor
god may speak, for that it is infinitely beyond speech or thought or {182} ecst
asy or silence.  Samadhi and Nibbana are but its shadows cast upon the universe
.

                               II

   If the Master Therion effects by this book nothing else but to demonstrate t
he continuity of nature and the uniformity of Law, He will feel that His work h
as not been wasted.  In his original design of Part III he did not contemplate
any allusion to alchemy.  It has somehow been taken for granted that this subje
ct is entirely foreign to regular Magick, both in scope and method.  It will be
 the main object of the following description to establish it as essentially a
branch of the subject, and to show that it may be considered simply as a partic
ular case of the general proposition --- differing from evocatory and talismani
c Magick only in the values which are represented by the unknown quantities in
the pantomorphous equations.
   There is no need to make any systematized attempt to decipher the jargon of
Hermetic treatises.  We need not enter upon an historical discussion.  Let it s
uffice to say that the word alchemy is an Arabic term consisting of the article
 "al" and the adjective "khemi" which means "that which pertains to Egypt">.  A
 rough translation would be "The Egyptian matter".  The assumption is that the
Mohammedan grammarians held traditionally that the art was derived from that wi
sdom of the Egyptians which was the boast of Moses, Plato, and Pythagoras, and
the source of their illumination.
   Modern research (by profane scholars) leaves it still doubtful as to whether
 Alchemical treatises should be classified as mystical, magical, medical, or ch
emical.  The most reasonable opinion is that all these objects formed the pre-o
ccupation of the alchemists in varying proportions.  Hermes is alike the god of
 Wisdom, Thaumaturgy, therapeutics, and physical science.  All these may conseq
uently claim the title Hermetic.  It cannot be doubted that such writers as Flu
dd aspired to spiritual perfection.  It is equally sure that Edward Kelly wrote
 primarily from the point of view {183} of a Magician; that Paracelesus applied
 himself to the cure of disease and the prolongation of life as the first consi
deration, although his greatest achievements seem to modern thinkers to have be
en rather his discoveries of opium, zinc, and hydrogen; so that we tend to thin
k of him as a chemist no less than we do of Van Helmont, whose conception of ga
s ranks him as one of those rare geniuses who have increased human knowledge by
 a fundamentally important idea.
   The literature of Alchemy is immense.  Practically all of it is wholly or pa
rtially unintelligible.  Its treatises, from the "Asch Metzareph" of the Hebrew
s to the "Chariot of Antimony" are deliberately couched in hieratic riddles.  E
cclesiastical persecution, and the profanation of the secrets of power, were eq
ually dreaded.  Worse still, from our point of view, this motive induced writer
s to insert intentionally misleading statements, the more deeply to bedevil unw
orthy pretenders to their mysteries.
   We do not propose to discuss any of the actual processes.  Most readers will
 be already aware that the main objects of alchemy were the Philosopher's Stone
, the Medicine of Metals, and various tinctures and elixirs possessing divers v
irtues; in particular, those of healing disease, extending the span of life, in
creasing human abilities, perfecting the nature of man in every respect, confer
ring magical powers, and transmuting material substances, especially metals, in
to more valuable forms.
   The subject is further complicated by the fact that many authors were unscru
pulous quacks.  Ignorant of the first elements of the art, they plagiarized wit
hout shame, and reaped a harvest of fraudulent gain.  They took advantage of th
e general ignorance, and the convention of mystery, in just the same way as the
ir modern successors do in the matter of all Occult sciences.
   But despite all this, one thing is abundantly clear; all serious writers, th
ough they seem to speak of an infinity of different subjects, so much so that i
t has proved impossible for modern analytic research to ascertain the true natu
re of any single process, were agreed on the fundamental theory on which they b
ased their practices.  It appears at first sight as if hardly any two of them w
ere in accord as to the nature of the "First Matter of the work".  {184} They d
escribe this in a bewildering multiplicity of unintelligible symbols.  We have
no reason to suppose that they were all talking of the same thing, or otherwise
.  The same remarks apply to every reagent and every process, no less than to t
he final product or products.
   Yet beneath this diversity, we may perceive an obscure identity.  They all b
egin with a substance in nature which is described as existing almost everywher
e, and as universally esteemed of no value.  The alchemist is in all cases to t
ake this substance, and subject it to a series of operations.  By so doing, he
obtains his product.  This product, however named or described, is always a sub
stance which represents the truth or perfection of the original "First Matter";
 and its qualities are invariably such as pertain to a living being, not to an
inanimate mass.  In a word, the alchemist is to take a dead thing, impure, valu
eless, and powerless, and transform it into a live thing, active, invaluable an
d thaumaturgic.
   The reader of this book will surely find in this a most striking analogy wit
h what we have already said of the processes of Magick.  What, by our definitio
n, is initiation?  The First Matter is a man, that is to say, a perishable para
site, bred of the earth's crust, crawling irritably upon it for a span, and at
last returning to the dirt whence he sprang.  The process of initiation consist
s in removing his impurities, and finding in his true self an immortal intellig
ence to whom matter is no more than the means of manifestation.  The initiate i
s eternally individual; he is ineffable, incorruptible, immune from everything.
  He possesses infinite wisdom and infinite power in himself.  This equation is
 identical with that of a talisman.  The Magician takes an idea, purifies it, i
ntensifies it by invoking into it the inspiration of his soul.  It is no longer
 a scrawl scratched on a sheep-skin, but a word of Truth, imperishable, mighty
to prevail throughout the sphere of its purport.  The evocation of a spirit is
precisely similar in essence.  The exorcist takes dead material substances of a
 nature sympathetic to the being whom he intends to invoke.  He banishes all im
purities therefrom, prevents all interference therewith, and proceeds to give l
ife to the subtle substance thus prepared by instilling his soul.  {185}
   Once again, there is nothing in this exclusively "magical".  Rembrandt van R
yn used to take a number of ores and other crude objects.  From these he banish
ed the impurities, and consecrated them to his work, by the preparation of canv
asses, brushes, and colours.  This done, he compelled them to take the stamp of
 his soul; from those dull, valueless creatures of earth he created a vital and
 powerful being of truth and beauty.  It would indeed be surprising to anybody
who has come to a clear comprehension of nature if there were any difference in
 the essence of these various formulas.  The laws of nature apply equally in ev
ery possible circumstance.
   We are now in a position to understand what alchemy is.  We might even go fu
rther and say that even if we had never heard of it, we know what it must be.
   Let us emphasize the fact that the final product is in all cases a living th
ing.  It has been the great stumbling block to modern research that the stateme
nts of alchemists cannot be explained away.  From the chemical standpoint it ha
s seemed not "a priori" impossible that lead should be turned into gold.  Our r
ecent discovery of the periodicity of the elements has made it seem likely, at
least in theory, that our apparently immutable elements should be modifications
 of a single one.>  Organic Chemistry, with its metatheses and syntheses depend
ent on the conceptions of molecules as geometrical structures has demonstrated
a praxis which gives this theory body; and the properties of Radium have driven
 the Old Guard from the redoubt which flew the flag of the essential heterogene
ity of the elements.  The doctrines of Evolution have brought the alchemical an
d monistic theory of matter into line with our conception of life; the collapse
 of the wall between the animal and vegetable kingdoms has shaken that which di
vided them from the mineral.
   But even though the advanced chemist might admit the possibility of transmut
ing lead into gold, he could not conceive of that {186} gold as other than meta
llic, of the same order of nature as the lead from which it had been made.  Tha
t this gold should possess the power of multiplying itself, or of acting as a f
erment upon other substances, seemed so absurd that he felt obliged to conclude
 that the alchemists who claimed these properties for their Gold must, after al
l, have been referring not to Chemistry, but to some spiritual operations whose
 sanctity demanded some such symbolic veil as the cryptographic use of the lang
uage of the laboratory.
   The MASTER THERION is sanguine that his present reduction of all cases of th
e art of Magick to a single formula will both elucidate and vindicate Alchemy,
while extending chemistry to cover all classes of Change.
   There is an obvious condition which limits our proposed operations.  This is
 that, as the formula of any Work effects the extraction and visualization of t
he Truth from any "First Matter", the "Stone" or "Elixir" which results from ou
r labours will be the pure and perfect Individual originally inherent in the su
bstance chosen, and nothing else.  The most skilful gardener cannot produce lil
ies from the wild rose; his roses will always be roses, however he have perfect
ed the properties of this stock.
   There is here no contradiction with our previous thesis of the ultimate unit
y of all substance.  It is true that Hobbs and Nobbs are both modifications of
the Pleroma.  Both vanish in the Pleroma when they attain Samadhi.  But they ar
e not interchangeable to the extent that they are individual modifications; the
 initiate Hobbs is not the initiate Nobbs any more than Hobbs the haberdasher i
s Nobbs of "the nail an sarspan business as he got his money by".  Our skill in
 producing aniline dyes does not enable us to dispense with the original anilin
e, and use sugar instead.  Thus the Alchemists said: "To make gold you must tak
e gold"; their art was to bring each substance to the perfection of its own pro
per nature.
   No doubt, part of this process involved the withdrawal of the essence of the
 "First Matter" within the homogeneity of "Hyle", just as initiation insists on
 the annihilation of the individual in the Impersonal Infinity of Existence to
emerge once more as a less confused and deformed Eidolon of the Truth of Himsel
f.  This is the guarantee that he is uncontaminated by alien elements.  The {18
7} "Elixir" must possess the activity of a "nascent" substance, just as "nascen
t" hydrogen combines with arsenic (in "Marsh's test") when the ordinary form of
 the gas is inert.  Again, oxygen satisfied by sodium or diluted by nitrogen wi
ll not attack combustible materials with the vehemence proper to the pure gas.
   We may summarize this thesis by saying that Alchemy includes as many possibl
e operations as there are original ideas inherent in nature.
   Alchemy resembles evocation in its selection of appropriate material bases f
or the manifestation of the Will; but differs from it in proceeding without per
sonification, or the intervention of alien planes.>  It may be more closely com
pared with Initiation; for the effective element of the Product is of the essen
ce of its own nature, and inherent therein; the Work similarly consists in isol
ating it from its accretions.
   Now just as the Aspirant, on the Threshold of Initiation, finds himself assa
iled by the "complexes" which have corrupted him, their externalization excruci
ating him, and his agonized reluctance to their elimination plunging him into s
uch ordeals that he seems (both to himself and to others) to have turned from a
 noble and upright man into an unutterable scoundrel; so does the "First Matter
" blacken and putrefy as the Alchemist breaks up its coagulations of impurity.
   The student may work out for himself the various analogies involved, and dis
cover the "Black Dragon", the "Green Lion", the "Lunar Water", the "Raven's Hea
d", and so forth.  The indications above given should suffice all who possess a
ptitude for Alchemical Research.
   Only one further reflection appears necessary; namely, that the Eucharist, w
ith which this chapter is properly preoccupied, must be conceived as one case -
-- as the critical case --- of the Art of the Alchemist.
   The reader will have observed, perhaps with surprise, that The MASTER THERIO
N describes several types of Eucharist.  The reason is that given above; there
is no substance incompetent to {188} serve as an element in some Sacrament; als
o, each spiritual Grace should possess its peculiar form of Mass, and therefore
 its own "materia magica".  It is utterly unscientific to treat "God" as a univ
ersal homogeneity, and use the same means to prolong life as to bewitch cattle.
  One does not invoke "Electricity" indiscriminately to light one's house and t
o propel one's brougham; one works by measured application of one's powers to i
ntelligent analytical comprehension of the conditions of each separate case.
   There is a Eucharist for every Grace that we may need; we must apprehend the
 essential characters in each case, select suitable elements, and devise proper
 processes.
   To consider the classical problems of Alchemy:  The Medicine of Metals must
be the quintessence of some substance that serves to determine the structure (o
r rate of vibration) whose manifestation is in characteristic metallic qualitie
s.  This need not be a chemical substance at all in the ordinary sense of the w
ord.
   The Elixir of Life will similarly consist of a living organism capable of gr
owth, at the expense of its environment; and of such a nature that its "true Wi
ll" is to cause that environment to serve it as its means of expression in the
physical world of human life.
   The Universal Medicine will be a menstruum of such subtlety as to be able to
 penetrate all matter and transmute it in the sense of its own tendency, while
of such impartial purity as to accept perfectly the impression of the Will of t
he Alchemist.  This substance, properly prepared, and properly charged, is able
 to perform all things soever that are physically possible, within the limits o
f the proportions of its momentum to the inertia of the object to which it is a
pplied.
   It may be observed in conclusion that, in dealing with forms of Matter-Motio
n so subtle as these, it is not enough to pass the Pons Asinorum of intellectua
l knowledge.
   The MASTER THERION has possessed the theory of these Powers for many years;
but His practice is still in progress towards perfection.  Even efficiency in t
he preparation is not all; there is need to be judicious in the manipulation, a
nd adroit in the administration, of the product.  He does not perform haphazard
 miracles, but applies His science and skill in conformity with the laws of nat
ure.

                          CHAPTER XXI

                        OF BLACK MAGIC
           OF THE MAIN TYPES OF THE OPERATIONS OF MAGICK ART
                 AND OF THE POWERS OF THE SPHINX

                               I

   As was said at the opening of the second chapter, the Single Supreme Ritual
is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.
 "It is the raising of the complete man in a vertical straight line."
   Any deviation from this line tends to become black magic.  Any other operati
on is black magic.
   In the True Operation the Exaltation is equilibrated by an expansion in the
other three arms of the Cross.  Hence the Angel immediately gives the Adept pow
er over the Four Great Princes and their servitors.>
 If the magician needs to perform any other operation than this, it is only law
ful in so far as it is a necessary preliminary to That One Work.
 There are, however many shades of grey.  It is not every magician who is well
armed with theory.  Perhaps one such may invoke Jupiter, with the wish to heal
others of their physical ills.  This sort of thing is harmless,> or almost so.
 It is not evil in {190} itself.  It arises from a defect of understanding.  Un
til the Great Work has been performed, it is presumptuous for the magician to p
retend to understand the universe, and dictate its policy.  Only the Master of
the Temple can say whether any given act is a crime. "Slay that innocent child?
"  (I hear the ignorant say)  "What a horror!" "Ah!" replies the Knower, with f
oresight of history, "but that child will become Nero.  Hasten to strangle him!
"
   There is a third, above these, who understands that Nero was as necessary as
 Julius Caesar.
   The Master of the Temple accordingly interferes not with the scheme of thing
s except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to do.  Why shoul
d he struggle against imprisonment, banishment, death?  It is all part of the g
ame in which he is a pawn.  "It was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer thes
e things, and to enter into His glory."
   The Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests that al
l these matters are of no importance to Him.  It may be of importance to His Wo
rk that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged.  In such a case He informs h
is Magus, who exerts the power intrusted to HIm, and it happens accordingly.  Y
et all happens naturally, and of necessity, and to all appearance without a wor
d from Him.
   Nor will the mere Master of the Temple, as a rule, presume to act upon the U
niverse, save as the servant of his own destiny.  It is only the Magus, He of t
he grade above, who has attained to Chokhmah, Wisdom, and so dare act.  He must
 dare act, although it like Him not.  But He must assume the Curse of His grade
, as it is written in the Book of the Magus.>
   There are, of course, entirely black forms of magic.  To him who has not giv
en every drop of his blood for the cup of BABALON {191} all magic power is dang
erous.  There are even more debased and evil forms, things in themselves black.
  Such is the use of spiritual force to material ends.  Christian Scientists, M
ental Healers, Professional Diviners, Psychics and the like, are all "ipso fact
o" Black Magicians.
   They exchange gold for dross.  They sell their higher powers for gross and t
emporary benefit.
   That the most crass ignorance of Magick is their principal characteristic is
 no excuse, even if Nature accepted excuses, which she does not.  If you drink
poison in mistake for wine, your "mistake" will not save your life.
   Below these in one sense, yet far above them in another, are the Brothers of
 the Left Hand Path>.  These are they who "shut themselves up", who refuse thei
r blood to the Cup, who have trampled Love in the Race for self-aggrandisment.
   As far as the grade of Exempt Adept, they are on the same path as the White
Brotherhood; for until that grade is attained, the goal is not disclosed.  Then
 only are the goats, the lonely leaping mountain-masters, separated from the gr
egarious huddling valley-bound sheep.  Then those who have well learned the les
sons of the Path are ready to be torn asunder, to give up their own life to the
 Babe of the Abyss which is --- and is not --- they.
   The others, proud in their purple, refuse.  They make themselves a false cro
wn of the Horror of the Abyss;  they set the Dispersion of Choronzon upon their
 brows; they clothe themselves in the poisoned robes of Form; they shut themsel
ves up; and when the force that made them what they are is exhausted, their str
ong towers fall, they become the Eaters of Dung in the Day of Be-with-us, and t
heir shreds, strewn in the Abyss, are lost.
   Not so the Masters of the Temple, that sit as piles of dust in the City of t
he Pyramids, awaiting the Great Flame that shall consume that dust to ashes.  F
or the blood that they have surrendered is treasured in the Cup of OUR LADY BAB
ALON, a mighty {192} medicine to awake the Eld of the All-Father, and redeem th
e Virgin of the World from her virginity.

                              II

   Before leaving the subject of Black Magic, one may touch lightly on the ques
tion of Pacts with the Devil.
   The Devil does not exist.  It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers
 to imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions.  A devil who had uni
ty would be a God>.
   It was said by the Sorcerer of the Jura that in order to invoke the Devil it
 is only necessary to call him with your whole will.
   This is an universal magical truth, and applies to every other being as much
 as to the Devil.  For the whole will of every man is in reality the whole will
 of the Universe.
   It is, however, always easy to call up the demons, for they are always calli
ng you; and you have only to step down to their level {193} and fraternize with
 them.  They will tear you in pieces at their leisure.  Not at once; they will
wait until you have wholly broken the link between you and your Holy Guardian A
ngel before they pounce, lest at the last moment you escape.
   Anthony of Padua and (in our own times) "Macgregor" Mathers are examples of
such victims.
 Nevertheless, every magician must firmly extend his empire to the depth of hel
l.  "My adepts stand upright, their heads above the heavens, their feet below t
he hells.">
   This is the reason why the magician who performs the Operation of the "Sacre
d Magic of Abramelin the Mage", immediately after attaining to the Knowledge an
d Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, must evoke the Four Great Princes of
 the Evil of the World.
   "Obedience and faith to Him that liveth and triumpheth, that reigneth above
you in your palaces as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth" is your duty to
your Holy Guardian Angel, and the duty of the demon world to you.
   These powers of "evil" nature are wild beasts; they must be tamed, trained t
o the saddle and the bridle; they will bear you well.  There is nothing useless
 in the Universe: do not wrap up your Talent in a napkin, because it is only "d
irty money"!
   With regard to Pacts, they are rarely lawful.  There should be no bargain st
ruck.  Magick is not a trade, and no hucksters need apply.  Master everything,
but give generously to your servants, once they have unconditionally submitted.
   There is also the questions of alliances with various Powers.  These again a
re hardly ever allowable.>  No Power which is not {194} a microcosm in itself -
-- and even archangels reach rarely to this centre of balance --- is fit to tre
at on an equality with Man.  The proper study of mankind is God; with Him is hi
s business; and with Him alone.  Some magicians have hired legions of spirits f
or some special purpose; but it has always proved a serious mistake.  The whole
 idea of exchange is foreign to magick.  The dignity of the magician forbids co
mpacts.  "The Earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof".

                              III

 The operations of Magick art are difficult to classify, as they merge into eac
h other, owing to the essential unity of their method and result.  We may menti
on:

   1.  Operations such as evocation, in which a live spirit is brought from dea
d matter.

   2.  Consecrations of talismans in which a live spirit is bound into "dead" m
atter and vivifies the same.

   3.  Works of divination, in which a live spirit is made to control operation
s of the hand or brain of the Magician.  Such works are accordingly most danger
ous, to be used only by advanced magicians, and then with great care.

   4.  Works of fascination, such as operations of invisibility, and transforma
tions of the apparent form of the person or thing concerned.  This consists alm
ost altogether in distracting the attention, or disturbing the judgment, of the
 person whom it is wished to deceive.  There are, however, "real" transformatio
ns of the adept himself which are very useful.  See the Book of the Dead for me
thods.  The assumption of God-Forms can be carried to the point of actual trans
formation.

   5.  Works of Love and Hate, which are also performed (as {195} a rule) by fa
scination.  These works are too easy; and rarely useful.  They have a nasty tri
ck of recoiling on the magician.

   6.  Works of destruction, which may be done in many different ways.  One may
 fascinate and bend to one's will a person who has of his own right the power t
o destroy.  One may employ spirits or talismans.  The more powerful magicians o
f the last few centuries have employed books.
   In private matters these works are very easy, if they be necessary.  An adep
t known to The MASTER THERION once found it necessary to slay a Circe who was b
ewitching brethren.  He merely walked to the door of her room, and drew an Astr
al T ("traditore", and the symbol of Saturn) with an astral dagger.  Within 48
hours she shot herself.>

   7.  Works of creation and dissolution, and the higher invocations.
   There are also hundreds of other operations;> to bring wanted objects --- go
ld, books, women and the like; to open locked doors, to discover treasure; to s
wim under water; to have armed men at command --- etc., etc.  All these are rea
lly matters of detail; the Adeptus Major will easily understand how to perform
them if necessary.> {196}
 It should be added that all these things happen "naturally".>  Perform an oper
ation to bring gold --- your rich uncle dies and leaves you his money; books --
- you see the book wanted in a catalogue that very day, although you have adver
tised in vain for a year; woman --- but if you have made the spirits bring you
enough gold, this operation will become unnecessary.>
   It must further be remarked that it is absolute Black Magic to use any of th
ese powers if the object can possibly be otherwise attained.  If your child is
drowning, you must jump and try to save him; it won't do to invoke the Undines.
   Nor is it lawful in all circumstances to invoke those Undines even where the
 case is hopeless; maybe it is necessary to you and to the child that it should
 die.  An Exempt Adept on the right road will make no error here --- an Adept M
ajor is only too likely to do so.  A through apprehension of this book will arm
 adepts of every grade against all the more serious blunders incidental to thei
r unfortunate positions.

                              IV

   Necromancy is of sufficient importance to demand a section to itself.
   It is justifiable in some exceptional cases.  Suppose the magician fail to o
btain access to living Teachers, or should he need some {197} especial piece of
 knowledge which he has reason to believe died with some teacher of the past, i
t may be useful to evoke the "shade" of such a one, or read the "Akasic record"
 of his mind.>
   If this be done it must be done properly very much on the lines of the evoca
tion of Apollonius of Tyana, which Eliphas Levi performed.>
  The utmost care must be taken to prevent personation of the "shade".  It is o
f course easy, but can rarely be advisable, to evoke the shade of a suicide, or
 of one violently slain or suddenly dead.  Of what use is such an operation, sa
ve to gratify curiosity or vanity?
 One must add a word on spiritism, which is a sort of indiscriminate necromancy
 --- one might prefer the word necrophilia --- by amateurs.  They make themselv
es perfectly passive, and, so far from employing any methods of protection, del
iberately invite all and sundry spirits, demons, shells of the dead, all the ex
crement and filth of earth and hell, to squirt their slime over them.  This inv
itation is readily accepted, unless a clean man be present with an aura good en
ough to frighten these foul denizens of the pit.
   No spiritualistic manifestation has ever taken place in the {198} presence e
ven of FRATER PERDURABO; how much less in that of The MASTER THERION!>
   Of all the creatures He ever met, the most prominent of English spiritists (
a journalist and pacifist of more than European fame) had the filthiest mind an
d the foulest mouth.  He would break off any conversation to tell a stupid smut
ty story, and could hardly conceive of any society assembling for any other pur
pose than "phallic orgies", whatever they may be.  Utterly incapable of keeping
 to a subject, he would drag the conversation down again and again to the sole
subject of which he really thought --- sex and sex-perversions and sex and sex
and sex and sex again.
   This was the plain result of his spiritism.  All spiritists are more or less
 similarly afflicted.  They feel dirty even across the street; their auras are
ragged, muddy and malodorous; they ooze the slime of putrefying corpses.
   No spiritist, once he is wholly enmeshed in sentimentality and Freudian fear
-phantasms, is capable of concentrated thought, of persistent will, or of moral
 character.  Devoid of every spark of the divine light which was his birthright
, a prey before death to the ghastly tenants of the grave, the wretch, like the
 mesmerized and living corpse of Poe's Monsieur Valdemar, is a "nearly liquid m
ass of loathsome, of detestable putrescence."
   The student of this Holy Magick is most earnestly warned against frequenting
 their seances, or even admitting them to his presence.
   They are contagious as Syphilis, and more deadly and disgusting.  Unless you
r aura is strong enough to inhibit any manifestation of the loathly larvae that
 have taken up their habitation in them, shun them as you need not mere lepers!
> {199}


                               V

  Of the powers of the Sphinx much has been written.>  Wisely they have been ke
pt in the forefront of true magical instruction.  Even the tyro can always ratt
le off that he has to know, to dare to will and to keep silence.  It is difficu
lt to write on this subject, for these powers are indeed comprehensive, and the
 interplay of one with the other becomes increasingly evident as one goes more
deeply into the subject.
   But there is one general principle which seems worthy of special emphasis in
 this place.  These four powers are thus complex because they are the powers of
 the Sphinx, that is, they are functions of a single organism.
   Now those who understand the growth of organisms are aware that evolution de
pends on adaptation to environment.  If an animal which cannot swim is occasion
ally thrown into water, it may escape by some piece of good fortune, but if it
is thrown into water continuously it will drown sooner or later, unless it lear
ns to swim.
   Organisms being to a certain extent elastic, they soon adapt themselves to a
 new environment, provided that the change is not so sudden as to destroy that
elasticity.
 Now a change in environment involves a repeated meeting of new conditions, and
 if you want to adapt yourself to any given set of conditions, the best thing y
ou can do is to place yourself cautiously and persistently among them.  That is
 the foundation of all education.
   The old-fashioned pedagogues were not all so stupid as some modern educators
 would have us think.  The principle of the system was to strike the brain a se
ries of constantly repeated blows until the proper reaction became normal to th
e organism.
   It is not desirable to use ideas which excite interest, or may come {200} in
 handy later as weapons, in this fundamental training of the mind.  It is much
better to compel the mind to busy itself with root ideas which do not mean very
 much to the child, because you are not trying to excite the brain, but to dril
l it.  For this reason, all the best minds have been trained by preliminary stu
dy of classics and mathematics.
   The same principle applies to the training of the body.  The original exerci
ses should be of a character to train the muscles generally to perform any kind
 of work, rather than to train them for some special kind of work, concentratio
n of which will unfit them for other tasks by depriving them of the elasticity
which is the proper condition of life.>
   In Magick and meditation this principle applies with tremendous force.  It i
s quite useless to teach people how to perform magical operations, when it may
be that such operations, when they have learned to do them, are not in accordan
ce with their wills.  What must be done is to drill the Aspirant in the hard ro
utine of the elements of the Royal Art.
   So far as mysticism is concerned, the technique is extremely simple, and has
 been very simply described in Part I of this Book 4.  It cannot be said too st
rongly that any amount of mystical success whatever is no compensation for slac
kness with regard to the technique.  There may come a time when Samadhi itself
is no part of the business of the mystic.  But the character developed by the o
riginal training remains an asset.  In other words, the person who has made him
self a first-class brain capable of elasticity is competent to {201} attack any
 problem soever, when he who has merely specialized has got into a groove, and
can no longer adapt and adjust himself to new conditions.
   The principle is quite universal.  You do not train a violinist to play the
Beethoven Concerto; you train him to play every conceivable consecution of note
s with perfect ease, and you keep him at the most monotonous drill possible for
 years and years before you allow him to go on the platform.  You make of him a
n instrument perfectly able to adjust itself to any musical problem that may be
 set before him.  This technique of Yoga is the most important detail of all ou
r work.  The MASTER THERION has been himself somewhat to blame in representing
this technique as of value simply because it leads to the great rewards, such a
s Samadhi.  He would have been wiser to base His teaching solely on the ground
of evolution.  But probably He thought of the words of the poet:
        "You dangle a carrot in front of her nose,
        And she goes wherever the carrot goes."
For, after all, one cannot explain the necessity of the study of Latin either t
o imbecile children or to stupid educationalists; for, not having learned Latin
, they have not developed the brains to learn anything.
   The Hindus, understanding these difficulties, have taken the God-Almighty at
titude about the matter.  If you go to a Hindu teacher, he treats you as less t
han an earthworm.  You have to do this, and you have to do that, and you are no
t allowed to know why you are doing it.>
   After years of experience in teaching, The MASTER THERION is not altogether
convinced that this is not the right attitude.  {202} When people begin to argu
e about things instead of doing them, they become absolutely impossible.  Their
 minds begin to work about it and about, and they come out by the same door as
in they went.  They remain brutish, voluble, and uncomprehending.
   The technique of Magick is just as important as that of mysticism, but here
we have a very much more difficult problem, because the original unit of Magick
, the Body of Light, is already something unfamiliar to the ordinary person.  N
evertheless, this body must be developed and trained with exactly the same rigi
d discipline as the brain in the case of mysticism.  The essence of the techniq
ue of Magick is the development of the body of Light, which must be extended to
 include all members of the organism, and indeed of the cosmos.
 The most important drill practices are:
   1.  The fortification of the Body of Light by the constant use of rituals, b
y the assumption of god-forms, and by the right use of the Eucharist.
   2.  The purification and consecration and exaltation of that Body by the use
 of rituals of invocation.
   3.  The education of that Body by experience.  It must learn to travel on ev
ery plane; to break down every obstacle which may confront it.  This experience
 must be as systematic and regular as possible; for it is of no use merely to t
ravel to the spheres of Jupiter and Venus, or even to explore the 30 Aethyrs, n
eglecting unattractive meridians.>  {203}
   The object is to possess a Body which is capable of doing easily any particu
lar task that may lie before it.  There must be no selection of special experie
nce which appeals to one's immediate desire.  One must go steadily through all
possible pylons.
   FRATER PERDRABO was very unfortunate in not having magical teachers to expla
in these things to Him.  He was rather encouraged in unsystematic working.  Ver
y fortunate, on the other hand, was He to have found a Guru who instructed Him
in the proper principles of the technique of Yoga, and He, having sufficient se
nse to recognize the universal application of those principles, was able to som
e extent to repair His original defects.  But even to this day, despite the fac
t that His original inclination is much stronger towards Magick than towards my
sticism, he is much less competent in Magick.>  A trace of this can be seen eve
n in His method of combining the two divisions of our science, for in that meth
od He makes concentration bear the Cross of the work.
   This is possibly an error, probably a defect, certainly an impurity of thoug
ht, and the root of it is to be found in His original bad discipline with regar
d to Magick.
   If the reader will turn to the account of his astral journeys in the Second
Number of the First Volume of the Equinox, he will find that these experiments
were quite capricious.  Even when, in Mexico, He got the idea of exploring the
30 Aethyrs systematically, He abandoned the vision after only 2 Aethyrs had bee
n investigated.  {204}
   Very different is His record after the training in 1901 e.v. had put Him in
the way of discipline.>
   At the conclusion of this part of this book, one may sum up the whole matter
 in these words: There is no object whatever worthy of attainment but the regul
ar development of the being of the Aspirant by steady scientific work; he shoul
d not attempt to run before he can walk; he should not wish to go somewhere unt
il he knows for certain whither he wills to go.

   The object of this course of reading is to familiarize the student with all
that has been said by the Great Masters in every time and country.  He should m
ake a critical examination of them; not so much with the idea of discovering wh
ere truth lies, for he cannot do this except by virtue of his own spiritual exp
erience, but rather to discover the essential harmony in those varied works.  H
e should be on his guard against partisanship with a favourite author.  He shou
ld familiarize himself thoroughly with the method of mental equilibrium, endeav
ouring to contradict any statement soever, although it may be apparently axioma
tic.
   The general object of this course, besides that already stated, is to assure
 sound education in occult matters, so that when spiritual illumination comes i
t may find a well-built temple.  Where the mind is strongly biased towards any
special theory, the result of an illumination is often to inflame that portion
of the mind which is thus overdeveloped, with the result that the aspirant, ins
tead of becoming an Adept, becomes a bigot and fanatic.  {211}
   The A.'. A.'. does not offer examination in this course, but recommends thes
e books as the foundation of a library.

mprehensive course of reading.

                       ONE STAR IN SIGHT.

Thy feet in mire, thine head in murk,
    O man, how piteous thy plight,
The doubts that daunt, the ills that irk,
    Thou hast nor wit nor will to fight ---
How hope in heart, or worth in work?
    No star in sight!

Thy gods proved puppets of the priest.
    "Truth?  All's relation!" science sighed.
In bondage with thy brother beast,
    Love tortured thee, as Love's hope died
And Lover's faith rotted.  Life no least
    Dim star descried.

Thy cringing carrion cowered and crawled
    To find itself a chance-cast clod
Whose Pain was purposeless; appalled
    That aimless accident thus trod
Its agony, that void skies sprawled
    On the vain sod!

All souls eternally exist,
    Each individual, ultimate,
Perfect --- each makes itself a mist
    Of mind and flesh to celebrate
With some twin mask their tender tryst
    Insatiate.  {229}

Some drunkards, doting on the dream,
    Despair that it should die, mistake
Themselves for their own shadow-scheme.
    One star can summon them to wake
To self; star-souls serene that gleam
    On life's calm lake.

That shall end never that began.
     All things endure because they are.
Do what thou wilt, for every man
     And every woman is a star.
Pan is not dead; he liveth, Pan!
    Break down the bar!

To man I come, the number of
    A man my number, Lion of Light;
I am The Beast whose Law is Love.
    Love under will, his royal right ---
Behold within, and not above,
    One star in sight!


                       ONE STAR IN SIGHT.

   A glimpse of the structure and system of the Great White Brotherhood.

                          A.'. A.'.>.

   Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

   1.  The Order of the Star called S. S. is, in respect of its existence upon
the Earth, an organized body of men and women distinguished among their fellows
 by the qualities here enumerated.  They exist in their own Truth, which is bot
h universal and unique.  {230} They move in accordance with their own Wills, wh
ich are each unique, yet coherent with the universal will.
   They perceive (that is, understand, know, and feel) in love, which is both u
nique and universal.
   2.  The order consists of eleven grades or degrees, and is numbered as follo
ws: these compose three groups, the Orders of the S. S., of the R. C., and of t
he G. D. respectively.

                 "The Order of the S. S."

        Ipsissimus .................. 10 Degree = 1Square
        Magus .......................  9 Degree = 2Square
        Magister Templi .............  8 Degree = 3Square

                 "The Order of the R. C."

               (Babe of the Abyss --- the link)

        Adeptus Exemptus ............  7 Degree = 4Square
        Adeptus Major ...............  6 Degree = 5Square
        Adeptus Minor ...............  5 Degree = 6Square

                 "The Order of the G. D."

               (Dominus Liminis --- the link)

        Philosophus .................  4 Degree = 7Square
        Practicus ...................  3 Degree = 8Square
        Zelator .....................  2 Degree = 9Square
        Neophyte ....................  1 Degree = 10Square
        Probationer .................  0 Degree = 0Square

   (These figures have special meanings to the initiated and are commonly emplo
yed to designate the grades.)

   The general characteristics and attributions of these Grades are indicated b
y their correspondences on the Tree of Life, as may be studied in detail in the
 Book 777.

Student. --- His business is to acquire a general intellectual
   knowledge of all systems of attainment, as declared in the
 prescribed books.  (See curriculum in Appendix I.)  {231}

Probationer. --- His principal business is to begin such practices
   as he my prefer, and to write a careful record of the same for
   one year.

Neophyte. --- Has to acquire perfect control of the Astral Plane.

Zelator. --- His main work is to achieve complete success in Asana
   and Pranayama.  He also begins to study the formula of the
   Rosy Cross.

Practicus. --- Is expected to complete his intellectual training, and
   in particular to study the Qabalah.

Philosophus. --- Is expected to complete his moral training.  He
 is tested in Devotion to the Order.

Dominus Liminis. --- Is expected to show mastery of Pratyahara
   and Dharana.

Adeptus (without). --- is expected to perform the Great Work
   and to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy
   Guardian Angel.

Adeptus (within). --- Is admitted to the practice of the formula
   of the Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost.

Adeptus (Major). --- Obtains a general mastery of practical
   Magick, though without comprehension.

Adeptus (Exemptus). --- Completes in perfection all these matters.
   He then either ("a") becomes a Brother of the Left
   Hand Path or, ("b") is stripped of all his attainments and of himself
   as well, even of his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes
   a babe of the Abyss, who, having transcended the Reason,
   does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother.  It then
 finds itself a

Magister Templi. --- (Master of the Temple): whose functions
   are fully described in Liber 418, as is this whole initiation
 from Adeptus Exemptus.  See also "Aha!".  His principal
   business is to tend his "garden" of disciples, and to obtain a
   perfect understanding of the Universe.  He is a Master of
   Samadhi.  {232}

Magus. --- Attains to wisdom, declares his law (See Liber I, vel
   Magi) and is a Master of all Magick in its greatest and
   highest sense.

Ipsissimus. --- Is beyond all this and beyond all comprehension
   of those of lower degrees.

   But of these last three Grades see some further account in "The Temple of So
lomon the King", Equinox I to X and elsewhere.
   It should be stated that these Grades are not necessarily attained fully, an
d in strict consecution, or manifested wholly on all planes.  The subject is ve
ry difficult, and entirely beyond the limits of this small treatise.
   We append a more detailed account.

   3.  "The Order of the S. S." is composed of those who have crossed the Abyss
; the implications of this expression may be studied in Liber 418, the 14th, 13
th, 12th, 11th, 10th, and 9th Aethyrs in particular.
   All members of the Order are in full possession of the Formulae of Attainmen
t, both mystical or inwardly-directed and Magical or outwardly-directed.  They
have full experience of attainment in both these paths.
   They are all, however, bound by the original and fundamental Oath of the Ord
er, to devote their energy to assisting the Progress of their Inferiors in the
Order.  Those who accept the rewards of their emancipation for themselves are n
o longer within the Order.
   Members of the Order are each entitled to found Orders dependent on themselv
es on the lines of the R. C. and G. D. orders, to cover types of emancipation a
nd illumination not contemplated by the original (or main) system.  All such or
ders must, however, be constituted in harmony with the A.'. A.'. as regards the
 essential principles.
   All members of the Order are in possession of the Word of the existing Aeon,
 and govern themselves thereby.
   They are entitled to communicate directly with any and every member of the O
rder, as they may deem fitting.
   Every active Member of the Order has destroyed all that He is and all that h
e has on crossing the Abyss; but a star is cast forth in {233} the Heavens to e
nlighten the Earth, so that he may possess a vehicle wherein he may communicate
 with mankind.  The quality and position of this star, and its functions, are d
etermined by the nature of the incarnations transcended by him.

   4.  The Grade of Ipsissimus is not to be described fully; but its opening is
 indicated in Liber I vel Magi.
 There is also an account in a certain secret document to be published when pro
priety permits.  Here it is only said this:  The Ipsissimus is wholly free from
 all limitations soever, existing in the nature of all things without discrimin
ations of quantity or quality between them.  He has identified Being and not-Be
ing and Becoming, action and non-action and tendency to action, with all other
such triplicities, not distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions
, or between any one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or with
out conditions.
   He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to expres
s its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within the veils
 of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep silence during his human li
fe as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members of the Order.
   The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that i
s, his being is entirely free from internal or external necessity.  His work is
 to destroy all tendencies to construct or to cancel such necessities.  He is t
he Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta).
   The Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being: He has no will in any
 direction, and no Consciousness of any kind involving duality, for in Him all
is accomplished; as it is written "beyond the Word and the Fool, yea, beyond th
e Word and the Fool".

   5.  The Grade of Magus is described in Liber I vel Magi, and there are accou
nts of its character in Liber 418 in the Higher Aethyrs.
   There is also a full and precise description of the attainment of this Grade
 in the Magical Record of the Beast 666.
   The essential characteristic of the Grade is that its possessor utters a Cre
ative Magical Word, which transforms the planet on {234} which he lives by the
installation of new officers to preside over its initiation.  This can take pla
ce only at an "Equinox of the Gods" at the end of an "Aeon"; that is, when the
secret formula which expresses the Law of its action becomes outworn and useles
s to its further development.
 (Thus "Suckling" is the formula of an infant: when teeth appear it marks a new
 "Aeon", whose "Word" is "Eating").
   A Magus can therefore only appear as such to the world at intervals of some
centuries; accounts of historical Magi, and their Words, are given in Liber Ale
ph.
   This does not mean that only one man can attain this Grade in any one Aeon,
so far as the Order is concerned.  A man can make personal progress equivalent
to that of a "Word of an Aeon"; but he will identify himself with the current w
ord, and exert his will to establish it, lest he conflict with the work of the
Magus who uttered the Word of the Aeon in which He is living.
   The Magus is pre-eminently the Master of Magick, that is, his will is entire
ly free from internal diversion or external opposition; His work is to create a
 new Universe in accordance with His Will.  He is the Master of the Law of Chan
ge (Anicca).
   To attain the Grade of Ipsissimus he must accomplish three tasks, destroying
 the Three Guardians mentioned in Liber 418, the 3rd Aethyr; Madness, and False
hood, and Glamour, that is, Duality in Act, Word and Thought.

   6.  The Grade of Master of the Temple is described in Liber 418 as above ind
icated.  There are full accounts in the Magical Diaries of the Beast 666, who w
as cast forth into the Heaven of Jupiter, and of Omnia in Uno, Unus in Omnibus,
 who was cast forth into the sphere of the Elements.
   The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that personality whi
ch limits and oppresses his true self.
   The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that is, His U
nderstanding is entirely free from internal contradiction or external obscurity
;  His word is to comprehend the existing Universe in accordance with His own M
ind.  He is the Master of the Law of Sorrow (Dukkha).
   To attain the grade of Magus he must accomplish Three 235} Tasks;  the renun
ciation of His enjoyment of the Infinite so that he may formulate Himself as th
e Finite; the acquisition of the practical secrets alike of initiating and gove
rning His proposed new Universe and the identification of himself with the impe
rsonal idea of Love.  Any neophyte of the Order (or, as some say, any person so
ever) possesses the right to claim the Grade of Master of the Temple by taking
the Oath of the Grade.  It is hardly necessary to observe that to do so is the
most sublime and awful responsibility which it is possible to assume, and an un
worthy person who does so incurs the most terrific penalties by his presumption
.

   7.  "The Order of the R. C."  The Grade of the Babe of the Abyss is not a Gr
ade in the proper sense, being rather a passage between the two Orders.  Its ch
aracteristics are wholly negative, as it is attained by the resolve of the Adep
tus Exemptus to surrender all that he has and is for ever.  It is an annihilati
on of all the bonds that compose the self or constitute the Cosmos, a resolutio
n of all complexities into their elements, and these thereby cease to manifest,
 since things are only knowable in respect of their relation to, and reaction o
n, other things.

   8.  The Grade of Adeptus Exemptus confers authority to govern the two lower
Orders of R. C. and G. D.
   The Adept must prepare and publish a thesis setting forth His knowledge of t
he Universe, and his proposals for its welfare and progress.  He will thus be k
nown as the leader of a school of thought.
   (Eliphas Levi's "Clef des Grands Mysteres," the works of Swedenborg, von Eck
arshausen, Robert Fludd, Paracelsus, Newton, Bolyai, Hinton, Berkeley, Loyola,
etc., etc., are examples of such essays.)
   He will have attained all but the supreme summits of meditation, and should
be already prepared to perceive that the only possible course for him is to dev
ote himself utterly to helping his fellow creatures.
   To attain the Grade of Magister Templi, he must perform two tasks; the emanc
ipation from thought by putting each idea against its opposite, and refusing to
 prefer either; and the consecration of {236} himself as a pure vehicle for the
 influence of the order to which he aspires.
   He must then decide upon the critical adventure of our Order; the absolute a
bandonment of himself and his attainments.  He cannot remain indefinitely an Ex
empt Adept; he is pushed onward by the irresistible momentum that he has genera
ted.
   Should he fail, by will or weakness, to make his self-annihilation absolute,
 he is none the less thrust forth into the Abyss; but instead of being received
 and reconstructed in the Third Order, as a Babe in the womb of our Lady BABALO
N, under the Night of Pan, to grow up to be Himself wholly and truly as He was
not previously, he remains in the Abyss, secreting his elements round his Ego a
s if isolated from the Universe, and becomes what is called a "Black Brother".
 Such a being is gradually disintegrated from lack of nourishment and the slow
but certain action of the attraction of the rest of the Universe, despite effor
ts to insulate and protect himself, and to aggrandise himself by predatory prac
tices.  He may indeed prosper for a while, but in the end he must perish, espec
ially when with a new Aeon a new word is proclaimed which he cannot and will no
t hear, so that he is handicapped by trying to use an obsolete method of Magick
, like a man with a boomerang in a battle where every one else has a rifle.

   9.  The Grade of Adeptus Major confers Magical Powers (strictly so-called) o
f the second rank.
   His work is to use these to support the authority of the Exempt Adept his su
perior.  (This is not to be understood as an obligation of personal subservienc
e or even loyalty; but as a necessary part of his duty to assist his inferiors.
  For the authority of the Teaching and governing Adept is the basis of all ord
erly work.)
   To attain the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he must accomplish Three Tasks; the
 acquisition of absolute Self-Reliance, working in complete isolation, yet tran
smitting the word of his superior clearly, forcibly and subtly; and the compreh
ension and use of the Revolution of the wheel of force, under its three success
ive forms of Radiation, Conduction and Convection (Mercury, Sulphur, Salt; or S
attvas, Rajas, Tamas), with their corresponding natures on {237} other planes.
 Thirdly, he must exert his whole power and authority to govern the Members of
lower Grades with balanced vigour and initiative in such a way as to allow no d
ispute or complaint; he must employ to this end the formula called "The Beast c
onjoined with the Woman" which establishes a new incarnation of deity; as in th
e legends of Leda, Semele, Miriam, Pasiphae, and others.  He must set up this i
deal for the orders which he rules, so that they may possess a not too abstract
 rallying point suited to their undeveloped states.

   10.  The Grade of Adeptus Minor is the main theme of the instructions of the
 A.'. A.'.  It is characterised by the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversa
tion of the Holy Guardian Angel.  (See the Equinox, "The Temple of Solomon the
King;" "The Vision and the Voice" 8th Aethyr; also "Liber Samekh", etc. etc.)
This is the essential work of every man; none other ranks with it either for pe
rsonal progress or for power to help one's fellows.  This unachieved, man is no
 more than the unhappiest and blindest of animals.  He is conscious of his own
incomprehensible calamity, and clumsily incapable of repairing it.  Achieved, h
e is no less than the co-heir of gods, a Lord of Light.  He is conscious of his
 own consecrated course, and confidently ready to run it.  The Adeptus Minor ne
eds little help or guidance even from his superiors in our Order.
   His work is to manifest the Beauty of the Order to the world, in the way tha
t his superiors enjoin, and his genius dictates.
   To attain the Grade Adeptus Major, he must accomplish two tasks; the equilib
ration of himself, especially as to his passions, so that he has no preference
for any one course of conduct over another, and the fulfilment of every action
by its complement, so that whatever he does leaves him without temptation to wa
nder from the way of his True Will.
   Secondly, he must keep silence, while he nails his body to the tree of his c
reative will, in the shape of that Will, leaving his head and arms to form the
symbol of Light, as if to make oath that his every thought, word and deed shoul
d express the Light derived from the God with which he has identified his life,
 his love and his liberty --- symbolised by his heart, his phallus, and his leg
s.  It {238} is impossible to lay down precise rules by which a man may attain
to the knowledge and conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel; for that is the p
articular secret of each one of us; as secret not to be told or even divined by
 any other, whatever his grade.  It is the Holy of Holies, whereof each man is
his own High Priest, and none knoweth the Name of his brother's God, or the Rit
e that invokes Him.
   The Masters of the A.'. A.'. have therefore made no attempt to institute any
 regular ritual for this central Work of their Order, save the generalised inst
ructions in Liber 418 (the 8th Aethyr) and the detailed Canon and Rubric of the
 Mass actually used with success by FRATER PERDURABO in His attainment.  This h
as been written down by Himself in Liber Samekh.  But they have published such
accounts as those in "The Temple of Solomon the King" and in "John St. John." T
hey have taken the only proper course; to train aspirants to this attainment in
 the theory and practice of the whole of Magick and Mysticism, so that each man
 may be expert in the handling of all known weapons, and free to choose and to
use those which his own experience and instinct dictate as proper when he essay
s the Great Experiment.
   He is furthermore trained to the one habit essential to Membership of the A.
'. A.'.; he must regard all his attainments as primarily the property of those
less advanced aspirants who are confided to his charge.
   No attainment soever is officially recognised by the A.'. A.'. unless the im
mediate inferior of the person in question has been fitted by him to take his p
lace.
   The rule is not rigidly applied in all cases, as it would lead to congestion
, especially in the lower grades where the need is greatest, and the conditions
 most confused; but it is never relaxed in the Order of the R. C. or of the S.
S.: save only in One Case.
   There is also a rule that the Members of the A.'. A.'. shall not know each o
ther officially, save only each Member his superior who introduced him and his
inferior whom he has himself introduced.
   This rule has been relaxed, and a "Grand Neophyte" appointed to superintend
all Members of the Order of the G. D.  The real object of the rule was to preve
nt Members of the same Grade {239} working together and so blurring each other'
s individuality; also to prevent work developing into social intercourse.
   The Grades of the Order of the G. D. are fully described in Liber 185>, and
there is no need to amplify what is there stated.  It must however, be carefull
y remarked that in each of these preliminary Grades there are appointed certain
 tasks appropriate, and that the ample accomplishment of each and every one of
these is insisted upon with the most rigorous rigidity.>
   Members of the A.'. A.'. of whatever grade are not bound or expected or even
 encouraged to work on any stated lines, or with any special object, save as ha
s been above set forth.  There is however an absolute prohibition to accept mon
ey or other material reward, directly or indirectly, in respect of any service
connected with the Order, for personal profit or advantage.  The penalty is imm
ediate expulsion, with no possibility of reinstatement on any terms soever.
   But all members must of necessity work in accordance with the facts of Natur
e, just as an architect must allow of the Law of Gravitation, or a sailor recko
n with currents.
   So must all Members of the A.'. A.'. work by the Magical Formula of the Aeon
.
   They must accept the Book of the Law as the Word and the Letter of Truth, an
d the sole Rule of Life.>  They must acknowledge the Authority of the Beast 666
 and of the Scarlet Woman as {240} in the book it is defined, and accept Their
Will> as concentrating the Will of our Whole Order.  They must accept the Crown
ed and Conquering Child as the Lord of the Aeon, and exert themselves to establ
ish His reign upon Earth.  They must acknowledge that "The word of the Law is
GR:Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha." and that "Love is the law, love under wi
ll."
   Each member must make it his main work to discover for himself his own true
will, and to do it, and do nothing else.>
   He must accept those orders in the Book of the Law that apply to himself as
being necessarily in accordance with his own true will, and execute the same to
 the letter with all the energy, courage, and ability that he can command.  Thi
s applies especially to the work of extending the Law in the world, wherein his
 proof is his own success, the witness of his Life to the Law that hath given h
im light in his ways, and liberty to pursue them.  Thus doing, he payeth his de
bt to the Law that hath freed him by working its will to free all men; and he p
roveth himself a true man in our Order by willing to bring his fellows into fre
edom.
   By thus ordering his disposition, he will fit himself in the best possible m
anner for the task of understanding and mastering the divers technical methods
prescribed by the A.'. A.'. for Mystical and Magical attainment.
   He will thus prepare himself properly for the crisis of his career in the Or
der, the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Ange
l.
 His Angel shall lead him anon to the summit of the Order of the R. C. and make
 him ready to face the unspeakable terror of the Abyss which lies between Manho
od and Godhead; teach him to Know that agony, to Dare that destiny, to Will tha
t catastrophe, {241} and to keep Silence for ever as he accomplishes the act of
 annihilation.
   From the Abyss comes No Man forth, but a Star startles the Earth, and our Or
der rejoices above that Abyss that the Beast hath begotten one more Babe in the
 Womb of Our Lady, His concubine, the Scarlet Woman, BABALON.
   There is not need to instruct a Babe thus born, for in the Abyss it was puri
fied of every poison of personality; its ascent to the highest is assured, in i
ts season, and it hath no need of seasons for it is conscious that all conditio
ns are no more than forms of its fancy.
   Such is a brief account, adapted as far as may be to the average aspirant to
 Adeptship, or Attainment, or Initiation, or Mastership, or Union with God, or
Spiritual Development, or Mahatmaship, or Freedom, or Occult Knowledge, or what
ever he may call his inmost need of Truth, of our Order of A.'. A.'.
   It is designed principally to awake interest in the possibilities of human p
rogress, and to proclaim the principles of the A.'. A.'.
   The outline given of the several successive steps is exact; the two crises -
- the Angel and the Abyss --- are necessary features in every career.  The othe
r tasks are not always accomplished in the order given here; one man, for examp
le, may acquire many of the qualities peculiar to the Adeptus Major, and yet la
ck some of those proper to the Practicus.>  But the system here given shows {24
3} the correct order of events, as they are arranged in Nature; and in no case
is it safe for a man to neglect to master any single detail, however dreary and
 distasteful it may seem.  It often does so, indeed; that only insists on the n
ecessity of dealing with it.  The dislike and contempt for it bear witness to a
 weakness and incompleteness in the nature which disowns it; that particular ga
p in one's defences may admit the enemy at the very turning-point of some battl
e.  Worse, one were shamed for ever if one's inferior should happen to ask for
advice and aid on that subject and one were to fail in service to him!  His fai
lure --- one's own failure also!  No step, however well won for oneself, till h
e is ready for his own advance!
   Every Member of the A.'. A.'. must be armed at all points, and expert with e
very weapon.  The examinations in every Grade are strict and severe; no loose o
r vague answers are accepted.  In intellectual questions, the candidate must di
splay no less mastery of his subject than if he were entered in the "final" for
 Doctor of Science or Law at a first class University.
   In examination of physical practices, there is a standardised test.  In Asan
a, for instance, the candidate must remain motionless for a given time, his suc
cess being gauged by poising on his head a cup filled with water to the brim; i
f he spill one drop, he is rejected.
   He is tested in "the Spirit Vision" or "Astral Journeying" by giving him a s
ymbol unknown and unintelligible to him, and he must interpret its nature by me
ans of a vision as exactly as if he had read its name and description in the bo
ok when it was chosen.
   The power to make and "charge" talismans is tested as if they were scientifi
c instruments of precision, as they are.
   In the Qabalah, the candidate must discover for himself, and prove to the ex
aminer beyond all doubt, the properties of a number never previously examined b
y any student. {243}
   In invocation the divine force must be made as manifest and unmistakable as
the effects of chloroform; in evocation, the spirit called forth must be at lea
st as visible and tangible as the heaviest vapours; in divination, the answer m
ust be as precise as a scientific thesis, and as accurate as an audit; in medit
ation, the results must read like a specialist's report of a classical case.
   But such methods, the A.'. A.'. intends to make occult science as systematic
 and scientific as chemistry; to rescue it from the ill repute which, thanks bo
th to the ignorant and dishonest quacks that have prostituted its name, and to
the fanatical and narrow-minded enthusiasts that have turned it into a fetish,
has made it an object of aversion to those very minds whose enthusiasm and inte
grity make them most in need of its benefits, and most fit to obtain them.
   It is the one really important science, for it transcends the conditions of
material existence and so is not liable to perish with the planet, and it must
be studied as a science, sceptically, with the utmost energy and patience.
   The A.'. A.'. possesses the secrets of success; it makes no secret of its kn
owledge, and if its secrets are not everywhere known and practised, it is becau
se the abuses connected with the name of occult science disincline official inv
estigators to examine the evidence at their disposal.
   This paper has been written not only with the object of attracting individua
l seekers into the way of Truth, but of affirming the propriety of the methods
of the A.'. A.'. as the basis for the next great step in the advance of human k
nowledge.
   Love is the law, love under will.

                         APPENDIX III


   Notes on the nature of the "Astral Plane">.

   1) What are "Astral" and "Spiritual Beings?
   Man is one: it is a case of any consciousness assuming a sensible form.
   Microcosms and elementals.  Maybe an elemental (e.g. a dog) has a cosmic con
ception in which he is a microcosm and man incomplete.  No means of deciding sa
me, as in case of kinds of space.>
   Similarly, our gross matter may appear unreal to Beings clad in fine matter.
  Thus, science thinks vulgar perceptions "error".  We cannot perceive at all e
xcept within our gamut; as, concentrated perfumes, which seem malodorous, and t
ime-hidden facts, such as the vanes of a revolving fan, which flies can disting
uish.
   "Hence:" no "a priori" reason to deny the existence of conscious intelligenc
es with insensible bodies.  Indeed we know of other "orders" of mind (flies, et
c., possibly vegetables) thinking by means of non-human brain-structures.
   But the fundamental problem of Religion is this: Is there any praeter-human
Intelligence, of the same order as our own, {245} which is not dependent on cer
ebral structures consisting of matter in the vulgar sense of the word?

   2) "Matter" includes all that is movable.  Thus, electric waves are "matter"
.  There is no reason to deny the existence of Beings who perceive by other mea
ns those subtle forces which we only perceive by our instruments.

   3) We can influence other Beings, conscious or no, as lion-tamers, gardeners
, etc., and are influenced by them, as by storms, bacilli, etc.

   4) There is an apparent gap between our senses and their correspondences in
consciousness.  Theory needs a medium to join matter and spirit, just as physic
s once needed an "ether" to transmit and transmute vibrations.

   5) We may consider all beings as parts of ourselves, but it is more convenie
nt to regard them as independent.  Maximum Convenience is our cannon of "Truth"
.>  We may thus refer {246} psychical phenomena to the intention of "Astral" Be
ings, without committing ourselves to any theory.  Coherence is the sole qualit
y demanded of us.

   6)  Magick enables us to receive sensible impressions of worlds other than t
he "physical" universe (as generally understood by profane science).  These wor
lds have their own laws; their inhabitants are often of quasi-human intelligenc
e; there is a definite set of relations between certain "ideas" of ours, and th
eir expressions, and certain types of phenomena. (Thus symbols, the Qabalah, et
c. enable us to communicate with whom we choose.)

   7)  "Astral" Beings possess knowledge and power of a different kind from our
 own; their "universe" is presumably of a different kind from ours, in some res
pects.  (Our idea "bone" is not the same as a dog's; a short-sighted man sees t
hings differently to one of normal vision.)  It is more convenient to assume th
e objective existence of an "Angel" who gives us new knowledge than to allege t
hat our invocation has awakened a supernormal power in ourselves.  Such inciden
ts as "Calderazzo"> and "Jacob"> make this more cogent.  {247}

   8)  The Qabalah maps ourselves by means of a convention.  Every aspect of ev
ery object may thus be referred to the Tree of Life, and evoked by using the pr
oper keys.

   9)  Time and Space are forms by which we obtain (distorted) images of Ideas.
  Our measures of Time and Space> are crude conventions, and differ widely for
different Beings.  (Hashish shows how the same mind may vary.)

   10) We may admit that any aspect of any object or idea may be presented to u
s in a symbolic form, whose relation to its Being is irrational. (Thus, there i
s no rational link between seeing a bell struck and hearing its chime.  Our not
ion of "bell" is no more than a personification of its impressions on our sense
s.  And our wit and power to make a bell "to order" imply a series of correspon
dences between various orders of nature precisely analogous to Magick, when we
obtain a Vision of Beauty by the use of certain colours, forms, sounds, etc.)

   11) "Astral" Beings may thus be defined in the same way as "material objects
"; they are the Unknown Causes of various observed effects.  They may be of any
 order of existence.  We give a physical form and name to a bell but not to its
 tone, though in each case we know nothing but our own impressions.  But we rec
ord musical sounds by a special convention.  We may therefore call a certain se
t of qualities "Ratziel", or describe an impression as "Saturnian" without pret
ending to know what anything is in itself.  All we need is to know how to cast
a bell that will please our ears, or how to evoke a "spirit" that will tell us
things that are hidden from our intellectual faculties.

   12) (a) Every object soever may be considered as possessed of an "Astral sha
pe", sensible to our subtle perceptions.  This "astral shape" is to its materia
l basis as our human character is to our physical appearance.  We may imagine t
his astral shape: e.g. we may "see" a jar of opium as a soft seductive woman wi
th a cruel smile, just as we see in the face of a cunning and dishonest man the
 features of some animal, such as a fox.  {248}
  (b) We may select any particular property of any object, and give it an astra
l shape.  Thus, we may take the tricky perils of a mountain, and personify them
 as "trolls", or the destructive energies of the simoom, as "Jinn".
   (c) We may analyse any of these symbols, obtaining a finer form; thus the "s
pirit" contains an "angel", the angel an "archangel", etc.
  (d) We may synthesize any set of symbols, obtaining a more general form.  Thu
s we may group various types of earth-spirit as gnomes.
  (e) All these may be attributed to the Tree of Life, and dealt with according
ly.
  (f) The Magician may prepare a sensible body for any of these symbols, and ev
oke them by the proper rites.

  13) The "reality" or "objectivity" of these symbols is not pertinent to the d
iscussion.  The ideas of X to the 4 power  and Sq.Rt.of  subscript -1 have prov
ed useful to the progress of mathematical advance toward Truth; it is no odds w
hether a Fourth Dimension "exists", or whether Sq.Rt.of  subscript -1 has "mean
ing" in the sense that Sq.Rt.of  subscript  4 has, the number of units in the s
ide of a square of 4 units.
   The Astral Plane --- real or imaginary --- is a danger to anybody who takes
it without the grain of salt contained in the Wisdom of the above point of view
; who violates its laws either wilfully, carelessly, ignorantly, or by presumin
g that their psychological character differentiates them from physical laws in
the narrower sense; or who abdicates his autonomy, on the ground that the subtl
er nature of astral phenomena guarantees their authority and integrity.

  (14) The variety of the general character of the "planes" of being is indefin
itely large.  But there are several main types of symbolism corresponding to th
e forms of plastic presentation established by the minds of Mankind.  Each such
 "plane" has its special appearances, inhabitants, and laws --- special cases o
f the general proposition.  Notable among these are the "Egyptian" plane, which
 conforms with the ideas and methods of magick once in vogue in the Nile valley
; the "Celtic" plane, close akin to {249} "Fairyland", with a Pagan Pantheism a
s its keynote, sometimes concealed by Christian nomenclature: the "Alchemical"
plane, where the Great Work is often presented under the form of symbolically c
onstructed landscapes occupied by quasi-heraldic animals and human types hierog
lyphically distinguished, who carry on the mysterious operations of the Hermeti
c Art.
   There are also "planes" of Parable, of Fable, and of Folk-lore; in short, ev
ery country, creed, and literature has given its characteristic mode of present
ation to some "plane" or other.
   But there are "planes" proper to every clairvoyant who explores the Astral L
ight without prejudice; in such case, things assume the form of his own mind, a
nd his perception will be clear in proportion to his personal purity.
   On the higher planes, the diversity of form, due to grossness, tends to disa
ppear.  Thus, the Astral Vision of "Isis" is utterly unlike that of "Kali".  Th
e one is of Motherhood and Wisdom, ineffably candid, clear, and loving; the oth
er of Murder and madness, blood-intoxicated, lust-befogged, and cruel.  The sol
e link is the Woman-symbol.  But whoso makes Samadhi on Kali obtains the self-s
ame Illumination as if it had been Isis; for in both cases he attains identity
with the Quintessence of the Woman-Idea, untrammelled by the qualities with whi
ch the dwellers by the Nile and the Ganges respectively disguised it.

   Thus, in low grades of initiation, dogmatic quarrels are inflamed by astral
experience; as when Saint John distinguishes between the Whore BABALON and the
Woman clothed with the Sun, between the Lamb that was slain and the Beast 666 w
hose deadly wound was healed; nor understands that Satan, the Old Serpent, in t
he Abyss, the Lake of Fire and Sulphur, is the Sun-Father, the vibration of Lif
e, Lord of Infinite Space that flames with His Consuming Energy, and is also th
at throned Light whose Spirit is suffused throughout the City of Jewels.
   Each "plane" is a veil of the one above it; the original individual Ideas be
come diversified as they express their elements.  Two men with almost identical
 ideas on a subject would write two totally different treatises upon it.

  15) The general control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find {250} one's
way about it, to penetrate such sanctuaries as are guarded from the profane, to
 make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to acquire knowledge and
 power, or to command service; all this is a question of the general Magical at
tainment of the student.
   He must be absolutely at ease in his Body of Light, and have made it invulne
rable.  He must be adept in assuming all God-forms, in using all weapons, sigil
s, gestures, words, and signs.  He must be familiar with the names and numbers
pertinent to the work in hand.  He must be alert, sensitive, and ready to exert
 his authority; yet courteous, gracious, patient, and sympathetic.

  16) There are two opposite methods of exploring the Astral Plane.
  (a). One may take some actual object in Nature, and analyse it by evoking its
 astral form, thus bringing it into knowledge and under control by applying the
 keys of the Qabalah and of Magick.
  (b). One may proceed by invoking the required idea, and giving body to the sa
me by attracting to it the corresponding elements in Nature.

  17) Every Magician possesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself, just as
no man's experience of the world is coterminous with that of another.  There wi
ll be a general agreement on the main points, of course; and so the Master Ther
ion is able to describe the principal properties of these "planes", and their l
aws, just as he might write a geography giving an account of the Five Continent
s, the Oceans and Seas, the most notable mountains and rivers; he could not pre
tend to put forth the whole knowledge that any one peasant possesses in respect
 of his district.  But, to the peasant, these petty details are precisely the m
ost important items in his daily life.  Likewise, the Magician will be grateful
 to the Master Therion for the Compass that guides him at night, the Map that e
xtends his comprehension of his country, and shows him how best he may travel a
field, the advice as to Sandals and Staff that make surer his feet, and the Boo
k that tells him how, splitting open his rocks with an Hammer, he may be master
 of their Virgin Gold.  But he will understand that his own {251} career on ear
th is his kingdom, that even the Master Therion is no more than a fellow man in
 another valley, and that he must explore and exploit his own inheritance with
his own eyes and hands.
   The Magician must not accept the Master Therion's account of the Astral Plan
e, His Qabalistic discoveries, His instructions in Magick.  They may be correct
 in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly true for any save Him, eve
n as no two artists can make identical pictures of the same subject.
   More, even in fundamentals, though these things be Truth for all Mankind, as
 we carelessly say, any one particular Magician may be the one man for whom the
y are false.  May not the flag that seems red to ten thousand seem green to som
e one other?  Then, every man and every woman being a Star, that which is green
 to him is verily green; if he consent to the crowd and call it red, hath he no
t broken the Staff of Truth that he leaneth upon?
   Each and every man therefore that will be a Magician must explore the Univer
se for himself.  This is pre-eminently the case in the matter of the Astral Pla
ne, because the symbols are so sensitive.  Nothing is easier than to suggest vi
sions, or to fashion phantasms to suit one's ideas.  It is obviously impossible
 to communicate with an independent intelligence --- the one real object of ast
ral research --- if one allows one's imagination to surround one with courtiers
 of one's own creation.  If one expects one's visions to resemble those of the
Master Therion, they are only too likely to do so; and if one's respect for Him
 induces one to accept such visions as authentic, one is being false to one's s
oul; the visions themselves will avenge it.  The true Guide being gone, the see
r will stray into a wilderness of terror where he is tricked and tortured; he w
ill invoke his idol the Master Therion, and fashion in His image a frightful ph
antasm who will mock him in his misery, until his mind stagger and fall; and, M
adness swooping upon his carrion, blast his eyes with the horror of seeing his
Master dissolve into that appalling hallucination, the "Vision of THE DEMON CRO
WLEY!"
   Remember, then, always, but especially when dealing with the Astral Plane, t
hat man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth.  What {252} one sees and hears is
"real" in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or crea
ted by one's personality.  There is no touchstone of truth: the authentic Nakhi
el is indistinguishable from the image of the Magician's private idea of Nakhie
l, so far as he is concerned.  The stronger one is to create, the more readily
the Astral Light responds, and coagulates creatures of this kind.  Not that suc
h creation is necessarily an error; but it is another branch of one's Work.  On
e cannot obtain outside help from inside sources.  One must use precautions sim
ilar to those recommended in the chapter of Divination.
   The Magician may go on for a long time being fooled and flattered by the Ast
rals that he has himself modified or manufactured.  Their natural subservience
to himself will please him, poor ape!
   They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and w
onder unspeakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the ver
y reason that they are images of himself idealized by the imagination.
   But his real progress will stop dead.  These phantasms will prevent him from
 coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can lea
rn anything new.
   He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be att
aining one initiation after another.  His Ego will expand unchecked, till he se
em to himself to have heaven at his feet.  Yet all this will be nothing but his
 fool's face of Narcissus smirking up from the pool that will drown him.
   Error of this kind on the Astral Plane --- in quite ordinary visions with no
 apparent moral import --- may lead to the most serious mischief.  Firstly, mis
takes mislead; to pollute one's view of Jupiter by permitting the influence of
Venus to distort it may end in finding oneself at odds with Jupiter, later on,
in some crisis of one's work.
   Secondly, the habit of making mistakes and leaving them uncorrected grows up
on one.  He who begins by "spelling Jeheshua with a 'Resh'" may end by writing
the name of the Dweller on the Threshold by mistake for that of his Angel.  {25
3}
   Lastly, Magick is a Pyramid, built layer by layer.  The work of the Body of
Light --- with the technique of Yoga --- is the foundation of the whole.  One's
 apprehension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for Angels, Archangels, and
 Gods are derived therefrom by analysis.  One must have pure materials if one w
ishes to brew pure beer.
   If one have an incomplete and incorrect view of the universe, how can one fi
nd out its laws?
   Thus, original omission or error tends to extend to the higher planes.  Supp
ose a Magician, invoking Sol, were persuaded by a plausible spirit of Saturn th
at he was the Solar Intelligence required, and bade him eschew human love if he
 would attain to the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel; and
 suppose that his will, and that Angel's nature, were such that the Crux of the
ir Formula was Lyrical Exaltation!
   Apart from the regular tests --- made at the time --- of the integrity of an
y spirit, the Magician must make a careful record of every vision, omitting no
detail; he must then make sure that it tallies in every point with the correspo
ndences in Book 777 and in Liber D.  Should he find (for instance) that, having
 invoked Mercury, his vision contains names whose numbers are Martial, or eleme
nts proper to Pisces, let him set himself most earnestly to discover the source
 of error, to correct it, and to prevent its recurrence.
   But these tests, as implied above, will not serve to detect personation by s
elf-suggested phantasms.  Unless one's aura be a welter of muddled symbols beyo
nd recognition, the more autohypnotic the vision is, the more smoothly it satis
fies the seer's standards.  There is nothing to puzzle him or oppose him; so he
 spins out his story with careless contempt of criticism.  He can always prove
himself right; the Qabalah can always be stretched; and Red being so nearly Ora
nge, which is really a shade of Yellow, and Yellow a component of Green which m
erges into Blue, what harm if a Fiend in Vermilion appears instead of an Angel
in Azure?
   The true, the final test, of the Truth of one's visions is their Value.  The
 most glorious experience on the Astral plane, let it dazzle and thrill as it m
ay, is not necessarily in accordance with {254} the True Will of the seer; if n
ot, though it be never so true objectively, it is not true for him, because not
 useful for him.  (Said we not a while ago that Truth was no more than the Most
 Convenient Manner of Statement?)
   It may intoxicate and exalt the Seer, it may inspire and fortify him in ever
y way, it may throw light upon most holy mysteries, yet withal be no more than
an interpretation of the individual to himself, the formula not of Abraham but
of Onan.
   These plastic "Portraits of the Artist as a Young Man" are well enough for t
hose who have heard "Know Thyself".  They are necessary, even, to assist that a
nalysis of one's nature which the Probationer of A.'. A.'. is sworn to accompli
sh.  But "Love is the law, love under will."   And Our Lady Nuit is "... divide
d for love's sake, for the chance of union."  These mirror-mirages are therefor
e not Works of Magick, according to the Law of Thelema: the true Magick of Horu
s requires the passionate union of opposites.
   Now the proof that one is in contact with an independent entity depends on a
 sensation which ought to be unmistakeable if one is in good health.  One ought
 not to be liable to mistake one's own sensible impressions for somebody else's
!  It is only Man's incurable vanity that makes the Astral "Strayed Reveller" o
r the mystic confuse his own drunken babble with the voice of the Most High.
   The essence of the right sensation consists in recognition of the reality of
 the other Being.  There will be as a rule some element of hostility, even when
 the reaction is sympathetic.  One's "soul-mate" (even) is not thought of as on
eself, at first contact.
  One must therefore insist that any real appearance of the Astral Plane gives
the sensation of meeting a stranger.  One must accept it as independent, be it
Archangel or Elf, and measure one's own reaction to it.  One must learn from it
, though one despise it; and love it, however one loathe it.
   One must realize, on writing up the record, that the meeting has effected a
definite change in oneself.  One must have known and felt something alien, and
not merely tried on a new dress.  {255}
   There must always be some slight pang of pain in a true Astral Vision; it hu
rts the Self to have to admit the existence of a not-Self; and it taxes the bra
in to register a new thought.  This is true at the first touch, even when exalt
ation and stimulation result from the joy of making an agreeable contact.
   There is a deeper effect of right reaction to a strange Self: the impact inv
ariable tends to break up some complex in the Seer.  The class of ideas concern
ed has always been tied up, labelled, and put away.  It is now necessary to unp
ack it, and rearrange its contents.  At least, the annoyance is like that of a
man who has locked and strapped his bag for a journey, and then finds that he h
as forgotten his pyjamas.  At most, it may revolutionise his ideas of the busin
ess, like an old bachelor with settled plans of life who meets a girl once too
often.
   Any really first-class Astral Vision, even on low planes, should therefore b
oth instruct the Seer, and prepare him for Initiation.  Those failing to pass t
his test are to be classed as "practice".
   One last observation seems fit.  We must not assert the "reality" or "object
ivity" of an Astral Being on no better evidence than the subjective sensation o
f its independent existence.  We must insist on proof patient to all qualified
observers if we are to establish the major premiss of Religion: that there exis
ts a Conscious Intelligence independent of brain and nerve as we know them.  If
 it have also Power, so much the better.  But we already know of inorganic forc
es; we have no evidence of inorganic conscious Mind.
   How can the Astral Plane help us here?  It is not enough to prove, as we eas
ily do, the correspondences between Invocation and Apparition>.  We must exclud
e concidence>, telepathy>, and subconscious knowledge.>  Our praeter-human Inte
lligence {256} must convey a Truth not known to any human mind, past or present
.  Yet this Truth must be verifiable.
   There is but one document in the world which presents evidence that fully sa
tisfies these conditions.  This is

                        LIBER AL vel LEGIS

                        the Book of the Law.

of this New Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and Conquering Child, the Aeon whose Log
os is THE BEAST 666, whose name in the Outer Order was FRATER PERDURABO.
   The nature of the proof of the separate existence of praeterhuman Intelligen
ce, independent of bodily form, is extremely complicated.  Its main divisions m
ay be briefly enumerated.  {257}
   AIWAZ, the name of the Intelligence in question, proves:
  (a) His power to pre-arrange events unconnected with His scribe so that they
should fit in with that scribe's private calculations.
   E.g.  The Stele which reveals the Theogony of the Book was officially number
ed 666, in the Boulak Museum.  The scribe had adopted 666 as His magical number
, many years previously.  Again, the scribe's magical House, bought years earli
er, had a name whose value was 418.  The scribe had calculated 418 as the {258}
 number of the Great Work, in 1901 e.v.  He only discovered that 418 was the nu
mber of his house in consequence of AIWAZ mentioning the fact.
  (b) His power to conceal a coherent system of numbers and letters in the text
 of a rapidly-written document, containing riddles and ciphers opening to a Mas
ter-Key unknown to the scribe, yet linked with his own system; this Key and its
 subordinates being moreover a comment on the text.  {259}
   E.g. "The word of the Law is  GR:Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha." (Will);
 this word has the value of 93.
   "Love is the law, love under will."  Love,  GR:Alpha-gamma-alpha-pi-eta, lik
e
 GR:Theta-epsilon-lambda-eta-mu-alpha, adds to 93.
   AIWAZ itself adds to 93.>
   This was all strange to the scribe; yet years later he discovered the "Lost
Word" of one of his own Orders: it was 93 also.>
   The Word of His most holy Order proved equally to count up {260} to 93.>  No
w 93 is thrice 31; 31 is LA, "Not" and AL, "The" or "God"; these words run thro
ughout the Book, giving a double meaning to many passages.  A third 31 is the c
ompound letter ShT, the two hieroglyphs of Sh and T (many centuries old) being
pictures of the "Dramatis Personae" of the Book; and ShT being a haphazard line
 scrawled on the MS. touch letters which added to 418, valuing "this circle squ
ared in its failure" as  GR:pi correct to six places of decimals, etc.
   Again: "thou shalt know not">, meaning "thou shalt know LA"; and "he shall d
iscover the Key of it all">, "id est," the Key AL.

  (c) His power to combine subsequent events beyond the control of the scribe o
r his associates, so that they confirmed statements in the Book.  Or, per contr
a, to predict such events.
   E.g.  The first Scarlet Woman proved unworthy, and suffered the exact penalt
ies predicted.
   Again, "one cometh after thee; he shall discover the key.">  This one was to
 be the "child" of the scribe, "and that strangely">.
   Nine months after THE BEAST 666 had gotten a Magical "child" upon His concub
ine Jane Foster, a "Babe of the Abyss" was born, Frater Achad asserting his rig
ht to that grade, and thus "coming after" THE BEAST 666, who had been the last
Adept to do so.  And this "child" was definitely "one", since "one" is the mean
ing of his motto Achad.  Finally, he did in fact "discover the key of it all">
after THE BEAST Himself had failed to do so in 14 years of study.

  (d) His power to conceive and express in concise terms true solutions of the
main problems of the Universe.
   E.g. The formula of Nuith and Hadith explain Existence in the terms of Mathe
matical-Logical Philosophy, so as to satisfy the difficulties of reconciling Du
alism, Monism and Nihilism; all {261} antinomies in all spheres; and the Origin
al Perfection with the Manifest Imperfection of Things.
   Again "Do that thou wilt...", the most sublimely austere ethical precept eve
r uttered, despite its apparent licence, is seen on analysis to be indeed "...t
he whole of the Law.", the sole and sufficient warrant for human action, the se
lf-evident Code of Righteousness, the identification of Fate with Freewill, and
 the end of the Civil War in Man's nature by appointing the Canon of Truth, the
 conformity of things with themselves, to determine his every act.  "Do what th
ou wilt..." is to bid Stars to shine, Vines to bear grapes, Water to seek its l
evel; man is the only being in Nature that has striven to set himself at odds w
ith himself.

  (e) His power to interpret the Spirit of the New Aeon, the relapse into ruthl
ess savagery of the most civilized races, at a time when war was discredited by
 most responsible men.

  (f) His power to comprehend and control these various orders of ideas and eve
nts, demonstrating thereby a mind and a means of action intelligible to, yet im
mensely above, all human capacity; to bind the whole into a compact cryptograph
 displaying mastery of English, of mathematical and philosophical conceptions,
of poetic splendour and intense passion, while concealing in the letters and wo
rds a complex cipher involving the knowledge of facts never till than existing
in any human mind, and depending on the control of the arm of the scribe, thoug
h He thought He was writing consciously from dictation; and to weave into a sin
gle pattern so many threads of proof of different orders that every type of min
d, so it be but open and just, may be sure of the existence of AIWAZ as a being
 independent of body, conscious and individual, with a mind mightier than man's
, and a power beyond man's set in motion by will.
   In a word, the Book of the Law proves the prime postulate of Religion.
   The Magician may therefore be confident that Spiritual Beings exist, and see
k the Knowledge and conversation of His own Holy Guardian Angel with the same a
rdour as that of FRATER PERDURABO when He abandoned all: love, wealth, rank, fa
me, to seek Him.  Nay, this he must do or condemn himself to be {262} torn asun
der by the Maenads of his insensate impulses; he hath no safety save he himself
 be Bacchus!  Bacchus, divine and human!  Bacchus, begotten on Semele of Zeus,
the adulterous Lord of Thunder ravishing, brutally, his virginal victim!  Bacch
us, babe hidden from hate in the most holy of holies, the secret of thy sire, i
n the Channel of the Star-Spate, Whereof one Serpent is thy soul!  Bacchus, twy
-formed, man-woman, Bacchus, whose innocence tames the Tiger, while yet thy hor
ns drip blood upon thy mouth, and sharpen the merriment of wine to the madness
of murder! Bacchus, Thy thyrsus oozes sap; thine ivy clings to it; thy Lion-ski
n slips from thy sleek shoulders, slips from thy lissome loins; drunk on deligh
t of the godly grape, thou knowest no more the burden of the body and the vexat
ion of the spirit.

   Come, Bacchus, come thou hither, come out of the East; come out of the East,
 astride the Ass of Priapus!  Come with thy revel of dancers and singers!  Who
followeth thee, forbearing to laugh and to leap?  Come, in thy name Dionysus, t
hat maidens be mated to God-head!  Come, in thy name Iacchus, with thy mystical
 fan to winnow the air, each gust of thy Spirit inspiring our Soul, that we bea
r to thee Sons in Thine Image!

   Verily and Amen!  Let not the Magician forget for a single second what is hi
s one sole business.  His uninitiated "self" (as he absurdly thinks it) is a mo
b of wild women, hysterical from uncomprehended and unstated animal instinct; t
hey will tear Pentheus, the merely human king who presumes to repress them, int
o mere shreds of flesh; his own mother, Nature, the first to claw at his windpi
pe!  None but Bacchus, the Holy Guardian Angel, hath grace to be God to this ri
ot of maniacs; he alone can transform the disorderly rabble into a pageant of h
armonious movements, tune their hyaena howls to the symphony of a paean, and th
eir reasonless rage to self-controlled rapture.  It is this Angel whose nature
is doubly double, that He may partake of every sacrament.  He is at once a God
who is drunken with the wine of earth, and the mammal who quaffs the Blood of G
od to purge him of mortality.  He is a woman as he accepts all impulses, are th
ey not His?  He is a man to stamp Himself upon whatever would hallow itself to
Him.  He wields the Wand, {263} with cone of pine and ivy tendrils; the Angel c
reates continually, wreathing His Will in clinging beauty, imperishably green.
   The Tiger, the symbol of the brutal passions of man, gambols about its maste
r's heels; and He bestrides the Ass of Priapus; he makes his sexual force carry
 him whither He wills to go.
   Let the Magician therefore adventure himself upon the Astral Plane with the
declared design to penetrate to a sanctuary of discarnate Beings such as are ab
le to instruct and fortify him, also to prove their identity by testimony beyon
d rebuttal.  All explanations other than these are of value only as extending a
nd equilibrating Knowledge, or possibly as supplying Energy to such Magicians a
s may have found their way to the Sources of Strength.  In all cases, naught is
 worth an obol save as it serve to help the One Great Work.
  He who would reach Intelligences of the type under discussion may expect extr
eme difficulty.  The paths are guarded; there is a lion in the way.  Technical
expertness will not serve here; it is necessary to satisfy the Warders of one's
 right to enter the presence of the Master.  Particular pledges may be demanded
, ordeals imposed, and initiations conferred.  These are most serious matters;
the Body of Light must be fully adult, irrevocably fixed, or it will be disinte
grated at the outset.  But, being fit to pass through such experiences, it is b
ound utterly to its words and acts.  It cannot even appear to break an oath, as
 its fleshly fellow may do.
   Such, then is a general description of the Astral Plane, and of the proper c
onduct of the Magician in his dealings therewith.

                 ARS CONGRESSUS CUM DAEMONE.

SECTION A       Let the Adeptus Minor be standing in this circle on the
             square of Tiphereth, armed with his Wand and Cup; but let him
             perform the Ritual throughout in his Body of Light.  He may
             burn the Cakes of Light, or the Incense of Abramelin; he may
             be prepared by Liber CLXXV, the reading of Liber LXV, and by
             the practices of Yoga.  He may invoke Hadit by "... wine and
             strange drugs" if he so will.>  He prepares
             the circle by the usual formulae of Banishing and
             Consecration, etc.
                He recites Section A as a rehearsal before His Holy
             Guardian Angel of the attributes of that Angel.  Each phrase
             must be realized with full concentration of force, so as to
             make Samadhi as perfectly as possible upon the truth
             proclaimed.
"Line 1"          He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and the Kether
             thereof; one formulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of
             Nuith.
"Line 2,3,4"      He asserts that His Angel has created (for the purpose of
             self-realization through projection in conditioned Form) three
             pairs of opposites: (a) The Fixed and the Volatile; (b) The
             Unmanifested and the Manifest; and (c) the Unmoved and the
             Moved.  Otherwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of
             Matter, Mind and Motion.
"Line 5"          He acclaims his Angel as "Himself Made Perfect"; adding
             that this Individuality is inscrutable in inviolable.  In the
             Neophyte Ritual of {274} G.'. D.'. (As it is printed in Equinox
             I, II, for the old aeon) the Hierophant is the perfected
             Osiris, who brings the candidate, the natural Osiris, to
             identity with himself.  But in the new Aeon the Hierophant is
             Horus (Liber CCXX, I, 49) therefore the Candidate will be
             Horus too.  What then is the formula of the initiation of
             Horus?  It will no longer be that of the Man, through Death.
             It will be the natural growth of the Child.  His experiences
             will no more be regarded as catastrophic.  Their hieroglyph is
             the Fool: the innocent and impotent Harpocrates Babe becomes
             the Horus Adult by obtaining the Wand.  "Der reine Thor"
             seizes the Sacred Lance.  Bacchus becomes Pan.  The Holy
             Guardian Angel is the Unconscious Creature Self --- the
             Spiritual Phallus.  His knowledge and conversation contributes
             occult puberty.  It is therefore advisable to replace the name
             Asar Un-nefer by that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit at the outset, and by
             that of one's own Holy Guardian Angel when it has been
             communicated.

"Line 6"          He hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and devours
             Godhead, for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God.

"Line 7"          He hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and
             devours Godhead, for the purpose of the Incarnation of any
             God.  The combined action of these two DEVILS is to allow the
             God upon whom they prey to enter into enjoyment of existence
             through the Sacrament of dividual "Life" (Bread --- the flesh
             of BESZ) and "Love" (Wine --- the blood or venom of AOPHRASZ).

"Line 8"          He acclaims His Angel as having "eaten of the Fruit of the
             Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil"; otherwise, having become
             wise (in the {275} Dyad, Chokmah) to apprehend the formula of
             Equilibrium which is now His own, being able to apply Himself
             accurately to His self-appointed environment.

"Line 9"          He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love
             as the Magical formula of the Universe, that He may resolve
             the phenomenal again into its noumenal phase by uniting any
             two opposites in ecstasic passion.

"Line 10"         He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula
             of Love should effect not only the dissolution of the
             separateness of the Lovers into His own impersonal Godhead,
             but their co-ordination in a "Child" quintessentialized from
             its parents to constitute a higher order of Being than theirs,
             so that each generation is an alchemical progress towards
             perfection in the direction of successive complexities.  As
             Line 9 asserts Involution, Line 10 asserts Evolution.

"Line 11"         He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of
             self-realization; the object of Incarnation is to obtain its
             reactions to its relations with other incarnated Beings and to
             observe theirs with each other.

                            ----------

Section Aa.

"Line 1"          The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious
             communication with His Angel, on the ground that that Angel
             has Himself taught him the Secret Magick by which he may make
             the proper link.  "Mosheh" is M H, the formation in Jechidah,
             Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach, --- The Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod
             --- since 45 is GR:Sigma{=summation} 1-9 while Sh, 300, is
             GR:Sigma{=summation} 1-24, which superadds to these Nine an extra
             Fifteen numbers.  (See in Liber D {276} the meanings an
             correspondences of 9, 15, 24, 45, 300, 345.)
                45 is moreover A D M, man.  "Mosheh" is thus the name of
             man as a God-concealing form.  But in the Ritual let the Adept
             replace this "Mosheh" by his own motto as Adeptus Minor.  For
             "Ishrael" let him prefer his own Magical Race, according to
             the obligations of his Oaths to Our Holy Order!  (The Beast
             666 Himself used "Ankh-f-n-Khonsu" and "Khem" in this
             section.)
"Line 2"          The Adept reminds his Angel that He has created That One
             Substance of which Hermes hath written in the Table of
             Emerald, whose virtue is to unite in itself all opposite modes
             of Being, thereby to serve as a Talisman charged with the
             Spiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or Stone composed of
             the physical basis of Life.  This Commemoration is placed
             between the two personal appeals to the Angel, as if to claim
             privilege to partake of this Eucharist which createth,
             sustaineth and redeemeth all things.
"Line 3"          He now asserts that he is himself the "Angel" or messenger
             of his Angel; that is, that he is a mind and body whose office
             is to receive and transmit the Word of his Angel.  He hails
             his Angel not only as "un-nefer" the Perfection of "Asar"
             himself as a man, but as Ptah-Apophrasz-Ra, the identity
             (Hadit) wrapped in the Dragon (Nuit) and thereby manifested as
             a Sun (Ra-Hoor-Khuit).  The "Egg" (or Heart) "girt with a
             Serpent" is a cognate symbol; the idea is thus expressed later
             in the ritual.  (See Liber LXV. which expands this to the
             uttermost.)

Section B       The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the
             sections now following B to Gg.  He is to travel astrally
             around the circle, making the appropriate pentagrams, sigils,
             and signs.  His direction {277} is widdershins.  He thus makes
             three curves, each covering three-fourths of the circle.  He
             should give the sign of the Enterer on passing the Kiblah, or
             Direction of Boleskine.  This picks up the force naturally
             radiating from that point> and projects it in the direction of
             the path of the Magician.  The sigils are those given
             in the Equinox Vol. I, No. 7, Plate X outside the
             square; the signs those shewn in Vol. I, No. 2, Plate "The
             Signs of the Grades".  In these invocations he should expand
             his girth and his stature to the utmost>, assuming the form and th
e consciousness of the Elemental
             God of the quarter.  After this, he begins to vibrate the
             "Barbarous Names" of the Ritual.
                Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost
             with the force of the Names; but let him formulate his Will,
             understood thoroughly as the dynamic aspect of his Creative
             Self, in an appearance symbolically apt, I say not in the form
             of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery Sword, or of aught save that
             bodily Vehicle of the Holy Ghost which is sacred to BAPHOMET,
             by its virtue that concealeth the Lion and the Serpent that
             His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for ever.
                Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in
             this imagined Shape and let it radiate with the Light proper
             to the element invoked, and let each Word issue along the
             Shaft with passionate impulse, as if its voice gave command
             thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly forward.  Let
             also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of the
             Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second Word as for the
             First, and Four Times for {278} the Third as the Second, and
             thus to the end.  Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his
             whole consciousness thither.  Then at the final Word, let him
             bring rushing back his Will within himself, steadily
             streaming, and let him offer himself to its point, as Artemis
             to PAN, that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element
             purge him thoroughly, and possess him with its passion.
                In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Element,
             let the Adept utter the Charge "Hear me, and make", etc. with
             strong sense that this unity with that quarter of the Universe
             confers upon him the fullest freedom and privilege appurtenant
             thereto.
                Let the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge.  The
             "Firmament" is the Ruach, the "mental plane"; it is the realm
             of Shu, or Zeus, where revolves the Wheel of the Gunas, the
             Three forms> of Being.  The Aethyr is the {279}
             "akasha", the "Spirit", the Aethyr or physics, which is the
             framework on which all forms are founded; it receives, records
             and transmits all impulses without itself suffering mutation
             thereby.  The "Earth" is the sphere wherein the operation of
             these "fundamental" and aethyric forces appears to perception.
             "Under the Earth" is the world of those phenomena which inform
             those perceived projections, and determine their particular
             character.  "Dry land" is the place of dead "material things",
             dry (i.e. unknowable) because unable to act on our minds.
             "Water" is the vehicle whereby we feel such things; "air"
             their menstruum wherein these feelings are mentally
             apprehended.  It is called "whirling" because of the
             instability of thought, and the fatuity of reason, on which we
             are yet dependent for what we call "life".  "Rushing Fire" is
             the world in which wandering thought burns up to swift-darting
             Will.  These four stages explain how the non-Ego is transmuted
             into the {280} Ego.  A "Spell" of God is any form of
             consciousness, and a "Scourge" any form of action.
                The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control
             of every detail of the Universe which His Angel has created as
             a means of manifesting Himself to Himself.  It covers command
             of the primary projection of the Possible in individuality, in
             the antithetical artifice which is the device of Mind, and in
             a balanced triplicity of modes or states of being whose
             combinations constitute the characteristics of Cosmos.  It
             includes also a standard of structure, a rigidity to make
             reference possible.  Upon these foundations of condition which
             are not things in themselves, but the canon to which things
             conform, is builded the Temple of Being, whose materials are
             themselves perfectly mysterious, inscrutable as the Soul, and
             like the Soul imagining themselves by symbols which we may
             feel, perceive, and adapt to our use without ever knowing the
             whole Truth about them.  The Adept sums up all these items by
             claiming authority over every form of expression possible to
             Existence, whether it be a "spell" (idea) or a "scourge" (act)
             of "God", that is, of himself.  The Adept must accept every
             "spirit", every "spell", every "scourge", as part of his
             environment, and make them all "subject to" himself; that is,
             consider them as contributory causes of himself.  They have
             made him what he is.  They correspond exactly to his own
             faculties.  They are all --- ultimately --- of equal
             importance.  The fact that he is what he is proves that each
             item is equilibrated.  The impact of each new impression
             affects the entire system in due measure.  He must therefore
             realize that every event is subject to him.  It occurs because
             he had need of it.  Iron rusts because the molecules demand
             oxygen for the satisfaction of {281} their tendencies.  They
             do not crave hydrogen; therefore combination with that gas is
             an event which does not happen.  All experiences contribute to
             make us complete in ourselves.  We feel ourselves subject to
             them so long as we fail to recognise this; when we do, we
             perceive that they are subject to us.  And whenever we strive
             to evade an experience, whatever it may be, we thereby do
             wrong to ourselves.  We thwart our own tendencies.  To live is
             to change; and to oppose change is to revolt against the law
             which we have enacted to govern our lives.  To resent destiny
             is thus to abdicate our sovereignty, and to invoke death.
             Indeed, we have decreed the doom of death for every breach of
             the law of Life.  And every failure to incorporate any
             impression starves the particular faculty which stood in need
             of it.
                This Section B invokes Air in the East, with a shaft of
             golden glory.

                            --------

Section C.      The adept now invokes Fire in the South; flame red are the
             rays that burst from his Verendum.

                            --------

Section D.      He invokes Water in the West, his Wand billowing forth blue
             radiance.

                            --------

Section E.      He goes to the North to invoke Earth; flowers of green
             flame flash from his weapon.  As practice makes the Adept
             perfect in this Work, it becomes automatic to attach all these
             complicated ideas and intentions to their correlated words and
             acts.  When this is attained he may go deeper into the formula
             by amplifying its correspondences.  Thus, he may invoke water
             in the manner of water, extending {282} his will with majestic
             and irresistible motion, mindful of its impulse gravitation,
             yet with a suave and tranquil appearance of weakness.  Again,
             he may apply the formula of water to its peculiar purpose as
             it surges back into his sphere, using it with conscious skill
             for the cleansing and calming of the receptive and emotional
             elements in his character, and for the solution or sweeping
             away of those tangled weeds of prejudice which hamper him from
             freedom to act as he will.  Similar applications of the
             remaining invocations will occur to the Adept who is ready to
             use them.

                            --------

Section F.      The Adept now returns to the Tiphereth square of his Tau,
             and invokes spirit, facing toward Boleskine, by the active
             Pentagrams, the sigil called the Mark of the Beast, and the
             Signs of L.V.X. (See plate as before).  He then vibrates the
             Names extending his will in the same way as before, but
             vertically upward.  At the same time he expands the Source of
             that Will --- the secret symbol of Self --- both about him and
             below, as if to affirm that Self, duplex as is its form,
             reluctant to acquiesce in its failure to coincide with the
             Sphere of Nuith.  Let him now imagine, at the last Word, that
             the Head of his will, where his consciousness is fixed, opens
             its fissure (the Brahmarandra-Cakkra, at the junction of the
             cranial sutures) and exudes a drop of clear crystalline dew,
             and that this pearl is his Soul, a virgin offering to his
             Angel, pressed forth from his being by the intensity of his
             Aspiration.

                            --------

Section Ff.     With these words the Adept does not withdraw his will
             within him as in the previous Sections.  He thinks of them as
             a reflection of Truth on the {283} surface of the dew, where
             his Soul hides trembling.  He takes them to be the first
             formulation in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy
             Guardian Angel.
"Line 1."         The "Gods" include all the conscious elements of his
             nature.
"Line 2."         The "Universe" includes all possible phenomena of which he
             can be aware.
"Line 3."         The "Winds" are his thoughts, which have prevented him from
             attaining to his Angel.
"Line 4."         His Angel has made "Voice", the magical weapon which
             produces "Words", and these words have been the wisdom by
             which He hath created all things.  The "Voice" is necessary as
             the link between the Adept and his Angel.  The Angel is
             "King", the One who "can", the "source of authority and the
             fount of honour"; also the King (or King's Son) who delivers
             the Enchanted Princess, and makes her his Queen.  He is
             "Ruler", the "unconscious Will"; to be thwarted no more by the
             ignorant and capricious false will of the conscious man.  And
             He is "Helper", the author of the infallible impulse that
             sends the Soul sweeping along the skies on its proper path
             with such impetus that the attraction of alien orbs is no
             longer sufficient to swerve it.  The "Hear me" clause is now
             uttered by the normal human consciousness, withdrawn to the
             physical body; the Adept must deliberately abandon his
             attainment, because it is not yet his whole being which burns
             up before the Beloved.

                            --------

Section G.      The Adept, though withdrawn, shall have maintained the
             Extension of his Symbol.  He now repeats the signs as before,
             save that he makes the Passive Invoking Pentagram of Spirit.
             He concentrates {284} his consciousness within his Twin-Symbol
             of Self, and endeavours to send it to sleep.  But if the
             operation be performed properly, his Angel shall have accepted
             the offering of Dew, and seized with fervour upon the extended
             symbol of Will towards Himself.  This then shall He shake
             vehemently with vibrations of love reverberating with the
             Words of the Section.  Even in the physical ears of the adept
             there shall resound an echo thereof, yet he shall not be able
             to describe it.  It shall seem both louder than thunder, and
             softer than the whisper of the night-wind.  It shall at once
             be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard.
                Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to
             withstand the Will of his Angel, concealing himself in the
             closest cell of the citadel of consciousness.  Let him
             consecrate himself to resist the assault of the Voice and the
             Vibration until his consciousness faint away into Nothing.
             For if there abide unabsorbed even one single atom of the
             false Ego, that atom should stain the virginity of the True
             Self and profane the Oath; then that atom should be so
             inflamed by the approach of the Angel that it should overwhelm
             the rest of the mind, tyrannize over it, and become an insane
             despot to the total ruin of the realm.
                But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive
             against the Angel?  He shall intensify the stress of His
             Spirit so that His loyal legions of Lion-Serpents leap from
             the ambush, awakening the adept to witness their Will and
             sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that he
             consciously partakes their purpose, and sees in its simplicity
             the solution of all his perplexities.  Thus then shall the
             Adept be aware that he is being swept away through the column
             of his Will Symbol, {285} and that His Angel is indeed
             himself, with intimacy so intense as to become identity, and
             that not in a single Ego, but in every unconscious element
             that shares in that manifold uprush.
                This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant
             light, almost always, and also in many cases by an outburst of
             sound, stupendous and sublime in all cases, though its
             character may vary within wide limits.>
                The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-Symbol,
             and is scattered over the sky in glittering galaxies.  This
             dispersion destroys the concentration of the adept, whose mind
             cannot master such multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, he
             simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall nothing of his
             experience but a vague though vivid impression of complete
             release and ineffable rapture.  Repetition fortifies him to
             realise the nature of his attainment; and his Angel, the link
             once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be
             sensitive to his Holy presence, and persuasion.  But it may
             occur, especially after repeated success, that the Adept is
             not flung back into his mortality by the explosion of the
             Star-spate, but identified with one particular "Lion-Serpent",
             continuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper place
             in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, which
             the Adept may then take back to earth with him.
                This is but a side issue.  The main purpose of the Ritual
             is to establish the relation of the subconscious self with the
             Angel in such a way that the Adept is aware that his Angel is
             the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements of that
             Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies
             286} introduced by the accidents of environment, and that his
             Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys
             all doubts and delusions, confers all blessings, teaches all
             truth, and contains all delights.  But it is important that
             the Adept should not rest in mere inexpressible realization of
             his rapture, but rouse himself to make the relation submit to
             analysis, to render it in rational terms, and thereby
             enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to
             fanatical enthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African
             war-drums.

                            --------

Section Gg.     The adept should have realised that his Act of Union with
             the angel implies (1) the death of his old mind save in so far
             as his unconscious elements preserve its memory when they
             absorb it, and (2) the death of his unconscious elements
             themselves.  But their death is rather a going forth to renew
             their life through love.  He then, by conscious comprehension
             of them separately and together, becomes the "Angel" of his
             Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is
             Thunder.  Thus in this section the adept utters articulately
             so far as words may, what his Angel is to Himself.  He says
             this, with his Scin-Laeca wholly withdrawn into his physical
             body, constraining His Angel to indwell his heart.
"Line 1."         "I am He" asserts the destruction of the sense of
             separateness between self and Self.  It affirms existence, but
             of the third person only.  "The Bornless Spirit" is free of
             all space, "having sight in the feet", that they may choose
             their own path.  "Strong" is G B R, The Magician escorted by
             the Sun and the Moon (See Liber D and Liber 777).  The
             "Immortal Fire" is the creative Self; impersonal energy cannot
             perish, no matter what forms it assumes.  Combustion is Love.
             287
"Line 2."         "Truth" is the necessary relation of any two things;
             therefore, although it implies duality, it enables us to
             conceive of two things as being one thing such that it demands
             to be defined by complementals.  Thus, an hyperbola is a
             simple idea, but its construction exacts two curves.
"Line 3."         The Angel, as the adept knows him, is a being Tiphereth,
             which obscures Kether.  The Adept is not officially aware of
             the higher Sephiroth.  He cannot perceive, like the
             Ipsissimus, that all things soever are equally illusion and
             equally Absolute.  He is in Tiphereth, whose office is
             Redemption, and he deplores the events which have caused the
             apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped.  He is also
             aware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and
             defects of his Attainment.
"Line 4."         This refers to the phenomena which accompany his
             Attainment.
"Line 5."         This means the recognition of the Angel as the True Self of
             his subconscious self, the hidden Life of his physical life.
"Line 6."         The Adept realises every breath, every word of his Angel as
             charged with creative fire.  Tiphereth is the Sun, and the
             Angel is the spiritual Sun of the Soul of the Adept.
"Line 7."         Here is summed the entire process of bringing the
             conditioned Universe to knowledge of itself through the
             formula of generation>;
             a soul implants itself in sense-hoodwinked body and reason-
             fettered mind, makes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to
             partake of its own consciousness of the Light.
"Line 8."         "Grace" has here its proper sense of "Pleasantness".  {288}
             The existence of the Angel is the justification of the device
             of creation.>
"Line 9."         This line must be studied in the light of Liber LXV
             (Equinox XI. p. 65).

Section H.      This recapitulation demands the going forth together of the
             Adept and his Angel "to do their pleasure on the Earth among
             the living."

Section J.      The Beast 666 having devised the present method of using
             this Ritual, having proved it by his own practice to be of
             infallible puissance when properly performed, and now having
             written it down for the world, it shall be an ornament for the
             Adept who adopts it to cry Hail to His name at the end of his
             work.  This shall moreover encourage him in Magick, to recall
             that indeed there was One who attained by its use to the
             Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel, the
             which forsook him no more, but made Him a Magus, the Word of
             the Aeon of Horus!
                For know this, that the Name IAF in its most secret and
             mighty sense declareth the Formula of the Magick of the BEAST
             whereby he wrought many wonders.  And because he doth will
             that the whole world shall attain to this Art, He now hideth
             it herein so that the worthy may win to His Wisdom.
                Let I and F face all;> yet ward their A from attack.  The
             Hermit to himself, the Fool to foes, {289} The Hierophant to
             friends, Nine by nature, Naught by attainment, Five by
             function.  In speech swift, subtle and secret; in thought
             creative, unbiassed, unbounded; in act gentle, patient and
             persistent.  Hermes to hear, Dionysus to touch, Pan to behold.
                A Virgin, A Babe, and a Beast!
                A Liar, an Idiot, and a Master of Men!
                A kiss, a guffaw, and a bellow; he that hath ears to hear,
             let him hear!
                Take ten that be one, and one that is one in three, to
             conceal them in six!
                Thy wand to all Cups, and thy Disk to all Swords, but
             betray not thine Egg!
                Moreover also is IAF verily 666 by virtue of Number; and
             this is a Mystery of Mysteries; Who knoweth it, he is adept of
             adepts, and Mighty among Magicians!
                Now this word SABAF, being by number Three score and Ten,> is a
 name of Ayin, the
             Eye, and the Devil our Lord, and the Goat of Mendes.  He is
             the Lord of the Sabbath of the Adepts, and is Satan, therefore
             also the Sun, whose number of Magick is 666, the seal of His
             servant the BEAST.
                But again SA is 61, AIN, the Naught of Nuith; BA means go,
             for Hadit; and F is their Son the Sun who is Ra-Hoor-Khuit.
                So then let the Adept set his sigil upon all the words he
             hath writ in the Book of the Works of his Will.  {290}
                And let him then end all, saying, Such are the Words!>  For by
this he maketh proclamation
             before all them that be about his Circle that these
             Words are true and puissant, binding what he
             would bind, and loosing what he would loose.
                Let the Adept perform this Ritual aright, perfect in every
             part thereof, once daily for one moon, then twice, at dawn and
             dusk, for two moons, next, thrice, noon added, for three
             moons, afterwards, midnight making up his course, for four

             consecrated wholly to this Work; let him be instant in
             continual ardour, dismissing all but his sheer needs to eat
             and sleep.>  For know that the true

             Beast in this Attainment, was thus:

                               INVOKE OFTEN>

                So may all men come at last to the Knowledge and
             Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: thus sayeth the
             Beast, and prayeth His own Angel that this book be as a
             burning Lamp, and as a living Spring, for Light and Life to
             them that read therein.

(Note to page 291)
   The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this:
   "And when, by often invoking, all the phantasms are vanished, thou shalt see
 that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes through all the
 Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of the Fire!
   "A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or a Fire
formless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing Light abounding
, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud.  Also there is the vision of the fir
e-flashing Courser of Light, or also a Child, borne aloft on the shoulders of t
he Celestial Steed, fiery, or clothed with gold, or naked, or shooting with the
 bow shafts or light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse, then if thy m
editation prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into the form o
f a Lion."
   This passage --- combined with several others --- is paraphased in poetry by
 Aleister Crowley in his "Tannhauser".

        "And when, "invoking often," thou shalt see
        That formless Fire; when all the earth is shaken,
        The stars abide not, and the moon is gone,
        All Time crushed back into Eternity,
        The Universe by earthquake overtaken;
        Light is not, and the thunders roll,
        The World is done:
        When in the darkness Chaos rolls again
        In the excited brain:
        Then, O then call not to thy view that visible
        Image of Nature; fatal is her name!
        It fitteth not thy Body to behold
        That living light of Hell,
        The unluminous, dead flame,
        Until that body from the crucible
        Hath passed, pure gold!
        For, from the confines of material space,
        The twilight-moving place,
        The gates of matter, and the dark threshold,
        Before the faces of the Things that dwell
        In the Abodes of Night,
        Spring into sight
        Demons, dog-faced, that show no mortal sign
        Of Truth, but desecrate the Light Divine,
        Seducing from the sacred mysteries.
        But, after all these Folk of Fear are driven
        Before the avenging levin
        That rives the opening skies,
        Behold that formless and that Holy Flame {292}
        That hath no name;
        The Fire that darts and flashes, writhes and creeps
        Snake-wise in royal robe
        Wound round that vanished glory of the globe,
        Unto that sky beyond the starry deeps,
        Beyond the Toils of Time, --- then formulate
        In thine own mind, luminous, concentrate,
        The Lion of the Light, a child that stands
        On the vast shoulders of the Steed of God:
        Or winged, or shooting flying shafts, or shod
        With the flame-sandals.
                         Then, lift up thine hands!
        Centre thee in thine heart one scarlet thought
        Limpid with brilliance of the Light above!
        Drawn into naught
        All life, death, hatred, love:
        All self concentred in the sole desire ---
        Hear thou the Voice of Fire!"

                   SCHOLION ON SECTIONS G & Gg.


   The Adept who has mastered this Ritual, successfully realising the full impo
rt of this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to loosen its grip o
n the astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or Soul-symbol, or even to
 forget its duty to the body and the sensible surroundings.  Nor should he omit
 to keep his Body of Light in close touch with the phenomena of its own plane,
so that its privy consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting h
is scattered ideals from obsession.
   But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of detaching
these elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that they
become (temporarily) independent responsible units, capable of receiving commun
ications from headquarters at will, but perfectly able (1) to take care of them
selves without troubling their chief, and (2) to report to him at the proper ti
me.  In a figure, they must be like subordinate officers, expected to display s
elf-reliance, initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the D
ay.
   The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds of his
to control their own conditions without interference from himself for the time
required, and to recall them in due course, receiving an accurate report of the
ir adventures.
   This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that
part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of h
is Holy Guardian Angel.  The absence of his bodily, mental and astral conscious
ness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention
 which has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs
that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul.  {294}
   The effect of the Ritual has been
   (a) to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him
;
   (b) to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths;
   (c) to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anaesthet
ize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisectio
n, just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen ou
t the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire;
   (d) to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fl
ing them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; an
d
   (e) to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes
 Him.
   The method of the Ritual is thus manifold.
   There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate hi
s course of action.  He can decide what must be banished, what purified, what c
oncentrated.  He can then concentrate his will upon its one essential element,
over-coming its resistance --- which is automatic, like a physiological reflex
--- by destroying inhibitions through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm.>  The ot
her half of the work needs no such complex effort; for his Angel is simple and
unperplexed, ready at all times to respond to rightly ordered approach.  {295}
   But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid description
.  One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not reta
in any memory soever of what has occurred.  He may be merely aware of a gap in
his conscious life, and judge of its contents by observing that his nature has
been subtly transfigured.  Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perf
ection.
   If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that some p
art of his mind is prepared to realise the rapture, and to express it to itself
 in one way or another.  This involves the perfection of that part, its freedom
 from prejudice and the limitations of rationality so-called.  For instance: on
e could not receive the illumination as to the nature of life which the doctrin
e of evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuaded that humanity is e
ssentially not animal, or convinced that causality is repugnant to reason.  The
 Adept must be ready for the utter destruction of his point of view on any subj
ect, and even that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought.>
 Thus he may find that his Angel consider his "business" or his "love" to be ab
surd trifles; also that human ideas of "time" are invalid, and human "laws" of
logic applicable only to the relations between illusions.
   Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is sensitiv
e to His influence.  Such a point will naturally be one that is salient in the
Adept's character, and also one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pure>
.
   Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to {296} rece
ive a visual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is sublimely quin
tessential of his ideal.  A musician may be rapt away by majestic melodies such
 as he never hoped to hear.  A philosopher may attain apprehension of tremendou
s truths, the solution of problems that had baffled him all his life.
   Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations experienced by simp
le-minded men, such as a workman who "saw God" and likened Him to "a quantity o
f little pears".  Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging upon unbalanced minds,
 inflames the idolised idea, and produces fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy
, with intolerance and insanely disordered energy which is yet so powerful as t
o effect the destinies of empires.
   But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Ang
el are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy.  Their intimacy
(or rather identity) is independent of all partial forms of expression; at its
best it is therefore as inarticulate as Love.
   The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a cry,
some natural physical gesture of animal sympathy with the spiritual spasm.  Thi
s is to be criticised as incomplete self-control.  Silence is nobler.
   In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his Soul
is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect.
 It is evident that the stress of such spiritual possession must tend to overwh
elm the soul, especially at first.  It actually suffers from the excess of its
ecstasy, just as extreme love produces vertigo.  The soul sinks and swoons.  Su
ch weakness is fatal alike to its enjoyment and its apprehension.  "Be strong!
then canst thou bear more rapture!" sayeth the Book of the Law.>
   The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself to harden his soul.
   To this end, I, the Beast, have made trial and proof of divers devices.  Of
these the most potent is to set the body to strive with {297} the soul.  Let th
e muscles take grip on themselves as if one were wrestling.  Let the jaw and mo
uth, in particular, be tightened to the utmost.  Breathe deeply, slowly, yet st
rongly.  Keep mastery over the mind by muttering forcibly and audibly.  But les
t such muttering tend to disturb communion with the Angel, speak only His Name.
  Until the Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perf
ect possession of his Beloved.  His most important task is thus to open his ear
s to the voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called.  For heark
en! this Name, understood rightly and fully, declareth the nature of the Angel
in every point, wherefore also that Name is the formula of the perfection to wh
ich the Adept must aspire, and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he
 must work.
   He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a word worthy o
f this particular Ritual.  Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon, which si
gnifieth "The Great Work accomplished"; and Aumgn interpreted in Part III of Bo
ok 4>; and the name of THE BEAST, for that His number showeth forth this Union
with the Angel, and His Work is no other than to make all men partakers of this
 Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick.
   So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel and w
ithstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communion unt
il the consciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, and of accurate tr
ansmission> of the {298} transcendent Truth of the Beloved to the heart that ho
lds him.
   The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maint
ain the state of Union for several minutes, even at first.
   In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather as an
encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph.  He should increase
his efforts.
   Let him beware of the "lust of result", of expecting too much, of losing cou
rage if his first success is followed by a series of failures.
   For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create an in
hibition fatal to subsequent attempts.  One fears to fail; the fear intrudes up
on the concentration and so fulfils its own prophecy.  We know how too much ple
asure in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace oneself on the next few occ
asions; indeed, until familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one's lov
er has never supposed one to be more than human.  Confidence returns gradually.
  Inarticulate ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoyment of the elements of
 the fascination.
   Just so one's first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one continu
es to gaze, to the appreciation of exquisite details of the view.  At first the
y were blurred by the blinding rush of general beauty; they emerge one by one a
s the shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields to intelligent interest.
   In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics painting
 out mystical extravagances about "ineffable love", "unimaginable bliss", "inex
pressible infinities of illimitable utterness".>  He usually loses his sense of
 proportion, of humour, of reality, and of sound judgment.  His ego is often in
flated to the bursting point, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were n
ot so pitifully dangerous to himself and others.  He also tends to take his new
-found "truths of illumination" for the entire body of truth, and insists that
they must be as valid an vital for all men as they happen to be for himself.  {
299}
   It is wise to keep silence about those things "unlawful to utter" which one
may have heard "in the seventh heaven".  This may not apply to the sixth.
   The Adept must keep himself in hand, however tempted to make a new heaven an
d a new earth in the next few days by trumpeting his triumphs.  He must give ti
me a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the impact of the Infinite.
   As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find his passi
onate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility which adds power,
while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral qualities instead of obscur
ing and upsetting them.  He will by now have become able to converse with his A
ngel, impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm of sound wh
ich he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions.  Th
e "infinity" nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his
 limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only call the
m "many".
   The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of the Adep
t, is perfectly definite and precise.  It does not deal in ambiguities and abst
ractions.  It possesses form, and confesses law, in exactly the same way and de
gree as any other body of truth.  It is to the truth of the material and intell
ectual spheres of man very much what the Mathematics of Philosophy with its "in
finite series" and "Cantorian continuity" is to schoolboy arithmetic.  Each imp
lies the other, though by that one may explore the essential nature of existenc
e, and by this a pawnbroker's profits.
   This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to assimilat
e himself to his Angel by continual conscious communion.  For his Angel is an i
ntelligible image of his own true Will, to do which is the whole of the law of
his Being.
   Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, which is the heart of the Ruach, and
thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind.  It is also directly inspired from Keth
er, the ultimate Self, through the Path of the High Priestess, or initiated int
uition.  Hence the Angel is in truth the Logos or articulate expression of the
whole Being of the Adept, so that as he increases in the perfect understanding
of {300} His name, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, Who he h
imself truly is.
   Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him; for the
 Tiphereth-consciousness alone is connected by paths with the various parts of
his mind.>  None therefore save He hath the knowledge requisite for calculating
 the combinations of conduct which will organise and equilibrate the forces of
the Adept, against the moment when it becomes necessary to confront the Abyss.
 The Adept must control a compact and coherent mass if he is to make sure of hu
rling it from him with a clean-cut gesture.
   I, The Beast 666, lift up my voice and swear that I myself have been brought
 hither by mine Angel.  After that I had attained unto the Knowledge and Conver
sation of Him by virtue of mine ardour towards Him, and of this Ritual that I b
estow upon men my fellows, and most of His great Love that He beareth to me, ye
a, verily, He led me to the Abyss; He bade me fling away all that I had and all
 that I was; and He forsook me in that Hour.  But when I came beyond the Abyss,
 to be reborn within the womb of BABALON, then came he unto me abiding in my vi
rgin heart, its Lord and Lover!
   Also He made me a Magus, speaking through His Law, the Word of the new Aeon,
 the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child.> Thus he fulfilled my will to br
ing full freedom to the race of Men.
   Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of wonder beyond this, but in this matter
I am sworn to hold my peace.

                          THE STAR RUBY.

   Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy mouth
 with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip.  Then dashing down the
hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thy breath, cry  GR:Al
pha-Pi-Omicron  GR:Pi-Alpha-Nu-Tau-Omicron-Sigma  GR:Kappa-Alpha-Kappa-Omicron-
Delta-Alpha-Iota-Mu-Omicron-Nu-Omicron-Sigma.
   With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say  GR:Sigma-Omicron-Iota,
 thy member, and say  GR:Omega  GR:Phi-Alpha-Lambda-Lambda-Epsilon>, thy right
shoulder, and say  GR:Iota-Sigma-Chi-Upsilon-Rho-Omicron-Sigma, thy left should
er, and say  GR:Epsilon-Upsilon-Chi-Alpha-Rho-Iota-Sigma-Tau-Omicron-Sigma; the
n clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, and cry  GR:Iota-Alpha-Omega.  Advanc
e to the East.  Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy forehead.  Drawing
 the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus and roar
 GR:Theta-Eta-Rho-Iota-Omicron-Nu.  Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-
Kraat.
   Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.
   Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.
   Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.
   Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice
in the Paian, with these words  GR:Iota-Omega  GR:Pi-Alpha-Nu, with the signs o
f N.O.X.
   Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear:

                             LIBER XXXVI

                          THE STAR SAPPHIRE.


   Let the Adept be armed with his Magick Rood [and provided with his mystic Ro
se].
   In the centre, let him give the L.V.X. signs; or if he know them, if he will
 and dare do them, and can keep silent about them, the signs of N.O.X. being th
e signs of Puer, Vir, Puella, Mulier.  Omit the sign. I.R.
   Then let him advance to the East and make the Holy Hexagram, saying: "Pater
et Mater unus deus Ararita."
   Let him go round to the South, make the Holy Hexagram and say: "Mater et Fil
ius unus deus Ararita."
   Let him go round to the North, make the Holy Hexagram and then say: "Filia e
t Pater unus deus Ararita."
   Let him then return to the Centre, and so to The Centre of All (making the "
Rosy Cross" as he may know how) saying "Ararita Ararita Ararita". (In this the
Signs shall be those of Set Triumphant and of Baphomet.  Also shall Set appear
in the Circle.  Let him drink of the Sacrament and let him communicate the same
.)  Then let him say:  "Omnia in Duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Qua
tuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.
   Gloria Patri et Matri et Filio et Filiae et Spiritui Sancto externo et Spiri
tui Sancto interno ut erat est erit in saecula Saeculorum sex in uno per nomen
Septem in uno Ararita."
   Let him then repeat the signs of L.V.X. but not the signs of N.O.X.: for it
is not he that shall arise in the Sign of Isis Rejoicing.

                              LIBER XLIV

                       THE MASS OF THE PHOENIX

 "The Magician, his breast bare, stands before an altar on which are his Burin,
 Bell, Thurible, and two of the Cakes of Light.  In the Sign of the Enterer he
reaches West across the Altar, and cries:"
   Hail Ra, that goest in thy bark
   Into the caverns of the Dark! "He gives the sign of Silence, and takes the B
ell, and Fire, in his hands."
   East of the Altar see me stand
   With light and musick in my hand! "He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell" 33
3 - 55555 - 333 "and places the Fire in the Thurible."
   I strike the Bell: I light the Flame;
   I utter the mysterious Name.
                        ABRAHADABRA "He strikes eleven times upon the Bell."
   Now I begin to pray: Thou Child,
   Holy Thy name and undefiled!
   Thy reign is come; Thy will is done.
   Here is the Bread; here is the Blood.
   Bring me through midnight to the Sun!
   Save me from Evil and from Good!
   That Thy one crown of all the Ten
   Even now and here be mine.  AMEN. "He puts the first Cake on the Fire of the
 Thurible."
   I burn the Incense-cake, proclaim
   These adorations of Thy name. "He makes them as in Liber Legis, and strikes
again Eleven times upon the Bell.  With the Burin he then makes upon his breast
 the proper sign."  {329}

   Behold this bleeding breast of mine
   Gashed with the sacramental sign!

"He puts the second Cake to the wound."

   I stanch the Blood; the wafer soaks
   It up, and the high priest invokes!

"He eats the second Cake."

   This Bread I eat.  This Oath I swear
   As I enflame myself with prayer:
   "There is no grace: there is no guilt:
   This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!"

"He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell, and cries"

                          ABRAHADABRA.

   I entered in with woe; with mirth
   I now go forth, and with thanksgiving,
   To do my pleasure on the earth
   Among the legions of the living.

"He goeth forth."

  1. Let the Magician, still facing Boleskine, advance to the
     circumference of his circle.

     stealth and swiftness of a tiger the precincts of his circle,

     passeth, so to project the force that radiateth from Boleskine

  5. Let him trace with his wand the Averse Pentagram proper

  8. Let him turn again to the left, and pursue his Path as

     horizontally extended in the line joining the shoulders.
     Let his left hand, the thumb extended forwards and the
     fingers clenched, rest at the junction of the thighs (Attitude

 12. Let him proceed as before; then in the East, let him make
     the Averse Pentagram that invoketh Earth (Taurus).
 13. Let him point his wand to the centre of the pentagram,
     and cry, THERION!
 14. Let him give the sign called Vir, the feet being together.
     The hands, with clenched finger and thumbs thrust out
     forwards, are held to the temples; the head is then bowed
     and pushed out, as if to symbolize the butting of an horned
     beast (attitude of Pan, Bacchus, etc.).  (Frontispiece,
     Equinox I, III).
 15. Proceeding as before, let him make in the West the
     Averse Pentagram whereby Water is invoked.
 16. Pointing the wand to the centre of the Pentagram, let him
     call upon BABALON!!

     Welcome, the Microcosm of Vitruvius).  (See Book 4,
     Part II).  {333}
 18. Let him break into the dance, tracing a centripetal spiral

 21. Let him lower the wand, striking the Earth therewith.
 22. Let him give the sign of Mater Triumphans (The feet are
     together; the left arm is curved as if it supported a child;
     the thumb and index finger of the right hand pinch the
     nipple of the left breast, as if offering it to that child).
     Let him utter the word  GR:Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha!
 23. Perform the spiral dance, moving deosil and whirling
     widdershins.
     Each time on passing the West extend the wand to the
     Quarter in question, and bow:
a. "Before me the powers of LA!" (to West.)
b. "Behind me the powers of AL!" (to East.)
c. "On my right hand the powers of LA!" (to North.)
d. "On my left hand the powers of AL!" (to South.)
e. "Above me the powers of ShT!" (leaping in the air.)
f. "Beneath me the powers of ShT!" (striking the ground.)
g. "Within me the Powers!" (in the attitude of Phthah erect, the
       feet together, the hands clasped upon the vertical wand.)
h. "About me flames my Father's face, the Star of Force and
       Fire."
i. "And in the Column stands His six-rayed Splendour!"
   (This dance may be omitted, and the whole utterance chanted in the attitude
of Phthah.)

                      The FINAL GESTURE.

   This is identical with the First Gesture.

   (Here followeth an impression of the ideas implied in this Paean.)  {334}

   I also am a Star in Space, unique and self-existent, an individual essence i
ncorruptible; I also am one Soul; I am identical with All and None.  I am in Al
l and all in Me; I am, apart from all and lord of all, and one with all.
   I am a God, I very God of very God; I go upon my way to work my will; I have
 made matter and motion for my mirror; I have decreed for my delight that Nothi
ngness should figure itself as twain, that I might dream a dance of names and n
atures, and enjoy the substance of simplicity by watching the wanderings of my
shadows.  I am not that which is not; I know not that which knows not; I love n
ot that which loves not.  For I am Love, whereby division dies in delight; I am
 Knowledge, whereby all parts, plunged in the whole, perish and pass into perfe
ction; and I am that I am, the being wherein Being is lost in Nothing, nor deig
ns to be but by its Will to unfold its nature, its need to express its perfecti
on in all possibilities, each phase a partial phantasm, and yet inevitable and
absolute.
   I am Omniscient, for naught exists for me unless I know it.  I am Omnipotent
, for naught occurs save by Necessity my soul's expression through my will to b
e, to do, to suffer the symbols of itself.  I am Omnipresent, for naught exists
 where I am not, who fashioned space as a condition of my consciousness of myse
lf, who am the centre of all, and my circumference the frame of mine own fancy.
   I am the All, for all that exists for me is a necessary expression in though
t of some tendency of my nature, and all my thoughts are only the letters of my
 Name.
   I am the One, for all that I am is not the absolute all, and all my all is m
ine and not another's; mine, who conceive of others like myself in essence and
truth, yet unlike in expression and illusion.
   I am the None, for all that I am is the imperfect image of the perfect; each
 partial phantom must perish in the clasp of its counterpart; each form fulfil
itself by finding its equated opposite, and satisfying its need to be the Absol
ute by the attainment of annihilation.
   The word, LAShTAL includes all this.
   "LA" --- Naught.  {335}
   "AL" --- Two.
   "L" is "Justice", the Kteis fulfilled by the Phallus, "Naught and Two" becau
se the plus and the minus have united in "love under will."
   "A" is "the Fool", Naught in Thought (Parzival), Word (Harpocrates), and Act
ion (Bacchus).  He is the boundless air, the wandering Ghost, but with "possibi
lities".  He is the Naught that the Two have made by "love under will".
   "LA" thus represents the Ecstasy of Nuit and Hadit conjoined, lost in love,
and making themselves Naught thereby.  Their child is begotten and conceived, b
ut is in the phase of Naught also, as yet.  "LA" is thus the Universe in that p
hase, with its potentialities of manifestation.
   "AL" on the contarary, though it is essentially identical with "LA", shows t
he Fool manifested through the Equilibrium of Contraries.  The weight is still
nothing, but it is expressed as if it were two equal weights in opposite scales
.  The indicator still points to zero.
   "ShT" is equally 31 with "LA" and "AL", but it expresses the secret nature w
hich operates the Magick or the transmutations.
   "ShT" is the formula of this particular aeon; another aeon might have anothe
r way of saying 31.
   "Sh" is Fire as T is Force; conjoined they express Ra-Hoor-Khuit.
   "The Angel" represents the Stele 666, showing the Gods of the Aeon, while "S
trength" is a picture of Babalon and The Beast, the earthly emissaries of those
 Gods.
   "ShT" is the dynamic equivalent of "LA" and "AL".  "Sh" shows the Word of th
e Law, being triple, as 93 is thrice 31.  "T" shows the formula of Magick decla
red in that Word; the Lion, the Serpent, the Sun, Courage and Sexual Love are a
ll indicated by the card.
   In "LA" note that Saturn or Satan is exalted in the House of Venus or Astart
e, and it is an airy sign.  Thus "L" is Father-Mother, Two and Naught, and the
Spirit (Holy Ghost) of their Love is also Naught.  Love is AHBH, 13, which is A
ChD, Unity, I, Aleph, who is The Fool who is Naught, but none the less an Indiv
idual One, who (as such) is not another, yet unconscious of himself until his O
neness expresses itself as a duality.
   Any impression or idea is unknowable in itself.  It can mean {336} nothing u
ntil brought into relation with other things.  The first step is to distinguish
 one thought from another; this is the condition of recognizing it.  To define
it, we must perceive its orientation to all our other ideas.  The extent of our
 knowledge of any one thing varies therefore with the number of ideas with whic
h we can compare it.  Every new fact not only adds itself to our universe, but
increases the value of what we already possess.
   In "AL" this "The" or "God" arranges for "Contenance to behold contenance",
by establishing itself as an equilibrium, "A" the One-Naught conceived as "L" t
he Two-Naught.  This "L" is the Son-Daughter Horus-Harpocrates just as the othe
r "L" was the Father-Mother Set-Isis.  Here then is Tetragrammaton once more, b
ut expressed in identical equations in which every term is perfect in itself as
 a mode of Naught.
   "ShT" supplies the last element; making the Word of either five or six lette
rs, according as we regard "ShT" as one letter or two.  Thus the Word affirms t
he Great Work accomplished: 5 Degree = 6Square.
   "ShT", is moreover a necessary resolution of the apparent opposition of "LA"
 and "AL"; for one could hardly pass to the other without the catalytic action
of a third identical expression whose function should be to transmute them.  Su
ch a term must be in itself a mode of Naught, and its nature cannot encroach on
 the perfections of Not-Being, "LA" or of Being, "AL".  It must be purely Nothi
ng-Matter, so as to create a Matter-in-Motion which is a function of "Something
".
   Thus "ShT" is Motion in its double phase, an inertia composed of two opposit
e currents, and each current is also thus polarized.  "Sh" is Heaven and Earth,
 "T" Male and Female; "ShT" is Spirit and Matter; one is the word of Liberty an
d Love flashing its Light to restore Life to Earth; the other is the act by whi
ch Life claims that Love is Light and Liberty.  And these are Two-in-One, the d
ivine letter of Silence-in-Speech whose symbol is the Sun in the arms of the Mo
on.
   But "Sh" and "T" are alike formulae of force in action as opposed to entitie
s; they are not states of existence, but modes of motion.  They are verbs, not
nouns.
   "Sh" is the Holy Spirit as a "tongue of fire" manifest in triplicity, {337}
and is the child of Set-Isis as their Logos or Word uttered by their "Angel".
The card is XX, and 20 is the value of Yod (the Angel or Herald) expressed in f
ull as IVD.  "Sh" is the Spiritual congress of Heaven and Earth.
   But "T" is the Holy Spirit in action as a "roaring lion" or as the "old Serp
ent" instead of as an "Angel of Light".  The twins of Set-Isis, harlot and beas
t, are busy with that sodomitic and incestuous lust which is the traditional fo
rmula for producing demi-gods, as in the cases of Mary and the Dove; Leda and t
he Swan, etc.  The card is XI, the number of Magick AVD: Aleph the Fool impregn
ating the woman according to the word of Yod, the Angel of the Lord!  His siste
r has seduced her brother Beast, shaming the Sun with her sin; she has mastered
 the Lion and enchanted the Serpent.  Nature is outraged by Magick; man is best
ialized and woman defiled.  The conjunction produces a monster; it affirms regr
ession of types.  Instead of a man-God conceived of the Spirit of God by a virg
in in innocence, we are asked to adore the bastard of a whore and a brute, bego
tten in shamefullest sin and born in most blasphemous bliss.
   This is in fact the formula of our Magick; we insist that all acts must be e
qual; that existence asserts the right to exist; that unless evil is a mere ter
m expressing some relation of haphazard hostility between forces equally self-j
ustified, the universe is as inexplicable and impossible as uncompensated actio
n: that the orgies of Bacchus and Pan are no less sacremental than the Masses o
f Jesus; that the scars of syphilis are sacred and worthy of honour as such.
   It should be unnecessary to insist that the above ideas apply only to the Ab
solute.  Toothache is still painful, and deceit degrading, to a man, relatively
 to his situation in the world of illusion; he does his Will by avoiding them.
 But the existence of "Evil" is fatal to philosophy so long as it is supposed t
o be independent of conditions; and to accustom the mind "to make no difference
" between any two ideas as such is to emancipate it from the thralldom of terro
r.
   We affirm on our altars our faith in ourselves and our wills, our love of al
l aspects of the Absolute All.  {338}
   And we make the Spirit Shin combine with the Flesh Teth into a single letter
, whose value is 31 even as those of "LA" the Naught, and "AL" the All, to comp
lete their Not-Being and Being with its Becoming, to mediate between identical
extremes as their mean --- the secret that sunders and seals them.
   It declares that all somethings are equally shadows of Nothing, and justifie
s Nothing in its futile folly of pretending that something is stable, by making
 us aware of a method of Magick through the practice of which we may partake in
 the pleasure of the process.
   The Magician should devise for himself a definite technique for destroying "
evil".  The essence of such a practice will consist in training the mind and th
e body to confront things which cause fear, pain, disgust,> shame and the like.
  He must learn to endure them, then to become indifferent to them, then to ana
lyse them until they give pleasure and instruction, and finally to appreciate t
hem for their own sake, as aspects of Truth.  When this has been done, he shoul
d abandon them if they are really harmful in relation to health or comfort.  Al
so, our selection of "evils" is limited to those that cannot damage us irrepara
bly.  E.g., one ought to practise smellying assafoetida until one likes it; but
 not arsine or hydrocyanic acid.  Again, one might have a liaison with an ugly
old woman until one beheld and loved the star which she is; it would be too dan
gerous to overcome the distaste for dishonesty by forcing oneself to pick pocke
ts.  Acts which are essentially dishonourable must not be done; they should be
justified only by calm contemplation of their correctness in abstract cases.
   Love is a virtue; it grows stronger and purer and less selfish by applying i
t to what it loathes; but theft is a vice involving the slave-idea that one's n
eighbour is superior to oneself.  It is admirable only for its power to develop
 certain moral and mental qualities in primitive types, to prevent the atrophy
of such faculties as our own vigilance, and for the interest which it adds to t
he "tragedy, Man."  {339}
   Crime, folly, sickness and all such phenomena must be contemplated with comp
lete freedom from fear, aversion, or shame.  Otherwise we shall fail to see acc
urately, and interpret intelligently; in which case we shall be unable to outwi
t and outfight them.  Anatomists and physiologists, grappling in the dark with
death, have won hygiene, surgery, prophylaxis and the rest for mankind.  Anthro
pologists, archaeologists, physicists and other men of science, risking thumbsc
rew, stake, infamy and ostracism, have torn the spider-snare of superstition to
 shreds and broken in pieces the monstrous idol of Morality, the murderous Molo
ch which has made mankind its meat throughout history.  Each fragment of that c
oprolite is manifest as an image of some brute lust, some torpid dullness, some
 ignorant instinct, or some furtive fear shapen in his own savage mind.
   Man is indeed not wholly freed, even now.  He is still trampled under the ho
ofs of the stampeding mules that nightmare bore to his wild ass, his creative f
orces that he had not mastered, the sterile ghosts that he called gods.  Their
mystery cows men still; they fear, they flinch, they dare not face the phantoms
.  Still, too, the fallen fetich seems awful; it is frightful to them that ther
e is no longer an idol to adore with anthems, and to appease with the flesh of
their firstborn.  Each scrambles in the bloody mire of the floor to snatch some
 scrap for a relic, that he may bow down to it and serve it.
   So, even to-day, a mass of maggots swarm heaving over the carrion earth, a b
rotherhood bound by blind greed for rottenness.  Science still hesitates to raz
e the temple of Rimmon, though every year finds more of her sons impatient of N
aaman's prudence.  The Privy Council of the Kingdom of Mansoul sits in permanen
t secret session; it dares not declare what must follow its deed in shattering
the monarch morality into scraps of crumbling conglomerate of climatic, tribal,
 and personal prejudices, corrupted yet more by the action of crafty ambition,
insane impulse, ignorant arrogance, superstitious hysteria, fear fashioning fal
sehoods on the stone that it sets on the grave of Truth whom it has murdered an
d buried in the black earth Oblivion.  Moral philosophy, psychology, sociology,
 anthropology, mental pathology, physiology, and many another of {340} the chil
dren of wisdom, of whom she is justified, well know that the laws of Ethics are
 a chaos of confused conventions, based at best on customs convenient in certai
n conditions, more often on the craft or caprice of the biggest, the most savag
e, heartless, cunning and blood-thirsty brutes of the pack, to secure their pow
er or pander to their pleasure in cruelty.  There is no principle, even a false
 one, to give coherence to the clamour of ethical propositions.  Yet the very m
en that have smashed Moloch, and strewn the earth with shapeless rubble, grow p
ale when they so much as whisper among themselves, "While Moloch ruled all men
were bound by the one law, and by the oracles of them that, knowing the fraud,
feared not, but were his priests and wardens of his mystery.  What now?  How ca
n any of us, though wise and strong as never was known, prevail on men to act i
n concert, now that each prays to his own chip of God, and yet knows every othe
r chip to be a worthless ort, dream-dust, ape-dung, tradition-bone, or --- what
 not else?"
   So science begins to see that the Initiates were maybe not merely silly and
selfish in making their rule of silence, and in protecting philosophy from the
profane.  Yet still she hopes that the mischief may not prove mortal, and begs
that things may go on much as usual until that secret session decide on some pl
an of action.
   It has always been fatal when somebody finds out too much too suddenly.  If
John Huss had cackled more like a hen, he might have survived Michaelmas, and b
een esteemed for his eggs.  The last fifty years have laid the axe of analysis
to the root of every axiom; they are triflers who content themselves with loppi
ng the blossoming twigs of our beliefs, or the boughs of our intellectual instr
uments.  We can no longer assert any single proposition, unless we guard oursel
ves by enumerating countless conditions which must be assumed.
   This digression has outstayed its welcome; it was only invited by Wisdom tha
t it might warn Rashness of the dangers that encompass even Sincerity, Energy a
nd Intelligence when they happen not to contribute to Fitness-in-their-environm
ent.
   The Magician must be wary in his use of his powers; he must make every act n
ot only accord with his Will, but with the proprieties of his position at the t
ime.  It might be my will to reach {341} the foot of a cliff; but the easiest w
ay --- also the speediest, most direct, least obstructed, the way of minimum ef
fort --- would be simply to jump.  I should have destroyed my will in the act o
f fulfilling it, or what I mistook for it; for the true will has no goal; its n
ature being to Go.  Similarly a parabola is bound by one law which fixes its re
lations with two straight lines at every point; yet it has no end short of infi
nity, and it continually changes its direction.  The initiate who is aware Who
he is can always check his conduct by reference to the determinants of his curv
e, and calculate his past, his future, his bearings and his proper course at an
y assigned moment; he can even comprehend himself as a simple idea.  He may att
ain to measure fellow-parabolas, ellipses that cross his path, hyperbolas that
span all space with their twin wings.  Perhaps he may come at long last, leapin
g beyond the limits of his own law, to conceive that sublimely stupendous outra
ge to Reason, the Cone!  Utterly inscrutable to him, he is yet well aware that
he exists in the nature thereof, that he is necessary thereto, that he is order
ed thereby, and that therefrom he is sprung, from the loins of so fearful a Fat
her!  His own infinity becomes zero in relation to that of the least fragment o
f the solid.  He hardly exists at all.  Trillions multiplied by trillions of tr
illions of such as he could not cross the frontier even of breadth, the idea wh
ich he came to guess at only because he felt himself bound by some mysterious p
ower.  Yet breadth is equally a nothing in the presence of the Cone.  His first
 conception must evidently be a frantic spasm, formless, insane, not to be clas
sed as articulate thought.  Yet, if he develops the faculties of his mind, the
more he knows of it the more he sees that its nature is identical with his own
whenever comparison is possible.
   The True Will is thus both determined by its equations, and free because tho
se equations are simply its own name, spelt out fully.  His sense of being unde
r bondage comes from his inability to read it; his sense that evil exists to th
wart him arises when he begins to learn to read, reads wrong, and is obstinate
that his error is an improvement.
   We know one thing only.  Absolute existence, absolute motion, absolute direc
tion, absolute simultaneity, absolute truth, all such {342} ideas; they have no
t, and never can have, any real meaning.  If a man in delirium tremens fell int
o the Hudson River, he might remember the proverb and clutch at an imaginary st
raw.  Words such as "truth" are like that straw.  Confusion of thought is conce
aled, and its impotence denied, by the invention.  This paragraph opened with,
"We know"; yet, questioned, "we" make haste to deny the possibility of possessi
ng, or even of defining, knowledge.  What could be more certain to a parabola-p
hilolsopher than that he could be approached in two ways, and two only?  It wou
ld be indeed little less than the whole body of his knowledge, implied in the t
heory of his definition of himself, and confirmed by every single experience.
He could receive impressions only by meeting A, or being caught up by B.  Yet h
e would be wrong in an infinite number of ways.  There are therefore Aleph-Zero
 possibilities that at any moment a man may find himself totally transformed.
And it may be that our present dazzled bewilderment is due to our recognition o
f the existence of a new dimension of thought, which seems so "inscrutably infi
nite" and "absurd" and "immoral", etc. --- because we have not studied it long
enough to appreciate that its laws are identical with our own, though extended
to new conceptions.  The discovery of radioactivity created a momentary chaos i
n chemistry and physics; but it soon led to a fuller interpretation of the old
ideas.  It dispersed many difficulties, harmonized many discords, and --- yea,
more!  It shewed the substance of the Universe as a simplicity of Light and Lif
e, possessed of limitless liberty to enjoy Love by combining its units in vario
us manners to compose atoms, themselves capable of deeper self-realization thro
ugh fresh complexities and organizations, each with its own peculiar powers and
 pleasures, each pursuing its path through the world where all things are possi
ble.  It revealed the omnipresence of Hadit identical with Himself, yet fulfill
ing Himself by dividing his interplay with Nuit into episodes, each form of his
 energy isolated with each aspect of Her receptivity, delight developing deligh
t continuous from complex to complex.  It was the voice of Nature awakening at
the dawn of the Aeon, as Aiwaz uttered the Word of the Law of Thelema.  {343}
   So also shall he who invoketh often behold the Formless Fire, with trembling
 and bewilderment; but if he prolong his meditation, he shall resolve it into c
oherent and intelligible symbols, and he shall hear the articulate utterance of
 that Fire, interpret the thunder thereof as a still small voice in his heart.
 And the Fire shall reveal to his eyes his own image in its own true glory; and
 it shall speak in his ears the Mystery that is his own right Name.
   This then is the virtue of the Magick of The Beast 666, and the canon of its
 proper usage: to destroy the tendency to discriminate between any two things i
n theory, and in practice to pierce the veils of every sanctuary, pressing forw
ard to embrace every image; for there is none that is not very Isis.  The Inmos
t is one with the Inmost; yet the form of the One is not the form of the other;
 intimacy exacts fitness.  He therefore who liveth by air, let him not be bold
to breathe water.  But mastery cometh by measure: to him who with labour, coura
ge, and caution giveth his life to understand all that doth encompass him, and
to prevail against it, shall be increase. "The word of Sin is Restriction"; see
k therefore Righteousness, enquiring into Iniquity, and fortify thyself to over
come it.

   In the East, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is situated on th
e south-eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles east of Foyers, is a
shrine or High Altar.  Its dimensions should be 7 feet in length, 3 feet in bre
adth, 44 inches in height.  It should be covered with a crimson altar-cloth, on
 which may be embroidered fleur-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitabl
e emblem.
   On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with countercharges in bla
ck and white.
   Below it should be the dias of three steps, in black and white squares.
   Above it is the super-altar, at whose top is the Stele of Revealing in repro
duction, with four candles on each side of it.  Below the stele is a place for
the Book of the Law, with six candles on each side of it.  Below this again is
the Holy Graal, with roses on each side of it.  There is room in front of the C
up for the Paten.  On each side beyond the roses are two great candles.
    All this is enclosed within a great veil.
   Forming the apex of an equilateral triangle whose base is a line drawn betwe
en the pillars, is a small black square altar, of two superimposed cubes.
   Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar and equal triangle,
 at the apex of this second triangle is a small circular font.
   Repeating, the apex of a third triangle is an upright tomb.  {345}

   The DEACON.  He is clothed in white and yellow.  He bears the Book of the La

   "The" DEACON, "opening the door of the Temple, admits the congregation and t
akes his stand between the small altar and the font.  (There should be a door-k
eeper to attend to the admission.)"
   "The" DEACON "advances and bows before the open shrine where the Graal is ex
alted.  He kisses the Book of the Law three times, opens it, and places it upon
 the super-altar.  He turns West."
   The DEACON.  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.  I proclaim th
e Law of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty in the name of
 GR:Iota-Alpha-Omega.
   The CONGREGATION.  Love is the law, love under will.
   "The" DEACON "goes to his place between the altar of incense and the font, f
aces East, and gives the step and sign of a Man and a Brother.  All imitate him
."
   The DEACON and all the PEOPLE.  I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD;
and in one Star in the company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to wh

 {346} CHAOS, the sole viceregent of the Sun upon Earth; and in one Air the nou

   And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein al

   And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in his name B
APHOMET.
   And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Love and Liberty,
 the Word of whose Law is  GR:Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha.
   And I believe in the communion of Saints.
   And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual s
ubstance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.
   And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle of Inc
arnation.
   And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is
to come.

"Music is now played.  The child enters with the ewer and the salt.  The "VIRGI

   The PRIEST.  How should I be worthy to administer the virtues to the Brethre

   "The "PRIESTESS "takes from the child the water and the salt, and mixes them

   "The "DEACON "brings the crown from the High Altar.  (The" {348} "crown may
be of gold or platinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no other metals, save
the small proportions necessary to a proper alloy.  It may be adorned with dive

   The thumb of the "PRIEST "is always between his index and" {349} "medius, wh
enever he is not holding the Lance.  The "PRIEST "takes the censer from the chi
ld, and makes five crosses as before.
   The children replace their weapons on their respective altars.
   The "PRIEST "kisses the Book of the Law three times.  He kneels for a space
in adoration, with joined hands, knuckles closed, thumb in position as aforesai
d.  He rises and draws the veil over the whole altar.  All rise and stand to or
der.
   The "PRIEST "takes the lance from the "DEACON "and holds it as before, as Os
iris or Phthah.  He circumambulates the Temple three times, followed by the "DE
ACON "and the children as before.  (These, when not using their hands, keep the
ir arms crossed upon their breasts.)  At the last circumambulation they leave h
im and go to the place between the font and the small altar, where they kneel i
n adoration, their hands joined palm to palm, and raised above their heads.
   All imitate this motion.
   The "PRIEST "returns to the East and mounts the first step of the Altar."
   The PRIEST.  O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but the younger brother
, marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, before whom Time is ashame
d, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may we attain
, unless Thine image be Love.  Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and
leaf and flower and fruit we do invoke Thee.
   "Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely
 brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling per
fume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men
speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, si
nce thou art continuous!"
   "During this speech the "PRIESTESS "must have divested herself completely of
 her robe, See CCXX.I.62."
   The PRIESTESS.  "But to love me is better than all things: if under the nigh
t-stars in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking m
e with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to
 lie in my bosom.  For one {350} kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; bu
t whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour.  Ye shall gathe
r goods and store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exce
ed the nations of the earth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me,
 and so shall ye come to my joy.  I charge you earnestly to come before me in a
 single robe, and covered with a rich headdress.  I love you!  I yearn to you!
 Pale or purple, veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and dr
unkenness of the innermost sense, desire you.  Put on the wings, and arouse the
 coiled splendour within you: come unto me!"  To me!  To me!  "Sing the rapturo
us love-song unto me!  Burn to me perfumes!  Wear to me jewels!  Drink to me, f
or I love you!  I love you!  I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am the
naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky.  To me!  To me!"
   "The "PRIEST "mounts the second step."
   The PRIEST.  O secret of secrets that art hidden in the being of all that li
ves, not Thee do we adore, for that which adoreth is also Thou.  Thou art that,
 and That am I.
   "I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every s
tar.  I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me th
e knowledge of death."  "I am alone: there is no God where I am."
   "(The "DEACON "and all rise to their feet with Hailing Sign.)"
   The DEACON.  "But ye, o my people, rise up & awake!  Let the rituals be righ
tly performed with joy & beauty!"
   "There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times."
   "A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride!"
   "A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law."
   "A feast for Tahuti and the child of the Prophet-secret, O Prophet!"
   "A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods."
   "A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feas
t for death!"
   "A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!" {351}
   "A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight!"
   "(The "PRIEST "mounts the third step.)"
   The PRIEST:  Thou that art One, our Lord in the Universe, the Sun, our Lord
in ourselves whose name is Mystery of Mystery, uttermost being whose radiance,
enlightening the worlds, is also the breath that maketh every God even and Deat
h to tremble before thee --- by the Sign of Light appear thou glorious upon the
 throne of the Sun.
   Make open the path of creation and of intelligence between us and our minds.

   "I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the Year, in the dusk of the E
quinox of Osiris, when first I beheld thee visibly; when first the dreadful iss
ue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One charmed away the strife.  I remembe
r thy first kiss, even as a maiden should.  Nor in the dark byways was there an
other: thy kisses abide."  --- LIBER LAPIDIS LAZULI. VII. 15. 16.
   0. Be seated in thine Asana, wearing the robe of a Neophyte, the hood drawn.
   1. It is night, heavy and hot, there are no stars.  Not one breath of wind s
tirs the surface of the sea, that is thou.  No fish play in thy depths.
   2. Let a Breath rise and ruffle the waters.  This also thou shalt feel playi
ng upon thy skin.  It will disturb thy meditation twice or thrice, after which
thou shouldst have conquered this distraction.  But unless thou first feel it,
that Breath hath not arisen.
   3. Next, the night is riven by the lightning flash.  This also {362} shalt t
hou feel in thy body, which shall shiver and leap with the shock, and that also
 must both be suffered and overcome.
   4. After the lightning flash, resteth in the zenith a minute point of light.
  And that light shall radiate until a right cone be established upon the sea,
and it is day.
   With this thy body shall be rigid, automatically; and this shalt thou let en
dure, withdrawing thyself into thine heart in the form of an upright Egg of bla
ckness; and therein shalt thou abide for a space.
   5. When all this is perfectly and easily performed at will, let the aspirant
 figure to himself a struggle with the whole force of the Universe.  In this he
 is only saved by his minuteness.  But in the end he is overcome by Death, who
covers him with a black cross.
   Let his body fall supine with arms outstretched.
   6. So lying, let him aspire fervently unto the Holy Guardian Angel.
   7. Now let him resume his former posture.
   Two and twenty times shall he figure to himself that he is bitten by a serpe
nt, feeling even in his body the poison thereof.  And let each bite be healed b
y an eagle or hawk, spreading its wings above his head, and dropping thereupon
a healing dew.  But let the last bite be so terrible a pang at the nape of the
neck that he seemeth to die, and let the healing dew be of such virtue that he
leapeth to his feet.
   8. Let there be now placed within his egg a red cross, then a green cross, t
hen a golden cross, then a silver cross; or those things which these shadow for
th.  Herein is silence; for he that hath rightly performed the meditation will
understand the inner meaning hereof, and it shall serve as a test of himself an
d his fellows.
   9. Let him now remain in the Pyramid or Cone of Light, as an Egg, but no mor
e of blackness.
  10. Then let his body be in the position of the Hanged Man, and let him aspir
e with all his force unto the Holy Guardian Angel.
  11. The grace having been granted unto him, let him partake mystically of the
 Eucharist of the Five Elements and let him proclaim Light in Extension; yea, l
et him proclaim Light in Extension.  {363}

   "These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet of Osiris,
so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with his fantastic spear
." Liber Lapidis Lazuli.  VII. 3.
   0. Be seated in thine Asana, or recumbent in Shavasana, or in the position o
f the dying Buddha.
   1. Think of thy death; imagine the various diseases that may attack thee, or
 accidents overtake thee.  Picture the process of death, applying always to thy
self.
   (A useful preliminary practice is to read textbooks of Pathology, and to vis
it museums and dissecting-rooms.)
   2. Continue this practice until death is complete; follow the corpse through
 the stages of embalming, wrapping and burial.
   3. Now imagine a divine breath entering thy nostrils.
   4. Next, imagine a divine light enlightening the eyes.
   5. Next, imagine the divine voice awakening the ears.
   6. Next, imagine a divine kiss imprinted on the lips.
   7. Next, imagine the divine energy informing the nerves and muscles of the b
ody, and concentrate on the phenomenon which will already have been observed in
 3, the restoring of the circulation.
   8. Last, imagine the return of the reproductive power, and employ this to th
e impregnation of the Egg of light in which man is bathed.
   9. Now represent to thyself that this Egg is the Disk of the Sun, setting in
 the west.
  10. Let it sink into blackness, borne in the bark of heaven, upon the back of
 the holy cow Hathor.  And it may be that thou shalt hear the moaning thereof.
  11. Let it become blacker than all blackness.  And in this meditation thou sh
alt be utterly without fear, for that the blankness that will appear unto thee
is a thing dreadful beyond all thy comprehension.
   And it shall come to pass that if thou hast well and properly {364} performe
d this meditation that on a sudden thou shalt hear the drone and booming of a B
eetle.
  12. Now then shall the Blackness pass, and with rose and gold shalt thou aris
e in the East, with the cry of an Hawk resounding in thine ear.  Shrill shall i
t be and harsh.
  13. At the end shalt thou rise and stand in the mid-heaven, a globe of glory.
  And therewith shall arise the mighty Sound that holy men have likened unto th
e roaring of a Lion.
  14. Then shalt thou withdraw thyself from the Vision, gathering thyself into
the divine form of Osiris upon his throne.
  15. Then shalt thou repeat audibly the cry of triumph of the god re-arisen, a
s it shall have been given unto thee by thy Superior.
  16. And this being accomplished, thou mayest enter again into the Vision, tha
t thereby shall be perfected in Thee.
  17. After this shalt thou return into the Body, and give thanks unto the Most
 High God IAIDA, yea unto the Most High God IAIDA.
  18. Mark well that this operation should be performed if it be possible in a
place set apart and consecrated to the Works of the Magick of Light.  Also that
 the Temple should be ceremonially open as thou hast knowledge and skill to per
form, and that at the end thereof the closing should be most carefully accompli
shed.  But in the preliminary practice it is enough to cleanse thyself by ablut
ion, by robing, and by the rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram.
   0-2 should be practised at first, until some realisation is obtained; and th
e practice should always be followed by a divine invocation of Apollo or of Isi
s or of Jupiter or of Serapis.
   Next, after a swift summary of 0-2 practice 3-7.
   This being mastered, add 8.
   Then add 9-13.
   Then being prepared and fortified, well fitted for the work, perform the who
le meditation at one time.  And let this be continued until perfect success be
attained therein.  For this is a mighty meditation and holy, having power even
upon Death, yea, having power even upon Death.
   (Note by Fra. O.M.  At any time during this meditation the {365} concentrati
on may bring about Samadhi.  This is to be feared and shunned, more than any ot
her breaking of control, for that it is the most tremendous of the forces which
 threaten to obsess.  There is also some danger of acute delirious melancholia
at point 1.)

                              III

                              SSS

   "Thou art a beautiful thing, whiter than a woman in the column of this vibra
tion.
   "I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above.
   "But it is death, and the flame of the pyre.
   "Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my Soul!
   "Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into which thou ra
diatest thy little light.
   "When Thou shalt know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in thy
great N.O.X." Liber Lapidis Lazuli. I. 36-40.
   0. Be seated in thine Asana, preferably the Thunderbolt.
   It is essential that the spine be vertical.
   1. In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal cord is
the Lingam.
   2. Concentrate thy thought of adoration in the brain.
   3. Now begin to awaken the spine in this manner.  Concentrate thy thought of
 thyself in the base of the spine, and move it gradually up a little at a time.
   By this means thou wilt become conscious of the spine, feeling each vertebra
 as a separate entity.  This must be achieved most fully and perfectly before t
he further practice is begun.
   4. Next, adore the brain as before, but figure to thyself its content as inf
inite.  Deem it to be the womb of Isis, or the body of Nuit.
   5. Next, identify thyself with the base of the spine as before, but figure t
o thyself its energy as infinite.  Deem it to be the phallus of Osiris or the b
eing of Hadit.
   6. These two concentrations 4 and 5 may be pushed to the {366} point of Sama
dhi.  Yet lose not control of the will; let not Samadhi be thy master herein.
   7. Now then, being conscious both of the brain and the spine, and unconsciou
s of all else, do thou imagine the hunger of the one for the other; the emptine
ss of the brain, the ache of the spine, even as the emptiness of space and the
aimlessness of Matter.
   And if thou hast experience of the Eucharist in both kinds, it shall aid thi
ne imagination herein.
   8. Let this agony grow until it be insupportable, resisting by will every te
mptation.  Not until thine whole body is bathed in sweat, or it may be in sweat
 of blood, and until a cry of intolerable anguish is forced from thy closed lip
s, shalt thou proceed.
   9. Now let a current of light, deep azure flecked with scarlet, pass up and
down the spine, striking as it were upon thyself that art coiled at the base as
 a serpent.
   Let this be exceedingly slow and subtle; and though it be accompanied with p
leasure, resist; and though it be accompanied with pain, resist.
  10. This shalt thou continue until thou art exhausted, never relaxing the con
trol.  Until thou canst perform this one section 9 during a whole hour, proceed
 not.  And withdraw from the meditation by an act of will, passing into a gentl
e Pranayama without Kumbhakham, and meditating on Harpocrates, the silent and v
irginal God.
   11. Then at last, being well-fitted in body and mind, fixed in peace, beneat
h a favourable heaven of stars, at night, in calm and warm weather, mayst thou
quicken the movement of the light until it be taken up by the brain and the spi
ne, independently of thy will.
   12. If in this hour thou shouldst die, is it not written, "Blessed are the d
ead that die in the Lord"?  Yea, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord!

                                vel
                           EXERCITIORUM

                           SUB FIGURA IX>

                                I.

   1. It is absolutely necessary that all experiments should be recorded in det
ail during, or immediately after, their performance.
   2. It is highly important to note the physical and mental condition of the e
xperimenter or experimenters.
   3. The time and place of all experiments must be noted; also the state of th
e weather, and generally all conditions which might conceivably have any result
 upon the experiment either as adjuvants to or causes of the result, or as inhi
biting it, or as sources of error.
   4. The A.'. A.'. will not take official notice of any experiments which are
not thus properly recorded.
   5. It is not necessary at this stage for us to declare fully the ultimate en
d of our researches; nor indeed would it be understood by those who have not be
come proficient in these elementary courses.
   6. The experimenter is encouraged to use his own intelligence, and not to re
ly upon any other person or persons, however distinguished, even among ourselve
s.
   7. The written record should be intelligently> prepared so that others may b
enefit from its study.
   8. The Book John St. John published in the first number of the "Equinox" is
an example of this kind of record by a very advanced student.  It is not as sim
ply written as we could wish, but will show the method.
   9. The more scientific the record is, the better.  Yet the emotions should b
e noted, as being some of the conditions.
   Let then the record be written with sincerity and care; thus with practice i
t will be found more and more to approximate to the ideal.  {368}


                                II

                       Physical clairvoyance.

   1. Take a pack of (78) Tarot playing cards.  Shuffle; cut.  Draw one card.
Without looking at it, try to name it.  Write down the card you name, and the a
ctual card.  Repeat, and tabulate results.
   2. This experiment is probably easier with an old genuine pack of Tarot card
s, preferably a pack used for divination by some one who really understood the
matter.
   3. Remember that one should expect to name the right card once in 78 times.
 Also be careful to exclude all possibilities of obtaining the knowledge throug
h the ordinary senses of sight and touch, or even smell.
   There was once a man whose fingertips were so sensitive that he could feel t
he shape and position of the pips and so judge the card correctly.
   4. It is better to try first the easier form of the experiment, by guessing
only the suit.
   5. Remember that in 78 experiments you should obtain 22 trumps and 14 of eac
h other suit; so that without any clairvoyance at all, you can guess right twic
e in 7 times (roughly) by calling trumps each time.
   6. Note that some cards are harmonious.
   Thus it would not be a bad error to call the five of Swords ("The Lord of De
feat") instead of the ten of Swords ("The Lord of Ruin").  But to call the Lord
 of Love (2 Cups) for the Lord of Strife (5 Wands) would show that you were get
ting nothing right.
   Similarly a card ruled by Mars would be harmonious with a 5, a card of Gemin
i with "The Lovers".
   7. These harmonies must be thoroughly learnt, according to the numerous tabl
es given in 777.
   8. As you progress you will find that you are able to distinguish the suit c
orrectly three times in four and that very few indeed inharmonious errors occur
, while in 78 experiments you are able to name the card aright as many as 15 or
 20 times.
   9. When you have reached this stage, you may be admitted for {369} examinati
on; and in the event of your passing you will be given more complex and difficu
lt exercises.


                              III

                         Asana --- Posture.

   1. You must learn to sit perfectly still with every muscle tense for long pe
riods.
   2. You must wear no garments that interfere with the posture in any of these
 experiments.
   3. The first position: (The God).  Sit in a chair; head up, back straight, k
nees together, hands on knees, eyes closed.
   4. The second position: (The Dragon).  Kneel; buttocks resting on the heels,
 toes turned back, back and head straight, hands on thighs.
   5. The third position: (The Ibis).  Stand, hold left ankle with right hand,>
 free forefinger on lips.
   6. The fourth position: (The Thunderbolt).  Sit; left heel pressing up anus,
 right foot poised on its toes, the heel covering the phallus; arms stretched o
ut over the knees; head and back straight.
   7. Various things will happen to you while you are practising these position
s; they must be carefully analysed and described.
   8. Note down the duration of practice; the severity of the pain (if any) whi
ch accompanies it, the degree of rigidity attained, and any other pertinent mat
ters.
   9. When you have progressed up to the point that a saucer filled to the brim
 with water and poised upon the head does not spill one drop during a whole hou
r, and when you can no longer perceive the slightest tremor in any muscle; when
, in short, you are perfectly steady and easy, you will be admitted for examina
tion; and, should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficul
t practices.


                              IV

           Pranayama --- Regularisation of the Breathing

   1. At rest in one of your positions, close the right nostril with the thumb
of the right hand and breathe out slowly and completely {370} through the left
nostril, while your watch marks 20 seconds.  Breathe in through the same nostri
l for 10 seconds.  Changing hands, repeat with the other nostril.  Let this be
continuous for one hour.
   2. When this is quite easy to you, increase the periods to 30 and 15 seconds
.
   3. When this is quite easy to you, but not before, breathe out for 15 second
s, in for 15 seconds, and hold the breath for 15 seconds.
   4. When you can do this with perfect ease and comfort for a whole hour, prac
tice breathing out for 40 and in for 20 seconds.
   5. This being attained, practice breathing out for 20, in for 10, holding th
e breath for 30 seconds.
   When this has become perfectly easy to you, you may be admitted for examinat
ion, and should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficult
practices.
   6. You will find that the presence of food in the stomach, even in small qua
ntities, makes the practices very difficult.
   7. Be very careful never to overstrain your powers; especially never get so
short of breath that you are compelled to breathe out jerkily or rapidly.
   8. Strive after depth, fullness, and regularity of breathing.
   9. Various remarkable phenomena will very probably occur during these practi
ces.  They must be carefully analysed and recorded.


                              V

                 Dharana --- Control of Thought.

   1. Constrain the mind to concentrate itself upon a single simple object imag
ined.
   The five tatwas are useful for this purpose; they are: a black oval; a blue
disk; a silver crescent; a yellow square; a red triangle.
   2. Proceed to combinations of simple objects; e.g. a black oval within a yel
low square, and so on.
   3. Proceed to simple moving objects, such as a pendulum swinging, a wheel re
volving, etc.  Avoid living objects.
   4. Proceed to combinations of moving objects, e.g. a piston {371} rising and
 falling while a pendulum is swinging.  The relation between the two movements
should be varied in different experiments.
   Or even a system of flywheels, eccentrics, and governor.
   5. During these practices the mind must be absolutely confined to the object
 determined upon; no other thought must be allowed to intrude upon the consciou
sness.  The moving systems must be regular and harmonious.
   6. Note carefully the duration of the experiments, the number and nature of
the intruding thoughts, the tendency of the object itself to depart from the co
urse laid out for it, and any other phenomena which may present themselves.  Av
oid overstrain; this is very important.
   7. Proceed to imagine living objects; as a man, preferably some man known to
, and respected by, yourself.
   8. In the intervals of these experiments you may try to imagine the objects
of the other senses, and to concentrate upon them.
   For example, try to imagine the taste of chocolate, the smell of roses, the
feeling of velvet, the sound of a waterfall or the ticking of a watch.
   9. Endeavour finally to shut out all objects of any of the senses, and preve
nt all thoughts arising in your mind.  When you feel you have attained some suc
cess in these practices, apply for examination, and should you pass, more compl
ex and difficult practices will be prescribed for you.


                              VI

                      Physical limitations.

   1. It is desirable that you should discover for yourself your physical limit
ations.
   2. To this end ascertain for how many hours you can subsist without food or
drink before your working capacity is seriously interfered with.
   3. Ascertain how much alcohol you can take, and what forms of drunkenness as
sail you.  {372}
   4. Ascertain how far you can walk without once stopping; likewise with danci
ng, swimming, running, etc.
   5. Ascertain for how many hours you can do without sleep.
   6. Test your endurance with various gymnastic exercises, club swinging, and
so on.
   7. Ascertain for how long you can keep silence.
   8. Investigate any other capacities and aptitudes which may occur to you.
   9. Let all these things be carefully and conscientiously recorded; for accor
ding to your powers will it be demanded of you.


                              VII

                       A Course of Reading

   1. The object of most of the foregoing practices will not at first be clear
to you; but at least (who will deny it?) they have trained you in determination
, accuracy, introspection, and many other qualities which are valuable to all m
en in their ordinary avocations, so that in no case will your time have been wa
sted.
   2. That you may gain some insight into the nature of the Great Work which li
es beyond these elementary trifles, however, we should mention that an intellig
ent person may gather more than a hint of its nature from the following books,
which are to be taken as serious and learned contributions to the study of Natu
re, though not necessarily to be implicitly relied upon.
   "The Yi King" (S.B.E. Series, Oxford University Press.)
   "The Tao Teh King" (S.B.E. Series.)
   "Tannhauser", by A. Crowley.
   "The Upanishads".
   "The Bhagavad-Gita".
   "The Voice of the Silence."
   "Raja Yoga", by Swami Vivekananda.
   "The Shiva Sanhita".
   "The Aphorisms of Patanjali".
   "The Sword of Song".
   "The Book of the Dead".
   "Rituel et Dogme de la Haute Magie".  {373}
   "The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage".
   "The Goetia".
   "The Hathayoga Pradipika".
   "The Spiritual Guide of Molinos".
   Erdmann's "History of Philosophy".
   "The Star in the West" (Captain Fuller).
   "The Dhammapada" (S.B.E. Series, Oxford University Press).
   "The Questions of King Milinda" (S.B.E. Series).
   "777 vel Prolegomena, etc.".
   "Varieties of Religious Experience" (James).
   "Kabbala Denudata".
   "Knox Om Pax".
   3. Careful study of these books will enable the pupil to speak in the langua
ge of his master, and facilitate communications with him.
   4. The pupil should endeavour to discover the fundamental harmony of these v
ery varied works; for this purpose he will find it best to study the most extre
me divergencies side by side.
   5. He may at any time that he wishes apply for examination in this course of
 reading.
   6. During the whole of this elementary study and practice he will do wisely
to seek out and attach himself to, a master, one competent to correct him and a
dvise him.  Nor should he be discouraged by the difficulty of finding such a pe
rson.
   7. Let him further remember that he must in no wise rely upon, or believe in
, that master.  He must rely entirely upon himself, and credit nothing whatever
 but that which lies within his own knowledge and experience.
   8. As in the beginning, so at the end, we here insist upon the vital importa
nce of the written record as the only possible check upon error derived from th
e various qualities of the experimenter.
   9. Thus let the work be accomplished duly; yea, let it be accomplished duly.
   (If any really important or remarkable results should occur, or if any great
 difficulty presents itself, the A.'. A.'. should be at once informed of the ci
rcumstances.)  {374}

                         SUB FIGURA VI.>

                                I.

   1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the mos
t minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in the preparat
ion.
   2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits and
 Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may
 not exist.
   It is immaterial whether they exist or not.  By doing certain things certain
 results follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objecti
ve reality or philosophic validity to any of them.
   3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:
     (a) A widening of the horizon of the mind.
     (b) An improvement of the control of the mind.
   4. The student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will f
ind himself confronted by things (ideas or beings) too glorious or too dreadful
 to be described.  It is essential that he remain the master of all that he beh
olds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion and the pr
ey of madness.
   Before entering upon any of these practices the student must be in good heal
th, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and Dharana.
   5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fai
l to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, eve
n though it be by those which it is necessary that he should attain.  Too often
, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the goal, and taketh off h
is armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun.  {375}
   It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the impor
tance which it at first seems to possess.
   6. First, then, let us consider the Book "777" and its use; the preparation
of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which fo
llow in Chapter V.  "Viator in Regnis Arboris" and in Chapter VI "Sagitta trans
 Lunam."
   (In another book will be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of Conscio
usness; progress by slaying the Chakkrams; progress by slaying the Pairs of Opp
osites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, etc., etc.)


                               II.

   1. The student must first obtain a thorough knowledge of "Book 777", especia
lly of the columns printed elsewhere in this Book.>
   When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature o
f these correspondences.  (See Illustrations in "The Temple of Solomon the King
" in Equinox No. 2.  Cross references are given.)
   2. If we take an example, the use of the tables will become clear.
   Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science.
   In column xlv to the > power , line 12, you will find "Knowledge of Sciences
."
   By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the Plane
t corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal figures the octagon an
d octagram.  The God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetrag
rammaton Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its choir of Angels
 Beni Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Or
ange (for Mercury is the Sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8) Yellow, Purple, Grey and
 Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfume
s Mastic and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal o
r Agate; its sacred animal the Snake, etc., etc. {376}
   3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accordingly.  In an orange c
ircle you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you would
 place eight lamps.  The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius
 Agrippa and other books) you would draw in the four colours with such other de
vices as your experience may suggest.
   4. And so on.  We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary prepara
tions; and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books, of w
hich the "Goetia" is perhaps the best example.
   These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary, the student s
hould do nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he have a
ny capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective than th
e highly polished ones of other people.
   The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows:
   5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his w
ish to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him
 directly suggest that idea.  Thus, in the ritual quoted, if his glance fall up
on the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again
 Mercury is brought to his mind.  In other words the whole magical apparatus an
d ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.
   (The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets o
f images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to particular l
ineal figures, divine names, etc. and are controlled by them.  As to the possib
ility of producing results external to the mind of the seer (objective in the o
rdinary common sense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.)
   6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of ceremonia
l (and the two Methods which later we shall describe). These are:
   (1) Assumption of God-forms.
   (2) Vibration of Divine Names.
   (3) Rituals of "Banishing" and "Invoking".
   These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous Methods
of Chapter V and VI are attempted>.  {377}


                              III

   1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly familia
r.  This can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in such books as
 may be accessible to the student.  They should then be carefully painted by hi
m, both from the model and from memory.
   2. The student, seated in the "God" position, or in the characteristic attit
ude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with his ow
n body, or as enveloping it.  This must be practised until mastery of the image
 is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced.
   It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain tests of suc
cess in this practice exist.
   3. The Vibration of God-names.  As a further means of identifying the human
consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name of some
God, let him act thus:
   4. (a) Stand with arms outstretched>.  (See illustration, in Equinox No. 2,
p. 13>).
   (b) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of the God de
sired entering with the breath.
   (c) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar plex
us, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet.
   (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance the left f
oot about 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn back to t
he side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical positio
n of the God Horus>, and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up and th
rough the body, while you breathe it out through the nostrils with the air whic
h has been till then retained in the lungs.  All this must be done with all the
 force of which you are capable.
   (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger> {378} upon
the lips, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God Harpocrates
.
   5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single
"Vibration" entirely exhausts his physical strength.  It should cause him to gr
ow hot all over or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken him that he w
ill find it difficult to remain standing.
   6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceiv
ed, when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the con
course of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great V
oice proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself.
   In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form a
nd name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer it takes for normal pe
rception to return, the better.


                               IV.


   I. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram must be committed to memory; th
ey are as follows ---

             "The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram"

    i. Touching the forehead say Ateh (Unto Thee),
   ii. Touching the breast say Malkuth (The Kingdom),
  iii. Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power)>,
   iv. Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory),
    v. Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm, Amen (To
          the Ages, Amen).
   vi. Turning to the East make a pentagram (that of Earth) with
        the proper weapon (usually the Wand).  Say (i.e. vibrate)
        IHVH.
  vii. Turning to the South, the same, but say ADNI.
 viii. Turning to the West, the same, but say AHIH.
   ix. Turning to the North, the same, but say AGLA (Pronounce:
          Ye-ho-wau, Adonai, Eheieh, Agla).
    x. Extending the arms in the form of a cross say,
   xi. Before me Raphael;
  xii. Behind me Gabriel; {379}
 xiii. On my right hand, Michael.
  xiv. On my left hand, Auriel;
   xv. For about me flames the Pentagram,
  xvi. And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.
  xvii-xxi. Repeat (i) to (v), the Qabalistic Cross.

                 "The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram"

   The Pentagrams are traced in the air with the sword or other weapon, the nam
e spoken aloud, and the signs used, as illustrated.

To invoke or banish planets or zodiacal signs.  The Hexagram of Earth alone is
used.  Draw the hexagram, {385} beginning from the point which is attributed to
 the planet you are dealing with. (See "777" col. lxxxiii).  Thus to invoke Jup
iter begin from the right hand point of the lower triangle, dextro-rotary and c
omplete; then trace the upper triangle from its left hand point and complete.

   For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram, with the sigil of Caput
 Draconis or Cauda Draconis.
  To banish, reverse the hexagram.
  In all cases use a conjuration first with Ararita, and next with the name of
the God corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.
   The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in plate on preceding page.
   2. These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear in flame
, in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be visible to the ey
es of a bystander, were one present.  It is alleged that some persons have atta
ined the power of actually kindling fire by these means.  Whether this be so or
 not, the power is not one to be aimed at.
   3. Success in "banishing" is known by a "feeling of cleanliness" in the atmo
sphere; success in "invoking" by a "feeling of holiness".  It is unfortunate th
at these terms are so vague.
   But at least make sure of this; that any imaginary figure or being shall ins
tantly obey the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure.  In o
bstinate cases, the form of the appropriate God may be assumed.  {386}
   4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commencement of any ceremony
whatever.  Next, the student should use a general invocation, such as the "Prel
iminary Invocation" in the "Goetia" as well as a special invocation to suit the
 nature of his working.
   5. Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a matter, and its grades
 so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good sense of the student to
 decide whether or not he should be satisfied with his result.

                                V.

   1. Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions, having bat
hed and robed with the proper decorum.  Let the place of working be free from a
ll disturbance, and let the preliminary purifications, banishings and invocatio
ns be duly accomplished, and, lastly, let the incense be kindled.
   2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical ga
rments, and armed with the proper magical weapons) as enveloping his physical b
ody, or standing near to and in front of him.
   3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that imagined figu
re; so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its eyes, and hearing wit
h its ears.
   This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.
   4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great hei
ght above the earth.
   5. Let him then stop and look about him.  (It is sometimes difficult to open
 the eyes.)
   6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious of a la
ndscape.
   Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered, using the pro
per pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.
   7. Let him travel at will, either with or without guidance from such figure
or figures.
   8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will cause to appear t
he particular places he may wish to visit.
   9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and deceptions that he will
 experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks. {387}
   Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory; the appropriate pentagra
m will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay.
   10. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in such matters.
   11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body, but should any difficult
y arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile.  For example, one
may create in thought a chariot of fire with white horses, and command the char
ioteer to drive earthwards.
   It might be dangerous to go too far, or to stay too long; for fatigue must b
e avoided.
   The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or of loss of mem
ory or other mental faculty.
   12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he supposes hi
mself to have been travelling to coincide with the physical, tightening his mus
cles, drawing in his breath, and putting his forefinger to his lips.  Then let
him "awake" by a well-defined act of will, and soberly and accurately record hi
s experiences.
   It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly eas
y to perform.  It is best to learn by "travelling" with a person already experi
enced in the matter.  Two or three experiments should suffice to render the stu
dent confident and even expert.  See also "The Seer", pp. 295-333, Equinox I, 2
.


                               VI.

   1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of imp
ortance.  But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form of Dh
arana --- concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest ends.  The
 principal use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the studen
t with every kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be per
fect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transm
ute it, to cause it instantly to obey his will.
   2. Let him then begin exactly as before, but with the most intense solemnity
 and determination.
   3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise {388} in a li
ne exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical
 body is situated (or to put it more simply, straight upwards).
   4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost overco
mes him.  If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and t
hat figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.
   Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way upward
and onward!
   5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.  Whatev
er threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his hosts loosed
from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very Throne of Go
d Himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let him struggle
 on, ever on.
   6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed up in
fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.>  Let him sink (when no longer can he
strive, though his tongue by bitten through with the effort and the blood gush
from his nostrils) into the blackness of unconsciousness, and then, on coming t
o himself, let him write down soberly and accurately a record of all that hath
occurred, yea a record of all that hath occurred.

                         SUB FIGURA CLXXV.>

   0. This is the Book of Uniting Himself to a particular Deity by devotion.
   1. "Considerations before the Threshold:" --- First concerning the choice of
 a particular Deity.  This matter is of no import, sobeit that thou choose one
suited to thine own highest nature.  Howsoever, this method is not so suitable
for gods austere as Saturn, or intellectual as Thoth.  But for such deities as
in themselves partake in anywise of love it is a perfect mode.
   2. "Concerning the prime method of this Magick Art:" --- Let the devotee con
sider well that although Christ and Osiris be one, yet the former is to be wors
hipped with Christian, and the latter with Egyptian, rites.  And this, although
 the rites themselves are ceremonially equivalent.  There should, however, be "
one" symbol declaring the transcending of such limitations; and with regard to
the Deity also, there should be some "one" affirmation of his identity both wit
h all other similar gods of other nations, and with the Supreme of whom all are
 but partial reflections.
   3. "Concerning the chief place of devotion:" --- This is the Heart of the De
votee, and should be symbolically represented by that room or spot which he lov
es best.  And the dearest spot therein shall be the shrine of his temple.  It i
s most convenient if this shrine and altar should be sequestered in woods, or i
n a private grove, or garden.  But let it be protected from the profane.
   4. "Concerning the Image of the Deity:" --- Let there be an image of the Dei
ty; first because in meditation there is mindfulness induced thereby; and secon
d because a certain power enters and inhabits it by virtue of the ceremonies; o
r so it is said, and We deny it not.  Let this image be the most beautiful and
perfect which the devotee is able to procure; or if he be able to paint or to c
arve the same, it is all the better.  As for Deities with whose nature no Image
 is compatible, let them be worshipped in an {390} empty shrine.  Such are Brah
ma, and Allah.  Also some postcaptivity conceptions of Jehovah.
   5. "Further concerning the shrine." --- Let this shrine be furnished appropr
iately as to its ornaments, according to the book 777.  With ivy and pine-cones
, that is to say, for Bacchus, and let lay before him both grapes and wine.  So
 also for Ceres let there be corn, and cakes; or for Diana moon-wort and pale h
erbs, and pure water.  Further it is well to support the shrine with talismans
of the planets, signs and elements appropriate.  But these should be made accor
ding to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus by the light of the book 777 duri
ng the course of his Devotion.  It is also well, nevertheless, if a magick circ
le with the right signs and names be made beforehand.
   6. "Concerning the Ceremonies:" --- Let the Philosophus prepare a powerful I
nvocation of the particular Deity according to his Ingenium.  But let it consis
t of these several parts: ---
   First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord.
   Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.
   Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.
   Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.
   Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.
   Sixth, a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend.
   Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.
   And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty, the thi
rd of dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of confidence, the sixth o
f comradeship, the seventh of passion.
   7. "Further concerning the ceremonies." --- Let then this Invocation be the
principal part of an ordered ceremony.  And in this ceremony let the Philosophu
s in no wise neglect the service of a menial.  Let him sweep and garnish the pl
ace, sprinkling it with water or with wine as is appropriate to the particular
Deity, and consecrating it with oil, and with such ritual as may seem him best.
  And let all be done with intensity and minuteness.
   8.  "Concerning the period of devotion, and the hours thereof:" --- Let a fi
xed period be set for the worship; and it is said that the least time is nine d
ays by seven, and the greatest seven years by nine.  And concerning the hours,
let the Ceremony be performed {391} every day thrice, or at least once, and let
 the sleep of the Philosophus be broken for some purpose of devotion at least o
nce in every night.
   Now to some it may seem best to appoint fixed hours for the ceremony.  To ot
hers it may seem that the ceremony should be performed as the spirit moves them
 so to do; for this there is no rule.
   9.  "Concerning the Robes and Instruments:" --- The Wand and Cup are to be c
hosen for this Art; never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle, unless that
Pantacle chance to be of a nature harmonious.  But even so it is best to keep t
o the Wand and the Cup, and if one must choose, the Cup.
   For the Robes, that of a Philosophus, or that of an Adept Within is most sui
table; or the robe best fitted for the service of the particular Deity, as a ba
ssara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta.  So also for Vesta, one might use fo
r instrument the Lamp; or the sickle, for Chronos.
   10.  "Concerning the Incense and Libations." --- The incense should follow t
he nature of the particular Deity, as, mastic for Mercury, dittany for Persepho
ne.  Also the libations, as, a decoction of nightshade for Melancholia, or of I
ndian hemp for Uranus.
   11. "Concerning the harmony of the ceremonies:" --- Let all these things be
rightly considered, and at length, in language of the utmost beauty at the comm
and of the Philosophus, accompanied, if he has skill, by music, and interwoven,
 if the particular Deity be jocund, with dancing.  And all being carefully prep
ared and rehearsed let it be practised daily until it be wholly rhythmical with
 his aspirations, and as it were, a part of his being.
   12. "Concerning the variety of the ceremonies." --- Now, seeing that every m
an differeth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence he is identica
l, let also these ceremonies assert their identity by their diversity.  For thi
s reason do we leave much herein to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus.
   13. "Concerning the life of the devotee." --- First let his way of life be s
uch as is pleasing to the particular Deity.  Thus to invoke Neptune, let him go
 a-fishing; but if Hades, let him not approach the water that is hateful to Him
.  {392}
   14. "Further, concerning the life of the devotee:" --- Let him cut away from
 his life any act, word or thought, that is hateful to the particular Deity; as
, unchastity in the case of Artemis, evasions in the case of Ares.  Besides thi
s, he should avoid all harshness or unkindness of any kind in thought, word, or
 deed, seeing that above the particular Deity is One in whom all is One.  Yet a
lso he may deliberately practise cruelties, where the particular Deity manifest
s His Love in that manner, as in the case of Kali, and of Pan.  And therefore,
before the beginning of his periods of devotion, let him practise according to
the rules of Liber Jugorum.
   15. "Further concerning the life of the devotee:" --- Now, as many are fully
 occupied with their affairs, let it be known that this method is adaptable to
the necessities of all.
   And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux and Quintessence o
f the whole Method.
   First, if he have no Image, let him take anything soever, and consecrate it
as an Image of his God.  Likewise with his robes and instruments, his suffumiga
tions and libations; for his Robe hath he not a nightdress; for his instrument
a walking stick; for his suffumigation a burning match; for his libation a glas
s of water?
   But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of that parti
cular Deity, and not profane the same to any other use.
   16. "Continuation." --- Next, concerning his time if it be short.  Let him l
abour mentally with his Invocation, concentrating it, and let him perform this
Invocation in his heart whenever he hath the leisure.  And let him seize eagerl
y upon every opportunity for this.
   17. "Continuation." --- Third, even if he have leisure and preparation, let
him seek ever to bring inward the symbols, so that even in his well ordered shr
ine the whole ceremony revolve inwardly in his heart, that is to say in the tem
ple of his body, of which the outer temple is but an image.
   For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no Image therein; and the breat
h of man is the incense and the libation.
   18. "Continuation." --- Further concerning occupation.  Let the devotee tran
smute within the alembic of his heart every thought, or word, or act into the s
piritual gold of his devotion.  {393}
   As thus: eating.  Let him say, "I eat this food in gratitude to my Deity tha
t hath sent it to me, in order to gain strength for my devotion to Him."
   Or: sleeping.  Let him say, "I lie down to sleep, giving thanks for this ble
ssing from my Deity, in order that I may be refreshed for new devotion to Him."
   Or: reading.  Let him say: "I read this book that I may study the nature of
my Deity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me with deeper devotion to
Him."
   Or: working.  Let him say: "I drive my spade into the earth that fresh flowe
rs (fruit, or what not) may spring up to His glory, and that I, purified by toi
l, may give better devotion to Him."
   Or: whatever it may be that he is doing, let him reason it out in his mind>,
 drawing it through circumstance and circumstance to that one end and conclusio
n of the matter.  And let him not perform the act until he hath done this.
   As it is written: Liber VII, Cap. 5. ---
22.  "Every breath, every word, every thought is an act of love
         with thee.
23.  "The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love.
24.  "The songs of me are the soft sighs.
25.  "The thoughts of me are very rapture.
26.  "And my deeds are the myriads of Thy Children, the stars
         and the atoms."
   And Remember Well, that if thou wert in truth a lover, all this wouldst thou
 do of thine own nature without the slightest flaw or failure in the minutest p
art thereof.
   19. "Concerning the Lections." --- Let the Philosophus read solely in his co
pies of the holy books of Thelema, during the whole period of his devotion.  Bu
t if he weary, then let him read books which have no part whatever in love, as
for recreation.
   But let him copy out each verse of Thelema which bears upon this matter, and
 ponder them, and comment thereupon.  For therein is a wisdom and a magick too
deep to utter in any other wise.
   20. "Concerning the Meditations." --- Herein is the most potent method of at
taining unto the End, for him who is thoroughly prepared, being purified by the
 practice of the Transmutation of {394} deed into devotion, and consecrated by
the right performance of the holy ceremonies.  Yet herein is danger, for that t
he Mind is fluid as quicksilver, and bordereth upon the Abyss, and is beset by
many sirens and devils that seduce and attack it to destroy it.  Therefore let
the devotee beware, and precise accurately his meditations, even as a man shoul
d build a canal from sea to sea.
   21. "Continuation." --- Let then the Philosophus meditate upon all love that
 hath ever stirred him.  There is the love of David and of Jonathan, and the lo
ve of Abraham and Isaac, and the love of Lear and Cordelia, and the love of Dam
on and Pythias, and the love of Sappho and Atthis, and the love of Romeo and Ju
liet, and the love of Dante and Beatrice, and the love of Paolo and Francesca,
and the love of Caesar and Lucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and Nicole
tte, and the love of Daphnis and Chloe, and the love of Cornelia and Caius Grac
chus, and the love of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of Cupid and Psyche, an
d the love of Endymion and Artemis, and the love of Demeter and Persephone, and
 the love of Venus and Adonis, and the love of Lakshmi and Vishnu, and the love
 of Siva and Bhavani and the love of Buddha and Ananda, and the love of Jesus a
nd John, and many more.
   Also there is the love of many saints for their particular deity, as of St.
 Francis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for Maheswara, of Abdulla
h Haji Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatius Loyola for Mary, and many more.
   Now do thou take one such story every night, and enact it in thy mind, grasp
ing each identity with infinite care and zest, and do thou figure thyself as on
e of the lovers and thy Deity as the other.  Thus do thou pass through all adve
ntures of love, not omitting one; and to each do thou conclude: How pale a refl
ection is this of my love for this Deity!
   Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love, some intimacy with lov
e, that shall aid thee to perfect thy love.  Thus learn the humility of love fr
om one, its obedience from another, its intensity from a third, its purity from
 a fourth, its peace from yet a fifth.
   So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that perfect love
 of His.  {395}
   22. "Further concerning meditation." --- Moreover let the Philosophus imagin
e to himself that he hath indeed succeeded in his devotion, and that his Lord h
ath appeared to him, and that they converse as may be fitting.
   23. "Concerning the Mysterious Triangle." --- Now as >three cords separately
 may be broken by a child, while those same cords duly twisted may bind a giant
, let the Philosophus learn to entwine these three methods of Magick into a Spe
ll.
   To this end let him understand that as they are One, because the end is One,
 so are they One because the method is One, even the method of turning the mind
 toward the particular Deity by love in every act.
   And lest thy twine slip, here is a little cord that wrappeth tightly round a
nd round all, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.
   24. "Concerning the Mantram or Continuous Prayer." --- Let the Philosophus w
eave the Name of the particular Deity into a sentence short and rhythmical, as,
 for Artemis:  GR:epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu,  GR:epsilon-pi-ep
silon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu,  GR:Alpha-rho-tau-epsilon-mu-iota-sigma; or, for
 Shiva: Namo Shivaya namaha Aum; or, for Mary; Ave Maria; or for Pan,
 GR:Chi-alpha-iota-rho-epsilon  GR:Sigma-omega-tau-eta-rho  GR:Kappa-omicron-si
gma-mu-omicron-upsilon,  GR:Iota-omega  GR:Pi-alpha-nu,  GR:Iota-omega  GR:Pi-a
lpha-nu; or, for Allah, Hua Allahu alazi lailaha illa Hua.
   Let him repeat this day and night without cessation mechanically in his brai
n, which is thus made ready for the advent of that Lord, and armed against all
other.
   25. "Concerning the Active and the Passive." --- Let the Philosophus change
from the active love of his particular deity to a state of passive waiting, eve
n almost a repulsion, the repulsion not of distaste, but of sublime modesty.
   As it is written, Liber LXV. ii. 59, "I have called unto thee, and I have jo
urneyed with thee>, and it availed me not." 60. "I waited patiently, and Thou w
ast with me from the beginning."
   Then let him change back to the Active, until a veritable rhythm is establis
hed between the states, as it were the swinging of a pendulum.  But let him ref
lect that a vast intelligence is required for this; for he must stand as it wer
e almost without himself to watch those phases of himself, And to do this is an
 high Art, and pertaineth not altogether to the grade of Philosophus.  Neither
is it of itself helpful, but rather the reverse in this especial practice.  {39
6}
   26. "Concerning silence." --- Now there may come a time in the course of thi
s practice when the outward symbols of devotion cease, when the soul is as it w
ere dumb in the presence of its God.  Mark that this is not a cessation but a t
ransmutation of the barren seed of prayer into the green shoot of yearning.  Th
is yearning is spontaneous, and it shall be left to grow, whether it be sweet o
r bitter.  For often times it is as the torment of hell in which the soul burns
 and writhes unceasingly.  Yet it ends, and at its end continue openly thy Meth
od.
   27. "Concerning Dryness." --- Another state wherein at times the soul may fa
ll is this dark night.  And this is indeed purifying, in such depths that the s
oul cannot fathom it.  It is less like pain than like death.  But it is the nec
essary death that comes before the rising of a body glorified.
   This state must be endured with fortitude; and no means of alleviating it ma
y be employed.  It may be broken up by the breaking up of the whole Method, and
 a return to the world without.  This cowardice not only destroys the value of
all that has gone before, but destroys the value of the Oath of Fealty that tho
u hast sworn, and makes thy Will a mockery to men and gods.
   28. "Concerning the Deceptions of the Devil." --- Note well that in this sta
te of dryness a thousand seductions will lure thee away; also a thousand means
of breaking thine oath in spirit without breaking it in letter.  Against this t
hou mayst repeat the words of thine oath aloud again and again until the tempta
tion be overcome.
   Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much better for this oper
ation that thou do thus and thus, and seek to affright thee by fears for thy he
alth or thy reason.
   Or he may send against thee visions worse than madness.
   Against all this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine Oath.  So
then thou shalt go through ceremonies meaningless and hideous to thee, and blas
pheme shalt thou against thy Deity and curse Him.  And this mattereth little, f
or it is not thou, so be that thou adhere to the Letter of thine Obligation.  F
or thy Spiritual Sight is closed, and to trust it is to be led into> the precip
ice, and hurled therefrom.
   29. "Further of this matter." --- Now also subtler than all these {397} terr
ors are the Illusions of Success.  But one instant's> self-satisfaction or Expa
nsion of thy Spirit, especially in this state of dryness, and thou art lost.  F
or thou  mayst attain the False Union with the Demon himself.  Beware also of e
ven the pride which rises from having resisted the temptations.
   But so many and so subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole world co
uld not contain their enumeration.
   The answer to one and all is the persistence in the literal fulfilment of th
e routine.  Beware, then, last, of that devil who shall whisper in thine ear th
at the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life, and answer: Except a corn of
 wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bring
eth forth much fruit.
   Yet shalt thou also beware of disputation with the devil and pride in the cl
everness of thine answers to him.  Therefore, if thou hast not lost the power o
f silence, let it be first and last employed against him.
   30. "Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart." --- Now learn that thy methods
are dry, one and all.  Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they are not Lo
ve.  Yet as a man, rubbing two dry sticks together for long, suddenly found a s
park, so also from time to time will true Love leap unasked into thy mediation.
  Yet this shall die and be reborn again and again.  It may be that thou hast n
o tinder near.
   In the end shall come suddenly a great flame and devouring, and burn thee ut
terly.
   Now of these sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of these beginn
ings of the Infinite Fire, thou shalt thus be aware.  For the sparks thy heart
shall leap up, and thy ceremony or meditation or toil shall seem of a sudden to
 go of its own will; and for the little flames this shall be increased in volum
e and intensity; and for the beginnings of the Infinite Fire thy ceremony shall
 be caught up unto ravishing song, and thy meditation shall be ecstasy, and thy
 toil shall be a delight exceeding all pleasure thou hast ever known.
   And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoken; for therein
 is the End of this Magick Art of Devotion.
   31. "Considerations with regard to the use of symbols."  It is to {398} be n
oted that persons of powerful imagination, will, and intelligence have no need
of these material symbols.  There have been certain saints who are capable of l
ove for an idea as such without it being otherwise than degraded by "idolising"
 it, to use this word in its true sense.  Thus one may be impassioned of beauty
, without even the need of so small a concretion of it as "The beauty of Apollo
", the "beauty of roses", the "beauty of Attis". Such persons are rare; it may
be doubted whether Plato himself attained to any vision of absolute beauty with
out attaching to it material objects in the first place.  A second class is abl
e to contemplate ideals through this veil; a third class need a double veil, an
d cannot think of the beauty of a rose without a rose before them.  For such, i
s this Method of most use; yet let them know that there is this danger therein,
 that they may mistake the gross body of the symbol for the idea made concrete
thereby.
   32. "Considerations of further danger to those not purged of material though
t." --- Let it be remembered that in the nature of the love itself is danger.
The lust of the satyr for the nymph is indeed of the same nature as the affinit
y of quicklime for water on the one hand, and of love of Ab for Ama on the othe
r; so also is the triad Osiris, Isis, Horus like that of a horse, mare, foal, a
nd of red, blue, purple.  And this is the foundation of Correspondences.
   But it were false to say "Horus is a foal" or "Horus is purple".  One may sa
y: "Horus resembles a foal in this respect that he is the offspring of two comp
lementary beings".
   33. "Further of this matter." --- So also many have said truly that since ea
rth is that One,> and ocean is that One, therefore earth is ocean.  Unto Him go
od is illusion, and evil is illusion; therefore good is evil.  By this fallacy
of logic are many men destroyed.
   Moreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who should say,
 my heart is in Tiphereth, an Adeptus is in Tiphereth; I am therefore an adept.
   And in this practice the worst danger is this, that the love which is its we
apon should fail in one of two ways.
   First, if the love lack any quality of love, so long is it not ideal love.
For it is written of the Perfected One: "There is no member of my body which is
 not the member of some god."  Therefore {399} let not the Philosophus despise
any form of love, but harmonise all.  As it is written: Liber LXV, 32.  "So the
refore Perfection abideth not in the Pinnacles or in the Foundation, but in the
 harmony of One with all."
   Second, if any part of this love exceed, there is disease therein.  As, in t
he love of Othello for Desdemona, love's jealousy overcame love's tenderness, s
o may it be in this love of a particular Deity.  And this is more likely, since
 in this divine love no element may be omitted.
   It is by virtue of this completeness that no human love may in any way attai
n to more than to foreshadow a little part thereof.
   34. "Concerning Mortifications." --- These are not necessary to this method.
  On the contrary, they may destroy the concentration, as counter-irritants to,
 and so alleviations of, the supreme mortification which is the Absence of the
Deity invoked.
   Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in things na
turally painful, this perversion should be endured and allowed to take its cour
se.  Yet not to the interference with natural bodily health, whereby the instru
ment of the soul might be impaired.
   And concerning sacrifices for love's sake, they are natural to this Method,
and right.
    But concerning voluntary privations and tortures, without use save as again
st the devotee, they are generally not natural to healthy natures, and wrong.
For they are selfish.  To scourge one's self serves not one's master; yet to de
ny one's self bread that one's child may have cake is the act of a true mother.
   35. "Further concerning Mortifications." --- If thy body, on which thou ride
st, be so disobedient a beast that by no means will he travel in the desired di
rection, or if thy mind be baulkish and eloquent as Balaam's fabled Ass, then l
et the practice be abandoned.  Let the shrine be covered in sackcloth, and do t
hou put on habits of lamentation, and abide alone.  And do thou return most aus
terely to the practice of Liber Jugorum, testing thyself by a standard higher t
han that hitherto accomplished, and punishing effractions with a heavier goad.
 Nor do thou return to thy devotion until {400} that body and mind are tamed an
d trained to all manner of peaceable going.
   36. "Concerning minor adjuvant in the ceremonies." --- I. "Rising on the pla
nes." --- By this method mayst thou assist the imagination at the time of concl
uding thine Invocation.  Act as taught in Liber O, by the light of Liber 777.
   37. "Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies." --- II. "Talisman
ic Magic." --- Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to represen
t the particular Deity, and consecrated it with infinite love and care, do thou
 burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby giving up the shadow for
 the substance.  But it is useless to do this unless thou do really in thine he
art value the talisman beyond all else that thou hast.
   38. "Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies." --- III. "Rehears
al." --- It may assist if the traditional history of the particular Deity be re
hearsed before him; perhaps this is best done in dramatic form.  This method is
 the main one recommended in the "Exercitios Espirituales" of St. Ignatius, who
se work may be taken as a model.  Let the Philosophus work out the legend of hi
s own particular Deity, and apportioning days to events, live that life in imag
ination, exercising the five senses in turn, as occasion arises.
   39. "Concerning minor matters adjuvant in the ceremonies." --- IV. "Duresse.
" --- This method consists in cursing a deity recalcitrant; as, threatening cer
emonially "to burn the blood of Osiris, and to grind down his bones to power."
 This method is altogether contrary to the spirit of love unless the particular
 Deity be himself savage and relentless; as Jehovah or Kali.  In such a case th
e desire to perform constraint and cursing may be the sign of the assimilation
of the spirit of the devotee with that of his God, and so an advance to the Uni
on with HIm.
   40. "Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi:" ---
All Samadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of a subject and object in conscio
usness, with the result that a third thing arises which partakes in no way of t
he nature of the two.
   It would seem at first sight that it is of no importance whatever to choose
an object of meditation.  For example, the Samadhi {401} called Atmadarshana mi
ght arise from simple concentration of the thought on an imagined triangle or o
n the heart.
   But as the union of two bodies in chemistry may be endothermic or exothermic
, the combination of Oxygen with Nitrogen is gentle, while that of Oxygen with
Hydrogen is explosive; and as it is found that the most heat is disengaged as a
 rule by the union of bodies most opposite in character, and that the compound
resulting from such is most stable, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the
most important and enduring Samadhi results from the contemplation of the Objec
t most opposite to the devotee.
   >On other planes, it has been suggested that the most opposed types make the
 best marriages and produce the healthiest children.  The greatest pictures and
 operas are those in which violent extremes are blended, and so generally in ev
ery field of activity.  Even in mathematics, the greatest parallelogram is form
ed if the lines composing it are set at right angles.
   41. "Conclusions from the foregoing." --- It may then be suggested to the Ph
ilosophus, that although his work will be harder his reward will be greater if
he choose a Deity most remote from his own nature.  This method is harder and h
igher than that of Liber E.  For a simple object as there suggested is of the s
ame nature as the commonest things of life, while even the meanest Deity is bey
ond uninitiated human understanding.  On the same plane, too, Venus is nearer t
o man than Aphrodite, Aphrodite than Isis, Isis than Babalon, Babalon than Nuit
.
   Let him decide therefore according to his discretion on the one hand and his
 aspiration on the other; and let not one overrun> his fellow.
   42. "Further concerning the value of this Method." --- Certain objections ar
ise.  Firstly, in the nature of all human love is illusion, and a certain blind
ness.  Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the Abyss.  For this reason
 we give this method to the Philosophus, as the reflection of the Exempt Adept,
 who reflects the Magister Templi and the Magus.  Let then the Philosophus atta
in this Method as a foundation of the higher Methods to be given to him when he
 attains those higher grades.  {402}
   Another objection lies in the partiality of this Method.  This is equally a
defect characteristic of the Grade.
   43. "Concerning a notable danger of Success." --- It may occur that owing to
 the tremendous power of the Samadhi, overcoming all other memories as it shoul
d and does do, that the mind of the devotee may be obsessed, so that he declare
 his particular Deity to be sole God and Lord.  This error has been the foundat
ion of all dogmatic religions, and so the cause of more misery than all other e
rrors combined.
   The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature of the
Method he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time believe in his particul
ar Deity.  But let him (1) consider that this belief is only a weapon in his ha
nds, and (2) affirm sufficiently that his Deity is but an emanation or reflecti
on or eidolon of a Being beyond him, as was said in Paragraph 2.  For if he fai
l herein, since man cannot remain permanently in Samadhi, the memorised Image i
n his mind will be degraded, and replaced by the corresponding Demon, to his ut
ter ruin.
   Therefore, after Success, let him not delight overmuch in his Deity, but rat
her busy himself with his other work, not permitting that which is but a step t
o become a goal.  As it is written, Liber CLXXXV: "remembering that Philosophy
is the Equilibrium of him that is in the House of Love."
   44. "Concerning the secrecy and the rites of Blood." --- During this practic
e it is most wise that the Philosophus utter no word concerning his working, as
 if it were a Forbidden Love that consumeth him.  But let him answer fools acco
rding to their folly; for since he cannot conceal his love from his fellows, he
 must speak to them as they may understand.
   And as many Deities demand sacrifice, one of men, another of cattle, a third
 of doves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true sacrifices in thine own
 heart.  Yet if thou must symbolise them outwardly for the hardness of thine he
art, let thine own blood and no other's be spilt before that altar.> {403}
   Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and may cause the
manifestation of evil things, hostile and malicious, to thy great hurt.
   45. "Concerning a further sacrifice." --- Of this it shall be understood tha
t nothing is to be spoken; nor need anything be spoken to him that hath wisdom
to comprehend the number of the paragraph.  And this sacrifice is fatal beyond
all, unless it be a "sacrificium" indeed.>  Yet there are those who have dared
and achieved thereby.
   46. "Concerning yet a further sacrifice." --- Here it is spoken of actual mu
tilation.  Such acts are abominable; and while they may bring success in this M
ethod, form an absolute bar to all further progress.
   And they are in any case more likely to lead to madness than to Samadhi.  He
 indeed who purposeth them is already mad.
   47. "Concerning human affection." --- During this practice thou shalt in no
wise withdraw thyself from human relations, only figuring to thyself that thy f
ather or thy brother or thy wife is as it were an image of thy particular Deity
.  Thus shall they gain, and not lose, by thy working.  Only in the case of thy
 wife this is difficult, since she is more to thee than all others, and in this
 case thou mayst act with temperance, lest her personality overcome and destroy
 that of thy Deity.
   48. "Concerning the Holy Guardian Angel." --- Do thou in no wise confuse thi
s invocation with that.
   49. "The Benediction." --- And so may the love that passeth all Understandin
g keep your hearts and minds through  GR:Iota-Alpha-Omega  GR:Alpha-Delta-Omicr
on-Nu-Alpha-Iota  GR:Sigma-Alpha-Beta-Alpha-Omega and through BABALON of the Ci
ty of the Pyramids, and through Astarte, the Starry One green-girdled, in the n
ame ARARITA.  Amen.  {404}




                             LIBER RV
                               vel
                             SPIRITUS

                          SUB FIGURA CCVI.>

   2. Let the Zelator observe the current of his breath.
   3. Let him investigate the following statements, and prepare a careful recor
d of research.
   (a) Certain actions induce the flow of the breath through the right nostril
(Pingala); and, conversely, the flow of the breath through Pingala induces cert
ain actions.
   (b) Certain other actions induce the flow of the breath through the left nos
tril (Ida), and conversely.
   (c) Yet a third class of actions induce the flow of the breath through both
nostrils at once (Sushumna), and conversely.
   (d) The degree of mental and physical activity is interdependent with the di
stance from the nostrils at which the breath can be felt by the back of the han
d.
   4. "First practice." --- Let him concentrate his mind upon the act of breath
ing, saying mentally, "The breath flows in", "the breath flows out", and record
 the results.  [This practice may resolve itself into Mahasatipatthana (vide Li
ber XXV) or induce Samadhi.  Whichever occurs should be followed up as the righ
t Ingenium of the Zelator, or the advice of his Practicus, may determine.]
   5. "Second practice." Pranayama. --- This is outlined in Liber E. Further, l
et the Zelator accomplished in those practices endeavour to master a cycle of 1
0, 20, 40 or even 16, 32, 64.  But let this be done gradually and with due caut
ion.  And when he is steady and easy both in Asana and Pranayama, let him still
 further increase the period.
   Thus let him investigate these statements which follow: ---
   (a) If Pranayama be properly performed, the body will first of all become co
vered with sweat.  This sweat is different in character from that customarily i
nduced by exertion.  If the Practitioner rub this sweat thoroughly into his bod
y, he will greatly strengthen it.  {405}
   (b) The tendency to perspiration will stop as the practice is continued, and
 the body become automatically rigid.
   Describe this rigidity with minute accuracy.
   (c) The state of automatic rigidity will develop into a state characterised
by violent spasmodic movements of which the Practitioner is unconscious, but of
 whose result he is aware.  This result is that the body hops gently from place
 to place.  After the first two or three occurrences of this experience, Asana
is not lost.  The body appears (on another theory) to have lost its weight almo
st completely and to be moved by an unknown force.
   (d) As a development of this stage, the body rises into the air, and remains
 there for an appreciably long period, from a second to an hour or more.
   Let him further investigate any mental results which may occur.
   6. "Third Practice." --- In order both to economise his time and to develop
his powers, let the Zelator practise the deep full breathing which his prelimin
ary exercises will have taught him during his walks.  Let him repeat a sacred s
entence (mantra) or let him count, in such a way that his footfall beats accura
tely with the rhythm thereof, as is done in dancing.  Then let him practise Pra
nayama, at first without the Kumbhakam>, and paying no attention to the nostril
s otherwise than to keep them clear.  Let him begin by an indrawing of the brea
th for 4 paces, and a breathing out for 4 paces.  Let him increase this gradual
ly to 6.6, 8.8, 12.12, 16.16 and 24.24, or more if he be able.  Next let him pr
actise in the proper proportion 4.8, 6.12, 8.16, 12.24 and so on.  Then if he c
hoose, let him recommence the series, adding a gradually increasing period of K
umbhakam>.
   7. "Fourth practice." --- Following on this third practice, let him quicken
his mantra and his pace until the walk develops into a dance.  This may also be
 practised with the ordinary waltz step, using a mantra in three-time, such as
 GR:epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu,  GR:epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-t
heta-omicron-nu,  GR:Alpha-rho-tau-epsilon-mu-iota-sigma; or Iao, Iao Sabao; in
 such cases the practice may be combined with devotion to a particular deity: s
ee Liber CLXXV.  For the dance as such it is better to use a mantra of a non-co
mmittal character, such as  GR:Tau-omicron  GR:epsilon-iota-nu-alpha-iota,  GR:
Tau-omicron  GR:Kappa-alpha-lambda-omicron-nu,  GR:Tau-omicron 'GR:Alpha-gamma-
alpha-delta-omicron-nu,> or the like.  {406}
   8. "Fifth practice." --- Let him practice mental concentration during the da
nce, and investigate the following experiments:
   (a) The dance becomes independent of the will.
   (b) Similar phenomena to those described in 5 (a), (b), (c), (d), occur.
   9. A note concerning the depth and fullness of the breathing.  In all proper
 expiration the last possible portion of air should be expelled.  In this the m
uscles of the throat, chest, ribs, and abdomen must be fully employed, and aide
d by the pressing of the upper arms into the flanks, and of the head into the t
horax.
   In all proper inspiration the last possible portion of air must be drawn int
o the lungs.
   In all proper holding of the breath, the body must remain absolutely still.
   Ten minutes of such practice is ample to induce profuse sweating in any plac
e of a temperature of 17 Degree C or over.
   The progress of the Zelator in acquiring a depth and fullness of breath shou
ld be tested by the respirometer.
   The exercises should be carefully graduated to avoid overstrain and possible
 damage to the lungs.
   This depth and fullness of breath should be kept as much as possible, even i
n the rapid exercises, with the exception of the sixth practice following.
   10. "Sixth Practice." --- Let the Zelator breathe as shallowly and rapidly a
s possible.  He should assume the attitude of his moment of greatest expiration
, and breathe only with the muscles of his throat.  He may also practice length
ening the period between each shallow breathing.
   (This may be combined, when acquired, with concentration on the Visuddhi cak
kra, i.e. let him fix his mind unwaveringly upon a point in the spine opposite
the larynx.)>
   >
   11. "Seventh practice." --- Let the Zelator practise restraint of breathing
in the following manner.  At any stage of breathing let him suddenly hold the b
reath, enduring the need to breathe until it passes, returns, and passes again,
 and so on until consciousness is lost, either rising to Samadhi or similar sup
ernormal condition, or falling into oblivion.  {407}
   13. "Ninth practice." -- Let him practice the usual forms of Pranayama, but
let Kumbhakam be used after instead of before expiration.  Let him gradually in
crease the period of this Kumbhakam as in the case of the other.
   14. A note concerning the conditions of these experiments.
   The conditions favourable are dry, bracing air, a warm climate, absence of w
ind, absence of noise, insects and all other disturbing influences,> a retired
situation, simple food eaten in great moderation at the conclusion of the pract
ices of morning and afternoon, and on no account before practising.  Bodily hea
lth is almost essential, and should be most carefully guarded (See Liber CLXXXV
, "Task of a Neophyte").  A diligent and tractable disciple, or the Practicus o
f the Zelator, should aid him in his work.  Such a disciple should be noiseless
, patient, vigilant, prompt, cheerful, of gentle manner and reverent to his mas
ter, intelligent to anticipate his wants, cleanly and gracious, not given to sp
eech, devoted and unselfish.  With all this he should be fierce and terrible to
 strangers and all hostile influences, determined and vigorous, increasingly vi
gilant, the guardian of the threshold.
   It is not desirable that the Zelator should employ any other creature than a
 man, save in cases of necessity.  Yet for some of these purposes a dog will se
rve, for others a woman.  There are also others appointed to serve, but these a
re not for the Zelator.
   15. "Tenth Practice." --- Let the Zelator experiment if he will with inhalat
ions of oxygen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and other gases mixed in small p
roportion with his air during his practices.  These experiments are to be condu
cted with caution in the presence of a medical man of experience, and they are
only useful as facilitating a simulacrum of the results of the proper practices
 and thereby enheartening the Zelator.
   16. "Eleventh practice." --- Let the Zelator at an time during the practices
, especially during the periods of Kumbhakam, throw his will utterly towards hi
s Holy Guardian Angel, directing his eyes inward and upward, and turning back h
is tongue as if to swallow it.  {408}
   (This latter operation is facilitated by severing the fraenum linguae, which
, if done, should be done by a competent surgeon.  We do not advise this or any
 similar method of cheating difficulties.  This is, however, harmless.)>
   In this manner the practice is to be raised from the physical to the spiritu
al-plane, even as the words Ruh, Ruach, Pneuma, Spiritus, Geist, Ghost, and ind
eed words of almost all languages, have been raised from their physical meaning
s of wind, >breath, or movement, to the spiritual plane.  (RV is the old root m
eaning Yoni and hence Wheel (Fr. roue, Lat. rota, wheel) and the corresponding
Semitic root means "to go".  Similarly spirit is connected with "spiral". -- Ed
.)
   17. Let the Zelator attach no credit to any statements that may have been ma
de throughout the course of this instruction, and reflect that even the counsel
 which we have given as suitable to the average case may be entirely unsuitable
 to his own.  {409}



                            LIBER YOD
                        SUB FIGURA DCCCXXI

   (This book was formerly called Vesta.  It is referred to the path of Virgo a
nd the letter Yod.)

                               I.

   1. This is the book of drawing all to a point.
   2. Herein are described three methods whereby the consciousness of the Many
may be melted to that of the One.

                              II.

                           FIRST METHOD

   0. Let a magical circle be constructed, and within it an upright Tau drawn u
pon the ground.  Let this Tau be devised into 10 squares (See Liber CMLXIII., I
llustration 1.)
   1. Let the magician be armed with the Sword of Art.>
   2. Let him wear the black robe of a Neophyte.
   3. Let a single flame of camphor burn at the top of the Tau, and let there b
e no other light or ornament.>
   4. Let him "open" the Temple as in DCLXXI or in any other convenient manner.
   5. Standing at the appropriate quarters, at the edge of the circle, let him
banish the 5 elements by the appropriate rituals.
   6. Standing at the edge of the circle, let him banish the 7 planets by the a
ppropriate rituals.  Let him face the actual position of each planet in the hea
vens at the time of his working.
   7. Let him further banish the twelve signs of the Zodiac by the appropriate
rituals, facing each sign in turn.
   8. Let him at each of these 24 banishings make three circumambulations widde
rshins, with the signs of Horus and Harpocrates in the East as he passes it.  {
410}
   9. Let him advance to the square of Malkuth in the Tau, and perform a ritual
 of banishing Malkuth.  But here let him not leave the square to circumambulate
 the circle, but use the formula and God-form of Harpocrates.
   10. Let him advance in turn to the squares Jesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiphereth, G
eburah, Chesed and banish each by appropriate rituals.
   11. And let him know that such rituals include the pronunciation of the appr
opriate names of God backwards, and also a curse against the Sephira in respect
 of all that which it is, for that which distinguishes and separates it from Ke
ther.
   12. Advancing to the squares of Binah and Chokmah in turn, let him banish th
ese also.  And for that by now an awe and trembling shall have taken hold upon
him, let him banish these by a supreme ritual of inestimable puissance; and let
 him beware exceedingly lest his will falter or his courage fail.
   13. Finally, let him, advancing to the square of Kether, banish that also by
 what means he may.  At the end whereof let him set his foot upon the light, ex
tinguishing it>; and, as he falleth, let him fall within the circle.

                          SECOND METHOD

   1. Let the Hermit be seated in his Asana, robed, and let him meditate in tur
n upon every several part of his body until that part is so unreal to him that
he no longer includes it in his comprehension of himself.  For example if it be
 his right foot, let him touch that foot, and be alarmed, thinking, "A foot! ..
. foot!  What is this foot?  Surely I am not alone in the Hermitage!"
   And this practice should be carried out not only at the time of meditation,
but during the day's work.
   2. This meditation is to be assisted by reasoning; as "This foot is not I.
If I should lose my foot, I should still be I.  This foot is a mass of changing
 and decaying flesh, bone, skin, blood, {411} lymph, etc. while I am the Unchan
ging and Immortal Spirit, uniform, not made, unbegotten, formless, self-luminou
s," etc.
   3. This practice being perfect for each part of the body, let him combine hi
s workings until the whole body is thus understood as the non-Ego and as illusi
on.
   4. Let then the Hermit, seated in his Asana, meditate upon the Muladhara Cak
kra and its correspondence as a power of the mind, and destroy it in the same m
anner as aforesaid.  Also by reasoning: "This emotion (memory, imagination, int
ellect, will, as it may be) is not I.  This emotion is transient: I am immovabl
e.  This emotion is passion.  I am peace", and so on.
   Let the other Cakkras in their turn be thus destroyed, each one with its men
tal or moral attribute.
   5. In this let him be aided by his own psychological analysis, so that no pa
rt of his conscious being be thus left undestroyed.  And on his thoroughness in
 this matter may turn his success.
   6. Lastly, having drawn all his being into the highest Sahasrara Cakkra, let
 him remain eternally fixed in meditation thereupon.
   7. AUM.

                           THIRD METHOD.

   1. Let the Hermit stimulate each of the senses in turn, concentrating upon e
ach until it ceases to stimulate.
   (The senses of sight and touch are extremely difficult to conquer.  In the e
nd the Hermit must be utterly unable by any effort to see or feel the object of
 those senses, O.M.)
   2. This being perfected, let him combine them two at a time.
   For example, let him chew ginger (taste and touch), and watch a waterfall (s
ight and hearing) and watch incense (sight and smell) and crush sugar in his te
eth (taste and hearing) and so on.
   3. These twenty-five practices being accomplished, let him combine them thre
e at a time, then four at a time.
   4. Lastly, let him combine all the senses in a single object.
   And herein may a sixth sense be included.  He is then to withdraw himself en
tirely from all the stimulations, "perinde ac cadaver," in spite of his own eff
orts to attach himself to them.  {412}
   5. By this method it is said that the demons of the Ruach, that is, thoughts
 and memories, are inhibited, and We deny it not.  But if so be that they arise
, let him build a wall between himself and them according to the method.
   6. Thus having stilled the voices of the Six, may he obtain in sense the sub
tlety of the Seventh.
   7.  GR:Alpha-Upsilon-Mu-Gamma-Nu.
   (We add the following, contributed by a friend at that time without the A.'.
 A.'. and its dependent orders.  He worked out the method himself, and we think
 it may prove useful to many.  O.M.)
   (1) The beginner must first practise breathing regularly through the nose, a
t the same time trying hard to believe that the breath goes to the Ajna and not
 to the lungs.
   The Pranayama exercises described in the Equinox Vol. I, No. 4, p. 101 must
next be practised, always with the idea that Ajna is breathing.
   Try to realise that "power," not air, is being drawn into the Ajna, is being
 concentrated there during Kumbhakam, and is vivifying the Ajna during expirati
on.  Try rather to increase the force of concentration in Ajna than to increase
 so excessively the length of Kumbhakam as this is dangerous if rashly undertak
en.
   (2) Walk slowly in a quiet place; realise that the legs are moving, and stud
y their movements.  Understand thoroughly that these movements are due to nerve
 messages sent down from the brain, and that the controlling power lies in the
Ajna.  The legs are automatic, like those of a wooden monkey: the power in Ajna
 is that which does the work, is that which walks.  This is not hard to realise
, and should be grasped firmly, ignoring all other walking sensations.
   Apply this method to every other muscular movement.
   (3) Lie flat on the back with the feet under a heavy piece of furniture.  Ke
eping the spine straight and the arms in a line with the body, rise slowly to a
 sitting posture, by means of the force residing in the Ajna (i.e. try to preve
nt the mind dwelling one any other exertion or sensation.)
   Then let the body slowly down to its original position.  Repeat {413} this t
wo or three times, every night and morning, and slowly increase the number of r
epetitions.
   (4) Try to transfer all bodily sensations to the Ajna, e.g., "I am cold" sho
uld mean "I feel cold", or better still, "I am aware of a sensation of cold" --
- transfer this to the Ajna, "the Ajna is aware", etc.
   (5) Pain if very slight may easily be transferred to the Ajna after a little
 practice.  The best method for beginner is to imagine he has a pain in the bod
y and then imagine that it passes directly into the Ajna.  It does not pass thr
ough the intervening structures, but goes direct.  After continual practice eve
n severe pain may be transferred to the Ajna.
   (6) Fix the mind on the base of the spine and then gradually move the though
ts upwards to the Ajna.
   (In this meditation Ajna is the Holy of Holies, but it is dark and empty.)
   Finally, strive hard to drive anger and other obsessing thoughts into the Aj
na.  Try to develop a tendency to think hard of Ajna when these thoughts attack
 the mind, and let Ajna conquer them.
   Beware of thinking of My" Ajna".  In these meditations and practices, Ajna d
oes not belong to you; Ajna is the master and worker, you are the wooden monkey
.  {414}

   000. May be.
   (00. It has not been possible to construct this book on a basis of pure Scep
ticism.  This matters less, as the practice leads to scepticism, and it may be
through it.)
   0. This book is not intended to lead to the supreme attainment.  On the cont
rary, its results define the separate being of the Exempt Adept from the rest o
f the Universe, and discover his relation to the Universe.>
   1. It is of such importance to the Exempt Adept that We cannot overrate it.
 Let him in no wise adventure the plunge into the Abyss until he has accomplish
ed this to his most perfect satisfaction.>
   2. For in the Abyss no effort is anywise possible.  The Abyss is passed by v
irtue of the mass of the Adept and his Karma.  Two forces impel him: (1) the at
traction of Binah, (2) the impulse of his Karma; and the ease and even the safe
ty of his passage depend on the strength and direction of the latter.>
   3. Should one rashly dare the passage, and take the irrevocable Oath of the
Abyss, he might be lost therein through Aeons of incalculable agony; he might e
ven be thrown back upon Chesed, with the terrible Karma of failure added to his
 original imperfection.
   4. It is even said that in certain circumstances it is possible to {415} fal
l altogether from the Tree of Life and to attain the Towers of the Black Brothe
rs.  But We hold that this is not possible for any adept who has truly attained
 his grade, or even for any man who has really sought to help humanity even for
 a single second>, and that although his aspiration have been impure through va
nity or any similar imperfections.
   5. Let then the Adept who finds the result of these meditations unsatisfacto
ry refuse the Oath of the Abyss, and live so that his Karma gains strength and
direction suitable to the task at some future period.>
   6. Memory is essential to the individual consciousness; otherwise the mind w
ere but a blank sheet on which shadows are cast.  But we see that not only does
 the mind retain impressions, but that it is so constituted that its tendency i
s to retain some more excellently than others.  Thus the great classical schola
r, Sir Richard Jebb, was unable to learn even the schoolboy mathematics require
d for the preliminary examination at Cambridge University, and a special Grace>
 of the authorities was required in order to admit him.
   7. The first method to be described has been detailed in Bhikkhu Ananda Mett
eya's "Training of the Mind" (Equinox I, 5, pp. 28-59, and especially pp. 48-57
).  We have little to alter or to add.  Its most important result as regards th
e Oath of the Abyss, is the freedom from all desire or clinging to anything whi
ch it gives.  Its second result is to aid the adept in the second method, by su
pplying him with further data for his investigation.>
   8. The stimulation of memory useful in both practices is also achieved by si
mple meditation (Liber E), in a certain stage of which old memories arise unbid
den.  The adept may then practise this, stopping at this stage, and encouraging
 instead of suppressing the flashes of memory.
   9. Zoroaster has said, "Explore the River of the Soul, whence {416} or in wh
at order you have come; so that although you have become a servant to the body,
 you may again rise to that Order (the A.'. A.'.) from which you descended, joi
ning Works (Kamma) to the Sacred Reason (the Tao)".
   10. The Result of the Second Method is to show the Adept to what end his pow
ers are destined.  When he has passed the Abyss and becomes Nemo, the return of
 the current causes him "to appear in the Heaven of Jupiter as a morning star o
r as an evening star".>  In other words he should discover what may be the natu
re of his work.  Thus Mohammed was a Brother reflected into Netzach, Buddha a B
rother reflected into Hod, or, as some say, Daath.  The present manifestation o
f Frater P. to the outer is in Tiphereth, to the inner in the path of Leo.
   II. "First Method."  Let the Exempt Adept first train himself to think backw
ards by external means, as set forth here following. ---
      (a) Let him learn to write backwards, with either hand.
      (b) Let him learn to walk backwards.
      (c) Let him constantly watch, if convenient, cinematograph
             films, and listen to phonograph records, reversed,
             and let him so accustom himself to these that they
             appear natural and appreciable as a whole.
      (d) Let him practise speaking backwards: thus for "I am
             He" let him say, "Eh ma I".
      (e) Let him learn to read backwards.  In this it is difficult to
             avoid cheating one's self, as an expert reader sees a
             a sentence at a glance.  Let his disciple read aloud to
             him backwards, slowly at first, then more quickly.
      (f) Of his own ingenium, let him devise other methods.
   12. In this his brain will at first be overwhelmed by a sense of utter confu
sion; secondly, it will endeavour to evade the difficulty by a trick.  The brai
n will pretend to be working backwards when {417} it is merely normal.  It is d
ifficult to describe the nature of the trick, but it will be quite obvious to a
nyone who has done practices (a) and (b) for a day or two.  They become quite e
asy, and he will think that he is making progress, an illusion which close anal
ysis will dispel.
   13. Having begun to train his brain in this manner and obtained some little
success, let the Exempt Adept, seated in his Asana, think first of his present
attitude, next of the act of being seated, next of his entering the room, next
of his robing, etc. exactly as it happened.  And let him most strenuously endea
vour to think each act as happening backwards.  It is not enough to think, "I a
m seated here, and before that I was standing, and before that I entered the ro
om", etc.  That series is the trick detected in the preliminary practices.  The
 series must not run "ghi-def-abc" but "ihgfedcba": not "horse a is this" but "
esroh a si siht".  To obtain this thoroughly well, practice (c) is very useful.
  The brain will be found to struggle constantly to right itself, soon accustom
ing itself to accept "esroh" as merely another glyph for "horse".  This tendenc
y must be constantly combated.
   14. In the early stages of this practice, the endeavour should be to meticul
ous minuteness of detail in remembering actions; for the brain's habit of think
ing forward will at first be insuperable.  Thinking of large and complex action
s, then, will give a series which we may symbolically write "opqrstu-hijklmn-ab
cdefg".  If these be split into detail, we shall have "stu-pqr-o-mn-kl-hij-fg-c
de-ab" which is much nearer to the ideal "utsrqponmlkjihgfedcba".
   15. Capacities differ widely, but the Exempt Adept need have no reason to be
 discouraged if after a month's continuous labour he find that now and again fo
r a few seconds his brain really works backwards.
   16. The Exempt Adept should concentrate his efforts upon obtaining a perfect
 picture of five minutes backwards rather than upon extending the time covered
by his meditation.  For this preliminary training of the brain is the Pons Asin
orum of the whole process.
   17. This five minutes' exercise being satisfactory, the Exempt Adept may ext
end the same at his discretion to cover an hour, a {418} day, a week, and so on
.  Difficulties vanish before him as he advances; the extension from a day to t
he course of his whole life will not prove so difficult as the perfecting of th
e five minutes.
   18. This practice should be repeated at least four times daily, and progress
 is shown firstly by the ever easier running of the brain, secondly by the adde
d memories which arise.
   19. It is useful to reflect during this practice, which in time becomes almo
st mechanical, upon the way in which effects spring from causes.  This aids the
 mind to link its memories, and prepares the adept for the preliminary practice
 of the second method.
   20. Having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the hour of
birth, it should be encouraged to endeavour to penetrate beyond that period.>
If it be properly trained to run backwards, there will be little difficulty in
doing this, although it is one of the distinct steps in the practice.
   21. It may be then that the memory will persuade the adept of some previous
existence.  Where this is possible, let it be checked by an appeal to facts, as
 follows: ---
   22. It often occurs to men that on visiting a place to which they have never
 been, it appears familiar.  This may arise from a confusion of thought or a sl
ipping of the memory, but it is conceivably a fact.
   If, then, the adept "remember" that he was in a previous life in some city,
say Cracow, which he has in this life never visited, let him describe from memo
ry the appearance of Cracow, and of its inhabitants, setting down their names.
 Let him further enter into details of the city and its customs.  And having do
ne this with great minuteness, let him confirm the same by consultation with hi
storians and geographers, or by a personal visit, remembering (both to the cred
it of his memory and its discredit) that historians, geographers, and himself a
re alike fallible.  But let him not trust his memory, to assert its conclusions
 as fact, and act thereupon, without most adequate confirmation.
   23. This process of checking his memory should be practised {419} with the e
arlier memories of childhood and youth by reference to the memories and records
 of others, always reflecting upon the fallibility even of such safeguards.
   24. All this being perfected, so that the memory reaches back into aeons inc
alculably distant, let the Exempt Adept meditate upon the fruitlessness of all
those years, and upon the fruit thereof, severing that which is transitory and
worthless from that which is eternal.  And it may be that he being but an Exemp
t Adept may hold all to be savourless and full of sorrow.
   25. This being so, without reluctance will he swear the Oath of the Abyss.
   26. "Second Method." --- Let the Exempt Adept, fortified by the practice of
the first method, enter the preliminary practice of the second method.
   27. "Second Method." --- Preliminary Practices.  Let him, seated in his Asan
a, consider any event, and trace it to its immediate causes.  And let this be d
one very fully and minutely.  Here, for example, is a body erect and motionless
.  Let the adept consider the many forces which maintain it; firstly, the attra
ction of the earth, of the sun, of the planets, of the farthest stars, nay of e
very mote of dust in the room, one of which (could it be annihilated) would cau
se that body to move, although so imperceptibly.  Also the resistance of the fl
oor, the pressure of the air, and all other external conditions.  Secondly, the
 internal forces which sustain it, the vast and complex machinery of the skelet
on, the muscles, the blood, the lymph, the marrow, all that makes up a man.  Th
irdly the moral and intellectual forces involved, the mind, the will, the consc
iousness.  Let him continue this with unremitting ardour, searching Nature, lea
ving nothing out.
   28. Next, let him take one of the immediate causes of his position, and trac
e out its equilibrium.  For example, the will.  What determines the will to aid
 in holding the body erect and motionless?
   29. This being discovered, let him choose one of the forces which determined
 his will, and trace out that in similar fashion; and let this process be conti
nued for many days until the interdependence of all things is a truth assimilat
ed in his inmost being.  {420}
   30. This being accomplished, let him trace his own history with special refe
rence to the causes of each event.  And in this practice he may neglect to some
 extent the universal forces which at all times act on all, as for example, the
 attraction of masses, and let him concentrate his attention upon the principal
 and determining or effective causes.
   For instance, he is seated, perhaps, in a country place in Spain.  Why? Beca
use Spain is warm and suitable for meditation, and because cities are noisy and
 crowded.  Why is Spain warm? and why does he wish to meditate? Why choose warm
 Spain rather than warm India?  To the last question: Because Spain is nearer t
o his home.  Then why is his home near Spain? Because his parents were Germans.
  And why did they go to Germany?  And so during the whole meditation.
   31. On another day, let him begin with a question of another kind, and every
 day devise new questions, not concerning his present situation, but also abstr
act questions.  Thus let him connect the prevalence of water upon the surface o
f the globe with its necessity to such life as we know, with the specific gravi
ty and other physical properties of water, and let him perceive ultimately thro
ugh all this the necessity and concord of things, not concord as the schoolmen
of old believed, making all things for man's benefit or convenience, but the es
sential mechanical concord whose final law is "inertia."  And in these meditati
ons let him avoid as if it were the plague any speculations sentimental or fant
astic.
   32. "Second Method."  The Practice Proper.  --- Having then perfected in his
 mind these conceptions, let him apply them to his own career, forging the link
s of memory into the chain of necessity.
   And let this be his final question: To what purpose am I fitted?  Of what se
rvice can my being prove to the Brothers of the A.'. A.'. if I cross the Abyss,
 and am admitted to the City of the Pyramids?
   33. Now that he may clearly understand the nature of this question, and the
method of solution, let him study the reasoning of the anatomist who reconstruc
ts an animal from a single bone.
   To take a simple example. ---
   34. Suppose, having lived all my life among savages, a ship is {421} cast up
on the shore and wrecked.  Undamaged among the cargo is a "Victoria".  What is
its use?  The wheels speak of roads, their slimness of smooth roads, the brake
of hilly roads.  The shafts show that it was meant to be drawn by an animal, th
eir height and length suggest an animal of the size of a horse.  That the carri
age is open suggests a climate tolerable at any time of the year.>  The height
of the box suggest crowded streets, or the spirited character of the animal emp
loyed to draw it.  The cushions indicate its use to convey men rather than merc
handise; its hood that rain sometimes falls, or that the sun is at times powerf
ul.  The springs would imply considerable skill in metals; the varnish much att
ainment in that craft.
   35. Similarly, let the adept consider of his own case.  Now that he is on th
e point of plunging into the Abyss a giant Why? confronts him with uplifted clu
b.
   36. There is no minutest atom of his composition which can be withdrawn with
out making him some other than he is; no useless moment in his past.  Then what
 is his future?  The "Victoria" is not a wagon; it is not intended for carting
hay.  It is not a sulky; it is useless in trotting races.
   37. So the adept has military genius, or much knowledge of Greek; how do
these attainments help his purpose, or the purpose of the Brothers?  He was
 ut to death by Calvin, or stoned by Hezekiah; as a snake he was killed by a vi
llager, or as an elephant slain in battle under Hamilcar.  How do such memories
 help him?  Until he have thoroughly mastered the reason for every incident in
his past, and found a purpose for every item of his present equipment,> he cann
ot truly answer even those Three Question what were first put to him, even the
Three Questions of the Ritual of the Pyramid; he is not ready to swear the Oath
 of the Abyss.
   38. But being thus enlightened, let him swear the Oath of the Abyss; yea, le
t him swear the Oath of the Abyss.  {422}

   00. One is the Magus: twain His forces; four His weapons.  These are the sev
en Spirits of Unrighteousness; seven vultures of evil.  Thus is the art and cra
ft of the Magus but glamour.  How shall He destroy Himself?
   0. Yet the Magus hath power upon the Mother both directly and through love.
 And the Magus is Love, and bindeth together That and This in His Conjuration.
   1. In the beginning doth the Magus speak Truth, and send forth Illusion and
Falsehood to enslave the soul.  Yet therein is the Mystery of Redemption.
   2. By his Wisdom made He the Worlds: the World> that is God is none other th
an He.
   3. Now then shall He end His Speech with Silence?  For He is Speech.
   4. He is the First and the Last.  How shall He cease to number Himself?
   5. By a Magus is this writing made known through the mind of a Magister.  Th
e one uttereth clearly, and the other Understandeth; yet the Word is falsehood,
 and the Understanding darkness.  And this saying is of All Truth.
   6. Nevertheless it is written; for there be times of darkness, and this as a
 lamp therein.
   7. With the Wand createth He.
   8. With the Cup preserveth He.
   9. With the Dagger destroyeth He.
  10. With the Coin redeemeth He.
  11. His weapons fulfil the wheel; and on What Axle that turneth is not known
unto Him.
  12. From all these actions must He cease before the curse of His Grade is upl
ifted from Him.  Before He attain to that which existeth without Form.
  13. And if at this time He be manifested upon earth as a Man, and therefore i
s this present writing, let this be His method, that {423} the curse of His gra
de, and the burden of His attainment, be uplifted from Him.
   14. Let Him beware of abstinence from action.  For the curse of His grade is
 that he must speak Truth, that the Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of
men.  Let Him then utter that without Fear, that the Law may be fulfilled.  And
 according to His Original Nature will that law be shapen, so that one may decl
are gentleness and quietness, being an Hindu; and another fierceness and servil
ity, being a Jew; and yet another ardour and manliness, being an Arab.  Yet thi
s matter toucheth the mystery of Incarnation, and is not here to be declared.
   15. Now the grade of a Magister teacheth the Mystery of Sorrow, and the grad
e of a Magus the Mystery of Change, and the grade of Ipsissimus the Mystery of
Selflessness, which is called also the Mystery of Pan.
   16. Let the Magus then contemplate each in turn, raising it to the ultimate
power of Infinity.  Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selfles
sness is Self.  For the interplay of the parts hath no action upon the whole.
And this contemplation shall be performed not by simple meditation --- how much
 less then by reason! --- but by the method which shall have been given unto Hi
m in His initiation to the Grade.
   17. Following which method, it shall be easy for Him to combine that trinity
 from its elements, and further to combine Sat-Chit-Ananda, and Light, Love, Li
fe, three by three into nine that are one, in which meditation success shall be
 That which was first adumbrated to Him in the grade of Practicus (which reflec
teth Mercury into the lowest world) in "Liber XXVII," "Here is Nothing under it
s three forms."
   18. And this is the Opening of the Grade of Ipsissimus, and by the Buddhists
 it is called the trance Nerodha-Samapatti.
   19. And woe, woe, woe, yea woe, and again woe, woe, woe, unto seven times be
 His that preacheth not His law to men!
   20. And woe also be unto Him that refuseth the curse of the grade of a Magus
, and the burden of the Attainment thereof.
   21. And in the word CHAOS let the book be sealed, yea, let the Book be seale

m.
   Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Evening.
   5. And after each of these invocations thou shalt give the sign of silence,
and afterward thou shalt perform the adoration that is taught thee by thy Super
ior.  And then do thou compose Thyself to holy meditation.
   6. Also it is better if in these adorations thou assume the God-form of Whom
 thou adorest, as if thou didst unite with Him in the adoration of That which i
s beyond Him.
   7. Thus shalt thou ever be mindful of the Great Work which thou hast underta
ken to perform, and thus shalt thou be strengthened to pursue it unto the attai
nment of the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happi
ness.  {426}

   0. Behold the Yoke upon the neck of the Oxen!  Is it not thereby that the Fi
eld shall be ploughed?  The Yoke is heavy, but joineth together them that are s
eparate --- Glory to Nuit and to Hadit, and to Him that hath given us the Symbo
l of the Rosy Cross!
   Glory unto the Lord of the Word Abrahadabra, and Glory unto Him that hath gi
ven us the Symbol of the Ankh, and of the Cross within the Circle!
   1. Three are the Beasts wherewith thou must plough the Field; the Unicorn, t
he Horse, and the Ox.  And these shalt thou yoke in a triple yoke that is gover
ned by One Whip.
   2. Now these Beasts run wildly upon the earths> and are not easily obedient
to the Man.
   3. Nothing shall be said here of Cerberus, the great Beast of Hell that is e
very one of these and all of these, even as Athanasius hath foreshadowed.  For
this matter> is not of Tiphereth without, but Tiphereth within.

                                I.

   0. The Unicorn is speech.  Man, rule thy Speech!  How else shalt thou master
 the Son, and answer the Magician at the right hand gateway of the Crown?
   1. Here are practices.  Each may last for a week or more.
   (a) Avoid using some common word, such as "and" or "the" or "but"; use a par
aphrase.
   (b) Avoid using some letter of the alphabet, such as "t" or "s" or "m"; use
a paraphrase.
   (c) Avoid using the pronouns and adjectives of the first person; use a parap
hrase.
   Of thine own ingenium devise others.  {427}
   2. On each occasion that thou art betrayed into saying that thou art sworn t
o avoid, cut thyself sharply upon the wrist or forearm with a razor; even as th
ou shouldst beat a disobedient dog.  Feareth not the Unicorn the claws and teet
h of the Lion?
   3. Thine arm then serveth thee both for a warning and for a record.  Thou sh

vigilant at all times over the least word that slippeth from thy tongue.
   Thus bind thyself, and thou shalt be for ever free.

   (a) Avoiding lifting the left arm above the waist.
   (b) Avoid crossing the legs.

   2. On each occasion that thou art betrayed into doing that thou art sworn to

   0. The Ox is Thought.  Man, rule thy Thought!  How else shalt thou master th
e Holy Spirit, and answer the High Priestess in the Middle Gateway of the Crown
?
   1. Here are practices.  Each may last for a week or more.
   (a) Avoid thinking of a definite subject and all things connected with it, a
nd let that subject be one which commonly occupies much of thy thought, being f
requently stimulated by sense-perceptions or the conversation of others.  {428}
   (b) By some device, such as the changing of thy ring from one finger to anot
her, create in thyself two personalities, the thoughts of one being within enti
rely different limits from that of the other, the common ground being the neces
sities of life.>

hman?

   1. This is the secret of the Holy Graal, that is the sacred vessel of our La
dy, the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, the Bride of Chaos,
that rideth upon our Lord the Beast.
   2. Thou shalt drain out thy blood that is thy life into the golden cup of he
r fornication.
   3. Thou shalt mingle thy life with the universal life.  Thou shalt keep not
back one drop.
   4. Then shall thy brain be dumb, and thy heart beat no more, and all thy lif
e shall go from thee; and thou shalt be cast out upon the midden, and the birds
 of the air shall feast upon thy flesh, and thy bones shall whiten in the sun.
   5. Then shall the winds gather themselves together and bear thee up as it we
re a little heap of dust in a sheet that hath four corners, and they shall give
 it unto the guardian> of the Abyss.
   6. And because there is no life therein, the guardian> of the Abyss shall bi
d the angels of the winds pass by.  And the angels thereof shall be no more.>
   7. Now therefore that thou mayest achieve this ritual of the Holy Graal, do
thou divest thyself of all thy goods.
   8. Thou hast wealth; give it unto them that have need thereof, yet no desire
 toward it.
   9. Thou hast health; slay thyself in the fervour of thine abandonment unto O
ur Lady.  Let thy flesh hang loose upon thy bones, and thine eyes glare with th
y quenchless lust unto the Infinite, with thy passion for the Unknown, for Her
that is beyond Knowledge the accursed one.
  10. Thou hast love; tear thy mother from thine heart and spit in the face of
thy father.  Let thy foot trample the belly of thy wife, and let the babe at he
r breast be the prey of dogs and vultures.
  11. For if thou dost not this with thy will, then shall We do {430} this desp
ite thy will.  So that thou attain to the Sacrament of the Graal in the Chapel
of Abominations.
  12. And behold! if by stealth thou keep unto thyself one thought of thine, th
en shalt thou be cast out into the abyss for ever; and thou shalt be the lonely
 one, the eater of dung, the afflicted in the Day of Be-With-Us.
  13. Yea! verily this is the Truth, this is the Truth, this is the Truth.  Unt
o thee shall be granted joy and health and wealth and wisdom when thou art no l
onger thou.
  14. Then shall every gain be a new sacrament, and it shall not defile thee; t
hou shalt revel with the wantons> in the market place, and the virgins shall fl
ing roses upon thee, and the merchants bend their knees and bring thee gold and
 spices.  Also young boys shall pour wonderful wines for thee, and the singers
and the dancers shall sing and dance for thee.
  15. Yet shalt thou not be therein, for thou shalt be forgotten, dust lost in
dust.
  16. Nor shall the aeon itself avail thee in this; for from the dust shall a w
hite ash be prepared by Hermes the Invisible.
  17. And this is the wrath of God, that these things should be thus.
  18. And this is the grace of God, that these things should be thus.
  19. Wherefore I charge you that ye come unto me in the Beginning; for if ye t
ake but one step in this Path, ye must arrive inevitably at the end thereof.
  20. This Path is beyond Life and Death; it is also beyond Love, but that ye k
now not, for ye know not Love.
  21. And the end thereof is known not even unto Our Lady, nor to the Beast whe
reon She rideth, nor unto the Virgin her daughter, nor unto Chaos her lawful Lo
rd; but unto the Crowned Child is it known?  It is not known if it be known.
  22. Therefore unto Hadit and unto Nuit be the glory in the End and the Beginn
ing; yea, in the End and the Beginning.  {431}

   0. Gnarled Oak of God!  In thy branches is the lightning nested!  Above thee
 hangs the Eyeless Hawk.
   1. Thou art blasted and black!  Supremely solitary in that heath of scrub.
   2. Up!  The Ruddy clouds hang over thee!  It is the storm.
   3. There is a flaming gash in the sky.
   4. Up.
   5. Thou art tossed about in the grip of the storm for an aeon and an aeon an
d an aeon.  But thou givest not thy sap; thou fallest not.
   6. Only in the end shalt thou give up thy sap when the great God F.I.A.T. is
 enthroned on the day of Be-With-Us.
   7. For two things are done and a third thing is begun.  Isis and Osiris are
given over to incest and adultery.  Horus leaps up thrice armed from the womb o
f his mother.  Harpocrates his twin is hidden within him.  SET is his holy cove
nant, that he shall display in the great day of M.A.A.T., that is being interpr
eted the Master of the Temple of A.'. A.'., whose name is Truth.
   8. Now in this is the magical power known.
   9. It is like the oak that hardens itself and bears up against the storm.  I
t is weather-beaten and scarred and confident like a sea-captain.
  10. Also it straineth like a hound in the leash.
  11. It hath pride and great subtlety.  Yea, and glee also!
  12. Let the Magus act thus in his conjuration.
  13. Let him sit and conjure; let him draw himself together in that forcefulne
ss; let him rise next swollen and straining; let him dash back the hood from hi
s head and fix his basilisk eye upon the sigil of the demon.  Then let him sway
 the force of him to and fro like a satyr in silence, until the Word burst from
 his throat.
  14. Then let him not fall exhausted, although he> might have been ten thousan
dfold the human; but that which floodeth him is {432} the infinite mercy of the
 Genitor-Genitrix of the Universe, whereof he is the Vessel.
   15. Nor do thou deceive thyself.  It is easy to tell the live force from the
 dead matter.  It is no easier to tell the live snake from the dead snake.
   16. Also concerning vows.  Be obstinate, and be not obstinate.  Understand t
hat the yielding of the Yoni is one with the lengthening of the Lingam.  Thou a
rt both these; and thy vow is but the rustling of the wind on Mount Meru.
   17. How> shalt thou adore me who am the Eye and the Tooth, the Goat of the S
pirit, the Lord of Creation.  I am the Eye in the Triangle, the Silver Star tha
t ye adore.
   18. I am Baphomet, that is the Eightfold Word that shall be equilibrated wit
h the Three.
   19. There is no act or passion that shall not be an hymn in mine honour.
   20. All holy things and all symbolic things shall be my sacraments.
   21. These animals are sacred unto me; the goat, and the duck, and the ass, a
nd the gazelle, the man, the woman and the child.
   22. All corpses are sacred unto me; they shall not be touched save in mine e
ucharist.  All lonely places are sacred unto me; where one man gathereth himsel
f together in my name, there will I leap forth in the midst of him.
   23. I am the hideous god, and who mastereth me is uglier than I.
   24. Yet I give more than Bacchus and Apollo; my gifts exceed the olive and t
he horse.
   25. Who worshippeth me must worship me with many rites.
   26. I am concealed with all concealments; when the Most Holy Ancient One is
stripped and driven through the market place, I am still secret and apart.
   27. Whom I love I chastise with many rods.
   28. All things are sacred to me; no thing is sacred from me.
   29. For there is no holiness where I am not.
   30. Fear not when I fall in the fury of the storm; for mine acorns are blown
 afar by the wind; and verily I shall rise again, {433} and my children about m
e, so that we shall uplift our forest in Eternity.
   31. Eternity is the storm that covereth me.
   32. I am Existence, the Existence that existeth not save through its own Exi
stence, that is beyond the Existence of Existences, and rooted deeper than the
No-Thing-Tree in the Land of No-Thing.
   33. Now therefore thou knowest when I am within Thee, when my hood is spread
 over thy skull, when my might is more than the penned Indus, and resistless as
 the Giant Glacier.
   34. For as thou art before a lewd woman in Thy nakedness in the bazaar, suck
ed up by her slyness and smiles, so art thou wholly and no more in part before
the symbol of the beloved, though it be but a Pisacha or a Yantra or a Deva.
   35. And in all shalt thou create the Infinite Bliss and the next link of the
 Infinite Chain.
   36. This chain reaches from Eternity to Eternity, ever in triangles --- is n
ot my symbol a triangle? --- ever in circles --- is not the symbol of the Belov
ed a circle?  Therein is all progress base illusion, for every circle is alike
and every triangle alike!
   37. But the progress is progress, and progress is rapture, constant, dazzlin
g, showers of light, waves of dew, flames of the hair of the Great Goddess, flo
wers of the roses that are about her neck, Amen!
   38. Therefore lift up thyself as I am lifted up.>
   Hold thyself in as I am master to accomplish.  At the end, be the end far di
stant as the stars that lie in the navel of Nuit, do thou slay thyself as I at
the end am slain, in the death that is life, in the peace that is mother of war
, in the darkness that holds light in his hand, as an harlot that plucks a jewe
l from her nostrils.
   39. So therefore the beginning is delight, and the end is delight, and delig
ht is in the midst, even as the Indus is water in the cavern of the glacier, an
d water among the greater hills and the lesser hills and through the ramparts o
f the hills and through the plains, and water at the mouth thereof when it leap
s forth into the mighty sea, yea, into the mighty sea.
