  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The intelligence office of the 509th Bombardment group 
  at Roswell Army Field announced at noon today, that the field has come into 
  possession of a flying saucer. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> According to information released by the department, 
  over authority of Maj.J. A. Marcel, intelligence officer, the disk was recovered 
  on a ranch in the Roswell vicinity, after an unidentified rancher had notified 
  Sheriff Geo. Wilcox, here, that he had found the instrument on his premises. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Major Marcel and a detail from his department went to 
  the ranch and recovered the disk, it was stated. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> After the intelligence officer here had inspected the 
  instrument it was flown to higher headquarters. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The intelligence office stated that no details of the 
  saucer's construction or its appearance had been revealed. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Mr. and Mrs. Dan Wilmot apparently were the only persons 
  in Roswell who seen what they thought was a flying disk. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> They were sitting on their porch at 105 South Penn. 
  last Wednesday night at about ten o'clock when a large glowing object zoomed 
  out of the sky from the southeast, going in a northwesterly direction at a high 
  rate of speed. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wilmot called Mrs. Wilmot's attention to it and both 
  ran down into the yard to watch. It was in sight less then a minute, perhaps 
  40 or 50 seconds, Wilmot estimated. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wilmot said that it appeared to him to be about 1,500 
  feet high and going fast. He estimated between 400 and 500 miles per hour. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In appearance it looked oval in shape like two inverted 
  saucers, faced mouth to mouth, or like two old type washbowls placed, together 
  in the same fashion. The entire body glowed as though light were showing through 
  from inside, though not like it would inside, though not like it would be if 
  a light were merely underneath. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> From where he stood Wilmot said that the object looked 
  to be about 5 feet in size, and making allowance for the distance it was from 
  town he figured that it must have been 15 to 20 feet in diameter, though this 
  was just a guess. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wilmot said that he heard no sound but that Mrs. Wilmot 
  said she heard a swishing sound for a very short time. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The object came into view from the southeast and disappeared 
  over the treetops in the general vicinity of six mile hill. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wilmot, who is one of the most respected and reliable 
  citizens in town, kept the story to himself hoping that someone else would come 
  out and tell about having seen one, but finally today decided that he would 
  go ahead and tell about it. The announcement that the RAAF was in possession 
  of one came only a few minutes after he decided to release the details of what 
  he had seen. </font>
