  <font color="#FFFFFF"><B>Abstract</B></font> 
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In this paper, I will attempt to explain a theoretical 
  basis of gravity first put forward by John Ernst Keely in the late nineteenth 
  century. He contended that matter vibrating in unison is mutually attracted 
  and that matter vibrating in dissonance or discord is pushed apart. I will also 
  explain the amazing phenomena of black hole repulsive jets, some of which spew 
  out matter from their rotational axis at speeds approaching or exceeding the 
  speed of light. I contend that these axial matter jets are a result of antigravitic 
  repulsion caused by the rotation of the hole’s core and its distorting effect. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Taking the example of black holes and their repulsive 
  jets, I contend that it is possible to create similar axial repulsion by rotating 
  atomic nuclei very rapidly. I have detailed a number of systems to accomplish 
  this. They perfectly explain many of the UFO shapes reported and explain perfectly 
  the functioning of the multi-layered purported UFO crash debris held by Art 
  Bell (Bismuth and Magnesium micro-layers) and by the Roswell Museum (Silver 
  and Copper micro-layers). </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF"><B>Introduction</B></font> 
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> String theory suggests that all matter, from the simplest 
  form to the most complex is composed of vibrating strings or surfaces. Matter 
  naturally vibrates in unison and/or harmony with other matter. This matter vibration 
  creates waves through the ether (the dynamic intersection of three dimensional 
  space and the higher dimensional surfaces if you have difficulty imagining higher 
  dimensions intersecting our own, imagine a two dimensional plane a surface, 
  not an airplane - in three dimensional space. The three dimensional space must 
  intersect the two dimensional plane. Now visualize our three dimensional universe 
  as that two dimensional plane in three dimensional space which is actually four 
  dimensional space. The four dimensional space intersects the three dimensional 
  plane the same way three dimensional space intersects two. Fifth dimensional 
  space intersects the fourth dimensional plane in the same way. The sixth does 
  the same thing, and so on up to who-knows-what-dimension. All these dimensions 
  intersect three dimensional space). When separate matter produces waves through 
  the ether, the separate wave patterns create interference patterns that are 
  the intersections of the emitted waves. (One can make two dimensional interference 
  patterns by dropping two pebbles into a body of water in different places. As 
  the waves expand and move through one another, they create a pattern of the 
  intersections of the waves. This pattern is called an interference pattern.) 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> As the three dimensional waves from separate matter 
  intersect and form an interference pattern, a higher ethereal energy state is 
  created, because when waves emitted from matter intersect they create additional 
  "scalar" waves (fourth dimensional waves - see Tom Bearden’s research). When 
  this happens, the ether naturally attempts to return to a lower energy state. 
  If separate matter is vibrating in unisons or harmonies, moving the matter closer 
  together results in a reduction of interference patterns and therefore moves 
  the system to a lower energy state. However, it is possible for matter to vibrate 
  in discord to the unisons and harmonies of other matter. In this case, the ethereal 
  interference patterns created cannot be resolved by moving the matter closer 
  together; rather, interference patterns remain and increase due to the amplitude 
  increase of the interfering waves seen as the matter comes together. Therefore, 
  to decrease the ether's energy state, the matter in discord is pushed away to 
  reduce the intensity of the interference patterns and the resultant scalar waves. 
  Therefore, we can state that matter vibrating in harmony or in unison with other 
  matter is brought together, but matter vibrating in dissonance or discord with 
  other matter is pushed away. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Examples of both unisonic and harmonic attraction and 
  also discordic repulsion may be observed spectacularly from rapidly spinning 
  black holes. In these black holes, the emitted wave pitch distortion is caused 
  by a Doppler-like effect (similar to the effect that changes the sound of a 
  racecar as it races past spectators, except it happens across the ether not 
  through air) due to the core’s rapid spin rate. As a black hole’s core rotates, 
  assuming a symmetrical core, distorted waves are emitted parallel to the axis 
  pushing vast quantities of matter away from the black hole at speeds approaching 
  or exceeding the speed of light, while perpendicular to the axis plane at the 
  equator, the distortions are cancelled out. This cancellation may occur when, 
  from the equatorial plane, the rotation effects from one side of the core are 
  cancelled by the opposite movement of the other side of the core, and the average 
  of the distortions occurring would be the unisonic and harmonic frequencies 
  necessary for gravitational attraction. While from the axis, there is no counter-movement, 
  just pure rotation both sides of the core spin in the same direction. Therefore, 
  we see massive gravitational attraction from the equatorial plane, and massive 
  repulsion from the axis. This repulsion from some of the more massive holes 
  has been repeatedly shown to produce matter jets that, according to scientists, 
  "seem" to be travelling faster than the speed of light. It is important to note 
  that no accepted explanation for these jets has yet been presented. Indeed, 
  not only have solitary black holes been seen to possess such jets; other rotating 
  systems such as neutron stars, galactic nuclei, quasars, and even normal stars 
  have been shown to produce directed and columnar repulsive jets from their axis. 
  Obviously, this Doppler-like distortion (via rotation and also linear movement) 
  is a key to antigravity and no doubt is the reason for the universe's accelerating 
  expansion. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are also other methods of ethereal matter wave 
  pitch distortion, such as the high voltage capacitive fields developed by Townsend 
  Brown (which possibly use similar techniques to those described below -- who 
  knows, though? We have no access to Brown's research data), and direct manipulation 
  of matter vibrations using high harmonics of sonic or electromagnetic waves, 
  but those will be discussed in future papers. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I believe the easiest method of distorting the waves 
  emitted from matter is to take the example provided by black holes and use rotating 
  masses. [Using linear movement for distortion would be theoretically possible 
  for transportation, but if one could reach the necessary speeds, there would 
  be little need for the repulsive effect.] To really be useful, and produce significant 
  axial distortion, a mass must be very dense and must be rotating very, very 
  quickly. The rotating mass must consist of atoms with unbalanced nuclei in order 
  to maintain, through inertial imbalances, a changing orientation throughout 
  each rotation. Otherwise, the nuclei will maintain their position and little 
  distortion will occur, much like water and ice in a glass tend to hold their 
  positions no matter how one rotates the glass. But even with unbalanced nuclei, 
  simply spinning normal samples of matter at achievable speeds has produced only 
  minimal effects. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Perhaps a feasible alternative would be to rotate many 
  atomic nuclei individually at very high speeds. Nuclei are ultra-dense, nearly 
  like little neutron stars or black holes, but with protons and a positive charge. 
  Because nuclei rotate fairly stabily and without friction, it is possible to 
  accelerate their rotation to extremely high speeds and produce very strong distortions 
  from their axis. Aligning all the axis of nucleic rotation in a sample would 
  provide directed distortion waves. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> There exists several ways to accomplish this nucleic 
  spin. Rotation may be initiated primarily by free electron inertial transference 
  n (moving electrons past or around the nucleus), variable magnetic fields, or 
  secondarily by gravitational or protonic or valence electron inertial transference 
  (one nucleus or it's electrons transfer their inertia and spin another nucleus). 
  Combinations of these methods might increase overall efficiency of a design. 
  </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF"><B>Electrically Induced Rotation</B></font> 
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Certain nucleic geometries reflect, to a significant 
  degree, the movements of nearby electrons. The elements that exhibit such geometries 
  have an odd number of protons and an even number of neutrons. In such atoms, 
  the protons are not uniformly dispersed throughout the nucleus. Instead, one 
  side of the nucleus is slightly more positive than the other. These elements 
  exhibit a slight natural distortion effect that may be deduced by observing 
  their atomic radii, which are significantly smaller than expected due to the 
  repulsive effect generated by nearby nuclei. The unbalanced element with the 
  most massive nucleus is Bismuth, element 83. It is the most diamagnetic (generates 
  an opposite magnetic field to the one that is applied) of all the elements. 
  Its nucleus has the most amount of matter available for distorted wave production 
  and also has the strongest inter-nucleic attractive forces which allow it the 
  highest maximum spin rate of all the unbalanced nuclei. These factors combine 
  to make Bismuth the obvious choice for electro-repulsive experiments. A stable 
  element 115 would be better than Bismuth, but recent research shows that that 
  the half-life is only around 30 seconds. Other diamagnetic elements could be 
  used as well (copper would be good, too) and it is possible that superconductive 
  materials (due to their complete diamagnetism at cold temperatures) might be 
  superior to Bismuth; however, they might not due to their molecular structure. 
  The question must be answered, but no one wants to have to dip their antigravity 
  craft in liquid nitrogen every 20 minutes or so, anyway. Bismuth will be used 
  as the element of choice in this paper. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> To spin nuclei with electricity, it may be preferable 
  to use thin Bismuth films and pass high-voltage DC pulses across them to speed 
  and align nucleic rotation. High-voltage current has a tendency to travel on 
  surfaces as far as possible from the interior of the conductor. Therefore, the 
  current would be most likely to pass over the tops of the surface Bismuth atoms 
  and less likely to pass through the valleys between them due to the electrical 
  pressure. The effect on the individual nuclei can be likened to water falling 
  over a waterwheel. This tendency would allow the axis of the Bismuth atoms to 
  align perpendicular to the current direction and tangential to the film plane 
  while simultaneously initiating and speeding nucleic rotation. Distorted waves 
  would be emitted from the nuclei parallel to the axis. Depending upon amperage 
  and ribbon thickness, these rotations may be initiated and maintained throughout 
  the entire thickness with a single reversal of rotational direction in the middle 
  or the ribbon, or with a very weak current, inertial transference may induce 
  counter-rotations of the Bismuth atoms that lie beneath the surface layer. It 
  is not known what effect counter-rotations would have on efficiency, but I suspect 
  they would be counter-productive. Therefore, to minimize significant counter-rotation, 
  limiting the thickness of the Bismuth film would seem to be important. Of course, 
  simultaneously sending DC pulses in one direction on one side of the film, and 
  in a counter direction on the other side of the film would solve counter-rotation 
  problems completely, but this is only possible using multi-layered materials. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> To initiate rotation it might be desirable to provide 
  a highly conductive layer adjacent to the Bismuth film (Art Bell's Roswell Debris: 
  https://www.artbell.com/rosreprt.html, and personal communication with Steve 
  Wingate). With this adaptation, charge still races across the Bismuth surface 
  speeding and aligning nucleic rotation. Use of an element with balanced nuclei 
  would be recommended to reduce the chance of rotational instability and disruptions 
  due to interactions between the different layers. Magnesium would be the obvious 
  choice due to its high conductivity and light weight. Multiple Bismuth and Magnesium 
  layers might be sandwiched on top of one another for greater effect. High-voltage 
  pulsed current passed through the Magnesium, switching back across the Bismuth 
  layers would eliminate counter-rotations and effect distorted waves from the 
  nuclei towards the directions perpendicular to the electron flow and tangential 
  to the sandwich plane. It might not be physically possible to switch back the 
  current across a single Bismuth layer in this fashion, but it should certainly 
  be tried. [The extra conductive layer may not be necessary, as research into 
  Bismuth films and micro-filaments suggests a natural superconductive tendency 
  that is not present in thicker samples. I believe that the uperconductive effect 
  results from the alignment of nucleic spins with nuclei acting as electron guides 
  to reduce eddying and resistance.] </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Possibly an experimental compact design would be similar 
  to this. Around a conductive central core, a Bismuth film ten centimeters wide, 
  half a kilometer long, and a few microns thick is wrapped. From the core and 
  between each successive Bismuth layer a similar dielectric layer is wrapped 
  in a similar fashion to prevent a charge from taking a shortcut and bypassing 
  a portion of the half-kilometer length. If the free end of the Bismuth film 
  is grounded, and a sufficient high-voltage pulsed current is passed from the 
  core to the ground, distorted waves would be emitted out the top and bottom 
  of the device. [A possibly more efficient, modified design using pulses travelling 
  in opposite directions on each side of the Bismuth film would also be possible.] 
  As stated above, possibly the single Bismuth film in this design may need to 
  be replaced by a Bismuth/Magnesium sandwich for more efficient rotation initiation. 
  However, once rotation is achieved, little energy is needed to continue rotation 
  and wave distortion - the nuclei act as little flywheels. An interesting point 
  of this design is its ability to work at a distance. Distorted waves are emitted 
  in two approximate beams if the nucleic spin is stable enough. These beams would 
  neither increase nor decrease over distance, only spread out according to the 
  stability of the nucleic rotation. The simplest stable platform based on this 
  design would be an equilateral triangle with one distortion generator of this 
  type at each corner. Varying the generators' orientations would provide maneuverability. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another design that would be useful would be to use 
  the successive Bismuth-dielectric films or Bismuth-Magnesium films to coat the 
  outer surface of various shapes to provide repulsion across larger surfaces. 
  The first shape to consider is the cigar shape. When coated with successive 
  layers and a sufficient charge is passed through the "skin" from one end of 
  the cigar to the other, or sequentially back and forth across the Bismuth layers, 
  distorted waves from each nucleus are generated towards the directions tangential 
  to the skin and perpendicular to the plane which contains the nucleus and the 
  cigar's lengthwise axis. Not only would this configuration provide a nice even 
  lift, it would naturally align the cigar parallel to the earth's surface. It 
  would also deflect, to a degree dependent on the degree of distortion, all objects 
  on an approach path towards it. This would provide protection from micrometeorites, 
  projectiles, and even particle beam weapons if the distortion was strong enough 
  - anything that is affected by gravity can be deflected. For maneuverability, 
  a compact distortion generator as described above at each end of the cigar would 
  do the job. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The next logical shape to explore is the traditional 
  "flying saucer" or disk shape. If coated similarly to the above cigar, and charged 
  from top to bottom or sequentially back and forth across the Bismuth layers, 
  distorted waves would be emitted towards the directions tangential to the skin 
  and perpendicular to the plane which contains the nucleus and the axis of the 
  disk. If sitting on the ground, it would repulse laterally - providing zero 
  lift. To move the nucleic axis from the lateral, the current pulses need to 
  be made to travel around the axis of the saucer shape instead of taking the 
  shortest, fastest route between poles. The closer the spiraling of the electron 
  flow, the closer the repulsive field aligns with the axis plane and therefore 
  repulses more up and down. This spiraling may be accomplished with a spirally 
  wound core or more efficiently with a winding just deep of exterior surface. 
  With this design, only one compact distortion generator mounted axially is needed 
  to provide maneuverability. Maneuvering might also be accomplished by varying 
  the orientation of the spirally wound core. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are limitations to these designs arising from 
  the fact that all the distorted waves are directed tangential to the surface 
  and never reach the interior of the craft. This limits the acceleration and 
  deceleration to that which a human body could withstand. Why not put the occupants 
  outside, under a dome on top of the craft? This way, the repulsion forces generated 
  would, to a large degree, counter-balance the inertial forces on occupants as 
  the craft accelerated. Another solution might be to use a distortion skin with 
  a rippled shape rather than smooth. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are many other possible shapes and configurations 
  to explore using this wave distorting skin and modifications of the more compact 
  design and combinations of them both. </font>
<P> <font color="#FFFFFF"><B>Magnetically Induced Rotation</B></font> 
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> It also possible to induce nucleic rotation magnetically, 
  but as the methods described above would seem to be more efficient, I have not 
  concentrated heavily on it. My first design idea was to use a cylinder of Bismuth 
  rotated within a collar of alternating magnetic poles. As the individual Bismuth 
  atoms pass by a north pole, they will be turned and will complete a single rotation 
  as they pass by the south pole. Thus for every two magnetic poles in the collar, 
  one nucleic spin will be initiated. I would call it a rotational amplification 
  device. Using a motor operating at 25,000 and forty permanent or electromagnets 
  in the collar, I would expect individual nucleic spins at 500,000 rpm as the 
  whole core rotates at 25,000 rpm. The whole thing will look like a sun picture 
  with the Bismuth core as the sun and forty electromagnet "rays." However, this 
  design might have a problem with heat evolution which could disrupt rotational 
  stability. This design is the logical next step for those who wish to improve 
  on Podkletnev's ideas. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> My second idea was to construct a coil around a ferrous 
  sleeve containing a Bismuth core. Using an AC frequency generator at the coils 
  resonant frequency and then moving up the coil’s harmonics would be a simpler 
  and much more efficient method of inducing extremely rapid nucleic rotations 
  in the Bismuth core. With this design, the speed of achievable rotations is 
  dependent on the harmonic used and limited only by the highest harmonic used. 
  again, this design might have problems with heat evolution. Again, a chilled 
  superconducting core might increase efficiency. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Using this concept, it is also possible to construct 
  a craft with a Bismuth shell on the outside and the coil on the inside around 
  a ferrous rod. Hitting the coil at its resonant frequency and its harmonics 
  should accomplish the same trick. Varying the position of the coil would allow 
  for maneuverability. Again, there are many variations and combinations on this 
  design which need to be explored. </font>
