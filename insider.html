  <font color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Michael Wolf has since 1979 served as consultant to 
  the President and the National Security Council on extraterrestrial matters, 
  and a member of the Majestic Twelve (MJ-12), UFO-secrecy management agency's, 
  Special Studies Group, and has been leader of its lead agency, the Alphacom 
  Team. Previously he has served as an Air Force Colonel, pilot, flight surgeon 
  and counter-intelligence officer for the CIA and NSA. He has an M.D. in Neurology, 
  a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics and a D.Sc. in Computer Science. He is not a 
  lightweight. Now dying of untreatable cancer, Dr. Wolf has decided to reveal 
  what he has learned about the visiting extraterrestrial cultures to the world, 
  "because we have a right to know." His book, "The Catchers of Heaven" (1996) 
  makes many well-informed revelations. [ISBN#: 0-8059-3907-5; available from 
  Mandala Books, (888)497-2085.] </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Dr. Wolf states that the most important mission objective 
  of his Alphacom Team is resumption of negotiations with the visiting extraterrestrials. 
  In the 1950s, the U.S. administration entered into treaty terms with the so-called 
  Grey extraterrestrials from the fourth planet of the star system Zeta Reticuli, 
  but these treaties were never ratified as Constitutionally required. The Greys 
  shared certain of their technological advances with military/intelligence scientists, 
  apparently often while prisoner "guests" within secure underground military 
  installations in Nevada (Area 51) and New Mexico (Dulce Labs). The extraterrestrials 
  have given the U.S. government some of their antigravity craft and a huge amount 
  of fuel (Element 115). On May 1, 1975 during one such technology exchange in 
  Nevada, a demonstration of a small ET antimatter reactor, the lead Grey asked 
  the Colonel in charge of the Delta Forces guarding the ETs to remove all their 
  rifles and bullets from the room, (so that they would not accidentally discharge 
  during the energy emissions.) The guards refused, and in the ensuing commotion 
  a guard opened fire on the Greys. One alien, two scientists and 41 military 
  personnel were killed. One guard was left alive to attest that the ETs apparently 
  used directed mental energy in self-defense to kill the other attacking Delta 
  Forces. Dr. Wolf states that "this incident ended certain exchanges with (the 
  Greys)." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Military/intelligence scientists learned cloning techniques 
  from the extraterrestrials. After perfecting cloning techniques on animals, 
  Dr. Wolf and his associates cloned an artificial-intelligence human being, "J-Type 
  Omega", as part of Project SENTINEL, an effort to create a superbright, superpowerful 
  soldier who would follow orders without fear or question. The J-Type clone was 
  terminated, because he would not follow an order to kill an innocent dog, because 
  Dr. Wolf had surreptitiously programmed ethics into his artificial intelligence. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wolf notes that the extraterrestrials are not comfortable 
  with the world money and power brokers' need for continuing world industrialization, 
  which they see as headed towards planet-killing. Another of the Alphacom Team's 
  missions is to determine "whether we can use the ETs' technology to restore 
  this planet to its former pristine state of natural balance." The ETs are also 
  concerned about the massive proliferation of nuclear devices into many countries. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wolf states that other missions of the MJ12SSG's Alphacom 
  Team are: to determine the number and types of ET visitors, the extent of visitation 
  and the reasons, to learn about human interactions with extraterrestrials in 
  the past and currently, the cultures of the various off world visitors, and 
  how we can negotiate with them. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> According to Dr. Wolf, several confederations of extraterrestrial 
  civilizations are visiting us in loosely-coordinated fashion. These are: the 
  Alliance (of human-looking ETs from the Altair Aquila system), the Corporate 
  (of Greys from the Zeta Reticuli system), the Federation of Worlds (of unspecified 
  races from many star systems), and the United Races of Orion (cultures from 
  those star systems). Further, the Alliance is in affiliation with the Corporate 
  and with the Federation of Worlds. The United Races of Orion are in affiliation 
  with the Corporate, and, through them, with the Alliance and the Federation 
  of Worlds. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Dr. Wolf told of learning during a high-level briefing 
  in the UK that the Vatican had been applying pressure concerning the possible 
  announcement by President Clinton of UFO visitation. Of specific Vatican concern 
  was "whether he will make reference to the extraterrestrial biological entities' 
  data revealing in detail how religion was created and why." Wolf comments, "Rich 
  organized religions feel threatened by such an announcement." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Perhaps Wolf's most startling revelation is that within 
  the UFO Cover-Up there is a dark, covert renegade organization known as the 
  "Cabal". He describes it as "well-orchestrated conspiratorial bevy of plotters... 
  top-heavy with the military, and headed by (a Navy Under-Secretary)." The paranoiac 
  Cabal works against, and deliberately undermines, the goals of peaceful negotiations 
  with the extraterrestrial visitors. The Cabal uses Star Wars weapons to shoot 
  down extraterrestrial spacecraft and overcome the ETS by military might. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Dr. Wolf concludes by stating, "In all of my preparation 
  as a scientist, nothing ever prepared me for our visitors. We must understand 
  the complexity of the various forces at work on this planet, and yes, on others. 
  Let us not forget multi-dimensionality and space-time distortions, and the spirituality 
  we must regain. I feel I must also mention that spirituality is gaining strength 
  on this planet, this Sol Three. But also is the evil. We have the power to sanction 
  whatever is... for a better good for mankind." </font>
