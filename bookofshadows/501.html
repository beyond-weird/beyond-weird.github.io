                              THE PRIESTHOOD (continued)

     And so it is that they who lose or give away their following,
       Or they who through inactivity have lost their power,
          Or they who are not in harmony and love with their Spiritual Father;
               Shall be retired from a rank to which entitled
                    Other than by leadership of men.

     But this can only be done by he who ordained them,
          For only those who give can take away,
               Yet each High Priest is responsible that this is done.

     Should any Fellow fain the Priesthood, and use it wisely and well,
          The Gods have decreed that those who serve them
               Shall prosper and grow in this life,
                    And shall gain eternal perfection
                         To be freed from the Wheel of Life,
                              And to become like unto the angels
                                   In that they should be perfect.

     For perfection is to be gained by love,
          And there is no greater love than to
               Lay down one's life for his brethren
                    In their service and for their sake,
                         And the Father will reward them for
                              Their labor of love, because
                                   He is not unjust.

     THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC:
     Getting Specific about Magical Ethics


               Sometimes a clichejust wearsout. It losesmeaning or, worse,begins
     to say things we never meant. I think it's time to retire the phrase "black
     magic."

               Saying"black" when we mean "evil" is nasty nonsense. In the first
     place, it reinforces the  racist stereotypes that corrupt our  society. And
     that's not all. Whenever we  say "black" instead of "bad," we  repeat again
     the big lie that darkness is wrong. It isn't, as people who profess to love
     Nature should know.

               Darkness canmean the inside of the womb, and the seed germinating
     within  the  Earth,  and  the  chaos  that gives  rise  to  all  truly  new
     beginnings. In our myths, the  one who goes down to the  underworld returns
     with  the treasure. Even death, to the Wiccan understanding, is well-earned
     rest and  comfort, and a preparation  for new birth. Using  "black" to mean
     "bad" is a blasphemy against the Crone.

               But even if we no longer speak of magic as "black" or "white," we
     still need to think and speak about the ethics of magic. Although black  is
     not evil,  some actions are  evil. It simply  is not  true that anything  a
     person is  strong enough or  skilled enough to  do is OK, nor  should doing
     what we  will ever  be the whole  of the law  for us.  We need a  clear and
     specific vocabulary that enables us to choose wisely what we will do.

               We need  to replace the word "black," not simply to drop it. Some
     Pagans have tried using "negative" as their substitute, but that turned out
     to be confusing. For some people, "negative" means any spell to diminish or
     banish anything. Some things  - tumors, depression, bigotry -  are harmful.
     There's nothing wrong with a working to get rid of bad stuff. "Left-handed"
     is another common term for wrongful practice, very traditional, but just as
     ignorant, superstitious and potentially harmful as the phrase "black magic"
     itself. So in Proteus  we tried using the word  "unethical."  That's a  lot
     better - free of extraneous and false implications - but still too vague.

          Gradually, I began to wonder whether using any one word, "black" or
     "unethical"  or whatever,  might just  be too  general and  too subjective.
     Perhaps all I really tell a student that way is "Judy doesn't like that."

          I won't settle for blind obedience. If ethical principles are going to
     survive the  twin tests of time  and temptation, people need  to understand
     just what  to avoid, and  why. Even more important,  they need a  basis for
     figuring out  what to do  instead. Especially when  it comes  to projective
     magic.

               Projectivemagic means active workings,the kind inwhich we project
     our will out into the world to make some kind of change.  This is what most
     people think of when they use the  word magic at all. Quite clearly,  magic
     that may affect  other people is magic that can harm.  This is the basis of
     the proverb "a  Witch who can't hex  can't heal." Either you  can raise and
     direct  power,  or you  can't.  Your strength  and  skill can  be  used for
     blessing or for bane. The choice - and the karma - are yours.


                                                                             503

          Just as some people feel that strength and skill are their own
     justification, others feel that any projective magic is always wrong - that
     it is a distraction  from our one true goal  of union with the Divine  or a
     willful avoidance  of the judgments of  Karma. I think  these attitudes are
     equally inconsistent with basic Wiccan philosophy.

               Weare taught that we will find theLady within ourselves or not at
     all, that  the Mother of All has been with  us from the beginning. We can't
     now establish a union that was always there. All  we can do, all we need to
     do, is become aware. Knowing what it feels like to heal and empower,  again
     and again  till you can't  dismiss it as  coincidence, is  one of the  most
     powerful methods for  awakening that awareness.  It makes  no sense to  say
     that  the  direct  experience  and  exercise  of  our  indwelling  divinity
     distracts from the Great Work.

          Indeed, it is this intimate connection between our magic and our
     self-realization  that our ethics protect. Wrongful use of magic will choke
     the channel. No short term gain could ever compensate for that.

               The karmic argument againstpractical workings seems to meto arise
     from a  paranoid and  defeatist  world view.  Even if  we  assume that  the
     hardships in this life were put there by the Gods for a reason, how  can we
     be so sure that the reason was punishment? Perhaps instead of penance to be
     endured, our difficulties are challenges to be met. Coping and dealing with
     our  problems, learning magical and mundane  skills, changing ourselves and
     our world for the better - in short, growing up - is that not what the Gods
     of joy and freedom want from us?

          One of the most radically different things about a polytheistic belief
     system is that each one of us has the right, and the need, to choose which
     God/desses will be the focus of our worship. We make these choices knowing
     that whatever energies we invoke most often in ritual will shape our own
     further  growth. Spiritual practices are a means of self-programming. So we
     are responsible for what we worship in a way that people who take their One
     God as a given are not.

          Think about this: what kind of Power actively wants us to submit and
     suffer, and objects when we develop skills to improve our own lives? Not a
     Being I'd want to invite around too often!

               So it will not workfor us to rule out projectivemagic completely;
     nor   should   we.  Total   prohibitions  are   as  thoughtless   as  total
     permissiveness or blind obedience. Ethical and spiritual adults ought to be
     able to make  distinctions and well-reasoned choices. I offer  here a start
     toward analyzing what kinds of magic are not ethical for us.


               Baneful magicis magic done forthe explicit purposeof causing harm
     to  another  person.  Usually  the  reason  for  it  is  revenge,  and  the
     rationalization is justice. People who defend the practice of baneful magic
     often ask "but wouldn't you join in cursing another Hitler?"

          For adults there is no rule without exceptions. If you think you would
     never torture somebody,  consider this scenario: in  just half an  hour the
     bomb will go  off, killing everybody in the city,  and this terrorist knows
     where it is hidden.... 


                                                                             504

          It's a bad mistake to base your ethics on wildly unlikely cases, since
     none of us honestly knows how we would react in that kind of extreme.
     Reasonable ethical statements are statements about the behaviors we  expect
     of ourselves under normally predictable circumstances.

               We all getreally angry on occasion, and sometimeswith good cause.
     Then  revenge can  seem like no  more than  simple justice. The  anger is a
     normal, healthy human reaction, and should not be repressed. But there's no
     more need to  act it  out in magic  than in physical  violence. Instead  of
     going for revenge - and invoking the karmic consequences of baneful magic -
     identify what  you really need.  For example,  if your anger  comes from  a
     feeling  that  you  have  been  attacked  or violated,  what  you  need  is
     protection  and safe  space.  Work for  the positive  goal, it's  both more
     effective and safer.

          The  consequences of baneful magic are simply the logical, natural and
     inevitable psychological effects.  Even in that rare and  extreme situation
     when you may decide you really do have to  use magic to give Hitler a heart
     attack, it means  you are choosing by  the same choice to  accept the act's
     karma. Magical attack hurts the attacker first.

          The only way I know how to do magic is by use of my imagination, by
     visualizing  or otherwise  actively  imagining the  end  I want,  and  then
     projecting that  goal with  the energy of  emotional/physiological arousal.
     All the techniques I know either help me to imagine more specifically or to
     project more  strongly. So the  only way  I can send  out harm is  by first
     experiencing  that harm  within my  own imagination.  Instant  and absolute
     karma - the natural, logical and inevitable outcomes of our own choices.

               I would think, also, that somebody dumb enough to dosuch workings
     often  would  soon  lose the  ability  to  imagine  specifically, as  their
     sensitivity  dulled in  sheer self-defense.  That callusing  effect is  the
     reality behind the pious proverb that says "if you abuse it, She'll take it
     away." 

               But not every othermagician is ethical. Psychic attacksdo happen.
     Should we not defend ourselves? Of course we should. Leaving ourselves open
     to psychic  attack is no good example of the autonomy and assertiveness our
     chosen Gods  expect. But first, how can we be sure what we are experiencing
     really is psychic attack?

               Thefantasy ofpsychic attackis often aconvenient excusethat allows
     us to avoid looking at our own shortcomings. When lack of rest or improper
     nutrition  is the cause  of illness, or  a project isn't  completed on time
     because of distraction,  it's a real  temptation to  put the blame  outside
     ourselves.   Doing this too  easily betrays our  autonomy just as  badly as
     meek  submission to attack does. Then, to compound matters, projected blame
     becomes  an excuse for unjust revenge --  and that is baneful magic without
     excuse.

               Once in a rare while, some fool really does tryto throw a whammy.
     It's hard to predict when you might be targeted. Passive shields are always
     a good idea. Like a mirror, these are totally inactive until somebody sends
     unwelcome energy. Then a shield will protect you completely and bounce back
     whatever  is being  thrown. You  may not  even know  consciously when  your
     shield is working, but the result is perfect justice.


                                                                             505

          Perfect justice; elegant and efficient. You won't hurt anybody out of
     paranoia or by mistake. And perfect protection, even though we do not have
     perfect knowledge.

               Bindings, according to some, arecompletely defensive. They do not
     harm, only restrain. But imagine yourself  being bound - perhaps by someone
     who believes themselves justified - and notice the feeling of impotence and
     frustration. Binding is bane from the viewpoint of the bound.

          Even if restraint were truly not harm, bindings are just plain poor
     protection. They target  a particular person or group. What  if you suspect
     the wrong person?  Somebody harmless is bound  and your actual attacker  is
     not bound.   Shields, which cover you, not your  supposed enemy, will cover
     you against any enemy, known or unknown.

               So, baneful magic,  besides being  painful in the  short run  and
     crippling  in the long  run, is never  necessary. There are  better ways of
     self protection, and retribution is the business of the Gods.


               Coercive magicis magicthat targets anotherperson to makethem give
     us something we want or need. When most people think of the "Magic Power of
     Witchcraft," this is what they have in mind.

          The spell to make the teacher give you a good grade, or the supervisor
     give you  a good evaluation,  the spell  to make the  personnel officer  or
     renting  agent choose  you, the  spell to  attract that  cute guy,  all are
     examples of coercive magic.

               So, what's  wrong with high grades,  a good job, a  raise, a nice
     apartment and a sexy lover? There's  nothing at all wrong with those goals.
     An it harm none, do what ye will. As long as nobody is hurt, go for it! But
     don't strive toward good ends by coercive means.

          Although there is no deliberate intent to do harm or cause pain in
     coercive  workings, other people are  treated as pawns.  Their autonomy and
     their interests are ignored.

               For Pagans, to do this is total hypocrisy. We profess to follow a
     religion of immanence, one that  places ultimate meaning and value in  this
     life on  this Earth,  here and now.  We claim  to see  every living  thing,
     humans  included, as a sacred manifestation. To do honor to this indwelling
     divinity, we  place great value  on our own  personal autonomy. How  can we
     then justify treating other people as objects for our use?

          Nor is it harmless. Forcing the will, controlling the independent
     judgement of another human being, is harm. Once again, empathy leads to
     understanding. Just imagine you are the person whose will and judgement is
     being externally controlled. How  does puppethood feel? From the  viewpoint
     of the target, the harm is palpable.


                                                                             506

               The Pagan and Wiccan community asa whole is also hurt by coercive
     magic.   One  of the  main  reasons people  fear and  hate  Witches is  our
     reputation for controlling others.  This is an  old, dirty lie, created  by
     the  invading   religion  in  an   attempt  to  discredit   the  indigenous
     competition. Today,  that reputation  is mostly  perpetuated by  people who
     claim to be "our own," who teach  unethical coercive magic by mail order to
     strangers whose ethical sensitivity cannot be evaluated long  distance. May
     the Gods preserve the Craft!

               People who are connected to thesituation, but invisible to us,may
     also be  seriously hurt: the  cute guy's  fiancee, the other  applicant for
     that job.  What  you think of as a  working designed only to bring  good to
     yourself can bring serious harm to innocent third parties, and the karma of
     their pain will be on you.

               That  isn't the only way an incomplete  view of the situation can
     backfire.  There's  a traditional saying that goes, "be  careful about what
     you ask  for, because  that's exactly  what you will  get." What  if he  is
     gorgeous,  but  abusive?   What  if  the  apartment  house is  structurally
     unsound?  Better to state  your legitimate needs  (love in my  life, a nice
     place to live) and let the Gods deal with the details.

               Finally,remember this: asking specificallylimits us towhat we now
     know or what  we can now imagine.  But I remember a  time when I could  not
     have imagined  being a priestess.  What if  the cute guy  in the office  is
     perfectly OK, but your absolutely perfect soul-mate will be in the A+P next
     Wednesday? The more specifically targeted your magic is, the more you limit
     yourself to a life of tautology and missed chances.

               And  beyond all the scenario spinning lies the instant karma, the
     natural,  logical and inevitable consequence  of the act.  It's more subtle
     than in the  case of baneful magic, since you are not trying to imagine and
     project pain, but the damage is still real.

          Every time you treat another human being as a thing to be pushed and
     pulled around for your  convenience and pleasure, you are  reinforcing your
     own alienation.  The attitude of being  removed from and  superior to other
     people takes you out of community. As the attitude strengthens, so will the
     behavior it  engenders. The  long term  result of  coercive magic,  as with
     mundane forms of coercion, is isolation and loneliness.

               Are youbeginning to think thatmagic is useless?Did I justrule out
     all the good stuff: love charms, job magic, spells  for good grades? Not at
     all. It is not only ethical but good for you to do lots of magic to improve
     your  own life. Whenever it  works you will  get more than you  asked for -
     because along with whatever you asked for comes one more experience of your
     own effectiveness, your power-from-within.

               Work on yourself and your own needs and desires without targeting
     other people. Then feel free! Ask for what you want. Visualize it and raise
     power for it and act in accordance on the  material plane. "I need a caring
     and  horny  lover with  a  good  sense of  humor."  "I  want an  affordable
     apartment near where my coven meets with a tree outside my window." "I need
     to be at my best when I take that exam next week." Fulfill your dreams, and
     sometimes let the Gods surprise you with gifts beyond your dreams.


                                                                             507

               Manipulative magic is magicthat targets another person forwhat we
     think is "their own good," without regard for their opinions in the matter.
     In the general culture around us, this is normal. As you read this, you may
     have some friend or relative praying  for you to be "saved" from  your evil
     Pagan ways  and returned to the fold of their preference. These people mean
     you well.  By their own  lights, they are attempting  to heal you.  We work
     from a very different thealogical base.

               Aspolytheists, weaffirm thediversity of thedivine andthe divinity
     of diversity. If  there is no one, true, right and  only way in general, do
     we dare to  assume that there is one  obvious right choice for a  person in
     any  given situation? If more than  one choice may be  "right," how can one
     person presume they know what another person would want without asking them
     first?

          No life situation ever looks the same from outside as it does to the
     person who is experiencing it.  Are you sure you  even have all the  facts?
     Are  you fully aware of  all the emotional  entanglements involved? Perhaps
     that  illness  is  the only  way  they  have  of  getting rest  or  getting
     attention. Perhaps  they stay in that  dead end job because  it leaves them
     more energy to concentrate on their music. How do you know till you ask?

               And,to furthercomplicate theanalysis, it'spossible thatthe person
     you are  trying to  help  would agree  with you  about  the most  desirable
     outcome, but fears and hates the very idea of magic. They have as much of a
     right to keep magic  out of their own life, as you have  to make it part of
     yours!

               Ourreligion teaches thatthe sacredlives withineach person,that we
     can hear the Lady's voice for ourselves if we only learn to listen. "... If
     that which you seek,  you find not within yourself, you will  never find it
     without."   In  behavioral terms,  when you  take another  person's opinion
     about their  own life seriously, you  are reinforcing them in  thinking and
     choosing for themselves. The more you  do this, the more you encourage them
     to listen for the sacred inner voice.

          Conversely, whenever you ignore or override a person's feelings about
     their own life,  you are  discounting those feelings  and discouraging  the
     kind  of internal  attention that  can keep  the channels  to wisdom  open.
     Although well-intentioned  meddling may actually help somebody in the short
     run,  in the longer  run it trains  them to dependency  and indecision. Few
     intentional  banes damage as severely. This is especially true because even
     the  untrained and unaware will instinctively resist overt ill-will, but in
     our culture we are trained to receive "expert" interference with gratitude.

               Check byasking yourself, "who'sin charge here?" Theanswer to that
     will  tell  you whether  you are  basically  empowering or  undermining the
     person you intend to help. 

               And,  as  usual, the  effects go  both  ways. The  same uninvited
     intervention
     that  fosters passivity  in  the recipient  will  foster arrogance  in  the
     "rescuer."   It's control and ego-inflation masked as generosity. It's very
     seductive.


                                                                             508

               If you makethis a habit, youwill come to believethat other people
     are  incompetent and powerless. Then what  happens when you need help? Your
     contempt  will make it  impossible for you  to see what  resources surround
     you.  Manipulative magic is ultimately just as alienating as coercive magic
     - and it's a much prettier trap!

          The way to avoid the trap is to do no working affecting another person
     without  that person's explicit  permission. Proteans are  pledged to this,
     and I think it's a good idea for anybody.

               You don'tneed to waitpassively forthe person toask. It'sperfectly
     all right to offer, as long as you are willing to sometimes accept "no" for
     your answer.  For the person who believes s/he is unworthy or who is simply
     too shy,  offering help is itself a gift. Taking their opinion seriously is
     an even greater gift: respect.

               Therule is thatwhenever itis in anyway physically possibleto ask,
     you must ask. If it's not important enough to pay long distance charges, it
     certainly  isn't important enough to violate a friend's autonomy. If asking
     is literally not possible, then and only then, here are a few exceptions:

               Sometimesan illness or injuryhappens very suddenly,and the person
     is unconscious or in a coma before you could possibly ask them. If you know
     that  this person is generally comfortable  with magic, you may do workings
     to  keep their  basic body  systems  working and  allow the  normal healing
     process  the time  it needs.  If they  are opposed  to magic,  for whatever
     reason, back off!

               Traditionally, anunconscious personis understood tobe temporarily
     out  of  their  body. Maintaining  their  body  in  habitable condition  is
     preserving  their option,  not choosing  for them. Doing  maintenance magic
     requires a lot  of sensitivity. At some  point, the time may  come when you
     should  stop and  let  the  person go  on.  Be sure  to  use  some kind  of
     divination to help you stay aware.

          This is a hard road. It may be your lover, your child, lying there
     helpless. Any  normal human being  would be tempted  to drag them  back, to
     force them to stay regardless of what is truly best for them, regardless of
     what they want. Don't repress these feelings, they do no  harm, even though
     your  actions might.  It takes  great strength  and non-possessive  love to
     recognize that your loved one knows their own need. You may be calling them
     back to a crippled  body, to a life of  pain. You may be calling  them back
     from the ecstasy of  the Goddess. And  this is no more  your right than  it
     would be to murder them.

          If a person is temporarily not reachable, you may charge up a physical
     object, such as  an appropriate talisman or some  incense. When you present
     it to them,  give them a  full explanation. It is  their choice whether  to
     keep or use  your gift. By interposing an object between  the magic and the
     target in  this way, you  can work the  magic in  Circle, with the  coven's
     power to draw on, and still get the person's permission before the magic is
     triggered.


                                                                             509

               With all these rulesabout permission, perhaps it would besafer to
     work  only on ourselves?  Safer, yes, but  not nearly as  good. If you have
     permission, you may do any working for another person that you might do for
     yourself.  Coercive magic is  just as unacceptable when somebody  else asks
     for it, and you may not do manipulative magic on your friend's mother, even
     at  your  friend's  request. The  permission  must  come  from the  magic's
     intended target and from nobody else. With proper permission, working magic
     for others is good for all concerned.

               Every act of magic has two effects. One is the direct effect, the
     healing or  prosperity working  or whatever  was intended.  The other  is a
     minute change in the mind and the heart of the person who does the working.
     Everything  we  experience,  and especially  everything  that  we  do in  a
     wholehearted and focused way  - the only way effective magic  can be done -
     changes  us. Each  experience leaves  its tiny  trace,  but the  traces are
     cumulative. They mold the person we will become. Our karma is our choice.

          Instant karma can also be good karma. Logical, natural and inevitable
     outcomes can be desirable. When you send out good, what you send it with is
     love. Love is the driving force. When you let love flow freely, the channel
     down to love's wellspring stays clear and open. When you send out good, you
     direct  it along the web  of person-to-person connection,  and awareness of
     that web is reinforced. The totality of that web is the basis of community.

          When you send out good it feels good. In the same way that sending out
     bane  requires  imagining pain,  sending  out  blessing requires  imagining
     pleasure, strongly and specifically.  And, when you send out good, just the
     same  as  when  you call  it  to  yourself,  you  reinforce your  sense  of
     effectiveness  in  the  world. Blessings  grow  in  the  fertile ground  of
     mutuality, to the benefit of all.


               A pattern isbecoming visible.In baneful magic,the magicianintends
     to harm  the target.  In coercive  magic, the intent  toward the  target is
     neutral.  In manipulative  magic, the  magician  actually means  the target
     well. But  no matter how  different the intent  may be, in  all three cases
     magic is done to affect another person without that person's permission. In
     all  three cases, the target, the practitioner and ultimately the community
     are all  hurt. And in all  three cases, there are safer  and more effective
     ways to reach the valid goals that we mean to aim for.

               So,  perhaps there is a descriptive word that covers all wrongful
     magical  workings after  all.   How  about  "non-consensual" or  "invasive"
     magic?


               There's one thing left to examine: the paradox of making rules to
     protect personal autonomy.

          If we make some of our choices as a community, by discussing things
     together  and  arriving  at  a  common  understanding  about  what  magical
     behaviors are  acceptable among us,  then we choose  and shape the  kind of
     community we become.

               Or wecould give up ourright to choose,because we feelwe shouldn't
     tell  each other what  to do.  Some people  believe that  a refusal  to set
     community standards promotes personal autonomy. It never has before.

               Appeals toindividual rights can bereal seductive. Noneof us wants
     Big Brother looking  over our shoulders, telling us what to do "for our own


                                                                             510

     good."   For Witches in particular  - members of a  religious minority with
     bad  image problems -  this is a  very legitimate fear.  But make sure when
     somebody talks about "rights"  without specifying something like "religious
     practice rights" or  "the right to consensual sex," that  you find out just
     what "rights" they mean.

               Rhetoric about"rugged individualism" hasbeen usedin recenthistory
     to  fast talk us into  letting the rich  or strong dominate  all our lives.
     Without anything  to stop them,  they can destroy  the forestland, or  deny
     jobs or  apartments to  "cultists." Personal  autonomy for  most  of us  is
     diminished when we allow that.

               Magic can be used for dominance,just the same as muscle or money.
     There is no difference, ethically, between the magical and the mundane.  We
     are not obligated to tolerate power trippers among us. We are not obligated
     to  run our own community by the  slogans and ground rules of the dominator
     culture.

               Thinking  about "rights," or about "laws" for that matter, in the
     abstract leads to "all or nothing" thinking - immature and slogan driven. I
     don't think we should ever "just  say" anything. We need a deeper and  more
     mature analysis.   We need to  ask questions like "right  to do what?"  and
     "law  against what?"  We need  to get away  from absolutes  and to  look in
     practical terms at the advantages or disadvantages of our choices.

               Once more,our religion itself showsus the way tosteer between the
     false choices. "An  it harm none,  do what you will."   What a  person does
     that affects only herself - magical or mundane - is truly nobody's business
     but  her  own. For  example, consensual  sexual  behavior affects  only the
     participants. But toxic waste dumping affects everybody in the watershed.

               As  long as we  look at behavior  in terms of  private choices or
     individual will, we obscure the distinction that really makes a difference.
     If we're serious about wanting to give each of us the most possible control
     over our  own  lives, then  decisions  should be  made  by all  the  people
     affected by the behavior - not just by the people acting.

          As soon as another person is magically targeted, that other person is
     affected. If we allow such targeting without consent, we are not supporting
     personal autonomy, we are subverting it!

               When the behavior begins to affect us all - for example when real
     estate  development threatens  the  salt marshes,  and  ultimately the  air
     supply -  or, very specifically,  when invasive  magic erodes the  trust we
     need to  work together -  then we have  a right to  protect ourselves  as a
     community. No ideology should  turn us into passive victims  when something
     we hold precious stands to be destroyed.

               Invasive magichurts the targetfirst, and soonthe actor, butin the
     long run  it hurts all of  us. It's been so  long since we've  been able to
     meet  together,  share  our knowledge,  help  one  another  in need.  Pagan
     community is very new,  and still very  fragile. It can  only grow in  safe
     space.


                                                                             511

               The People of  this Land forbade skirmishes  around the pipestone
     quarries, keeping that sacred source open to all. Otherwise, no sane person
     would go there, and the Old Ways would wither. For much the same reason, we
     cannot tolerate poppets in our council meetings.

          An atmosphere of coercion and manipulation and magical duels does not
     nurture community. Eventually, for self protection, the gentle will either
     change  or  go away.  We could  lose what  we  have misguidedly  refused to
     protect.

           As within, so without: our karma is our choice.

             I'm Dick Sutphen andthis tape is a studio-recorded,expanded version
     of a talk  I delivered  at the  World Congress  of Professional  Hypnotists
     Convention  in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although  the tape carries a copyright to
     protect it from  unlawful duplication for sale by  other companies, in this
     case,  I invite  individuals to  make copies  and give  them to  friends or
     anyone in a position to communicate this information.

         Although I've been interviewed about the subject on many local and
     regional radio and TV talk shows, large-scale mass communication appears to
     be blocked, since it could result in suspicion or investigation of the very
     media presenting it or the sponsors that support the media. Some government
     agencies  do  not  want  this  information  generally  known.  Nor  do  the
     Born-Again Christian movement, cults, and many human-potential trainings.

             Everything I will relate only exposes the surface of the problem. I
     don't know how the misuse of these techniques can be stopped. I don't think
     it is possible to  legislate against that which  often cannot be  detected;
     and if those who legislate are using these techniques, there is little hope
     of  affecting laws  to govern  usage.  I do  know  that the  first step  to
     initiate change  is to generate interest. In  this case, that will probably
     only result from an underground effort.

             In talkingabout this subject, I am talking about my own business. I
     know  it, and  I know  how  effective it  can  be. I  produce hypnosis  and
     subliminal tapes and,  in some of my seminars, I  use conversion tactics to
     assist participants to become independent and self-sufficient. But, anytime
     I  use  these techniques,  I point  out  that I  am  using them,  and those
     attending have  a choice  to participate  or not. They  also know  what the
     desired result of participation will be.


                                                                             513

         So, to begin, I want to state the most basic of all facts about
     brainwashing:  IN  THE  ENTIRE  HISTORY  OF  MAN,  NO  ONE  HAS  EVER  BEEN
     BRAINWASHED  AND REALIZED, OR BELIEVED, THAT HE HAD BEEN BRAINWASHED. Those
     who  have   been  brainwashed   will  usually  passionately   defend  their
     manipulators,  claiming they have simply  been "shown the light"   . . . or
     have been transformed in miraculous ways.

     The Birth of Conversion

        CONVERSION is a "nice" word for BRAINWASHING . . . and any study of
     brainwashing  has  to  begin  with  a  study  of  Christian  revivalism  in
     eighteenth  century  America.  Apparently,  Jonathan  Edwards  accidentally
     discovered  the   techniques  during  a   religious  crusade  in   1735  in
     Northampton, Massachusetts.   By inducing guilt and  acute apprehension and
     by increasing the  tension, the  "sinners" attending  his revival  meetings
     would break down and completely submit. Technically, what Edwards was doing
     was creating  conditions that wipe the  brain slate clean so  that the mind
     accepts new programming. The problem  was that the new input was  negative.
     He would tell them, "You're a sinner!  You're destined for hell!"

             As  a result,  one person committed  suicide and  another attempted
     suicide.   And the neighbors  of the  suicidal converts related  that they,
     too,  were  affected  so deeply  that,  although  they  had found  "eternal
     salvation,"  they were obsessed with  a diabolical temptation  to end their
     own lives. 

             Oncea preacher, cult leader,manipulator or authority figure creates
     the brain phase to wipe the  brain-slate clean, his subjects are wide open.
     New input, in the form of suggestion, can be substituted for their previous
     ideas.   Because Edwards didn't turn his  message positive until the end of
     the revival, many accepted  the negative suggestions and acted,  or desired
     to act, upon them.

         Charles J. Finney was another Christian revivalist who used the same
     techniques four years later in mass religious conversions in New York. The
     techniques are still being used today by Christian revivalists, cults,
     human-potential  trainings, some  business rallies,  and the  United States
     Armed Services . . . to name just a few. 

             Let me point out here that I don't  think most revivalist preachers
     realize  or know  they are  using brainwashing  techniques. Edwards  simply
     stumbled upon a technique that really worked, and others copied it and have
     continued to copy it for over two hundred years. And the more sophisticated
     our knowledge and technology  become, the more effective the  conversion. I
     feel strongly that this is one of the major reasons for the increasing rise
     in Christian  fundamentalism, especially the televised  variety, while most
     of the orthodox religions are declining.

     The Three Brain Phases

         The Christians may have been the first to successfully formulate
     brainwashing, but we have to look to Pavlov, the Russian scientist, for a
     technical explanation. In the early 1900s, his work with animals opened the
     door to further investigations with humans. After the revolution in Russia,
     Lenin was quick  to see the potential of applying  Pavlov's research to his
     own ends.


                                                                             514

         Three distinct and progressive states of transmarginal inhibition were
     identified by Pavlov. The first is the EQUIVALENT phase, in which the brain
     gives the same response to both strong and weak stimuli. The second is the
     PARADOXICAL  phase, in  which  the brain  responds  more actively  to  weak
     stimuli than to strong.  And the third is  the ULTRA-PARADOXICAL phase,  in
     which conditioned responses  and behavior  patterns turn  from positive  to
     negative or from negative to positive.

             With  the progression through each  phase, the degree of conversion
     becomes more effective and complete. The way to achieve conversion are many
     and varied, but the usual first step in religious or political brainwashing
     is to work  on the emotions of  an individual or group until  they reach an
     abnormal level of anger, fear, excitement, or nervous tension.

             Theprogressive result of thismental condition isto impair judgement
     and increase suggestibility. The more this condition can be maintained or
     intensified,  the more  it compounds.  Once catharsis,  or the  first brain
     phase, is reached,  the complete mental  takeover becomes easier.  Existing
     mental  programming can  be  replaced with  new  patterns of  thinking  and
     behavior.

         Other often-used physiological weapons to modify normal brain functions
     are fasting, radical or high  sugar diets, physical discomforts, regulation
     of  breathing,  mantra chanting  in meditation,  the disclosure  of awesome
     mysteries,  special  lighting and  sound  effects,  programmed response  to
     incense, or intoxicating drugs.

             The sameresults can beobtained in contemporarypsychiatric treatment
     by  electric shock  treatments and  even by  purposely lowering  a person's
     blood sugar level with insulin injections.

             Before I talk about exactlyhow some of the techniques areapplied, I
     want to point  out that hypnosis and conversion tactics  are two distinctly
     different  things--and that  conversion techniques  are far  more powerful.
     However, the two are often mixed . . . with powerful results.

     How Revivalist Preachers Work

         If you'd like to see a revivalist preacher at work, there are probably
     several in your city. Go to the church or tent early and sit in the rear,
     about three-quarters of the way back. Most likely repetitive music will be
     played while the people come in for the service. A repetitive beat, ideally
     ranging from 45 to 72 beats per minute (a rhythm close to the beat of the
     human heart), is very hypnotic and  can generate an eyes-open altered state
     of consciousness in a very high percentage  of people. And, once you are in
     an alpha state, you are at least 25 times as suggestible as you would be in
     full beta consciousness. The music is probably the same for every  service,
     or incorporates the  same beat,  and many  of the  people will  go into  an
     altered   state   almost   immediately   upon   entering   the   sanctuary.
     Subconsciously,  they recall their state of mind from previous services and
     respond according to the post-hypnotic programming.

         Watch the people waiting for the service to begin. Many will exhibit
     external signs of trance--body relaxation and slightly dilated eyes. Often,
     they begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air while sitting
     in their chairs.  Next, the  assistant pastor  will probably  come out.  He
     usually speaks with a pretty good "voice roll."

     Voice Roll Technique


                                                                             515

         A "voice roll" is a patterned, paced style used by hypnotists when
     inducing  a trance. It  is also used  by many lawyers,  several of whom are
     highly trained hypnotists,  when they desire to entrench  a point firmly in
     the  minds of  the jurors. A  voice roll can  sound as if  the speaker were
     talking  to the  beat of  a metronome  or it  may sound  as though  he were
     emphasizing every word  in a  monotonous, patterned style.  The words  will
     usually  be delivered at the rate of 45  to 60 beats per minute, maximizing
     the hypnotic effect.

         Now the assistant pastor begins the "build-up" process. He induces an
     altered state of consciousness and/or begins to generate the excitement and
     the expectations  of the audience. Next,  a group of young  women in "sweet
     and pure" chiffon dresses might  come out to sing a song. Gospel  songs are
     great for building  excitement and INVOLVEMENT. In the  middle of the song,
     one of the girls might be "smitten by the spirit" and fall down or react as
     if  possessed by  the  Holy Spirit.  This  very effectively  increases  the
     intensity in the  room. At this point, hypnosis and  conversion tactics are
     being mixed. And the result is the audience's attention span is now totally
     focused upon the communication while  the environment becomes more exciting
     or tense.

             Right about  this time, when an eyes-open mass-induced alpha mental
     state has been  achieved, they will  usually pass  the collection plate  or
     basket.  In  the  background,  a  45-beat-per-minute voice  roll  from  the
     assistant preacher might exhort, "Give to God . . . Give to God . . .  Give
     to God .  . ." And the audience  does give. God may not get  the money, but
     his already wealthy representative will.

             Next, the fire-and-brimstone preacher will come out.He induces fear
     and increases the tension by talking about "the devil," "going to hell," or
     the forthcoming Armageddon.

         In the last such rally I attended, the preacher talked about the blood
     that would soon be running out of every faucet in the land. He was also
     obsessed with  a "bloody axe of God," which everyone had seen hanging above
     the pulpit the  previous week. I  have no doubt  that everyone saw  it--the
     power of suggestion given to hundreds of people in hypnosis assures that at
     least 10 to 25 percent would see whatever he suggested they see.

         In most revivalist gatherings, "testifying" or "witnessing" usually
     follows the fear-based  sermon. People from  the audience come up  on stage
     and  relate their  stories. "I  was crippled  and now  I can walk!"  "I had
     arthritis  and  now it's  gone!" It  is  a psychological  manipulation that
     works. After listening  to numerous case histories of  miraculous healings,
     the average  guy in the  audience with a  minor problem is  sure he  can be
     healed.  The  room is  charged with  fear,  guilt, intense  excitement, and
     expectations.


                                                                             516

             Now thosewho want tobe healed are frequentlylined up aroundthe edge
     of the room, or they are told to come down to the front. The preacher might
     touch them  on the head firmly  and scream, "Be healed!"  This releases the
     psychic energy  and, for many, catharsis results. Catharsis is a purging of
     repressed  emotions. Individuals  might  cry, fall  down  or even  go  into
     spasms. And if catharsis is effected, they stand a chance  of being healed.
     In  catharsis  (one  of the  three  brain  phases  mentioned earlier),  the
     brain-slate is temporarily wiped clean and the new suggestion is accepted.

             For some, the healing may be permanent. For many, it will last four
     days to  a week,  which is,  incidentally, how  long a  hypnotic suggestion
     given to a  somnambulistic subject will usually  last. Even if the  healing
     doesn't last,  if they come  back every week,  the power of  suggestion may
     continually override the problem  . . . or sometimes, sadly,  it can mask a
     physical problem which could prove to be very detrimental to the individual
     in the long run.

             I'm not saying that legitimate healings do not take place. They do.
     Maybe the individual was ready to let  go of the negativity that caused the
     problem in the  first place; maybe  it was the work  of God. Yet  I contend
     that it can be explained with existing knowledge of brain/mind function.

         The techniques and staging will vary from church to church. Many use
     "speaking in tongues" to generate catharsis in some while the spectacle
     creates intense excitement in the observers.

         The use of hypnotic techniques by religions is sophisticated, and
     professionals are assuring  that they become even more effective.  A man in
     Los Angeles is designing, building, and reworking a  lot of churches around
     the  country. He tells  ministers what  they need and  how to use  it. This
     man's  track record indicates that the congregation and the monetary income
     will double if  the minister follows his instructions. He admits that about
     80 percent of his efforts are in the sound system and lighting.

             Powerful soundand the properuse of lightingare ofprimary importance
     in inducing an  altered state  of consciousness--I've been  using them  for
     years in my  own seminars. However, my participants are  fully aware of the
     process and what they can expect as a result of their participation.

     Six Conversion Techniques

         Cults and human-potential organizations are always looking for new
     converts. To  attain them,  they must also  create a brain-phase.  And they
     often need to do it within a short space  of time--a weekend, or maybe even
     a day.  The  following are the six primary techniques  used to generate the
     conversion.

             The meeting or training takesplace in an area whereparticipants are
     cut  off from the outside world.  This may be any place:  a private home, a
     remote or  rural setting, or even  a hotel ballroom where  the participants
     are allowed only limited bathroom usage.  In human-potential trainings, the
     controllers  will  give a  lengthy talk  about  the importance  of "keeping
     agreements"  in life.   The participants are  told that if  they don't keep
     agreements,  their  life  will  never  work.  It's  a  good  idea  to  keep
     agreements, but the controllers  are subverting a positive human  value for
     selfish purposes. The participants vow to themselves and their trainer that
     they will  keep their agreements.  Anyone who does not  will be intimidated
     into agreement or  forced to leave. The  next step is to  agree to complete
     training,  thus  assuring   a  high  percentage  of   conversions  for  the
     organizations. They will USUALLY  have to agree not  to take drugs,  smoke,


                                                                             517

     and  sometimes not to eat  . . .  or they are given  such short meal breaks
     that it creates tension. The real reason for the agreements is to alter
     internal chemistry, which generates anxiety and hopefully causes at least a
     slight malfunction of the nervous system, which in turn increases the
     conversion potential.

         Before the gathering is complete, the agreements will be used to ensure
     that  the  new  converts  go  out  and  find  new  participants.  They  are
     intimidated  into agreeing to do so before they leave. Since the importance
     of keeping agreements is so high  on their priority list, the converts will
     twist  the  arms of  everyone  they  know,  attempting  to talk  them  into
     attending  a  free introductory  session offered  at a  future date  by the
     organization. The  new converts are  zealots. In fact, the  inside term for
     merchandising the largest and  most successful human-potential training is,
     "sell it by zealot!"

         At least a million people are graduates and a good percentage have been
     left with a mental activation button that assures their future loyalty and
     assistance  if the  guru  figure or  organization  calls. Think  about  the
     potential  political  implications  of  hundreds of  thousands  of  zealots
     programmed to campaign for their guru.

         Be wary of an organization of this type that offers follow-up sessions
     after  the  seminar.  Follow-up  sessions  might   be  weekly  meetings  or
     inexpensive seminars given on  a regular basis which the  organization will
     attempt to talk you into  taking--or any regularly scheduled event  used to
     maintain  control.  As the  early  Christian  revivalists found,  long-term
     control is dependent upon a good follow-up system.

             Alright.  Now,  let's look  at  the second  tip-off  that indicates
     conversion tactics are  being used.  A schedule is  maintained that  causes
     physical and mental fatigue.  This is primarily accomplished by  long hours
     in  which the  participants  are given  no  opportunity for  relaxation  or
     reflection.

             The third tip-off: techniquesused to increasethe tension in theroom
     or environment.

             Number  four: Uncertainty.  I  could spend  hours relating  various
     techniques  to increase  tension and  generate uncertainty.  Basically, the
     participants are concerned about being "put on the spot" or  encountered by
     the trainers, guilt feelings  are played upon, participants are  tempted to
     verbally relate their innermost secrets to the other participants or forced
     to take  part in activities that emphasize removing their masks. One of the
     most successful  human-potential seminars forces the  participants to stand
     on a stage in front of the entire audience while being verbally attacked by
     the trainers. A public opinion poll, conducted a few years ago, showed that
     the number one most-fearful  situation an individual could encounter  is to
     speak to an audience. It ranked above window washing outside the 85th floor
     of an  office  building. So  you  can imagine  the  fear and  tension  this
     situation generates within the participants. Many faint, but most cope with
     the stress by  mentally going away. They literally go  into an alpha state,
     which automatically makes them  many times as suggestible as  they normally
     are.  And  another  loop   of  the  downward  spiral  into   conversion  is
     successfully effected.

             The  fifth clue  that  conversion tactics  are  being used  is  the
     introduction  of jargon--new terms that have meaning only to the "insiders"
     who participate.  Vicious  language is also frequently used,  purposely, to
     make participants uncomfortable.


                                                                             518

             The final tip-off isthat there isno humor in thecommunications . ..
     at least until the participants are converted. Then, merry-making and humor
     are highly  desirable  as symbols  of  the new  joy  the participants  have
     supposedly "found."

         I'm not saying that good does not result from participation in such
     gatherings. It  can and does. But I  contend it is important  for people to
     know what has happened and  to be aware that continual involvement  may not
     be in their best interest.

             Over the years,I've conductedprofessional seminars toteach peopleto
     be hypnotists, trainers, and counselors. I've had many of those who conduct
     trainings and rallies come  to me and  say, "I'm here  because I know  that
     what I'm  doing works, but  I don't know why."  After showing them  how and
     why, many have  gotten out of the business  or have decided to  approach it
     differently or in a much more loving and supportive manner.

             Many of these trainers havebecome personal friends, and it scaresus
     all to  have experienced the  power of one person  with a microphone  and a
     room full of  people. Add a  little charisma and  you can  count on a  high
     percentage of  conversions. The  sad truth  is that  a  high percentage  of
     people want to give away their power--they are true "believers"!

             Cult gatheringsor human-potential trainings arean ideal environment
     to observe first-hand what is technically called the  "Stockholm Syndrome."
     This is a situation in which those who are intimidated, controlled, or made
     to suffer, begin to love, admire, and even sometimes sexually desire their
     controllers or captors.

             But let me inject a wordof warning here: If you think youcan attend
     such  gatherings and  not be  affected, you are  probably wrong.  A perfect
     example is the case of a woman who went to Haiti on a Guggenheim Fellowship
     to  study  Haitian  Voodoo.  In  her report,  she  related  how  the  music
     eventually  induced uncontrollable bodily movement and  an altered state of
     consciousness.  Although she  understood  the process  and thought  herself
     above it,  when she began to  feel herself become vulnerable  to the music,
     she  attempted to  fight it  and turned  away.  Anger or  resistance almost
     always assures conversion.  A few  moments later she  was possessed by  the
     music  and began  dancing in a  trance around  the Voodoo  meeting house. A
     brain phase  had been induced  by the music  and excitement, and  she awoke
     feeling  reborn. The only hope  of attending such  gatherings without being
     affected is to be  a Buddha and allow  no positive or negative emotions  to
     surface. Few people are capable of such detachment.


                                                                             519

             Before I go on,let's go backto the six tip-offsto conversion. Iwant
     to mention the United States Government and military boot  camp. The Marine
     Corps talks about breaking men down before "rebuilding" them as new men--as
     marines!  Well,  that is exactly what they  do, the same way a  cult breaks
     its  people down and  rebuilds them as  happy flower sellers  on your local
     street corner. Every one of the six conversion techniques are  used in boot
     camp. Considering the needs of the  military, I'm not making a judgement as
     to whether that is good or bad. IT  IS A FACT that the men are  effectively
     brainwashed. Those  who won't submit  must be discharged  or spend much  of
     their time in the brig.

     Decognition Process

         Once the initial conversion is effected, cults, armed services, and
     similar  groups  cannot have  cynicism  among their  members.  Members must
     respond to commands  and do as they are told,  otherwise they are dangerous
     to   the  organizational  control.  This  is  normally  accomplished  as  a
     three-step Decognition Process.

             Step One is ALERTNESS REDUCTION: The controllers  cause the nervous
     system to  malfunction, making it difficult to  distinguish between fantasy
     and reality.  This can be accomplished  in several ways. POOR  DIET is one;
     watch out for  Brownies and Koolaid.  The sugar  throws the nervous  system
     off. More subtle is the  "SPIRITUAL DIET" used by many cults. They eat only
     vegetables  and fruits; without the grounding of grains, nuts, seeds, dairy
     products, fish or meat, an individual becomes mentally "spacey." INADEQUATE
     SLEEP  is another primary way to reduce alertness, especially when combined
     with long hours of work or intense physical activity. Also, being bombarded
     with intense and unique experiences achieves the same result.

         Step Two is PROGRAMMED CONFUSION: You are mentally assaulted while your
     alertness is  being reduced as  in Step  One. This is  accomplished with  a
     deluge  of  new information,  lectures,  discussion  groups, encounters  or
     one-to-one processing,  which usually amounts to  the controller bombarding
     the  individual with questions.  During this phase  of decognition, reality
     and illusion often merge and perverted logic is likely to be accepted.

             StepThree is THOUGHT STOPPING: Techniques areused to cause the mind
     to  go "flat."  These  are altered-state-of-consciousness  techniques  that
     initially induce calmness by giving the mind something  simple to deal with
     and focusing awareness.  The continued use  brings on a feeling  of elation
     and  eventually hallucination. The result  is the reduction  of thought and
     eventually,  if  used  long  enough,  the  cessation  of  all  thought  and
     withdrawal from everyone  and everything except that which  the controllers
     direct. The takeover  is then complete.  It is important  to be aware  that
     when  members  or participants  are  instructed  to use  "thought-stopping"
     techniques,  they are told  that they will  benefit by so  doing: they will
     become "better soldiers" or "find enlightenment."

             There are threeprimary techniquesused for thoughtstopping. Thefirst
     is MARCHING: the thump, thump, thump beat literally generates self-hypnosis
     and thus great susceptibility to suggestion.


                                                                             520

             Thesecond thought stopping technique is MEDITATION. If you spend an
     hour to an hour and a half a day in meditation, after a few weeks, there is
     a great probability that  you will not  return to full beta  consciousness.
     You will remain in  a fixed state of alpha  for as long as you  continue to
     meditate. I'm not saying this is bad--if you do it yourself. It may be very
     beneficial. But it  is a fact  that you are causing  your mind to  go flat.
     I've  worked  with  meditators  on  an  EEG  machine and  the  results  are
     conclusive: the more  you meditate,  the flatter your  mind becomes  until,
     eventually  and especially  if  used  to  excess  or  in  combination  with
     decognition,  all  thought  ceases.  Some  spiritual  groups  see  this  as
     nirvana--which  is  bullshit.  It  is simply  a  predictable  physiological
     result.  And  if heaven  on earth  is  non-thinking and  non-involvement, I
     really question why we are here.

         The third thought-stopping technique is CHANTING, and often chanting in
     meditation. "Speaking in tongues" could also be included in this category.

             All  three-stopping   techniques  produce  an   altered  state   of
     consciousness.  This  may be very good if YOU  are controlling the process,
     for you also control the input. I personally use at least one self-hypnosis
     programming session every day and I  know how beneficial it is for me.  But
     you need to  know if you  use these techniques to  the degree of  remaining
     continually in alpha that,  although you'll be very mellow, you'll  also be
     more suggestible.

     True Believers & Mass Movements

             Before ending this section on conversion,  I want to talk about the
     people  who  are most  susceptible to  it and  about  Mass Movements.  I am
     convinced that at least a third of the population is what Eric Hoffer calls
     "true believers."  They are joiners and followers . . . people who  want to
     give away their power.  They  look for answers, meaning, and  enlightenment
     outside themselves.

         Hoffer, who wrote THE TRUE BELIEVER, a classic on mass movements, says,
     "true  believers are  not intent  on bolstering  and advancing  a cherished
     self, but are those craving to be rid of unwanted self. They are followers,
     not because of a  desire for self-advancement, but  because it can  satisfy
     their passion for self-renunciation!" Hoffer also says that true  believers
     "are eternally incomplete and eternally insecure"!

             I  know this from my  own experience. In  my years of communicating
     concepts and conducting  trainings, I have run  into them again  and again.
     All I  can do is attempt  to show them that  the only thing to  seek is the
     True Self within.   Their personal answers are to be  found there and there
     alone.   I    communicate   that    the   basics   of    spirituality   are
     self-responsibility  and  self-actualization.      But  most  of  the  true
     believers just  tell me that I'm  not spiritual and go  looking for someone
     who will give them the dogma and structure they desire.

             Never underestimate the potential danger of  these people. They can
     easily be  molded into fanatics who will gladly work and die for their holy
     cause.  It is a  substitute for their  lost faith in  themselves and offers
     them as a substitute for individual hope. The Moral Majority is made  up of
     true believers. All cults are composed  of true believers. You'll find them
     in  politics, churches, businesses, and  social cause groups.  They are the
     fanatics in these organizations.


                                                                             521

             Mass Movements will usually havea charismatic leader. The followers
     want  to convert  others to  their way  of living  or impose  a new  way of
     life--if  necessary, by legislating laws  forcing others to  their view, as
     evidenced by the activities  of the Moral Majority. This  means enforcement
     by guns or punishment, for that is the bottomline in law enforcement.

         A common hatred, enemy, or devil is essential to the success of a mass
     movement. The Born-Again Christians have Satan himself, but that isn't
     enough--they've added the  occult, the  New Age thinkers  and, lately,  all
     those who oppose  their integration of church and politics, as evidenced in
     their political reelection campaigns against those who  oppose their views.
     In revolutions, the devil is usually the ruling power or aristocracy. Some
     human-potential movements are far too clever to ask their graduates to join
     anything, thus labeling  themselves as  a cult--but, if  you look  closely,
     you'll find that their devil is anyone and everyone who  hasn't taken their
     training.

         There are mass movements without devils but they seldom attain major
     status. The True Believers are mentally unbalanced or insecure people, or
     those without hope or friends. People don't look for allies when they love,
     but they do when they hate or become obsessed with a cause. And those who
     desire a new  life and  a new order  feel the old  ways must be  eliminated
     before the new order can be built.

     Persuasion Techniques

         Persuasion isn't technically brainwashing but it is the manipulation of
     the human mind by another individual, without the manipulated party being
     aware what caused his opinion shift. I only have time to very basically
     introduce you to a few of the thousands of techniques in use today, but the
     basis of persuasion is always to access your RIGHT BRAIN. The left half of
     your brain is analytical and rational. The right side is creative and
     imaginative. That is overly simplified but it makes my point.  So, the idea
     is to  distract the  left brain  and keep it  busy. Ideally,  the persuader
     generates an eyes-open altered state of consciousness, causing you to shift
     from beta awareness into alpha; this can be measured on an EEG machine.

         First, let  me give you an example of distracting the left brain.
     Politicians use these powerful techniques all the time; lawyers use many
     variations which, I've been told, they call "tightening the noose."

         Assume for a moment that you are watching a politician give a speech.
     First, he might  generate what is called a "YES  SET." These are statements
     that will cause  listeners to agree; they might even  unknowingly nod their
     heads in agreement.  Next come the  TRUISMS. These  are usually facts  that
     could be  debated but, once  the politician has his  audience agreeing, the
     odds are  in the politician's favor  that the audience won't  stop to think
     for themselves, thus continuing  to agree. Last comes the  SUGGESTION. This
     is what the politician  wants you to do and,  since you have been  agreeing
     all along,  you could be persuaded to accept the suggestion. Now, if you'll
     listen closely to my political speech, you'll find that the first three are
     the "yes set," the next three are truisms and the last is the suggestion.


                                                                             522

             "Ladies and gentlemen: are you angry abouthigh food prices? Are you
     tired of astronomical gas prices? Are you sick of out-of-control inflation?
     Well, you know the Other Party allowed 18 percent inflation  last year; you
     know crime has  increased 50 percent nationwide in the  last 12 months, and
     you know  your paycheck  hardly covers  your expenses  any more. Well,  the
     answer to resolving these problems is to  elect me, John Jones, to the U.S.
     Senate."

         And I think you've heard all that before. But you might also watch for
     what are called Imbedded Commands. As an example: On key words, the speaker
     would make  a gesture with his left hand,  which research has shown is more
     apt to access your right brain. Today's media-oriented politicians and
     spellbinders are often carefully trained by a whole new breed of specialist
     who are using every trick in the book--both old and new--to manipulate you
     into accepting their candidate.

             The  concepts and  techniques of  Neuro-Linguistics are  so heavily
     protected  that I  found out  the hard  way  that to  even talk  about them
     publicly   or  in   print   results  in   threatened   legal  action.   Yet
     Neuro-Linguistic training is readily available to anyone  willing to devote
     the  time and pay  the price. It  is some of  the most subtle  and powerful
     manipulation  I have  yet  been  exposed to.  A  good  friend who  recently
     attended a two-week seminar  on Neuro-Linguistics found that many  of those
     she talked to during the breaks were government people.

             Another  technique that  I'm  just learning  about is  unbelievably
     slippery; it is called an INTERSPERSAL TECHNIQUE and the idea is to say one
     thing with words  but plant a subconscious impression of  something else in
     the minds of the listeners and/or watchers.

         Let me give you an example: Assume you are watching a television
     commentator  make the  following  statement: SENATOR  JOHNSON is  assisting
     local authorities to clear up the stupid mistakes of companies contributing
     to the nuclear waste problems." It sounds like a statement of fact, but, if
     the  speaker emphasizes  the  right word,  and especially  if he  makes the
     proper  hand gestures  on  the  key  words,  you could  be  left  with  the
     subconscious  impression  that Senator  Johnson  is  stupid. That  was  the
     subliminal  goal  of the  statement and  the  speaker cannot  be  called to
     account for anything.

         Persuasion techniques are also frequently used on a much smaller scale
     with just as much effectiveness. The insurance salesman knows his pitch is
     likely to be much more effective  if he can get you to  visualize something
     in your mind.  This is  right-brain communication. For  instance, he  might
     pause in his  conversation, look slowly  around your  living room and  say,
     "Can you just imagine this beautiful home burning to the ground?" Of course
     you can!  It is one of  your unconscious fears  and, when he forces  you to
     visualize it,  you are  more  likely to  be  manipulated into  signing  his
     insurance policy.


                                                                             523

             The Hare Krishnas, operating in every airport,use what I call SHOCK
     AND  CONFUSION  techniques  to  distract  the  left brain  and  communicate
     directly with  the right brain. While  waiting for a plane,  I once watched
     one operate for over an hour. He had a technique of almost jumping in front
     of  someone.  Initially,  his voice  was loud then  dropped as  he made his
     pitch  to take  a book  and contribute  money to  the cause.  Usually, when
     people  are  shocked, they  immediately withdraw.  In  this case  they were
     shocked by the strange appearance, sudden materialization and loud voice of
     the Hare Krishna devotee.   In other words,  the people went into  an alpha
     state for security  because they didn't want to confront the reality before
     them.  In alpha,  they were  highly suggestible  so they  responded to  the
     suggestion of taking  the book; the  moment they took  the book, they  felt
     guilty and  responded to  the second  suggestion:  give  money. We  are all
     conditioned that  if  someone gives  us  something, we  have  to give  them
     something  in return--in  that  case, it  was  money. While  watching  this
     hustler, I was close enough to notice that many of the people he stopped
     exhibited an outward sign of alpha--their eyes were actually dilated.

     Subliminal Programming

             Subliminals  are  hidden suggestions  that  only  your subconscious
     perceives.   They can be  audio, hidden behind music, or visual, airbrushed
     into a picture, flashed on a screen so fast that you don't consciously  see
     them, or cleverly incorporated into a picture or design.

         Most audio subliminal reprogramming tapes offer verbal suggestions
     recorded at a low volume. I question the efficacy of this technique--if
     subliminals are not perceptible, they cannot be effective, and subliminals
     recorded below  the  audible threshold  are therefore  useless. The  oldest
     audio  subliminal technique  uses a voice  that follows  the volume  of the
     music  so  subliminals  are  impossible  to  detect  without  a  parametric
     equalizer. But  this technique is patented and, when I wanted to develop my
     own line of subliminal audio cassettes, negotiations with the patent holder
     proved to be  unsatisfactory. My  attorney obtained copies  of the  patents
     which I  gave to some  talented Hollywood sound  engineers, asking  them to
     create a new technique. They found a way to psycho-acoustically modify  and
     synthesize the suggestions so that they are projected in the same chord and
     frequency  as the music, thus giving  them the effect of  being part of the
     music. But we found that in using this technique, there is no way to reduce
     various frequencies to detect the subliminals. In other words, although the
     suggestions  are being  heard  by the  subconscious  mind, they  cannot  be
     monitored with even the most sophisticated equipment.

             If we were able to come up withthis technique as easily as we did,I
     can  only  imagine  how  sophisticated  the  technology  has  become,  with
     unlimited government or advertising  funding. And I shudder to  think about
     the propaganda  and commercial  manipulation that we  are exposed  to on  a
     daily basis.  There is simply no way  to know what is  behind the music you
     hear.  It may even be possible  to hide a second voice  behind the voice to
     which you are listening.

             Theseries by Wilson Bryan Key, Ph.D., on subliminals in advertising
     and political campaigns well documents the misuse in many areas, especially
     printed advertising in newspapers, magazines, and posters.


                                                                             524

             The big question about subliminals is: dothey work? And I guarantee
     you they do. Not only  from the response of  those who have used my  tapes,
     but  from the results of such programs  as the subliminals behind the music
     in department stores. Supposedly,  the only message is instructions  to not
     steal:  one East  Coast  department  store  chain  reported  a  37  percent
     reduction in thefts in the first nine months of testing.

             A 1984 article in  the technical newsletter, "Brain-Mind Bulletin,"
     states  that  as much  as  99  percent of  our  cognitive  activity may  be
     "non-conscious," according to the director  of the Laboratory for Cognitive
     Psychophysiology  at the University  of Illinois.  The lengthy  report ends
     with  the  statement,  "these  findings  support  the  use  of   subliminal
     approaches  such as taped suggestions  for weight loss  and the therapeutic
     use of hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming."

     Mass Misuse

             I could relatemany stories that support subliminal programming, but
     I'd rather use my time to make you aware of even more subtle uses of such
     programming.  

         I have personally experienced sitting in a Los Angeles auditorium with
     over  ten  thousand  people  who  were  gathered to  listen  to  a  current
     charismatic figure. Twenty minutes after entering  the auditorium, I became
     aware that I was going in and  out of an altered state. Those  accompanying
     me experienced the same thing.  Since it is our business, we were  aware of
     what  was happening, but those around us  were not. By careful observation,
     what  appeared  to be  spontaneous  demonstrations  were, in  fact,  artful
     manipulations.  The only way  I could figure that  the eyes-open trance had
     been induced was that a 6- to 7-cycle-per-second vibration was  being piped
     into the room behind  the air conditioner sound. That  particular vibration
     generates alpha, which would render the audience highly susceptible. Ten to
     25  percent of  the  population is  capable of  a  somnambulistic level  of
     altered states of consciousness;  for these people, the suggestions  of the
     speaker, if non-threatening, could potentially be accepted as "commands."

     Vibrato

         This leads to the mention of VIBRATO. Vibrato is the tremulous effect
     imparted in  some vocal  or instrumental  music,  and the  cycle-per-second
     range
     causes  people to go into an altered  state of consciousness. At one period
     of English history, singers whose voices contained pronounced  vibrato were
     not allowed to perform publicly because  listeners would go into an altered
     state and have fantasies, often sexual in nature.

             People who attend operaor enjoy listeningto singers like MarioLanza
     are familiar with this altered state induced by the performers.

     ELFs

             Now,  let's carry this awareness  a little farther.  There are also
     inaudible ELFs  (extra-low frequency  waves). These are  electromagnetic in
     nature.  One  of the  primary  uses  of ELFs  is  to  communicate with  our
     submarines.  Dr. Andrija  Puharich, a  highly respected  researcher, in  an
     attempt to  warn  U.S. officials  about  Russian use  of  ELFs, set  up  an
     experiment. Volunteers were wired so their brain waves could be measured on
     an EEG. They were sealed in a metal room that could not be penetrated  by a
     normal signal.
         Puharich then beamed ELF waves at the volunteers. ELFs go right through


                                                                             525

     the earth and, of course, right through metal walls. Those inside couldn't
     know if the signal was or was not being sent. And Puharich watched the
     reactions on the  technical equipment: 30 percent of  those inside the room
     were taken over by the ELF signal in six to ten seconds.

             When I  say "taken over," I  mean that their behavior  followed the
     changes anticipated at very  precise frequencies. Waves below 6  cycles per
     second  caused  the subjects  to become  very  emotionally upset,  and even
     disrupted bodily functions.  At 8.2 cycles,  they felt very high  . . .  an
     elevated  feeling, as though they had been in masterful meditation, learned
     over a  period of years. Eleven  to 11.3 cycles induced  waves of depressed
     agitation leading to riotous behavior.

     The Neurophone

             Dr. PatrickFlanagan is a personalfriend of mine. Inthe early 1960s,
     as a teenager, Pat  was listed as one of the top scientists in the world by
     "Life" magazine.  Among  his many  inventions was  a device  he called  the
     Neurophone--an   electronic  instrument   that  can   successfully  program
     suggestions  directly through contact with  the skin. When  he attempted to
     patent the device, the government demanded that he prove it worked. When he
     did, the National Security  Agency confiscated the neurophone. It  took Pat
     two years of legal battle to get his invention back.

             In using thedevice, you don't hear or see a thing; it is applied to
     the  skin,  which Pat  claims is  the source  of  special senses.  The skin
     contains  more sensors  for heat,  touch, pain,  vibration,  and electrical
     fields than any other part of the human anatomy.

         In one of his recent tests, Pat conducted two identical seminars for a
     military  audience--one seminar one night  and one the  next night, because
     the size of the room was not large enough to accommodate all of them at one
     time.   When the  first  group proved  to be  very  cool and  unwilling  to
     respond, Patrick spent  the next day making  a special tape to play  at the
     second  seminar. The tape instructed the  audience to be extremely warm and
     responsive and  for their  hands to become  "tingly." The  tape was  played
     through the neurophone,  which was connected to a wire  he placed along the
     ceiling  of the room. There were  no speakers, so no  sound could be heard,
     yet the message was  successfully transmitted from that wire  directly into
     the brains  of  the audience.  They were  warm and  receptive, their  hands
     tingled and they responded, according to programming, in other ways  that I
     cannot mention here.

         The more we find out about how human beings work through today's highly
     advanced technological research, the more we learn to control human beings.
     And what probably scares me the most is that the medium for takeover is
     already  in place! The  television set in  your living room  and bedroom is
     doing a lot more than just entertaining you.

             Before I continue, let me point out something else about an altered
     state  of consciousness. When  you go into  an altered  state, you transfer
     into right brain,  which results in the internal release  of the body's own
     opiates:   enkephalins and Beta-endorphins, chemically  almost identical to
     opium. In other  words, it feels good .  . . and you want to  come back for
     more.


                                                                             526

             Recent tests byresearcher Herbert Krugman showedthat, while viewers
     were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain activity by a
     ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were in an  altered state
     . . . in trance more often than not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin
     "fix."

         To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of the
     Veterans Hospital in  Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young viewers  to an
     EEG machine that was wired  to shut the TV set off  whenever the children's
     brains produced a  majority of alpha waves. Although the children were told
     to concentrate, only a few could keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!

         Most viewers are already hypnotized. To deepen the trance is easy. One
     simple way is  to place a blank,  black frame every  32 frames in the  film
     that  is  being  projected.  This creates  a  45-beat-per-minute  pulsation
     perceived  only by the subconscious  mind--the ideal pace  to generate deep
     hypnosis.

         The commercials or suggestions presented following this alpha-inducing
     broadcast are much more likely to be accepted by the viewer. The high
     percentage of  the viewing  audience that has  somnambulistic-depth ability
     could  very well  accept  the suggestions  as  commands--as long  as  those
     commands  did not ask  the viewer to  do something contrary  to his morals,
     religion, or self-preservation.

         The medium for takeover is here. By the age of 16, children have spent
     10,000 to 15,000  hours watching  television--that is more  time than  they
     spend n school! In the average home, the  TV set is on for six hours and 44
     minutes per day--an increase of nine minutes from last year and three times
     the average rate of increase during the 1970s.

         It obviously isn't getting better . . . we are rapidly moving into an
     alpha-level world--very possibly the Orwellian world of "1984"--placid,
     glassy-eyed, and responding obediently to instructions.

         A research project by Jacob Jacoby, a Purdue University psychologist,
     found  that  of 2,700  people tested,  90  percent misunderstood  even such
     simple  viewing fare as commercials and "Barnaby Jones." Only minutes after
     watching, the typical viewer missed 23 to 36 percent of the questions about
     what he or she had seen. Of course they did--they were going in and  out of
     trance!  If  you  go  into  a  deep  trance,  you  must  be  instructed  to
     remember--otherwise you automatically forget.

         I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. When you start to combine
     subliminal messages behind the music, subliminal visuals projected on the
     screen, hypnotically produced visual effects, sustained musical beats at a
     trance-inducing pace . . . you have extremely effective brainwashing. Every
     hour  that you spend watching the TV  set you become more conditioned. And,
     in case you  thought there  was a law  against any  of these things,  guess
     again.   There  isn't! There  are a  lot of  powerful people  who obviously
     prefer things exactly the way they are. Maybe they have plans for?

             A NEO-PAGAN FILMOGRAPHY 
                An Annotated List 
             of Recommended Viewing 
             ======================= 
                 (compiled 3/89) 
                 by Mike Nichols 
      
      
               Although this list is a long one, it could easily  have been much
     longer.  In fact, the hard part was deciding which of many good  movies had
     to be left out,  due to limitations  of space.   So I used  a few rules  to
     guide me.   First, I  gave preference  to movies  that had  a strong  Pagan
     message, as opposed to films that  are 'merely' entertaining.  Thus, a film
     like  'Never Cry Wolf',  though it has  no supernatural elements,  made the
     list; whereas superbly crafted atmospheric entertainments like 'Gothic' and
     'Eyes  of  Fire'  didn't.   Second,  in  dealing with  the  supernatural, I
     concentrated on films  that informed, or at least stayed  within the realms
     of  possibility.  Hence, I  include 'The Haunting',  but not 'Poltergeist'.
     Inevitably,  I will  have left  out  some of  your favorites,  for which  I
     apologize in advance.  But I had to stop somewhere. 
      
      
     APPRENTICE TO MURDER, 1988, C-94m 
     D:  R.L. Thomas.    Donald Sutherland,  Chad Lowe,  Mia Sara,  Knut Husebo,
     Rutanya Alsa. 
          Intriguing fact-based story of a man who was a 'hex-meister' in the 
     Pennsylvania Dutch tradition.  His practice of folk medicine lands him in 
     trouble with the law, and a final confrontation with a rival sorcerer leads
     to a  charge of murder.  Sutherland is appealing  in the lead role, and the
     story  unfolds mainly through  his eyes.   Mia  Sara does a  nice job  in a
     supporting role.  There's a lot of authentic folk magic to lend atmosphere.
      
     THE BELIEVERS, 1987, C-114m 
     D:  John Schlesinger.   Martin  Sheen, Helen  Shaver, Harley  Cross, Robert
     Loggia,  Elizabeth Wilson,  Lee  Richardson, Harris  Yulin, Richard  Masur,
     Carla Pinza, Jimmy Smits. 
               Afterthe death ofhis wife, Sheen andhis son moveto New York City,
     where they become involved  in a grisly series of cultish human sacrifices.
     Although  the religion  of Santeria  is unfortunately  shown in  a negative
     light, there is  enough authenticity to lend lots of  interest.  A gripping
     thriller. 
      
     BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE, 1958, C-103m 
     D: Richard Quine.  James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon, Ernie Kovaks, 
     Hermione Gingold. 
               Yes, I'm well aware that this movie, based on the John Van Druten
     play, is responsible for more misinformation about Witchcraft than anything
     outside the  'Bewitched' TV  series.   Still,  I hardly  know  a Pagan  who
     doesn't  love it.  For many  of us, it was the  first time we'd encountered
     the idea  of Witchcraft alive  and well in  a modern  metropolis.  And  Kim
     Novak is STILL my idea of what a Witch OUGHT to look like.   And none of us
     will ever  forget Kovak's reading of the line 'Witches, boy!  Witches!'  Or
     Stewart's offhand comment that it feels more like Halloween than Christmas.
     Lots of fun.

     BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON, 1973-Italian-British, C-121m 
     D: Franco Zeffirelli.  Graham Faulkner, Judi Bowker, Leigh Lawson, Alec 
     Guinness, Valentina Cortese, Kenneth Cranham 
               For most Pagans, St.  Francis of Assisi is usually  considered an
     honorary Pagan, at the very  least.  His insistence on finding  divinity in
     nature is exactly what Paganism is all about.  This film biography portrays
     his extreme  love of and sensitivity  to nature with poignant  beauty.  And
     the musical  score by Donovan is  such a perfect choice  that, having heard
     it, nothing else would ever do.  This is  also a visually stunning film, as
     those who remember Zefferelli's 'Romeo and  Juliet' might expect.  If  ever
     Christianity could be made palatable to the sensibilities of Neo-Pagans, it
     would have  to be through the  eyes of a  nature mystic like Francis.   The
     Catholic Church came close to naming him a heretic but, at the last minute,
     the Pope  (played by Alec  Guinness) sanctioned  him.  (Old  Obi Wan  comes
     through again!) 
      
     BURN, WITCH, BURN!, 1962-British, 90m 
     D:  Sidney Hayers.  Janey Blair, Peter Wyngarde, Margaret Johnston, Anthony
     Nicholls. 
               Based  on the Fritz Leiber classic 'Conjure Wife' and scripted by
     Richard Matheson, this is an interesting view of Witchcraft.  Granted, this
     has as many misconceptions as 'Bell, Book, and Candle', yet the premise is 
     intriguing: that ALL  women are secretly  Witches, and  ALL men don't  know
     about  it.  This is  mainly about one  woman's use of magic  to advance the
     career of her schoolteacher husband. 
      
     DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE, 1959, C-93m 
     D:  Robert  Stevenson.   Albert Sharpe,  Janet  Munro, Sean  Connery, Jimmy
     O'Dea, Kieron Moore, Estelle Winwood. 
          Simply the best fantasy ever filmed.  No kidding.  This is a PERFECT 
     little movie, and (along  with 'The Quiet Man') the  ultimate St. Patrick's
     Day film.  Sharpe is sensational as  Darby O'Gill, who likes to sit in  the
     pub telling stories about his adventures  with the King of the Leprechauns.
     Unbeknownst to everyone, they are TRUE stories!  Every tidbit of Irish 
     folklore, from banshees to the crock of gold  to the costa bower (the death
     coach) is worked into the plot.  The  music and songs are great.  So is the
     cast, many  of whom  were brought  over from the  Abbey Theater  in Dublin!
     Sean  Connery makes his  screen debut, in  a SINGING role!   The subsequent
     untimely death of  Janet Munro robbed  the screen of  one of its  brightest
     actresses.  (Her character's combination of willfulness and femininity is a
     textbook  study.   Compared  to  her,  Princess  Leia's  character  is  not
     'strong-willed' -- it's just  snotty!)  The special effects  are miraculous
     for 1959!  When Darby walks into King Brian's throne room, we walks THROUGH
     a crowd of Leprechauns, and I defy anyone  to find a matte line!  In  fact,
     the special effects  are so good throughout,  that you FORGET that  they're
     special effects,  and end up deciding  that they must have  rounded up some
     real Leprechauns from somewhere.

     THE DARK CRYSTAL, 1983-British, C-94m 
     D: Jim Henson and Frank Oz.  Performed by Jim Henson, Kathryn Mullen, Frank
     Oz, Dave Goelz, Brian Muehl, Jean Pierre Amiel, Kiran Shaw. 
               The creators of the Muppets come up with an entire fantasy world,
     where even the  flora and fauna are  original.  And this world  is in grave
     peril  unless  the missing  shard  of the  Dark  Crystal can  be  found and
     restored  to it.   This  is a   hero-quest  in the  classic mold,  with art
     stylings   by  Brian   Froud.     Although   wonderfully  imaginative   and
     entertaining,  it has  a  very  strong  message  of  mysticism,  all  about
     universal  balance and  the synthesis  of opposites.   (One wonders  if the
     entire quartz crystal fad of the late 1980's had its origins here!) 
      
     DON'T LOOK NOW, 1973-British, C-110m 
     D: Nicolas Roeg.  Julie Christie, Donald Sutherland, Hilary Mason, Clelia 
     Matania, Massimo Serato. 
               Based ona so-so occultthriller by Daphnedu Maurier, thisbecomes a
     brilliant film  in the hands  of Italian  director Nicolas Roeg  (famed for
     'The Man Who  Fell to Earth).   Shortly after  their daughter has  drowned,
     Sutherland (who restores mosaics in old churches) and his wife go to Venice
     where they meet two sisters  who are spiritualists.  They begin  to receive
     messages  from the daughter, who  keeps warning Sutherland  to leave Venice
     because he  is in mortal danger.  If ever  a film captured the real feeling
     of how  psychic  ability operates,  this  is it.    The use  of  subjective
     editing, and the symbolic use (and total control of!)  color throughout the
     film is masterful.  (This film also  contains one of the most stylish  love
     scenes ever  filmed.)  Squeamish people need to be warned about the violent
     ending, however.  

     THE DUNWICH HORROR, 1970, C-90m 
     D: Daniel Haller.  Sandra Dee, Dean Stockwell, Ed Begley, Sam Jaffe, Lloyd 
     Bochner, Joanna Moore, Talia Coppolia (Shire). 
               Nice adaptation of an H. P.Lovecraft story, with a wonderfulcast.
     Dean 
     Stockwell is the quintessential ritual magician, both mysterious and 
     compelling.  He steals the original 'Necronomicon' from a  library in order
     to  'bring back  the Old  Ones', a race  of powerful  but dark  beings that
     inhabited the  earth before humans.   Sam Jaffe is wonderful  as his crazed
     grandfather.   (What happened to the  father is part of  the mystery!)  And
     Sandra Dee is  perfect as the  innocent virgin chosen  to be the  unwilling
     host mother for  the rebirth of these  demons.  (Some versions  of the film
     cut the last scene short, which shows a developing fetus  superimposed over
     Dee's abdomen.  'Nuff  said.)  By the way,  no film has ever shown  the raw
     power of  otherworldly beings as well  as this.  No  'latex lovelies' here.
     Just pure, unadulterated elemental force.  Nice job! 
      
     THE EMERALD FOREST, 1985, C-113m 
     D: John Boorman.  Powers Boothe, Meg Foster, Charley Boorman, Dira Pass. 
               A look atour ownculture through theeyes of theaboriginal tribesof
     the  Amazon.    (They   call  us  the  'termite  people',  because  of  the
     deforestation  and   industrial  development  we  have   brought  to  their
     homeland.)  The director's son,  Charley, is totally convincing as a  young
     boy raised by aborigines.  Great music by Junior Homrich.

     THE ENTITY, 1983, C-115m 
     D: Sidney J. Furie.  Barbara Hershey, Ron Silver,  Jacqueline Brooks, David
     Lablosa, George Coe, Margaret Blye. 
               The trulyfrightening thing about thismovie is that it'sbased on a
     true story, about a woman who is repeatedly violently raped by an invisible
     presence.  Initially, she seeks the help of a psychologist, who is a strict
     behaviorist  and thinks that it  is all 'in  her mind'.  It  is not until a
     chance encounter with a team of parapsychologist  from the local university
     that  she finally  finds people  who understand  her problem.   One  of the
     film's  great strengths is its  portrayal of the  professional rivalry that
     develops  between  the  psychologist  (who  has  begun  taking  a  personal
     interest) and  the parapsychologists,  who are interested  in investigating
     the phenomena.   The final scene in  the gymnasium is the  only part of the
     film based on speculation only.  At last report, the case was still active.
      EXCALIBUR, 1981-British, C-140m 
     D: John Boorman.   Nicol  Williamson, Nigel Terry,  Helen Mirren,  Nicholas
     Clay, Cherie Lunghi, Corin Redgrave, Paul Geoffrey. 
               A stylish adaptationof ThomasMalory's 'Le MorteD'Arthur'. Boorman
     knew  exactly what  he was doing  in combining  certain key  characters and
     keeping the  spirit of the  legends.   The Grail Quest  is especially  well
     handled.    Williamson's Merlin  and  Mirren's Morgana  are  both brilliant
     performances.  Great music.  Try to see this one on the big screen. 
      
     HARVEY, 1950, 104m 
     D: Henry Koster.  James Stewart, Josephine Hull, Peggy Dow, Charles  Drake,
     Cecil Kellaway, Victoria Horne, Jesse White, Wallace Ford, Ida Moore. 
          Imagine a movie that chooses as its main theme a Welsh animal spirit 
     called a pooka (or 'pwcca' in Welsh)!  That would be improbable enough by 
     today's standards.  But the fact that it happened in a 1940's Pulitzer 
     Prize-winning play and subsequent movie boggles the mind!  The pooka in 
     question is a 6-foot  invisible rabbit named Harvey, who  manifests himself
     only to  a gentle tippler  named Elwood  P. Dowd, played  to perfection  by
     Stewart.   Jesse White (the  lonely Maytag  repairman) made his  film debut
     here.  Few movies are as much fun as this. 
      
     THE HAUNTING, 1963, 112m 
     D: Robert Wise.  Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn,
     Lois Maxwell, Fay Compton 
               Based on ShirleyJackson's masterpiece 'TheHaunting of HillHouse',
     this is probably  the ultimate ghost movie.  A  parapsychologist and a team
     of student assistants  investigate a haunted  house.  Based on  the premise
     that no  ghost ever hurts anyone  physically; the damage is  always done by
     the victim to himself, psychologically.  Julie Harris is marvelous. 
      
     INHERIT THE WIND, 1960, 127m 
     D: Stanley Kramer.  Spencer Tracy, Fredric March, Gene Kelly, Florence 
     Eldridge, Dick  York,  Harry Morgan,  Donna Anderson,  Elliot Reid,  Claude
     Akins, Noah Beery, Jr., Norman Fell. 
               This should be required viewing for every Pagan.  For many of us,
     there came  a time  when our  own ideologies  simply collided  head-on with
     fundamental  Christian faith, and  we knew  we could  no longer  accept it.
     Never has a movie embodied this theme so well.  Based on the play by Jerome
     Lawrence and Robert E.  Lee, it deals with the Scopes  Monkey Trial of 1925
     in  Tennessee,  where  a high  school  teacher  was  arrested for  teaching
     Darwin's Theory  of Evolution.  The  debate that ensued was  between two of
     the most brilliant  minds of  their day,  the great  trial lawyer  Clarence
     Darrow  for  the  defense,  and  two-time  Presidential  candidate  William
     Jennings  Bryan for  the  prosecution.    Kelly's  character  is  based  on
     acid-tongued columnist  H. L.  Mencken.   This is riveting,  from first  to
     last.

     JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL, 1973, C-120m 
     D: Hal Bartlett.  Many seagulls. 
          Although the film is flawed and drags a little toward the end, it is 
     nevertheless well worth seeing.  The photography is beautiful, and Neil 
     Diamond's  score (including  'Skybird') is  marvelous.   It is,  of course,
     based on Richard Bach's marvelous tale  of a little seagull that refuses to
     fit  in  with his  flock,  preferring to  follow  a higher,  more mystical,
     calling.  This is yet another one you should try to see on the big screen. 
      
     LADYHAWKE, 1985, C-124m 
     D: Richard Donner.  Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leo
     McKern, John Wood, Ken Hutchison, Alfred Molina. 
               Whoever decidedon themusic for thisfilm should beshot! Think what
     a nice soundtrack by Clannad would have been like.  That reservation aside,
     this  is  a great  medieval fantasy  concerning  two lovers  who  have been
     separated by a curse, and a young thief who  becomes their ally, an unusual
     but charming  role for Matthew Broderick.   (If anyone ever  gets around to
     filming Katherine Kurtz's 'Deryni' books, this is the team that ought to do
     it.) 
      
     THE LAST UNICORN, 1982, C-84m 
     D: Rankin & Bass.  Voices of Mia Farrow, Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, Tammy 
     Grimes, Robert Klein, Angela Lansbury, Christopher Lee. 
               Based on theincomparable fantasy novel by PeterS. Beagle, this is
     very adult animation.   And  because Beagle himself  wrote the  screenplay,
     this film  contains spiritual  one-liners that  hit you  right in the  gut.
     Example:  'Never run from anything immortal.  It attracts their attention.'
     Though this is NOT classic Disney animation (in fact, it looks like limited
     animation), the voice-work, screenplay,  and art stylings are all  so good,
     you're  inclined to  overlook it.   Angela  Lansbury's character  voice for
     Mommy Fortuna  is marvelous.   And there's  a lovely lyrical  score by  the
     group America. 
      
     THE LAST WAVE, 1977-Australian, C-106m 
     D: Peter Weir.  Richard Chamberlain, Olivia Hamnett, (David) Gulpilil, 
     Frederick Parslow, Vivean Gray, Nanjiwarra Amagula. 
               Chamberlainplays anAustralian lawyerdefending anaborigine accused
     of a murder that was actually done by magic.  This is a rare and wonderful 
     glimpse  into the tribal religion  of the native  Australians, their myths,
     and their  belief in  the Dream Time.   Peter  Weir (famed  for 'Picnic  at
     Hanging Rock') directs this atmospheric thriller. 
      
     LEGEND, 1985-British, C-89m 
     D: Ridley Scott.  Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry, David Bennent, Alice 
     Playten, Billy Barty. 
               Oneof the mostvisually luscious filmsever created. Every frame is
     gorgeous.  The plot is nearly archetypal, with evil (Curry) attempting to 
     seduce innocence (Sara).  Though it's hard to accept Cruise as the hero  of
     this Grimm's-like fairy  tale, Curry  and Sara turn  in good  performances.
     The European version runs 20 minutes longer and  retains the original (and,
     in my opinion,  superior) musical score  by Jerry Goldsmith.   The American
     score is by Tangerine Dream. 
      


                                                                             532

     THE LORD OF THE RINGS, 1978, C-133m 
     D: Ralph Bakshi.  Voices of Christopher Guard, William Squire, John Hurt, 
     Michael Sholes, Dominic Guard. 
          This ambitious but flawed animated feature covers half of J.R.R. 
     Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, ending much too abruptly.  But for all the 
     criticism  usually heaped  upon this  film, there  ARE moments  of absolute
     genius.   Such as the Dark Riders  attempting to kill Frodo  and friends in
     their beds at the Prancing Pony  Inn.  Or Gandalf and Frodo's moonlit  walk
     through  the Shire.   Or  the first  time Frodo  puts on  the ring.   These
     moments alone make the movie well worth seeing. 
      
     NEVER CRY WOLF, 1983, C-105m 
     D:  Carroll   Ballard.    Charles  Martin  Smith,  Brian  Dennehy,  Zachary
     Ittimangnaq, Samson Jorah. 
          A brilliant performance by Smith (based on author Farley Mowat) as a 
     young man sent to study wolves in the Arctic.  Again, we are treated to the
     insights of the native culture (the Innuit), and are  shown how it has been
     debased  through contact with  our own greedy culture.   This film contains
     some of the most spectacular nature  photography ever put on film.  Ballard
     was  chief nature photographer  for Disney Studios  for years.   Try to see
     this one on the big screen. 
      
     NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE, 1979-West German, C-107m 
     D: Werner Herzog.  Klaus Kinski, Isabelle Adjani, Bruno Ganz, Roland Topor.
             Forvampire lovers, this film isthe creme de lacreme.  Werner Herzog
     is a leader of modern German Expressionist cinema, and here he is operating
     at the top of his  form.  The spooky atmosphere is so thick  you could peel
     it off the  screen in layers.  (Try  to see this one in the  theater.)  The
     creepiness  of Kinski's Dracula  is equaled only  by the  classic beauty of
     Adjani's Lucy.  This is the  perfect film for Halloween night.   The German
     language  version with  English subtitles  is far  superior to  the English
     version, and slightly longer.  (The  SOUND of the German dialogue  actually
     fits the mood of the film better.) 
      
     ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER, 1970, C-129m 
     D: Vincente Minnelli.  Barbra Streisand, Yves Montand, Bob Newhart, Larry 
     Blyden, Simon Oakland, Jack Nicholson.  Alan Lerner & Burton Lane score. 
               Probablyinspired by the case of BrideyMurphy, this musical is all
     about hypnosis, past  life regression, ESP,  reincarnation, and other  'New
     Age' topics (though 20 years too early).  (One wonders how Shirley MacLaine
     missed  starring  in  this.    Yet,  one  is  thankful  for small  favors.)
     Streisand  is  wonderful, especially  in  the  lavish flashback  sequences.
     Montand should have  been replaced.  Still, the plot's surprising turns are
     well within the realm of supernatural possibility.

     THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW, 1988, C-98m 
     D: Wes  Craven.  Bill  Pullman, Cathy  Tyson, Zakes  Mokae, Paul  Winfield,
     Brent Jennings, Theresa Merritt, Michael Gough. 
               Directed by Wes Craven  (famed for his 'Nightmare on  Elm Street'
     series), this is the true story of Wade Davis, an ethnobotanist who is sent
     to  Haiti  to  bring  back  the   secret  of  the  so-called  Zombie  drug,
     tetrodotoxin.   But the local  practitioners of 'Voodoo'  don't yield their
     secrets too  easily and, before it's all over, Davis finds himself a victim
     of  the drug -- which gives Craven  carte blanche for the wonderful special
     effects he's famous  for.   Like 'The Believers',  this film  unfortunately
     shows the native religion (Voudoun) primarily  in a negative light.  Still,
     at  times  it  manages  to  capture  its  beauty,  mystery  and  innocence,
     especially in the festival scenes when the entire village  spends the night
     asleep in a candle-lighted forest. 
      
     7 FACES OF DR. LAO, 1964, C-100m 
     D: George Pal.  Tony Randall, Barbara Eden, Arthur O'Connell, John Ericson,
     Kevin  Tate,  Argentina Brunetti,  Noah  Beery, Jr.,  Minerva  Urecal, John
     Qualen, Lee Patrick, Royal Dano. 
               For  people  who think  that decent  fantasy  films are  a recent
     development, this movie  is going to  come as a  delightful surprise.   The
     special effects  and gentle magic  of director  George Pal was  the perfect
     means of bringing the Charles Finney classic 'The Circus of Dr. Lao' to the
     screen.   Randall, in  a tour  de force  performance of  six roles, is  the
     mysterious  Chinese guru,  Dr.  Lao, whose  travelling  circus changes  the
     course of history for  a small Western town.  For the better.  A lovely and
     funny film with  a spiritual  dimension that would  appeal to every  Pagan.
     Nice musical score by Leigh Harline combines Western and Oriental music. 
      
     SILENT RUNNING, 1971, C-89m 
     D: Douglas Trumbull.  Bruce Dern, Cliff Potts, Ron Rifkin, Jesse Vint. 
               Should be subtitled 'Druidsin Spaaaaace!!!'  Aboard thedeep space
     ship  Valley Forge, the very talented Bruce  Dern (in his most likable film
     role  ever)  battles to  save  the last  vestiges of  the  Earth's forests.
     Special effects by the team  that created '2001'.  And a  brilliant musical
     score by Peter Schickele (whose better-known comic persona is P.D.Q. Bach),
     sung by Joan Baez. 
      
     SLEEPING BEAUTY, 1959, C-75m 
     D:  Clyde Geronimi.   Voices of  Mary Costa,  Bill Shirley,  Elinor Audley,
     Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen, Barbara Luddy. 
               The  all-time masterpiece of the animator's art, this is the most
     lavish and most expensive (by contemporary standards) animated feature ever
     done by Disney  studios.  The uninitiated may babble  about 'Fantasia', but
     the true cognoscente of  animation know that THIS is the  apogee of the art
     form.   From the lush color stylings (heavy  use of greens and purples), to
     the elegantly stylized backgrounds, to  the figure of Maleficent  (designed
     by  Marc Davis),  to  a fire-breathing  dragon  that wasn't  equaled  until
     'Dragonslayer', this  film is superb.   Voice work by Audley  and Felton is
     outstanding.   The film should  also serve as a  textbook example of how to
     adapt a classical score (Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty Ballet') to a movie
     soundtrack.    Never  has  it  been  done  better.    See  it.    One  last
     consideration: this was filmed in the extra-wide-screen Technerama process,
     and naturally loses a lot when transferred to video.   Try to see this in a
     theater.   One with a BIG screen  and a state-of-the-art sound system.  You
     will be amazed.

     SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, 1983, C-94m 
     D: Jack  Clayton.  Jason  Robards, Jonathan Pryce,  Diane Ladd,  Pam Grier,
     Royal Dano, Shawn Carson, Vidal Peterson, Mary Grace Canfield, James Stacy,
     narrated by Arthur Hill. 
               RayBradbury's fantasy novel is brought tothe screen by a director
     who understands it.  This is a mood piece, and it's done to perfection.  It
     all  takes  place  in  that  strange  twilight  halfway between  children's
     make-believe and the  world of the  supernatural.  You're never  quite sure
     which it is.   Jonathan Pryce  is utterly mesmerizing  as the sinister  Mr.
     Dark, leader  of a mysterious travelling  carnival.  He has  so much screen
     presence you can barely take your eyes off him.  I haven't seen an actor in
     such total control of a role since Gene Wilder did 'Willy Wonka'.  An added
     bonus is  that Bradbury himself wrote the screenplay, and it shows.  It's a
     real cut above the insipid screenplays we're all used to. 
      
     STAR WARS, 1977, C-121m 
     D: George Lucas.  Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing,
     Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, voice of  James Earl Jones (as
     Darth Vader) 
               Despite the spaceships and high-tech doodads, this is really more
     fantasy than science fiction.  And the reliance which director George Lucas
     placed in the theories of  Joseph Campbell help shape a story  that is very
     near to  myth.  The  other two movies  in the trilogy,  'The Empire Strikes
     Back'  and 'Return of the  Jedi' are also important.   The main interest to
     most Pagans lies in the mystical sub-motif of 'the Force',  a kind a 'mana'
     that is ethically neutral,  but may be  used in magic  for either good  (as
     evidenced by Obi Wan Kenobe) or evil (as evidenced by Darth Vader).  In the
     second film, it is the great  Jedi Master, Yoda (created by Muppet masters,
     Jim Henson and Frank  Oz), who teaches  us most about the  Force.  This  is
     pure magic. 
      
     THE WATCHER IN THE WOODS, 1980, C-84 
     D: John Hough.  Bette Davis, Carroll Baker, David McCallum, Lynn-Holly 
     Johnson, Kyle Richards, Ian Bannen, Richard Pasco. 
               What I wouldn't giveto have seen thisas a teenager! Johnson stars
     as a girl whose family has just rented an old English country house,  where
     she is  haunted by the  image of a  young girl  who disappeared years  ago.
     During  a strange seance-type  initiation ritual.   In the ruins  of an old
     chapel.  During a freak  lightning storm.  During an eclipse.   The subtext
     is so  thick you  could cut  it with a  knife.   Even though  such elements
     remain unstated, for those of us interested in power points, ley lines, and
     astronomical  alignments, this  movie  is  a  real  treat.    Someone  Knew
     Something!  Sadly, the end is badly flawed.  But no matter, because the fun
     is  in  the  getting  there.   A  delightful  cast,  and  great  atmosphere
     throughout, make this film special. 
      
     THE WICKER MAN, 1973-British, C-95m 
     D: Robin Hardy.  Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland, Diane 
     Cilento, Ingrid Pitt, Lindsay Kemp. 
               Based on the Anthony Shaffer thriller,this movie is a favorite of
     most Pagans.    The plot  concerns  a police  sergeant (Woodward)  sent  to
     investigate the  disappearance of a young  girl, on a small  island off the
     coast of Scotland.  There he finds a completely Pagan society.  Local color
     and beautiful  folk music  enhance the  most loving  portrayal  of a  Pagan
     society ever committed to film.   Unfortunately, in the end, the Pagans are
     'revealed' to be the requisite bad  guys.  If you can overlook  the ending,
     however, this is fine  movie.  Every  Pagan I know who's  seen it wants  to
     move to Summer Isle immediately. 
     WILLOW, 1988, C-125m 
     D: Ron Howard.  Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Warwick Davis, Jean Marsh, 


                                                                             535

     Patricia Hayes, Billy Barty, Pat Roach, Gavan O'Herlihy. 
               Despitethe story byGeorge Lucas, thisis NOT the'Star Wars' of the
     fantasy genre.  Too derivative (especially Mad Martigan, who is  a Han Solo
     clone).  Still, the film has a lot to say about magic, and Davis gives a 
     delightful performance.  Jean  Marsh is terrific as the evil Queen Bavmorda
     (in a  role that  almost parallels her  role as Queen  Mombi in  'Return to
     Oz').   And the scene in which Chirlindrea  appears to Willow in the forest
     is as close to an epiphany of the  Goddess as I've ever seen on film.  That
     scene alone is worth the admission price. 
      
     WINDWALKER, 1980, C-108m 
     D: Keith Merrill.   Trevor Howard, Nick  Ramus, James Remar, Serene  Hedin,
     Dusty Iron Wing McCrea. 
               This  is the best cowboy-and-Indian movie I've ever seen.  Mainly
     because  there are no cowboys  in it.  It is  pure Native American.  Trevor
     Howard  is incredible as the old Indian  chief who returns from the dead in
     order to protect his family, and restore to  it a lost son, a twin who  was
     stolen at  birth by  an enemy  tribe.  This  film FEELS  more like  genuine
     Native American than any  other I can think of.   The Utah mountain scenery
     is breath-taking.  Costuming  (mostly furs) is authentic.   And dialogue is
     actually in the Cheyenne and Crow  languages, with English subtitles.   And
     there's enough  mysticism (especially in the old Indian's relationship with
     his horse) to please any Pagan audience. 
      
     WIZARDS, 1977, C-80m 
     D: Ralph Bakshi.  Voices of Bob Holt, Jesse Wells, Richard Romanus, David 
     Proval, Mark Hamill. 
               Post-holocaust scenario withthe forcesof evil technologyled bythe
     wizard Blackwolf arrayed against the forces of benevolent  magic led by the
     wizard Avatar.   With background stylings  a la Roger  Dean, and  character
     design that borrows from  Vaughn Bode, this is tongue-in-cheek  wizardry at
     its finest.  The character of Elinor,  a faery nymph, is a complete success
     -- a milestone in  adult animation.  Great voice work and  nice music.  And
     who is that wonderful (uncredited) narrator??? 
      
     XANADU, 1980, C-88m 
     D: Robert Greenwald.  Olivia Newton-John, Michael Beck, Gene Kelly, James 
     Sloyan, Dimitra Arliss, Katie Hanley. 
          Yeah, yeah, I know.  On one level, it's just Olivia Newton-John on 
     roller-skates.   But on another level,  it is the  story of how one  of the
     nine  muses of classical mythology (Terpsichore) comes down from Olympus to
     inspire  a young artist.  On yet a third level, it is the biggest Hollywood
     musical produced  since the golden years of MGM.   And it works well on all
     counts.  The  brilliant musical score (including several  chart-toppers) is
     provided by the Electric Light Orchestra's Jeff Lynne, and Olivia does them
     up proper.  Gene  Kelly might not dance as well as he  once did, but he can
     still charm  as well.  And did anyone notice that's Sandahl Bergman leading
     the  muses  in dance?   As  if  that weren't  enough,  the film  includes a
     delightful  animated segment that marked  the debut for  Don Bluth studios,
     which later gave us 'The Secret of NIHM' and 'An American Tail'.

          It seems quite impossible that the holiday of Candlemas 
     should be considered the beginning of Spring. Here in the 
     heartland, February 2nd may see a blanket of snow mantling the 
     Mother.  Or, if the snows have gone, you may be sure the days are 
     filled with drizzle, slush, and steel-grey skies -- the dreariest 
     weather of the year.  In short, the perfect time for a Pagan 
     Festival of Lights. And as for Spring, although this may seem a 
     tenuous beginning, all the little buds, flowers and leaves will 
     have arrived on schedule before Spring runs its course to Beltane.

         "Candlemas" is the Christianized name for the holiday, of 
     course.  The older Pagan names were Imbolc and Oimelc.  "Imbolc" 
     means, literally, "in the belly" (of the Mother).  For in the 
     womb of Mother Earth, hidden from our mundane sight but sensed by 
     a keener vision, there are stirrings. The seed that was planted 
     in her womb at the solstice is quickening and the new year grows.
      "Oimelc" means "milk of ewes", for it is also lambing season.

         The holiday is also called "Brigit's Day", in honor of the 
     great Irish Goddess Brigit.  At her shrine, the ancient Irish 
     capital of Kildare, a group of 19 priestesses (no men allowed) 
     kept a perpetual flame burning in her honor.  She was considered 
     a goddess of fire, patroness of smithcraft, poetry and healing 
     (especially the healing touch of midwifery).  This tripartite 
     symbolism was occasionally expressed by saying that Brigit had 
     two sisters, also named Brigit.  (Incidentally, another form of 
     the name Brigit is Bride, and it is thus She bestows her special 
     patronage on any woman about to be married or handfasted, the 
     woman being called "bride" in her honor.)

         The Roman Catholic Church could not very easily call the 
     Great Goddess of Ireland a demon, so they canonized her instead.  
     Henceforth, she would be "Saint" Brigit, patron saint of 
     smithcraft, poetry, and healing.  They "explained" this by 
     telling the Irish peasants that Brigit was "really" an early 
     Christian missionary sent to the Emerald Isle, and that the 
     miracles she performed there "misled" the common people into 
     believing that she was a goddess.  For some reason, the Irish 
     swallowed this.  (There is no limit to what the Irish imagination 
     can convince itself of.  For example, they also came to believe 
     that Brigit was the "foster-mother" of Jesus, giving no thought 
     to the implausibility of Jesus having spent his boyhood in Ireland!)

         Brigit's holiday was chiefly marked by the kindling of sacred 
     fires, since she symbolized the fire of birth and healing, the 
     fire of the forge, and the fire of poetic inspiration.  Bonfires 
     were lighted on the beacon tors, and chandlers celebrated their 
     special holiday.  The Roman Church was quick to confiscate this 
     symbolism as well, using "Candlemas" as the day to bless all the 
     church candles that would be used for the coming liturgical year.
     (Catholics will be reminded that the following day, St. Blaise's 
     Day, is remembered for using the newly-blessed candles to bless 
     the throats of parishioners, keeping them from colds, flu, sore 
     throats, etc.)
         The Catholic Church, never one to refrain from piling holiday 
     upon holiday, also called it the Feast of the Purification of the 


                                                                             537

     Blessed Virgin Mary.  (It is surprising how many of the old Pagan 
     holidays were converted to Maryan Feasts.)  The symbol of the 
     Purification may seem a little obscure to modern readers, but it 
     has to do with the old custom of "churching women".  It was 
     believed that women were impure for six weeks after giving birth.  
     And since Mary gave birth at the winter solstice, she wouldn't be 
     purified until February 2nd.  In Pagan symbolism, this might be 
     re-translated as when the Great Mother once again becomes the 
     Young Maiden Goddess.

         Today, this holiday is chiefly connected to weather lore.  
     Even our American folk-calendar keeps the tradition of 
     "Groundhog's Day", a day to predict the coming weather, telling 
     us that if the Groundhog sees his shadow, there will be "six more 
     weeks" of bad weather (i.e., until the next old holiday, Lady 
     Day).  This custom is ancient.  An old British rhyme tells us 
     that "If Candlemas Day be bright and clear, there'll be two 
     winters in the year."  Actually, all of the cross-quarter days 
     can be used as "inverse" weather predictors, whereas the quarter-
     days are used as "direct" weather predictors.

         Like the other High Holidays or Great Sabbats of the Witches' 
     year, Candlemas is sometimes celebrated on it's alternate date, 
     astrologically determined by the sun's reaching 15-degrees 
     Aquarius, or Candlemas Old Style (this year, February 6th). 
     Another holiday that gets mixed up in this is Valentine's Day.  
     Ozark folklorist Vance Randolf makes this quite clear by noting 
     that the old-timers used to celebrate Groundhog's Day on February 
     14th.  Once again, this shows the resultant confusion of calendar 
     changes and "lost days" that have accumulated down the centuries.  
     For modern Witches, Candlemas O.S. may be seen as the Pagan 
     version of Valentine's Day, with a de-emphasis of "hearts and 
     flowers" and an appropriate re-emphasis of Pagan carnal 
     frivolity.  This also re-aligns the holiday with the ancient 
     Roman Lupercalia, a fertility festival held at this time, in 
     which the priests of Pan ran through the streets of Rome whacking 
     young women with goatskin thongs to make them fertile.  The women 
     seemed to enjoy the attention and often stripped in order to 
     afford better targets.

         One of the nicest folk-customs still practiced in many 
     countries, and especially by Witches in the British Isles and 
     parts of the U.S., is to place a lighted candle in each and every 
     window of the house, beginning at sundown on Candlemas Eve 
     (February 1), allowing them to continue burning until sunrise.  
     Make sure that such candles are well seated against tipping and 
     guarded from nearby curtains, etc. What a cheery sight it is on 
     this cold, bleak and dreary night to see house after house with 
     candle-lit windows! And, of course, if you are your Coven's 
     chandler, or if you just happen to like making candles, Candlemas 
     Day is the day for doing it.  Some Covens hold candle-making 
     parties and try to make and bless all the candles they'll be 
     using for the whole year on this day.

         Other customs of the holiday include weaving "Brigit's 
     crosses" from straw or wheat to hang around the house for 
     protection, performing rites of spiritual cleansing and 
     purification, making "Brigit's beds" to ensure fertility of mind 
     and spirit (and body, if desired), and making Crowns of Light 
     (i.e. of candles) for the High Priestess to wear for the 
     Candlemas Circle, similar to those worn on St. Lucy's Day in 
     Scandinavian countries. All and all, this is certainly one of the 
     prettiest holidays celebrated in the Pagan seasonal calendar.

     OPENING THE CIRCLE 
      
      
      
     The High Priestess goes to each of the four directions in turn,  
     and draws a Banishing Pentacle, saying, 
      
      
          Guardians of the East (South, West, North), Powers of Air  
     (Fire, Water, Earth), we thank you 
          For joining in our circle 
          And we ask for your blessing 
          As you depart 
          May there be peace between us 
          Now and forever.  Blessed be. 
      
      
     She raises her athame to the sky and touches it to the earth, then 
     opens her arms and says, 
      
          The circle is open, but unbroken, 
          May the peace of the Goddess 
          Go in your hearts, 
          Merry meet, and merry part. 
          And merry meet again.  Blessed be.

                           Ritual of Casting Sacred Circle
     Many times  we are asked "how  do you cast a  circle ?"  There  are so many
     different was that this  can be done.   Differs from each Tradition to  the
     next.  Even within our own Avaloian Tradition we make improvisions on this.

     The main factor  is to cast  a sacred space.   A space that  separates this
     world from the other.   A space that we  ourselves make holy.  And  that is
     what  is important.  A  space that you set aside  from all else, to glorify
     and exalt.  For you are the one casting, cleansing,  purifying, and setting
     it aside from all else.

     Before  you cast,  one  should make  sure of  the intent  of casting.   Ask
     yourself why  you are doing it.   Once you have this  the gathering is made
     easier.  If you are doing this with a group of people One must be chosen to
     be the Lord  or Lady.  The  Lord or Lady usually  has one person who  waits
     them.   This is not to  say the Lord or  Lady is higher than  they, but the
     fact  that they shall  be the  God/dess incarnate.   You  may also  do this
     solitary.  Depending on the amount tending.

     The Lord/Lady has the sword brought to them.  All else are standing outside
     where the circle  is to be cast.   The Lord/Lady  takes the sword and  walk
     deosil (clockwise) around the space  to be cast.  The wait has a small bell
     with them.   Beginning at the East, the sword, in a non-threatening manner,
     is raised.   The  wait rings  the  bell.   All fill  fall silent.    Moving
     clockwise the Lord/Lady  salute each direction.  If  there are four novices
     present each will stand to the directions as the Lord/Lady passes.

     Lord/Lady:  Let all those that wish to partake enter ye now !  (the bell is
     rung)

     Everyone enters by stepping forward (no actual circle has been cast yet)

     Wait:   My Lord/Lady all those that  wish to partake in  this Magickal Rite
     are now present.  I pray you, cast the Sacred Circle.

     Lord/Lady:  What  thou doth sees  makes here this  night, shall be  forever
     within this circle.  So Mote It Be !

     (When anyone speaks the So Mote It Be or Blessed Be, all shall repeat it)

     Again  at the  East, the  Lord/Lady takes  the sword  and draws  within the
     ground or upon the floor the circle saying as the pass...

      "I draw this magick circle let no evil or ill will cross its mark." 

     Once the  Lord/Lady has  reached the  East again, They  take the  sword and
     place it upon the shoulders of the novice, and says...
          "be thou the  guardian of this  gate... I call I  summon I stir  oh ye
     spirits of Air,  come forth now I pray thee and  witness our Rite.  So Mote
     It Be !"

     The Guardian answers:  I am he/she the guardian, no evil or ill  will shall
     pass by  me, My Lord/Lady.

     the Wait rings the bell 

     The Lord/Lady goes to each quarter and perform the same,  on each guardian.
     The Wait will ring the bell as each guardian answers.
     Once the quarters are called the Lord/Lady goes to the center of the circle
     as  the Wait  preforms the  cleansing of  the circle  with salt  and water.


                                                                             541

     Incense  can  be used  instead  of salt  and water  mixture.  The Lord/Lady
     summons the spirit of the Great Lady and the Great Lord by saying....

     Great Lady witness  now your children who stand before  you in Perfect Love
     and Perfect Trust.  

     Standing East, with the censer  the Lord/Lady says....
        Great Maiden Come To Us.....

     All repeat....

     Standing South, with the torch or candle the Lord/Lady says....
        Great Mother Come To Us....

     All repeat...

     Standing West, with chalice of wine or water, the Lord/Lady says...
        Ancient Queen of Wisdom Come To Us....

     All repeat...

     Standing North, with the salt, the Lord/Lady says....
        Brother Come To Us...

     All Repeat...

     Drumming,  rattles, any form of music making can  be added to this.  As you
     can take note there really isn't any particular God or Goddess called, this
     is the  Avaloian Tradition.  All  Gods are one  God, all Goddesses  are one
     Goddess.

     So there is the very  basic beginnings of Magical Workings... you  can take
     it from here..... Do What Thou Wilt, Save Harm None, Shall Be the Whole.

     Bright Blessing...

                                 LOOKING AT YOURSELF 

     before you go a step further,  take a  good  long  look  at  your 
     desires,  motivation  and  skills.  What role do you see yourself 
     playing  in  this  new  group?   "Ordinary"  member?   Democratic 
     facilitator?  High Priestess?  And if the last -- why do you want 
     the job?  

     The   title  of  High  Priestess  and  Priestess  are  seductive, 
     conjuring up exotic images of yourself in  embroidered  robes,  a 
     silver crescent (or horned helm) on your brow, adoring celebrants 
     hanging on every word which drops from your lips...  

     Reality  check.  The  robes  will be stained with wine and candle 
     wax  soon  enough,   and  not  every  word  you  speak  is  worth 
     remembering.  A  coven  leader's  job is mostly hard work between 
     rituals and behind the scene.  It is not always a good  place  to 
     act  out  your  fantasies,  because  the  lives and well-being of 
     others are involved,  and what is flattering or enjoyable to  you 
     man not be in their best interest.  So consider carefully.  

     If  your  prime  motive is establishing a coven is to gain status 
     and ego gratification,  other people will quickly sense that.  If 
     they are intelligent,  independent individuals,  they will refuse 
     to play Adoring Disciple to your Witch  Queen  impressions.  They 
     will  disappear,  and  that vanishing act will be the last magick 
     they do with you.  

     And if you do attract a  group  ready  to  be  subservient  Spear 
     Carriers  in  your  fantasy drama -- well,  do you really want to 
     associate with that kind of personality?  What are you  going  to 
     do  when you want someone strong around to help you or teach you, 
     and  next  New  Moon  you  look  out  upon  a  handful  of  Henry 
     Milquetoasts  and  Frieda Handmaidens?  If a person is willing to 
     serve you, the they will also become dependent on you, drain your 
     energy,  and become  disillusioned  if  you  ever  let  down  the 
     Infallible Witch Queen mask for even a moment.  

     Some other not-so-great reasons for starting a coven:  a) because 
     it seems glamorous,  exotic,  and a little wicked;  b) because it 
     will shock your mother, or c) because you can endure your boring, 
     flunky  job  more easily if you get to go home and play Witch at 
     night.  

     Some better reasons for setting up a coven,  and even  nomination 
     yourself as High Priest/ess,  include:  a) you feel that you will 
     be performing a useful job for yourself and others;  b) you  have 
     enjoyed  leadership  roles  in  the  past,  and  proven  yourself 
     capable;  or c) you look forward to learning and growing  in  the 
     role.  

     Even  with the best motives in the world,  you will still need to 
     have -- or quickly develop -- a whole range of skills in order to 
     handle a leadership role.  If you are to be a facillitator  of  a 
     study  group,  group  process  insights and skills are important.  
     These include: 


                                                                             543

          1) Gatekeeping,  or  guiding  discussion  in such a way that 
             everyone  has  an  opportunity  to  express   ideas   and 
             opinions; 

          2) Summarizing and clarifying;

          3) Conflict resolution,  or helping  participants understand 
             points of disagreement and find potential solutions which 
             respect everyone's interests; 

          4) Moving the discussion toward consensus,  or at  any  rate 
             decision,   by  identifying  diversions  and  refocussing 
             attention on goals and priorities; and 

          5) Achieving closure smoothly when  the  essential  work  is 
             complected, or an appropriate stopping place is reached.  

     In addition to group  process  skills,  four  other  competencies 
     necessary  to the functioning of a coven are:  ritual leadership, 
     administration,  teaching,  and counseling.  In a study group the 
     last  one  may  not  be considered a necessary function,  and the 
     other three may be shared among all participants.  But in a coven 
     the leaders are expected to be fairly capable in all these areas, 
     even if responsibilities are frequently shared or delegated.  Let 
     us look briefly at each.  

     Ritual  leadership involves much more that reading invocations by 
     candlelight.  Leaders must understand the powers they  intend  to 
     manipulate:  how  they are raised,  channeled and grounded.  They 
     must be adept at designing rituals which involve all the  sensory 
     modes.  They should have a repertoire of songs and chants, dances 
     and gestures or mudras, incense and oils, invocations and spells, 
     visual  effects  and symbols,  meditations and postures;  and the 
     skill to combine these in a powerful, focused pattern.  They must 
     have  clarity  of  purpose  and  firm  ethics.   And  they   must 
     understand  timing:  both where a given ritual fits in the cycles 
     of the Moon, the Wheel of the Year, and the dance of the spheres, 
     and how to pace the ritual once started, so that energy peaks and 
     is channeled at the perfect moment.  And they must understand the 
     Laws of Magick,  and the  correspondences,  and  when  ritual  is 
     appropriate and when it is not.  

     By  administration,   we  refer  to  basic  management  practices 
     necessary to any organization.  These include  apportioning  work 
     fairly, and following up on its progress;  locating resources and 
     obtaining  them   (information,   money,   supplies);   fostering 
     communications  (by  telephone,  printed  schedules,  newsletters 
     etc.);   and  keeping  records  (minutes,  accounts,  Witch  Book 
     entries,  or ritual logbook).  Someone or several someone's has to 
     collect the dues if any, buy the candles, chill the wine,  and so 
     forth.  


                                                                             544

     Teaching is crucial to both covens and study groups.  If only one 
     person has any formal training  or  experience  in  magick,  s/he 
     should  transmit  that  knowledge  in  a  way  which respects the 
     intuitions,  re-emerging past life skills,  and creativity of the 
     others.  If several participants have some knowledge in differing 
     areas,  they  can  all share the teaching role.  If no one in the 
     group has training and you are uncertain where to begin, they you 
     may need to call  on  outside  resources:  informed  and  ethical 
     priest/esses who can act as visiting faculty, or who are willing 
     to  offer  guidance  by  telephone or correspondence.  Much can be 
     gleaned from books,  or course -- assuming you know  which  books 
     are  trustworthy  and at the appropriate level -- but there is no 
     substitute for personal instruction for some things.  Magick  can 
     be  harmful if misused,  and an experienced practitioner can help 
     you avoid pitfalls as well as offering hints and  techniques  not 
     found in the literature.  

     Counseling  is  a  special  role  of  the High Priest/ess.  It is 
     assumed that all members  of  a  coven  share  concern  for  each 
     other's physical,  mental,  emotional and spiritual welfare,  and 
     are willing to help each other out in  practical  ways.  However, 
     coven  leaders  are  expected  to  have a special ability to help 
     coveners explore the roots of their personal problems and  choose 
     strategies  and tactics to overcome them.  This is not to suggest 
     that one must be a trained psychoanalyst;  but at the least, good 
     listening  skills,  clear  thinking  and  some insight into human 
     nature  are  helpful.  Often,  magickal  skills  such  as  guided 
     visualization,  Tarot counseling and radiasthesia (pendulum work) 
     are valuable tools as well.  

     Think  carefully  about  your skills in these areas,  as you have 
     demonstrated them in other organizations.  Ask  acquaintances  or 
     co-workers,  who can be trusted to give you a candid opinion, how 
     they see you in some of these roles.  Meditate,  and decide  what 
     you  really  want for yourself in organizing the new group.  Will 
     you be content with being a catalyst and contact person -- simply 
     bringing people with a common interest together, then letting the 
     group guide its destiny from that point on?  Would you rather  be 
     a facillitator, either for the first months or permanently: a low-
     key  discussion leader who enables the group to move forward with 
     a minimum of  misunderstanding  and  wasted  energy?  Or  do  you 
     really want to be High Priestess -- whatever that means to you -- 
     and  serve  as  the  guiding  spirit and acknowledged leader of a 
     coven?  And if you do want that job,  exactly how much  authority 
     and  work do you envision as part of it?  Some coven leaders want 
     a great deal of power and control;  others simply take  an  extra 
     share  of  responsibility  for setting up the rituals (whether or 
     not they actually  conduct  the  rites),  and  act  as  "magickal 
     advisor"  to  less experienced members.  Thus the High Priest/ess 
     can be the center around which the life of the coven revolves, or 
     primarily an honorary title, or anything in between.  


                                                                             545

     That is one area which you will need  to  have  crystal-clear  in 
     your  own  mind before the first meeting (of if you are flexible, 
     at least be very clear that you are).  You must also be clear  as 
     to your personal needs on other points:  program emphasis,  size, 
     meeting schedule,  finances,  degree of secrecy,  and affiliation 
     with  a  tradition or network.  You owe it to prospective members 
     and to yourself to make your minimum requirements known from  the 
     outset:  it can be disastrous to a group to discover that members 
     have major disagreements on these  points  after  you  have  been 
     meeting for six months.

                                 BLOOD SACRIFICE 
                               by Althea Whitebirch

          We  have all moved through periods of crisis in our  lives;  things
     ranging  from the sublime to the ridiculous,  from the death of  someone
     close to us to final exams.  Events which are extremely stressful--which
     threaten  our lives,  home,  future or security--would seem t  call  for
     strong  measures of assistance.   There have been many times that I have
     felt that the course of events required swift and strong intervention of
     a deity. Blood sacrifice is, to my mind, one of the more powerful magics
     one could perform,  and so seemed particularly suitable for  this.   But
     it's rather ethically sticky.

          I  may feel that the kind of energy contained in the outpouring  of
     blood would be most efficacious in a serious situation, but I'm dead-set
     against the use of an unwilling victim for the purpose.  So, in the past
     I've spilled my own blood with an athame,  at the same time  offering up
     prayers;  it  just  didn't seem to work as well as I thought  it  would.
     Perhaps,  I thought, one needs lots of blood to generate any appreciable
     amount of energy.

          Then  a  friend suggested what seemed the  perfect  solution--blood
     donation!   I'd been giving blood for several years and the thought just
     never had occurred to me before.  So the next time I went in to donate, I
     approached it as ritual sacrifice for a particular purpose, and both the
     process and results seemed to be much improved.  Since then I've gone to
     donate  blood  many times,  each time with a prayer for healing for  the
     recipient of my blood,  and a request for aid from the deity that  seemed
     most appropriate.

          For those of you who've never donated blood before, I can provide a
     few details of the process.   It's not very frightening, and it can be a
     very spiritually moving experience,  I'll tell you!   As well,  remember
     that you don't sell blood (at least not in Puget Sound), you donates it.
     You  can sell plasma--the straw-colored fluid that makes up the bulk of
     your blood--but not blood itself.

         The  first  time you go in you'll fill out a medical  questionnaire:
     the  Puget Sound Blood Bank doesn't want your blood if you're ill  right
     then (or just getting over something),  taking certain medications, ever
     had hepatitis or malaria, or are in a high-risk category for contracting
     AIDS (Haitian,  homosexual,  needle-using drug user or prostitute).   If
     you have any questions, they'll be happy to answer them.

          After  you  fill out the questionnaire,  they'll  take  your  blood
     pressure  and  a blood sample (like sticking your finger with a pin)  to
     test  your hemocrit (% of hemoglobin) as well as determining  what  type
     your  blood is.   If your hemocrit count isn't high enough they'll  send
     you  home.     Nowadays,  all  blood is sent to a lab to be  tested  for
     presence  of  AIDS  anti-bodies as well;  if you test  positive  they'll
     notify  you by mail.   You'll be asked if you've eaten in the last  four
     hours, and if not, sent to the canteen for cookies and juice.


                                                                             547

          Then comes the fun part--you go lie down on a table where a phlebo-
     tomist  (who  draws the blood) asks you some  questions,  verifies  your
     name, and then sets you up to donate. They tie a rubber hose around your
     arm,  so  the vein will stand out and be easy to find.   They  use  cold
     liquid ethyl chloride on your arm,  to numb it where the needle goes in.
     I  won't  say that it doesn't hurt when the needle is inserted--it  does
     but it's tolerable--when it's in place though,  you'll hardly know  it's
     there.   (You  may get the idea from all this that I'm a  stoic--hardly!
     I'm a wimp when it comes to pain,  but this I can handle.)  At this time
     they'll  leave  you  there for up to five minutes while you  clench  and
     relax  your hand (to keep the blood from clotting) and the  blood  flows
     into  a little plastic bag.   It's warm and red,  and rather reassuring,
     really.   At this time you can get into some really serious  prayer,  or
     hum  a  little healing chant for the person your blood's going  to.   (I
     once  was  doing  this and got a flash image of a  little  boy,  a  burn
     victim.   I  always  wondered who got my blood that  day.)   I  wouldn't
     recommend getting too spaced-out though;  remember you've got to be able
     to  return  to yourself when you want to,  and the physical  effects  of
     giving blood can make some people light-headed or slightly woozie.  When
     they ask you how you're feeling,  be honest,  not macho.  You don't want
     to embarrass yourself by fainting.

          Afterwards they'll ask you to have some juice and cookies.   By all
     means,  do!   For one thing, you've earned them; for another it's impor-
     tant  to  replace the fluid and blood sugar you just gave  up.   Working
     magic really takes it out of you, too (at least it does me).

          In my experience, there are several good reasons to use this parti-
     cular method of blood sacrifice: a)  It doesn't require the death of one
     of  the Gods' children.   b)  It is giving of yourself--for the good  of
     others as well as your own.  c)  It is safe--the Blood Bank uses sterile
     instruments and never  re-uses needles, so you can't catch anything.  d)
     You have the added benefit of being able to see the blood as it's  being
     given  (somehow  that adds to my experience),  and a pint is a lot  more
     than I've ever been able to get with a knife!  Next time you want to get
     the Gods' attention, try it!

                              FOUR WEEK FAST 
     *
     FIRST WEEK
     *
     If you normally eat meat, begin to eliminate it from your diet
     during this first week. If you feel you must eat it, eat a small
     amount and no more than 3 times during the week.
     *
     Eliminate all alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages (except for
     bottled waters such as Artesia, etc.), and diet drinks. Substitute
     fruit juices or fruit drinks.
     *
     Refrain from smoking (anything), or using any other intoxicants.
     *
     Cut way back on any other stimulants, such as coffee or tea or
     cocoa. No more than three cups a day if you are a heavy coffee or
     tea drinker.
     *
     Use as little salt as possible and no other spices.
     *
     Refrain from sweets - cakes, pies, candy.
     *
     Drink large amounts of fluids, especially water.
     *
     *
     SECOND WEEK
     *
     Eliminate meat entirely. Substitute dairy products - IN MODERATION.
     *
     Continue to limit intake of stimulants (coffee, tea, cocoa),
     cutting back to no more than two cups a day.
     *
     Continue to avoid tobacco, alcohol, other intoxicants, spices,
     and soft drinks, and use as little salt as possible.
     *
     Continue to drink large amounts of water.
     *
     Your diet should consist largely of vegetables and grains, with
     large amounts of liquids.
     *
     *
     THIRD WEEK
     *
     Limit intake of stimulants (coffee, tea, cocoa) to one cup a day.
     *
     Continue to avoid tobacco, alcohol, other intoxicants, meat,
     spices, and soft drinks, and use as little salt as possible.
     *
     Do not use meat in seasoning vegetables.
     *
     Your diet should consist of vegetables and fruits only. Raw
     vegetables and fruits are best (nuts can be included). Drink large
     amounts of water and substitute fruit or vegetable juices for meals
     as often as possible.
     *

     FOURTH WEEK (first four days)
     *


                                                                             549

     Fluids only. Fruit and vegetable juices in desired quantity,
     cutting back each day. Drink large amounts of water. If you feel
     you must have coffee, limit it to a cup a day (a half cup if
     possible).
     *
     If you feel you must have something the first day or so of this
     week, a small handful of raisins or other dried fruit may be taken.
     Nibble slowly. As the week progresses, continue to cut back on
     nibbles and the amount of juice taken. A spoonful of honey added
     to hot water helps satisfy the craving for hot beverages and gives
     you an energy boost.
     *
     *
     THE FAST
     *
     The fast should last for three days. It is best to do this on a
     weekend and if possible, alone and in the woods. (Go camping!)
     *
     Drink lots of water and if you feel the need for an energy
     stimulant, a small amount of honey may be added to hot water.
     *
     Spend as much time as possible in meditation. This period should
     sooth your spirit as well as cleanse your body. RELAX!
     *
     You will probably want to sleep a lot. Do so. Allow yourself to
     drift with your thoughts. Do not attempt to solve your problems
     during this time. They will solve themselves later, for your mind
     will be clearer after the fast is over.
     *
     Most people feel great the first day, a little weakness the second
     day, and great again on the third day.
     *
     *
     AFTER THE FAST
     *
     Eat lightly for your first meal after the fast. It is best to begin
     by returning to fruit and vegetable juices and working your slowly
     into solid foods over a few days.
     *
     *
     THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS TO DRINK LARGE AMOUNTS OF
     WATER ALL THE WAY THROUGH! This flushes out toxins the body is
     releasing.

                              THE ANCIENT ART 


     Once upon a time, a long time ago, there were people who believed 
     in laughter,  joy and love.   They believed in many deities,  but 
     the most important to them was their Great Mother Goddess.   They 
     believed in and lived with the powers of Nature.  They reveled in 
     the Wind,  the Rain, the Snow and the Sunlight.  They marveled at 
     and  revered  the changing of the seasons and saw  therein  great 
     excitement  and  wisdom to be gained.   They knew  that  if  they 
     tended,  cared  for  and  loved the Earth,  in return  She  would 
     provide for,  care for and love them.   They saw that all  around 
     them  the  world was filled with Life,  much as their own but  in 
     many  different and wonderful forms.   They felt the life of  the 
     flowers,  plants  and  trees  and respected them  for  that  life 
     essence.   They  looked about and observed all the many types  of 
     animals  and saw that they were kindred to them and  loved  them.  
     They  felt  and observed the great Love of the Goddess all  about 
     them  and knew kinship with the Moon.   They were practioners  of 
     The Old Religion, worshipers of The Great Mother.

     Witch!   The  very word instantly invokes visions for each of us, 
     visions which vary greatly from individual to  individual.   Many 
     of these visions, however, are quite false, brought about by many 
     centuries of severe persecutions,  misrepresentations, prejudice 
     and,  in recent years, lack of knowledge. Witchcraft!  What is it 
     really?

     Witchcraft  is the oldest,  most irrepressible religion  in  the 
     world  because it stimulates the intellect,  promotes a  simple, 
     practical  way  of life and,  most importantly,  is  emotionally 
     satisfying.  Its roots lie in the ancient Matriarchal systems of 
     Goddess  worship.   A  religion of Nature in which  the  primary 
     deity  is female (The Essence of Femininity,  The Earth  Mother, 
     The Great Mother, etc.).

     It  was  easy for the Wise Ones to look at the world around  them 
     and see the great importance of Feminine Principle.   The  female 
     was,  indeed,  the  one  who  bore the young,  perhaps  the  most 
     magickal of all events to ancient man.   Then,  she played by far 
     the  most  important role in rearing  the  young,  being  totally 
     responsible  for feeding,  for without her milk there was no life 
     past birth.   She was responsible for the teaching and early care 
     of the young.   In all youths the greatest comfort and  nurturing 
     love  were  connected  with the mother.   These  revelations  and 
     experiences could hardly lead to any other choice than the  total 
     reverence and deification of the female.

     Although  The Great Mother is the most important  deity,  Witches 
     do,  generally,  recognize  many Goddesses and/or Gods and  are, 
     therefore,  polytheistic.   The tenets of Witchcraft are few  but 
     all-encompassing,  for  with three simple Universal  Observations
     all of life can be explained and understood:


                     1)  Reincarnation  - Mortality
                     2)  Cause & Effect - Magick
                     3)  Retribution    - Morality

     Reincarnation  enlightens the Witch to the fact that,  as we come 


                                                                             551

     to  this  material world over and over in a  series  of  learning 
     periods,  or lifetimes, we will eventually have to experience all 
     things,  be  all things,  understand all things.   This creates a 
     great tolerance for other viewpoints in the Witch.

     Cause & Effect,  and an understanding of it,  allows the Witch to 
     see  what makes the world work and how to live most  efficiently.  
     It  gives them a great advantage in that it explains the  working 
     of Magick.

     Retribution shows the Witch, in graphic terms, that every thought 
     one might have,  every action one may take,  is returned in  like 
     kind.   This realization forms the basis of the Moral Code of the 
     Witch.

     The  Patriarchal  Societies which evolved in later times  had  no 
     tolerance for the Goddess religions and systematically set out to 
     destroy the material vestiges,  kill or convert the adherents and 
     wipe  out all knowledge of them.  They destroyed the temples  and 
     other  places  of  worship,  desecrated  the  sacred  groves  and 
     magickal places,  attempted to pervert the old deities, mutilated 
     and totally suppressed sacred art, tore down libraries and burned 
     books,   tortured  and  killed  the  practitioners  of  the   Old 
     Religions,  demeaned,  persecuted  and oppressed women in general 
     and  passed  strictly enforced laws which made theirs  the  State 
     Religion and forbade all other viewpoints.  

     Despite  the  centuries  of  insidious  persecution,   deliberate 
     destruction  and  perversions  at  the  hands  of  the  Christian 
     Conspirators, Witchcraft has survived.



                             COMMON INQUIRIES



     I've  heard the terms 'White Witch' and 'Black Witch'.   Can  you 
     explain?

     In  this connotation,  white is referring to Positive,  Black  is 
     referring to Negative.   A White Witch then is someone who  tries 
     to do Positive or Good things.   Black Witch could be a term used 
     to describe someone who deliberately does Negative or Bad things.  
     A  True Witch believes in the Law of Retribution and would  never 
     deliberately  harm anyone or anything or participate in  Negative 
     or Destructive acts.

     Is  it  possible  for  me to practice  Witchcraft  and  remain  a 
     Christian?

     No.    The   Christian  Doctrine  states,   unequivocally,   that 
     Christians  shall  have no other Gods before the  Christian  God.  
     Christian  Doctrine  says to believe in any other deities  or  to 
     practice  any  other  religion is not only  evil  but  should  be 
     punished by death, specifically naming Witchcraft.  The Christian 
     Doctrine  also denies Reincarnation and prescribes punishment for 
     those who practice Magick.


     Devil worship?

     Witches   do  not  worship  the   Devil.    Witchcraft   predates 
     Christianity  and does not incorporate a belief in the  Christian 
     Devil.

     The  Wise Ones did deify the Masculine Principle and quite  often 
     He  was depicted as The Great Horned God;   Pan,  Cernunnos,  the 
     Great  Stag,  The Green Man.   To the  Traditional  Witch,  the 
     Masculine Deity (the Goddess' Consort) is very important, revered 
     and loved.   He is the perfect Father,  the Lord Protector.   The 
     Horned God of the Witches is loving, kind and good.


     Don't men have difficulty with a supreme female deity?  There are 
     some  groups  which  give equal status to  the  female  and  male 
     deities.

     Neo-Pagans are,  by definition,  people who attempt to live  with 
     the Old Country Ways in a new,  modern day manner.  And while, in 
     this modern era,  equal status for the deities may be popular, as 
     it   relates   to  Witchcraft  it  is   historically   incorrect.  
     Therefore,  a  group  which  does not recognize  the  Goddess  as 
     primary  deity is not practicing The Ancient Art.  Indeed,  they, 
     generally,  know  very  little about  Witchcraft,  despite  their 
     claims.   Traditional  Dualistic  Witches  do  most  emphatically 
     believe  that  women  and  men are equal,  but  have  no  trouble 
     relating to the Goddess.   The Male Witch finds great comfort and 
     solace in his Great Mother.


     Do I have to join a Coven?

     No.   It  is not necessary nor is it desirable for a  great  many 
     people.   Some people enjoy the support and companionship a Coven 
     provides,  others enjoy solitary worship.  The Coven, which is an 
     extremely close knit worship group,  may not be possible for some 
     because of location, family climate, availability, etc. 


                                                                             553

     Why is Witchcraft secretive?

     The horror of the 'Burning Time' is still very real to the Witch.  
     The  past persecutions were severe.   Even so,  in today's  more 
     enlightened  society the need for complete secrecy  has  lessened 
     and  many  are  able to share their beliefs  openly.   Very  few, 
     however,  are  willing to expose their very personal and  private 
     religious expressions to others who may not understand.


     What do I have to do to become a Witch?

     The  answer to this question is very simple.   To become a  Witch 
     one must follow the religion of Witchcraft.   To do this one must 
     believe  in  the Goddess as primary deity and  follow  the  three 
     basic  tenets.   How  simple!   How  uncomplicated!   How  Pagan!  
     Everything  else  concerning witchcraft is simply minor  details.  
     Details  that  vary from Aspect to Aspect,  Coven  to  Coven  and 
     individual  to individual.   The details are relatively personal.  
     They should not become more important than the basic tenets.   If 
     you do not understand,  believe and practice Witchcraft,  you are 
     not a Witch.   No one can make you a Witch.  Reading about it can 
     not  make you a Witch.   An Initiation can not make you a  Witch.  
     Saying you are a Witch, one thousand and fifty two times, can not 
     make you a Witch.

     In  the search for your individual path beware of those who would 
     take  advantage  of you.   Do not fall prey to  the  unscrupulous 
     charlatans who would swindle you in a monetary sense  (mail-order 
     courses,  charges  for teaching or initiations,  vows of poverty, 
     etc.),  exploit  you  sexually or manipulate you  for  their  own 
     personal ego-trips.

               It seems tobe an immutable law ofnature.  You are interviewedby a
     local radio or  TV station, or in  some local newspaper.  The  topic of the
     interview is  Witchcraft or Paganism, and  you spend the better  part of an
     hour brilliantly  articulating your beliefs,  your devotion to  Goddess and
     nature,  the  difference between  Witchcraft  and  Satanism, and  generally
     enlightening  the public  at large.   The  next day,  you are  flooded with
     calls.  Is it  people complimenting you on such a splendid  interview?  No.
     People  wanting to  find out  more about  the religion  of Wicca?   Huh-uh.
     People who are  even vaguely interested  in what you  had to say???   Nope.
     Who is it?  It's people asking you to do a love spell for them!   This used
     to  drive me nuts.  I'd  take a deep breath and  patiently explain (for the
     thousandth  time) why  I won't even  do love  spells for  myself, let alone
     anyone else.  This generally resulted in my caller becoming either angry or
     defensive, but seldom more  enlightened.  'But don't  you DO magic?',  they
     ask.  'Only occasionally,' I answer.  'And aren't most magic spells love
     spells?', they persist.   That was the line I really  hated, because I knew
     they were right!   At least, if you look  at the table of contents  of most
     books on  magic, you'll find more  love spells than  any other kind.   This
     seems  as  true for  the  medieval  grimoire as  for  the modern  drugstore
     paperback.  

           Why?  Why so many books containing so many love spells?  Why such an
     emphasis on a kind of magic that I, personally, have always considered very
     negative?  And to make matters even more  confusing, the books that do take
     the trouble  of dividing  spells between  'positive'  and 'negative'  magic
     invariably list love spells under the first heading.  After all, they would
     argue,  love  is  a  good thing.    There  can  never be  too  much  of it.
     Therefore, any  spell that brings about  love must be a GOOD  spell.  Never
     mind that  the spell puts a straightjacket on another's free will, and then
     drops it in cement for good measure.  


                                                                             555

                 And thatis whyI hadalways assumedlove magicto benegative magic.
     Years ago,  one  of the  first  things I  learned  as a  novice  Witch  was
     something called the  Witch's Rede, a kind of  'golden rule' in traditional
     Witchcraft.   It states, 'An  it harm none, do  what thou will.'   One uses
     this rede as  a kind  of ethical litmus  test for  a spell.   If the  spell
     brings harm to someone -- anyone (including yourself!) -- then don't do it!
     Unfortunately,  this rule contains  a loophole  big enough  to fly  a broom
     through.   It's commonly expressed, 'Oh, this  won't HARM them; it's really
     for their own good.'   When you hear someone say that,  take cover, because
     something especially nasty is about to happen.  

           That's why I had to develop my own version of the Witch's Rede.  Mine
     says that  if a spell harms  anyone, OR LIMITS THEIR FREEDOM  OF THOUGHT OR
     ACTION IN  ANY WAY,  then consider it  negative, and don't  do it.   Pretty
     strict, you  say?  Perhaps.   But there's another law  in Witchcraft called
     the  Law of Threefold Return.  This  says that whatever power you send out,
     eventually  comes back to  you three  times more  powerful.   So I  take no
     chances.    And  love  spells,  of  the  typical  make-Bobby-love-me  type,
     definitely have an impact on another's free will.  

                 Sowhy are they so common? It's taken me yearsto make peace with
     this, but I think I finally understand.  The plain truth is that most of us
     NEED love.  Without it, our lives are empty and miserable.  After our basic
     survival needs have been met, we must have affection  and companionship for
     a full life.   And if it will not come of its own accord, some of us may be
     tempted to  FORCE it  to come.   And nothing  can be  as painful  as loving
     someone  who doesn't  love  you  back.    Consequently,  the  most  common,
     garden-variety spell in the world is the love spell.  

                 Is there ever a way to do a love  spell and yet stay within the
     parameters of the Witch's Rede?   Possibly.  Some teachers have argued that
     if a spell doesn't attempt to attract a SPECIFIC person into your life, but
     rather attempts to attract the RIGHT person, whomever that may  be, then it
     is not negative magic.  Even so, one should make sure  that the spell finds
     people who are  'right' for each  other -- so that  neither is harmed,  and
     both are made happy.  

           Is there ever an excuse for the make-Bobby-love-me type of spell? 
     Without  endorsing  this  viewpoint, I  must  admit  that  the most  cogent
     argument in  its favor  is the  following: Whenever you  fall in  love with
     someone, you do everything in your power to impress them.  You dress nicer,
     are  more  attentive, witty,  and  charming.   And  at the  same  time, you
     unconsciously set in motion some very  powerful psychic forces.  If  you've
     ever walked into a room where someone has  a crush on you, you know what  I
     mean.  You can  FEEL it.  Proponents of  this school say that a  love spell
     only takes the  forces that are ALREADY there -- MUST be there if you're in
     love -- and  channels them more efficiently.  But the energy would be there
     just the same, whether or not you use a spell to focus it.  

                 Iwon't attempt to decidethis one for you. People must arrive at
     their own set of ethics through their own considerations.  However, I would
     call to  your attention all the  cautionary tales in folk  magic about love
     spells  gone awry.   Also, if  a love spell  has been employed  to join two
     people who are  not naturally compatible, then one must keep pumping energy
     into the spell.  And when one finally tires of this  (and one will, because
     it  is hard  work!) then  the spell  will unravel  amidst an  emotional and
     psychic  hurricane that  will  make the  stormiest  divorces seem  calm  by
     comparison.  Not a pretty picture.  
           It should be noted that many spells that pass themselves off as love
     spells  are, in reality, sex spells.   Not that there's anything surprising


                                                                             556

     in  that, since our most  basic needs usually include sex.   But I think we
     should be  clear from the outset  what kind of spell  it is.   And the same
     ethical standards used for love spells can often be applied  to sex spells.
     Last year, the very quotable Isaac Bonewits, author of 'Real Magic', taught
     a sex  magic  class here  at the  Magick  Lantern, and  he tossed  out  the
     following rule of  thumb: Decide what the mundane equivalent  of your spell
     would be, and ask yourself  if you could be arrested for it.   For example,
     some spells are  like sending a letter to your beloved in the mail, whereas
     other  spells are tantamount to  abduction.  The  former is perfectly legal
     and normal, whereas the latter is felonious.  

                 One mitigating  factor in your decisions may  be the particular
     tradition
     of magic you follow.  For example, I've often noticed that practitioners of
     Voudoun (Voodoo) and Santeria seem much more focused on the wants and needs
     of day-to-day living than on the abstruse ethical considerations we've been
     examining here.  That's not a value judgement -- just an observation.  For
     example,  most followers  of Wicca  STILL don't  know how  to react  when a
     Santerian priest  spills the blood  of a chicken  during a ritual  -- other
     than to  feel pretty queasy.  The  ethics of one culture  is not always the
     same as another.  

           And speaking of cultural traditions, another consideration is how a
     culture views love and sex.  It has often been pointed out that in our
     predominant culture, love and sex are seen in very possessive terms,  where
     the beloved is regarded as one's personal property.  If the spell uses this
     approach,  treating a person as an object,  jealously attempting to cut off
     all other relationships, then the ethics  are seriously in doubt.  However,
     if the spell takes a  more open approach to love and sex, not attempting to
     limit a  person's other relationships in  any way, then perhaps  it is more
     defensible.  Perhaps.  Still, it might be wise to ask, Is this the  kind of
     spell I'd want someone to cast on me?  

                 Love spells. Whether to dothem or not. If you area practitioner
     of magic,  I dare say you  will one day be  faced with the choice.   If you
     haven't yet, it is  only a matter of time.  And if  the answer is yes, then
     which  spells are ethical and  which aren't?  Then  you, and only you, will
     have to decide whether 'All's fair in  love and war', or whether there  are
     other, higher, metaphysical considerations.  


                                                                             557

                                DRAWING DOWN THE MOON 

     In  this ritual the  Goddess becomes incarnate  in the High  Priestess. The
     High Priestess stands  in front of the altar with her back to it. She holds
     the wand in  her right hand and  the scrounge in her left.  She crosses her
     wrists and  crosses the  wand and  scrounge above  them while  holding them
     close to her breast.  The High Priest stands in front of her and says:    

          "Diana, queen of night
          In all your beauty bright,
          Shine on us here,
          And with your silver beam
          Unlock the gates of dream;
          Rise bright and clear.
          On Earth and sky and sea,
          Your magic mystery
          Its spell shall cast,
          Wherever leaf may grow,
          Wherever tide may flow,
          Till all be past.
          O secret queen of power,
          At this enchanted hour
          We ask your boon.
          May fortune's favor fall
          Upon true witches all,
          O Lady Moon!"

     The High  Priest kneels before  the High Priestess  and gives her  the Five
     Fold  Kiss; that is,  he kisses her  on both  feet, both knees,  womb, both
     breasts, and the lips, starting with the right of each pair. He says, as he
     does this:

          "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways.
          Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar.
          Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be.
          Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty.
          Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names."

     For the kiss on the  lips, they embrace, length to length, with  their feet
     touching each others. When he reaches  the womb, she spreads her arms wide,
     and the same  after the kiss on the  lips.The High Priest kneels  again and
     invokes:

          "I invoke thee and call upon thee, Mighty Mother of us all,
              bringer of all fruitfulness; by seed and root,
              by bud     and stem, by leaf and flower and fruit,
                       bylife and love doI invoke theeto descend uponthe body of
     this,
              thy servant and priestess."


                                                                             558

     During this invocation  he touches  her with  his right  forefinger on  her
     right breast,  left breast, and womb, repeats the set and finally the right
     breast. Still  kneeling, he spreads his  arms out and down,  with the palms
     forward and says:

          "Hail Aradia! From the Amalthean Horn
          Pour forth thy store of love; I lowly bend
          Before thee, I adore thee to the end,
          With loving sacrifice thy shrine adore.
          Thy foot is to my lip
          (he kisses her right foot)      
          my prayer up borne
          Upon the rising incense smoke; then spend
          Thine ancient love, O Mighty One, descend
          To aid me, who without thee am forlorn."

     The High Priest stands up and steps backwards. The High Priestess draws the
     Invoking Pentagram of Earth in the air with the wand and says:

          "Of the Mother darksome and divine
          Mine the scrounge, and mine the kiss;
          The five point star of love and bliss
          Here I charge you in this sign."

     The High Priestess should be in a trance now. This is a good time to do the
     Charge or the Witches' Creed.

     When the Charge or Creed is finished, the Goddess must be dismissed.  It is
     bad magical practice not to do so.

     The High Priest faces the Priestess and says:

          "We thank  you Our Lady for  attending our rites. We  bid you farewell
     till 
              next we call you. Blessed Be."

                                  CALLING ALL CRONES 
                                     by Grey Cat
      
     Into  the  dark, the pale light of the waning moon  brings  forth 
     shapeless shadows; bushes, a wandering stone fieldwall,  nameless 
     areas  of blackness.  Some still, some moving; no night for  good 
     folk  to stray from cot or castle.  Black hares amove across  the 
     moors,  black cattle idly gossip together, one old woman  dressed 
     in black searches the grass for secret herbs.  And there  amongst 
     the standing stones, age heavy upon their backs, three hags  dare 
     all the mercy of God's Holy Mother Church to make the magic of an 
     older race. 
      
     ``Call  old  Mother  Piggot,  she  knows  the  proper  words  for 
     warts.''...   ``Tis  Goody  Nurse you'll need if it's  a  son  ye 
     want.''...   ``Tis  naught but an Old Wives  Tale.''...   ``Don't 
     mind  Mother, she hasn't been herself since she went through  the 
     Change of Life.'' 
      
     Looming high over the imagination of humankind, the shadow of the 
     Crone casts a miasma of fear and uselessness, power and casting-- 
     out, across the myths of our race and society. 
          I  have  talked and talked to women who either  have  arrived  at 
     crone  time or who are preparing themselves for  this  transition 
     and  we  have found much to talk about.  And I think that  it  is 
     important  that  we  keep right on talking after  the  season  of 
     Gatherings  has  passed  for  the year.   I  have  absolutely  no 
     interest  in trying to start a newsletter for Crones, nor  really 
     of  founding  OWL (Old Woman's League), SOW  (Salty  Old  Women), 
     CRONE (Clearly Rational Older Natural Energy), nor HAG (Honorable 
     Aged Geniuses). 
          However, I, no more than many of you, want to have to wait  until 
     next  year  to  get a chance to  discuss  all  these  fascinating 
     topics.   So how about some suggestions, and perhaps some  offers 
     of  help.   Would  we  like to cooperate  in  an  APAZine*  which 
     dispenses  with an editing and layout burden, leaving some  low-- 
     level  bookkeeping which I don't mind doing.  Does  someone  feel 
     like  working  on  a  Newsletter?  Do we want  to  form  a  loose 
     organization as part of or instead of the above?  Or are most  of 
     us too busy to do anything about this between gatherings? 
          I'll  be sending this letter to people I know personally  and  to 
     many  Pagan publications; you'll probably see it often enough  to 
     be  sick  of  the  whole idea.  But there  is  a  lot  of  magick 
     available  in  the  Time  of  the  Crone.   There  is  a  lot  of 
     sociological pressure to understand, combat or accept.  And there 
     is  a whole lot of our lives left for us to function  as  Crones. 
     If we don't figure out what it is and what to do with it,  nobody 
     else will. 
          So  write me at the address below (SASE appreciated) and  let  me 
     know  what  you  think about the whole idea, what  you  might  be 
     willing  to  do, what insights you may have about Crone  Time  -- 
     let's figure out what has been left out of all the books.   We're 
     already ``Uppity Women'' and we've nothing to lose but a bad rap. 
     (Crones  are  assumed  to be women more or less  at  the  age  of 
     menopause or past it.  Baby Crones are any who realize that  this 
     time is not far away.)

                                    THE AUTARCHIC CREED 
      
     We of the Old Religion have our own particular compact with our
     deities that charges simply, "An it harm none, do as ye will."
     And our gods do not despise us for being human but delight in our
     celebrations of life and love. We are ageless souls, only for a
     while within bodies - merely visitors upon this plane. We are
     brothers to the gods and only temporarily cousins to the ape,
     and our lives belong to us, not to this world nor to its earthly
     governors. We are not doomed to shame and decay; not lost; not
     indentured to perish with earthly manifestations; not disposed
     to eternal misery for any past or present lapses of courage or
     wisdom. We are as children in the school of life who must learn
     our lessons, on life at a time, before we graduate. Our lives
     span the march of time, striving upward, subordinate only to our
     individual probity and growth.
      
     But in this mortal life, greedy, trivial hierophants and mundane
     rulers have perpetrated a fraud upon humanity. They have purloined
     for profit and temporal power, our legitimate heritage, and that of
     all society, and have substituted for it shame, despair, and fear,
     inventing evil deities to terrify and to constrain mankind from the
     exercise of his own native conscience.
      
     Still we take our uncertain portion time and again, joining with the 
     species on this plane, only to meet with earthly disunity and distress;
     only to be told by bogus, uncelestial shepherds that we are deficient
     and fundamentally iniquitous; constantly rebuked that our natural
     birthright is insubstantial or even sinful, and that we must cleave
     to the pious injunctions of reigning mortals, no matter how oppressive,
     or suffer beyond measurable time, yearning for some mythical golden
     glory just out of reach, but somehow never quite worthy of it.
      
     That is the apocryphal hell and the fabled satan; they are of mortal
     creation; they are now, not in some remote bye-and-bye; and those who
     choose to believe in them perpetuate them in this earth. But nevertheless,
     by sublime design, despite narrowness, folly or fear, we all, each
     and every one, possess this wondrous legacy:
      
      that each of us sustains a singular covenant with the cosmic, in that
     the soul is and ever was, one with the universe, conducting itself in
     concordance with the absolute. And whatever paths it may walk, or 
     whichever faith it may follow, on sojourn at a time, each shall as a
     consequence of that oneness, and attuning with its destiny, eventually
     return on its own to its source to again be part of that totality,
     atoned, aware and unshackled.

                                      Zhahai Stewart


     What to do if you think you are being attacked. 
      
      1 - Question if it is really either imagination, or coming from within
     yourself.  Something may be trying to get your attention, but it may not be
     external, and by focussing on an external "enemy" you may be missing the
     point. 
      
      2 - Check to see if you are yourself inadvertently sending something out;
     maybe someone is just reflecting some energy back!  Nothing is gained if you
     get into adversarial mode in that case.  Many people have been taught that
     reflecting is the proper response. 
      
      3 - Put up a grounding shield.  Ground it out, send it to the Mother who
     can recycle the energy.  Grounding is usually taught to every student. If you
     don't feel you can be a "conduit" safely, ground it by reflecting  it
     downward to the Earth; that is a big target and easy to hit.  By  grounding
     it out, you are protecting yourself, yet not being caught up in it. 
      
      What not to do. 
      
      1 - Figure out who is sending it and counter attack.  You might be wrong,
     and may be starting a feud.  You might be right, but they may not realize
     that they are "sending" so you may start a feud or cause unnecessary harm.
     Even if you are right, you are escalating a feud, of which we have too many.
     This is commonly discussed as a bad idea. 
      
      2 - Put up a reflective shield which will return the energy to the sender.
     This is commonly discussed as a good idea, but we disagree.  We think this is
     unwise. 
      
      For one thing, it is not necessary; if you can make an accurate return
     reflection, you can certainly reflect it to Earth instead (where it can be
     recycled).  There is no reason you should not be able to ground out more
     energy than you can accurately reflect to the sender, if viewed properly. 
      
      For another, your accuracy in returning it may be less than perfect.  You
     might hit close but not close enough; if you can't reflect it to earth, you
     are going to have trouble reflecting it to an unknown person. 
      
      Sometimes this is discussed as if once you return it, the sender will just
     stop; because they will awaken to what they are doing, or because the
     returning energy will be too much to handle. The thing which is seldom
     mentioned is that if the sender (assuming there is one) was consciously
     attacking, they will likely already be prepared with their own mirrors, etc. 
     Great, if we put near perfect mirrors at each end and pump in energy, maybe
     we can get a psychic laser effect; guess who is just on the other side of the
     mirrors to catch the intensified leakthru? 
      


                                                                                  565

      If they weren't aware of sending, they will probably just assume they are 
     being attacked and take countermeasures.  If they follow the 3 steps above,
     fine, nothing is damaged.  But many of them will immediately think they  have
     to put up a defensive mirror, or maybe worse (see below; they may decide to
     teach you a lesson for attacking them).  Few people naturally respond to
     perceived attacks positively (especially if they are in such a bad mood
     already as to be sending without even realizing it). 
      
      Another serious concern is getting drawn into a unacknowledged feud by your
      own weaknesses.  It is often agreed that one should reflect back exactly
     what is received, without adding anything of one's own.  But the same people
     who advocate that may use terms implying "returning it with enthusiasm".
     There appears to be an easily tapped source of self-righteousness in most
     people feeling attacked, and it is _very hard_ not to get drawn into
     imagining, at some level, the satisfying effects of the energy going back to
     the attacker; that draws one into a "counter-attack" even without realizing
     it.  Grounding it does not. 
      
      Watch for yourself when people are discussing "returning to sender"; see if
     there isn't very often a hidden desire for revenge or retribution lurking
     there grasping for their "control panel" - and deflecting their normal
     attempts at staying centered by claiming to do no more than is "justified".
     Justified is not the question; self knowledge and balance are. 
      
      There is another thread which shows up often in discussions like these; the
     need to "teach the sender a lesson".  In some cases, I have even heard this
     justified as "protecting the community".  This way lies many PRINT D did
     the goddess give you an "agent of threefold return" marshall's badge, that
     exempts you from any consequences "because you are just an agent"?  That 
     hubris is gonna teach some hard lessons, but the self appointed marshall may
     be the major recipient.  It would be a little bit healthier to just shed the 
     self-righteousness and call it an ego driven feud.  "Teaching them a lesson"
     gets filed under the pitfalls of righteousness, the ways that one's own 
     weaknesses seduce one. 
      
      Also consider, what if despite your initial impression, the negative energy
     is really coming from inside, from part of you?  Are you going to be better
     off "reflecting it back" (maybe with additional conscious or  unconscious
     oomph) or grounding it?  "Gee, I returned it but good, and now  they have
     stepped it up; the sender really needs a lesson!".  That may be more true
     than you know, bucko. 
      
      Notice that nowhere do we say that one has no "right" to put up a
     reflective shield; of course one does, and is fully justified.  Also,
     possibly, unwise. There is a distinction between what one has a "right" to do
     in "self defense", and what is wise to get drawn into.  Reflecting it is
     neither necessary, nor likely to produce positive results, but if _that
     itself_ is the lesson to  be learned, what can I say?  Each chooses their own
     path, and that is as it should be.  At least if one has considered the above,
     one should know what they are stepping into.

                            ETHICS OR ETIQUETTE 
                                 by Ellen

          Recently  in  conversation with friends in a small  intimate 
     gathering,  I  mentioned outer-court names and passed on  gossip.  
     Later I was told that I had "violated etiquette."  Had I?

          Etiquette  is socially accepted forms  of  behavior,  agreed 
     upon  by the  members of a community.   Ethics involves morality, 
     the  nature of right as determined by a group or an  individual.I 
     believe there is a great deal of confusion of these terms in  the 
     "Pagan Community."

          Going  by  fairly traditional rules there are the  "Laws  of 
     Wicca."   Among these there is a very firm one saying one  should 
     never  reveal another person as a Witch without their permission.  
     However  a  person who has revealed themselves  publicly  as  a 
     witch  shouldn't  complain.   And is it a violation of ethics  to 
     tell of a person by their outer-court name?   Only insiders could 
     know the legal name of the person, so what is the danger? 

          Ethics can be fairly easily agreed upon in the general pagan 
     community.  Anything that puts someone else in an embarrassing or 
     dangerous position is unethical.   We all make mistakes at times, 
     but we try to act in a manner consistent with our ethical code.  
     Etiquette, on the other hand, is very deceiving.  We assume, 
     since  we  are all members of the "Neo-Pagan Community"  that  we 
     have the same etiquette.  But the only etiquette I have ever been 
     explicitly told about involves greetings to be exchanged  between 
     members  of a group and their high priestess or between two  high 
     priestess of different groups.  What about a more common meeting?  

          Say a friend of mine is tired of being a solitary and wishes 
     to  come to a group celebration.   What etiquette should I follow 
     to  bring this person to such a circle?   I could either  contact 
     the group beforehand and ask permission,  or tell them I will  be 
     bringing  a  guest,  or I could simply bring a guest  -  with  no 
     warning at all.   In the first situation,  the responsibility and 
     decision is theirs; in the second I am responsible for my guest's 
     behavior;  in  the third I am a boor and will never be invited to 
     their circles again.

          No  one has covered all the possible conflict situations  in 
     the Pagan Community.   So there is no way I could agree to follow 
     an  "etiquette."  My general code is simply to use common  sense, 
     and give the other person an easy out.  For example, if you think 
     someone else is a Witch and wish to find out, you might tell them  
     that you are one.  To receive trust you have to give it first.


                                                                                  567

          A secondary problem in this situation is how does one keep a 
     secret?  Should  one only speak in whispers,  or when no  one  is 
     within 100 paces?  I think that looks furtive and produces suspi-
     cion in the mind of outsiders. Or do we follow Poe's lead and put 
     the secret out in the open and disarm the opposition? 

          I  know several people who studiously "maintain secrecy" but 
     everyone knows that they are "witches." Worse,  because of  their 
     secrecy,  their  colleagues don't know what a witch is except  it 
     must be nasty since they won't speak of it.  I do not proclaim my 
     religion,  nor do I hide it, and I have never had any problems. I 
     hear  3rd  hand horror stories but would like to hear first  hand 
     experiences, good or bad. Please write me c/o Panegyria.

     Dream News
     ----------


     NUCLEAR NIGHTMARES:  With the threat of nuclear war hanging overhead, it is not
     surprising that our dreams might reflect this source of anxiety.  In fact,
     reports peace psychologist Randy Morris, PhD, many children in our country, not
     to mention in other nations, have had nuclear imagery in their dreams.  Are
     such dreams simply another example of how daily anxieties are reflected in our
     nighttime ruminations?  Possibly, but Dr. Morris offers another explanation. 
     "Could it be some kind of collective survival mechanism to come as close as
     possible to experiencing, in order to reject, our self-destruction?"

     .    "I believe," he states, in answer to his question, "that nuclear
     nightmares represent an impulse on the part of this collective psyche to
     confront directly the horror of nuclear war, literally, to 'imagine the
     unimaginable,' and by so doing to take the first step toward healing this
     festering rupture in the family of man.  These dreams, as expressions of pure
     emotion, have the power to motivate people to work in new ways for peace
     movement."  Dr. Morris notes that the threat of nuclear war is increased by the
     number of people who simply cannot imagine that it would ever happen.  Nuclear
     nightmares tend to be very "real" in their feeling, and thus may be a natural
     counterbalance to the ostrich syndrome.

     .    Anyone who has had a nuclear nightmare, or any kind of dream involving
     nuclear imagery, is invited to write a letter to Randy Morris, PhD, Hiroshima
     International School, 2-2-6 Ushita-naka, Higashi-ku, Hiroshima 730, Japan,
     leave a message in ANECDOTAL PSI or PREMONITIONS REGISTRY.


     SUDDEN DEATH SYNDROME:  SUICIDE BY NIGHTMARE:  A healthy adult goes to sleep at
     night but then never wakes up.  The medical examiners can find no cause of
     death?  What happened.  No one knows, but it happens enough to have earned a
     name, "sudden death syndrome," and to warrant having the Atlanta Center for
     Disease Control monitor the incidence of such cases.  One population group,
     Laotian refugees, has a higher than average mortality from sudden death
     syndrome.  Dr. Joseph Jay Tobin, reporting in the American Journal of
     Orthopsychiatry (July, 1983), presents a case study that leads him to suggest
     that this phenomenon may be suicide by nightmare.

     .   The patient was a male refugee from war-torn Laos, who had been recently
     relocated with his family to their own apartment in an American city.  Shortly
     thereafter, the man complained of difficulty sleeping.  He reported nightmares
     in which something (once a cat, once a dog and once a woman) came to him in his
     bedroom, sat on his chest and tried to prevent his breathing.  Dr. Tobin
     arranged for a Laotian healer to perform a "spirit cure," which was consistent
     with the patient's world view.  Afterwards, Dr. Tobin investigated further into
     the patient's background.


                                                                                  569

     .    Examination of the patient's history revealed that he was suffering from
     "survivor's guilt."  This post-traumatic malady, first identified in survivors
     of the Holocaust, combines depression and paranoia with the nagging feeling,
     "why was I saved when so many others died?"  Dr. Tobin also discovered that
     among South Asian persons there is the belief in something akin to "voodoo
     death," called banqunqut, or "Oriental nightmare death," in which a person is
     believed to be killed during sleep by a spirit which squeezes out the breath. 
     Apparently a similar belief was held in Europe during the Middle Ages.  At that
     time, the name, "incubi" was given to the presumed spirit, from the Latin word
     for nightmare, incubus.

     .    Previous medical research has indicated that heart attacks can be
     precipitated in dreams and that certain psychosomatic disorders can be
     dangerously aggravated during the sleep state.  Other research focussing on the
     healing potential of dreams, nevertheless receives indirect support for the
     physical potency of dreams by the suggestion that they might also be a vehicle
     of death.


     DREAM AFTER SURGERY RESTORES INTEGRITY OF PERSONALITY:  Major surgery is a
     harrowing experience, a trauma to the personality, for the person submits their
     life, while unconscious under anesthesia, to the operation of other people's
     hands upon their vital organs.  The most critical aspect of the surgery
     experience--the operation itself--seems beyond the reach of the patient's
     personality to integrate, as would be needed following any traumatic
     experience, because of the anesthesia.  Patient's occasional reports of
     "witnessing" their operation, and statements, by psychics such as Edgar Cayce
     or philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead, that the mind never sleeps,
     that it registers everything, would suggest that despite the anesthesia, it
     should be theoretically possible for the post-operative patient to regain
     access to the surgery experience so that it could be digested and the recovery
     made more complete.  Dr. Paul W. Pruyser, of the Menninger Foundation,
     reporting in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic (June, 1983) suggests that
     such an integration of the surgery experience may occur through a dream!

     .    Dr. Pruyser writes about his experience undergoing emergency, triple
     coronary bypass surgery and how his recuperation was helped by a dream he had
     five days after the operation.  In his dream, he visits a little-known,
     secluded part of the hospital grounds, a ruins site from the 19th century,
     where he encounters a heavy metal door.  The door opens with eerie creak and he
     enters a dimly lit cave.  He finds three strange, two-story, cubical habitats,
     each with leaky and rusty pipes meant to furnish heat to the inside from a
     centrally located, old-fashioned wood-burning cook stove that was very
     dilapidated.


                                                                                  570

     .    When he awoke from this dream, he reports that he felt elated and
     immensely satisfied, because, in his own words, "my mind had found access to an
     experience I was not supposed to have undergone at all because of the total
     anesthesia."  He believes, for example, that the creaking of the door was
     actually the sound of his rib cage when it was opened by the surgeon.  He
     provides background information to develop an interpretation of the details of
     the dream, which in essence refers to his confrontation with his heart and its
     clogged arteries and with his ancestral history of coronary deficiency.  More
     generally, he ascribes to his dream an act of restoration of the integrity of
     his personality--"a guarantee of the continuity of selfhood"--after being the
     threatened by his near brush with death.  The ability of dreams to spontaneously
     provide this otherwise missing ingredient to total recovery deserves further
     investigation.  (Author's address:  Menninger Foundation, P.O. Box 829, Topeka,

     GROUP DREAMING:  What happens when a group of people attempt to dream about the
     same thing?  The December, 1983 issue of Omni Magazine reports the work of
     Henry Reed (DreamNet Sysop) on an intriguing approach to studying the psychic
     potential of dreams.  A group of dreamers would be gathered together, he would
     introduce them to a stranger said to be suffering from an undisclosed problem,
     and ask the group to dream for this person, to see if they could dream up a
     solution to the person's problem.  In the morning the dreams were analyzed, the
     person's problem was revealed, and the pieces of information from the several
     dreams were pieced together to develop a solution.  Most of the dreams
     evidenced psychic information in the dreams.  Pooling the dreams enhanced the
     visibility of the psychic effect.  Having a good reason for dreaming
     telepathically seems to increase the probability of psychic material in the
     dreams.  For further reading:  "Dreaming for Mary, "Sundance Community Dream

     NEW LUCID DREAM INDUCTION TECHNIQUE:  Robert Price and David Cohen, of the
     University of Texas at Austin, report that they have accidentally discovered a
     method for inducing lucid dreams.  It happened while they were researching the
     ability of a subject to control, while asleep in the dream state, the sounding
     of a tone being played in the dream laboratory.  A biofeedback setup was used,
     such that whenever the sleeping subject entered the dream state, with rapid eye
     movements (REM), a loud tone would be played.  This tone would interrupt sleep,
     but if the subject could increase the amount of rapid eye movements, he could
     terminate the tone, and sleep in peace.  They found that their research subject
     could learn this task.  Then the subject began to report lucid dreaming, that
     is being aware in the dream state that he was dreaming, and reported that he
     tried to move his eyes as a means of signalling to the experimenter.  A
     "communication" system was thus set up between the experimenter and the
     dreaming subject.  The researchers suggest that such a biofeedback situation
     may be an effective way to learn lucid dreaming.  Reported in Lucidity Letter,
     November, 1983 (See Mail Order Services).


     TELEPATHIC DREAMS IN COUNSELING:  A counselor whose dreams provide psychic
     information about clients has a powerful addition to his kit of clinical tools.
     Kenneth Orkin, Ph.D., has written an article entitled, "Telepathic Dreams: 
     Their Application During the Counseling Process," describing his experiences
     with psychic dreaming about clients.  He is in private practice in Miami,
     Florida.  He recounts several types of psychic dreams, including precognitive
     dreaming about the problems of a client who would be coming for a consultation
     in the future, with the dream providing information about the source of that
     person's problem.  He also recounts a story about a dream that provided
     past-life information about a client.  His article appeared in the November,
     1983 issue of A.R.E. Journal.  You may write to the author c/o A.R.E., P.O. Box

     Dream Life & Waking Life: Both are Creations of the Person 
      
     There is a growing appreciation for the variety of dream phenomena, such as
     the  creativity in dreams and their sometimes transpersonal aspects.  Older
     theories that generally ignored such facts are being replaced by newer ones
     that attempt to account for such  phenomena.  Most recently, Gordon Globus,
     M.D.,  Professor  of  Psychiatry  and  Philosophy  at  the   University  of
     California,  Irvine, has taken a  stab at integrating  such perspectives as
     psychoanalysis,   transpersonal   psychology,   cognitive    science,   and
     phenomenological philosophy  in a  pleasantly person-  able statement  of a
     view of dreams that readers of Perspective can live with.  
      
     That dreams  are a creative experience  is one of the main  factors that he
     wishes to  explain.   The author rejects  the notion,  in existence  before
     Freud  made it  law, that dreams  are merely rearrangements  of past memory
     experiences.  Instead, the author claims that dreams are created "de novo,"
     meaning from scratch.  In defending this position, he finds himself arguing
     that our waking life is also an experience that we create, thus placing his
     work  close at  hand to the  metaphysical perspective  that claims  that we
     "create our  own reality."  Both realms are created "in the image" (meaning
     "in the imagination") of the  person, in the same way God has  been said to
     create the world.   The symmetry between the creative  aspect of both dream
     existence and waking existence, and the "divine"  role given to the person,
     is   pleasing   both  to   the  ancient   Buddhist  and   modern  spiritual
     metaphysician.  
      
     The question is, how does this modern, scientifically grounded theoretician
     justify such a metaphysical basis to dreams and waking life?  He does so by
     reference to both the leading edge theories of perceptual psychology and 
     certain philosophical traditions.  Perceptual psychology has long abandoned
     the  camera analogy to explain  how we see things.   Plato's concept of the
     archetype, the  transpersonal, non-material "ideas" that  govern the actual
     ideas  and things  that  we  experience, has  gained  new  favor in  modern
     thinking  about the  perceptual process.   Instead  of theorizing  that our
     perceptual mechanisms  "photograph"  what is  out  there, modern  work  has
     forced the theory that  we already "know" or "suppose"  what it is that  we
     are trying to perceive, and then  we search and analyze data bits according
     to their  significance and  fit to  what we  are attempting to  "perceive."
     Meaning and intention are more significant to perception, in modern theory,
     than light waves and photo-sensitivity.   In other words, the creative  and
     subjective processes in  perception are given more  central prominence, and
     the  physics of  perception  are accorded  more  the status  of  tools than
     primary determinants.    Similarly,  the  philosophy of  science  has  been
     arguing that facts, as such, do not exist; rather theories--in other words,
     intentional approaches  to creating meaning--are what  determine which data
     bits constitute  facts, and determines  whether or not  the data  bits will
     even be noticed.  


                                                                             573

     Perhaps such philosophical abstractions seem  cloudy or irrelevant, but the
     mechanistic,  sensory-based, objective approach  to perception  (whether in
     visual perception or scientific knowing) has been 
     undergoing  radical changes.  Fans  of the transpersonal  dimension of life
     who assume that the eye sees like a camera have an unnecessarily tough time
     trying  to  justify as  scientific  their  views  on  ESP.   Realizing  how
     scientific and  philosophical views on  perception have  evolved makes  ESP
     seem more  natural than supernatural.   Thus  the author's work  does us  a
     great service.  It provides a  readable  treatise on how one can  argue, on
     the basis of both scientific and philosophical grounds, that dreams, not to
     mention  our  lives, are  pregnant  with  meaning (sometimes  transpersonal
     meaning), and deserve our attention.

     How to problem-solve in your dreams
     -----------------------------------

       Your dreams are "written" in your own private vocabulary; that's why
     their meaning is often unclear (and why dream books you buy at the corner
     newsstand won't explain your own visions). Moreover, the language of dreams
     is sensory and visual, whereas the language of daily life is verbal. You
     need to translate a dream much as you would a foreign language.

     Unfortunately, the same force s that make us disguise problems in our
     dreams are likely to hinder our recognizing them when we're awake. Even
     Freud had trouble with self-analysis. So an impartial listener - attained
     therapist - can help. "It's a collaborative process," says New York
     psychoanalyst Walter Bonime, author  of the classic text, THE  CLINICAL USE
     OF DREAMS (Da Capo Press, $29.50)

     But that doesn't mean you shouldn't explore your dreams alone or with a
     partner. People who keep dream journals say that over time, patterns often
     emerge.
       To put your dreams to work solving problems, try this routine:

      o Program yourself to wake up after every REM period. I did it while
           writing this article simply by telling myselfI wanted to at bedtime. 
     But  don't  make  it  a   regular  habit.  "The  ability  to  maintain     
     consciousness  during sleep can backfire," says Dr.  Neil Kavey, director  
     of the Columbia-Presbyterian  sleep lab. "If you can't  shut it off, you   
     may  have trouble remaining asleep,  or you may sleep so  poorly that you  
     feel you didn't sleep at all."

      o Put a notebook and pen or tape recorder at your bedside.

      o At bedtime, select a problem and sum it up with a question, such as
        "Should I take this new job?" Write it down and list possible solutions.

      o Turn off the lights and reflect on these solutions. Stick with it until
        you drift off to sleep.

       o When you wake up - during the night or in the morning - lie still. To  
     jog your memory, pretend you're a detective interviewing an eyewitness.
        What's the last thing you remember? Before that? Going backward can help
        you more easily reconstruct a dream.

      o Write down or tape record all that you remember. Do it before you shower
        and have breakfast.

      o If you have trouble catching dreams, try sleeping late on weekends
        The longest dreams occur in the last part of sleep and many of us cut
        sleep short on week nights.


                                                                             575

     Once you've recorded your dream, how do you decode it? Tell it to yourself
     in the third person, suggest psychologist Lillie Weiss in DREAM ANALYSIS IN
     PSYCHOTHERAPY  (Pergamon Press,  $11.95). This may  give you  some distance
     from the dream  and help you see the actions more clearly. Then look at the
     part  of  the  dream that  is  the  most mysterious.  "Frequently  the most
     incongruous part provides the dream message," Weiss says.

     In her dream-therapy study, Cartwright asks participants to examine and
     try to change repetitive, troublesome dreams along seven dimensions:

      o Time orientation. Do all your dreams take place in the past? Try
        positioning them in the present or future.

       o Competence to affect the outcome. Tryfinding a positive way to resolve 
      a dream.

       o Self-blame.  In your  dreams, do  you hold  yourself responsible   when
     things
        go wrong? Must you?

       o  Relation to former  role: If your  divorced, do you  still dream of   
     yourself  as  married? If  you  have lost  your job,  do  you still  see   
     yourself at work?  Consider alternatives.

      o Motivation. Do you dream of being nurtured? Can you think of a way to
        take care of yourself?

      o Mood. What would make a dream more pleasant?

      o Dream roles: Do you like the part you play in your dreams? What role
        would you prefer?


                                                                             576

     .     This following is  an excerpt from "Psi  Notes", prepared by  William
     Braud, Ph.D., of the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio, Texas.

     Question:   What percentage of a person's dreams are precognitive (foretell
     the future) and how  can we recognize the difference between a precognitive
     dream and an ordinary dream?

     Answer:    A large  proportion  of  precognitive  experiences occur  during
     dreams.   One survey indicates that  as many as 65  percent of precognitive
     experiences  occurred  during sleep.    Precognitive  dreams also  seem  to
     provide  more complete and more accurate information than do waking psychic
     experiences.

     .   There's no way to know with certainty what percentage of our dreams are
     precognitive.  The content of the majority of our dreams is probably quite
     mundane, involving replays of experiences of the day, perhaps some wish
     fulfillment, and maybe  even "random" content.  But now  and then, dreamers
     do have accurate glimpses of the future as they sleep.

     .    The only way to know  with certainty which dreams are precognitive and
     which are not is to keep a dream diary of all dreams and check to see which
     come true  and which  don't.   Some persons are  able to  associate certain
     feelings of confidence  in connection with psychic  dreams - but these  are
     very subtle  feelings which are difficult  to put into words  and which may
     differ from person to person.

     .    Let me describe  a program of  research in which  we are more  certain
     about what's going on.  This research program was initiated by a New York
     psychiatrist, Dr. Montague Ullman, as  a result of his observation that  he
     and  his  patients  were  sharing  telepathic  dreams  in  the  context  of
     psychotherapy.   A dream laboratory was set up at Maimonides Medical Center
     in  Brooklyn.   Ullman,  along with  his  associates Stanley  Krippner  and
     Charles  Honorton, designed experiments in which persons spent the night in
     the dream lab.   They  were monitored electro-physiologically  in order  to
     detect physiological  indications of dreaming -  these indications include:
     an activated EEG, rapid  eye movements, and  reduced muscle tension.   When
     these  indications of dreaming occurred, the sleeper was awakened and asked
     to describe his  dream.   These descriptions were  tape-recorded and  later
     transcribed.  The  next day, a target experience was  randomly selected and
     the  subject then went  through some waking  sensory experience.   What was
     discovered  was that  the sleeper was  able to  have accurate  dreams about
     events of which no one was as yet aware at the time of the dream, but which
     were randomly selected the next day.

                                    FESTIVALS
                                    ---------
           Within  the Pagan  community  there  are  many holidays  and  Sabbats
     celebrated  for various means, and not all celebrate each holiday/Sabbat in
     the same exact way or for the same reasons. The following is a general list
     of the Holidays most common between all the Sects within Neo-Paganisim.


     YULE   (Winter Solstice, December 20-23 (varies according to the particular
             date on the standard calendar according to when the Solstice will
                     occurastronomically)).Longest nightof theyear, theturning  
                point whenthe days shall afterwardsgrow longer as winterbegins  
                   its passageinto thecoming spring.It is,inthe Goddessworship, 
     the time when she gives forth again to the birth of the Divine Sun         
     child who shall be both child and eventually lover and father of           
     the next child in the cycle. Winter Solstice for pagans is a time          
     of feasting and the exchanging of gifts and is the original Holiday        
     that the Christian religions modified into their own Christmas,            
     even upto the birth of the child (Most theologians who have spent          
     time studying the birth of Jesus admit he was born in either March         
     or April, not the celebrated Christmas date we all know from the           
     standard calendar - it was moved to this date to help induce Pagans      to
     give up their old ways yet allow them their holidays during the      spread
     of Christianity thru Europe and the British Isles).                        
     Traditional adornments are a Yule Log, usually of oak, and a               
     combination of mistletoe and holly (also all later plagiarized into        
     Christian ways).

     CANDLEMAS  (Brigid's Day, February  2nd) Not common to  all pagans, this is
     very popular with Wiccans and various Celtic sects. Brigid is the 
     Celtic goddess of fire and inspiration (Poetry, smithcraft and   healing)
     as well as yet another representation of the Fertility of   Femininity  and
     Love.  Brigid had such a strong following among the    Celtics   that   the
     Christian church decided it was easier to assimilate   her  into their  own
     system, and so there came about the making of Saint    Brigit  and all  the
     stories they created about her so that her   followers  would  leave  their
     old beliefs enough so they would not side    with  the   Druids,  who  were
     known at that time as 'the snakes' because   of  their   tendency  to  have
     tamed snakes that were used to help produce  various  healing  mixtures via
     their venom, and who were violently     opposing  the  Catholic church.  In
     History, of 
          course, the druids lost against the overwhelming odds presented by the
          church, led by a man who would then be himself sainted by the church, 
          their Saint Patrick (who was no clergyman but a warrior). Thus 
     Christian rule of various sorts came into Ireland. Handcrafts are     often
     sacrificed to Brigid or dedicated to her as they are started on  this  day.
     Its celebration is done with many candles and as usual much      feasting.
     The Christians also took, moved slightly and used this      d a t e     b y
     creating St. Valentine and using the day for one of chaste  l   o   v   e
     reflections.

     Eostar Ritual (Spring Equinox, March 20-23 dependant on actual astronomical
          event) This is the start in the pagan year of spring, at least among
          Wiccans and Celtics. The first flowers are praised and the Gods and
          Goddesses thanked for the true return to happier times for all. Eostar
               is oneof the more colorful holidays, not one of the somber colors
     found in Yule and Candlemas. Feasting and socializing are the    important
     factors in this holiday as well as the celebration of the   return of color
     to the natural world. In the Christian  calendar,      again to  draw early
     worshipers, they marked this as the final days and     rebirth   of   Jesus
     (when according to history he died in June!)
     Beltane (May Eve, April 30th-May 1st) Most important to pagans, save  f o r
     Samhain, I don't know of any Pagan group that doesn't celebrate  t  h  i  s
     holiday in some way.  Beltane is the  great Fertility rite  of life,       
     starting at dusk on the 30th and continuing until the dawn of the 1st.     
     The union of the God and Goddess to conceive the sun-child to be takes     
     place upon this holiday, no matter which tradition of paganisim is 
          involved. Beltane is the one holiday most discouraged by the 
     Christians, who didn't even use it as a point for a holiday of their  o w n
     because the power and nature of the day involved. Still, even in 
     Christianized Ireland the May day dance of the Maypole remained, as   d i d
     the giving of flowers to those you loved or cared for as friends.     T h e
     Maypole is a symbol of the union of the God and Goddess to create     life,
     the pole itself a phallic symbol while the dancers and their     streamers
     or vines of flowers represent the fertile womb of the goddess    a s    i t
     takes in the Phallus of the god and takes in his seed. Besides   t   h   e
     Maypole often a bonfire is present, and members of the group are 
     encouraged to jump the flames for luck and their own fertility. Food, drink
     and love are the order of the evening. In most sects the    celebration  of
     Beltane will become one large orgy as the participants      are  encouraged
     to enact their own unions of love. Beltane is the time      o f     m a n y
     marriages/handfastings in the pagan community (in some it is     the  point
     where one chooses to begin and end relationships of a  physical    nature).
     Clothing is very optional in most get togethers on     this   holiday,  and
     mostly it is sensual and colorful. Even those sects    that   are   prudish
     about things tend to accept the rules of the holiday,  as it is the holiday
     of free love. It is said that a child conceived   on this day will  grow up
     to wield great power and knowledge and to be      healthier  than upon  any
     other.
     Litha (Summer Solstice, June 20-23, dependant on actual astronomical event)
          Held on the longest day of the year, the Solstice is the celebration 
          of lights triumph over darkness and that of the bountiful beauty that
          light brings into life. Flowers are common in the circle, roses and
               brightcheerful wildflowers are upon the altar and usually worn by
     all.   It is  the changing point  of the  year, and the  celebration of the
     spiral dance of the year is common among Wiccans. It a celebration    with
     much joy, and much feasting. Many wiccans will attire themselves      i   n
     bright colors and equally bright adornments of flowers. Litha'   usual food
     fare may include honeycakes or cornbread. Litha is not      celebrated   by
     all sects nor in the same way.

     Lughnasad (August 1st)  The great corn ritual  of Wiccan belief (in  Celtic
     realms this is the celebration of the wheat god, corn is an 
     Americanization and it is possible there is an American Indian 
     traditional holiday near this date that was borrowed by the American 
     Neopagans). THis is the big celebration of the harvest (Sort of a     Pagan
     Thanksgiving, but the time clock is different as is that of the  Celtics).
     Much feasting and dancing occur, thou it is a bit more      somber     than
     many of the other holidays.  Some Pagans celebrate this     day  as  merely
     the day to bake their bread and cakes for the coming   winter  and  do   no
     actual rituals save that of blessing the foods    prepared.
     Mabon (Fall Equinox, Sept. 20-23, dependant on actual astronomical event)
          A lesser holiday, this is not widely celebrated and is most come with
          Pure wiccan groups, especially those who are based in the works of 
          Starhawk and other Dianic sects. This is the weavers festival, and a
          braiding of cords are done in the process of casting a spell to
          add to ones life from what it is, each person weaving unto themselves
          what they wish and the coven as a whole weaving all the cords together
          to unite the power and efforts symbolically.
     SAMHAIN  (Halloween Oct 31st) THe year ends traditionally in Wiccan beliefs
          with  this holiday. Samhain is said to be  the period of time when the
     gates between the worlds are least guarded and the veils their   thinnest.
     It is a time for dimensional openings and workings, and     a l s o   t h e
     celebration of the death of the year king. It is a somber   holiday, one of
     dark clothes and thoughts for the dead, it is said to  be  the  time   when
     those of necromantic talents can speak with the dead   and it is certainly
     a time to remember ones dead. It is a time of     endings  of relationships
     and bad situations and it is the time when   one  can  see  the glimmer  of
     hope in the future. THere are as many   concepts  attached to  this holiday
     as any other.

                           THE HOLY FOOL: 
                     The Third member of the Triad 
                      -some musings by: the Bard 
      
                                   * 
      
     "Remember, the Moon is only half as big as the Earth, but it's twice as 
      far away." 
                                                                  -Anonymous 
                                   * 
      
             After some time musing on the concept of Goddess/God that is  
       common in Wiccan (and most Neo-Pagan groups) and seeing the common  theme
     of "things come in threes" in these belief systems, I fell to wondering  
     "Why only the God and Goddess? If all things come in threes, where is  
     the Third Aspect that should be there?"  

             So what is this Third Aspect? I feel it is the Holy Fool; the  
     Prometheus who is the Trickster, the God (neuter) that rolls the dice. 
     This also fills in certain holes  in neo-Pagan Theology that have  bothered
     me for some time, too.  

             First, we need to have a quick look at the Holy Fool in religious 
     and/or cultural beliefs, both primitive and modern:  
      
           American Indian: 
                    Aztec: Ueuecoyotl 
                    Caddo: Coyote 
                    Chinook: Coyote 
                    Coos: Coyote 
                    Haida: Raven 
                    Hopi: Mudhead Kachina, Clown Kachina 
                    Kiowa: Coyote 
                    Navaho: Coyote 
                    Nez Perce: Coyote 
                    Omaha: Coyote, Rabbit, Iktinike, Orphan 
                    Pueblo: Koshare 
                    Sioux: Spider 
                    Tillamook: Coyote 
                    Tinglit: Raven 
                    Winnebago: Rabbit         
                    Zuni: Coyote 
           African: Spider, Tortoise, Rabbit, Jackal 
           Graeco/Roman: Pan, Dionysis 
           Celtic: Phooka and the like (see Irish: Fear Dearg, and a host of 
                   others. The Fool must love Ireland very much...He made so 
                   many of Itself there!) 
           Norse: Loki...-and- Balder 
           Banks Island: Clat 
           Micronesia: Nareau 
           England: Puck, Black Jack Davy 
           Christianity: "Doubting" Thomas, and The Christ Himself, in many 
                         ways....and Judas, too. 
           20th Cent. North American: Bugs Bunny, The Joker, Mr. Mxyzpltk,  
                                      Murphy, ("And Pooh is a -good- example, 
                                      too!" said Eeyore) 


                                                                             592

           Neo-Paganism: Discordians 
           18th thru 20th Cent. Appalachian: Jack (from British Isles) 
           18th and 19th Cent. N.A. Black: Br'er Rabbit, Long John, &c. 
           German: Tyl Eulenspiegel 
           Italy: Harlequin (check out Agatha Christie's stories about 
                  "Harley Quinn." VERY interesting!) 
           Islamic: Juha, Abu Nawwas, Mullah Nasruddin, Nasreddin Khoja, 
                    Nasreddin Hodja 
           Japanese: Fox, Hotei, and the whole concept of Zen...... 
      
             And the many, many instances of the Hero figure and his Friend in  
     most people's mythology....Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Robin Hood and Little 
     John, the Mythic Hollywood Western Hero and his ridiculous sidekick, Don
     Quixote and Sancho Panza.....and many times you see the recurrent theme of
     the Great Betrayal of the Hero, which leads to His death...and to His
     Resurrection! 

             One immediately sees that the Fool is a universal constant in  
     folk belief, just as the Goddess and God are!  
             (NB: I have not gotten more specific for two reasons: one, for  
     limitations of space, and two, to encourage others to do a little reading 
     on their own!)  

             As most things, the Fool is Personified in three basic Aspects  
     that (of course) overlap with each other and with the God and Goddess.  
     The first is that of the Saviour God, the Prometheus, the Culture Hero, who
     brings Knowledge (and  -occasionally- Wisdom) to Mankind. This Aspect loves
     Mankind  with all  His Being,  and only  wishes Good.  His Good  Intentions
     sometimes fall short of His (or Mankind's) expectations,  however.
      
                     Thesecond isthat ofthe Clown,the Nerd,the Jerk,that teaches
     by his own mistakes (and who usually comes out ahead because of His own 
     Innocence.) This Aspect is mostly neutral, and is how He seems to mostly 
     manifest Himself.  

                     Butletus notforget thethird,and darker,side oftheFool, best
     exemplified by  Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker in the film version
     of "Batman." Just as the Goddess has Her Dark side (the Crone,  the
     Morrigan, &c)  and the God  has His (Odin as  Death-God) so does  the  Fool
     have a terrifying Aspect (at least, from the human point of view): Chaos
     Personified.  
      
             This is not an Aspect to invoke, as It does not care. Period. It  
       is the ultimate  psychopath, the ultimate Spoiled Brat,  the quintessence
     of Ego-centric self-love. In some circles, it could be quite nicely named 
     Ahriman, or Shaitan, or Satan, because it fits all concepts of that 
     Middle-Eastern deity....except one: It does not care if Man worships It  or
     not. It is not in  -conflict- with the God and/or Goddess, It is  -not-  on
     the kind of power-trip  that the Judeo-Christian Satan  is represented   as
     having, it just -is-. It should be considered as neither "good" nor  
     "evil," though it can personify both or either....or neither! This is  
     confusing, but with a little thought the concept will (hopefully) come 
     clear.

          (And, just in passing, the film  version of "Batman" is perhaps a very
     good  metaphor  for the  eternal  struggle  between the  Fool-as-Prometheus
     (Batman) and the Fool-as-Chaos (the Joker). 

               Areyou confused? If youare, GOOD! If you arenot, keep thinking by
     not-thinking. (wha-a-a-a-a-t?) 

               Some of thebest examples ofthe three Personifications arefound in
     the Navaho and Zuni tales of Coyote, or the Br'er Rabbit tales, or the 
     older Bugs Bunny cartoons, or even Walt Disney's Goofy. And, while speaking
     of classic animation, if you can see  any of the cartoons of the   Cannibal
     Boy and the  Mynah Bird,  do so!  It shows  not one,  but TWO  Aspects   in
     action!  

          For a look at His more serious (?) side, try J.R.R. Tolkien's 
     wonderful evocation of Tom Bombadil.....who is described as "the oldest."
     Prof. Tolkien came very close to the core of the truth with that one! 

          The Fool is your slightly daffy Uncle, that comes to visit at  
       Christmas and is  such fun to  be with, but who  seems to have  a sadness
     about  him too, that you found  out later, when you were  all grown up, was
     his slide  into alcoholism. The  Fool is  the American sit-com  "Daddy" who
     never seems to  get anything  right, but wins  out in  the end anyway.  The
     Fool is  the classic  scene of  Bugs Bunny,  floating in  a washtub in  the
     middle of the Pacific Ocean, happily singing "As Time Goes By,"  blissfully
     uncaring about his obvious predicament...one which would send  a human into
     sheer despair....knowing that something  will turn up, some   scam that  he
     can pull that  will get him out of the washtub  and into  clover again. The
     Fool is the Tarot's Fool, of course....but He is also the Hanged Man. 
      
          Do -not- invoke the  Fool unless you are ready  for literally ANYTHING
     to happen! He just  might turn you into a Large Green Frog just  to observe
     what happens......He is capricious. He is unpredictable. He is  what He is,
     and  nothing you can do will turn Him  from His Purpose,  whatever that may
     be at any given moment. He is "Murphy," and whatever  can go wrong, WILL
     go  wrong...or  right. Unless  you have  an  uncommonly flexible  mind, you
     -might- not be able to handle it! 

          He has no Festival, unless it is the Lupercal, or perhaps April Fool's
     Day,  or even New Year's  Eve, for every  day is His, as  He chooses.  Some
     have   inquired   about  the   seeming   overlap   of  functions   in   the
     Goddess/God/Fool triad, and this should be addressed here. The modern 
     Western  mind tends  to  "pigeonhole" things,  and  rigidly excludes  other
     things
     from these pigeonholes. This, I feel, is in some ways an error in thinking,
     especially about the Triad.

          One cannot and should not "compartmentalize" the God/Fool/Goddess  
     into three rigidly separate Beings, but rather think of them as three 
     separate sources of ripples in the same Pond: the ripples interact and 
     intersect,  and  act  on  each other,  but  move  within  the same  Source,
     whatever
     That may be.

                    PSYCHIC SELF-DEFENSE                     by =Carlin=
     
          One of the problems which faces the aspiring witch  or magician is
     an increased sensitivity to and awareness of the "unseen" forces of the
     world.   Usually  this sensitivity  is a  delight, but  occasionally it
     becomes a  nightmare --  in the  most literal sense  of the  word.   In
     particular,  this article  deals  with what  spiritualists and  shamans
     would  refer to as  spirit obsession  -- a  cluster of  "symptoms" that
     differ from possession, but that still can destroy the integrity of the
     victims <AND ALSO>  gives some background information on obsession, and
     then  outlines  a few  "generic"  techniques  that will  benefit  those
     subject to this form of "psychic harassment."

                       DEFINING OBSESSION

          Obsession occurs in  every nation and  subculture,and as a  result
     every  magical subculture has had it's own  way of defining and dealing
     with  the phenomena involved.   Modern medicine, with  the exception of
     Jungian and "New Age" psychiatry/psychology, tends to dismiss obsession
     as  either hysteria or budding schizophrenia.  The major religions, for
     the  most part, now  agree with this  evaluation.  Of  course, the "New
     Right"  fundamentalists are likely to  see a demon  in every corner....
     Either  of these approaches tends to disempower the afflicted person by
     destroying  her/his trust  in his  own inner  processes and  making him
     dependent on the "expert" who will control the attempt to cure him/her.
     Spiritualists  will  warn you  against  psychic  attack or  unprotected
     dealings with the  Dead.   Work  <?> will tell you that  the problem is
     either openness to astral influences or rebellion within the psyche <OR
     "ALL OF  THE ABOVE">.  There is more to  being human than the conscious
     mind, and  unintegrated and unrecognized "complexes"  within the psyche
     will  sometimes have  separate agendas  that can  lead to  "attack from
     within" if  those needs  are continually  ignored.     My own  tendency
     <PERHAPS  "BIAS"  OR "APPROACH"  IS A BETTER  WORD> is  philosophically
     Jungian-to-agnostic,but  practically   Shamanic.     I  tend   to  view
     such"entities" as  psychological.  However,  the techniques  I use  are
     more effective if the problem is "projected" outward and  treated as if
     it were the  result of attack by a sentient being.   Even if obsessions
     are  caused by "complexes", a  truly well established  complex takes on
     enough  "life" to be regarded as a "secondary personality" demanding of
     respect.  If someone is having to live with obsession, chances are that
     the  person is more interested  in resolving the  problem than debating
     metaphysics.   The  methodology  outlined below  is  designed to  work,
     whether  you  agree  with the  philosophy  behind  it  or not.    These
     techniques  are "homeopathic"  in  nature, contrived  with the  idea of
     strengthening the victIm's  "psychic immune system" to the  point where
     s/he no longer can be victimized. Without this increase in inner power,
     the person can  be temporarily  freed from the  obsession, but  remains
     vulnerable to "evil influence" in the future.

                                                                         596

                   THE BEGINNINGS OF OBSESSION

          Checking a person's personal history,  one will usually find  that
     obsessions  begin during  periods  where  stress,negative emotions,  or
     injury have  impaired that person's  natural self-protective abilities.
     Or  where  the  person   has  been  unprepared  or  confused   and  has
     intentionally or unintentionally "dropped his/her guard" around someone
     already  disturbed.  Or  where the person has  been abused and degraded
     since  early childhood and is consequently continually open to negative
     influences<LAST   THREE   SENTENCES   NEED   TO   BE  "SMOOTHER">.   In
     psychological terminology, old "complexes" are cathected during periods
     when the ego is  foundered in depression, weakening the  "auric shield"
     that normally will protect against "outside influences," as well as the
     physical body.  This auric shield can also be "pierced" during "psychic
     attacks," leaving a "hole"  through which invading astral-organisms can
     pass freely. In the same way, "evil spirits" are contagious. Emotional,
     sexual, or magical intimacy with someone already obsessed can allow the
     entity  to  pass over  to oneself.  And an  extreme  period of  rage or
     vengefulness can attract like to like, bringing one to the attention of
     "vengeful creatures" in the "lower astral."

                      SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION

          Among the most common symptoms of obsession is a brooding fixation
     upon some negative thought or act.  The obsessed person being unable to
     "turn  off"  the voice  that urges  her/him  on to  self-destructive or
     vindictive acts. The idea that one is the Messiah or the rightful ruler
     of the universe, or too low to continue to live  may repeatedly intrude
     upon  consciousness.   To consider  much addictive  behavior to  be the
     result  of obsession by  "earth-bound spirits" or  elementals<???>.  No
     longer having physical bodies,  the "astral low-lifes" push susceptible
     living  humans into  overindulging  in whatever  the discarnate  entity
     still craves.    In other cases, the symptoms take  other forms.  Sleep
     can  be disrupted  by  repeated  nightmares  or  night  terrors.    The
     individual may awaken with no memory  of the contents of the dream, but
     over time  will develop insomnia  or a  fear of sleep.   Especially  in
     children,the shadows  of night  can resolve themselves  into terrifying
     images,  and there  can be  an overwhelming  sense of  being constantly
     watched.    Visual  "hallucinations"  may  force  themselves  onto  the
     physical plane or may manifest themselves solely upon the "mind's eye."
     At  times the obsession can be relatively benign. Budding magicians can
     "pick  up  hitchhikers"  during   their  initial  workings,  and  these
     "creatures" may well content themselves with acting as Guardians of its
     cases the  "entities" will only  "act out"when  the magician  re-enters
     trance or attempts to work  on the astral levels<PATCH IT UP>.   People
     who  work  with  divinatory  techniques  without  proper  training  and
     grounding are  especially vulnerable,  with the  Ouija board  being the
     worst offender.   This is  one reason that  the traditional  religions,
     which  do   not  want   the   general  populace   trained  in   magical
     techniques,urge people away from divinatory practices.  Obsessions that
     strike those  not trained to magick  are usually not so  courteous.  In
     the  more entrenched  cases,physical symptoms  other than  insomnia can
     manifest.  Especially  when one  is very  tired  or ill,  the obsession
     attempt  can escalate and begin to unbalance the homeostatic mechanisms
     of the  body.   Constipation,sinusitis and  migraine headaches are  the
     more usual manifestations, along with extreme pallor, edema, and mental
     confusion and  memory  loss.   Poltergeist activity  is also  sometimes
     reported.The obsessing entity can also color the impressions of others.

                                                                         597

     One  can suddenly find oneself  being accused of  unsavory attitudes or
     persistently  misunderstood.     At  the  same   time,  truly  unsavory
     characters will be attracted to the new image and will begin to  pop up
     out of the woodwork.

                     THE MAGICAL APPROACH

          There are  many  things that  one  can  do if  one  suspects  that
     obsession  has occurred.   One  can treat  it as  a  demon and  turn to
     spiritual  authority for help.  One can  treat it as mental illness and
     turn  to  psychiatric explanations.    One  can ignore  it  as much  as
     possible, or begin to avoid the activities that call it forth.  One can
     also "raise one's  energies" using self-help  techniques such as  those
     outlined  in  following  paragraphs.Any  one  of  the  above  reactions
     cripples one as a magician, however.  From a ceremonial viewpoint,  one
     must pass the "Guardian on the Threshold" before one can pass on to the
     next  level of development.From a Jungian  standpoint, one must develop
     rapport  with and "reintegrate"  the rejected portion;  from a Shamanic
     standpoint, one must "turn" the entity and either dismiss it or convert
     it into a spirit helper<?>.

       THE INNER DIALOGUE

          Step one, using the magical approach, is to become acquainted with
     the "entity" and  engage it  in dialogue.In some  instances the  entity
     will turn out to be malevolent, in other's only "immature" or  confused
     and angry at being ignored.   Before engaging in this activity,  one is
     advised to ground and  center, and to shield  in whatever manner  one's
     tradition suggests. One  is also advised to  begin/continue in whatever
     other  spiritually protective exercises  one has  faith in.If  there is
     someone available to work  with the afflicted person, have  that helper
     prepare a  list of non-leading(Not  "are you a  demon?," but "what  are
     you?") questions.  Then drop  into light trance and Then let  the other
     person ask the questions while the  victim answers with the first thing
     that  pops  into his/her  head.   In effect,  s/he will  be voluntarily
     "channelling"  for  the  entity's  unconscious   and  perhaps  "denied"
     (officially) circumstances.If there is no other person, then the victim
     must  do whatever  form  of  divination  or  trance  work  he/she  have
     developed  to   contact  his/her   subconscious.    Those   with  vivid
     imaginations can simply  find a quiet moment and ask  "are you there?,"
     personifying  the  "entity"  in  the  same  way  that  children  create
     imaginary  friends.  Afterwards, no matter what the technique used, the
     obsessed  person is to be certain that  his/her aura is closed and that
     s/he is grounded and centered. AFTER  "CONTACT" At this point s/he  may
     have failed to  make contact.In which case there is  nothing to him/her
     to do but repeat the exercise until either it works or s/he is  sure it
     isn't  going to work.  If real contact  does not occur, then s/he might
     attempt to simply banish "it".  It is possible that the entity will not
     answer directly, but will  begin to up<INCREASE> its activity  level or
     bring a  string of  unusual circumstances  into  the obsessed  person's
     life.

                                                                         598

               It is  more likely,  however, the<Y>  have begun a  dialogue.
     Sometimes "complexes"are  immature parts of our  own personalities that
     will calm  down and begin  to behave themselves  once "they"  no longer
     feel  that they are being ignored.If the  obsessing image is that of an
     animal, or even an ugly humanoid  being, then it may simply be  time to
     intensify one's spiritual  quest and  face down one's  power animal  or
     dark side.  Frequently, these allies will attempt to come to the aid of
     someone  undergoing   psychic  attack,  and  because   of  the  general
     atmosphere of  fear,will  be  perceived  as  threats  and  turned  away
     themselves.Eventually,   in  either  case   the  "entity"   can  either
     be"reintegrated" into the personality, or  "kept" as a spirit-helper by
     those with shamanic leanings.  If one is ALSO under psychic attack, the
     ally  will probably  help  in  the  defense  once  asked  and  properly
     recognized.

                             "LOST SOULS" AND WORSE 

          On the other hand, "it" may  claim to be a spirit or  other entity
     that  requires help.   If the request  is not  ridiculous <d>o consider
     honoring it. The author  has personally dealt with a  "poltergeist" who
     claimed to be a woman who had died of yellow fever  over a century ago.
     When questioned, the "spirit" was confused at first, then admitted that
     she had died in delirium  and had not realized that she  was dead until
     "awakened" out  of her stupor by some young people using a Ouija board.
     When  asked what  she  wanted,  the  reply  was "Pray  for  me."    The
     poltergeist activity ended as soon as prayers were begun, and the  last
     message received  from the spirit was "Thank God, I'm free."  Not being
     able to  make herself  understood on  the material  plane by any  other
     means, the "spirit" had resorted to knocking physical objects around to
     attract  attention.  If someone of "mediumistic" nature had been about,
     she  might have  obsessed  that  person  instead in  her  bid  to  gain
     attention.   The  obsession would  have become  malevolent only  if the
     obsessed person repeatedly blocked  her out or otherwise caused  her to
     <?>become cases  of obsession  in relatively "normal"persons  will fall
     into one of  the first few categories.In  rare cases, the obsessed  may
     have had  his/her attempt at  contact met with a  voice screaming "DIE,
     DIE, DIE."   Or  something  similar and  profane.   This  is where  the
     spiritual practices  suggested in the  following paragraphs will  be of
     greatest  benefit, followed by  professional help or  even exorcism, if
     necessary.   (Even  where  an  entity  seems  totally  hostile,  it  is
     sometimes  possible to  "turn" it  through raising  "light"as described
     below.)

                                                                         599

                    SELF-HELP WITH OBSESSION

          Not everyone  is a magician  and not everyone  wishes to  open the
     "can of worms"  of the subconscious.The  following activities are  very
     useful  in "uprooting"spiritual  obsession by  increasing "light".   In
     cases of  "mild" obsession  only a  few of  these measures,or a  simple
     ritual of  dismissal, will be  sufficient to  be rid of  the problem.In
     more entrenched  cases, these techniques  should be  continued for  the
     healing period, accompanied  by Inner Work, depth psychology,  or other
     techniques  that  promote  self-understanding.    Those suffering  from
     physical symptoms  should also work  to strengthen their  immune system
     and  improve their  diet  and lifestyle.    If possible,  the  severely
     afflicted  individual  should have  a  counselor,  teacher, or  trusted
     friend monitor his/her progress "just in case."

                       EXAMPLE TECHNIQUES FOR "RAISING THE LIGHT"

          For  a  period of  three months,  the  obsessed   should "cleanse"
     him/herself  daily  in  whatever  manner  her/his  spiritual  tradition
     decrees.   Grounding  and  centering are  excellent  techniques, as  is
     renewing oneself through visualizing the aura as  strong and untainted.
     One can draw  pictures of oneself expelling all darkness or meditate on
     the  same image.Prayer is useful,  as is catching  oneself thinking the
     old negative thoughts and declaring that one has "taken that out of the
     Law"  or "averted" the consequences.   If the afflicted has friends who
     engage in spiritual pursuits, send him/her mental support  and positive
     energy.   The individual is also advised to spend time in sacred places
     where evil is barred from entering, and to refrain from  the company of
     persons s/he knows  are bad  for her/him.If already  attuned to  ritual
     work,  the  victim can"cleanse"  his/her home  or  have it  cleansed by
     someone trusted.   Those who have  faith in Holy Water  should sprinkle
     and apply it liberally.   Afterwards, if the obsessed  is truly serious
     about being rid of a persistent  fixation, s/he can burn white  candles
     constantly  while awake  and at home.   This  will act  as a  symbol of
     the"light" one wishes  to draw  into one's  life.   The most  seriously
     affected  are advised to surround  their beds with  a protective circle
     and  never to  sleep in  a darkened  room.   Other religious/protective
     symbols can be placed in sight and called upon, and protective incenses
     such as sandalwood may be burned.  The important thing is to keep one's
     spiritual goal constantly in mind and the"entity<?> one's determination
     to improve. This may  seem like a great deal of  effort, but the effect
     will be  to "open" the individual to  positive influences, even if s/he
     doesn't  believe in  "demons".The individual  will be  "raising his/her
     energy" level to the point where  something "dark" cannot even bear  to
     approach her/him, and keeping the energy "high"for a long enough period
     that "it" will become  "discouraged" and fade from sight.At the  end of
     the  three months, the "entity" should either be weakened severely from
     being "starved" or  should be gone.   If  it is gone,  then a  ritually
     adept person can  do a  rededication wherein the  formerly obsessed  is
     declared sealed  against recurrences. If the problem still exists, then
     the  cause  may actually  be  mental  illness  brought  on by  a  brain
     imbalance or early trauma.  In any case, entrenchment of that degree of

                             DIANISM IN A NUIT-SHELL 

               Recently, I got back in touch with my teacherafter nearly two
     years and dropped a  couple of bombshells on her:  I had changed gender
     identity and  had come together with  two other women to  form a Dianic
     coven.  When the initial shock wore off, Rita sent me a complete run of
     Protean Synthesis and a solicitation for this article.

               Several yearsago I subscribed toseveral stereotypes regarding
     "those  peculiar Dianics".   They  were thealogically  unbalanced, they
     hated men, they denied that men had souls, they were all lesbians, they
     couldn't  spell  (in the  orthographic sense;  no  one has  yet accused
     Dianics  of inability to work magick), etc.  etc.  When I came together
     with  my covensisters,  I  realized that  these  notions were  at  most
     partially true and some cases were patently false.

               Ibelieve there are onlythree valid generalizationsthat can be
     made about Dianics:   1) We are all feminists.   2) We all look  to the
     Goddess(es)  far more  than to the  God(s).   3) We  are all eclectics.
     Note  well  that  there  are plenty  of  non-Dianic  feminist  Witches,
     non-Dianic   eclectics,    and    non-Dianics   who    are    primarily
     Goddess-oriented.    There are  also  doubtless a  good  many feminist,
     Goddess-oriented eclectics who do not choose to call themselves
     Dianic.   In  my own  case I  use the  "If it  quacks  like a  duck, it
     probably is  a duck" argument, as well as  the fact that my HPS learned
     the Craft as a Dianic and runs Dianic rituals.

               Some of thestereotypical generalizations I can dismiss out of
     hand.   I don't know of a single Dianic who denies that men have souls.
     Even  Z Budapest doesn't  believe that piece  of tripe anymore!   It is
     true that  Dianism is particularly attractive to  separatists, and many
     separatists  actually hate  men.   Many  Dianics  are lesbians.    Some
     misspell words  like "woman", women", "egalitarian",  and "holistic" on
     purpose.   Not all fit these, however,  and I think that  Z Budapest in
     her younger, or spiritual bomb-throwing, days represents an extreme and
     a small minority.  There are a number of males involved in Dianism, and
     some of those are men [NB:  I use the terms "man" and
     "woman"  to indicate gender identity,  that is, how  one's heart, mind,
     and/or soul  are configured.   I  use "male"  and "female" to  indicate
     physical  sex, that is, how one's plumbing  is configured.  I hope this
     dispels confusion.].

               Thealogical and magickalimbalance isnot soeasily dismissedand
     needs to be addressed further, as that is the most valid objection that
     thoughtful  Witches have to Dianism.  The apparent imbalance comes from
     the Dianic emphasis on Goddess-worship, often to the complete exclusion
     of God-worship.  This  upsets many Witches' sense of  polarity balance.
     The  resolution of this apparent imbalance lies in the consideration of
     other  polarities than  sexual and/or gender  as the  primary polarity.
     There  are  indeed  many other  polarities  to  consider:   true-false,
     life-death,   dark-light,    rational-mystical,   creation-destruction,
     order-chaos, and good-evil, to name but a few.
     One problem with  the masculine-feminine  polarity is that  there is  a
     strong tendency  to express all other  polarities in terms of  it.  The
     Chinese  were particularly  fond of  this, and  mapped  everything they
     liked into the  yang side, and everything they disliked  or feared into
     the yin side, the patriarchal no-accounts!
