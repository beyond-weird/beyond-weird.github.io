                                     Descent Of The Goddess
                                Copyright 1993 Durwydd Mac Tara

                     (With special thanks to G. B. Gardner, Freydis Vasa,
                      Julia Phillips, and Pyrocanthus Basileus)

                  In ancient times, our Lord,the Horned One, was (as hestill is)
          the
          Controller, the Comforter.  But men know him as the dread Lord of
          Shadows, lonely, stern, and just.

              But our Lady the Goddess oft grieved deeply for the fate of her
          creations as they  aged and died. She would solve  all mysteries, even
          the
          mystery of death, and so journeyed to the underworld.

                  The Guardian of  the Portals  challenged her:  'Strip off  thy
          garments,
          lay aside thy jewels; for naught may you bring with you into this
          our land, for it is written that your True Self is the only fitting
          adornment for those in the realms of Death.'

                  So she laid down her garments and her jewels, andwas bound, as
          all
          living must be who seek to enter the realms of Death, the Mighty One.

                  Such was herbeauty that Death himself knelt,and laid his sword
          and
          crown at her feet, and kissed her feet, saying: 'Blessed be thy feet
          that have brought thee in these ways.  Abide with me; but let me place
          my cold hand on thy heart.'

              And she replied: 'Why do you cause all things that I love, and
          take delight in, to fade and die?'

              'Lady,' replied Death, 'it is age and fate, against which I am
          helpless.  Age causes  all things to wither;  but when men die  at the
          end
          of time, I give them rest and peace and strength, so that they may
          return.  But you, you are lovely.  Return not, abide with me.'

                    And she replied, 'Nay, I love theenot and I am needed in the
          world
          of the living.'

               Again Death knelt, and kissed her knees, saying: 'Blessed be thy
          knees that  kneel before the  Altar.  Abide with  me; let me  place my
          cold
          hand on thy heart.'

                    And she replied, 'Nay, I love thee not and I am needed inthe
          world
          of the living.'

               Death (still kneeling), kissed her on the womb, saying:
          'Blessed be thy organs of generation,  without which none of us  would
          be. 
          Abide with me; let me place my cold hand on thy heart.'

               And she replied, 'Nay though I feel the beginnings of love for

                                           1923
          


          thee, I must return to those I fully love in the world of creation.'

                    Deaththen stood, and kissedher on thebreast, saying: Blessed
          be
          thy  breast, formed  in strength and  beauty.   Abide with  me; let me
          place
          my cold hand on thy heart.'

               And she replied, 'Nay though I feel love for thee, I must not
          abandon those I am responsible for, in the world of creation. I cannot
          do this thing, better you would return with me.'

               'Lady,' replied Death, It cannot be so.  If I were to leave my
          realm, and abandon those who seek their comfort and rest with me, then
          the Wheel would no longer turn.  Age and weakness would overtake those
          whom you  love, and they would  have nowhere to find  rest, and peace,
          and
          reunion with those who have gone before.  As age and debility overtook
          your creations, there would quickly be no room for the new, only the
          withered,  the  tired, and  the stagnant.'  He  then kissed  her lips,
          saying:
          'Blessed be  thy lips, which shall  utter the Holy Names.   Abide with
          me;
          let me place my cold hand on thy heart.'

                    And shereplied, Let us BOTHlay our hands, eachunto the heart
          of
          the other, thereby claiming and uniting each unto the other.  In this
          way may I rule my kingdom of birth, creation, and life; yet share with
          you your kingdom of death, rejuvenation, and rest. United in Perfect
          Love and Perfect Trust, that the Universe may be whole and the Wheel
          turn smoothly.

               Death replied, 'This is indeed WISDOM, So Mote it Be!' They
          embraced, thus pledging their eternal love. 

                  And he taught her all his mysteries, and gave her the necklace
          which
          is the  circle of  rebirth.   And she  taught him  her mystery of  the
          sacred
          cup which is the cauldron of rebirth.

                  They loved, and were one; for there be three greatmysteries in
          the
          life of  mankind, and magic  controls them all.   To fulfil  love, you
          must
          return again at the same time and at the same place as the loved ones;
          and you must meet, and know, and remember, and love them again.

              But to be reborn, you must die, and be made ready for a new body.
          And to die, you must be born; and without love, you may not be born.

                  And our Goddess is ever inclined to love,and mirth, and happi-
          ness;
          and guards and cherishes her hidden children in life, and in death
          she teaches the way to her communion; and even in this world she
          teaches them the mystery of the Magic Circle, which is placed between
          the worlds of men and of the Gods.

          And thus we are taught of the beginnings of the wheel of the year

                                           1924
          


          wherein the Lord and the Lady share their rulership of the year, each
          offering and sharing  a balance to  the other, and  the basis of  that
          sharing.

                                (c) 1986, Kyri Comyn

               "I am the strength of the rock at thy back, the roots of the
          tree that anchor the Earth and deepest of tides in the black
          depths of the ocean.  I am the Hunter and the Sacred Prey, the
          warmth of the sun in the swelling grapes and the call of the road
          that leads over the hill.

               I give you, my creatures, the fire of love, the power of the
          wind on your face, shelter from the darkest storm.  You are dear
          to me, and I instill in you my power...the power of peace hard
          earned, the power of vision and magical sight, and the spark of
          elemental fire, which is the primal light in the darkness.

               By the powers of running stag and glorious sun, I charge
          thee;  by the darkest depth of night and the lingering tendrils
          of dreams, I charge thee; and by the beauty of your own creation,
          I charge thee;

               Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead
               you.  The wealth of the heart will guide you where the
               cold edge of logic cannot take you.

               Take joy in the powers of your bodies.  The form your
               body takes is unique in the universe and is chief among
               your tools.

               Lastly, always remember the path you have left behind
               you.  Learn to take your power from the foolish things
               you have wrought as well as the good you have done for
               others and for your world.  You can never usurp
               another's power, and yours is the well upon which you
               must rely.

               I am with you always, just over your shoulder, running with
          you through the tall grasses and forests that surround you.  I
          possess you and I am your Sacred Prey.  I am the Lord of Death,
          and when you have come to the end of your life on this world, I
          will be there; to take you between the worlds, to offer you peace
          and rest.  Look upon my face; know me.  I am the spirit of the
          wild things, but you too, are wild in your souls and we are
          forever intertwined."

               "I am the quickening of the seed in Springtime, the glory of
          ripe fields in Summer, and the peace of the quiet woods as the
          snow calms the Earth in Winter.  I am the lilt of the maidens'
          melody in the morning, the patient hand of the Mother and the
          deep river of the mysteries taught by moonlight.

               I give the creatures of the earth the gifts of song rising
          from the heart, the joy of autumn sunset, the cool touch of the
          renewing waters, and the compelling call of the drum in the
          dance.  To you I give the joy of creation and the companion of
          beauty to light your days.

               By the powers of the steadfast Earth and the wheeling stars
          I charge thee; by the darkness of death and the white light of
          birth I charge thee; and by the terrible strength of your human
          spirits, I charge thee:

               Strive always for the growth of your eternal soul,
               never intentionally diminish your strength, your
               compassion, your ties to the earth or your knowledge.

               Challenge your mind, never accept complacently that
               which has been the standard merely for the reason that
               it is the standard by which the majority judges itself.

               Thirdly, I charge thee, act always for the betterment
               of your brothers and sisters.  To strengthen them is to
               forge the true chain of humanity, and a chain is only
               as strong as its weakest link.

               You are my children, my brothers and sisters and my
          companions.  You are known in great part by the company you keep,
          and you are strong and wise and full of the powers of life.  It
          is yours to use them in my service, and I also, am known by the
          company I keep.

               Go forth in joy and the light of my love, turning to me
          without fear when the darkness threatens to overcome you, and
          turning also to me to share your triumphs and your achievements,
          and know in your heart of hearts that we are together in blood
          and spirit 'til the last star darkens in the sky and winter comes
          to the universe."

          Hark unto me: for I am  He who has existed throughout all time.  I was
          there from the beginning; it was my potency that charged the fertility
          of the Great Mother and created life from her empty womb.

          the bull  that engenders life upon  the cow; the strength  of the boar
          that engenders life upon the sacred sow of Ceriddwen; the speed of the
          stag running free in the  forest that no hunter can bring down save he
          who speaks the  sacred words to  call unto the  spirit of the  fleeing
          stag.

                          I am Lord of theDance; he who swirls throughthe starry
          universe  with the world at his heels.  I am he who dances on mountain
          and plain and hearth, and he who captures all things in his dance.

          I am the harmonious tune of the songbird
          And the laughter of a gleeful child.
          I am the bubbling sound of the running brook
          And the scent of the flowers wild.

          I am the floating leaf upon the breeze

          And the rapture of passion when love is made.

          I am the germination of seed in the Spring
          And the ripening of wheat in the Sun.
          I am the peaceful depth of the twilight
          That soothes the soul when day is done.

          I am found in the twinkling of an aged eye...
          And found in the birth of a newborn pup...
          Yes...Birth and Growth and Death, am I
          I am the gracious Earth, on whom you sup.

          I am your sister, your mother, the wise one.
          I wrap you gently in the warmth of my love.
          That which your seek you shall find within:
          Not without...not below...not above!

          Remember always, my children, be reverent.
          Be gentle, loving and kind to each other
          And hold sacred the Earth and its creatures:

          (First part is spoken)

          I meet many kinds of pagans everywhere I go.
          The other day I met a grup who worshipped GI Joe.
          There are many pagan pathways, some ancient and some quaint.
          I thought I'd take this chance to speak of several things that ain't!

          Being in the SCA does not make you a pagan
          Whatever faith your personna doth profess.
          A pentagram on your device
          Don't make you pagan, though it's nice.
          A ritual robe is more than fancy dress!

          CHORUS:
                  Don't make a mockery of all I hold dear.
                  My path is not a hobby or a game.
                  It isn't something that you play,
                  It's something you live every day
                  And if you don't, you don't deserve the name.

          Going to a sci-fi con does not make you a pagan
          However great a filker you may be.
          The spiritual path that I am on
          Is more than "Mists of Avalon"
          Or any other book by MZB!
          CHORUS:
                  Don't make a mockery of all I hold dear.
                  My path is not a hobby or a game.
                  It isn't something that you play,
                  It's something you live every day
                  And if you don't, you don't deserve the name.

          Playing advanced D&D does not make you a pagan
          However high a level you may be.
          I hate to sound like such a bitch,
          But spell points don't make you a witch!
          Initiations don't come with EP!
          CHORUS:
                  Don't make a mockery of all I hold dear.
                  My path is not a hobby or a game.
                  It isn't something that you play,
                  It's something you live every day
                  And if you don't, you don't deserve the name.

                                   By Ellen Cannon Reed
          I'm a solitary pagan
          And I want to learn the Art.
          So I've gone to many teachers
          And I've asked them from my heart.
          But everyone I've gone to
          Has balked at teaching me,
          And I just don't understand it,
          'Cause I begged on bended knee:

                  GIMME GIMME GIMME

          I don't want to join a tradition.
          Wanna do things my own way,
          And the way I'll do them tomorrow
          Won't match what I'll do today.
          I don't want just one tradition,

          And I think that all of the teachers
          Should just hand over their stuff.

                                      Eyes of a DYKE 
                                     by Vivienne West

          "She's one, you know," Anne said, not entirely pleasantly.

          "Yeah,  it shows.  You know,  in  two years  she's never  once worn  a
          skirt?"

          "And she walks so heavy. Not like a woman at all."

          "You got to admit she takes care of her face, though."

          "Yeah, but in that job you have to."

          "You   never  know,  she  might be  straight,"  I  said,  joining  the
          conversation for the first time.  They both turned looks of  disbelief
          at me.  "Maybe,   for  all  you  know,  I  might be gay," I  added, to
          reinforce the point. They relaxed and laughed. I was wearing a peasant
          skirt and embroidered blouse.

          The conversation  turned to other things. Just  before the teabreak  I
          went   to the   ladies.  There   was no one  there.  Washing  my hands
          under the tepid water ruminatively, I  looked at my reflection in  the
          dirty  mirror.  Did  that  look like  the  face of  a lesbian?  Round,
          soft features framed  by wavey, long hair  that was always untidy  and
          looked rather good untidy. A  neck with a string  of jade beads around
          it, a neck white and soft. I returned to my desk.

          One  of  the managers was leaving  the room just as  I got back.   "He
          asked if we knew what you were doing over the weekend," Sandy informed
          me. "If you ask me, I think he fancies you."

          "He's  all right," said Anne.  "Wish he'd ask after me,  that's  all. 
          Will  you talk to him?"

          "I don't see why," I replied evenly.

          "Oh! Got a new boyfriend?"

          "No," I smiled. "But that doesn't mean I'm looking, either."

          "Sure." They both smiled in disbelief.

                                    *     *     *

          When   I  let   myself  in,  the  house   smelt  faintly   of incense.
          Bounder, the overenthusiastic labrador cross we had inherited from the
          last  tenants,  was not  around,  nor   was  Yvonne.  They  must  have
          been at the park.   I put the shopping  down on the floor, put  on the
          kettle,  lit another joss-stick and made tea, watching the thin stream
          of smoke curl up  towards  the  ceiling  in  the faint arabesques of a
          strange language.

          Later,  the shopping still  waiting to be put away, I listened  to the
          sounds of the  bouncy dog and the  front door opening.   He greeted me
          wetly,  jumping  all over  me   and  the chair I was occupying. Yvonne
          greeted me  casually, brushing cool  lips lightly across  my forehead.
          "Hungry?"

          "Not really."

                                           1932
          


          "Okay."

          (How do you say I  love you without using words? How do you convey the
          ache  in the belly without moaning?)

          I   went   to  bed early,  listening to  the silent  sounds of  Yvonne
          working  at her  books in  the next  room. Every  so often  a muttered
          curse, or the  clatter  of   a dropped   pencil. Bounder, I  knew, lay
          over  her feet under the table. I drifted  over and around the edge of
          sleep.

          I  didn't notice  her come  into the  room and  undress, but  I roused
          slightly  and moved  towards her as she slipped into the bed.  "Sssh,"
          she soothed, stroking my arm gently. "Go back to sleep."

          "You  know what  they  were talking  about,"  I muttered  through  the
          incoherence of sleep, my  lips feeling thick. "Dykes." I  relished the
          word:  I knew  she  hated it.   "They were talking about dykes.   They
          think I'm  straight." I could feel  a hysterical giggle rising  in me,
          but  I didn't have the energy to   let  it  out.   Instead  I  drifted
          back   to  sleep,  not  knowing   or  caring  if Yvonne had understood
          me.

          In the morning I stood naked  in front of the bathroom mirror brushing
          my teeth as she showered. She was  singing under her breath, splashing
          the  mouldy  walls with  soapy  water  as  she  washed.  I gargled and
          spat,  and searched  my eyes  closely, deep  blue eyes  with startling
          white lines  running from the pupils  to the very edges of the irises.
          The eyes of a dyke.

                                  Second Ritual For Bast 
                                      Chris Olmstead
          Gwen called  me up to tell  me that her nineteen-year  old Siamese cat
          Coco, who  raised her from  a small child  and taught  her innumerable
          wisdoms, had  just come out of  surgery and was  not doing well.   She
          talked about how her sister Lisa went to the vet every day to sit with
          him, talk to him,  and give him her love.  Gwen said she was burning a
          blue  candle next to his picture in  order to promote his healing, and
          was that O.K.?  To answer her I mentioned as a gentle aside that I had
          heard that green  was also good  for healing.   We talked  cats for  a
          while.  She  cried.  I  remembered Buttons, fought  tears, and then  I
          understood what pain she faced here.  She kept talking until I offered
          that I too might do a healing spell  on his behalf.  She jumped on  my
          words with an  eager "Oh! Would you?!"  and I suddenly understood  the
          real question behind this phone-call.

          I explained  that a cat who  has seen nineteen summers  has really had
          the  best of it  already, and that a  spell which holds  him to a body
          which is obviously failing him might  be no kindness.  She agreed.   I
          explained that he might just be ready to go, now...since  she has been
          raised, and  even her  little sister  Lisa--with whom  Coco lived--had
          just graduated college.  I agreed to do a spell which  sent him energy
          to do with as  he chose, either  to heal or  to move on.   She made  a
          hopeful sound  that with healing,  he might  choose to stay,  then she
          hung up.

          I went quiet, thinking how best to do this.   I mentally reviewed past
          spells that  have worked, and why.  Spells of "recovery" (whether they
          have been  for illness,  or  finding Buttons  when he  was  lost in  a
          strange  and  distant city,  or simply  gaining  the return  of stolen
          things) have  worked best when I look at the  web as it was before the
          undesired  event, compare it  to the web  as it is after,  and (if the
          difference  is not too great) then shape the web with my mind until it
          resembles what has been and consequently have the item in question pop
          back into my reality like a watermelon seed squeezed between thumb and
          forefinger.

          Here I sought to couch this knowledge within the Wiccan framework I am
          studying.  I  understand how the use  of a ritual  (or a language,  an
          image, a habit, anything) taps  into all those who have ever  used the
          same thing,  and knits their  gifts together  on the time-line.   More
          mundanely,  I understand   how my  own establishment  of the  habit of
          ritual will build powerful cues in my mind which make  spell-work more
          efficient.  Out of respect for what my teachers have  been showing me,
          I determined  to do it perfectly...while  no one was around  for me to
          feel awkward before.

          How might my  Priestess teacher  compose her Altar?  What things,  and
          what Deity shall be the focus?  Well, obviously Bast...and such things
          as Bast might like.  I thought back to  the ritual I wanted to do with
          Bast  for healing  Le-oh.   I plundered  the memory  of it  for useful
          items.   I remembered:   Bast likes  golden necklaces and  other shiny
          things,  images of cats, soft  lights that don't  damage night vision,
          and suddenly, I laughed aloud as  I was inspired to offer Her cat-nip.
          It just felt right.  So I  laid these all out (along with the  "usual"
          things):  My first piece of jewelry--a golden cat pin, inscribed "Save
          a  Cat" from the Save a Cat League  of New York, my finest gold chain,
          two teak cats from the  orient,  my golden ankh, scarab  necklace, and
          the  spread-winged Horus-falcon I got when I visited the exhibition of
          Ramses  II.  I  placed a bud-vase next  to the water  cup and went out

                                           1934
          


          into the night to gather a perfect sprig of fresh cat-nip.

          A deep  breath, and  I began  by lighting  the tiny  oil lamps  on Her
          Altar...

          Standing before Her altar I closed  my eyes and reached for the images
          of the  web when Coco  was well  and compared how  it is now.   Images
          slipped  and swam.  The differences were  great.  I pictured Gwen, her
          candles  and photographs, and  knitted us all  into the  circle with a
          breath.  Then the images  left.  I opened my eyes and spoke softly but
          aloud.  (I'm trying  to cultivate that ability.)   Before me,   my cat
          images glimmered.  I remembered the scene where Thomasina visits Bast.

          I went there  too.  I breathed  energy into myself, and held  it in my
          belly, as my Sensei taught me.  Then I said:

          "Oh Bast--I'm  here on behalf of  your charge Coco, and  his human, my
          friend Gwen.  Coco is old, and it may be that his time has come.  It's
          true he  has lived long,  but some cats  do live longer.   If  this is
          still something about which  there is uncertainty and choice,  let him
          use this energy to  heal.  If it is really time for  him to go, then I
          don't wish to stop  him.  Let him use  this energy to go on  into what
          ever  comes next  for him,  and have  an optimum and  right... 'coming
          forth into the day'."

          (I  wanted to  say  'death and  re-birth,'  but suddenly  that  wasn't
          accurate
          here...)  I then continued, asking:

          "Oh Bast, how hard is it to just let things be as they have  been, for
          just a little longer?  He is old, but old-age isn't a crime..."

          and  suddenly a  voice  broke in  just  behind my  right  ear, and  in
          perfectly lucid English She answered softly:

          "...and Death is no punishment."

          It shook me  a moment.  As  soon as She said  it I recognized She  was
          right-- (hence--right side?  Or R/L Brain?) It humbled me to realize I
          had  thought that death WAS punishment.   I knew that  She was gone as
          soon as  She had spoken,  and there  would be no  point to  turning to
          look.   I felt the  energy go out  of me toward  Coco, and I  knew the
          spell  had worked  but that I  hadn't gotten  the answer  Gwen wanted.
          That saddened me, even knowing what She said.  I thanked Bast, thanked
          and dismissed the watch-towers, and went to bed to think about it all.

          Early the next morning Gwen called to thank me for talking to her, and
          to tell me there was no need to  make the spell for Coco.  He had died
          in his  sleep during the night...now at least he wouldn't have to face
          another surgery.

          I  told her I had  already done the spell, and  it was my feeling that
          Coco was o.k.  I mentioned that I thought  he had taken the energy for
          use in his next reality.   I said everything I could think of  to help
          her feel better.   I don't recall whether I told her what Bast said to
          me or not.

          When  I went to  the altar to  take it all  down, I noticed  the water
          level  on the cat-nip had dropped below  the stem and it had withered.
          Somehow that was fitting.   It meant many sad and  happy things all at

                                           1935
          


          once.  It meant that She had accepted the gift by taking the essential
          freshness  of the  offering;  It meant  that  things die,  and  that's
          natural; It  meant that when the  vitality is gone, the  flesh can not
          stay.  So it is with what I know of death.

                                    WCC BELTANE RITUAL  
                                    By Lynna Landstreet


          Personnel required:

              Several drummers and other musicians if possible. A priest and
                  priestess  who will represent the God & Goddess (and should be
          garbed
              appropriately), referred to herein as P & PS, plus a priest or
                  priestess who will read  the meditation and "stage-manage" the
          ritual
              (referred to herein as "N" for Narrator)

          Tools/Supplies required:

                  Very few. Thereshould be afire in the centreof the circle,and 
            a chalice of wine and a bowl of Nine Holy Herbs spray or other
              concentrated alcohol (we ended up using Jamaican overproof rum,
              which worked very well -- flared up about six feet high!).

          Bring in the people and have them sit. Have the musicians sit together
          in  an inner semi-circle, behind  the Narrator. One  drummer should be
          playing  a  slow, hypnotic  heartbeat during  the  first party  of the
          ritual.  The priest  and  priestess who  will  represent the  God  and
          Goddess should be hiding near  the circle, and approach when the  part
          about them drawing near begins.

          N:   "Beltane means many things.  It is a celebration of spring coming
          into full  flower, of the return  of the Goddess from  the underworld,
          the
          mating time of the animals, the return of the sun, and many other
          things. Above all, it is a celebration of life. But for us, here in
          this community, it is also the time when we leave the confines of our
          building and return to the temple of the forest.
              "Wicca is a nature religion, but too often we worship in concrete
          cages, cut off from that nature, and from our own natures. And as we
          have now returned to nature in our choice of ritual site, I ask you
          tonight to return to  nature in your hearts and minds as well, for the
          ways of  the world within  walls are not  necessarily the same  as the
          ways of the world outside.
                  "We meet in a small fragment of forest, within acity park. But
          now, I  ask you to forget the  city that surrounds us.  In your mind's
          eye, let the  city fade away and the forest extend on and on, covering
          the  land that  only moments ago  was buried under  concrete. For once
          this land was wild,  and covered with trees,  not buildings. Once  the
          rivers and streams ran free,  and the air was fresh and  fragrant with
          the  scent of  cedar and  sweet fern,  not fouled  by car  exhaust and
          factory  smoke. And it may  be that one  day, it will be  so again, we
          have no way of knowing.
                  "But for now, picture the forest extending on and on,as far as
          you
          can imagine, in all directions. The great wild forest surrounds and
          embraces us, and we are the people of the forest.

          the circle,  for we have each other, our hands, our minds, our bodies.
          Join  hands, and breathe in deeply, and  breathe out, as one. Feel the
          circle being formed now by our  touch, the energy leaping from hand to
          hand, deosil,  around the circle.  Feel it forming, a  place set apart
          from the trials of daily life, a sacred, wild place...
                  "Here in the great wild forest, we have no  need of a besom to
          cleanse our circle, for  we meet in the  wilderness, which is  already
          clean and pure, and by its touch are we made clean and pure ourselves.

          purify
          our  circle, for  we have  the arching  sky above  our grove,  and the
          rushing
          wind that ruffles our hair and caresses our skin.  Breathe deeply, and
          take the wind  and the sky into  yourself. The spirits of  the air are

          circle,  and the stars above.  See the leaping  flames now, hear their

          silently, in your own way...
                  "Open yourself, now, to the pulseof life all around you. It is
          there, if you can free your spirit  enough to sense it. Feel the  life
          straining to be born in every  sprouting seed, the exhilaration of the
          blossoms bursting  from their buds on  the trees, the joy  of the very
          grass  itself, of  every bush and  shrub and  piece of  moss, greening
          again as the earth is warmed by the sun, as the life-giving rains fall
          from the sky, and all  of nature is borne  into the ecstatic dance  of
          life's return. And feel,  in the midst of it all, the  presence of the
          Lord and  Lady, who are the  soul of all nature,  the consciousness of
          the  wild, the beauty of the green earth,  the sun and moon and stars,
          and the mystery  of the waters. Feel them  approaching! Even now, they
          near our circle, drawn by our love and our joy in their creation. Feel
          their power,  their nearness... they approach... they come... THEY ARE
          HERE!"

          the earth like shooting stars, adding power to the transformation that

          In Her arms a holy Child
          Promises a glowing Light
          Through the winter wind so wild
          He proclaims the growing Light.
             Glo -- ria! (etc..)

          Now the turning of the year
          Of the greater Turning sings

                               The Corn Play (Lammas Ritual) 
                     Coven of the Morning Star and Stella Maris Coven


          Requirements:

          Lammas Lord Crown (Wheat, Rye, Corn, fruit and flowers)
          Corn Queen Crown (Wheat, Rye, Corn etc)
          Fresh-baked bread
          Honey
          Red Wine
          Cords to bind the Lammas Lord
          Green cloth to cover him
          Lammas Cup and cloth to polish
          "John Barleycorn" music


          Ritual Begins:

          Priestess and Priest cast circle and invoke quarters
          (Lammas Lord and Corn Queen remain outside circle).
          A gateway is cut, and everyone calls to the Corn Queen to
          enter the circle:

          Queen of the Corn, Queen of the Fertile Earth; come to us now,
          for we have need of you & etc.

          The Queen enters, and then leads the call for the Lammas Lord
          to enter the circle.

          God of the Meadow, God of the Hill, God of the Corn and of our
          True Will, come to us now, for we adore you & etc.

          The Lammas Lord stands in the centre of the Circle, and is
          washed by the women (each Priestess takes the aspergillus in
          turn, and asperges the Lammas Lord - Corn Queen first).

          Then each one polishes the Lammas Cup, which is returned to
          the altar, and filled with red wine. (Corn Queen takes cup and
          cloth to each person).

          Then the Queen stands before the Lammas Lord and says:

          To kill the King
                               (Coven: For what purpose kill?)
          To feed the land
                               (Coven: What feeds the land?)
          The blood of the King
          The honour of the King
          The life of the King

          Two priests step forward, and bind the Lord's hands behind his
          back, and tie his ankles together. NB: do not knot the cords,
          as the Lammas Lord must be able to extricate himself from the
          bindings.

          The men all turn and face outwards from the circle. The Corn
          Queen takes her athame, and the cup of wine, and "cuts the
          throat" of the Lammas Lord, catching his blood in the chalice.
          The women help the Lammas Lord to the ground, and cover him
          with the green cloth. His crown is placed upon the bread, on
          the altar. A female Elder stands at the head of the Lammas
          Lord, and a Maiden stands at his feet. They are his mourners.
          The men turn back into the circle, and the Corn Queen leads
          the weaving dance to "John Barleycorn".  When the music
          finishes, all stand facing outwards (including Elder and
          Maiden).  The Lammas Lord removes his binds and cover, and
          silently makes his way to the altar. He takes up the bread and
          wine, and leaves his crown on the altar. He returns and stands
          centre. The Corn Queen acknowledges the mystery of the re-born
          grain:

          "Behold the Mystery! The grain, the crop, the food."

          As she speaks, everyone turns and faces in once more.

          The Queen steps forward, and kneels before the re-born grain
          saying again, "behold the mystery". She rises, and drinks from
          the cup. The "Lammas Lord" breaks a piece of bread for her,
          which he gives to her as she hands back the cup. She walks to
          the altar, and dips the bread in the honey. Then the next
          person steps forward, and repeats her actions. Then each in
          turn until all have knelt to the re-born grain, and had some
          wine, bread and honey. It is important that the Lammas Lord
          does not speak throughout the ritual.

          The circle is closed, and the feast begins.

          This ritual is freely adapted from a traditional ritual
          practised in the north of England.
