          ** MAGICK 4 -- ELEMENTS AND FORCES **



                          The Ancientsdividedthe worldintofour basicprinciplesor

          *elements* -- earth, water, fire, and air.   That viewpoint has mostly

          changed  with advances  of science,  but the  four elements  are still

          accepted in magick,  for they are more  closely linked with  emotions,

          the human psyche, and with nature than are modern  explanations of the

          world. These

          *magical elements*  are also of  some importance  in astrology.   Many

          occultists think of  the magical elements as forces, or as *qualities*

          of energy;  especially within  the astral world.   Each element  has a

          symbol and color. (Common symbols are -- fire: a triangle pointing up;

          air:  a triangle pointing  up and with  a horizontal line  through the

          middle  of it;  water:  a triangle  pointing down;  earth:  a triangle

          pointing  down and with  a horizontal line through  the middle of it.)

          Colors of  the elements are  -- earth: brown  and green; water:  blue;

          fire:  red; air:  yellow...The Eastern  tattvic system  uses different

          symbols and colors.  (The tattvic symbols are  briefly described later

          on in this course.)  The elements are often used in magick ritual.



                          Magickseesrelationships
                                                betweenthings.Theserelationships

          are called 'correspondences'. Although magical correspondences are not

          literally equal to one another,  you can think of them that  way (such

          as gold  equals sun). Tables  of these relationships,  called 'Corres-

          pondence Tables', are available (an important one is Crowley's '777').

          Thus  one thing  or symbol  can be  used to  suggest another.  This is

          important in

          magick, for the magician may surround himself with as many appropriate

          correspondences as he  can to vividly affect  the senses; thus  making

          his magical contact with the inner planes more lucid.

          ELEMENTALS



                          The magicalelements are saidto bepeopled by spiritsand

          mythological entities called  elementals or nature spirits.  These are

          grouped into four main categories --


                                           1303

          =============   ==============  =================  ===========

          sight  and are  more likely to  be seen  at night in  the mountains or

          country away  from cities --  especially if you  are tired  or sleepy.

          Although elementals exist naturally, it is also possible to create one

          which will exist for a limited time -- no elemental has immortality. A

          created elemental is called

          an 'artificial elemental'.

          the universe. However,  some contemporary occultists see  them only as

          symbols  for forces  and  otherwise not  'real' at  all.  Another word

          sometimes  used  for  elemental  is 'familiar'  (usually  in  medieval

          witchcraft); the term  is ambiguous, as it might merely be an ordinary

          household pet such as a dog or cat.

          ** MAGICK 5 -- CHAKRAS AND MEDITATION ** 

           

                          AccordingtoEastIndianphilosophy,manpossessessevenmajor

          *chakras*  or  psychic centers  on his  body.  Each of  these  forms a

          bridge,  link, or  energy transformer;  changing pure  (higher) energy

          into  various forms,  and connecting the  four bodies  (ie. spiritual,

          mental, astral, and physical) together.  The chakras are located along

          the nadies  (a network of  psychic nerves or channels)  and follow the

          autonomic nervous  system   along the  spinal cord. Chakras  correlate

          with major  acupuncture points  along the 'governing  vessel meridian'

          (acupuncture term).  The seven major chakras are connected together by

          three major nadies  which are parallel and near each other. The middle

          nadi is called *sushumna* and it has neutral characteristics. The nadi

          on the left (ie. nearest your  left hand) is the *ida* nadi which  has

          yin characteristics. On the other side of sushumna 

          (nearest  your right hand) is the  *pingala* nadi, having yang qualit-

          ies.

          rotating circles or funnels. In the East they are described as petaled

          flowers or lotuses. Sources disagree on the  colors. 

           

                          The first chakra,located at thebase of the spineat the

          perineum is the *root chakra*, muladhara. It primarily  relates to the

          element of earth and to psychic smell.  

                          Thesecondchakra,knownasthe*sacralcenter*,svadhisthana,

          is  located above  and behind  the genitals.  Its dominant  element is

          water, and it is related to psychic taste.

          at the navel and corresponding with  the emotions and with the element

          of fire; also with psychic sight (clairvoyance).  

                          The*heart chakra*,anahata, isthe fourthchakra, located

          over the  heart and corresponding  with the  element of air,  and also

          with psychic touch.

                          The remainingtwo chakrasare very important.They relate

          mostly to elevated states of  consciousness. The *frontal chakra*, (or

          'third eye') ajna,  the sixth chakra, is located between, and slightly

          above,  the eyebrows.  Ajna is the  center of  psychic powers  and can

          produce  many psychic  effects.  Meditation on  ajna is  said  to cure

          nervousness. 



                          Finally,the*crownchakra*,sahasrara,locatedatopthehead,

          (pineal gland) is the seventh chakra.  It is referred to as the thous-

          and-petaled lotus and corresponds  with astral projection and enlight-

          enment. 

           

                          Thereare alsomany minorchakras throughoutthebody. Each

          chakra  has a sound  (letter) and a  pitch which is  sometimes used to

          invoke it.

          YOGA 

           

                          Yoga originated inIndia. It is aphysical or mentaldis-

          cipline designed to condition and invigorate the mind and body.  There

          are many kinds of yoga,  but they may be generally divided  into three

          main types... 

                          Hathayoga--affect themindthrough thebodyusing physical

          exercises; improve physical health and endurance. 

                          Rajayoga-- affectthemindthrough mentaltraining;improve

          concentration. 

                          Mantrayoga --affect themind throughchanting andaffirm-

          ation; achieve relaxation. 

           

          MEDITATION 

           

                          This is a much touted areaof the occult. There aremany

          meditation  techniques,  and many  claims  made  for  the benefits  of

          meditation. Basicly,  meditation has two functions  -- relaxation, and

          perhaps, improved concentration. There are two main types... 

           

                  1) concentration meditation (focusing), 

                  2) insight meditation (mindfullness). 

           


                                           1313


          Most  kinds  of meditation  are  the  concentrative type.  One  simply

          focuses his attention upon a single physical object (such  as a candle

          flame); upon a sensation (such  as that felt while walking  or breath-

          ing);  upon an  emotion (such  as reverence  or love);  upon a  mantra

          spoken aloud  or even silently; or upon  a visualization (as in chakra

          meditation, seebelow)...Concentration  meditation  is, simply  put,  a

          form of self-hypnosis. 

           

                          Amantra(or mantrum)is oneormore wordsorsyllables which

          are repeated --  often chanted -- aloud...A simple yet powerful mantra

          is  to vibrate  the  mystical word  'OM'.  This mantra  has  long been

          associated in India with the  godhead/unity.  Use it to aid  in tuning

          into universal  vibrations which  promote feelings of  harmony, peace,

          and well-being. Use it before magick ritual to 'get into the mood' and

          afterward to 'dismiss the 

          forces'. You vibrate  a mantra by saying it slowly  aloud in a lower--

          pitched voice  than your  normal speech, and  a more or  less constant

          pitch as well. Let the sound fade at the end of the mantra. A powerful

          one such as 'OM' will seem to vibrate the air around you. It should be

          vocalized  for 5-10 seconds and repeated a  number of times with a few

          seconds rest between each vocalization.  Chanting of mantras may cause

          slight dizziness from hyperventilation.

                          Theothermaintype ofmeditaiton-- insightmeditation-- is

          the analysis  of thoughts  and  feelings in  such a  way  as to  cause

          realization of  the subjectivity and  illusion of experience.  This is

          done in  a effort to  attain trancendental awareness.  Such statements

          as, 'This  body is not me', fall  under this category. Buddhist medit-

          ations are usually of this type. 

           

          CHAKRA MEDITATION 

           

                          Thereis aspecialtype ofconcentrativemeditation whichwe

          will  call 'Chakra meditation'. This is  basicly Kundalini yoga -- the

          practice of  causing psychic energy  (kundalini) to flow  up sushumna,

          energizing the various chakras along the way. The practice, considered

          dangerous by 

          some, will produce  deffinite physiological sensations  and psycholog-

          ical effects  if continued long enough. It  should not be attempted by

          epileptics or persons with  an unstable mental or  physical condition,

          or with heart  disease. Certain drugs and  medications, such as  those

          used to treat  epilepsy may retard progress. Although the technique is

          very simple,  it may eventually produce powerful  results. Results may

          at first appear hours after the practice during  sleep. As each chakra

          is energized  by this practice, it  is said to add  occult powers (si-

          dhis), until  at last the crown  chakra is reached, and  with it, full

          enlightenment is attained. Sometimes kundalini awakens all by itself.

          the chakras, beginning with the root chakra, and moving  progressively

          up, as  you visualize psychic energy from the root chakra traveling up

          shushumna and  vivifying  each  higher  chakra. As  we  mentioned  the

          chakras have  certain properties  associated with  them, so that  this

          type of visualization may 

          'raise consciousness', promote astral  projection, and other things --

          once you have reached ajna and eventually the crown chakra. You  might

          typically  meditate in this  fashion for 15  minutes to a  half hour a

          day. It  might  help to  practice some  hatha yoga  or other  physical

          exercise  in an effort to  make the spinal  cord 'more flexible'. Diet

          may also  affect the  process. The  technique is  also similar  to the

          Tibetan 'Tummo'  meditation.    The  rise of  kundalini  is  sometimes

          experienced as a 'vibration' or buzzing, as light, or as heat.

          HEALTH AND DIET 

           

                          Certainly theway you treatyour physicalbody willaffect

          your mind. In magick you want an alert mind. Therefore, your body must

          be  as healthy as you  can keep it.  Take care of  your body. Exercise

          regularly.  eat a  good diet  (with vitamin  supplements), and  do not

          consume  anything which  will have  a negative  effect upon  the mind.

          Drugs, smoking,, and alcohol 

          should be restricted,  or eliminated. (The mind can create any condit-

          ion which a drug  can create.) A good rule here is  moderation in what

          and how  much you consume. (Most of this stuff is pretty obvious isn't

          it.) You may also want to cut down  on sugar and processed foods. Many

          occultists advise dietary changes,  expecially the non-eating of meat.

          We cannot deny the 

          physical, psychological,  and spiritual  effect which all  foods have.

          This  effect may  be  described as  the 'heaviness'  factor  of foods.

          Various foods are so ranked in the chart, lighter to heavier... 

           

                  1.  lettuce and other greens. 

                  2.  fruits and most vegetables. 

                  3.  wheat, rice, and other grains. 

                  4.  nuts, beans, and other legumes. 

                  5.  cheese, dairy products, including eggs. 


                                           1317


                  6.  fish, seafood. 

                  7.  chicken, poultry. 

                  8.  beef, pork, other red meats. 

           

          Note that  meats,  especially  red meats  are  the  'heaviest'  foods.

          Generally, foods which  are harder to digest,  or which are  higher in

          protein are 'heavier'  than those which are  not. Animal products  are

          heavier than plants. Foods high in carbohydrate (candy, bread, starch)

          are  heavy. However, the 'heaviness' of  foods is not directly related

          to the amount of calories.

                          Whatthismeansis thatforvarious reasons,theheaviness of

          food  in your  diet will affect  your magical experiences.  You may be

          able  to increase your psychic receptivity  ('energy level') by eating

          lighter foods, or  by eating less. Conversely, emphasizing heavy foods

          in your diet, or eating  larger helpings, may help to 'bring  you down

          to earth' should you 'rent the veil'  too much. These are generalizat-

          ions,  of course, and it may  take a number of  days of dietary change

          before  you notice  much  effect. I  do not  advocate  radical dietary

          changes, excessive fasting,  or malnutrition. Your good  health is far

          more  important  in  magick than  any  temporary effect  you  get from

          prolonged starvation. A change in diet will sometimes only 

          produce  a temporary  effect, until  the physical  body adapts  to the

          change. Healthy natural foods and  lifestyle make it easier for  us to

          be  healthy, but  ultimately, good  health is  a mentual  quality (at-

          titude). 

           

          THE FOUR-FOLD BREATH 

           

                          With physicalexercise too, moderation isadvised.  (You

          should  be cautious, or  not attempt it  if you have  a respiratory or

          heart  condition. Check  with your  physician if  in doubt,  and don't

          overdo.) One of  the most useful physical  exercises is pranayama,  or

          controlled  breathing (actually a  type of  hatha yoga  exercise). For


                                           1319


          this and any other calesthentics or  hatha yoga which you might choose

          to do  a 'kitchen timer'  is suggested (many of  these aren't accurate

          for under three minutes, but are helpful for longer periods).

                          Themain purposeofpranayama isto relaxthe bodyand mind.

          There are many kinds of pranayama, but a simple one called the 'four--

          fold  breath' will suffice. This consists  of four short quick inhall-

          ations, then  four short  quick exhallations; then  repeat, continuing

          until the allotted time is used  up. It will take about 1 1/2  seconds

          for  the  four inhallations,  and  about 1  1/2 seconds  for  the four

          exhallations; or about  3 seconds for the complete in-out cycle ('rep'

          for repetition). There  should be  no strain of  any kind during  your

          pranayama. You  will probably notice a  slight dizziness, particularly

          at  first, since  the effect  of pranayama  is to  hyperventilate. Try

          sitting back in a chair with your eyes closed when you  do your prana-

          yama.  Begin a minute a day for  the first week and gradually increase

          up to about five minutes a day. If you do the pranayama befor 

          your magical activity, it will help you to get 'into the mood'.  It is

          also an excellent  aid to relaxation and  tension release.   Pranayama

          should not  be done during  heavy air  pollution. Other exercises  you

          might consider are hatha yoga, calesthentics, walking or jogging.

          ** MAGICK 6 -- THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS ** 

           

                          Although there are hundredsof kinds of divination, the

          principle ones are  astrology, geomancy, the tarot,  the I Ching,  and

          direct psychic  means (especially  clairvoyance).  True  divination is

          more than  a mechanical system,  for it  implies true psychic  interp-

          retation (receiving). Some  form of divination is often used in magick

          ritual to communicate with 

          the entity invoked. 



                          Sincedivination operatesthroughthemind,itisaffectedand

          biased by the  mind. Our attitudes and  fears may alter  it. Sometimes

          results are very detailed,  and accurate -- but not always.  Often the

          future  is plastic and  changeable anyway, and  the use of  magick may

          alter the result.  Thus divination shows tendencies only, which may be

          helpful, but must not rule us. 

           

          DEVELOPING CLAIRVOYANCE

                          It ispossible toimprove yournatural abilitywith clair-

          voyance through  practice. A good  start might be to  look around you,

          then  close your  eyes and try  to picture your  surroundings. This is

          also  good exercise for visualization. And  visualization is an essen-

          tial talent  in magick. Open your eyes  again and check your accuracy.

          Then close your eyes and try it 

          again. When you  use your  physical eyes,  look at  everything like  a

          child seeing it  for the first  time. Let the  vividness of color  and

          form burn into you, until everything takes on a veritable glow. Try to

          capture that  glow  when you  close  your eyes  now and  picture  your

          surroundings. It's just a simple step to extend what you see with your

          eyes closed  into what you remember  seeing in the next  room, or what

          you *imagine*  seeing in the  next building, the  next city,  even the

          other  side of the world. Don't  expect perfect results, especially at

          first.  Just try  to  be even  partly right.  Another  exercise is  to

          picture a clock face, and thereby tell the time 

          clairvoyantly.

          THE AURA 

           

                          Underthe rightconditions,it ispossible toclairvoyantly

          observe  a colored  light around other  people. This  is known  as the

          'aura'.  Sometimes the aura is seen as multi-colored emanations around

          the person, built  up of various differently colored layers and zones.

          Although many 

          occult dabblers claim to be able to see the aura easily and under many

          varied conditions, I seriously doubt that they do.   There are optical

          illusions and qualities  of sight which can  sometimes trick one  into

          thinking he  sees what he does not  see. In this area,  the quality of

          sight known as after image is especially pertinent. Do  this: stare at

          any solidly colored bright object for a few moments. Very intense red,

          green, or  blue are especially good for this. Now look away at a white

          surface and you  will see a phantom image  of the object in  its comp-

          lementary  color (a  red object  will show  green, a blue  one orange,

          etc.).    If the bright object is in front of a light surface, you may

          observe a fringe of complementary color 

          around the object after a few moments. This is all very normal, and is

          used  by some  magical  groups as  an aid  to  visualization sometimes

          called 'flashing colors'. Some silly people will stare at other people

          in the  same way. And when  they see the  after image of  the person's

          clothing,  they think they are seeing  his aura. What is more, various


                                           1325


          meanings have been attributed to the colors of the aura. A psychic who

          can  see the  aura is supposed  to be  able to  determine that persons

          emotional state. Thus  psychic frauds can have  a marvelous time  with

          auras.   One deluded  psychic taught  a class I  attended in  which he

          performed instant psychoanalysis on the 

          basis  of the  supposed aura.  It  was obvious  that  he was  actually

          observing after images from the students clothes!

          It is a general guide, based mostly on Theosophical material.  Various

          groups  may attribute different meanings to the colors.  The colors we

          show  on the  chart are  emotional in  nature; useful  if you  plan to

          create an artificial elemental or do healing.     Surrounding yourself

          with  a particular  color will  tend to  produce the  specific psycho-

          logical  effect described  in the  chart.   That quality  of color  is

          useful in magick ritual.

          THOUGHTFORMS AND SPIRITS 

           

               Whenever  we concentrate  our  thoughts, we  draw psychic  energy

          together.   This is  called a  thoughtform.   Usually the  energy dis-

          sipates  as soon as we break the  concentration, but it is possible to

          purposely  concentrate  energy  in  this way,  producing  very  strong

          thoughtforms.  Such thoughtforms are 

          vortexes or centers of psychic energy.  They  can exist as entities by

          themselves,  at least  for  a while.   They  are  basically inanimate,

          non-thinking forces.  Talking to one is about as logical as talking to

          a chair.  In this way, thoughtforms are similar to elementals, ghosts,

          and  spirits.   All of  these psychic  entities consist  of a  psychic

          energy vortex  which could be described  as a localized field  or as a

          discontinuity of the physical world. 



               Psychic entities  respond to  certain electrostatic and  magnetic

          fields,  and to  other energy  vortexes. That  is why they  respond to

          magick  ritual. Someday, we may accomplish  the same thing with elect-

          ronic  machines. Psychic  entities are  sometimes able  to affect  our

          thought processes. 



               Thoughtforms, elementals, and ghosts  are usually not very smart.

          If they display any  intelligence at all, it is limited.  They are the

          morons  of the  spirit world.   Their  behavior is  usually automatic,


                                           1329


          repetitive, robot-like (just  like some people).   We see that  artif-

          icial elementals 

          are little  more than  astral robots.   Spirits and  deities are  more

          intelligent and volitional. 

           

          DIRECTED ATTENTION 

           

               Your  mind  follows  your  attention. Wherever  you  direct  your

          attention, there will  your thoughts go too. By directing attention to

          a specific place or purpose you *focus* mental energy upon it. 



               For  example: you're  having lunch  in a  cafeteria crowded  with

          people. It is a large place, and everyone there is talking at once, so

          that  the room is a  constant jumble of noise.  You happen to notice a

          man accross  the room; he reminds you of someone. All at once he drops

          his fork and you hear it hit the table. But would you have noticed the

          sound of his fork if  you had not been  looking? No. Only by  focusing

          your attention there were  you able to pick out that  individual event

          and associated sound. 












                                           1330




               It is a dark night.  You are walking and the only light  you have

          is from the flashlight you hold in your hand.  As you move  the flash-

          light around, the  beam of light from it directs  your attention first

          one way then another. Now, the mind is something like  that flashlight

          in the  dark. And by  directed attention,  you point the  mind to  one

          place or another. As with that flashlight beam, you see where the mind

          is pointed; nothing more. The rest is 'noise'. And so  we could define

          mental noise as anything not focused upon. In another way, noise could

          be considered as negative emotions, attitudes, and thoughts which make

          it more difficult to direct the attention. 



               Your emotions  follow your  thoughts quite easily.  Your emotions

          are  not YOU, but are rather reactions  prompted by your model and ego

          -- like  a performance or  an act,  while the real  you watches.  In a

          similar way, directing your  attention toward a specific emotion  will

          cause you to 

          experience that emotion.

          ** MAGICK 7 -- BASIC RITUAL ** 

           

                  'The first part of every ceremony is the 

                  banishing; the second the invoking.' 

                             (--Crowley, Magick, p. 104) 

           

                          Itmay besaid that ritualis thevery heartof magick. For

          it is through ritual that we  achieve our magical results. Ritual is a

          magical  procedure  or  ceremony we  perform  in order  to  change the

          environment.  Usually we think of ritual  as bearing on active magick,

          although certainly, it  can also affect passive magick. Most often the

          change achieved is subjective (it may  be subtle) and in the  physical

          world. Outsiders may put them down to coincidence, but the effects are

          very real. Magical goals for a ritual should not be taken lightly. 



                          Thesuccessfulpracticeofmagick dependsuponstrongbelief.

          The simplest  ritual of  them all  must be belief  itself. If  you can

          believe in your desired results strongly enough, that act is a magical

          ritual which will achieve your results. Even a very  complex ritual is


                                           1334


          no more effective  than strong belief. There are aids to concentration

          which  may help.  Thus  in *creative  visualization*, imagination  and

          controlled breathing are brought into play.

          CREATIVE VISUALIZATION 

           

                          Whenyouwanttomagicallyachievesomething,first pictureit

          clearly in your  mind. The more  deffinite and specific  your idea  of

          what it  is the better. Picture  yourself having it or  doing it. Vis-

          ualize it as vividly and as intensely  as you can and hold it in  your

          thoughts for a few 

          moments. Concentrate on it intensely (it may help to hold your breath-

          ). Feel the energy of desire welling up inside you. Then suddenly feel

          the image or desire released from your mind. Feel the energy filtering

          through the image and intensifying it, as if the image is a 'stencil'.

          Imagine the 

          energy exploding  out from you into the macrocosm in all directions at

          once, and  feel the universe 'tilt' as it reacts to the force. (At the

          same time  it may  help  to release  your breath  suddenly). Feel  the

          energy draining from you.  Finally, *believe* that your  purpose *has*

          been accomplished; that it 

          HAS HAPPENED, perhaps saying something such as "so mote it be", or "it

          is done".

          magick ritual  must always reduce  to these stages  -- 1)  imaging; 2)

          building; 3)  firing.  Sometimes a  ritual must be  repeated every day

          for a while to achieve difficult results or to overcome weak belief.

          THE MAGICK CIRCLE 

           

                          Often animportantpartofformal ritualisthemagickcircle.

          Medieval magicians  considered the circle essential,  and placed great

          emphasis  upon its exactness.   Elaborate  designs were  invented with

          many layers of complex  symbols and words. It was very  important that

          the circle 

          be completely  intact with no breaks in it. The magician and any other

          participants stand in  the circle during ritual. The ritual began with

          a banishing of evil  forces (using the lesser ritual  of the pentagram

          for example) to keep them outside  the circle. Today, circles are made

          on the floor with chalk  or paint, rock salt, or a  rope. Whatever its

          form, the  circle is still an important part of magical protection for

          the magician. This is especially  important for aversive entities  and

          purposes. The  circle also helps in focusing  the energy of the ritual

          toward its purpose,  that is, it keeps it contained until the magician

          is ready to release it. Of course, the magick circle is basicly only a

          symbol, but  it may eventually  be possible  to supplement the  circle

          with electronic equipment for a 

          similar  purpose.  We are  researching  the  practicality of  electro-

          staticly charged Faraday shields.  

           

          ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTALS 


                                           1338


           

                          An artificial elemental isuseful for certain tasks: 1)

          invisible  watcher and observer, telling you  what it sees; 2) psychic

          guard; 3) it can  be used in healing; 4) it is  helpful in other ways.

          Ophiel calls the artificial elemental a 'familiar'. Producing your own

          artificial elemental is fairly easy.  YOU MUST ASSUME THAT THE ACT HAS

          PRODUCED RESULTS, EVEN IF  YOU DO NOT IMMEDIATELY OBSERVE THEM.  It is

          entirely possible to produce one of these little beasties and not know

          it (not being clairvoyant enough to 

          observe it directly).  Therefore, and this is  a general principle  of

          any  magick, never ignore forces you have set into motion. Even though

          you may not see the elemental, you may nevertheless 'feel' it.  



                          WARNING-- Donot useartificial elementalsfor anykind of

          aversive magick  at this point; they  can be nasty little  critters to

          get rid of. Should you have to eliminate one of them which you created

          in error, you  must re-absorb it back into yourself through your will;

          or in some cases you can 'exorcise' it. 

           

          HOW TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTAL 

           

                          You cancreate your own artificialelemental for various

          purposes. An artificial elemental is basically a thoughtform which has

          been  strengthened with emotion. Refer to  the aura color chart in the


                                           1339


          previous lesson  and decide what  color to  make the elemental,  based

          upon  your intended purpose. Apple green  is a good choice for general

          purposes. 

          Then  decide on  a shape  or outline.  Do you  want your  elemental to

          resemble some sort of animal? A simple circle or cloud is a good place

          to start. With  this in mind you can use ritual to create your elemen-

          tal.  Creative visualization  is good  for this. Visualize  it glowing

          before you. A darkened room is helpful for this. 



                          Communicatewithyourelementalwith telepathy,bytalkingto

          it,  or  with creative  visualization.  Your  artificial elemental  is

          closely  linked  to  you and  your  subconscious attitudes.    It will

          generally not  do things  you think  it cannot do.  As in  any magick,

          results relate  to effort  and belief.  Another way of  looking at  an

          artificial elemental is  as an aspect of your personality (sub person-

          ality) which has been detached from you. 

           

          INVOCATION 

           

                          Formalritual usually involves the invocation (ritually

          calling up)  of a god  or goddess,  spirit, or other  entity. In  this

          sense, magick  is somewhat similar  to pagan religion  and witchcraft.

          However, we  consider  magick  ritual a  technique,  not  a  religion.

          Worship need not be involved. 


                                           1340


          Sometimes the invocation of an entity creates an artificial elemental.

                  Crowley says there are three different kinds of 

          invocation -- 

                  1) Devotion to the entity (as in the Bhakti yoga of 

          the Hare Krishna sect; the Faustian devil pact). 

                  2) Ceremonial invocation -- usual method of the 

          middle ages. 

                  3) Drama -- usually needs more than one person (as in 

          a mass).

                          Becauseof themicrocosm-macrocosmidentity,whenyouinvoke

          the gods, you are invoking  aspects of yourself. Jung has  referred to

          the gods as primitive archetypes.   This makes it sound like spiritual

          entities are  illusions. But in fact  the microcosm-macrocosm identity

          does not  discredit the  gods and goddesses.  It instead helps  to il-

          lustrate our relationship to the cosmos.

                          2. Oftenas nota ritualmay produce side-effects,usually

          something similar to, though not exactly the desired goal. If the true

          goal is delayed  (as sometimes happens)  we may see  the side  effects

          first. And if for some  reason the goal is  not achieved at all  ('mi-

          ssing the target')  the side effects may  be pronounced. Examples:  1)

          You use magick  ritual to hurry shipment of  an anticipated package in

          the mail. Side effect -- the next day an unexpected package (the wrong

          one)  arrives instead. 2)  You use  magick ritual  to cause  a certain

          person to phone you. Side effect -- for several 

          days all sorts of people phone you...The sides effects will not affect

          you (or anyone else) adversely unless that is what you inwardly want.

                          3.We maysaywith certaintythat"something alwayshappens"

          when  we perform  a magick  ritual. But  like everything  else, magick

          follows  the 'law of results'. This  means that results require effort

          of some kind.  And if you don't  work hard enough at it  you don't get

          results. Difficult goals have  greater resistance (magical inertia) to

          overcome. If the ritual doesn't produce the desired results there is a

          good chance that  the reason for the  failure is within oursleves.  Be

          certain there is  no contradiction between your model and your magical

          goals. Sometimes self doubt and mental 

          contradictions  (wanting and not wanting at  the same time) may inter-

          fere. The  first step in magick  is to re-program your  model. And, of

          course you  can help your magical  results by working on  the physical

          level toward  your goals. Don't expect  them to fall into  your lap by

          themselves.

                          4)A peculiarqualityofmagickis timedisplacement.Results

          of a ritual are not  usually instantaneous. There is often a  delay of

          12 hours or more. Difficult tasks  or weakly performed ritual are more

          likely to be delayed. In most cases  a slight delay is alright, and it

          gives us  time to get used  to the comming changes.  And sometimes the

          effects of a ritual 

          appear to extend to before the ritual was performed! 



                          5)Because of theway magick works,a ritualmay create an

          emphasis  in what  is sought,  and a  de-emphasis in  everything else.

          Balance  is  therefore important  here.  Once  the magical  result  is

          achieved it may be 'bound'  to you and difficult to get  rid of should

          you later decide to do so. 



          Example: You use a magick ritual to help you find and buy a new house.

          Years  later when you  decide to  sell it,  you are  unable to  do so.

          Consider your magical  goals wisely so  you dont  get stuck with  som-

          ething  you don't really  want. Note that  theory says you  can always

          unbind through ritual what was bound to you...theory says. 



                          6) Sometimesthe environmentappears to reactagainst the

          magick after the results are achieved. This is particularly noticeable

          in  using magick to  affect the weather  (and the main  reason why you


                                           1344


          should  NOT use  magick  to affect  the  weather). For  example...Your

          performance  of a ritual to produce a  sunny day produces a sunny day.

          The next day is sunny, alright, but the rest of the month is  cold and

          overcast. Here  the weather seems  to react to  the magick in  the op-

          posite  way to re-establish its natural  balance. It is something like

          pushing a pendulum to one side and releasing it -- the pendulum swings

          to the other side. To quote 

          Emmerson  -- "For everything you gain  you lose something...". I don't

          know that  this is always true  in magick, but it  does illustrate the

          point. And another  reason not to use magick to  affect the weather is

          that it might foul it up in other parts of the country (world??). 



                          7) Finally,magickritual(orany magickoroccultism)isvery

          dangerous for the  mentally unstable. If you  should somehow 'get  out

          too  far', eat 'heavy foods' as  previously discussed (lesson on chak-

          ras)  and  use  your religious  background  or old  belief  system for

          support. But remember too, that wierd  experiences are not necessarily

          bad experiences.

          ** MAGICK 8 -- HEALING AND BANISHING ** 

           

                          Psychic or spiritual healingis a human potentialwe all

          possess.  Some people  are  especially good  at this.  It  is probably

          easier to heal someone else by occult means than yourself. In addition

          to healing in the presence of the person, there is 'absent healing' in

          which the healing 

          occurs  at a  distance.  Note that  there are  some who  maintain that

          influence on another person without his specific knowledge and permis-

          sion (yes, even  in healing and helping) is black  magick. (After all,

          everybody is living according to his own true will, so that healing or

          helping someone without permission is affecting  his will). This means

          it is important to tell the person  what you are planning to do and to

          ask his permission. The theory of psychic healing is that sickness  is

          characterized (although  not necessarily  caused) by a  deficiency and

          imbalance of vital  energy. Psychic healing transfers  energy from the

          healer to the  sick to repair and rebalance his  energies. If an inept

          healer overdoes the  process, or if he doesn't take  the precaution to

          'disconnect' himself afterwards, he may find himself 


                                           1348


          becoming  sick due  to  energy drain  and a  linkage  to his  subject.

          Similarly, the healer should always be in a good state of health or he

          could unintentionally transfer his illness to the subject.

                          Thebasicmethods ofpsychichealingare: 1)creativevisual-

          ization, 2) prayer,  3) ritual. Creative visualization  is one of  the

          easiest techniques. Mild illness may  yield to only one or  two treat-

          ments; serious  ills will require  many treatments over  time. Psychic

          healing should always  be combined with medical care and treatment. It

          does not replace 

          doctors, medicine,  or hospitals, since different  levels (worlds) are

          involved.  In creative  visualization, we  visualize the  person being

          well. It may be helpful to utilize the appropriate color from the aura

          chart (such as bright apple-green, rose pink, or white) sent as a beam

          to the person  or as a  cloud surrounding him.  This technique can  be

          extended to include a simple kind of yoga in which we feel energy sent

          as we  exhale explosively; the  energy sent either  via the  breath or

          from one of the chakras such as the solar plexus.  Sometimes in absent

          healing it  is helpful  to arrange  a time  for treatment  in advance,

          asking your subject to be in a receptive state of mind and to sit back

          and close his eyes. 

           

          THE BANISHING RITUAL 

           

                          Oneofthemost basicanduseful ceremonialritualsof magick

          is called the *banishing ritual*, or lesser ritual of the pentagram. A

          pentagram (or pentacle) is a five-pointed  star with the point up. The




                                           1350


          banishing ritual is helpful in psychic protection and healing since it

          forms a protective barrier against malevolent forces. The psychic 

          barrier it  creates can  be made  to permit entry  of desired  (const-

          ructive) forces and the exclusion of negative ones.  Thus, the banish-

          ing ritual is an essential first step in almost any formal full magick

          ceremony.  The ritual  requires that  you use  a magical  implement or

          "weapon", such as a 

          ceremonial  knife, wand, or simply point  your index finger, to "draw"

          the pentagram in the air  at each of the cardinal points  (four direc-

          tions). Also, you  will be chanting ('vibrating') some Hebrew names of

          God.  




























                                           1351


                          Holdingyour magicalweaponand facingeast,extend yourarm

          out straight in front  of you. In  this ritual you  will use the  full

          sweep of  your arm to draw the pentagram in  the air. Follow the desc-

          ription below by beginning at the lower left and sweeping your magical

          weapon up toward the 

          right, etc. as  shown. Do not  bend your  arm at the  wrist or  elbow.

          While you do  this, visualize  the lines  and eventually  the star  as

          vibrant white, floating  in the space before you.   You are projecting

          energy to  do this, and the  result will be a  gleaming 5-pointed star

          floating in  the east; visualize this  as vividly as you  can. Now you

          will energize it further 

          by piercing  the center of it  with your magical weapon  and vibrating

          (speaking  slowly in  a  slightly lower  than normal  pitch, remember)

          "Yod-He-Vau-He".

          3. Point to 4:30 position.

          5. Point to 2:30 position.

          ============================================= 

           

                          Thenturn slowlytothe nextcardinal pointinsequence, and

          as you do  so, with your arm still extended in front of you, visualize

          a white line connecting around to the  cardinal point. Trace a similar

          pentagram with the appropriate words and following the same procedure:

                  South -- Adonai Tzaboath 

                  West  -- Eh-Ei-He 

                  North -- Agla. 

          Now complete  the white line drawn  back to the center  of the eastern

          pentagram. Note that the cardinal points must be followed  in a clock-

          wise order, and the pentagram must be drawn in the manner illustrated;

          to do otherwise would change the function of the ritual. The result of

          all  this should be a large  bright white pentagram visualized hanging

          in mid-air 

          at each  of the four directions,  all tied together by  a bright white

          line. You could  now, for example, visualize the pentagrams moving out

          to the circumference of your home, thereby protecting all within. 



                          Thereisalsoa somewhatsimplifiedversion ofthisritual in

          which the pentagram is traced only once overhead and then is energized

          with one of the four names, such as "Eh-Ei-He". Oftentimes the simpli-


                                           1353


          fied  version is  sufficient,  but naturally  the effect  of  the full

          version is more 

          complete.  



                          One ofthe primaryusesof thisritual istoward offpsychic

          attack --  that  is, when  another is  (consciously or  unconsciously)

          attempting to  harm you, cause  sickness, accidents, bad  dreams, emo-

          tional  upset, or  to force  you  to do  something against  your will.

          Fortunately this doesn't  happen very often. The world of the magician

          is fairly safe for the  pure of heart. Psychic attack usually  depends

          upon vulnerabilities.  If you are  not vulnerable  you are safe.  Thus

          unificaition with the  true will is the  greatest protection possible.

          And the use of the banishing ritual is never hurtful. You can even use

          it to hold off negative aspects of 

          yourself.  

                          Otherformsofprotection sometimeshelpful(depending upon

          one's model) are recitation of the 'Lord's Prayer', the 23rd, and 91st

          Psalms.

          ** MAGICK 9 -- ASTRAL PROJECTION ** 

           

                          Astral projection (OOBE,out of thebody experience) isa

          popular  area of occult literature; for  traveling to see other worlds

          and places  while  the physical  body  sleeps or  is entranced  is  an

          exciting  notion. Astral projection is not dangerous. It is as safe as

          sleeping.  Most  dreams are  probably unconscious  astral projections,

          anyway. Although there has 

          been  quite a  bit written on  the subject, astral  projection is dif-

          ficult for many people. The main  difficulty is the tendency to forget

          dream  consciousness  upon   awakening.  Accordingly,  the  successful

          practice of astral projection requires work. 



                          Modernpsychologydiscounts theideaofactual OOBE(thatthe

          spirit  temporarily vacates the physical body).   However, the idea is

          very ancient. The Tibetans have an entire system  of yoga (dream yoga)

          based upon astral  projection. And here we  have an important  assump-

          tion: you are involved  in an OOBE (at least to a degree) whenever you

          dream. What  sets it apart from a full OOBE is your hazy consciousness


                                           1356


          during the experience  and poor recall afterwards.  Many people forget

          most of their dreams completely. Learning astral projection requires a

          kind of inner mental clarity and alertness. 



                          Dreamsare adoor to thesubconscious whichcan beused for

          psychological  and spiritual insight,  and sometimes for precognition.

          Dream  content is  influenced by  external sounds and  sensations. For

          example, a loud external noise (such as a train) will likely appear in

          your dream (if it doesn't wake you up!). Dreams are also influenced by

          events of the previous day, by  your moods, and by suggestion.  Every-

          one  normally dreams 4 or  5 times a night (about  every 2 hours). The

          longest dreams  occur in the  morning. Everyone  dreams. You are  more

          likely to remember  the details of your dream when  you first wake up.

          By keeping a dream diary  you will improve dream recall.  Have writing

          equipment or  a tape recorder at your bedside for this purpose; also a

          light which isn't too bright. Suggest to yourself several times before

          you go to sleep, "I will  awaken with the knowledge of a  dream." Then

          when you do awaken, move quietly (sometimes 

          just turning over  drives the idea away).  Remember first, then  write

          the dream down, and then add as many details as possible. The next day

          check for objective facts and expand if you  can (by remembering 'what

          happened before that'). Once you start remembering your dreams in this

          way, it will become easier to do so. (If you are unsuccessful at this,

          and  *really* want  to  remember your  dreams, you  could  arrange for


                                           1357


          someone to sit  by your bedside all  night long with  a dim light  on.

          Then when he sees your  eyes moving back and forth -- rapid  eye move-

          ments,  a sign you are dreaming -- he can wake you and ask for a dream

          report.) 

           

          FORMS OF ASTRAL PROJECTION 

           

                          Astralprojection maybesubdivided intothree basictypes:

          mental projection,  astral projection (proper) and etheric projection.

          And  your OOBE may  shift between them.   Mental  projection is really

          simple clairvoyance ('remote viewing'),  and 'traveling in your mind'.

          Imagination  plays a key role. The  experience of mental projection is

          not particularly vivid, and you will more likely be an observer than a

          participant. Nevertheless, mental projection  is an important 'way in'

          to astral projection proper. 



                          Duringmentalprojectionandastralprojection youareableto

          travel through solid  objects, but are not  able to act directly  upon

          them  or to move them (if they are in the physical world). This is not

          true  during etheric  projection.  Whether it  is simply  subconscious

          expectation,  or whether  it  is a  true etheric  projection  which in

          theory means that part  of your physical body has  been relocated with

          your  projection  (the  etheric or  vital  part) may  be  difficult to

          determine.  Etheric projections generally  travel at or  very near the


                                           1358


          physical  world. There are even cases  reported (very, very rare ones)

          in  which the entire physical body  is transferred to another location

          (teleportation),  or cases in which the  physical body exists and acts

          in two separate places at once (bilocation)!  



                          But ourprimary interestis astral projectionproper, and

          mental projection to a lesser extent. Astral and mental projection are

          not confined to the  physical world. Travel  in the mental and  astral

          realms is  feasible, and often  preferred. Nor  are astral and  mental

          projection restricted to the realm of  the earth (you could even go to

          the moon and planets).

          STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 

           

                          The electricalactivity ofthe brainhas beenobserved and

          classified with EEG  (electroencephalograph) equipment; signals picked

          up from the scalp by electrodes, then filtered and amplified,  drive a

          graph recorder.  Brain  activity has  been found  to produce  specific

          ranges for 

          certain basic states of consciousness, as indicated in 'hz' (hertz, or

          cycles/vibrations per second): 

                  delta -- 0.2 to 3.5 hz (deep sleep, trance state), 

                  theta -- 3.5 to 7.5 hz (day dreaming, memory), 

                          alpha-- 7.5to 13 hz(tranquility, heightenedawareness, 

          meditation), 

                  beta  -- 13 to 28 hz   (tension, 'normal' consciousness). 



          As you  can see, some  form of physical  relaxation is implied  in the

          alpha,  theta,  and  delta consciousness.  These  states  are in  fact

          reached through  deep breathing, hypnosis, and  other relaxation tech-

          niques. OOBE  occurs during these  states, and  delta is probably  the

          most important for it. 

          The  problem is really,  as we  have said,  one of  maintaining mental

          awareness  and  alertness while  experienceing  these altered  states.

          Experimental subjects hooked  to an EEG do not show  a discrete change

          from drowsy to sleep; it is very gradual. 


                                           1360


                          Atthe thresholdbetweensleep andwakingconsciousness isa

          drowsy condition known  as the hypnogogic state.  OOBE seems to  occur

          during  this state,  or a  variant of  it. By  careful control  of the

          hypnogogic state  (not going beyond it)  it is possible to  enter OOBE

          directly. 

           

          BASIC TECHNIQUES 

           

                          Mostmethodsofastralprojectionaremethodsofconditioning.

          Some form of  trance or altered consciousness  is always involved.  No

          one  ever projects consciously while fully  awake (some may think that

          they do). Although there are many techniques used to produce an astral

          projection, 

          they boil down to ten of them. They all sort of overlap. 






















                                           1361


                          1) Diet-- Certain dietarypractices mayaid in OOBE,esp-

          ecially at first. These include fasting, vegitarianism, and in general

          the  eating of  'light' foods  as discussed  in  a a  previous lesson.

          Carrots and raw eggs are thought  to be especially beneficial, but all

          nuts are  to be avoided.   Over-eating should be avoided.  And no food

          should be eaten just before an OOBE attempt. If you intend to practice

          during sleep, for  example, allow  2 to 4  hours of  no food or  drink

          (except water) before  bedtime. In general, we see  here the same kind

          of dietary restrictions advocated for kundalini yoga.  



                          2) Progressivemuscularrelaxation--This isoneofthebasic

          methods used  in hypnosis  and self-hypnosis. Physical  relaxation can

          assist  one in attaining the requisite  trance state. These techniques

          involve beginning at  the toes and tensing, then relaxing the muscles,

          progressively up the entire body. 



                          3)Yogaand breath-- Yoga,mantra, andbreathing exercises

          similarly aim at  physical relaxation. The practice of  kundalini yoga

          is  particularly relevant,  since it  is concerned  with altered  con-

          sciousness. In fact  the arousal of kundalini requires a similar state

          of consciousness to 

          OOBE.  






                                           1362


                          4)Visualization --This involvesa typeof extendedclair-

          voyance or picturing of remote surroundings. If you can experience the

          feeling of being there, so  much the better.  Although  this technique

          is  essentially mental  projection,  it is  possible to  deepen mental

          projection into astral 

          projection through  (you guessed it!) visualization.  Crowley taught a

          similar technique: a)  visualize a  closed door  on a  blank wall,  b)

          imagine a meditation symbol on the door, c) visualize the door opening

          and yourself 

          entering  through it.  And J.H.  Brennan describes  similar techniques

          wherein  the door is shaped and colored like a tattva, or alternately,

          a chosen tarrot card is visualized and the student visualizes entering

          into it. 



                          5) Guided imagery -- Inmany respects similar tovisual-

          ization. Except in this case, there is a guide (or perhaps a  voice on

          tape) directing you by  means of descriptions. As  with visualization,

          mental rather than astral projection is most likely. 














                                           1363


                          6)Body ofLight --The oldGolden Dawntechnique. Imaginea

          duplicate (mirror image)  of yourself in front  of you. Then  transfer

          your consciousness and sensation to the duplicate ('body of light'). 



                          7) Strongwilling -- Sort oflike creative visualization

          experienced in the  present. That is you express your strong desire to

          project through your willpower while you visualize yourself doing it. 



                          8) The Monroetechniques -- These are a series of steps

          developed by Robert Monroe: a) relax the body, b) enter the hypnogogic

          state, c) deepen the state, d) develope the senstation of 'vibration',

          e) separate  from the body.  The Monroe  Institute has developed  some

          cassete tapes which are claimed to help in this. 



                          9) Dreamcontrol --This isone ofthe mostimportant tech-

          niques. It involves  becoming aware that you  are dreaming. There  are

          several ways to do this. Oliver Fox says to look  for descrepancies in

          the dream  to realize you are  dreaming. One occult student  I know of

          visualized a white horse which he could ride wherever he wished to go.

          After a  time, when the  horse appeared in  his dreams it  was his cue

          that he was actually dreaming/projecting.  Don Juan tells Castaneda to

          look at his hands while he is  dreaming. And even the tarot and Cabala

          may be used as dream signals. 




                                           1364


          Another method is to tell yourself each night as you go  to  sleep, "I

          can fly"; then when you  do, you will know you are dreaming.  Once you

          know you  are dreaming you can control your dream/OOBE and go anywhere

          you  want.  Repetitive  activities  will also  likely  influence  your

          dreams.  For example, if you are on  an automobile trip and spend most

          of the  day driving, you will  probably dream about driving.   You can

          condition yourself to be aware you are  dreaming by doing a repetitive

          activity many times (walking across 

          the room or a  particular magick ritual, for  example). Then when  you

          dream about it, you will know you are dreaming.  



                          10)Dream expansion--Avariation ondream control.A dream

          may be  *extended* by imagining  it continuing from where  it was when

          you awaken.  Then it is  just a simple  step   to 'astral project'  by

          directing you 'dream'.  



                          Althoughallthesetechniques
                                                   mayappearstraightforward,they

          all require effort. Astral projection is generally learned. 



                          The astral worldis the "ghostland"into which onepasses

          after death. It is sometimes  possible to visit with the dead,  or you

          might be called upon to reassure and assist those who have just passed

          over  (died) or  those who  are consciously  projecting for  the first

          time. Many spirits, 


                                           1365


          elementals  and ghosts exist in the  astral world. The magician should

          feel comfortable there. Tibetan belief is that through proficiency  in

          OOBE, you  no longer need reincarnate after death. The astral world is

          extremely 

          changeable and subject  to your thoughts. Your  will can control  your

          movements in the astral world,  and if you seem to be  going somewhere

          non-volitionally  ('astral current')  it  is probably  your true  will

          causing  it  anyway.  You  might also  experience  heightened  magical

          ability while in the astral realm.

          ** MAGICK 10 -- CABALA ** 

           

                          Western magick isbased uponthe Cabala,a Jewishmystical

          traditon  first written down in 12th  and 13th century southern France

          and  Spain.   It was  oral  before that;  and it  contains the  "lost"

          knowledge of the  ancients, possibly going back  to Egypt and  before.

          The most important Cabalistic 

          books are SEPHIR YETZIRAH (The Book of Creation), and  the ZOHAR (Book

          of  Splendor).  Through Cabalistic philosophy  we are able to classify

          and "pigeon-hole" all of existence. 



                          The fourworlds are recognizedin theCabala, but theyare

          The divine  name of God  is TETRAGRAMMATON  (or name of  four letters)

          made from the Hebrew letters YOD HE VAU HE (English YHVH). Of the four

          letters, YOD corresponds  with Atziluth and the  element of fire;  the

          first HE  corresponds with Briah  and water.  These first two  letters

          make up  a yang-yin pair  (respectively). The  other two letters  also

          form a yang-yin 

          pair (respectively), with the VAU corresponding with Yetzirah and air;

          while the second HE corresponds with Assiah and the element of earth.

          "Tree of Life", Otz Chieem).   The Sefirotic Tree is a diagram  of the

          universe made  up of  the ten  SEFIROTH (primal numbers  or orders  of

          creation) drawn as  circles upon the Tree in a  decending pattern from

          the highest aspect  of God at the  top to the most  physical aspect of

          our world at the bottom.  As can be seen in the  accompanying diagram,

          the sefiroth are connected together with numbered lines, called paths.

                          Above theTree is theinfinite void-- the unknowable,un-

          manifest God as Divine Light -- the three veils of negative existence:

          Ain, Ain Sof, and Ain Sof Aur.  The Divine Light (Ain Sof Aur) is made

          manifest by  the first sefira  where it  is transformed into  positive

          existence.  Emanations of energy (magical current) flow from the first

          sefira  (Source) along the  paths into other  sefiroth which transform

          and emanate to  lower and lower  sefiroth. In  Adam Kadman (primal  or

          ideal man) the sefiroth fit upon the 

          physical body; note  the similarity  to the chakras.   The process  of

          creation is one of emanation from the spiritual at the top of the Tree

          to the  physical world  (Sink) at  the  bottom. All  current which  is

          Sourced into the Tree must also be Sinked (earthed).  That is, magical

          energy set in motion 

          by  ritual shoud be used  up in the physical  world whether or not the

          ritual was a success. 



                          Sefiroth1, 2,and 3on theTree form theSupernal Triangle

          which is beyond normal human experience in the world of Atziluth.  The

          first sefira, KETHER, is the supreme *crown* of God; it signifies pure

          Being, and  is the Source. Kether is  androgynous. Immediately arising

          from Kether are 

          two  further emanations. The second sefira  is HOKMAH, the *wisdom* of

          God  and the  masculine force  of the  universe. Third  is BINAH,  the

          *understanding* or intelligence of God; this is the supernal mother.

                          Between theSupernals and theother seven sefirothis the

          Abyss  -- a  great  gulf which  forever separates  ideal  from actual.

          Within the  Abyss an  11th sefira,  DAATH, the *knowledge*  of God  is

          sometimes placed. 



                          The second triangle, comprised of the 4th,5th, and 6th

          sefiroth in the  world of Briah, is  sometimes called the Mental  Tri-

          angle. Sefira  4, HESED,  the  *love* or  mercy of  God,  is male  and

          positive.  The 5th  sefira, GEVURAH,  the power  or *strength*  of God

          complements Hesed as  justice. Sixth is TIFARETH, as the compassion or

          *beauty* of God; the heart of the universe.

                          Thethird orAstralTriangle containssefiroth7, 8,and 9in

          Yetzirah.  Sefira 7, NETSAH, is the  lasting endurance or *victory* of

          God. Complementing Netsah is 8, HOD, the majesty or *splendor* of God.

          The 9th  sefira, YESOD, the *foundation* of  the world, is linked with

          the  moon, hence  the tides  and the  libido. Yesod is  experienced as

          dream  consciousness,  and  is very  important  in  magick  and astral

          projection. 



                          Finally,at thephysicalworld ofAssiah isthe10th sefira,

          MALKUTH, the *kindgom* of God, and the basis of all material creation.

          We experience Malkuth as sense consciousness. 



                          TheSefirotic Treehasthree verticalcolumns or*pillars*.

          As you  face the tree, the  pillar on the right, headed  by Hokmah and

          ending with Netsah, is called the Pillar of Mercy and has light/mascu-

          line (yang)  qualities. The  pillar on the  left, headed by  Binah and

          ending with Hod,  is the Pillar of  Severity with dark/feminine  (yin)

          qualities.  The  Middle  Pillar  between them  equilibriates  the  two

          opposites,  and is  the *Shekhinah*, or  feminine counterpart  of God.

          The *klippoth*,  or evil  demons, generally  in Assiah,  represent un-

          balanced forces or excesses.

          upon the Sefirotic Tree.   Each numbered part is a numeric key  to the

          various correspondence tables, such as Crowley's '777'.  The sefirotic

          tree has its  parts variously colored and each sefira  has a color; in

          fact the paths  which run between  the sefiroth have their  own colors

          too.   There are  four major color  scales for the  sefirotic tree and

          each color scale corresponds  with one of the four worlds.  That means

          we  are dealing with not just one  sefirotic tree, but actually with a

          separate tree  for each of the  four worlds; although it  is easier to

          think  of it as the same tree  with a different color scale. The Queen

          (Briah) and King (Atziluth) scales are 

          the most important. There is also  the Empress scale (Assiah), and the

          Emperor scale (Yetzirah).

          the SEFIR  YETZIRAH. Due to  the nature of  the Hebrew  alphabet (some

          letters can take two forms) SEFIR  YETZIRAH divides each of two of the

          letters into  two (dual) parts.  For this reason,  it is  necessary to

          divide each  of the two related paths into two (dual) parts. These are

          numbered 31, 31b (bisected); 32, 32b.   Yet when these paths are drawn

          on  the sefirotic tree they are  usually shown undivided (and numbered

          simply 31, and 32).  The following 

          table shows  the colors and location  of the paths in  relation to the

          sefiroth. You will want to add the path numbers to the illustration of

          the sefirotic tree, or draw a new  tree. Some writers may refer to "32

          paths", by calling the sefiroth "paths" 1-10.

          the linking  of higher energy to  lower levels on the  tree. That very

          thing takes place naturally as well, in nature and in  life. A subject

          in  itself is cabalistic meditation (pathwork,  or the way of return),

          in which we attempt to climb up the tree (ladder of lights) to  attain

          union with divinity.

          ** MAGICK 11 -- PSYCHIC ENERGY ** 

           

                          We have seen in the theories of magick, that there isa

          definite relationship between  the 'inner' and 'outer' worlds.  We saw

          this in  the theory of  the microcosm and  the macrocosm; in  the four

          worlds; in the theory  of correspondences; and also in  the Cabala and

          Tree  of Life.   This  relationship between  inner and  outer is  very

          important.  And it means quite simply that  success (or lack of it) in

          one  world (inner or outer) influences success  (or lack of it) in the

          other. Therefore developing of magical ability is more than meditation

          and magical practice, for it 

          implies mastery of the four worlds. The developed magician is not only

          master of the inner worlds; he is also master of himself. 



                          Thisis notto implythat successfulmagicians areall mil-

          lionaires (or  whatever standard  people measure  success by),  but it

          should  mean that  they are  basically pleasant  people, at  least; no

          serious hangups. The  developed magician is described  as a 'king'  in

          the Book of the Law.  This means simply that he has full  control over


                                           1384


          all aspects of his physical  and inner life. He should be who he wants

          to be, doing what he wants to do. 

           

          PLANETARY CORRESPONDENCES 

           

                          The*numbers* in thetables and diagramof the preceeding

          lesson  on  Cabala are  the  'key' numbers  which we  find  in various

          *correspondence tables*  (such as Crowley's '777').  One important set

          of correspondences for the planets, is shown below...

          Notice that  we have included  the metal which is  associated with the

          planet,  as well  as common attributes  of each planet.  The theory of

          Cabalistic magick is  to select the appropriate planet for the desired

          result. The  attribute column will  assist in  that selection. Once  a

          particular  planet  is  determined,  an entity  is  selected  from the

          correspondence tables by  matching the key number. A set of correspon-

          dence tables may be available on this board as a separate file (777.A-

          RC). Additionally,  a list  of selected deities  from several  popular

          pantheons and with a brief description about them  may be available on

          this board as GODS.LST. 



                          AlthoughHebrewMysticismistheoriginalsourceofCabalistic

          ideas, it is mostly unconcerned with the magical implications of those

          ideas. How  can  a religious  philosophy  which is  monotheistic  lend

          credibility to a polytheistic approach? Various deities are understood

          as *aspects* or  *qualities* of the  Supreme God. This  is not a  con-

          tradiction, merely a restatement  of the microcosm-macrocosm idea once

          again. The Sefirotic Tree, in its representation of the universe is 

          the Macrocosm. While it could be said that any single sefiroth has its

          own  separate qualities, it remains, nonetheless,  a part of the whole

          tree, and 

          a part of the macrocosm. As a result, virtually any pantheon or belief

          system is compatible with the Cabala.

          WILLPOWER AND MAGICK 

           

                          Western magick has traditionallyplaced a great deal of

          emphasis upon  the use  of  willpower as  a means  of development  and

          self-mastery.  But this may  not be the  best method in  the long run.

          Isaac  Bonewitz describes  how the  subconscious will  sometimes rebel

          against willpower with  'spectacular results'. It is far better to run

          one's life democratically. 



                          HawaiianKahunamagick describesthe'threeselves', ie.the

          lower self  (or subconscious), the  middle self (or  normal conscious-

          ness),  and the high self (spirit  or Holy Guardian Angel). Enlighten-

          ment  in the  Hawaiian  system consists  of unification  of  the three

          selves. They become 'buddies'. Enlightenment does not  come from great

          change. It comes from  great acceptance. Continual effort at  becoming

          better takes  you nowhere.  For  becoming it  is not  being  it.   The

          unification  is achieved  by first  developing communication  with the

          subconscious and later  with the high self also. Simple exercises with

          a pendulum, automatic writing, raised finger responses, self hypnosis,

          recording and  analysis of  dreams etc. facilitate  communication with

          the subconscious. At  first communication with the  high self must  be

          via the subconscious, but later it is possible to go direct to it.

          PSYCHIC ENERGY 

           

                          Manyoccult groupsfollowan energymodel formagickand the

          physical  body. This  model  (or theory)  equates psychic  energy with

          kundalini/prana/sexual or  life force  energy. The ideal  of kundalini

          yoga is thus  to raise the kundalini to the higher chakras (especially

          ajna and 

          sahasrara) thereby  enhancing psychic/magick  powers.  The release  of

          psychic energy  is also relevant  to mental  control, good health  and

          longevity, and  the attainment  of 'cosmic  consciousness'. Meditation

          and yoga is used to 

          liberate psychic energy  so that it can be used  for magical purposes.

          But there  are other ways  to liberate psychic  energy. Many  of these

          techniques will act as a mental catharsis in the sense of invigorating

          the psyche and 

          resulting in improved intellectual and physical performance.

          the basis of  all listed practices, as  hangups waste psychic  energy.

          Certain psychotropic drugs may have this affect. Also the 'kicks' from

          'risks' like skydiving.

          regressive. However, there is power  there, if you are able to control

          it.

                          Wehave seenhowmagical theoryis baseduponthe assumption

          that psychic phenomena  is real. If  this is so,  then magick is  also

          real. And  we have  also seen how  magick is  the art  and science  of

          causing  change in  accordance  with the  will by  non-physical means.

          Magical philosophy is the 

          working system of  terms, theories, and symbols  upon which magick  is

          based. But magick goes further than  that, for as an ancient system of

          psychology,  magick may be used as is  a means of self improvement and

          spiritual  growth. For magick  and mysticism are  parallel paths, each

          ultimately leading to transcendence.

                         Practical Applications of the Chaossphere 

                                    by Fra.: Neonfaust 

           

          The Chaossphere is the prime working tool of Chaos magicians and the 

          Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT). The physical 

          Chaossphere has a vast range of applications of which a few shall be 

          briefly delineated here: 

           

          Meditation employing the Chaossphere: 

          1, The Chaossphere is a symbol of the primeval Big Bang, it maybe 

          considered as a "frozen explosion" or even as "frozen information". 

          Regard the Chaossphere in a relaxed state, using the 180* stare if 

          you prefer. After a while shut your eyes and meditate on the 

          creative powers of Chaos. Chaos is not disorder let alone entropy 

          but rather the sum total of all possibillities incumbent in 

          existence and the unmanifest as a whole. In this manner you will 

          open the doors to the magickal multiversum for yourself. 

          2, Proceed as described above simultaneously meditating on 

          Nietzsches Zarathustra admonition: 

          "I say unto you: a man must have chaos yet within him to be able to 

          give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: ye have chaos yet 

          within you." 

          You can have this statement read aloud to you by a partner or friend 

          during your meditation (or use a cassette recording). Experience 

          shows that this will greatly enhance the effect described above 

          under item number 1. 

           








                                           1392


          Sigil charging employing the Chaossphere: 

               In lieu of other charging techniques you can project the magickal

          sigil activation into the Chaossphere; banishing (preferably by 

          laughter) should follow immediately. Afterwards aim to forget the 

          whole magickal operation as thoroughly as possible to avoid 

          interference with the sigil`s operation by the unwanted rise of 

          consciousness of said operation/sigil and resultant inhibiting 

          psychic censor activity. 

           

          Drawing energy employing the Chaossphere: 

               To be  performed preferably  after a  meditation with  the Chaos-

          sphere  (see above); regard the Chaossphere in a very intensive manner

          for a  while and stretch your  palms in its direction.  Now close your

          eyes fully  or halfway and  suck in the  powers of Chaos  through your

          palms while inhaling;  exhaling, distribute the energies all over your

          body  or store them  in the  Hara centre  (appr. three  fingers` width

          below the navel).  You will  probably experience these  energies as  a

          warm or cool current, possibly as a slightly tingling sensation. 

           

          Telepathy employing the Chaossphere: 

               During a partner experiment participants concentrate on the 

          Chaossphere (can also be performed with different participants 

          working on different locations); observe in a very relaxed state 

          messages, information and/or images rising from the unconscious. 

          Advanced magicians will find that this experiment can be performed 

          successfully via great distances even without participants 

          practising simultaneously. For Chaos (= pure information) is not 

          restricted by space and time. 






                                           1393


          Astral projection and lucid dreaming employing the Chaossphere: 

               1,  Using the  180* stare  regard the  Chaossphere until  you ex-

          perience a strong suction emerging from the sphere and pulling at your

          "psychic entrails". This can frequently even be felt as a strong 

          physical sensation. Give way to this suction and let your astral 

          body emerge gradually. In the beginning this should be practised 

          partially, ie. the astral body portion extracted increasing with 

          every subsequent attempt. Thus, you may for example only project 

          half an arm the first time, the full at the next go etc. Finally the 

          astral body should emerge totally. Be aware that astral projection 

          may demand weeks` or months`  dedicated practice to succeed, depending

          on personal  talent and inhibitions. Incidentally,  the same technique

          may be  used to  extract the  magickal doppelganger,  personal daemons

          etc. 



               2, Immediately before dropping off to sleep visualize the 

          Chaossphere as accurately as possible and continue as described 

          above. This will induce either stronger astral projection or lucid 

          dreaming or both. This has proved to be an extremely powerful 

          exercise, but it is strongly suggested that you attempt it only 

          after having acquired a thorough working knowledge with the variaant 

          described above under item 1. (If you start off with mental working 

          chances are that you will very soon become severely sloppy without 

          even being aware of the fact; this may in turn inhibit control of 

          magickal powers and could lead to obsession.) You may also want to 

          wake yourself up at 4 a.m. and give this exercise a try for a few 

          minutes before dropping off to sleep again. Take care to note your 

          dreams next thing in the morning, do not - repeat: DO NOT! - rely on 

          your memory alone.

          Activating psychogones/chaoservitors employing the Chaossphere: 

               Use the Chaossphere as a "base camp" and "home" for psychogones/-

          chaoservitors and/or  as a  form of "launching  pad". In  case of  the

          former  the Chaossphere presents itself  as a high  class power recep-

          tacle  and storage  battery from  which you  can extract  your psycho-

          gones/chaoservitors  into the Chaossphere as  you would with sigils to

          be activated; thus,  the Chaossphere will become a gate  to the Sphere

          of Chaos  for your magickal  entities in which  (and from  which) they

          will become active in accord with your bidding. 

           

          Charging magical objects employing Chaossphere: 

               Magical objects such as talismans, amulets, fetishes etc. can be 

          charged with the aid of the Chaossphere by fastening them to the 

          sphere or its tip during a ritual, placing them under it etc. while 

          directing the energies of Chaos into the objects in question. 

           

          Combat magic training employing the Chaossphere: 

               During combat magical training the Chaossphere is particularly 

          suited as a power storage battery out of which the magician draws 

          Magis or Mana. It is furthermore used as a combat target while 

          practising the kiai or other battle cries and martial arts Chi 

          techniques. In the same manner, magickal energy bolts, curses, words 

          of powers and strong affections are hurled emphatically into the 

          Chaossphere where they may be stored for further use.

          Charging the Chaossphere: 

               Experience  has shown  that  the Chaossphere  does  not demand  a

          special 

          charging by ritual etc. Rather, the charging takes place alone by 

          its practical application. Should you desire to incorporate magickal 

          "condensator" fluids or solids (eg. as used for charging magickal 

          mirrors) this can easily be achieved by unscrewing the tips and 

          replacing them after filling in the condensator.

                             THE PACT (IOT) - The Story So Far 

                                      by Pete Carroll



          In 1976 in an abandoned ammunition dump dug deep into a mountain

          somewhere in the Rhineland, two magicians, one English, one German

          announced the formation of a magical order with the celebration of a

          Mass of Chaos in the company of a couple of dozen other magicians.

          Soon after we emerged from the bowels of the mountain a localized

          tornado hit immediate area. This was but a small portent of things

          to come.



          We left the mountain with no particular idea other than to form an

          Order such as had never existed before, that would break the

          existing mold and provide a vehicle for Chaos Magic. A year later

          some of us met in a splendid Austrian castle and formally arranged

          ourselves into the Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros,

          using as a basis a simple structure of four grades and five offices

          that I had devised in the meantime. Since then the Pact has evoked a

          veritable whirlwind of activity, and at the time of writing counts

          some sixteen temples in the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland,

          Australia and the USA. A meeting for all members is now held

          annually, usually at the same original castle (Burg Lockenhaus,

          Austria, 2.-6.August 1991 followed by an Exercitium open for all).

          It is always a wild experimental gathering during which plenty of

          hard work is being done. In devising a structure I sought mainly to

          avoid the mistakes of previous established orders such as the Golden

          Dawn and the Ordo Templi Orientis. A certain division of labour is

          essential just to ensure that people take responsibility for

          organizing that which needs organizing. Beyond that it seems an

          absurdity to form an order on the basis of one or a few persons


                                           1397


          adopting the role of great guru almighty. Their bluff must

          eventually be called, and such organisations are unlikely to advance

          beyond whatever set of ideas they start with. Crowley had to break

          with the Golden Dawn to make his own contribution to magic, and

          Austin Spare had to break with Crowley in his turn. Such progress

          through schism is an idiotic waste of time and effort. Any

          contemporary order which wishes to remain alive, exciting and

          innovative requires a structure or at least a communication network

          to exist at all, but dogmatic ideas, rigid hierarchies and fixed

          teachings and beliefs will kill its creative spirit rapidly.

          Thus in the Pact, the individual temples, which are its basic unit,

          experiment with whatever techniques, rituals and ideas they please,

          and exchange results and inspirations through newsletters,

          magazines, a computerized electronic mailbox system, inter-temple

          visits and the annual Pact meeting. There is thus a natural

          selection of ideas. Techniques, Spells and Rituals which are found

          to be really useful become used and expanded upon whilst the less

          effective material is forgotten. Those members who enter the Pact

          bubbling over with ideas are encouraged to put them into use

          immediately. Naturally in an organisation such as this there is less

          emphasis on discipline than on enthusiasm and creativity. The Pact is

          more interested in those who can experience magic as a living thing,

          than in those who can merely follow instructions. Indeed the only

          power the Pact reserves over its members is the right of expulsion

          for extreme non-fraternal behaviour or for bringing the Pact into

          danger. The Pact has but two aims. Firstly the pursuit of the Great

          Work of Magic and pleasures and profits attendant to this Quest.

          Secondly to act as a Psychohistoric Force in the Battle for the

          Aeon. To fulfill the first aim we provide communication facilities

          that enable us to work together and develop our own magics through


                                           1398


          the exchange of ideas and information. Esoterics should also be fun.

          If you don`t enjoy doing magic you are probably doing something

          wrong. The profits are entirely whatever rewards individuals can

          make from their own magic. There are no membership fees and the

          annual Pact meeting is free and funded by seminars and exercitiums

          that some members hold for the general public plus any members who

          wish to attend. The somewhat grandiosely phrased Psychohistoric

          action in the Battle for the Aeon, consists mainly in spreading the

          philosophy of magical paradigm where we can, in print and by word of

          mouth, although we occasionally perform acts of magic to hasten

          things along.



          The magical techniques and philosophy of the Pact are mainly Chaoist

          in inspiration. Chaos Magic calls for a concentration of the actual

          mechanics at work when planning acts of evocation, divination,

          enchantment, invocation and illumination. It is techniques and

          intention that are important in successful magic. The most Important

          Techniques are those which adjust subconscious belief. Subconscious

          belief controls both the self or selves and the world. So long as

          this is never forgotten one can structure a ritual or spell with

          just about any form of symbolism from Tibetan Tantra to Icelandic

          Runelore. And indeed, where else but in the Pact could you find

          magicians experimenting with Runic Sex Magic? Well perhaps you will

          find other examples. I notice the eclectic approach becoming ever

          more pervasive in esoterics. Insights and ideas are now poached

          shamelessly from one so-called tradition to another, but this is how

          it should be, and Chaos Magic boldly encourages the meta-tradition

          which takes anything and everything that is effective from all

          traditions to create an explosive mixture.




                                           1399


          So, on with the pursuit of the Great Work of Magic, with whatever

          forms of Techno-Shamanism, Tantric Goetia or Greco-Egyptian Quantum

          Physics we can make work for us. There are worlds within us, and the

          universe is infinitely more weird, I`m sure, than all our theories

          put together. Hopefully, some of the explosives the Pact cooks up

          can propel us a little further into these strange domains. I have no

          idea how this years Pact meeting will unfold, except that there will

          be magicians from many lands seated in a huge circle ready to offer

          their specialities in everything from Buddhist sorcery through Norse

          wyrdcraft and Chaos mathematical investment schemes to Voodoo and

          Ice Magics. We have the technology and we`re crazy enough to use it!
