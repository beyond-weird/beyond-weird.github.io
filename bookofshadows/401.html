          Chaos Science
          *
             Modern chaos science began in the 1960's when a handful of open-
          minded  scientists with  an  eye  for  pattern  realized  that  simple
          mathematical
          equations  fed into  a  computer could  model  patterns every  bit  as
          irregular and "chaotic" as a waterfall.   They were able to apply this
          to  weather  patterns, coastlines,  all  sorts  of natural  phenomena.
          Particular equations  would  result in  pictures  resembling  specific
          types  of leaves,  the  possibilities were  incredible.   Centers  and
          institutes  were founded  to specialize  in "non-linear  dynamics" and
          "complex systems."  Natural  phenomena, like the red spot  of Jupiter,
          could now be understood.  The common catch-terms that most people have
          heard by now; strange  attractors, fractals, etc., are related  to the
          study  of turbulence in  nature.  There  is not room  to go into these
          subjects in depth here,  and I recommend that those who are interested
          in this subject read `Chaos: making a new science' by James Gleick and
          `Turbulent Mirror' by John Briggs & F. David Peat.

             What we are concerned with here is how all this relates to magic.
          Many magicians, especially Chaos Magicians, have begun using these
          terms,   "fractal"  and   "strange  attractor",   in   their  everyday
          conversations.
          Most of those who do this have some understanding  of the relationship
          between magic  and this area  of science.   To put  it very simply,  a
          successful  magical  act causes  an  apparently  acausal  result.   In
          studying  turbulence, chaos  scientists have realized  that apparently
          acausal phenomena in nature are not  only the norm, but are measurable
          by  simple mathematical equations.  Irregularity is the  stuff life is
          made  of.    For  example,  in  the  study  of  heartbeat rhythms  and
          brain-wave  patterns, irregular  patterns are  measured from  normally
          functioning  organs,  while  steady,  regular patterns  are  a  direct
          symptom of a heart attack about to occur, or an epileptic fit.

            Referring  back  again to  "virtual"  photons,  a properly  executed
          magical
          release  of  energy   creates  a  "wave  form"   (visible  by  Kirlian
          photography) around  the magician  causing turbulence in  the aetheric
          space.  This turbulence will likely  cause a result, preferably as the
          magician has intended.  Once the energy is  released, control over the
          phenomena is out  of the magician's  hands, just as once  the equation
          has been  fed into the computer,  the design follows the  path set for
          it.

             The scientists who are working in this area would scoff at this
          explanation,  they have  no  idea that  they  are  in the  process  of
          discovering the physics  behind magic.   But then,  many common  place
          sciences of today, chemistry  for example, were once considered  to be
          magic.  Understanding this  subject requires, besides some reading,  a
          shift in  thinking.   We are  trained from  an early  age to think  in
          linear terms, but nature and  the chaos within it are non-linear,  and
          therefore  require non-linear thinking to be  understood.  This sounds
          simple, yet it reminds  me of a logic class I had in college.  We were
          doing simple Aristotelian  syllogisms.  All  we had to  do was to  put
          everyday language into equation form.  It sounds simple,and it is.

            However,  it requires  a non-linear  thought process.   During  that
          lesson
          over  the space  of  a  week, the  class  size dropped  from  48 to  9
          students.

           The computer programmers were the first to drop out.  Those of us
          who survived  that section went on  to earn high grades  in the class,
          but more importantly, found that we had achieved a permanent change in
          our thinking  processes.  Our  lives were changed  by that one  simple
          shift of perspective.

             Chaos science is still in the process of discovery, yet magicians
          have been  applying its principles for  at least as long  as they have
          been writing about  magic.  Once the principles  of this science begin
          to take  hold on the thinking  process, the magician  begins to notice
          everything  from the fractal patterns in smoke rising from a cigarette
          to  the patterns  of success  and failure  in magical  workings, which
          leads to an understanding of why it has succeeded or failed.  There is
          a diagram of a fractal design on the cover of `Kaos' magazine #11 (now
          out  of print) that would be a wonderful  example of magic at work and
          the many paths that the energy may follow...

          Defining Chaos Magic
          *
             Chaos is not in itself, a system or philosophy.  It is rather an
          attitude that  one applies to one's  magic and philosophy.   It is the
          basis for  all magic,  as it is  the primal creative  force.   A Chaos
          Magician  learns a variety of  magical techniques, usually  as many as
          s/he can gain access to, but sees beyond the systems and dogmas to the
          physics  behind  the  magical  force  and  uses  whatever  methods are
          appealing to him/herself.
          Chaos does  not come with a specific Grimoire or even a prescribed set
          of
          ethics.  For  this reason, it has been dubbed "left hand path" by some
          who
          choose not to  understand that which is beyond  their own chosen path.
          There is  no set of specific  spells that are considered  to be `Chaos
          Magic spells'.  A Chaos Magician will use the same  spells as those of
          other paths, or those of his/ her own making.  Any and all methods and
          information  are  valid,  the  only  requirement  is  that  it  works.
          Mastering the role of the sub- conscious mind in magical operations is
          the  crux of it, and the state  called "vacuity" by Austin Osman Spare
          is the road to that end.  Anyone who  has participated in a successful
          ritual  has  experienced some  degree of  the  `high' that  this state
          induces.

             An understanding of the scientific principles behind magic does
          not  necessarily  require a  college  degree in  physics  (although it
          wouldn't  hurt much, if the  linear attitude drilled  into the student
          could  be by-passed),  experience in  magical results  will bring  the
          necessary understanding.

             This series is directed toward the increasing numbers of people
          who have been asking, "What is Chaos Magic?"   It is very basic and by
          no means intended to be a complete explanation of any  of the elements
          discussed.  Many of  the principles of magic must  be self-discovered,
          my  only intent here is to try to define and pull together the various
          elements  associated with Chaos Magic into an intelligible whole.  For
          those who  wish to learn  more about this  subject, I have  prepared a
          suggested reading list for the last section, however, I must emphasize
          that there are always more sources than any one person knows about, so
          do not limit yourself to this list.  Chaos has no limits...

               Notes on the role of the historical Egregore in modern Magic 
                                      by Fra.: U.D. 
           
          It is quite easy to poke fun at the historical claims of most 
          magical  and mystical  orders, especially  when they  purport to  have
          derived from "very ancient",  possible even "Atlantean" or, to  top it
          all, "pre-Atlantean" brotherhoods for whose existence even the most 
          sympathetic historical scholar worth his name would be very hard 
          pressed to find any significant proof. Actually, it is rather a 
          cheap joke to cite, for example, AMORC`s claims that even good old 
          Socrates or Ramses II (of all people!) were "Rosicrucians". However, 
          the trouble only starts when adepts mistake these contentions for 
          _literal_ truths. "Literal", of course, derives from literacy and 
          the letters of the alphabet. And, as Marshall MacLuhan has justly in 
          his "Understanding Media" and perhaps even more so in "The Gutenberg 
          Galaxy", western civilization has a 
          very strong tendency towards _linear_ thinking, very probably due to 
          - at least in part - the linear or non-pictographic nature of our 
          alphabet. The very structure of this alphabet informs us at quite a 
          tender age to think in terms of linear logics such as cause and 
          effect, or, more interestingly in our context, PAST-PRESENT-FUTURE. 
          This is not at all a "natural necessity" as most people are wont to 
          think, for the ideographic or pictographic "alphabets" as used for 
          example in ancient Egypt or even modern China and Japan tend to bias 
          the correspondingly acculturalised mind towards what MacLuhan terms 
          "iconic thinking" - a perception of holistic factors rather than 
          the systematization into separate (preferably indivisible) single 
          units. Western thought has formulated this problem as the dichotomy 
          of the _analytic_ and the _synthetic_ approach. But it is perhaps no 
          coincidence that our contemporary culture tends to associate 
          "synthetic" with "artificial" , vide modern chemistry. 
           
          Now magical and mystical thinking is quite different; in fact it is 
          not half as interested in causality as is linear thought. Rather, it 
          strives to give us an overall, holistic view of processes within 
          our perceived space-time continuum; an overall view which includes 
          the psychology of the observer to a far stronger degree than even 
          modern physics seems to have achieved in spite of Heisenberg`s 
          uncertainty principle and Einstein`s earlier theory of relativity. 
          In other words, mythological thinking is not so much about literal 
          ("alphabetic"?) truth but rather about the "feel" of things. For 
          example, a shaman may claim that the current rain is due to the rain 
          goddess weeping because of some sad event. He might predict that her 
          phase of mourning will be over in two days` time and that the deluge 
          will then end. A Western meteorologist might possibly come to 
          similar prognoses, but he will of course indignantly deny using any 
          of "this mystic stuff" in the process. His rain goddess takes the 
          form of barometric pressure, wind velocity and direction, air 
          humidity and the like - but who is to say which view is the "truer" 
          one, as long as abstract and mystic predictions prove to be 
          accurate? From an unbiased standpoint, the modern demons "barometric 
          pressure", "wind velocity" and factors of a similar like are just as 
          abstract and mythic as the shaman`s hypothetical rain goddess - 
          especially so for us laymen who religiously follow the daily 
          indoctrination via the TV weather forecasts and satellite photograph 
          divination: all we can do is _believe_ in what the expert tells us 
          is the truth. The non-shaman in a shamanic society shares a very 
          similar fate when he has to believe simply that the rain goddess

                                                                             406

          wants to be comforted say, by a substantial donation of meat or 
          tobacco in the course of a fully fledged tribal ritual. 
           
          There _is_ an important difference however. If we accept the model 
          (strongly propagated by A.O. Spare, who was, of course, in his very 
          special manner, quite an orthodox Freudian) of magic primarily 
          taking place within the subconscious (Freud) or, less 
          ambiguous, the unconscious (Jung); and if we furthermore agree that 
          said unconscious is not only the source of personal magical energy 
          (mana, or, as I prefer to term it, _magis_) but tends to think and 
          act in symbols and images, we might come to the conclusion that our 
          shaman`s explanation may perhaps not be scientificly more 
          satisfying in Western terms, but it is surely more in accord with 
          the way our unconscious tends to perceive reality. In that sense it 
          is not only more "natural" but, one suspects, even downright 
          _healthier_ for psychic hygiene. It is, so to speak, more 
          "ecological and holistic" in terms of psychic structure. 
           
          As an aside I might mention that it is the better explanation for 
          practical magical reasons as well. For at least rain goddesses can 
          be cajoled into happiness by magical technique, ritual trance and 
          the like until they stop weeping, a task a meteorologist will hardly 
          be able to imitate. (Actually I have preferred the magic of rain 
          prevention to the more classical example of rain making because it 
          is far more relevant to our own geography and experience). 
           
          In recent years Rupert Sheldrake`s theory of morphogenetic fields has 
          raised quite a hue and cry, not only within the confines of the 
          scientific community but strangely enough among occultists too. I 
          find this latter reaction quite astonishing, because a lot of what 
          Mr. Sheldrake basically claims is nothing more than the old, not to 
          say ancient, tenet of philosophical idealism: namely that there is 
          what in both German and English is called "Zeitgeist", a form of 
          unique time-cum-thought quality, leading to surprisingly similar 
          albeit completely independent models of thought, technical 
          inventions, political truths and so on. One would rather expect the 
          people to be profoundly intrigued to be among materialist/positivist 
          biologists or physicist rather that occultists who have traded in 
          the Zeitgeist principle ever since occult thought proper as we 
          understand it arose in the Renaissance. 
          From a pragmatic point of view Mr. Sheldrake is behaving very much 
          like our meteorologist, replacing mythic explanations with 
          crypto-mythic "scientific" factors. Unfortunately, most scientific 
          scholars tend to fear a devaluation of scientific termini tecnici; 
          once they are mentioned in the wrong "context" (almost invariably 
          meaning: by "wrong" people) they are readily labelled as "non-" or 
          "pseudo-" scientific - which is, after all, precisely what happened 
          to poor Mr. Sheldrake amongst his peers in spite of all his academic 
          qualifications. This example goes to show how very much estranged 
          occultists can be from their own sources even when working with 
          them daily. 
           
          Reality too is always the reality of its description: we are marking 
          our pasts, presents and futures as we go along - and we are doing it 
          all the time, whether we are conscious of the fact or not, whether 
          we like it or not, we are constantly reinventing our personal and 
          collective space-time continuum.

          Space seems rather solid and unbudging; even magic can do very
          little it seems to overcome its buttresses of solidity and apparent
          inertia, occasional exceptions included. (May it be noted that I
          include matter in this space paradigm, because solid matter is
          usually defined by the very same factors as is space - namely width,
          length and height.)
          Time, on the other hand, is much more volatile and abstract, so much
          so in fact that it is widely considered to be basically an illusion,
          even among non-occultist laymen. And indeed in his famous novel
          "1984" George Orwell has beautifully, albeit perhaps unwillingly,
          illustrated that history is very little more than purely the
          _description of history_. (Which is why it has to be rewritten so
          often. It seems that mankind is not very happy with an "objective
          past" and prefers to dabble in "correcting" it over and again. This
          is quite an important point I shall refer to again later on.)
          History is, after all, the defining of our past own roots and our
          _present_ position within our linear space-time continuum in
          relation to past and future. Very often, unfortunately, the
          description and interpretation of history seem little more pathetic
          endeavour to obtain at least a minimum of objectivity in a basically
          chaotic universe. The expression "ordo ab chao" is more or less a
          summary of Western thought and Weltanschauung, of the issues
          straining and stressing the Western mind since ancient Greece. Chaos
          is considered "evil", order on the other hand is "good" - then the
          political philosophy, if you care to dignify it by this terms, of
          "law and order", appeals to people`s deeply rooted fears of loss of
          stability and calculability. ("Anarchy" is another widely
          misunderstood case in point.) The ontological fact that everything
          is transitory has never been particular well-received in Western
          philosophy and theology.

          Now before you get the impression that I am only trying to impose a
          typical exercise in heavyhanded Teutonic style philosophical
          rambling upon your overbusy reading mind, let me hasten to point out
          that if past, present and future are, at least in principle, totally
          subjective, we as magicians are locally perfectly free to do what we
          like with them. For the magician is a) the supreme creator of his
          own universe and b) the master of Illusion (ref. the Tarot card "The
          Magician/Juggler"). This freedom of historical choice, however, is
          seldom realized let alone actively applied by the average magician.
          Maybe one of the reasons for this has to do with the somewhat
          pathetic fact that most of us tend to live our lives in a more or
          less manner, being mild eccentrics at best, distinctly avoiding
          becoming too much over the top. There are a number of possible
          explanations for this, ranging from "every magician is just another
          guy/gal like me" to "prevention of insanity". As we deal all the
          time with insanity - i.e. extremely unorthodox states of
          consciousness by bourgeois standards, we magicians prefer some
          stability in our everyday lives and makeups, but this is not really
          our topic.

          Rather than delve into social normality of the average magician I
          should like to investigate the many bogus claims to antiquity as put
          forward by a multiple of magical and mystical orders from this point
          of view. Such orders range from Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and
          Theosophy to such venerable institutions as the O.T.O., the Golden
          Dawn and many others. Their historical claims are usually quite

                                                                             408

          stereotyped: the spectrum covered includes Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu,
          Solomon, Moses, Dr. Faustus, St. Germain, the Gnostics, the Knight
          Templar,the Cathars, the Illuminati, the Holy Grail myth,
          prehistoric witchcraft, matriarchy, shamanism etc.

          Now it is quite common for shamans, to cite one example, to claim
          that in the good old days (usually, of course, dating back to a
          non-calibrated, non-defined time immemorial) things used to be much,
          much better. One of the more profane reasons for this contention may
          be the fact that most of these shamans have already achieved quite a
          venerable age in their trade; and don`t we all know the typical
          attitude of old crones towards modernity ? It may not sound
          particular spiritual or holy but maybe all we are seeing here is the
          primitive`s parallel to the "Now when I was in Poona with Royal
          Indian Army, young lad..." reported occasionally to be heard in some
          of today`s pubs.

          But there is more to it, I think. By calling up "bogus" ancestors
          from Moses via Solomon to Dr. Faustus and St. Germain, the magician
          not only reinvents his own history, he also is summoning up the
          egregore of these "entities" (along with all their powers and
          inhibitions of course) - or, to put into Mr. Sheldrake`s
          terminology, their morphic fields. By violating all the
          painstaking endeavors of the meticulous historian, by simply
          ignoring a number of tedious and possibly contradictory facts and
          questions (such as whether Moses and Solomon have ever _really_ been
          sorcerers of some standing in their own time) the magician becomes
          God in the fullest sense of the expression: not only does he choose
          his relatives in spirit quite arbitrarily, he even claims the right
          to do what not even the judaeo-christian god of the old testament is
          ever described as doing, namely changing "objective past" at will.

          This type of creative historicism appeals, so it seems, very
          strongly to the unconscious mind, supplying it with a great deal of
          ideological back-up information, thus reducing its
          conscious-mind-imposed limits of "objectivity" to at least some
          modicum of superficial probability. It is only when the occultist
          mixes up the different planes of reference, when he purports to
          speak of "objective linear truth", instead of mythic or
          symbological, decidedly non-linear truth, that serious problems
          arise.This should be avoided at all costs in order not to strain our
          psychic set-up by contradictory evidence, which can easily result in
          an unwilled-for neutralization of all magic powers.

          But this, of course, is the same problem as with occult scientism.
          "Rays" are quite a convincing hypothesis to base telepathic
          experiments on, as long as you don`t try to overdefine said rays by
          epitheta such as "electromagnetic" or the like. For if you do, you
          become the victim of scientists`zealous inquisition boards. Or, as
          Oscar Wilde might have put it, it is not truth which liberates man`s
          mind but lying. (Which, again, is one of the reasons why Aleister
          Crowley entitled his magnum opus "The Book of Lies" in the first
          place...)

          Let us then resort to _creative historicism_ whenever we find it
          useful. Let us not have "historical objectivity" dictated to us by
          the powers that be. Let us accept our fuzziness of expression which
          is, after all, little more than a honest acknowledgement of the

          fact that symbols and images are always more than just a little
          ambiguous, as our dreams well prove every night. As in divination,
          it does not pay to become overprecise in magic: the more you try to
          define a spell, the higher probability of failure. It is quite easy
          to charge a working talisman quite generally "for wealth"; it is
          quite another to charge it to "obtain the sum of $347.67 on March
          13th at 4.06 p.m. in 93, Jermyn Street, 3rd floor" and still expect
          success. While the latter may strangely enough succeed occasionally,
          this is usually only the freak exception of the rule. However, by
          systematically rewriting our past in fuzzy terms, possibly eventing
          past lives and biographies for ourselves consciously or arbitrarily,
          we are fulfilling the final demand of Granddaddy Lucifer`s "non
          serviam". Let nobody impose his or her time and history parameters
          on you!

          And for practical exercise, allow your clock occasionally to be well
          in advance of your contemporaries`; let it sometimes lay behind for
          a few hours _and_ minutes (do not just change the hour hand as this
          would make it easy to recalculate into demiurge`s "real" space-time
          continuum, making you yet again its slave!) Do this to learn about
          your former ill-advised humility towards the current time paradigm -
          and about the illusory character of time and its measurement in
          general. Rewrite your personal and family history daily, invent your
          own kin and ancestors. "Problems with Mom and Dad? Pick a new
          couple!" Experiment with retroactive spells, try to heal your
          friend`s flu before he even contracted it. But do this in a playful
          spirit lest your censor should whack you for your constant
          violations of the rules of this game by again confusing the frames
          of reference. Jump from one parallel universe to the next one, never
          permit yourself to stand still and become enmeshed by Maya`s veil
          (you are supposed to be the _Master_ of illusion, remember?). And
          don`t panic: for nothing is true, everything is permitted.

          The Care and Feeding of Crystals 
          by Matrika 
          co-sysop of PAN - the Psychic Awareness Network 
           
          Crystals  have been in the  lime-light ever since  celebrities such as
          Shirley Mcleane and Cher have come out of the closet and admitted they
          were  "New-Agers".  However, along with this public scrutiny, has also
          been  a whole bunch  of misconceptions.   The most common  of which is
          that a person just wears  a crystal like jewelry or carries  it and it
          works  like  some kind  of  instant  stage-magic or  prestidigitation.
          This, of course,  is not the case.  To get the full effect of "Crystal
          Power" in  your life means,  as with so  much else, that you  must put
          into it what you take out of it.  So here are a few  simple guidelines
          for those of you who plan on taking this subject seriously. 
           
          1.  Selecting your Crystal 
          To select  a Crystal is not  all that much different  from selecting a
          pet or a  work of art.   When you go into  the store to purchase  your
          crystal - or  any other stone used  in healing or Psychic  work - just
          pick the one that "calls" to you.  Handle the various stones and place
          them, one by one, in  your receptive hand.  (the one that  is not your
          dominant  hand;  if  you   are  right-handed  or  ambi-dextrous,  your
          receptive hand is your  left.  If you are completely  left-handed your
          receptive hand  is your right.)  The stone  that is right FOR YOU will
          "pull" you to it.  This may  not be the stone that looks the  clearest
          or the most impressive, either.  Our societies materialistic values 
          and our conditioning to  accept them must not enter into our decision,
          which is very hard for most of us at first.  Our first tendency  is to
          judge the stone -as we always judge ourselves and everything else in a
          constant  stream  of thoughts-  by what  we  have been  conditioned to
          believe is "good" or "bad". 
            
          If  the piece  you are choosing  is for  a specific  purpose; i.e. for
          healing, or to enhance  your psychic abilities, or for  meditation; it
          will help if you keep that purpose in mind while you are selecting the
          stone.  An interesting phenomena often happens to people who are  just
          going into the  gem and mineral healing or psychic  work.  Most people
          start off with  clear quartz,  because it has  the most  applications.
          They go into a store or a gem show to purchase a clear quartz and find
          themselves drawn to all kinds of other "rocks" (as the collectors call
          them) too.  Many times  they bring a bag of various  mineral specimens
          home with them.  Later they look up the stones in one of the many
          reference books  on this  subject, only to  find the stones  they were
          drawn to  are  exactly the  ones  they need  to  deal with  issues  or
          illnesses that they need to work on. 
           
          The very first thing you need to do when you first get a crystal is to
          "clear it" from the imbalanced energies of anyone else who has touched
          it.     Crystals  "work"  because  of   their  piezoelectrical  field.
          Researchers in Kirlian photography and  other subjects have long shown
          us  that the  body  is  surrounded  by  a  field  of  electro-magnetic
          energies, which psychics call the AURA.  People who have  studied this
          subject  tell   us   that  Crystals   help   us  by   attuning   their
          piezoelectrical  charge to the charge of our  auras.  So we must first
          remove the charges  from the stone that come from  other's handling of
          it.   This  is done  by leaving  the stone  in sea-salt  (available at
          almost any health-food store) for 3 days.  The only time you will have
          to use  this technique -  which is drastic -  to cleanse the  stone is

                                                                             413

          when you  first buy it.  The reason I  say the technique is drastic is
          because it erases ALL of your energy from the stone too, so  the stone
          has  to be rebonded.  (explained later) This piezoelectrical effect of
          the  stone is  the  same  reason  that  quartz  is  useful  in  making
          computers, telephones, watches, and in other electronic devices. 
           
          2.  the regular maintenance of your stone 
           
          The regular care and maintenance of your stone is really quite simple.
          First of all a gentler method of clearing the piece should be used  at
          least once a week and after any uses in either physical or inner 
          (mental/emotional/spiritual)  healing  work.    This can  be  done  in
          several  ways.  First of all, you can  run it under COOL - no extremes
          of temperature PLEASE - water in your sink for several minutes,  while
          visualizing (intensely imagining in vivid detail, from a meditative or
          extremely  relaxed state) all imbalanced energies leaving it.  You can
          also  leave  it  in  mugwort  (an herb)  for  2-3  days  buried  it in
          carefully.   You  can also  place it  in a  flowerpot with  an african
          violet plant, but you should know that if it has been used to heal any
          severe  conditions, the  plant will  die.  The  stones should  also be
          re-charged  about once a month or after  every use.  For other stones,
          direct sunlight is  not such a  good idea as it  can fade the  colors.
          You can  get the reflected  energy of the  sun by placing  them in the
          moonlight during the waxing of  the moon.  (from one day after the new
          moon through the  night of the full moon)  They can also be charged by
          surrounding them in a circle  of quartz points that have  been charged
          by  the sun, with the points of  the crystals facing inward toward the
          stones being  charged.  Another method  is to purchase an  amethyst or
          quartz cluster and place  the stones on it.   A cluster is a  specimen
          with several individual  crystals on it.   Oh, and  if you charge  the
          stone by  a circle  of crystals,  be sure they  have been  cleared and
          charged themselves before  using them  to charge anything  else.   The
          circle  should consist  of at least  4 points,  but 8 is  best.  These
          stones used for charging do NOT have to be large at all. 
           
          3.  Using your stones
          Stones are tools in our psychic work and, as in any other object used,
          work by focusing the mind's powers.  To get the best use out  of them,
          more than just wearing them or carrying them is required.  They should
          be  used from a  state of meditation,  while visualizing  the goals we
          wish  to accomplish  with them  - such  as healing,  increased Psychic
          perception, etc.    A good way to do this for to help you focus  and a
          self-hypnosis tape that relates to your goals and use  it.  And if you
          are using the crystals in healing, be aware that they are NOT meant to
          replace the care of a competent health  professional - but many people
          find them a useful adjunct to it.

          From: Warren Stott
          Subj: Ethics in Magick



          A local group recently sponsored a  seminar on the ethics of magick. I
          was unable  to attend  but  heard the  tapes of  the session.  Several
          people on this  echo were present and  had thoughtful things to say as
          did the  others in attendance.   I would  like to address  a few ideas
          that came up there and, of course, are  significant to all people that
          work magick.

          The  question  of  hexing came  up.  A  rousing  chorus ensued  saying
          essentially  that many folks  there felt their own ethical  model does
          not allow hexing. Initially, I put myself in that group as well.  I am
          not a  bad person, I  do not  intentionally hurt people.   After  some
          thought, though, I asked myself this question.

          If there  is a conceivable ethical situation  where I might sucker    
          punch someone, why would there not be such a time to zap them with    
          the same magnitude of magick?

          If  I punch someone when  they have no known  defense against me, I am
          opening  the  serious potential to harm them. My  punch might not hurt
          them at all, it might surprise them more than hurt them, it might hurt
          them enough that they get the message I was sending, or it might blind
          or  even kill them. I would  not know until after the  fact. If I felt
          justified in punching them, I would probably do it. If they turned and
          destroyed  me, I  would  have  to  question my  judgement  afterwards.
          Likewise if I blinded them.

          Acceptance of the karmic debt was raised as part of this justification
          cycle. By going ahead and hitting them, I tacitly or implicitly accept
          the debt.  Personal destruction or  harming the other  guy, it  is the
          same, I accept the debt by my action.

          Now where is the ethical question here?

          I have  often done things, things  as simple as saying  something in a
          certain way, that I immediately want to retract. If I hit this fellow,
          I probably  would want to take it back afterward. Is it ethical to act
          in a  fashion that given a  little thought you would  realize you will
          regret later?

          Magick works  in the same  way. Presuming the  ability to  control the
          magickal  zap to  the  relative intensity  of  the sucker  punch,  the
          results are just as unknown. So you accept the karmic debt, so you zap
          away.

          "Do what ye will" as long  as you accept the debt makes it  ethical? I
          don't think  so, I think  it is in  fact unethical to  hit or  zap the
          person. But I  might do it anyway. It is not really so much a question
          of ethics as it is a question of responsibility.

          No doubt Ollie North thinks that it is unethical to break the law. But
          he  did. No doubt  Jim Wright takes  the ethics of  public office very
          seriously,  but he is now in deep  refritos over an ethical dilemma of
          his own making.

          Shit Happens.  (For those of  you with  new babies, Doo  Doo Happens.)
          Ethics is a  model of what we would like in  the ideal.  That ideal we
          measure ourselves against. We can parade case examples all day to test
          this  conclusion but it is still unethical  to harm another. But we do
          it, both physically and magickly.

          So,   ethical  hexing,   there   is  no   such   thing.  I   caste   a
          hurt-you-this-much zap  on the intended, I have acted unethically. "An
          ye  harm none."  No disclaimer  or release  for special  situations is
          given or implied. She will see me break this, karma will see  that the
          ripples in  the pool come back  to me. All  together, She will  see me
          take responsibility, ethics be damned.

          One more  time, the chorus swells  and this time  I am sure that  I am
          part of that group. There is no ethical justification for hexing. Just
          don't piss me  off though, I might  be willing to  take responsibility
          for my actions.

                         CANDLE MAGIC

          1    One of the simplest of magical arts which comes under 
          the heading of natural magic is candle burning.  It is simple 
          because it employs little ritual and few ceremonial 
          artifacts.  The theatrical props of candle magic can be 
          purchased at any department store and its rituals can be 
          practiced in any sitting room or bedroom.

          2    Most of us have performed our first act of candle magic 
          by the time we are two years old.  Blowing out the tiny 
          candles on our first birthday cake and making a wish is pure 
          magic.  This childhood custom is based on the three magical 
          principals of concentration, will power and visualization.  
          In simple terms, the child who wants his wish to come true 
          has to concentrate (blow out the candles), visualize the end 
          result (make a wish) and hope that it will come true( will 
          power).

          3    The size and shape of the candles you use is 
          unimportant, although highly decorative, extra large, or 
          unusually shaped candles will not be suitable as these may 
          create distractions when the magician wants to concentrate on 
          the important work in hand.  Most magicians prefer to use 
          candles of standard or uniform size if possible.  Those which 
          are sold in different colors for domestic use are ideal.

          4    The candles you use for any type of magical use should 
          be virgin, that is unused.  Under no circumstances use a 
          candle which has already adorned a dinner table or been used 
          as a bedroom candle or night-light.  There is a very good 
          occult reason for not using anything but virgin materials in 
          magic.  Vibrations picked up by secondhand materials or 
          equipment may disturb your workings and negate their 
          effectiveness.

          5    Some magicians who are artistically inclined prefer to
          make their own candles for ritual and magical use.  This is a 
          very practical exercise because not only does it impregnate 
          the candle with your own personal vibrations, but the mere 
          act of making your own candle is magically potent.  
          Specialist shops sell candle wax and molds together with 
          wicks, perfumes, and other equipment.

          6    The hot wax is heated until liquid and then poured into 
          the mould through which a suitably sized wick has already 
          been threaded.  The wax is then left to cool and once is this 
          has occurred the mould is removed , leaving a perfectly formed 
          candle.  Special oil-soluble dyes and perfumes can be added 
          to the wax before the cooling process is complete to provide 
          suitable colors and scents for a particular magical ritual.  
          Craft shops which sell candlemaking supplies can also provide 
          do-it-yourself books explaining the technicalities of the art 
          to the beginner.

          7    Once you have purchased or made your ritual candle it 
          has to be oiled or 'dressed' before burning.  The purpose of 
          dressing the candle is to establish a psychic link between it 
          and the magician through a primal sensory experience.  By 
          physically touching the candle during the dressing 
          procedure, you are charging it with our own personal 
          vibrations and also concentrating the desire of your magical 
          act into the wax.  The candle is becoming an extension of the 
          magician's mental power and life energy.

          8    When you dress a candle for magical use, imagine that
          it is a psychic magnet with a North and a South pole.  Rub 
          the oil into the candle beginning at the top or North end and 
          work downwards to the half-way point.  Always brush in the 
          same direction downwards.  This process is then repeated by 
          beginning at the bottom or south end and working up to the 
          middle.

          9    The best type of oils to use for dressing candles are 
          natural ones which can be obtained quite easily.  Some occult 
          suppliers will provide candle magic oils with exotic names.  
          If the magician does not want to use these, he can select 
          suitable oils or perfumes from his own sources.  The oils 
          soluble perfumes sold by craft shops for inclusion in candles 
          can be recommended.

          10   the candles you use can be colored in accordance with 
          the following magical uses:

                   white- spirituality and peace.
                   red- health,energy,strength,courage, sexual potency.
                   pink- love affection and romance.
                   yellow- intellectualism, imagination, memory and 
                           creativity
                   green- fertility, abundance, good luck and harmony
                   blue-inspiration, occult wisdom, protection and 
                         devotion
                   purple Material wealth, higher psychic ability, 
                          spiritual power and idealism
                   silver- clairvoyance, inspiration, astral energy and 
                          intuition
                   orange- ambition. career matters and the law.

          11   If you wanted to use candle magic for healing, you would 
          select a red candle to burn.  To pass an exam, burn a yellow 
          candle, to gain esoteric knowledge burn a blue candle or for 
          material gain, burn a purple one.  It is obvious these
          colors relate to the signs of the zodiac and the planetary 
          forces.

          12   The simples form of candle magic is to write doesn't the 
          objective of your ritual on a virgin piece of paper.  You 
          can use color paper which matches the candle.  Write your 
          petition on the paper using a magical alphabet, such as 
          theban, enochian, malachain,etc.  As you write down what you 
          want to accomplish through candle magic-- a new job, healing 
          for a friend, a change of residence, a new love affair, 
          etc.-- visualize your dream coming true.  Visualize the 
          circumstances under which you might be offered a new job, 
          imagine your employer telling you that your salary has been 
          increased or conjure up a vision of your perfect love 
          partner.

          13   When you have completed writing down your petitio, 
          carefully fold up the paper in a deliberately slow fashion.  
          Place the end of the folded paper in the candle flame and set 
          light to it.  As you do this concentrate once more on what 
          you want from life.

          14   When you have completed your ritual, allow the candle to 
          have completely burned away.  You do not need to stay with 
          the candle after the ritual, but make sure that is safe 
          and that red-hot wax will not cause damage or fire.  Never 
          re-use a candle which has been lit in any magical ritual.  IT 
          should only be used in that ritual and then allowed to burn 
          away or be disposed of afterwards.

          15   If you are conducting a magical ritual which involves 
          two people (e.g. an absent healing for a person some distance 
          away) then the  second person can be symbolically 
          represented during the ritual by another candle.  /all you 
          need to do is find out the subject's birth date and burn the 
          appropriate candle for that zodiacal sign.  These are as 
          follows-

                                    Elemental Cauldrons 

                Using a cauldron, symbol of inspiration and rebirth, has brought
          new dimensions  to both group and solitary work.  A cauldron decorates
          the  center of the Circle during Lesser Sabbats.  An air cauldron at a
          spring rite  creates a misty,  magical quality  for the ceremony.   In
          summer, the  cauldron  will flash  and  spark.   A  blue  flame  burns
          mysteriously  within the  Water cauldron  during the  autumn festival.
          Throughout  Yule, the  Earth  cauldron burns  steadfast and  constant.
          During moon  rites, when magick is  done, we write the  purpose of our
          working on flash papers and toss  them into the burning cauldron while
          chanting.
                A  working cauldron should be of cast iron, with a tight-fitting
          lid,  three sturdy legs,  and a strong  handle.  Season  your cauldron
          before using it for the first time.  Pour in generous helping  of salt
          and lighter fluid, slosh it  up to the rim  and wipe dry.  For  indoor
          use it  MUST have a  fireproof base  or your workings  will summon  up
          yellow-coated salamander spirits from the fire department.

          EARTH Cauldron

                Layer salt, wax shavings, three powered or ground herbs, fighter
          fluid and ivy leaves in the cauldron while focus and chanting.  Use  a
          candle to light  it.  When  the smoke starts  to roll, extinguish  the
          cauldron by putting the lid on.

          AIR Cauldron

                Using tongs, put a  chunk of dry ice is a small glass or ceramic
          bowl  and place the  bowl on  a cloth in  the bottom of  the cauldron.
          Allow the  cauldron to  smoke as  long as the  ice lasts.   The  mists
          create excellent images for scrying.

          FIRE Cauldron

                Cover theinside bottom with dirtor sand to dissipateheat.  Light
          incense  charcoal and  add either salt  petter for flame  and spark or
          flash powder for  a different  but spectacular effect.   To assist  in
          releasing or firing off peak energy, try using flash "bombs".   Make a
          small pocket in a piece of flash paper, fill with flash powder and tie
          with  thread.  The  "bomb" should be  about the size  of your smallest
          fingernail.  The results  are spectacularly bright, so use  the powder
          sparingly.  Don't look directly at the flash as you drop the "bomb" in
          the cauldron.

                At least seven days before the ritual, place equal quantities of
          three appropriate herbs in a pint glass jar.  Fill the rest of the jar
          with Everclear  (200 proof  alcohol),  cap tightly,  and shake  gently
          while concentrating on the purpose of the ritual.   Add a chant if its
          feels right.   Let the jar rest  in a dark, warm spot  and shake twice
          daily,  charging with purpose.   Before the ritual,  place a fireproof
          ceramic or  glass bowl  in the  cauldron.  Pour  in the  herb mixture,
          being careful none spills into  the cauldron.  Light with a  candle to
          produce a beautiful blue flame.

                The  cauldron,   as  the  fifth   elemental  spirit,  symbolizes
          inspiration,  rebirth,  illumination and  rejuvenation.    Use a  Fire
          cauldron  with salt petter to cast a Circle.   Use the mists of an Air
          cauldron  for an initiation.   Burn away hate,  prejudice and negative
          self-images, with a Water cauldron.   The Earth cauldron is  ideal for
          indoor Beltane rites.
                Remember to  place a  burning cauldron on  a fireproof  surface.

                  The following concordance isbased on 'Gods and FightingMen' by
          Lady Augusta Gregory, first published in 1904.  Page number references
          are to the  1976 trade  paperback edition published  by the  MacMillan
          Company of Canada Limited.  Brief supplementary material is taken from
          'Dictionary of Irish Myth  and Legend' by Ronan Coghlan,  published in
          1979 by Donard  Publishing Comapany,  and referenced as  'DIM' in  the
          following text. 
           
                  As this is intendedto be a concordanceof the Irishmythological
          cycle only (as opposed to heroic, legendary, or historical  material),
          references  are limited  to Part  I, Books  I -  V, of  Lady Gregory's
          volume.   'Gods and Fighting Men' was selected as the primary text for
          this  concordance  because   it  represents  the  most   comprehensive
          synthesis of variant sources (both published and oral)  ever attempted
          as a continuous narrative of Irish  mythology.  Lady Gregory lists her
          published sources as follows:
