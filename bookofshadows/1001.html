                                                                            1001

      
       7- In  the Middle Ages, priests actually said "Masses"  to impose death  
     spells on humans. Is  such ritual being practiced today? We will probably  
     never know, because  secrecy in such groups would be assumed  as * very *  
     tight.  As  so many law-enforcement  officers seem to  be Christian, and   
     many of  the European governments  are enthralled by this  cult, we will   
     probably * never * be able to find out the truth of this. 

       8- At  every  Christian  service, donations  from  the membership  is    
     encouraged,   and,  as  most  such   donations  are  done   publically,    
     "peer-pressure"  to give  large amounts  of money  is very  high, and  a   
     feeling  of guilt  over  * not  * contributing  could lead  to psychotic   
     episodes!   The  cult's attitude  towards sexual  feelings, that  even *   
     looking *  at a  person with  even the  tiniest feeling  of "lust" is  a   
     "sin," is so  rigid as  to exclude at  least 99  percent of the  World's   
     population  from  "Heaven"  and thereby  lead  to  irreconcilable  guilt   
     feelings on the part  of the "sinners!"   Could it  be that many  of the   
     modern  world's psychiatric problems can be traced to the beliefs of this  
     cult? 
      
      9- The intolerant behaviour of Christianity is also well-documented in  
        history, with its pogroms of Jews, burning of witches, Crusades against 
           Islam,culture destruction and outrightgenocide in thePacific islands 
       and Central and South America, and hatred of anything that is not  
        "Christian." This has even extended to disruption of non-Christian  
           religious services,  and violent behaviour that is touted as simple  
     "civil disobedience."   Can such  past behaviour repeat  itself? History   
     shows it does. 
      
      10- Proselytization, or the "conversion" of new members to the cult, is 
         carried on in any number of ways, both with subtle blandishments and 
         by outright fear and threats. To watch and listen to some
             street-preachers is aneducation inthe useof fear-inducingtechnique,
           and also of individual and mass hysteria similar to that inducedby   
     Adolf Hitler and Joseph  Goebells!  Why do these preachers do their best   
     to induce such mass hysteria? One could ask the same  question about Hitler
     and Goebells, and maybe get the same answer!

      If your child, or a member of your family, is involved with this 
      cult, * please * seek help NOW!

                        Contemporarysociety isexperiencingaresurgence ofinterest
          in earth-  and nature-centered spirituality. Modern Paganism is a rich
          and  diverse  religious movement  drawing the attention  of the media,
          law-makers, and  spiritual  seekers. This pamphlet attempts  to answer
          some of the questions  frequently asked about modern Pagan beliefs and
          practices.

          What is Paganism?
                        Theterm"Pagan" comesfrom aLatinword for"country dweller"
          first  used  in  early  Christian  times to  refer  to  those  not yet
          converted to Christianity. "Pagan" was an epithet that cast aspersions
          on those  not seen as  "true believers." Today, it refers more general
          to the  faith of those whose  spiritual  center is drawn to native and
          natural religions,  usually pantheistic   or polytheistic,  and almost
          always earth-centered.

          What then is "Modern Paganism"?
                        ModernPaganism,orNeo-Paganism, isamodern, Earth-centered
          religious   perspective  which borrows  and adapts  from pre-Christian
          paganism  as  well  as   from  contemporary  religious  thought. While
          reconnecting with ancient wisdom,   it speaks eloquently to  the needs
          and concerns of the present.

          What is meant by "The Old Religion"?
                        The term describes the pre-Christian religion of much of
          western  and northern  Europe,  which was  based  on the  agricultural
          cycles  and  other natural  rhythms of  the  Earth. It  coexisted with
          Christianity for centuries,  from the so-called  "Dark Ages" up  until
          the  Inquisition and  the "Burning  Times" (witch  hunts) of  the late
          Middle Ages. It also can refer more generally to other 
          native and tribal religions of the world.

          What is the difference between Paganism and Witchcraft?
                        SomecontemporaryPagans callthemselvesWitches.The termhas
          many   meanings,  some   carrying   rather  heavy   negative  baggage.
          "Witchcraft"  or "The Craft" is  most properly applied  to three broad
          categories: Descendants of  the European witches  of the Middle  Ages,
          practitioners of  the "reconstructed" Witchcraft of  the 20th century,
          and  "feminist Witches"  whose  religion and  politics  center in  the
          contemporary womens'  spirituality movement. It can  generally be said
          that  all modern  Witches are Pagans,  but not  all modern  Pagans are
          Witches. At least one writer,  Aidan Kelly, has begun to use  the term
          "Neo-Pagan  Witchcraft"  to  describe   the  largest  portion  of  the
          contemporary Pagan community.

          What is meant by the term "Wicca"?
                        Oftenused asa synonymfor Witchcraft,"Wicca" isthought to
          derive from an Anglo-Saxon root meaning to bend or to turn. It is more
          properly applied only to  those Witchcraft traditions which originated
          in or derive from  practices in the British Isles.

          What about Shamanism?
                        Shamanismisnot areligion, butaset ofspiritual techniques
          used for  healing and the acquisition of knowledge through forays into
          non-ordinary  states     of  consciousness.  Now   gaining  increasing
          attention  in the counseling   profession, this  journeying is usually
          aided by sonic driving  (such as repetitive drumming or  chanting) and
          often involves interactions with totemic and archetypal figures. These
          techniques are used in  virtually every tribal society and  are widely
          used by contemporary Pagans.

          What do modern Pagans believe?
                        The centralbeliefs ofmodern Pagansdiffer in specificsyet
          share  many   fundamentals.  Deity is  seen  as immanent  rather  than
          transcendent.   Experience  is preferred over doctrine. It is believed
          that there are and should be   multiple paths to the Divine. There  is
          no prescribed creed, but there are a  number of beliefs shared by most
          contemporary Pagans, summarized at the end of  this pamphlet.

          Isn't this just Humanism by another name?
                        Noand Yes.Likereligious Humanists,modernPagans havealove
          and reverence for  this world  and the physical  plane generally.  The
          rational is  seen as important. Great  emphasis is also placed  on the
          intuitive, however, and the belief that the  physical and non-physical
          worlds  are equally  real, and   are  interconnected, interpenetrating
          manifestations  of nature.  This means  that  spiritual  work, whether
          called  meditation, prayer,  or  magic, and  whether  done as  ritual,
          worship, or celebration, is  efficacious and can result in  changes in
          the  physical  world.  The majority  of  Pagans  also  believe in  the
          survival of the consciousness or soul after physical death.

          How do modern Pagans worship? 
                        Some groups have formalworship services or similar group
          meetings.  Others  conduct rituals  that have varying  degrees of  set
          forms. Some Pagans worship  by themselves without formal ritual.  Most
          contemporary Pagans hold  rituals corresponding to the  turning of the
          seasons  and the phases of the moon.  Rituals are often performed in a
          sacred space defined by the demarcation  of a circle, within which the
          celebration  and worship take place. Celebrations  include eight major
          seasonal holidays,  sometimes collectively referred to  as  "Sabbats".
          These  Sabbats, as  most  frequently observed  by  North American  and
          European  Pagans,  follow  the  agricultural cycles  of  the  northern
          temperate zone,   and include the  solstices and equinoxes  as well as
          four intermediate festivals   which fall in between, sometimes  called
          "cross-quarters," on or near the first  days of February, 
          May, August, and November. Regular public  Sabbat rituals,  reflecting
          a variety of contemporary Pagan styles, are held in many  communities.
          Rituals  may   include  meditation,  chanting,   drumming,  myth-  and
          story-telling, ritual drama, dance,  and so on. Deeper ritual  work is
          most  often practiced at private gatherings, which for many traditions
          coincide  with   the phases  of the  moon. The  work may  include more
          intense  raising  of energy,    healing work,  and  personal spiritual
          development.

          What about Satanism? 
                        Contrary   to  the  claims   of  ill-informed  Christian
          fundamentalists,  the practices of modern Pagans are in no way related
          to Satanism.  Most Pagans  do  not even  believe  Satan exists.  As  a
          profanation  of  Christian symbolism,  Satan  worship  is a  Christian
          heresy, not a Pagan religion. 
           
          Do Pagans proselytize? 
                        No,Pagansdo notproselytize.Most modernPagantraditions do
          welcome newcomers.  Most modern  Pagans also  do not  discourage other
          Pagans from  integrating other  religious and spiritual practices  and
          beliefs into their practice. 
                             WHAT CONTEMPORARY PAGANS BELIEVE 
          while there  is no set  of beliefs  shared by all  Pagans, most  would
          agree that similarities far  outweigh differences. There are  a number
          of beliefs held  by the vast majority of modern  Pagans. Some of these
          are: 
           
          1. Divinity is seen as immanent. 
           
          2. Divinity  is as likely to  manifest itself in female  as male form,
          the God or  the Goddess, in the interconnectedness of all life. 
           
          3. Multiple paths to the divine exist, as symbolized by many goddesses
          and gods.  These  are often  seen  as archetypes  or  gateways to  the
          unconscious. 
           
          4. We respect and love Mother Earth as a living being, Gaia,  of which
          we are a part. 
           
          5. The physical world,  as an emanation of the divine, is  good and to
          be enjoyed by all living beings in love and harmony. 
           
          6. Ethics and morality are based on avoidance of harm to other beings,
          including Earth as a whole, which mandates environmental activism as a
          spiritual responsibility. 
           
          7. Human interdependence implies the need for community cooperation. 
           
          8.  The  solar and  lunar  cycles  and the  cycles  of  our lives  are
          celebrated.  This  leads to the maintenance and revival of old customs
          and the creation of new  ones. 
           
          9.  A strong commitment  to personal and  planetary growth, evolution,
          and balance are vital. 
           
          10.  One's  lifestyle  must  be  consistent  with one's  beliefs.  The
          personal is political. 
           
          11. A minimum  of dogma and a maximum of  individual responsibility in
          all things are goals to strive for. Thus a healthy skepticism is to be
          fostered,   and  ideas  are  not  to   be  accepted  without  personal
          investigation of their validity. 
           
          12. Messiahs  and gurus are  to be  avoided. The mediation  of another
          being  is  unnecessary  for  an  individual  to  commune  with  Deity.
          Power-from-within is preferred to power-over. 
           
          13.  All  beings  are personal  emanations  of  the  Divine. Thou  art
          Goddess, thou art God.

                                CREED OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD 

               We believe in one only God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Creator
          of things visible  such as this world in which  our brief life passes,
          ofthings  invisible such  as the  pure spirits  which are  also called
          angels, and Creator in each man of his spiritual and immortal souls.

               We believe that his only God is absolutely one in his infinitely
          holy essence as also in all His perfections, in His omnipotence, His
          infinite knowledge, His  providence, His will and His love.   He is HE
          WHO IS, as He revealed to Moses;  and He is LOVE, as the Apostle  John
          teaches us: so that these two names, Being and Love, express ineffably
          the same divine reality of Him who has wished to make himself known to
          us,  and who  "dwelling in  light inaccessible,"  is in  himself above
          every name, above every thing, and above every created intellect.  God
          alone can give  us light  and knowledge of  this reality by  revealing
          himself as  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in whose eternal life we are
          by grace called  to share, here  below in the  obscurity of faith  and
          after  death in  eternal  light.   The  mutual bonds  which  eternally
          constitute the  Three Persons, who  are each one  and the same  Divine
          Being,  are the  blessed inmost  life of  God thrice  holy, infinitely
          beyond all  that we can  conceive in human  measure.  We  give thanks,
          however, to the Divine  Goodness that very many believers  can testify
          with us before men to the unity of God, even though they know  not the
          mystery of the Most Holy Trinity.

               We believe then in God who eternally begets the Son, in the Son,
          the Word of God, who is eternally begotten, in the Holy Spirit, the
          uncreated Person, who proceeds from the Father and the Son as their
          eternal Love.  Thus in the Three Divine Persons, COAETERNAE SIBI ET
          COAEQUALES, the  life and beatitude  of God perfectly  one superabound
          and  are consummated  in the  supreme excellence  and glory  proper to
          uncreated  Being, and always "there  should be venerated  unity in the
          Trinity and Trinity in the unity."

               We believe in our Lord Jesus Christ who is the Son of God.  He is
          the Eternal Word, born of the Father before time began, and
          consubstantial with the Father, HOMOOUSIOS  TO PATRI, and through  Him
          all things  were made.   He was  incarnate of the  Virgin Mary  by the
          power of  the Holy Spirit,  and was made  man: equal therefore  to the
          Father according to His divinity, and inferior to His Father according
          to  His humanity, and himself one, not by some impossible confusion of
          His natures, but by the unity of His person.

               He dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.  He proclaimed and
          established the Kingdom of God and made us know in Himself the Father.
          He gave us His new commandment to love one another as He loved us.  He
          taught us the way of the Beatitudes of the Gospel: poverty in spirit,
          meekness, suffering borne with patience, thirst after justice, mercy,
          purity  of heart,  will for  peace, persecution  suffered for  justice
          sake.   He suffered under Pontious Pilate,  the Lamb of God bearing on
          Himself the sins of the world, and he died for us on the Cross, saving
          us by His redeeming Blood.  He was buried, and, of His own power, rose
          the  third day, raising us by His  Resurrection to that sharing in the
          divine life which is the life of grace.  He ascended to heaven, and He
          will come again this time in glory, to judge  the living and the dead:
          each according to his merits--those who have responded to the love and
          piety of God going to eternal life, those who have refused them to the
          end going to the fire that is not extinguished.  And  His Kingdom will
          have no end.


                                                                            1006
               

                    We believe inthe Holy Spirit, who is Lord,and Giver of life,
          Who is adored and glorified together with the Father and the Son.   He
          spoke  to us  by  the  Prophets,  He  was sent  by  Christ  after  His
          Resurrection  and  His  Ascension   to  the  Father;  He  illuminates,
          vivifies, protects, and  governs the Church; He  purifies the Church's
          members  if they do not shun His  grace.  His action, which penetrates
          to  the inmost  of the soul,  enables man  to respond  to the  call of
          Jesus: BE PERFECT AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS PERFECT.

                    We believe thatMary is the Mother,who remained evera virgin,
          of the  Incarnate Word, our God  and Savior Jesus Christ,  and that by
          reason  of this  singular election,  she was  in consideration  of the
          merits  of her Son, redeemed in  a more eminent manner, preserved from
          all stain of original sin and filled  with the gift of grace more than
          all other creatures.

               Joined by a close and indissoluble bond to the Mysteries of the
          Incarnation and Redemption, the Blessed Virgin, the Immaculate, was at
          the end of her earthly life raised body and soul to heavenly glory and
          likened to her risen Son in anticipation of the future lot of all the
          just;  and we  believe that the  Blessed Mother  of God,  the New Eve,
          Mother of the  Church, continues, in her maternal role  with regard to
          Christ's members,  co-operating with  the birth  and growth  of divine
          life in the souls of the redeemed.

               We believe that in Adam all have sinned, which means that the
          original offense committed by him caused human nature, common to all
          men, to fall to a state in which it bears the consequences of that
          offense, and which is not the state in which it was at first in our
          first parents, established as  they were in holiness and  justice, and
          in which  man knew  neither evil  nor death.   It is  human nature  so
          fallen,  stripped of  the grace  that clothed  it, injured in  its own
          natural  powers  and  subjected to  the  dominion  of  death, that  is
          transmitted to all men, and it is in this sense that every man is born
          in sin.  We therefore  hold, with the Council of Trent,  that original
          sin  is  transmitted  to  human  nature,  "not  by  imitation  but  by
          propagation," and that it is thus "in each of us as his own."

               We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ, by the Sacrifice of the
          Cross,  redeemed  us  from original  sin  and  all  the personal  sins
          comitted by each  one of us, so that,  in accordance with the  word of
          the Apostle, "where sin abounded, grace did more abound."

               We believe in one baptism instituted by Our Lord Jesus Christ for
          the remission of sins.  Baptism should be administered even to little
          children who have not yet been able to be guilty of any personal sins,
          in order that, though born deprived of supernatural grace, they may be
          reborn  "of water  and the Holy  Spirit to  the divine  life in Christ
          Jesus.

               We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, built by
          Jesus Christ in that rock which is Peter.  She is the Mystical Body of
          Christ;  at   the  same  time   a  visible  society   instituted  with
          hierarchical organs, and  a spiritual community; the  Church in earth,
          the  pilgrim People  of God  here below,  and the  Church filled  with
          heavenly  blessings; the germ  and the first fruits  of the Kingdom of
          God,  through  wich the  works and  the  sufferings of  Redemption are
          continued  throughout humanhistory,  and which  looks for  its perfect
          accomplishment beyond time in glory.   In the course of time, the Lord
          Jesus formed His  Church by means of the Sacrament  emanating from His
          plenitude.  By these she makes her members participants in the mystery
          of the  Death and  Ressurection of  Christ, in the  grace of  the Holy
          Spirit who gives her life and movement.  She is therefore holy, though
          she  has sinners in her bossom, because  she herself has no other life
          but that of grace: it  is by living by  her life that her members  are
          sanctified; it is by removing themselves  from her life that they fall
          into  sins and disorders that  prevent the radiation  of her sanctity.
          This is why she suffers and  does penance for these offenses, of which
          she has the power to heal her children through the blood of Christ and
          the gift of the Holy Spirit.

                    Heiress ofthe divinepromises anddaughter ofAbraham according
          to  the  Spirit, through  that  Israel whose  Scriptures  she lovingly
          guards, and whose patriarchs and prophets she venerates;  founded upon
          the  Apostles and handing on from century to century their ever-living
          words and  their powers as pastors  in the successor of  Peter and the
          bishops  in  communion with  him;  perpetually  assisted by  the  Holy
          Spirit, she  has  the charge  of guarding,  teaching, explaining,  and
          spreading the truths which God revealed in a then veiled manner by the
          Prophets,  and fully  by  the Lord  Jesus.   We  believe  ALL THAT  IS
          CONTAINED IN  THE WORD OF  GOD WRITTEN  OR HANDED DOWN,  AND WHAT  THE
          CHURCH PROPOSES FOR BELIEF  AS DIVINELY REVEALED, WHETHER BY  A SOLEMN
          JUDGMENT OR BY THE ORDINARY AND UNIVERSAL  MAGISTERIUM.  We believe in
          the  infallibility enjoyed by the  successor of Peter  when he teaches
          ex-cathedra as pastor and  teacher of all  the faithful, and which  is
          assured also  to the  episcopal body  when it exercises  with him  the
          supreme magisterium.

                    Webelieve that theChurch founded byJesus Christand for which
          He prayed is indefectibly one in faith, worship and the bond of
          hierarchical  communion.   In  the bossom  of  this Church,  the  rich
          variety  of   liturgical  rites   and  the  legitimate   diversity  of
          theological and spiritual heritages  and special disciplines, far from
          injuring her unity, make it more manifest.

               Recognizing also the existence, outside of the organism of the
          Church  of Christ,  of numerous elements  of truth  and sanctification
          which  belong to  her  as her  own  and tend  to  Catholic unity,  and
          believing in the action of  the Holy Spirit who stirs up in the hearts
          of  the disciples of Christ love of  this unity, we entertain the hope
          that Christians  who are not yet in the full communion of the one only
          Church will one day be reunited in one flock with one only Shepherd.


                                                                            1008
          


               We believe that the Church IS NECESSARY FOR SALVATION, BECAUSE
          CHRIST WHO IS THE SOLE MEDIATOR AND WAY OF SALVATION, RENDERS HIMSELF
          PRESENT FOR US IN HIS BODY WHICH IS THE CHURCH.  But the divine design
          of salvation embraces all  men; and those WHO  WITHOUT FAULT ON  THEIR
          PART DO NOT KNOW  THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST AND  HIS CHURCH, BUT SEEK
          GOD  SINCERELY, AND UNDER  THE INFLUENCE OF  GRACE ENDEAVOR  TO DO HIS
          WILL AS RECOGNIZED  THROUGH THE PROMPTINGS OF THEIR  CONSCIENCE, they,
          in a number known only to God, can obtain salvation.

                    Webelieve that theMass, celebrated bythe priest representing
          the  person  of Christ  by virtue  of the  power received  through the
          Sacrament of  Orders, and offered by him in the name of Christ and the
          members of  His Mystical  Body, is in  true reality  the Sacrifice  of
          Calvary, rendered sacramentally  present on  our altars.   We  believe
          that as the bread  and wine consecrated by the Lord at the Last Supper
          were changed into His Body and  Blood which were to be offered  for us
          on  the Cross, likewise  the bread abd wine  consecrated by the priest
          are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ enthroned  gloriously in
          heaven, and we believe that the mysterious presence of the Lord, under
          what continues to  appear to our sense as before, is a true, real, and
          substantial presence.

               Christ cannot be thus present in this sacrament except by the
          change into His Body of the reality itself of the bread and the change
          into His  Blood of the reality  itself of the  wine, leaving unchanged
          only  the properties of the bread and  wine which our senses perceive.
          This mysterious change is very appropriately called by the Church
          TRANSUBSTANTIATION.  Every theological explanation which seeks some
          understanding of this mystery must, in order to be in accord with the
          Catholic faith, maintain that in the reality itself, independently of
          our  mind,  the  bread  and  wine  have  ceased  to  exist  after  the
          Consecration, so that it is the adorable Body and Blood of the Lord
          Jesus that from then on are really before us under the sacramental
          species of bread and wine, as the Lord willed it, in order to give
          Himself to  us as  food and  to  associate us  with the  unity of  the
          Mystical
          Body.

                    The unique and indivisible existence of the Lord glorious in
          heaven is not multiplied, but is rendered present by the  sacrament in
          the many places on earth where Mass is celebrated.  And this existence
          remains  present, after the sacrifice, in  the Blessed Sacrament which
          is,  in the tabernacle, the living heart of each of our churches.  And
          it is our very sweet duty to honor and adore in the Blessed Host which
          our  eyes see,  the  Incarnate Word  which they  cannot see,  and who,
          without leaving heaven, is made present before us.


                                                                            1009
          


               We confess that the Kingdom of God begun here below in the Church
          of Christ IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD WHOSE FORM IS PASSING, and that its
          proper growth  cannot be confounded with the progress of civilization,
          of science,  or of human technology,  but that it consists  in an ever
          more profound knowledge of the riches of Christ, an ever stronger hope
          in eternal blessings, an ever more ardent response to the Love of God,
          and an ever  more generous bestowal  of grace and holiness  among men.
          Without ceasing  to recall to her  children that THEY HAVE  NOT HERE A
          LASTING DWELLING, she also urges them to contribute, each according to
          his  vocation and  means, to  the welfare  of their  earthly city,  to
          promote  justice, peace and brotherhood  among men, to  give their aid
          freely  to   their  brothers,  especially  to  the  poorest  and  most
          unfortunate.  The deep solicitude of the Church, the spouse of Christ,
          for  the needs  of men,  for their  joys and  hopes, their  griefs and
          efforts,  is therefore  nothing  other than  her  great desire  to  be
          present to  them, in order to illuminate them with the Light of Christ
          and to gather them all in Him, their only Savior.  This solicitude can
          never mean that the Church conform herself to the things of the world,
          or that she lessen the ardor of her expectation of the Lord and of the
          eternal Kingdom.

               We believe in the life eternal.  We believe that the souls of all
          those who die in the grace of Christ, whether they must still be
          purified in Purgatory, or whether from the moment they leave their
          bodies Jesus takes them to Paradise as He did for the Good Thief, are
          the People of God in the eternity beyond death, which will be finally
          conquered on the day of the Resurrection when these souls will be
          reunited with their bodies.

               We believe that the multitude of those gathered around Jesus and
          Mary forms the Church in Heaven,  where in eternal beatitude they  see
          God  as  He  is,  and  where they  also,  in  different  degrees,  are
          associated with the holy angels in the divine rule exercised by Christ
          in glory, interceding for us  and helping us in our weakness  by their
          brotherly care.

               We believe in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those
          who  are  pilgrim  on   earth,  the  dead  who  are   attaining  their
          purification,
          and the blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church; and we
          believe that in this communion the merciful love of God and His Saints
          is ever listening to our prayers, as Jesus told us: Ask and you will
          receive.  Thus it is  with faith and in  hope that we look forward  to
          the  resurrection of  the dead,  and the  life of  the world  to come.
          Blessed be God Thrice Holy.  Amen.

                                  WORDS TO THE WISE ....

                    O daughters andsons of theEarth, adore theGoddess and Godand
          be blessed with the fullness of life.

                    Know thatThey havebrought youto thesewritings, forherein lie
          our ways of the Craft, to serve and fulfill the keepers of wisdom, the
          tenders of the sacred flame of knowledge.  Run the rites with love and
          joy, and the Goddess  and God will bless  you with all that  you need.
          But those who practice dark magicks shall know Their greatest wrath.

                    Remember thatyou are ofthe Craft. No moredo you trodthe ways
          of doubt.   You walk the  path of light, ever climbing  from shadow to
          shadow to  the  highest realm  of  existence.   But  though we're  the
          bearers of  truths, others do not  wish to share our  knowledge, so we
          run our rites beneath moon filled  skies enwrapped in shadows.  But we
          are happy.

                    Live fully, forthat is the purpose of life. Refrain not from
          earthly existence.   From it  we grow to  learn and understand,  until
          such time that we are reborn to learn more, repeating this cycle 'till
          we have spiralled  up the path of perfection and  can finally call the
          Goddess and God our kin.

                    Walk the fields andforests; be refreshedby the cool windsand
          the touch of a  nodding flower.  The Moon and Sun  sing in the ancient
          wild places:   The deserted  seashore, the stark  desert, the  roaring
          waterfall.   We are  of the Earth  and should  revere Her,  so do  Her
          honor.

                    Celebratethe riteson theappropriate daysand seasons,and call
          upon the Goddess and God when the time is meet, but use the Power only
          when necessary, never  for frivolous ends.  Know that  using the Power
          for harm is a Perversion of Life itself.

                    But for those who love and magnify love, the richness oflife
          shall be your reward.  Nature will celebrate.

               So love the Goddess and God, and harm none!

                                   THE NATURE OF OUR WAY

                    * As  often as possible, hold  the rites in  forests, by the
          seashore, on deserted mountaintops or near tranquil lakes.  If this is
          impossible, a garden  or some chamber shall suffice, if  it is readied
          with fumes of flowers.

                    *Seek outwisdom inbooks, rare manuscriptsand crypticpoems if
          you will, but seek it out also in simple stones and fragile herbs  and
          in the cries of wild birds.  Listen to the whisperings of the wind and
          the  roar of water if you  would discover magick, for  it is here that
          the old secrets are preserved.

                    * Books contain words;trees contain energies andwisdom books
          ne'er dreamt of.

                    *  Ever remember that the  Old Ways are constantly revealing
          themselves.  Therefore  be as the  river willow that  bends and  sways
          with  the wind.    That which  remains  changeless shall  outlive  its
          spirit, but that which evolves and grows will shine for centuries.

                    * Therecan be no monopolyon wisdom.  Thereforeshare what you
          will of our ways with  others who seek them, but hide mystic lore from
          the  eyes of those  who would destroy,  for to do  otherwise increases
          their destruction.

                    * Mock not the rituals or spells of another, for who can say
          yours are greater in power or wisdom?

                    *Ensure that your actions are honorable, for all that you do
          shall return to you three-fold, good or bane.

                    * Be waryof one who would dominate you,who would control and
          manipulate your  workings  and reverences.    True reverence  for  the
          Goddess  and God occurs within.  Look  with suspicion on any who would
          twist worship from you for their own gain and glory, but welcome those
          priestesses and priests who are suffused with love.

                    * Honorall living things,for we are ofthe bird, thefish, the
          bee.  Destroy not life save it be to preserve your own.

               * And this is the nature of our way.

                                      BEFORE TIME WAS

                    Beforetime was, therewas The One;The One was all,and all was
          The One.

                    Andthe vast expanseknown asthe universewas TheOne, all-wise,
          all-pervading, all-powerful, eternally changing.

                    And space moved.  The Onemolded energy into twin forms,equal
          but opposite, fashioning the Goddess  and God from The One and  of The
          One.

                    The Goddess and God stretched and gave thanks to The One,but
          darkness surrounded them.  They were alone, solitary save for The One.

                    So They formed energy  into gasses and gasses into  suns and
          planets and moons;  They sprinkled the  universe with whirling  globes
          and so all was given shape by the hands of the Goddess and God.

                    Light aroseand the sky wasilluminated by a billionsuns.  And
          the Goddess and God, satisfied by their works, rejoiced and loved, and
          were one.

                    From theirunion sprang the seedsof all life, andof the human
          race, so that we might achieve incarnation upon the Earth.

                    TheGoddess chose theMoon as Hersymbol, and theGod the Sun as
          His symbol, to remind the inhabitants of Earth of their fashioners.

                    All areborn, live, dieand are rebornbeneath the Sunand Moon;
          all things come  to pass thereunder, and all occurs with the blessings
          of The One, as has been the way of existence before time was.

                    I am the GreatMother, worshipped by all creationand existent
          prior to their consciousness.  I am the primal female force, boundless
          and eternal.

                    I am thechaste Goddessof the Moon,the Lady ofall magick. The
          winds and moving leaves sing  my name.  I wear the  crescent Moon upon
          my brow and my feet rest among the starry heavens.  I am mysteries yet
          unsolved, a path  newly set upon.  I am a field untouched by the plow.
          Rejoice in me and know the fullness of youth.

                    I amthe blessed Mother,the gracious Lady ofthe harvest. I am
          clothed with the  deep, cool wonder of the  Earth and the gold  of the
          fields heavy with grain.  By me the tides  of the Earth are ruled; all
          things  come to  fruition according  to my  reason.   I am  refuge and
          healing.  I am the life-giving Mother, wondrously fertile.

                    Worship me as theCrone, tender of the unbrokencycle of death
          and rebirth.   I am the  wheel, the shadow  of the Moon.   I rule  the
          tides of  women and men and  give release and renewal  to weary souls.
          Though the darkness  of death  is my domain,  the joy  of birth is  my
          gift.

                    I amthe Goddess of theMoon, the Earth,the Seas.  Mynames and
          strengths are  manifold.   I pour  forth magick  and power, peace  and
          wisdom.    I am  the  eternal  Maiden, Mother  of  all,  and Crone  of
          darkness, and I send you blessings of limitless love.



                                      CALL OF THE GOD

                    I am the radiant King of the Heavens, floodingthe Earth with
          warmth and encouraging the hidden seed of creation to burst forth into
          manifestation.   I lift  my shining  spear to light  the lives  of all
          beings and  daily pour forth my gold upon the Earth, putting to flight
          the powers of darkness.

                    I am the master of the beasts wild and free.  I run with the
          swift stag  and soar as  a sacred falcon  against the shimmering  sky.
          The ancient woods and wild places  emanate my powers, and the birds of
          the air sing of my sanctity.

                    I amalso the lastharvest, offering upgrain andfruits beneath
          the sickle of time so that all may be nourished.  For without planting
          there can be no harvest; without winter, no spring.

                    Worshipme as the thousand-namedSun of creation,the spirit of
          the horned stag in the wild, the  endless harvest.  See in the  yearly
          cycle of festivals my birth, death and rebirth - and know that such is
          the destiny of all creation.

                    I am the sparkof life, the radiantSun, the giver of peaceand
          rest,  and  I  send  my  rays of  blessings  to  warm  the  hearts and
          strengthen the minds of all.

                                   THE CIRCLE OF STONES

                    The Circle of stonesis used during indoor rituals,for energy
          raising, meditation and so on.

               First cleanse the area with the ritual broom.

                    For this circle you willneed four large, flat stones. If you
          have none, candles can be used to mark the four cardinal points of the
          circle.  White or purple candles can be used, as can colors related to
          each direction - green for  the North, yellow for East, red  for South
          and blue for West.

                    Placethe first stone(or candle) tothe North, torepresent the
          Spirit of  the North Stone. In  ritual when you invoke  the Spirits of
          the  Stones  you're  actually  invoking  all  that  resides   in  that
          particular direction, including the elemental energies.

                    After setting theNorth Stone(or candle), placethe East,South
          and  West  Stones.   They  should  mark  out  a rough  square,  nearly
          encompassing the working  area.  This  square represents the  physical
          plane on which we exist - the Earth.

                    Nowtake a long purpleor white cordand lay it outin a circle,
          using  the four  stones or candles  to guide you.   It takes  a bit of
          practice to smoothly do this.   The cord should be placed so  that the
          stones remain inside the circle.  Now  you have a square and a circle,
          the circle  representing the spiritual  reality.   As such, this  is a
          squared circle;  the  place of  interpenetration of  the physical  and
          spiritual realms.

                    The  size of the  circle can be  anything from 5  to 20 feet
          depending on the room and your desires.
               Next, set up the altar.  The following tools are recommended:

               * A Goddess symbol (candle, holed stone, statue)
               * A God symbol (candle, horn, acorn, statue)
               * Athame 
               * Wand
               * Censer
               * Pentacle
               * A bowl of Water (spring, rain or tap)
               * A bowl of Sea Salt (it can also be placed on the pentacle)
               * Incense
               * Flowers and greens
               * One red candle in holder (if not using point candles)
                    * Anyother tools ormaterials requiredfor the ritual,spell or
               magickal working

                    Set upthe altar accordingto theplan shown hereor accordingto
          your own design.  Also be sure to have plenty of matches, as well as a
          small  heat-proof  container in  which  to place  them  when used.   A
          charcoal block is also necessary to burn the incense.

                Water                     Candle                        Salt


                                         Pentacle

                 Cup                                                  Incense


                                         Cauldron,
                                         or Spell
               Wand                      Materials                      Knife


               Bell                                                    Boline

                                  Suggested Altar Layout


                    Light thecandles. Set theincense smoking. Lift theathame and
          touch its blade to the water, saying:

               I consecrate and cleanse this water
               that it may be purified and fit to
               dwell within the sacred Circle of Stones.
               In the name of the Mother Goddess and Father          God,
               I consecrate this water.

                    As  you do  this, visualize  your athame  blasting away  all
          negativity from the water.
                    The salt is next touched with  the point of the athame while
          saying:

               I bless this salt that it may be fit
               to dwell within the sacred Circle of Stones.
               In the name of the Mother Goddess and Father          God,
               I bless this salt.

                    Now stand facing North,at the edge of thecord-marked circle.
          Hold your athame point outward at waist level.  Walk slowly around the
          circle's perimeter clockwise, your feet just inside the cord, charging
          it  with your  words and  energy.   Create the  circle -  through your
          visualization - with the  power flowing out from your  athame's blade.
          As you walk,  stretch the energy out until it  forms a complete sphere
          around the working area, half above the ground, half below.  As you do
          this say:

               Here is the boundary of the Circle of Stones.
               Naught but love shall enter in,
               Naught but love shall emerge from within.
               Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!


                                                                            1017
               

                    When youhave arrived backat the North,place the athameon the
          altar.   Take up the salt and sprinkle it around the circle, beginning
          and ending  in  the North,  and  moving clockwise.    Next, carry  the
          smoking censer from the  altar, and finally sprinkle water  around the
          circle.    Do more  than carrying  and  walking; sense  the substances
          purifying the circle.  The Circle of Stones is now sealed.

                    Holdaloft the wand atthe North, atthe edge ofthe circle, and
          say:

               O Spirit of the North Stone,
               Ancient One of the Earth,
               I call You to attend this circle.
               Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!

                    As yousay this,visualize agreenish mistrising and writhingin
          the Northern quarter, over the stone.  This is the elemental energy of
          the Earth. When  the Spirit is  present, lower the  wand, move to  the
          East, raise it again and say:

               O Spirit of the East Stone,
               Ancient One of Air,
               I call You to attend this circle.
               Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!

                    Visualize theyellowish mistof Airenergy.  Lowerthe wand,move
          to  the  South  and repeat  the  following  with  your upraised  wand,
          visualizing a crimson Fire mist:

               O Spirit of the South Stone,
               Ancient One of Fire,
               I call You to attend this circle.
               Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!

               Finally, to the West, say with the wand held aloft:

               O Spirit of the West Stone,
               Ancient One of Water,
               I call You to attend this circle.
               Charge this by Your powers, Old Ones!

               Visualize the bluish mist, the essence of Water.
                    The circle breaths and lives around you.  The Spirits of the
          Stones are present.  Feel the  energies.  Visualize the circle glowing
          and growing in power.  Stand still, sensing for a moment.

                    The Circleof Stones is complete.  The Goddess and God may be
          called, and magick wrought.

                                     CUTTING A DOORWAY

                    At times you may have to leave the circle.  This is fine, of
          course,  but  as  previously  mentioned, passing  through  the  circle
          dissipates it.  To prevent this from occurring it's traditional to cut
          a doorway.

                    Todo this,face Northeast. Hold yourathame pointdownward near
          the ground.  See and sense the circle before  you.  Pierce its wall of
          energy with  the athame  and trace  an archway,  tall  enough to  walk
          through,  moving counter-clockwise  along the  circle for  about three
          feet.  Move the  point of the athame up at the  arch's center and down
          the other side until it is near the ground.

                    As you're doingthis, visualizethat area ofthe circle'senergy
          being sucked  back into  the athame.   This  creates a void,  allowing
          passage in and out of the circle.  Pull the athame out of the circle's
          wall.  You're free to walk outside.

                    Onceback inside, close the door by placing the athame at the
          lower North-Eastern point  of the archway.  With your athame trace the
          circle's perimeter  clockwise, as  if redrawing  that  portion of  the
          Circle  of Stones, again visualizing blue or purple energy flaring out
          from the  blade and converging  with the rest  of the  circle.  It  is
          done.



                                   RELEASING THE CIRCLE

               Once the rite is ended, face North, hold aloft the wand and say:

               Farewell, Spirit of the North Stone.
               I give thanks for your presence here.
               Go in power.

                    Repeat  this  same formula  to  the  East, South  and  West,
          substituting the proper direction  in the words.   Then return to  the
          North and hold the wand aloft for a few moments.

                    Lay the wandon the altar. Take up theathame.  Standingin the
          North,  pierce the circle's wall with the  blade at waist level.  Move
          clockwise around the circle, visualizing it's power being  sucked back
          into the  athame.  Literally pull  it back into the  blade and handle.
          Sense  the  circle dissolving,  shrinking;  the  outside world  slowly
          regaining its dominance in the area.

               When you arrive at the North again, the circle is no more.


                                                                            1019
          

                          VISUALIZATIONS FOR THE CIRCLE OF STONES

                    If  you wish, you  can back up  the circle casting  with the
          following visualizations as you form the circle itself:
                    Prepare asusual.  Approachthe Northand set theNorth Stone(or
          the candle)  on the  ground.   Then, visualize  a stone  slab standing
          upright two feet to the left of and behind the North Stone.  Visualize
          this as  being bluish-grey, two feet wide, two feet thick and six feet
          tall.  This stone represents the Goddess.

                    When thestone is really there- in your visualization- create
          another stone of the same size and  color two feet to the right of and
          behind the North Stone.  This represents the God.

                    Now visualize a capstone  resting on top of the  two upright
          stones.   It  is about  two  feet  by two  feet  by six  feet.    This
          represents The One before the Goddess and God, the source of all power
          and magick.  The Northern Trilithon is now complete.

                    Thestones form anarchway, a symbolof the gatewayto the realm
          of the element of Earth.

                    Firmlyvisualize this, then gazethrough the archformed by the
          stones.  See the greenish haze of the Earth energy.

                    Repeat the  entire procedure  to the East,  South and  West.
          Visualize the appropriate elemental color within each trilithon.

                    Now purify salt and water,cast the circle as usual, andcarry
          around the salt, censer, candle and water.

                    As youapproach each quarterto callits Spirit ofthe Stone,see
          the  trilithon firmly  in your mind.   Visualize  it in  all its Pagan
          splendor.  See the  elemental hazes within them, boiling  and writhing
          in  unmanifestedness.   Stretch  out  with  your  feelings; sense  the
          arrival of the spirit of each stone, then go on to the next.

                    With practice this comes easily, but such visualizations are
          never necessary.



          THE BLESSING CHANT

          The Blessing Chant can be said at  the beginning of any type of ritual
          as a general invocation.  Separate invocations of the  Goddess and God
          may follow.

               May the powers of The One,
               the source of all creation;
               all-pervasive, omnipotent, eternal;
               may the Goddess,
               the Lady of the Moon;
               and the God,
               Horned Hunter of the Sun;
               may the powers of the Spirits of the Stones,
               rulers of the elemental realms;
               may the powers of the stars above and the Earth below,
               bless this place, and this time, and I who am         with you.

                    Hold up a Chalice of wine (or some other liquid) betweenyour
          hands to the sky, and say:

               Gracious Goddess of Abundance,
               Bless this wine and infuse it with your              love.
               In your names, Mother Goddess and Father God,
               I bless this wine (or brew, juice, etc.).

                    Hold upa plate ofcakes (bread,biscuits) with bothhands tothe
          sky and say:

               Powerful God of the Harvest,
               Bless these cakes and infuse them with your           love.
               In your names, Mother Goddess and Father God,
               I bless these cakes (or this bread).



          CONSECRATION OF TOOLS

                    Lightthe candles. Set the incensesmoking.  Castthe Circle of
          Stones.  Place the tool on the pentacle, or a plate of salt.  Touch it
          with the point of your athame (or your projective hand) and say:

                    Iconsecrate you, O Athame of steel(or wand of wood, etc.) to
          cleanse and purify  you to serve me within  the Circle of Stones.   In
          the names of the Mother Goddess and Father God, you are consecrated.

                    Send projective  energy into the  tool, cleansing it  of all
          negativity and past  associations.  Now pick  it up and  sprinkle with
          salt, pass it through the incense  smoke, through the candle flame and
          sprinkle  with  water,  calling upon  the  Spirits  of  the Stones  to
          consecrate it.

               Then hold the tool to the sky, saying:

                    I charge youby the OldOnes: By theomnipotent Goddess andGod:
          By the virtues of the Sun, Moon and Stars: By the powers of the Earth,
          Air,  Fire and Water,  that I shall  obtain all that  I desire through
          you.  Charge this by your power, Old Ones!

                    The toolshould immediately beput touse to strengthenand bind
          the consecration.  For  example, the athame can be used  to consecrate
          another  tool; a wand to invoke the Goddess;  the pentacle to act as a
          resting place for a tool during its consecration.

          THE FULL MOON RITE

                    Perform this at night,in the view ofthe Moon if possible. It
          is appropriate  for crescents, white  flowers, silver and  other lunar
          symbols  to  be present  on the  altar for  this  ritual.   The quartz
          crystal sphere can be placed on the altar as well.  Or, if you prefer,
          use the cauldron (or a small  white or silver bowl) filled with water.
          Place a piece of silver into the water.

                    Arrangethe altar, light the candles and censer, and cast the
          Circle of Stones.

                    Stand beforethe altar andinvoke the Goddess andGod, with the
          Blessing Chant and/or  any other invocations (see  Prayers, Chants and
          Invocations in this Book of Shadows).

                    Now gaze at the Moon, ifpossible.  Feel its energies sinking
          into  your body.  Feel its cool Goddess energy wash you with power and
          love.
               Now say these or similar words:

               Wondrous Lady of the Moon
               You who greets the dusk with silvered kisses;
               Mistress of the night and of all magicks,
               who rides the clouds in blackened skies
               and spills light upon the cold Earth;
               O Lunar Goddess,
               Crescented-One,
               Shadow maker and shadow breaker;
               Revealer of mysteries past and present;
               Puller of seas and ruler of women;
               All-wise Lunar Mother,
               I greet your celestial jewel
               at the waxing of its powers
               With a rite in Your honor.
               I pray by the Moon,
               I pray by the Moon,
               I pray by the Moon.

                    Continue chanting"I pray bythe Moon"  foras long asyou will.
          Visualize  the Goddess  if you so  desire, perhaps  as a  tall, robust
          woman  wearing silver jewelry and white, rippling, draped clothing.  A
          crescent  Moon may  rest upon  Her  brow, or  She may  toss a  glowing
          silvery white orb in Her  hands.  She treads the starfield  of eternal
          night  in  an eternal  round with  Her lover,  the Sun  God, spreading
          moonrays wherever  She goes.   Her eyes laugh,  Her skin is  white and
          translucent. She glows.

                    Nowis the timefor magick ofall types, forthe full ofthe Moon
          marks the  height of its powers, and all positive spells cast then are
          powerful.

                    FullMoons arealso excellenttimesfor meditation,mirror magick
          and  psychic workings, for such  are often more  successful within the
          circle.    Crystal-scrying  is  particularly  recommended;  flood  the
          crystal with  moonlight prior to the  ritual.  If you  have no crystal
          sphere, use  the cauldron filled  with water and the  piece of silver.
          Gaze at the  water (or at the  Moon glinting on the  silver) to awaken
          your psychic awareness.

                    Lunar  liquids such as lemonade,  milk or white  wine can be
          consumed during the  simple feast  that follows.   Crescent cakes  are
          traditional as well.
               Thank the Goddess and God and release the circle.  It is done.

          YULE (circa December 21) 

                    Thealtar isadorned withevergreens suchas pine,rosemary, bay,
          juniper and cedar,  and the  same can be  laid to mark  the Circle  of
          Stones.  Dried leaves can also be placed on the altar. 

                    The cauldron, resting onthe altar on a heat-proofsurface (or
          placed before it if too large), should be filled with ignitable spirit
          (alcohol), or a red candle can be placed within it.  At outdoor rites,
          lay a fire within the cauldron to be lit during ritual. 

                    Arrange the altar, lightthe candles and incense, andcast the
          Circle of Stones. 
               Recite the Blessing Chant. 
               Invoke the Goddess and God. 
                    Stand before the cauldron  and gaze within it. Say  these or
          similar words: 
           
               I sorrow not, 
                  though the world is wrapped in sleep. 
               I sorrow not, 
                  though the icy winds blast. 
               I sorrow not, 
                  though the snow falls hard and deep. 
               I sorrow not, 
                  this too shall soon be past. 
           
                    Ignitethe cauldron (or candle),using long matchesor a taper.
          As the flame(s) leap up say: 
           
               I light this fire in Your honor, 
                  Mother Goddess 
               You have created life from death; 
                  warmth from cold; 
                  The Sun lives once again; 
                  the time of light is waxing. 
               Welcome, 
                  ever-returning God of the Sun! 
               Hail Mother of All! 
           
                    Circle the altar andcauldron slowly, clockwise, watching the
          flames.  Say the following chant for some time: 
           
               The wheel turns; the power burns. 
           
                    Meditate upon the Sun,on the hidden energies lyingdormant in
          winter, not  only in the Earth  but within ourselves.   Think of birth
          not as the start  of life but as its continuance.   Welcome the return
          of the God. 


                                                                            1023
               

                    After a time cease and stand once again before the altar and
          flaming caldron.  Say: 
           
               Great God of the Sun, 
                  I welcome Your return. 
               May You shine brightly upon the Goddess; 
                  may You shine brightly upon the Earth, 
                  scattering seeds and fertilizing the land. 
               All blessings upon You, 
                  reborn One of the Sun! 
           
               Works of magick, if necessary, may follow. 
               Celebrate the Simple Feast. 
               The circle is released.  
          YULE LORE 
           
                    Onetraditional Yuletidepractice isthe creationof aYule tree.
          This  can be a living,  potted tree which can later  be planter in the
          ground, or a cut one.  The choice is yours. 

                    Appropriate Pagandecorations are fun to make,from strings of
          dried rosebuds  and cinnamon sticks  (or popcorn and  cranberries) for
          garlands,  to  bags of  fragrant spices  which  are hung  from boughs.
          Quartz  crystals can  be wrapped  with shiny  wire and  suspended from
          sturdy  branches to  resemble  icicles.   Apples,  oranges and  lemons
          hanging from boughs are strikingly beautiful, natural decorations, and
          were customary in ancient times. 

                    Many enjoy the custom of  lighting the Yule log.  This  is a
          graphic representation of  the rebirth  of the God  within the  sacred
          fire of  the Mother  Goddess.   If you choose  to burn  one, select  a
          proper log (traditionally of oak or pine).  Carve or chalk a figure of
          the Sun (such as a rayed disc) or the God (a horned circle or a figure
          of a man) upon it, with the Boline, and set it alight in the fireplace
          at dusk on Yule.   As the log burns, visualize the  Sun shining within
          it and think of the coming warmer days. 

                    As to food, nuts,  fruits such as apples and pears, cakes of
          caraways  soaked   in  cider,  and  (for   non-vegetarians)  pork  are
          traditional fare.  Wassail, lambswool, hibiscus or ginger tea and fine
          drinks for the Simple Feast or Yule Meals.

          placed  on the altar.  An orange  candle anointed with musk, cinnamon,
          frankincense or rosemary  oil, unlit, should also be there.   Snow can
          be melted and used for the water during the circle casting.

               Say such words as the following: 
           
               This is the time of the feast of torches, 
                  when every lamp blazes and shines 
                  to welcome the rebirth of the God. 
               I celebrate the Goddess, 
                  I celebrate the God; 
                  all Earth celebrates 
                  Beneath its mantle of sleep. 
           
                    Light the orange taper fromthe red candle on the altar(or at
          the Southern point of the circle).  Slowly walk  the circle clockwise,
          bearing the candle before you.  Say these or similar words: 
           
               All the land is wrapped in winter. 
               The air is chilled and frost envelops the Earth. 
               But Lord of the Sun, 
                  Horned One of animals and wild places, 
                  unseen you have been reborn of the gracious Mother Goddess, 
               Lady of all fertility. 
               Hail Great God! 
               Hail and welcome! 
           
                    Stop before the altar, holding aloft the candle.  Gaze atits
          flame.  Visualize  your life blossoming with  creativity, with renewed
          energy and strength. 

                    If you need to look into the future or past, now is an ideal
          time.

          light every lamp in the house - if only for a few moments.   Or, light
          candles in  each room  in honor  of the  Sun's rebirth.   Alternately,
          light a kerosene lamp with a red chimney and place this in a prominent
          part of the home or in a window. 

                    If snow lies on the ground outside, walk in it for a moment,
          recalling the warmth  of summer.  With your projective  hand, trace an
          image of the Sun on the snow.

                    Foods  appropriate to eat on this day include those from the
          dairy, since Imbolc marks the festival of calving.   Sour cream dishes
          are fine.  Spicy and full-bodied foods in honor of the Sun are equally
          attuned.  Curries  and all  dishes made with  peppers, onions,  leeks,
          shallots, garlic or chives  are appropriate.  Spiced wines  and dishes
          containing  raisins  - all  foods  symbolic  of  the  Sun -  are  also
          traditional.

               Invoke the Goddess and God in whatever words please you. 
               Stand before the altar and gaze upon the plant as you say: 
           
               O Great Goddess, 
                  you have freed yourself from the icy prison of winter. 
               Now is the greening, 
                  when the fragrance of flowers drifts on the breeze. 
               This is the  beginning. 
               Life renews itself by Your magick, 
                  the Earth Goddess. 
               The God stretches and rises, 
                 eager in His youth, 
                 and bursting with the promise of summer. 
           
                    Touch theplant. Connect with itsenergies and, throughit, all

          -  from  the center  of your  consciousness out  through your  arm and
          fingers and  into the plant  itself.  Explore its  inner nature; sense
          the miraculous processes of life at work within it. 

               After a time, still touching the plant, say: 
           
               I walk the Earth in friendship, 
                  not in dominance.

          chosen reveal your inner thoughts and emotions.

          ride)  through gardens,  a  park, woodlands,  forest  and other  green
          places.  This  is not simply exercise,  and you should be  on no other
          mission.  It  isn't even just  an appreciation of  nature.  Make  your
          walk celebratory, a ritual for nature itself. 

                    Other traditionalactivities include plantingseeds, workingon
          magickal gardens and  practicing all  forms of herb  work -  magickal,
          medicinal, cosmetic, culinary and artistic. 

                    Foods intune with thisday (linkingyour meals withthe seasons
          is a  fine way of attuning  with nature) include those  made of seeds,
          such as  sunflower, pumpkin and  sesame seeds, as  well as  pine nuts.
          Sprouts  are  equally appropriate,  as  are  leafy, green  vegetables.
          Flower dishes such  as stuffed nasturtiums or carnation  cupcakes also
          find  their place here. [Find a book  of flower cooking or simply make
          spice cupcakes.   Ice with pink  frosting and place a  fresh carnation
          petal on each cupcake.  Stuff nasturtium blossoms  with a mixture made
          with cream cheese, chopped nuts, chives and watercress.]

          BELTANE LORE 
           
                    Weavingand plaiting are traditionalarts at thistime of year,
          for the joining together  of two substances to form a third  is in the
          spirit of Beltane. 

                    Foods traditionally come from the dairy, and dishes such  as
          marigold custard (see recipes - food)  and vanilla ice cream are fine.
          Oatmeal cakes are also appropriate. 
           
           
           
          MIDSUMMER (circa June 21) 
           
                    Before the rite, make upa small cloth pouch filled withherbs
          such as  lavender, chamomile, St. John's Wort,  vervain, or any of the
          Midsummer herbs listed  in "An  Herbal Grimoire."   Mentally pour  all
          your troubles,  problems, pains, sorrows  and illnesses, if  any, into
          this petition as  you construct it.   Tie it  shut with a red  string.
          Place this on  the altar for use during the rite.  The cauldron should
          also  be  there or  nearby.   Even  if  you  use candles  to  mark the
          quarters, the red candle in a holder should also be on the altar.  For
          outdoor rituals,  light a fire  - however small  - and drop  the pouch
          into this. 

                    Arrangethe altar, light the candles and censer, and cast the
          Circle of Stones. 
               Recite the Blessing Chant. 
               Invoke the Goddess and God. 
               Stand before the altar and say, with wand upraised: 
           
               I celebrate the noon of summer with mystic rites.

                  burn away the unuseful, 
                  the hurtful,

          When it is burning drop it into the cauldron (or some other heat-proof
          container) and say: 
           
           
               I banish you by the powers of the Goddess and         God!

          enchanted night air. 
               I give thanks.

          powers  of nature flowing through  you, washing you  clean with divine
          energy.

          MIDSUMMER LORE 
           
                    Midsummeris practically theclassic time toperform magicks of
          all  kinds.   Healings,  love  magick and  protections  are especially
          suitable.    Herbs  can  be  dried  over  the ritual  fire  if  you're
          celebrating  outdoors.   Leap the  fire for  purification and  renewed
          energy. 

               Fresh fruits are standard fare for Midsummer.

          present there as well.

               Invoke the Goddess and God. 
                    Stand before the altar, holding aloft the  sheaves of grain,
          saying these or similar words: 
           
               Now is the time of the First Harvest, 
                          when thebounties ofnaturegive ofthemselvesso thatwemay

               O God of the ripening fields,

                          grant methe understanding ofsacrifice as Youprepare to

                    Rub theheads of the wheatwith your fingers sothat the grains
          fall onto the altar.  Lift a piece of fruit and  bite it, savoring its
          flavour, and say:

                  I offer my thanks for the continuing fertility of the Earth. 
                    May the nodding grain  loose its seeds  to be buried in  the
          Mother's breast, 
                  ensuring rebirth in the warmth of the coming Spring.

          LUGHNASADH LORE 
           
                    It is appropriate toplant the seedsfrom the fruit consumedin
          ritual.  If they sprout, grow the  plant with love and as a symbol  of
          your connection with the Goddess and God. 

                    Wheat  weaving (the  making  of corn  dollies,  etc.) is  an
          appropriate  activity for  Lughnasadh.   Visits  to fields,  orchards,
          lakes and wells are also traditional. 

                    The foods of Lughnasadh  include bread, blackberries and all
          berries,  acorns (leached  of their poisons  first), crab  apples, all
          grains and locally ripe produce.  A cake is sometimes baked, and cider
          is used in place of wine. 

                    If youdo make afigure of theGod from bread,it can beused for
          the Simple Feast. 
           
          MABON (circa September 21) 
           
                    Decorate the altar with acorns, oak sprigs, pine and cypress
          cones, ears  of corn, wheat  stalks and other  fruits and nuts.   Also
          place there a small rustic basket filled  with dried leaves of various
          colors and kinds.

          slowly  scatter them  so that  they cascade to  the ground  within the
          circle.  Say such words as these: 
           
               Leaves fall, 
                  the days grow cold. 
               The Goddess pulls Her mantle of the Earth around Her as You, 
                  O Great Sun God, 
                  sail toward the West to the lands of 
                  Eternal Enchantment., 
                  wrapped in the coolness of night. 
               Fruits ripen, 
                  seeds drop, 
                  the hours of day and night are balanced. 
               Chill winds blow in from the North wailing laments. 
               In this seeming extinction of nature's power, 
                  O Blessed Goddess, 
                  I know that life continues. 
               For spring is impossible without the second harvest, 
                  as surely as life is impossible without death. 
               Blessings upon You, 
                  O Fallen God, 
                  as You journey into the lands of winter 
                  and into the Goddess' loving arms.

                    A  traditional practice is to  walk wild places and forests,
          gathering seed  pods and dried  plants. Some of  these can be  used to
          decorate the home; others saved for future herbal magick. 

                    The foods ofMabon consistof the secondharvest's gleanings,so
          grains, fruit and vegetables predominate, especially corn.  Corn bread

          other  late autumn  fruits.   Autumn  flowers  such as  marigolds  and
          chrysanthemums are fine too.   Write on a piece of paper  an aspect of
          your life which  you may wish to  be free of; anger,  a baneful habit,
          misplaced feelings, disease.   The cauldron or some similar  tool must
          be present  before  the altar  as  well, on  a  trivet or  some  other
          heat-proof  surface (if the legs  aren't long enough).   A small, flat
          dish  marked with an eight-spoked  wheel symbol should  also be there.
          [This is just  what it sounds like. On  a flat plate or dish,  paint a
          large circle.  Put a dot in  the center of this circle and paint eight
          spokes radiating  out from the  dot to the  larger circle.   Thus, you
          have  a  wheel  symbol  -  a  symbol  of  the  Sabbats,  a  symbol  of
          timelessness.] 

                    Prior toritual, sit quietlyand thinkof friends andloved ones
          who have passed away.  Do not despair.  Know that they have gone on to
          greater things.   Keep  firmly  in mind  that the  physical isn't  the
          absolute reality, and souls never die.

                    Lift one  of the pomegranates and,  with your freshly-washed
          Boline, pierce the skin of the  fruit.  Remove several seeds and place
          them on the wheel-marked dish. 
               Raise your wand, face the altar and say: 
           
               On this night of Samhain I mark Your passing, 
                  O Sun King, 
                  through the sunset into the Land of the            Young. 
               I mark also the passing of all who have gone          before, 
                  and all who will go after.

                  You who gives birth to the fallen, 
                          teach meto know that inthe time of the        greatest
          darkness there is the greatest            light. 
           
                    Taste the pomegranate seeds; burst them with your  teeth and
          savour   their  sharp,  bittersweet   flavour.    Look   down  as  the
          eight-spoked symbol on the plate; the Wheel of the Year,  the Cycle of
          the Seasons, the End and Beginning of all Creation. 

                    Light a firewithin the cauldron(a candle isfine).  Sitbefore
          it, holding the piece of paper, gazing at its flames.  Say: 
           
               Wise One of the Waning Moon, 
                  Goddess of the Starry Night, 
                          I createthis firewithin Your cauldronto      transform
          that which is plaguing me. 
               May the energies be reversed: 
                  From the darkness, light! 
                  From bane, good! 
                  From death, birth! 
           


                                                                            1033
               

                    Light thepaper in thecauldron's flames anddrop it inside. As
          it  burns, know that your  ill diminishes, lessens  and finally leaves
          you as it is consumed within the universal fires.  [The cauldron, seen
          as the Goddess.] 
                    If  you wish, you may attempt scrying  or some other form of
          divination, for  this is  a  perfect time  to look  into  the past  or
          future.  Try  to recall past lives  too, if you  will.  But leave  the
          dead in peace.  Honor  them with your memories but do not call them to
          you.    [Many Pagans  do attempt  to  communicate with  their deceased
          ancestors and friends  at this  time, but it  seems to  me that if  we
          accept  the  doctrine  of  reincarnation,  this  is a  rather  strange
          practice.  Perhaps the personalities that we  knew still exist, but if
          the soul is currently  incarnate in another body, communication  would
          be difficult, to say the least.   Thus, it seems best to remember them
          with peace and love - but do not call  them up.]  Release any pain and
          sense of loss you may feel into the cauldron's flames. 
               Works of magick, if necessary, may follow. 
               Celebrate the Simple Feast. 
               The circle is released. 
           
           
           
          SAMHAIN LORE 
           
                    It is traditional on Samhain night to leave a plate of  food
          outside the home  for the souls of  the dead.  A candle  placed in the
          window guides them to  the Lands of Eternal Summer, and burying apples
          in the hard-packed earth "feeds" the passed ones on their journey. 

                    Forfood, beets,turnips,apples, corn,nuts, gingerbread,cider,
          mulled  wines and pumpkin dishes  are appropriate, as  are meat dishes
          (once again,  if you're  not vegetarian.   If so, tofu  seems ritually
          correct).

          A RITUAL OF GESTURES 
           
                    Stand in the ritualarea.  Stillyour thoughts.  Breathedeeply
          for half a  minute or so until composed  and calm.  Turn your  mind to
          our Deities. 

                    Face North. Lift bothhands to waistheight, palms down. Press
          your fingers  together,  creating  two  solid,  flat  planes.    Sense
          solidity,  foundation,  fertility.   Invoke  the powers  of  the Earth
          through the gesture. 

                    Moments Later, turn toward the East. Raise your hands a foot
          higher,  your palms facing away from  you (no longer parallel with the
          ground), and elbows slightly bent.  Spread your fingers and hold  this
          position, sensing movement  and communication.   Invoke the forces  of
          Air through the gesture. 

                    Face South. Lift your handsfully above yourhead.  Keepingthe
          elbows straight, grasp  your fingers  into tight fists.   Feel  force,
          power,  creation and destruction.   Invoke the forces  of Fire through
          the gesture. 

                    Turn to the West.  Lower your hands a  foot or so.  Bend the
          elbows,  turn  your palms  upward and  cup  them, pressing  the thumbs
          against  the  forefingers.    Sense fluidity,  the  ocean,  liquidity.
          Invoke the forces of Water through the gesture. 

                    Face Northagain.  Throw yourhead back and raiseboth hands to
          the  sky, palms up, fingers spread.   Drink in the essence of The One,
          the  unknowable,  unapproachable ultimate  source  of  all. Sense  the
          mysteries within the universe. 

                    Lower your projective hand (your writing hand) but keep your
          receptive  hand high.   Pressing  the third,  forth and  fifth fingers
          against the  palm, lift the  forefinger and  thumb to  create a  rough
          crescent shape.   Sense the reality  of the Goddess.   Sense Her love,
          Her fertility,  Her compassion.  Sense  the powers of the  Moon in the
          gesture; the force of the eternal seas - the presence of the Goddess. 
                    Lower your receptivehand; liftyour projective hand. Benddown
          the middle and  forth fingers toward the palm, and  trap them with the
          thumb.   Lift the forefinger and little finger up to the sky, creating
          a horned image.  Sense the reality of the God.  Sense the power of the
          Sun  in the  gesture; the  untamed  energies of  the  woodlands -  the
          presence of the God. 

                    Lower yourprojective hand. Laydown flat. Spread yourlegs and
          arms  until you've  created the  pattern  of a  pentagram.   Sense the
          powers  of the  elements running through  you; merging  and coalescing
          into your being.   Sense them as emanations from  The One, the Goddess
          and God. 

               Meditate.  Commune.  Communicate. 
               When finished, simply stand up.  Your rite of gestures is over.

          THE LAW OF THE POWER 
           
                    1.  The Power shall not be used  to bring harm, to injure or
          control  others.  But  if the need  rises, the Power shall  be used to
          protect your life or the life of others. 
               2. The Power is used only as need dictates. 
                    3.The Power can be usedfor your own gain, aslong as by doing
          so you harm none. 
                    4.It is unwiseto accept money forthe use ofthe Power, for it
          quickly controls its taker.  Be not as those of other religions. 
                    5. Use not the Power forprideful gain, for such cheapens the
          mysteries of the Craft and magick. 
                    6. Everremember that the Poweris a sacred giftof the Goddess
          and God, and should never be misused or abused. 
               7. And this is the Law of the Power. 
           
           
           
          INVOCATION OF THE ELEMENTS 
           
          Air, Fire, Water, Earth, 
          Elements of Astral birth, 
          I call you now; attend to me! 
           
          In the circle, rightly cast, 
          Safe from psychic curse or blast, 
          I call you now, attend to me! 
           
          From cave and desert, sea and hill, 
          By blade and wand, cup and pentacle, 
          I call you now; attend to me! 
          This is my will, so mote it be!

                         THE GODDESS AND GOD 
           
                    These prayers can be used toinvoke the Goddess and Godduring
          ritual,  just after  the circle  casting.   Of course,  any which  you
          compose or are inspired to say and be used as well. 
                    A fewchants arealso includedto raise energyor tocommune with
          the deities. 
                    Someof theseinvocations rhyme, andsome donot. But recall the
          power of  rhyme -  it link  our conscious mind  to the  unconscious or
          psychic mind, thereby producing ritual consciousness. 
                    Some of these are  related to specific deities but,  as Dion
          Fortune wrote:  "All the gods are  one god; and all  the goddesses are
          one goddess, and there is only one initiator."

          THE LORE OF NUMBERS

                    To be used in ritual and magickal workings.  In general, odd
          numbers are related to  women, receptive energy and the  Goddess; even
          numbers to men, projective energy and the God.

          1.     The universe; The One; the source of all.

          2.        The  Goddess and  God; The  perfect duality;  projective and
          receptive   energy;   the   couple;   personal   union   with   deity;
          interpenetration of the physical and spiritual; balance.

          3.     The Triple Goddess; the Lunar phases;  the physical, mental and
          spiritual aspects of our species.

          4.        The elements;  the Spirits  of  the Stones;  the winds;  the
          seasons.

          5.     The senses;  the pentagram; the elements plus Akasha; a Goddess
          number.

          7.       The planets which  the ancients knew;  the time of  the Lunar
          phase; power; protection and magick.

          8.     The number of Sabbats; a number of the God.

          9.     A number of the Goddess.

          13.    The number of Esbats; a fortunate number.

          15.    A number of good fortune.

          21.    The number of Sabbats and Esbats in the Pagan year; a number of
          the Goddess.

          28.    A number of the Moon; a number of the goddess.

          101.   The number of fertility.

          OF GATHERING FLOWERS, HERBS AND PLANTS:

                    Before cutting with the Boline, attune with the plantthrough
          visualization.  Feel  its energies.  As you cut,  say these or similar
          words:

                    Olittle plant of (name, such as hyssop,          etc.) I ask
          that you give of your bounty that      it may aid me in my work.  Grow
          stronger by        my  stroke, stronger and more powerful, O          
          plant of (name)!

                    If it isa tree, substitute theappropriate word (tree ofoak).
          Gently cut  only what you  need, and never  from very young  plants or
          more than twenty-five percent of the growth.  At the base of the plant
          leave  an offering: a  silver coin, a  bright jewel, a  bit of wine or
          milk, grain, a quartz crystal and so on.  Cover the offering and it is
          done.



          OF THE CIRCLE

                    The magick circle may be  fashioned with garlands of flowers
          sacred to the Goddess  and God. Alternately, flowers can  be scattered
          around the perimeter of the circle.
                    The  point stones may be ringed with fresh flowers and herbs
          suitable to the elements, such as:

              North: corn, cypress, fern, honeysuckle, wheat, vervain
                    East: acacia,bergamot,clover, dandelion,lavender,lemongrass,
                   mint, mistletoe, parsley, pine
                  South:basil, carnation, cedar,chrysanthemum, dill, ginger,    
                    heliotrope, holly, juniper, marigold, peppermint
                    West: apple blossoms,lemon balm,camellia, catnip,daffodil,  
                elder, gardenia, grape, heather, hibiscus, jasmine, orchid

                    Fresh flowers  may be present on  the altar or,  if none are
          available, greens such as ferns may be used.

                    When casting the circle around a tree, youcan use the fruit,
          leaves,  nuts  or flowers  of that  tree to  mark  out the  circle, if
          desired.

               All of these can be used in addition to the cord and stones.


                                                                            1046
          

          OF THE BALEFIRE:

                    If you wish to build a fire for an outdoor ritual, it can be
          composed of all or any combination of the following woods:

               Rowan              Dogwood
               Mesquite           Poplar
               Oak                Juniper
               Pine               Cedar
               Apple

                    If these are unavailable, use native woods. Rites run on the
          seashore  can  be  illuminated   with  balefires  of  dried  driftwood
          collected prior to the rite.



          OF THE HOME CIRCLE:

                    Magickal plants growing outside the home incontainers can be
          placed around  the circle  or  on the  altar during  ritual.   If  you
          primarily  work indoors,  choose an  odd-numbered selection  of sacred
          plants  and  grow these  in  your  ritual area.    If  they need  more
          sunlight, simply move  them outdoors and  bring inside during  ritual.
          Give them  energy and love,  and they'll aid  you in your  worship and
          magick.

                    Though anybut poisonousplants canbe used,such plantsas these
          are recommended:

               African Violets    Red Geraniums
               Cacti (all types   Rose
               Ferns (all types)  Rose Geranium
               Holly              Rosemary
               Hyssop             Ti (Cordyline terminalis)
               Palms (all types)  Wax Plant (Hoya carnosa)



          OF THE CELEBRANT:

                    Wearfresh flowers and herbs in yourhair and on your body, if
          you prefer, during the rites.  Crowns or caplets of flowers are always
          appropriate for spring and summer rites.  Wear oak and pine during the
          winter rituals.

                    You may wishto wear anecklace ofherbs and seeds,such astonka
          beans, whole nutmegs,  star anise,  acorns and other  seeds and  nuts,
          strung on a natural  fiber.  Strings of small  pine cones may also  be
          worn.

                    For Full  Moon rituals  held at night,  wear night-blooming,
          fragrant flowers to suffuse yourself with Lunar energies.


                                                                            1047
          

          OF THE TOOLS:

                    These are suggestions for dedicating the tools prior totheir
          first use or formal consecration,  if any.  Perform these  with proper
          visualization and ritual intent.

          The Athame or Sword:

                    Rub the blade with  fresh basil, rosemary or oak  leaves, at
          sunrise, outdoors  where you will not  be disturbed or seen.   Lay the
          sword or  Athame on  the ground  with its  point to  the South.   Walk
          clockwise around  it thrice, scattering bay  leaves (preferably fresh)
          over it.   Take up the sword or Athame, stand facing East and, holding
          it upward  but with arms lowered, invoke the God to infuse your Athame
          or sword with His strength.  Point it to the sky, invoking the Goddess
          to charge your blade with Her love and power.

                    Wrap yourAthame or swordin red cloth andtake it home. It may
          be stored in the cloth, if desired.

          The Bolline:

                    Early in the morning, goto a forest (or park, garden,or your
          indoor garden).  Choose the most beautiful and vibrant  plants.  Touch
          the point of the Boline gently  to these in turn, forging a connection
          between your Boline and the plants (and, thusly, the Earth).

                    Next, siton the Earth. Ensuring thatyou are quitealone, draw
          a pentagram with the Boline's point on the ground.  It is done.

          The Wand:

                    If the wand is of wood, take it outdoors at sunsetand rub it
          with fresh lavender,  eucalyptus or mint leaves.  Raise  it in the air
          toward the East (or the Moon if it is visible) and invoke the Goddess.
          At sunrise, take it again outdoors, rub with the fresh fragrant leaves
          and invoke the God by raising it to the East.

          The Pentacle:

                    Place the pentacle on bare Earth.  Lay upon itdried parsley,
          patchouly, mistletoe, or  fresh jasmine or  honeysuckle flowers.   Sit
          before  it facing North for several  seconds, visualizing the pentacle
          absorbing the Earth's energies.  Then pick it up and scatter the herbs
          or flowers to the four quarters, beginning and ending in the North.

                    Ifthis must bedone indoors, filla small dishwith fresh Earth
          and place the pentacle on this.  Proceed as above, saving the herbs or
          flowers to be scattered outdoors at a latter time.


                                                                            1048
          

          The Censer:

                    Fume purerosemary, frankincenseorcopal withinthe censerprior
          to its first use.  Do this for about an hour.

          The Cauldron:

                    Takethe cauldron toa stream, river,lake or ocean. Gather the
          leaves  of some plants growing  nearby (at the  sea, perhaps seaweed).
          Dip the cauldron  into the water to fill it.   Place the leaves in the
          cauldron,  then set it on  the water's edge where  it is on both water
          and sand.   Place your  hands on the  cauldron and dedicate it  to the
          Goddess in any words you like.

                    Salt water corrodes metal. Thoroughly wash the cauldronafter
          immersion in sea or salk water.

          fresh gardenia or some other appropriate flower or herb. Gaze into the
          Chalice and invoke the Goddess  to bless it.   You might also wish  to
          take  it outside  as night,  filled with water,  and catch  the Moon's
          reflection within it.

          The Broom:

                    It canbe fashioned from anash staff, birch twigsand a willow
          binding.  Brush the broom with chamomile, willow, lemon balm, elder or
          mallow  stalks and branches, then bury these  with due solemnity.  You
          might also wish to carve a crescent Moon upon its handle.

          The Crystal:

                    Onthe night ofa FullMoon, rub thesphere with fresh(or dried)
          mugwort, then take it outside.   Hold it up  so that it drinks in  the
          light and energies of the Moon.   Gaze at the Moon through the crystal
          by holding it before your eyes.  Repeat at least thrice yearly for the
          best benefits.

          The Book of Shadows:

                    Sewinto the cover of the Bookof Shadows leaves of the sacred
          herbs vervain, rue,  bay, willow or others, if you  wish.  They should
          be  well-dried and  secretly placed  by the  light of  the Moon.   The
          covers of the Book of Shadows should, of course, be covered with cloth
          for this purpose.

          SPELLS AND MAGICK

          PROTECTIVE CHANT

                    Visualizea triplecircle ofpurplish lightaround youbody while
          chanting:

               I am protected by your might,
               O gracious Goddess, day and night.

               Another of the same type: visualize a triple circle and chant:

               Thrice around the circle's bound,
               Evil sink into the ground.



          A MIRROR SPELL OF PROTECTION FOR THE HOME

                    Compose analtar: place acenser inthe center beforean imageof
          the  Goddess.  Have a twelve-inch (or  so) round mirror there as well.
          Ring the  altar with nine  white candles.   Burn a  protective incense
          (such as sandalwood, frankincense, copal or rosemary) in the censer.
                    Beginningwiththe candlemost directlybefore theGoddess image,
          say these or similar words:

               Lunar light protect me!

               Repeat as you light each candle until all are glowing.
                    Now,holding the mirror, invokethe Goddess inHer lunar aspect
          with these or similar words:

               Great Goddess of the Lunar Light
                  and Mistress of the Seas;
               Great Goddess of the Mystic Night
                  and of the Mysteries;
               Within this place of candles bright
                  and with Your mirror nigh;
               Protect me with Your awesome might
                  while ill vibrations fly!

                    Standing before thealtar, holdthe mirror facingthe candlesso
          that it reflects their flames.  Keeping the mirror toward the candles,
          move  slowly,  clockwise, around  the  altar,  watching the  reflected
          firelight bouncing off your surroundings.

                    Gradually increaseyour speed,mentally invoking theGoddess to
          protect you.  Move faster  and faster; watch the light  shattering the
          air, cleansing it,  burning away  all negativity and  all lines  along
          witch the ill energies have traveled into your home.

                    Charge your homewith the protectivelight of theGoddess. Race
          around  the candles until you've felt the atmosphere change, until you
          feel  that  your home  has  been  cleansed and  guarded  by the  Great
          Goddess.

                    When finished, stand once again before the image.  Thank the
          Goddess in any words you wish.  Pinch out the candles one by one, bind
          them  together with white  cord and store  them in a  safe place until
          (and if) you need to use them again for this same purpose.

          A SPELL TO BREAK THE POWERS OF A SPELL

                    Ifyou believe that a spell hasbeen cast against you, place a
          large black candle in a cauldron (or a large  black bowl).  The candle
          must be tall enough to  extend a few inched above the  cauldron's rim.
          Affix the candle to the bottom of the cauldron with  warmed beeswax or
          the drippings of another black candle so that it will not tip over.

                    Fill the cauldron tothe rim with fresh water,without wetting
          the candle's wick.   An inch or two of the  candle should remain above
          the water.   Deep breathe,  meditate, clear  your mind, and  light the
          candle.   Visualize the suspected spell's power as residing within the
          candle's  flame.   Sit  in  quiet  contemplation  of  the  candle  and
          visualize the power flowing  and growing with the candle's  flame (yes
          the  power against  you).  As  the candle  burns down,  its flame will
          eventually sputter and go  out as it contacts  the water.  As soon  as
          the  flame has  been  extinguished by  the water,  the  spell will  be
          dispersed.

                    Break your visualization of the spell's power;see it explode
          into dust, becoming impotent.

                    Pourthe water intoa hole inthe ground,a lake orstream.  Bury
          the candle.  It is done.



          TO PROTECT AN OBJECT

                    Withthe firstand middle fingers(or yourAthame, ifyou have it
          with  you), trace  a  pentagram  over  the  object  to  be  protected.
          Visualize electric-blue  or purple  flame streaming from  your fingers
          (Athame) to form the pentagram.  Say this as you trace:

               With this pentagram I do lay
               Protection here both night and day.
               And to the one who should not touch
               Let the fingers burn and twitch.
               I now invoke the Law of Three:
               This is my will, so mote it be!

          CRYSTAL MAGICK

                    Crystals andstones are gifts ofthe Goddess and God. They are
          sacred, magickal tools which can be used to enhance ritual and magick.
          Here are some of the ways of Earth magick.


                                                                            1055
          

          PREPARING THE CIRCLE:

                    The magick circlecan be laid out withcrystals and stones, if
          desired, rather than with herbs.

                    Beginning and ending in the North, lay 7, 9, 21 or 40 quarts
          crystals of any  size around the circle, either inside  the cord or in
          place of it.   If the ritual to be conducted within the circle is of a
          usual spiritual  or magickal  nature, place  the quartz crystals  with
          points outward.  If of a  protective nature, place with points  facing
          inward.

                    If youuse candlesto markthe four quartersof themagick circle
          rather than  large stones, ring  each candle  with any or  all of  the
          following stones:

               North: Moss Agate, Emerald, Jet, Olivine, Salt, Black Tourmaline
                East: Imperial Topaz, Citrine, Mica, Pumice
               South: Amber, Obsidian, Rhodochrosite, Ruby, Lava, Garnet
                      West:Aquamarine,Chalcedony, Jade,Lapis Lazuli,Moonstone,  
                 Sugilite



          A STONE ALTAR:

                    Tomake this altar, searchthrough dry riverbeds and seashores
          for a  variety of  smoothly-shaped stones.   Or  check rock  shops for
          appropriate pieces.

                    Create thealtar itself ofthree large stones. Two smallerones
          of even  size are  used as  the base,  while a  longer, flat  stone is
          placed on top  of these to form  the altar itself.  On  this place one
          stone to the left of the  altar to represent the Goddess.  This  might
          be a natural,  river-rounded stone,  a holed stone,  a quartz  crystal
          sphere,  or any of the stones related  to the Goddess which are listed
          below.

                    Tothe right of the altar, placea stone to represent the God.
          This might be a piece of lava, a quartz crystal point, a long, thin or
          club-shaped  rock or  a  God-symbolic stone  such  as those  presented
          below.

                    Between thesetwo stones placea smallerstone with ared candle
          affixed to it to represent the divine energy of the Goddess and God as
          well as the element of Fire.

                    Beforethis, place a flat stone to receive offerings of wine,
          honey, cakes, semi-precious stones, flowers and fruit.

                    A small,cupped stone (ifone can befound) should be setto the
          left of  the offering stone.   Fill this with water  to represent that
          element.

                    To theright of the offeringstone place aflat rock. Pour salt
          upon this to symbolize the element of Earth.

                    Additionally, another  flat stone  can be placed  before the
          offering stone to serve as an incense burner.

                    Any other tools which are needed can simply be placed on the
          altar.  Or, try to find stone alternatives to them.

               This can be used for all types of Craft rituals.

          [Pearl  and coral  have  been mentioned  in  these lists  as  "stones"
          because they were anciently thought to be such.  Our knowledge of them
          as products of living creatures leaves us with the ethical question of
          whether or  not  to use  them in  ritual.   This  must be  a  personal
          decision.   Beach gathered coral and  shells (mother of pearl  is from
          shells)  can be  used  without conflicting  with  the above  statement
          because the  creature has already died by the time the item was found.
          If you decide not to use them, just remember leather is also a product
          of a living creature.]



          CAIRNS:

                    Inearlier times, throughout the world,people built mounds or
          piles of stones.  These  were sometimes formed to mark the  passage of
          travelers,  or  to commemorate  some  historic even,  but  such cairns
          usually had ritual significance.

                    In  magickal  thought, cairns  are  places of  power.   They
          concentrate the  energies of the stones  used to create them.   Cairns
          are  rooted  in the  Earth but  lift upward  to the  sky, symbolically
          representing  the interconnectedness  of  the  physical and  spiritual
          realms.

                    Duringoutdoor circles, a smallcairn, composed ofno more than
          nine or eleven rocks, can be fashioned as each point of the  Circle of
          Stones.  This can be done prior to creating the circle itself.

                    The nexttime you're insome wild, lonelyplace with aprofusion
          of  stones, clear a  place among them  and sit.   Visualize a magickal
          need.   As  you visualize,  grasp a  near-by stone.   Feel  the energy
          beating  within it  - the  power of  the Earth,  the power  of nature.
          Place it  on  the  cleared  ground.   Pick  up  another  stone,  still
          visualizing you need, and set it next to the first.

                    Stillvisualizing, continue toadd stones, buildingthem into a
          small pile.   Keep  adding stones  until you  feel them  vibrating and
          pulsating before you.   Place the last  rock on top of  the cairn with
          firm ritual  intent - affirm to  yourself, to the cairn  and the Earth
          that with this final magickal act you're manifesting your need.

                    Placeyour hands oneither sideof the pile. Giveit your energy
          through your visualization.  Nurse it.  Feed it strength  and see your
          need as being fulfilled.

               Then leave the cairn alone to do its work.

          a  dollar sign for  money, a fist  for strength.   Alternately, use an
          appropriate rune or write your need on the candle with the crystal.

                    As you scratchor draw,visualize your needwith crystalclarity
          as if it had already manifested.   Place the candle in a holder.   Set
          the crystal near it and light the wick.

                    As the flame shines, again strongly visualize.  The crystal,
          candle and symbol will do their work.

          A SELF-DEDICATION RITE

               Prepare yourself by doing the Ritual Bath and Self Blessing.
                    If you,reperforming this ritual at the sea or a river, bathe
          there if you so desire.

                    As  you bathe,  prepare  for the  coming  rite.   Open  your
          consciousness  to higher levels of  awareness.  Breath  deep.  Cleanse
          your mind as well as your body.

                    After bathing, dry and dressfor the journey. Go to aplace in
          the wild where you feel safe.   It should be a comfortable spot  where
          you won't  be disturbed  by others,  an area where  the powers  of the
          Earth and  the Elements  are evident.   It  may be  a mountain  top, a
          desert canyon or  cave, perhaps  a dense forest,  a rocky  outcropping
          over the sea,  a quiet island in the center of  a lake.  Even a lonely
          part  of a park or  garden can be  used.  Draw on  your imagination to
          find the place.

                    Youneed take nothingwith you buta vial ofrichly scented oil.
          Sandalwood, frankincense, cinnamon or  any other scent is fine.   When
          you  arrive at  the place  of dedication,  remove your  shoes and  sit
          quietly for a few moments.  Calm your heart if you've exerted yourself
          during your travel.  Breathe deeply to return to normal, and keep your
          mind  free  of  cluttered thoughts.    Open  yourself  to the  natural
          energies around you.

                    When you're calm, riseand pivot slowly on onefoot, surveying
          the land  around you.  You're  seeking the ideal  spot.  Don't  try to
          find it; open your awareness to the place.  When  you've discovered it
          (and  you'll know when), sit,  kneel or lie flat on  your back.  Place
          the oil on the Earth beside you, Don't stand - contact the Earth.

                    Continue deep breathing. Feelthe energiesaround you. Callthe
          Goddess  and  God  in  any  words  you  like,  or  use  the  following
          invocation.   Memorize  these words  before the  rite so  that they'll
          spill effortlessly from you, or improvise:

               O Mother Goddess,
               O Father God,
               Answers to all mysteries and yet mysteries unanswered;
               In this place of power I open myself to Your Essence.
               In this place and in this time I am changed;
               From henceforth I walk the Paths of the Craft.
               I dedicate myself to you, Mother Goddess and Father God.

          (rest for a moment, silent, still.  Then continue:)

                    I breathe you energies intomy body,                         
                 commingling, blending,
                  mixing them with mine,
                  that I may see the divine in nature,
                  nature in the divine,
                  and divinity within myself and all else.
               O Great Goddess,
               O Great God,
                  Make me one with your essence
                  Make me one with your essence
                  Make me one with your essence.


                                                                            1060
               

                    You may feel bursting with power and  energy, or calm and at
          peace.   Your mind  might be in  a whirl.   The Earth  beneath you may
          throb  and undulate  with  energy.   Wild  animals, attracted  by  the
          psychic occurrence, might grace you with their presence.

                    Whatever occurs, knowthat youhave opened yourselfand thatthe
          Goddess and God have heard you.   You should feel different inside, at
          peace or simply powerful.

                    After the invocation, wet a finger with the oil and mark the
          symbols  of the Goddess  and God somewhere  on your body.   It doesn't
          matter where; you  can do this  on your  chest, forehead, arms,  legs,
          anywhere.   As you anoint,  visualize these symbols  sinking into your
          flesh,  glowing as  they  enter your  body  and then  dispersing  into
          millions of tiny points of light.

                    Theformal self-dedication is ended. Thank theGoddess and God
          for  Their attention.   Sit and meditate  before leaving  the place of
          dedication.

               Once home, celebrate in some special way.

          THE DAYS OF POWER


                    In the past, when peoplelived with Nature, the turningof the
          seasons  and the monthly  cycle of the  Moon had a  profound impact on
          religious ceremonies.   Because the Moon  was seen as a  symbol of the
          Goddess, ceremonies as adoration  and magick took place in  its light.
          The coming  of Winter, the first stirrings  of Spring, the warm Summer
          and the advent of Fall were also marked with rituals.

                    The Witches,heirsof thepre-Christian folkreligions ofEurope,
          still celebrate the Full Moon and observe the changing of the seasons.
          The Pagan  religious calendar contains  13 Full Moon  celebrations and
          eight Sabbats or days of power.

                    Four of thesedays (or,more properly, nights)are determinedby
          the  Solstices  and  Equinoxes,  the astronomical  beginnings  of  the
          seasons.   The  other four  ritual  occasions are  based on  old  folk
          festivals.  The  rituals give structure  and order to the  Pagan year,
          and also  remind us of the endless cycle that will continue long after
          we're gone.

                    Four of theSabbats - perhaps thosethat have been observedfor
          the longest time -  were probably associated with the  agriculture and
          the bearing cycles of animals.  These are Imbolc (February 2), Beltane
          (April 30), Lughnasadh  (August 1)  and Samhain (October  31).   These
          names  are  Celtic and  are quite  common  among Witches,  though many
          others exist.

                    When careful observationof theskies led tocommon knowledgeof
          the astronomical  year, the Solstices  and Equinoxes (circa  March 21,
          June 21, September 21 and December 21; the actual dates vary from year
          to year) were brought into this religious structure.

                    Who first beganworshipping and raising energy atthese times?
          That  question cannot  be answered.   However,  these sacred  days and
          nights are the origins of the 21 Craft ritual occasions.

                    Many of thesesurvive todayin both secularand religiousforms.
          May   Day   celebrations,   Hallowe'en,  Ground-hog   Day   and   even
          Thanksgiving, to  name some popular  North American holidays,  are all
          connected with ancient Pagan  worship.  Heavily Christianized versions
          of the Sabbats have also been preserved within the Catholic Church.

                    The Sabbats are Solarrituals, marking the points ofthe Sun's
          yearly  cycle, and are but half of the  Pagan ritual year.  The Esbats
          are  the Pagan  Full Moon  celebrations.   At this  time we  gather to
          worship She  Who Is.  Not that  Witches omit the God  at Esbats - both
          are usually revered on all ritual occasions.

                    There are 13 Full Moons yearly, orone every 28 1/4 days. The
          Moon is a symbol of the Goddess as well as a source of energy.   Thus,
          after  the religious  aspects of  the  Esbats, Witches  often practice
          magick, tapping into the larger amounts of energy which are thought to
          exist at these times.


                                                                            1062
               

                    Some of the oldCraft festivals, stripped of theironce sacred
          qualities by the dominance of Christianity, have degenerated.  Samhain
          seems to have been taken over by candy manufacturers in North America,
          while Yule has  been transformed from one of the  most holy Pagan days
          to  a  time of  gross  commercialism.   Even  the  later  echoes of  a
          Christian savior's birth are  hardly audible above the  electronic hum
          of cash registers.

                    But the old magick remains on these days and nights, and the
          Craft celebrate  them.   Rituals vary greatly,  but all relate  to the
          Goddess and God  and to our home, the  Earth.  Most rites are  held at
          night for  practical purposes as well  as to lend a  sense of mystery.
          The Sabbats,  being Solar-oriented,  are more naturally  celebrated at
          noon or at dawn, but this is rare today.

          THE SABBATS

                    TheSabbats tell osone ofthe stories ofthe Goddessand God, of
          their relationship and the effects this has on the fruitfulness of the
          Earth.   There are many variations on these myths, but here's a fairly
          common one, woven into the basic descriptions of the Sabbats.

                    The Goddess  gives birth to a  son, the God,  at Yule (circa
          December 21).  This  is in no way an adaptation  of Christianity.  The
          Winter  Solstice has  long been  viewed as  a time  of divine  births.
          Mithras  was said  to have  been born  at this  time.   The Christians
          simply adopted it for their use in 273 C.E. (Common Era).

                    Yule isa time of thegreatest darkness and isthe shortest day
          of the year.   Earlier peoples noticed such phenomena  and supplicated
          the forces of  nature to  lengthen the  days and  shorten the  nights.
          Witches  sometimes celebrate Yule just before dawn, then watch the Sun
          rise as a fitting finale to their efforts.

                    Sincethe God is also theSun, this marks thepoint of the year
          when the  Sun is reborn  as well.   Thus, the  Witches light  fires or
          candles to welcome the Sun's returning light.  The Goddess, slumbering
          through the Winter of Her labor, rests after Her delivery.

                    Yule is remnantof early rituals celebratedto hurry theend of
          Winter and  the bounty  of Spring,  when food  was once  again readily
          available.  To contemporary Witches it is a reminder that the ultimate
          product of  death is rebirth,  a comforting thought  in these  days of
          unrest


                                                                            1063
          

          IMBOLC

                    Imbolc (February 2) marks the recovery of the Goddess  after
          giving birth to the God.  The lengthening periods of light awaken Her.
          The God  is a young, lusty  boy, but His  power is felt in  the longer
          days.  The warmth fertilizes the Earth (the Goddess), and causes seeds
          to  germinate and sprout.   And so  the earliest  beginnings of Spring
          occur.

                    This is a Sabbat  of purification after the shut-in  life of
          Winter, through the renewing power  of the Sun.  It is also a festival
          of light and  of fertility, once  marked in  Europe with huge  blazes,
          torches and  fire  in  every  form.   Fire  here  represents  our  own
          illumination and inspiration as much as light and warmth.

                    Imbolc is also known as Feast of Torches,Oimelc, Lupercalia,
          Feast  of Pan, Snowdrop Festival, Feast of the Waxing Light, Brighid's
          Day, and probably by many other names.  Some female Witches follow the
          old Scandinavian custom  of wearing  crowns of lit  candles, but  many
          more carry tapers during their invocations.

                    Thisis oneof thetraditional timesfor initiationsinto covens,
          and so self-dedication rituals, such as the  one outlined in this Book
          of Shadows, can be performed or renewed at this time.

          OSTARA

                    Ostara (circa March  21), the Spring Equinox,  also known as
          Spring, Rites  of Spring and Eostra's Day, marks the first day of true
          Spring.  The energies of Nature subtly shift from the  sluggishness of
          Winter to the exuberant expansion of Spring.  The Goddess blankets the
          Earth  with fertility,  bursting  forth from  Her  sleep, as  the  God
          stretches and  grows to maturity.   He  walks the greening  fields and
          delights in the abundance of nature.

                    On Ostara  the hours of day  and night are equal.   Light is
          overtaking darkness; the Goddess  and God impel the wild  creatures of
          the Earth to reproduce.

                    Thisis a timeof beginnings, of action,of planting spells for
          future gains, and of tending the ritual gardens.

          BELTANE

                    Beltane (April 30) marks the emergence of the young God into
          manhood.   Stirred by the energies  at work in Nature,  He desires the
          Goddess.  They fall in  love, lie among the grasses and  blossoms, and
          unite.   The Goddess becomes pregnant  of the God.   Witches celebrate
          the symbol of Her fertility in ritual.

                    Beltane (alsoknown as MayDay) has longbeen marked withfeasts
          and rituals.   May poles,  supremely phallic symbols,  were the  focal
          point of  Old English village rituals.   Many persons rose  at dawn to
          gather flowers and green  branches from the fields and  gardens, using
          them to decorate the May pole, their homes and themselves.

                    The flowers andgreenery symbolizethe Goddess; theMay polethe
          God.   Beltane  marks the  return of  vitality, of  passion  and hopes
          consummated.

                    May poles are sometimes used by Witches today during Beltane
          rituals,  but the cauldron is  a more common  focal point of ceremony.
          It represents, of  course, the Goddess - the essence of womanhood, the
          end of all desire, the equal but opposite of the May pole, symbolic of
          the God.

          MIDSUMMER

                    Midsummer, the SummerSolstice (circa June 21), also known as
          Litha,  arrives when the powers  of Nature reach  their highest point.
          The Earth is awash in the fertility of the Goddess and God.

                    In  the past,  bonfires were  leapt to  encourage fertility,
          purification, health and  love.   The fire once  again represents  the
          Sun, feted on this time of the longest daylight hours.
               Midsummer is a classic time for magick of all kinds.

          LUGHNASADH

                    Lughnasadh (August 1)is thetime of thefirst harvest, whenthe
          plants of  Spring wither and drop their fruits or seeds for our use as
          well as to ensure future crops.   Mystically, so too does the God lose
          His strength as  the Sun rises farther in  the South each day  and the
          nights  grow longer.   The Goddess  watches in  sorrow and  joy as She
          realizes  that the God  is dying, and  yet lives on inside  Her as Her
          child.

                    Lughnasadh, also known as AugustEve, Feast of Bread, Harvest
          Home  and Lammas,  wasn't  necessarily  observed  on  this  day.    It
          originally coincided with the first reapings.

                    AsSummer passes, Witches rememberits warmth andbounty in the
          food we eat.  Every  meal is an act  of atunement with Nature, and  we
          are reminded that nothing in the universe is constant.


                                                                            1065
          

          MABON

                    Mabon (circaSeptember 21),theAutumn Equinox,is thecompletion
          of the  harvest begun  as Lughnasadh.   Once again  day and  night are
          equal, poised as the God prepares to leave His physical body and begin
          the great adventure into the unseen, toward renewal and rebirth of the
          Goddess.

                    Nature declines, drawsback its bounty,readying for Winterand
          its time of rest.  The Goddess nods in the weakening Sun, though  fire
          burns within Her womb.  She feels  the presence of the God even as  He
          wanes.

          SAMHAIN

                    At Samhain(October 31),the Craftsay farewell tothe God. This
          is a  temporary farewell.  He  isn't wrapped in eternal  darkness, but
          readies to be reborn of the Goddess at Yule.

                    Samhain, alsoknown as NovemberEve, Feast ofthe Dead, Feastof
          Apples, Hallows, All Hallows  and Hallowe'en, once marked the  time of
          sacrifice.   In  some  places  this was  the  time  when animals  were
          slaughtered to ensure food throughout the depths of Winter.  The God -
          identified with  the animals -  fell as well to  ensure our continuing
          existence.

                    Samhainis a time of reflection, oflooking back over the last
          year, of coming to terms with the one phenomenon of life over which we
          have no control - death.

                    The Craft feel that on this night the separation between the
          physical  and spiritual  realities is  thin.   Witches remember  their
          ancestors and all those who have gone before.

                    After Samhain, Witches celebrateYule, and so the Wheelof the
          Year is complete.


                                                                            1066
               

                    Surely thereare mysteries buried here. Why is theGod the son
          and then  the  lover of  the  Goddess?   This  isn't incest,  this  is
          symbolism.  In  this agricultural story (one of  many Craft myths) the
          everchanging  fertility of the Earth is represented by the Goddess and
          God.  This myth speaks  of the mysteries of birth, death  and rebirth.
          It  celebrates the wondrous aspects and beautiful effects of love, and
          honors women who perpetuate our species.   It also points out the very
          real dependence  that humans have on  the Earth, the Sun  and the Moon
          and of the effects of the seasons on our daily lives.

                    Toagricultural peoples, the majorthrust of thismyth cycle is
          the production of food  through the interplay between the  Goddess and
          God.   Food - without which we would all die - is intimately connected
          with  the  deities.     Indeed,  Witches  see  food  as   yet  another
          manifestation of divine energy.

                    And so, byobserving the Sabbats, Witches attunethemselves to
          the Earth  and  to the  deities.   They  reaffirm their  Earth  roots.
          Performing rituals on  the nights  of the Full  Moon also  strengthens
          their connections with the Goddess in particular.

                    It is thewise Witch who celebrates on theSabbats and Esbats,
          for these are times of real as well as symbolic power.  Honoring  them
          in some fashion is an integral part of Witchcraft.

          THE ESBATS

                    When our  earliest ancestors  first painted images  of their
          religious rituals on the walls  of sacred caves and understood all  of
          Nature to be inhabited by Spirit, there can be little  doubt that they
          first reckoned time by the waxing and waning of the Moon.  The primary
          reason for this  is that the monthly  cycles of the Moon  are far more
          visible  than the slow and subtle changes  in the position of the Sun,
          even to someone  who is  not especially looking  for repeated  cycles.
          One  of the  earliest  calendars known  (although its  use is  still a
          controversy that may  never be settled) is a  30,000 year-old piece of
          bone from  Europe.   It is  pierced with variously  shaped holes  in a
          series  of sevens,  suggesting the  quarters of  the Moon,  in  a loop
          design, which  represents the Lunar  cycle from  New Moon to  Full and
          back to the New or Dark of the Moon.  The artifact, just a  few inches
          across,  describes three  such  Lunar cycles  -  three months  or  one
          season.

                    Because there are 13 Lunar months in a year, and because the
          first New Moon does not necessarily coincide with the first day of the
          first Solar month, the Full Moon, midpoint of the lunar month, may not
          always fall in  the Solar month that is given here.  And because there
          are  13 Full  Moons in a  Solar year,  one month  will have two.   The
          second Full  Moon to occur  in a Solar  month is popularly  called the
          Blue Moon.


                                                                            1067
          

          JANUARY

                    To each Lunar monththe ancients assigned a namein accordance
          with  the nature of  the activity that  took place at that  time.  The
          Moon of deepest Winter  is the Wolf Moon, and its name  recalls a time
          when  our ancestors  gathered  close around  the  hearth fire  as  the
          silence  of the falling  snow was  pierced by  the howling  of wolves.
          Driven by hunger,  wolves came closer  to villages than  at any  other
          time of  the year, and may  have occasionally killed a  human being in
          order to survive.

                    The wolf innorthern countries wasat one timeso feared thatit
          became  the   image  of  Fenris,  the  creature  of  destruction  that
          supposedly will  devour the world at  the end of time.   The Christian
          version of  the myth would leave  it at that, but  the myth continues.
          Like  the  wolf in  the fairy  tale  of Little  Red  Ridinghood, which
          preserves  the full  idea of  the myth  but is  used only  to frighten
          children, the wolf is slain;  and the grandmother, like the world,  is
          brought forth once more.

                    As the lightof the new-born yearslowly increases andthe Wolf
          Moon  waxes full, it is  a good time to look  back upon that which has
          just ended  and learn from our experiences.  Bid the past farewell and
          let  it go  in order  to receive  the year  that has  just  been born.
          Learning to  let go of  that which  we would  cling to is  one of  the
          greatest secrets of magick.

          FEBRUARY

                    The Moon followingthe Wolf Moonis the StormMoon.  Whetheryou
          meet  with a  coven on  the night of  the Full  Moon, salute  Her in a
          solitary ritual, or simply blow Her a kiss, bear in mind the magick of
          this  night and  the nature  of the  storms of  February.   Unlike the
          boisterous storms of the light half of the year, which are accompanied
          by the  clashing of thunder  and the flinging of  lightning bolts, the
          storms  of  February  come in  silence.   They  blanket  the  world in
          coldness in  keeping with the nature of the  dark half of the Wheel of
          the  Year.  But  beneath the blanket  of cold and  silent snow, Nature
          rests, as we  do when in the realm of the Spirit that is called death;
          and like those in the world of Spirit, Nature prepares for life anew.


                                                                            1068
          

          MARCH

                    The Moon following the Storm Moon is the Chaste Moon.   Like
          Diana, chaste  Goddess of the  Moon, all of  Nature at this  moment is
          pure  potential waiting to be fulfilled.   The Goddess has many forms:
          The maiden  pure and  lovely as  the snow  of February,  the seductive
          enchantress  of the  night, or  the Crone  ancient and  wise.   As the
          Goddess can  change Her form according to the Moon or according to Her
          will,  ever renewing  Herself, ever  beginning again,  se can  we, Her
          children,  always  begin again  by  discovering  new potential  within
          ourselves.   When you cast  the Circle  of the Chaste  Moon, when  the
          candles  have  been  lit and  the  incense  burned,  look deep  within
          yourself  to discover  what  potential lies  there  waiting, like  the
          Maiden, to be fulfilled.

                      As it is the time forthe planting of seeds on the material
          plane, so may it  be time to do so on the psychic  planes as well.  On
          the night that  the Seed Moon  (another name for  the Chaste Moon)  of
          March is  full, cast  your magick  Circle.  Then  before the  rite has
          ended, select the spiritual seeds  you would like to plant.   They may
          be  seeds of  wisdom,  seeds of  understanding,  or seeds  of  certain
          magickal skills.   Then by an  act of will, plant  these seeds in  the
          fertile soil of your  subconscious mind with the firm  commitment that
          they will be nurtured and cultivated in the months that  lie ahead, so
          that they will grow and flower and bear fruit.

          APRIL

                    Asthe Hare Moonof Aprilwaxes full,observe therabbits leaping
          and playing,  carefree in their mating and  joyful in their games, and
          as you  cast your  Esbat Circle  and  joyfully dance  the round,  feel
          within your heart the carefree nature  of the wild creatures that  are
          also children of the Old Gods.

          MAY

                    This time ofthe Sacred Marriage of the Godand Goddess is the
          Dyad Moon,  the time when  the two  become one, when  all things  meet
          their opposites  in perfect balance  and in  perfect harmony.   As you
          cast your  Circle this  night of  the Dyad Moon,  adorn it  with apple
          blossoms, and  light candles of white.  When the sacred round has been
          danced, sit a moment and reflect.  Seek harmony in all things.  As the
          dark  half of  the  Wheel of  the  Year balances  the  light, as  heat
          balances cold, recall  the words of the Goddess, "Let  there be beauty
          and  strength, power  and compassion,  honor and  humility,  mirth and
          reverence,  within you."  And then before the  rite is ended, if it is
          appropriate, become one with your working partner,  physically as well
          as spiritually.

          JUNE

                    Afterthe spectacular flowers of May have passed and the bees
          have gathered their pollen and nectar, the hives are filled with honey
          that is waiting to  be gathered.  In ancient times much  of this honey
          was made into a drink called mead by a fermentation process similar to
          that of making  wine.  The "Moon in June" is  the Mead Moon.  Mead has
          been considered to have magickal and even life-restoring properties in
          many of the countries of ancient Europe, and  it was the drink of many
          of the great heroes of legend.

                    Thelegendary figureRobin Hood, whois acceptedhistorically as
          being a composite of several peasant leaders during the  reign of King
          Richard I,  is also generally accepted  by Pagans as being  one of us.
          One reason is that Robin was a popular Witch name, and also because he
          was always described as  being dressed in green, symbolic of the Green
          Man of Sherwood Forest.   Lincoln green, which is made from  woad, the
          dyestuff   used  by  the  Picts  of  ancient  Britain  and  the  Druid
          priestesses, is also a color  that symbolizes, historically, the Pagan
          peasantry.   Among the articles robbed from the rich by Robin Hood are
          "met and met."  This  probably means "meat and mead."  In  the myth of
          Odin, one of  His quests is for the Poetic  Mead of Inspiration, which
          He returns to the realm of the Gods where  it belongs, but a few drops
          fall to Earth, and this may be had by anyone who can find them.

                    Onthe night thatthe Mead Moonwaxes full, afterthe Circle has
          been  cast and  dancing  done,  fill  the  cup with  mead  (if  it  is
          available), sweet wine, or an herb  tea sweetened with honey.  Sip the
          sweet drink  and  sit quietly  and  make yourself  a vessel  ready  to
          receive the inspiration of the higher realms.  Become a mead cup ready
          to be filled, not  with the brew of everyday life but  with the clear,
          bright liquid of illumination.   Every time this ritual  is performed,
          even  if there  are  no immediate  results, you  are  becoming a  more
          perfect vessel for divine inspiration.

                    If the  night of the Mead  Moon is very close  to the Summer
          Solstice, the results  of this exercise can be very  powerful.  If the
          Mead Moon is full on Midsummer Night, then the priestess into whom the
          Moon is Drawn should be prepared.

          JULY

                    As the  Wort Moon of July  waxes full, this is  the time for
          gathering of  herbs.   The word  wort is  old Anglo-Saxon  for "herb."
          When  the magickal herbs have been gathered  and hung to dry, the time
          of the Wort Moon is the time  to give thanks to the spirits who  dwell
          in  the herb garden, and  to leave them  an offering.   Perhaps as you
          place an  offering in  the moonlit  garden, they will  whisper to  you
          other secrets of herbal magick.

          AUGUST

                    One day atmid-month we realize that therobins and wrens that
          were nesting nearby  have simply  vanished.  Their  lovely songs  have
          been replaced  by the shrill calls of the bluejays, who were so silent
          during the nesting season.

                    As  August progresses the  days are still  hot but nighttime
          temperatures   are  beginning   to  cool,   and  the   late  afternoon
          thunderstorms  that bring the cooler air also bring about the ripening
          of tomatoes.

                    In thefields and meadowsand along roadsidesnow thereare wild
          herbs  to be gathered.   There are  goldenrod, Queen Anne's  lace, and
          milkweed  - all  awaiting the natural  dyer who can  extract from them
          tan, green, and bright  yellow respectively, for dyes and  for natural
          inks for talismans.  Among the medicinal herbs to be collected at this
          time is boneset,  which does not  help broken bones  to heal but  is a
          febrifuge that  was used  as  a remedy  for "Breakbone  Fever" in  the
          1840s.  Milkweed  pods with  their silken fluff,  goldenrod, and  wild
          grasses and grains  gathered now will  be dried in  time to adorn  the
          altar at the Autumnal Equinox.

                    As thearomatic herbs begin tofill the rafters inthe dry heat
          of  the attic,  and the  braids  of onions  and garlic  fill the  cool
          darkness of the root cellar, the golden grain and yellow corn ripen in
          the fields under the waning August Sun.

                    Tothe Ancients thiswas the Barley Moon,a time to contemplate
          the  eternalness of  life.  Just  as we  are descended  from the first
          woman  and the first man, who descended from the Gods, so is the grain
          of the bread that we eat descended from the first grain ever gathered.
          By ritually eating the Lammas bread we are participating in a chain of
          events that stretches back  through time to the Gods themselves.   And
          here before us in the ripening fields is the promise of the future.

                    Everywhere there is abundance -in herb garden, the vegetable
          garden, the field, and the orchard.  The pantry shelves are lined with
          glistening  glass  jars  that  are  filled  with  colorful  fruits and
          vegetables  preserved for  Winter  days;    quarts  of  red  tomatoes,
          cucumbers in slices or spears, dark red beets with cloves and cinnamon
          sticks, the yellow of  corn, the orange of  carrots - a feast for  the
          eyes  as well  as the  palate.   The house  is filled  with delightful
          aromas as  pickling spices  are added  to crocks  of brine  and exotic
          chutneys simmer on the stove.

                    But thetime of abundance isdrawing to a close. The fireflies
          of  June and July have given way  to katydids, whose scratchy calls to
          one another fill  the evening air of August with  the promise of frost
          in six weeks.

          SEPTEMBER

                    Sincewine was, and is, such asacred fluid, the Pagans of old
          naturally named this Lunar month the  Wine Moon.  As you celebrate the
          night  of  the Full  Wine Moon  and dance  the  magickal round  in the
          moonlit Circle, pour some white wine in a silver cup.  Before the rite
          is ended, if possible, catch Her reflection in the liquid, then take a
          sip.  As the Moon-blessed  wine casts its inner glow, sit  quietly and
          feel your own spirit, of  which the wine is a symbol.  As  the body is
          stilled and the spirit soars, feel on this night of magick a sense  of
          the kind  of  transformation that  takes place  during true  spiritual
          initiation.

                    Today the term HarvestMoon is appliedto the Full Moonnearest
          to the Autumnal Equinox.  This is because, it is said, in  other times
          when harvesting was  done by  hand, as the  days grew shorter  farmers
          were able to work into the night in the brightness of Her light.

          OCTOBER

                    Atthis timeof yearthe abundanceof fruit andvegetables begins
          to slow.  It is  a time when our ancient ancestors  gathered what they
          could store and then supplemented their Winter diets either by hunting
          wild animals or by slaughtering domestic ones.  So this Lunar month is
          called the Blood Moon.  As you  cast the Esbat Circle on this  moonlit
          Autumn night  and fill the cup with blood-red wine, know that you will
          be  joined in  the sacred  dance not  only by  the unseen  presence of
          departed friends and family so close at this time of year, but also by
          the  spirits of animals  as well, perhaps  of those that  have died so
          that  we may have food.  In  this age of assembly line slaughterhouses
          and meatpacking  plants, it  is especially  appropriate  that on  this
          night of the  Blood Moon we who are on the Pagan path ritually ask the
          understanding  of our animal sisters and brothers, bless them, and bid
          them merry meet, merry part, and merry meet again.

          NOVEMBER

                    As theWinter Sun wanes andthe Snow Moon waxesfull, cast your
          Circle in the warm glow of candlelight.  Salute  the Moon in Her snowy
          whiteness and breathe in the  coolness of Her light.  Become  as still
          as this Winter  night, and know  that the activity  of the warm  light
          months  is behind us.   Ahead are  the dark months  of the year.   The
          Spirit is most active when the body is most still.

          DECEMBER

                    The Full Moon nearestthe Winter Solstice is the OakMoon, the
          Moon of the newborn year, the Divine Child.  Like the Divine Child who
          is born to  die and dies to  be reborn anew,  the ancient Oak has  its
          trunk and  branches in  the material  world of the  living, while  its
          roots, the  branches  in  reverse,  reach deep  into  the  Underworld,
          symbolic  land of the  Spirit.  As  the roots probe  downward into the
          grave-like darkness of the Earth, its branches grow ever upward toward
          the light, to  be crowned by sacred Mistletoe.   At this most magickal
          time of the year, as the light of the old dying year wanes and the Oak
          Moon waxes to full, cast your  Circle wearing Mistletoe in your  hair.
          Let  this  token   remind  you  that  like  the  Oak,   we  too  dwell
          simultaneously in two  worlds - the world  of physical matter and  the
          world of Spirit.  As you invoke the Goddess of the Moon, ask  that you
          become ever  more aware of  the other side  of reality and  the unseen
          forces and beings that are  always among us.

                               Consciousness & Politics 

          Below is rough draft overview of my "worldview" as presented in the
          book I'm working on "CONSCIOUSNESS AND POLITICS".  It is definitely
          a "new age" interpretation of epistemology, metaphysics,
          metapsychology, ethics and politics.    Comments welcome.

          EPISTEMOLOGY: (how we find truth)  We must recognize that knowledge
          and truth will always be elusive and subjective.  As Rupert
          Sheldrake points out, even "natural laws" seem to be evolving.
          They are not static and unchanging.  A balance of intuition, reason
          and empirical methods must be applied in seeking knowledge in any
          field, though the appropriate balance of methods will depend on the
          field.  And these can be used to prove that some viewpoints are
          more accurate than others, even if they aren't the "ultimate, final
          truth".
               Today humans are becoming aware that humans "construct"
          reality, create truth, rather than discovering it.   Reality is not
          some objective, knowable entity created by God or natural law.  It
          is an evolving, ever-changing process.
               Individuals know reality through their particular
          personal/social/political "psychic grid".  What is important is for
          each of us to decide what psychic grid we choose to work from and
          how to change it if we choose.  Each of us can create
          philosophically/emotionally gratifying reality.  We don't have to
          just go along with what the power structure calls reality.

          METAPHYSICS:  (the nature and purpose of reality)  Consciousness is
          both the nature and the propose of reality.  I choose to call the
          nature and purpose of reality "consciousness" because the new
          sciences show principles like consciousness operate throughout
          reality. At the subatomic level I equate the dynamic, yang force
          with imagination and will, and the integrating, yin force with
          memory and creativity.  There is an inherent drive to evolve, for
          the propose of exploring full the potentials of consciousness, and,
          ultimately, to develop into fully self-conscious beings like
          ourselves.

               There may well be an ever evolving "morphogenetic field"
          of human consciousness.   Individual consciousness survive and
          passes from body to body over many life times in a process
          known as "reincarnation".
               The concept of consciousness must replace the concept of
          god. For if we know that consciousness is the basis of
          reality, and if we relate that to the fact that we all have
          consciousness, then it is obvious to all that we are the
          personification of natural, not "divine" principles of
          reality. The word god just confuses people, making them think
          that there is some divinity apart from and above from
          themselves.
               Moreover, as experience has shown, the concept of god is
          so easily corrupted by authoritarianism as to be worse than
          useless -- ie. totally counter-productive.  How many people
          have been persecuted and murdered in the name of this, that or
          the other "god"??
               People of good will must recognize this and give up the
          word god.  We are the product of our own conscious evolution
          for our own conscious purposes.    We created ourselves -- and
          we did not create ourselves to live in ignorance of that fact
          or to make ourselves suffer!!


                                                                            1074
          

          METAPSYCHOLOGY: (spiritual psychology)  We know that the human
          brain is really three brains: the original reptilian and
          mammalian brains controlling automatic and reflexive survival
          functions, and, heaped over these, the unique human "neo-
          cortex" which contains enormous intellectual and creative
          potentials.
               Humans do not have to be content to be ruled by their
          "lower brains," by their most basic needs for survival,
          procreation and status.  Abraham Maslow points out there is a
          psychological need hierarchy.  If humans remain stuck on
          fulfilling the lower needs (safety, belonging, esteem) and
          ignore fulfillment of the higher needs (self-actualization,
          humanistic values, peak experiences) they become frustrated,
          obsessive, and addicted -- to food, drink, sex, power, money.
               The need hierarchy and the concept of chakras describe
          essentially the same phenomena.  Humans rise up the need
          hierarchy or chakras in 3 ways: 1) by being aware that they in
          fact exist; 2) by creating a culture which suggests simple, as
          opposed to extravagant, definition of what fulfillment of
          these basic needs are and then creates institutions which make
          sure these basic need are fulfilled; 3) by having myths,
          symbols, and rituals which reinforce the existence and
          fulfillment of all human physical, emotional and spiritual
          needs.
               Cultures worldwide have too little of the knowledge,
          attitudes and structures needed to boost us up our need
          hierarchies.  However, through education and meditation humans
          can develop their higher brain, move up the need hierarchy,
          rise to higher consciousness.  They can lose the desire for
          obsessive material accumulation, develop a tolerance for
          individual diversity, experience love and connectedness with
          all living things, give up the need to dominate, exploit or
          direct them, fulfill their individual potentials and even
          experience cosmic consciousness, cosmic ecstasy.


          ETHICS:  (What values we should pursue, how we should act
          towards one and other)  I believe in a yin-yang ethical
          system.  One in which hedonism/self-actualization are the yang
          goals, and utilitarian "what's best for all" the yin goals.
               I believe our actions towards one and other must also be
          very "yin-yang".  The yang is the libertarian view that the
          individual is free to do as she/he pleases as long as she/he
          doe not harm others.  The yin is non-violence, cooperation and
          mutual aid.  They are both necessary and totally
          complementary.


                                                                            1075
          

          POLITICS:  We must begin to understand Gandhi's message that
          all conflicts - personal and political, individual and group,
          local, regional and global - should be resolved through non-
          violent mediation instead of police and military violence.
          Today's great nation states  have been created and maintained
          by violence.  Without violence they, would crumble, to be
          replaced by networks of non-violent communities.
               Individuals must be free to establish or choose their own
          ethical system and then join in free, self-governing
          communities with those who share those views.  However, this
          "yang" commmunitarianism must be complemented by the "yin"
          values of non-violent conflict resolution between communities
          and mutual aid to all afflicted humans, whateve their
          community.
               Our means to creating this society should be nonviolent
          as the ends we seek.  We should be assertive as possible,
          starting as soon as possible.

                                  A Mother's Day Message 

          Everyone has a mother.  She is usually regarded with much love and
          affection, as the benign, loving presence in our childhood. That is,
          unless she was abusive, in which case her kids usually write books
          about her later.  But who could forget the apprehension and downright
          FEAR you'd have if you had pulled your sister's hair, or written on
          the walls with a crayon, or got caught snitching a cookie from the
          cookie jar. The fear was not that of an innocent victim of
          oppression, but of a wrongdoer facing just punishment.  The fear and
          loathing would inevitably subside after your behind would stop
          smarting, and she'd be back to being Benevolent Mom again.
               As it is with our mother, so is it with the  Earth Mother.  Those
          who live in harmony with Her prosper, their needs met from Her bounty.
          Those who do violence to Her, however, risk Her wrath.  The Mother is
          not just mild Demeter and sweet Parvati, but dark Hecate, the fierce
          Durga, and the absolutely horrifying Kali. She cares for us and loves
          us, and Her patience is near boundless. But Her patience has limits. 
          We live in a  time when more rape has been perpetrated  on Her than in
          any  other  time of  our existance  as a  species.  Her Body  has been
          defiled by mining  and over-building. Her  exhalations have been  made
          foul by the smoke of cars and factories. And from Her Sacred Body, the
          Anglo has extracted  what could  be the seeds  of our  extinction--the
          Uranium used in both weapons production and nuclear power.  The sacred
          Hopi prophecies speak of the world being defiled by "...a bowl full of
          ashes."  This  could  mean  the various  atmospheric  and  underground
          detonations  of nuclear  weapons, or  the accidents  at  Chernobyl and
          Three Mile Island.
               I  believe that this  Bowl Full Of  Ashes is not  only these, but
          refers to all the destruction we  have wrought on Our Mother.   I have
          had some  information revealed to me,  in a way that  seems to suggest
          that  the Mother  was speaking  to  me, both  through  Big Dreams  and
          through an uncanny transmission  I got while hanging out  at Sepulveda
          Dam Basin.  This is not a boast--this is something which I simply HAVE
          to talk about. We  who strive to walk  in harmony with The  Mother, be
          you Wiccan, or Shamanist, or just someone who cares, have an awesome
          responsibility.  Putting it simply, we are the ONLY FORCE STANDING
          BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AND HER RIGHTEOUS WRATH. 
               Our  efforts might  not  be entirely  enough  to stay  Her  fury,
          considering  the  dramatic  upswing  in natural  disasters  that  have
          occured over the  last 10 years, but it  is obvious that WE  MUST TRY.
          Shamanism has been "rediscovered"  for a very basic reason.   It means
          the  possibility of healing this Planet and regaining awareness of Our
          Mother's will.  We must guard against this tradition being bastardized
          and  cheapened  by those  who commercialize  these  ways, and  be very
          careful  to not fall into the trap of  honoring Mother to the point of
          forgetting  the Sky Father, and forgetting that both Mother and Father
          are the ways that The Source Of All is revealed to us in a form we can
          understand.  We must  also be careful to  whom we reveal  information,
          being mindful  that an unstable mind  given some of this  knowledge is
          EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. But most importantly, Our Mother is calling us to
          restore our link with Her, and to work towards her healing.  We have a
          lot of work ahead of us.  Our very lives depend on it.
          For The Earth Mother...ALWAYS!!!!!

                             Memory, A Proposed New Model 

         We will be usinga chart based on a simplified model of Laser Holography
     to look  at the nature   of consciousness and  memory.  This  model will be
     very  simplified, but  necessitate  a brief  layman's  introduction to  the
     principles  of physics  involved in  holography.   It is  no accident  that
     mystics and  wise men of all  ages have often spoken  about certain aspects
     of mental and spiritual activity, as well as knowledge in terms relating to
     light.  Please keep  in mind that this is  a MODEL only, and will  fall far
     short of expressing the true complexity of the subject.

                                          MIRROR        SCREEN 
      
          The  characteristic of a laser  that makes it so useful  is that it is
     the  source  of "pure" or coherent  light.  "Normal" light is composed   of
     many  frequencies  which  are  all jumbled together and out of phase.   Try
     to picture the set of ripples generated in a still pool  of water when just
     one pebble is dropped in.   All  of the wave crests are equidistant and  in
     phase and highly regular, aren't they?  This is analogous to laser light.  
     Now  picture the same pool,  only toss in a  random handful of pebbles, the
     results are quite  different aren't  they?  This  is analogous to  "normal"
     light. 
          
          The  laser generates coherent light  which enters a  prism that splits
     the  beam in two:   (1)  the Reference Beam,  and  (2) the  Working Beam.  
     The working beam  is, in turn, reflected from a  mirror and redirected back
     to the object  being illuminated.   When the wave  fronts of the  two beams
     collide  on  the surface, they  create an  "interference pattern" which  is
     reflected  to the  screen   or  photographic    plate.   This  interference
     pattern, when properly  viewed, recreates  the 3 dimensional  image of  the
     original object. 
      
          At  first look,  one  might well  say: "O.K.,this  works  well for  an
     explanation of  a laser light  show, but what  bearing does it have  on the
     operation and function of  the human mind?"   I see  the symbolism in  this
     model as follows:
          1) The coherent  light is the "light" or conscious(ness) energy of the
     Aether, sort of the "Universal Mind" if you will.
          2>  The Prism  symbolizes  two of  the  directional functions  of  the
     "Higher Self; that of illuminating both the object form its own standpoint,
     and of providing "light" (consciousness) for the Mirror.
          3. The Mirror represents a  function of the sub conscious mind  in the
     creation of "attention" or focusing of consciousness on the world.


                                                                            1078
     

          4. The  Screen (photographic  plate) is the  storage mechanism/process
     for what we call memory.
     Therefore the  Prism,  Mirror, and  Screen  may all  be  used to  symbolize
     certain portions of the mind or mental processes in a human being.
          Because the Prism, Mirror,and  screen are a part of the individual and
     unique  to  that  individual,   the  actual  "records"  or   memories  (and
     consciousness) of the same event or object will vary a great  deal form one
     individual to another.   None of  these functions exists in  isolation from
     the others, so  there is  a process  of "feedback"  going on  at all  times
     between them.  The nature of  the recorded "images" will "color" and modify
     both the  prism and the mirror, thereby modifying the quqlity of all future
     images, memories, or recordings.  This is one of the  reasons that memories
     of past events  can color or distort our present  perceptions of reality so
     thoroughly.
          One of  our tasks (many would call it a  "Great Work") in our lifetime
     is to try to "purify" or refine the quality  of the Prism function, so that
     the  "light" that  forms the  "working beam"  is as  close to  identical in
     quality to  the "reference beam" as  possible.  Some call  this process tha
     attaining of consciousness of the Higher Self.  Another task is to "polish"
     and learn control over the  mirror function so that the reference  beam may
     be directed more  precisely and with little or (ideally) no distortion upon
     the objects/events of our attention.  Yet a third task is to do our best to
     perfect the recording  mechanism of the  screen, in  order that the  meory-
     image be as faithful as possible to what was presented to it.
          Another  point  worth keeping  in  mind  at  this point  is  that  ALL
     memories,  no matter  how  distorted  and/or  "colored"  are  REAL  to  the
     individual  possessing  those memories.   This  fact  may well  explain the
     apparent  anomaly of people suffering from PROVABLE no-existent abuse at an
     early  age.   If a  traumatic and  non-understood (or  misunderstood) event
     occurs to an individual at an early age, the  only recording will be one of
     trauma and  an individual can be  easily "talked into" (by  self or others)
     putting  that  trauma into  a  frame  of reference  that  can be  presently
     understood.  The fact That a  meory is misunderstood, distorted, etc., does
     not make the any less "real" in their effect on the individual, and it must
     be dealt with as such.
          Another interesting point  is that these  "holgrams" or memory  images
     can cometogether  in a synergy where  the sum of the  parts becomes greater
     than the  whole in a process of "constellation" (in Jungian terms) and form
     whole "complexes" which take on  a (seeming?) life of their own.   If these
     complexes are encouraged to grow  and flourish, they can also be  percieved
     by (some) others as some sort of "other worldly beings" and can  be further
     fed  and strengthened  by others  until they  become Archetypal  in nature.
     This process could well be the  cause of many of the "Angels"  and "Demons"
     of the Christian and other Pantheons.

     ASCII MUSICAL NOTATION
     developed by Leigh Ann Hussey
     with help from Shadowthought and Josh Gordon

     Each  line  of  the  music  consists  of  4  lines  of  music.    The  time
     signature(s),
     the lines  between bars, and each  note take up one  column, with modifiers
     such
     as sharps, flats, and dots extending a note up to three columns.  The time
     signature is written  at the beginning in the obvious  way.  Three vertical
     bars
     (lines 2 to 4) mark the divisions between measures.  Lines 1 to 3 indicate
     note durations, as follows:

          1/16   1/8   1/4   1/2   dotted-1/2   1/8    1/4
          note   note  note  note     note      rest   rest
           =      _
           |      |     |     |        |         '      %
           |      |     |     o        o.

     Line 4 indicates the pitch.  The numbers 1 to 8 mark the octave including
     middle C (A through F);   1' to 8', one octave  above middle C;  1" to  8",
     two
     octaves above  middle C;  '1 to  '8, the  octave below  middle C. A  number
     followed
     by a  #  is a  sharp;  a number  followed  by a  lower-case  b is  a  flat.
     Underscores
     connecting a note to the next note indicate a slur.  Consider the following
     examples:

     Subject: Re: Lilith

            In response to your request for information on
       Lilith, I looked her up in "The Woman's Encyclopedia ofMyths and Secrets"
     by Barbara Walker and published by Harper and Row.  (1983).  This book was
     strongly recommended to  me by  a Dallas parapsychology  teacher, (male  at
     that), who felt I might enjoy and benefit  from this study of sexism, which
     is dealt with in the book from both historical and mythical viewpoints.

     I found this information, which I have paraphrased for the most part.

     Lilith, (also know as Lilit), was a relic of an early rabbinical attempt to
     assimilate the Sumero-Babylonian Goddess Belit-ili, or Belili, to Jewish
     mythology.  to the Canaanites, Lilith was Baalat, the "Divine Lady".
     Hebraic tradition said Adam married Lilith because he grew tired of mating
     with animals, a common custom of Middle-Eastern herdsmen, though the Old
     Testament declared it a sin.  Moslems were insistent on the male-superior
     sexual position and apparently  Lilith was not Moslem, disagreed  with Adam
     and flew away to the Red Sea.

     God sent angels to bring Lilith back, but she refused to return.  She
     supposedly spent her time mating with "demons" and gave birth to "a hundred
     children a day".  (Busy woman!) So God had to produce Eve as Lilith's more
     docile replacement.  Lilith became the "Great Mother" of settled tribes who
     resisted invasions of nomadic herdsmen represented by Adam.   Early Hebrews
     disliked the Great Mother who is said to have drank the blood of Abel after
     he was slain by Cain.

     Lilith's Red  Sea was another  version of Kali  Ma's Ocean of  Blood, which
     gave birth to all things.  There  may have been a connection between Lilith
     and the Etuscan divinity Leinth, who had no face and who waited at the gate
     of the underworld along with Eita and  Persipnei, (Hades and Persephone) to
     receive the souls of the dead.   The underworld gate was a yoni and a lily,
     which had no face.  Admission into the underworld was often mythologized as
     a sexual union.  The lily or lilu, (lotus)  was the Great Mother's flower -
     yoni, whose title formed Lilith's name.

     The  story of Lilith  disappeared from  the Bible,  but her  daughters, the
     lilim,  haunted  men for  over  a thousand  years.  The lilim  were thought
     responsible for nocturnal emissions and the Jews still made amulets to keep
     away the  lilim well  into the  Middle Ages. Greeks  adopted the  lilim and
     called  them, Lamiae,  Empusae, or  Daughters of  Hecate.   Christians also
     adopted them  and called them harlots  of hell or succubae.   They believed
     that Lilith  laughed every  time  a Christian  man has  a wet  dream.   The
     Daughters of Lilith were supposedly very beautiful and presumed to be so
     expert at lovemaking that after an experience with one, a man couldn't be
     content with a mere mortal woman.

     Thanks for the information about Lillith.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite
     answer my questions about Lillith, which are not so much what the  myth or
     legend is, as how was it propagated down thru history to us?

     A while ago, someone here suggested that Lillith was expunged from the
     Christian  Bible.   Others,  more knowledgeable  about  that than  I,  gave
     reasons   that  that  was  unlikely  as  a  Christian  era  event,  without
     postulating a  monumental conspiracy.  OK, if Lillith is at least as old as
     the bible,  how did  the myth  or legend  get propogated?   Was  there lost
     ancient written material?  Or was it propagated orally for many generations
     even  after some or  many of the  books of  the old testament  were written
     down?  Or did it arise later?

     As  for  the lovemaking  of  the daughters  of  Lillith, sounds  kinda fun.
     (Maybe we should  ask David Rice  about that?)   Do the  sons of Pan  spoil
     mortal women as well?  :-)

     Barbara  Walker's  Encyclopedia  is  interesting,  but  seldom  gives  very
     thorough sources.   It is apparently  worth keeping that  grain of salt  on
     hand.

     I just got her Tarot cards & book; pretty powerful images, I thought.   I
     haven't tried a reading with them yet.

     Thanks for the info!

          As I understand it, Lilith is said to be as old as the bible, because
     she is mentioned in the Mishna, a form of commentary on the Pentateuch.
     Whether she was ever in what is now canonical, i.e. Genesis per se, is hard
     to prove or disprove. The Mishna was an oral tradition for much longer. She
     has been  identified with  Ishtar in much  the same ce"  way as  Mercury to
     Thoth  to  Wotan.  I  don't  think  there  is  a  literal  or  philological
     connection.

          Lillith  is mentioned in an  esoteric Jewish text  called the Midrash.
     It is a  compilation of mystical interpretations surrounding the Torah (old
     Testament).  It was  handed down orally along  with the rest of the  Talmud
     and was written down in the middle ages when the Rabbis thought that these
     teachings might be forgotten.

                Apparently Lillith was created at the same time as Adam (see the
     initial  reference to the creation of man  "Man and Woman" he created them)
     but somehow disappeared from the scene due to her rebelious nature.

          I think that she was probably the primary Goddess in the region prior
     to the  advent and revolution  of the  Jehovah followers.   I also tend  to
     believe that Innana was one of her descendants.

          The  only Lilith likely  to be  found in  _my_ family  huluppu-tree is
     Lilith Velkor... :-)

          On a more sirius note (even though I don't use Sirius any more; I use
     Gnome), there is no question that Inanna is a third- or later-generation
     goddess  in the  Sumerian pantheon.   I  rather suspect  that the  image of
     Inanna as THE Goddess before whom all other deities at least swear a little
     fealty comes from Uruk.  Inanna was the matron goddess of Uruk, and most of
     our legends and such concerning  her were dug up (literally) in  Uruk.  The
     myth of the  huluppu-tree shows a young Inanna, in a  young Uruk, trying to
     get help from other deities  of other, older cities to get rid of a problem
     that was too big  for her to handle at the time.   The problem is solved by
     Gilgamesh, King of Uruk, rather than  by any foreigner.  Likewise, the tale
     of Inanna & Enki & the _me's_  (civic virtues), shows a young goddess of  a
     young city  who has managed to  elevate her city  into the first rank.   In
     winning the _me's_ from Enki, Inanna adds to them by the  time she gets her
     virtuous cargo back to Uruk.   I do not recall whether Lilith  was formally
     mentioned as being in Inanna's lineage, though.

     that?)

     Er, were  you  interested  in  some  phone  numbers?    It's
     extreamly hard work to love a daughter of  Lilith,  but  the
     rewards are undeniably worth it.

     I've  started  an  extended study on strong Lilith women vs.
     the domesticated Eve ones.   So  far,  with  only  about  18
     tallies  in  (painstakingly  and  personaly  researched with
     great, er, debauch, with plans on adding  many  hundreds  of
     more into the study), the following has been observed:

     Most  American  men give out long before the Lilithian woman
     (or any other) will.  Lilith will say "Excuse me, kind sir,"
     (as she can't remember his name at the moment). "You're  not
     finished, are you?!" and Eve will say "Gee, that was great!"
     and  reach  for the batteries and flee into the bathroom for
     an hour.

     Lesbians tend to be strongly Lilithian.  This may be because
     "the only thing men are good FOR they aren't  good  AT,"  as
     the true  and  valid saying goes.  Also, most if not all men
     are little cry babies,  and  Lilith  can't  stand  for  that
     nonsence.

     Conversly,  Eve  women always knew men make horrible lovers,
     but resign themselves to 4 minutes of sex twice a week, when
     they'd rather have 16 hours of sex every day.  This is  why,
     perhaps, Eveian women make such good Catholics.

     If your typical male pig says, rightly, that a woman's place
     is  in  the bed, Lilith will say "Eat shit and die!" and Eve
     will say "Yes, dear," and hate herself.

                            The WICCAN INFORMATION NETWORK


     What is WIN?

          The  Wiccan Information Network is  a project of  the Wiccans Invoking
     Tolerance, Compassion, and Harmony Society (W.I.T.C.H.).  The WITCH Society
     is  a registered society  in the province  of British Columbia.   The WITCH
     Society  works to support the  right of Pagans  (including Goddess Worship-
     pers) and Witches  to practice  their faith as  they see  fit, as it  falls
     within the Craft, civil, and  criminal law and does not infringe in any way
     on the rights of others.  WITCH  is working toward the return of the Wiccan
     and  Pagan religions as respected  faiths in society  through education via
     the media and by public discussion.
          The Wiccan Information Network is a  non denominational Wiccan project
     sponsored by  the WITCH  Society.   The WIN project  is coordinated  by the
     police  liaison committee of WITCH.   The WIN  coordinators are responsible
     for coordinating the efforts of those involved in the project.  WIN is made
     up of Wiccans from all over North America and includes many Wiccans who are
     law enforcement officers.

     What are the objectives of WIN?

          The objectives of the Wiccan Information Network are:

               1. To monitor anti-Wiccan activities, groups and individuals;

               2. To research occult related crime;

               3. To distribute this intelligence to those in the Wiccan 
     community that are affected by it; and

               4.To liaise with  law enforcement  agencies in  order to  provide
     them with accurate information on Pagan religions and occult 
     related crime.  

     How does WIN work?

          The  WIN  coordinators have  assigned  area  coordinators to  specific
     regions in the US  and Canada.  WIN members forward  any anti Wiccan infor-
     mation that  they come  across  to their  area coordinators.   These  coor-
     dinators investigate this information and forward it to:

               1) Pagan groups in their areas affected by this information;

               2) Area coordinators of other areas affected; and

               3) The WIN coordinators.

          The WIN coordinators analyze and collate all intelligence received and
     assign  area coordinators to  follow-up tasks if necessary.   The WIN coor-
     dinators send out a monthly intelligence summary to WIN members.


                                                                            1088

     What else does WIN do?

          The Wiccan Information Network also:

               1) Publishes information booklets and manuals for law enforcement
               investigators;

               2) Publishes resource directories  for those seeking  information
     or speakers on Pagan beliefs or occult related crime;

               3) Arranges public speaking engagements in order to brief members
               of the Pagan community on the subjects studied by WIN.

     Do I have to join WIN to participate?

          No.  You don't need  to join WIN to help us.  All that  you need to do
     is  send us any information,  newspaper clippings, articles,  etc. that you
     feel we should be aware of.   We'll make sure this information gets to  the
     right people.

     Who receives the monthly WIN intelligence summary?

          Only  WITCH  Society  members,  WIN project  members,  selected  Pagan
     newsletters and Pagan organizations affiliated with WIN receive the monthly
     intelligence summary.  You cannot subscribe to it, for security reasons.
     If you'd like to become a member  of WITCH the current dues are $25 (Canad-
     ian) per annum, which  includes notice of meetings by mail and subscription
     to the  WITCH Society  newsletter.   A copy of  the WITCH  constitution and
     bylaws is available upon request  if you send a stamped and  self addressed
     envelope.

     How can I become involved in WIN?

          You don't have to belong to WITCH to be a part of WIN, although  it is
     preferred.  If  you are  interested in becoming  a part of  WIN you  should
     contact the WIN coordinator  with a rsum  of your previous experience  in
     anti defamation work for  the Wiccan community.  Organizations  or newslet-
     ters interested in obtaining WIN intelligence summaries  should contact the
     WIN coordinator in writing  and send information on their  constitution and
     editorial policies.
          Donations to  assist us  in  our work  are greatly  appreciated.   All
     donations should be forwarded to the WITCH Society and all checks should be
     made payable to the WITCH Society.

     An Open Letter to Selena Fox
                                   by Isaac Bonewits
         
      Dear Selena:
      ...
      A few months ago I received a mailing from Circle in which you
      asked for (a) money to finish paying off the mortgage for the land
      Circle has been buying for many years, (b) suggestions for
      fund raising methods, and (c) "ideas and suggestions" as to how
      Circle should grow.
         
      I also read the mailings put out earlier this year by the
      "revolutionary" members of Circle, including the transcript of the
      meeting between them, yourself, and your lawyer. Confused,
      puzzled, and pained, I talked to you and to your supporters and
      opponents, including former workers at your headquarters. The more
      I learned, the more disturbed I became.
         
      Apparently, you are an intensely private person and have always
      resented people looking at what you consider your personal
      business. Yet my concern for Circle is not gossip, nor is it (as
      you put it to me) "sticking my nose where it doesn't belong."
      Circle is large, international, and has served a unique networking
      function in our community. If you don't know by now that what
      happens to you matters to us all, and that you have become a
      "public figure" in our community, then you've seriously
      underestimated your own importance.
         
      For many, many Neopagans, Circle was a doorway to the Goddess
      and to Her people. Our community would be considerably smaller, if
      it hadn't been for the work that Circle did for so many years.
      That you have been one of the most widely respected, loved, and
      trusted leaders in the Neopagan community, makes this letter
      especially painful to write.
         
      Circle was one of the first groups to buy land for Neopagan use.
      For years I championed your cause, both because I felt that land
      purchases were an inevitable evolutionary step for our community
      and because of the undeniably good work you had done as a
      networking organization. I recommended you to correspondents who
      wanted contacts and pointed you out as an example of a Neopagan
      group that had obtained real estate without getting corrupted.
         
      I no longer feel that I can support you or Circle, or advise
      others to do so. The change in my attitude has come about slowly,
      over a period of several years, with the recent events
      crystallizing my perceptions. Things add up...
         
      After years of correctly telling folks at gatherings not to take
      photographs of people without their permission, especially
      during rituals, you still run around during ceremonies (ignoring
      the spiritual energies being raised and focussed), or even at
      skyclad bonfire dances, snapping pictures for your slide
      collection and Circle Network News. Some of those slides have been
      shown to strangers all around the country, other photos were
      published in C.N.N. and even in non-Pagan publications -- at least
      some without the consent of the people depicted. This is only one
      example of an apparently pervasive attitude you seem to have that
      the rules you impose on others simply don't apply to yourself.


                                                                            1090

         
      Other examples: After refusing to pay the expenses of other
      Neopagan teachers to attend and speak at Circle's well-financed
      events, you always demand red-carpet treatment for yourself and
      your husband to attend and present workshops at events held by
      others. Despite being constantly recommended by other Neopagan
      individuals and organizations, you seldom recommend any teacher or
      group other than yourself and Circle. After building the "Church
      of Circle Wicca" as one of the most famous Wiccan churches in the
      world, you unilaterally decided this year to drop "the W word" --
      a position I tend to support for the community at large, but one
      which seems to leave your thousands of Wiccan members without a
      voice. You then attempted to declare a copyright on the
      wide-spread concept of Nature mysticism.
         
      Circle has a reputation as an all-inclusive Neopagan networking
      organization, yet former Circle workers agree that, for at least
      five years, you discouraged them from giving networking contacts
      to inquirers, instead having them sell the Circle Guide to Pagan
      Groups and ads in C.N.N. Apparently this was originally because
      doing referrals took too much time out of the limited number of
      volunteer-hours you had available, yet you never announced to the
      community that you had stopped providing local Neopagan contacts,
      or what you had decided was a higher priority. Worse, after a loud
      argument with one of Circle's critics, you censored his
      organization's listings out of the 1990 Guide. Even if this was
      done with his consent (as one witness claims), it was grossly
      inappropriate for a reference work that many people believe to be
      a complete listing of Neopagan resources.
         
      You bought Circle Sanctuary with donations sent by thousands of
      Neopagans, originally claiming that it would be open and available
      for general use by the community, and then fenced it about with so
      many restrictions that it has become essentially your private
      property. A half-dozen ex-workers at Circle agreed that it was
      nearly impossible for ordinary Neopagans to visit "their"
      sanctuary for religious purposes without providing money and/or
      free labor to you at the same time. Amazingly enough, one couple 
      on the west coast claims that after donating over $5,000 to Circle
      they were refused permission to visit the land because they had a
      small child with them!
         
      Circle's by-laws have never been published, so no one knows for
      sure who is or isn't a "member" of Circle for voting purposes, nor
      how your board of directors gets elected. You told me that there
      have been and are other members of your board of directors
      (besides yourself, your husband Dennis and your lawyer), but
      declined to give me the current names. Your opponents tell me that
      this "secret board of directors" is a story you've told for years,
      but I was able to verify the names of two people who have been
      directors in the past. Apparently your policy is simply to have
      the board consist of you, your spouse (first Jim and now Dennis)
      and one other person -- a handy way to make sure that you retain
      majority control.


                                                                            1091

      There are also legitimate questions about the enormous sums of
      money that have flowed through your hands over the years. I have
      been informed, by extremely reliable sources, that you have used
      one of Circle's checking accounts as a personal one, that normal
      financial books don't exist and never have, that Dennis' education
      has been paid for in large part out of Circle's general funds, and
      that he forbid workers at your headquarters to open the mail
      because they had been asking questions about incoming bank
      statements. Further, Dennis has been quoted mentioning a secret
      fund that would provide for your personal survival, should Circle
      ever fold.
         
      When I brought some of these allegations up to you in our
      conversation, you denied a few of them directly and evaded
      responding to others. As an investigative journalist and a
      concerned member of the Neopagan community, I have no way of
      knowing how many of these very serious accusations against you may
      be true -- but without published financial reports, neither does
      anybody else! Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been donated
      to Circle over the years, yet no one seems to know where it has
      all gone, and you're not saying. You told me that neither federal
      nor Wisconsin law requires you to file or publish financial
      reports. Yet hadn't it ever occurred to you that sooner or later
      the people who had been giving you all that money would want to
      know what you had done with it -- and that they would have a moral
      right to know?
         
      When the broken-hearted people who thought they were members of
      Circle tried to confront you over these issues of power and
      accountability, your response was to bring in a lawyer who reacted
      to all criticism and questioning with threatened lawsuits. At
      that meeting you danced around the issues that people brought up,
      never giving a straight answer to any question. Instead you
      focused on your anger towards those who had used Circle's mailing
      list to share their fears and concerns. Your comments on all of
      this in Circle Network News omitted most of the serious criticism
      that had been laid against you and Circle, and implied that
      nothing negative was happening. Your phone conversation with me
      consisted of a few direct denials, dozens of evasions, efforts to
      pump me for my sources, and repeated threats of unspecified
      legal and other troubles for me and my organization (Ar nDraiocht
      Fein: A Druid Fellowship, Inc. -- "ADF") if I persisted in my
      plans to publish the results of my investigation.

      This behavior is not what we expect from a world-famous Neopagan
      organization run by someone many consider to be a Neopagan
      saint. What has gone wrong? I am inevitably reminded of the
      scandals surrounding the P.T.L. organization and the fact that no
      Christian leader was willing to criticize the Bakkers until after
      the media exposed them. The scandal almost destroyed the entire
      field of televangelism. That might seem good to Neopagans, but
      now the shoes are on our feet.
      


                                                                            1092

      Now it's one of our leaders who seems to be behaving in an
      unethical and irresponsible manner. What should we do, Selena?
      Should we all be silent and pretend that nothing is wrong, while
      we hope for your problems to go away by themselves? Should we wait
      until Circle blows up in our faces, strengthening the biases of
      those who are opposed to the very idea of large public Neopagan
      churches? Should we wait until you are investigated by hostile
      outside forces, making it infinitely harder for other Neopagans to
      get fair treatment -- and no doubt leading to yet another
      fund-raising campaign to protect you from "anti-Pagan
      persecution"? Most importantly, would such inaction on our part
      benefit the community or the Earth?
         
      I'm not saying that ADF and I are perfect in regard to all these
      issues. ADF's finances were confused for several years, first
      because I was paying out of my own pocket for most of our expenses
      (and seldom kept receipts), and later because our bookkeeper was
      an inexperienced volunteer (now we have a professional accountant
      on the Board). We have not always delivered on time the products
      or publications that we promised our members. But, by the Gods,
      when we have made mistakes, we have admitted it. We publish our
      by-laws so that all our members know the rules to our game, we
      print financial statements to let our members know how their money
      is spent, and we make available the minutes from our Board
      meetings so everyone will know how and why decisions are made.
      When our members have offered legitimate complaints about how we
      have handled things, we have listened carefully and then tried to
      respond appropriately.
         
      I will admit to some envy of you and Circle. When I think of all
      the good that might have been accomplished by ADF (or by any of a
      dozen other public Neopagan churches) if we had one-half of
      your income, I get both sad and angry. I've spent my entire adult
      life, as have other Neopagan leaders, living far below the
      economic level that my skills could earn me, surviving on an
      income less than that of most members of the Neopagan community --
      just so I could devote myself to the work I believe the Gods want
      me to do. It infuriates me to see enough money flowing into Circle
      to staff three Neopagan churches with full-time clergy, vanishing
      into fairyland without a trace. Of course it's obvious, to
      everyone who knows you, that you and Dennis are not living
      luxuriously. This makes the vanishing money all the more
      puzzling.
         
      I realize that you are not going to appreciate my criticism and
      that I am now on your enemies list for the rest of my life. It
      doesn't matter. I would be betraying both the Earth Mother and my
      own principles if I didn't speak out before matters get even
      worse.

      You have publicly asked for suggestions as to how Circle should
      grow. You've said that you want to put the past behind you and
      concentrate, as always, on "positive energies." OK, here are some
      positive steps you and Circle could take:
         
      Start by admitting, in your own publications, so that all your
      followers will hear you, that Circle has made some serious
      mistakes and that you are a fallible human being.
         
      Adopt and publish a set of by-laws that lets people know who the


                                                                            1093

      members of Circle are, and what voting rights, if any, they may
      have.
         
      Put several more people on your Board of Directors and publish
      their names, and let us all know how and why they got there. They
      don't all have to be in your local area -- telephone conference
      calls work just fine for Board meetings.
         
      If you haven't already done so, open a separate personal
      checking account for yourself and your husband. Have someone other
      than you or Dennis write the checks for Circle. If you've both
      taken vows of poverty to the church, and are therefore entitled to
      be supported by it, say so. Hire a full-time bookkeeper (you can
      afford the wages), and publish quarterly financial reports. Hire a
      C.P.A. to run an inventory on all Circle's property and publish
      the results. Publish the details on all the land payments you have
      made and how much is still owed.
         
      Design, publish and implement a training system for your clergy
      so that someone other than you and Dennis can be leaders someday.
      Make sure that you both genuinely qualify under the training
      system standards yourselves.
         
      If you're going to continue to present Circle as a networking
      organization, put all your names and addresses into a database,
      add confidentiality safe- guards as requested, update the list
      frequently, and share this data with those who write in and
      request it. Otherwise you should announce to the community that
      you aren't doing referrals anymore, and why.
         
      Publish a detailed explanation of your policies for controlling
      access to the Circle Sanctuary so that people who have donated
      money will know under what circumstances they may use the land
      they have paid for.
         
      Except for the last point, these are all things that we in ADF
      have done or are now trying to do. Many other Neopagan groups have
      done some of them. They are normal for most mainstream churches,
      large and small. Your local Unitarian Universalist congregation
      can probably give you advice on the details. Or you could ask the
      folks at any of a dozen other large Neopagan groups, most of whom
      have been doing these sorts of things for years.

      When I talked to you on the phone, you said that you were
      planning on publishing by-laws and financial reports, and making
      other major changes, before the end of the year. You said that
      turning 40 (as I did last year) and other brushes with mortality
      had turned your thoughts towards setting up Circle to run without
      you. Yet I find it hard to believe that you will take the
      necessary steps without the glare of a community spotlight being
      focussed on you -- hence this open letter. If you can prove me
      wrong and make all the organizational changes that are necessary
      to turn Circle into something we can all be proud of again, I will
      be delighted.
         
      Perhaps more important than these organizational steps, you
      might consider taking a sabbatical for a year or two, and turning
      Circle over to someone you still trust. You need to get back in
      touch with your roots, with the ideals that brought you to
      Neopaganism in the first place.


                                                                            1094

      But don't expect people in the Neopagan community to continue
      sending you hundreds of thousands of dollars until you have proven
      beyond a reasonable doubt that Circle is open, honest, democratic,
      and financially responsible.
         
      May the Gods bless, heal, and inspire you.
         
                                                                      
         --Isaac
         
      A PS to my fellow Neopagans:
         
      I'm sure that the preceding opinions have shocked and offended
      many of you, especially those of you who love Selena. It is only
      after much meditation and pain that I have decided to publish this
      letter as widely as possible in the Neopagan community. We need to
      discuss the issues in depth, both to help heal Circle and to
      prevent such trouble from happening again to other groups. Perhaps
      we need to develop a detailed code of ethics for running the
      increasing number of public Neopagan churches. Perhaps we need a
      fair and practical listing of what sort of behavior we expect from
      our leaders    -- as part of a "Neopagan Common Law."
         
      I hope that you will meditate upon the issues and discuss them
      with your friends. Ask the leaders of any large Neopagan group you
      may belong to whether they have taken steps similar to those I
      have suggested to Selena. Then write to the publication in which
      you read this. Send a copy of your thoughts to Selena at Circle,
      P.O. Box 219, Mt. Horeb, WI 53572. Send another copy to me at P.O.
      Box 9420, Newark, DE 19714, marked "Circle Controversy." The
      editor of The Druids' Progress has agreed to publish a fair
      representation of the responses in the next issue of D.P., along
      with any reply that Selena may care to make.
         
      Please don't respond to this open letter by criticizing me or
      ADF. As I have admitted many times in the past, I have feet of
      clay going up to my waist, have a gigantic ego, and have made many
      mistakes in running ADF and other Neopagan organizations over the
      years. My virtues or vices are not relevant to the situation at
      Circle, nor is my rudeness in pointing matters out in public that
      many would prefer to keep private.

      Circle's current problems represent an inevitable growth stage,
      not just for itself and Selena, but for the community as a whole.
      As our population soars, we are faced with important questions
      about power, accountability, and ethics. Whether or not Selena is
      willing to honestly and openly address the issues, it's about time
      that the rest of us started thrashing them out. Perhaps after
      discussing this with your friends, you may want to make some
      changes in your own groups. Indeed, the situation at Circle has
      already sparked some major policy revisions and new by-laws for
      ADF and other Neopagan churches as well.  I'm definitely not
      saying that Neopagans should stop giving money to our growing
      number of public Neopagan churches. After all, large scale acti-
      vities do require large scale resources. What I am suggesting is
      that we boycott groups who ask for large donations (or small ones
      constantly), until we see their by-laws, financial reports, and
      minutes of their board meetings. This is the simple sort of common
      sense that any consumer advocate would advise. If we're going to
      give financial, emotional, political, or magical support to a


                                                                            1095

      group, let's make sure that it's being run in a publicly
      accessible, honest, and responsible manner. Otherwise, we're no
      wiser than the folks who kept the Bakkers in business for so
      long.
         
      Let's all pay careful attention to Selena's response to this
      open letter. Will she send out a mass mailing telling her
      followers that everything is fine and to "think positive"? Will
      she try to sue me for daring to voice concerns held by many? Will
      she publish negative gossip about me (there's plenty available) in
      an attempt to discredit my criticism and avoid answering my
      questions? Will she simply ignore this letter, knowing that the
      vast majority of her support comes from new members of the
      community who will not have read it? Or will she deal forthrightly
      with the issues involved and open Circle up to democratic
      participation by its members? Only time will tell.
         
      On a personal note, I'd like to ask the members of the Neopagan
      community to stop expecting our leaders, national or local, to be
      infallible, impeccable, infinitely strong, Neopagan saints.
      Almost all of us come from dysfunctional families, are survivors
      of various forms of abuse, and/or have had problems with
      addiction, obsession, or eating disorders. We are all subject to
      depression and professional burnout. This is the same profile
      shared by clergy in other religions and people in other helping
      professions. As leaders, we need your love, your understanding,
      and your support (financial, emotional, and spiritual). We also
      need your compassionate and thoughtful criticism to warn us when
      we start to go off the deep end. Hubris, the overwhelming pride
      that offends the Gods, can be caused by uncritical followers as
      easily as by our own egos, with disastrous results for our whole
      community.
         
      As Selena has shown us.

                             Daring        Silence
                                
                                             
                                             
                                            
                                             
                                             
                                
                            Knowledge       Will

                      To Know, To Will, To Dare, To Keep Silent
          To Know:
              Knowledge is the first key in any magickal working.  We must know
              what we want to do, and how to do it with skill.
          To Will:
               The focus of will provides the external energy necessary to do
               Work.
          To Dare:
                    This is the "doing" of the magickal operation, sometimes not
          without risk or effort.
          To Keep Silent:
               Do not "diffuse" the energies of ANY working by "talking it to
                    death", PARTICULARLY with those not directly involved or con
          cerned  with the operation.
          These four elements form a dynamic interaction with each other and the
          work or object  of the work represented by the  "Point" of the pyramid
          if you visualize this diagram in three dimensions, rather than the two
          of the  computer screen.  These seem  to be fundamental principles for
          group ritual as well as solitary spellwork.

                                     The Thorn Ritual 

               The Runic Sub-Committee of the Orgone Committee has been
          working on many facets of the Runic Magical System in the past
          four years. The following ritual is the result of many months
          of discussion and work. May it serve you well.
           
           
               Set-up:
           
                      One's Runic Wand (or fingers if one is not available)
                      A place in which to cast the circle...
                      Meditation on the aspects of the Thorn (Thuriaz) Rune
                      
               Sit quietly in the space in which the cirle is to be cast.
               Meditate on the various aspects of the Thorn rune (consult
          various sources such as Thorrson's Futhark, F. Asswyn's Tree
          Yggdrasil, and N. Pennick's Runic Astrology). Concentrate on the
          passive and active protective aspects of the force embodied int 
          the Thorn Rune.
           
               Stand Facing North.
               Assume the Isa stance, hands at side and feet together.
               Visualize yourself as an antennae for the forces of the
          Multiverse. Feel the forces flowing through you from above and
          below. Let the energy flow through your body from the floor and
          the sky passing your solar plexus and energizing it.
               When you feel that the energy is flowing smoothly through
          your body visualize the space around you as deep blue. The deep
          blue of the late night sky. Shimmering with energy. Scintillating
          as you look in to it.
               Inhale evenly and deeply from you diaphram (letting your stomach
          expand and contract with your breath. Do not allow your upper body
          to be moved by the intake of breath. Let the sides of your mid section
          and the back of your midsection expand and contract with your breath.
          Breath fully and calmly. Let the breath energize your cells. Feel 
          the energy adding to the energy raised with the Isa meditation.
            
               Trace the Hammer of Thor with your dominant hand using the
          wand or your fingers...

                                      I

                               _______________
           
               As you trace the Thorn, say (vibrate) the word Thorn (or 
          Thuriaz if you are using the Norse name). Visualize the energy
          flowing from you solar plexus, through your hand/wand, tracing
          the rune.
              Turn to the East and repeat the invocation. Then to the South
          then to the West. Then Above you, then below you.
               Turn to the North (if not already standing in that direction)
          and say: 
                  Thorn in the North, Hallow and hold this Holy Stead.
               
               Do this for the other five Thorns you have invoked.
           
             
               Having invoked the six points of the circle, we will be invoking


                                                                            1098

          a thorny circle of briar in four parts. Each "string" will be      
          invoked as long as you can say the word Thorn. When your breath runs
          out then one shoud inhale and begin another string, until you have 
          scribed four interlacing, intricate strings of ethric briar. You will
          be tracing these strings so as to create a ball similar to yarn. As
          you are tracing the strings of briar, visualize the briar as being
          covered with sharp, pointy, nasty looking thorns. Invest these 
          thorns with the power to keep out unwanted influences.
           
              O.K. now. Stand facing North. Inhale and as you exhale vibrate
          the word "Thorn" make the vibration of the name last as long as you
          have breath. As you are saing the word trace briar in a circle around
          you. Visualize the stream of briar comming out of the end of your
          wand/finger. Trace the briar in any way you want. I am fond of
          dancing in spirals, spinning in cirlces, moving my hand in the
          way an artist would with a pencil if they were in a globe of
          canvas... When your breath runs out from the first "Thorn", inhale
          and invoke that name again..."TTTTTTHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRNNN
          NNNNNNNNNNNNNNN", drawing a string of briar around the inner surface
          of a globe, forming a globe of briar with your actions. Remember
          to see what is already there and fill in the spaces you have yet
          to get to. When you are out of breath again, inhale, and begin
          the third string of Briar...Don't forget to get the space over your
          head and below your feet. Make wide sweeping motions, small scribbly
          motions. Let your enjoyment of movement arouse more energy, feel the
          energy flowing through you, through your hand, and coming out in the
          stream of briar. When you are out of breath inhale, and invoke the
          Thorn one last time. Make sure to get all of those places that
          have not been covered. Don't worry about small spaces, just make
          sure that there are no large gaps in the ball of briar you have
          just make. Fix the holes with this last invocation.
           
               As you finish this last invocation of Thorn, stand facing North.
          It is not uncommon to feel both exhiliarated and exhausted by this
          process.  Stand,  with feet  apart and  hands  spread over  your head.
          Breath deeply. Visualize the glowing ball of briar...see it, its green
          tendrils intertwining, feel the vibrance of its life force, a force
          that you have given to it. Breath deeply, calming yourself...

              While standing with your feet apart, arms upraised in a "Y"
          inhale, and as you exhale feel your energy flowing through the
          orb of briar, and see, as you energize the orb, the thorns grow. See
          the thorns, browinsh and reddish, getting larger and closing up 
          the small spaces that existed between the strings of briar. Feel 
          the spaces being blocked off. See the blue of the space around you,
          see the orb of thorny briars...Keep the thorns growing until you
          feel that the orb is complete and capable of keeping out any unwanted
          influences. Infuse the orb of briar with the ability to repel unwanted
          energies and permit those energies desired.
           
               Stand in a comfortable position. We are near the end of the
          ritual. The invocation of the God/desses. 
               Stand in the Isa position. Say IIIIIISsssssssss.
               Stand in the As (Anuz) position. Say Odhinn.
               Stand in the Beorch position. Say Urdh.
               Stand in the Ing position. Say Freyr.
               Stand in the Foeh position. Say Freya.
               Stand in the Thorn position. Say Thorr.
           
               Stand in the Isa position. Breath deeply. Thank the God/desses

          silently. Feel the Orb of Thorns surrounding you.   Begin your
          working...secure in your circle.
           
               Certain parts of the ritual were taken from Thorrson's Hammer
          Rite. But the ritual is mostly original. The God/dess names at the
          end can be altered at your behest but try to keep Odhinn First,
          Freya in the middle, and Thorr last. I will be posting meditations
          for the Runic God/desses to help with the last part of this ritual.

                                    SOLITARY MOON RITE 
                            By: Ellen Reed, Coven of Sothistar

          This rite may  be used for either New or Full Moon.  The difference is
          in  your meditation and mental attitude in preparation.  Remember that
          the New Moon  is a time of  outward work and thought,  building to the
          peak which is the Full Moon.  At  the Full Moon, you should be prepar-
          ing to lessen the outward flow of energy, bit by bit, until the period
          before New Mo  on, during which  you are passive,  building a pool  of
          energy within you, in preparation for the New Moon.

          The altar should  be placed in the  center of the ritual area.   On it
          should be placed a rose or stick of incense on the eastern side, a red
          votive candle to the  South; a cup of water on the West, and a bowl of
          salt or living plant on the North.

          Around your ritual  area, you should place an unlighted  candle at the
          cardinal point of each direction.

          To begin your rite,  enter your darkened temple, carrying  one burning
          candle, white or lavender, with you.   Place it on the center of  your
          altar, sit, and meditate  on the meaning of  the rite.  When  you feel
          the time is right, stand,  and go to the eastern point,  carrying with
          you, the burning taper.   Light the votive at the eastern point and go
          to the  southern, picturing, as  you do, an  arc of pure  strong light
          curving from one candle to the next.  Continue to the West, and then
            to the North, lighting the candles as  you go, and then walk to your
          eastern  candle again,  having formed  a circle  of pro  tective light
          surrounding the area in which you worship.

          Return to the  center of the circle, replace the  candle on the altar,
          and say:

          My Lady of  the Moon, who is called Diana,  Artemis, Levanah, Isis and
          by any other names,  I come to you to  bring you my love and  my devo-
          tion.  May you grant me the joy of your presence.

          Mentally divide the room  into four quadrants by visualizing a line of
          silvery moonlight from  the southeast to the northw est,  and from the
          northeast to the southwest.  Go the  East, taking with you the rose or
          incense.  Say:

          Sweet Goddess, the gentle breeze is the touch of your loving hand, the
          wind of storm a reminder of your strength.  The s ound of the trees in
          the wind is your voice, and the fragrance of flowers borne on the wind
          is your gift of beauty.

          Place  the rose  next to the  votive candle,  then stand  there as you
          picture  the  quadrant  filling with  moonlight.    See  the moonlight
          streaming quietly and gently into the room, filling the quadrant
          from center point to the edge of your circle.


          When this is  complete, take the red candle  to the South.   Place the
          gift and see the quadrant fill with moonlight.  Say:


          Most loved  Lady, the light  of the candle is  a guide along  our path
          leading to you; its warmth  the reassurance of your presence  and your
