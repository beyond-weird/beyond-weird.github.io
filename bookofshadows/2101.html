            Text in {} has been changed, moved or editied in some fashion AFTER  
          the ritual was complete.

           Ok, you all will need bread, charcoal, a cauldron/braiser of some
          kind... 
           that you can ignite the charcoal in. 
           
           
           Does everyone know what Lammas is all about? 
           
           Ok, Lammas is a ritual dedicated to the Sun God, or the Corn God 
           Or a variety of other Gods that are known as sacrificial gods 
           called because the ancients believed that the sun at it's highest 
          point (middle of summer) died, and that the essense went into the 
          food to sustain life during the long cold winter ahead. This is the 
          time of the Corn King, as was said, the first of the Harvest times 
           when the first crops were brought in. 
           
           ok, then, we begin...

          * (Visualize a cloud of incense falling across 
            the world, cleansing and purifying, and saying,)

            the Earth rising up and say,) 
           
            "By the Creatures of Water and Earth I cleanse thee." 
           
           
          * (Everyone visualize and connect with the south, 
            the element of Fire.) 
           
            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the South, 
            ye Powers of Fire; Spirits of Illumination and 
            Desire, I do summon, stir, and call you up, to

            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the West,

            Portals, Spirits of Mountain and Plains, I do 
            summon, stir, and call upon you to witness our 
            Rites and to Guard the Circle. 
           
           
            (Connect with the East and the spirit of Air, ) 
           
            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the East, 
            ye Powers of Air; Spirits of Clear Will and 
            Knowledge, I do summon, stir, and call you up,

            a Circle of silver Light.  ) 
           



                                                                            2103

            The Circle is cast, we are between the 
            worlds, beyond the boundaries of time, where 
            Night and Day Birth and Death, Joy and Sorrow, 
            meet as one. 
           
           
          * Listen to the words of the Great Mother, she 
            whom of old was also called among men Artemis, 
            Astarte, Athena, Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, 
            Cerridwen, Dana, Arianrhod, Isis, Brid, and by 
            many other names. 
           
            Whenever you have need of any thing, once in 
            the month, and better it be when the Moon is 
            full, then shall ye assemble in some secret 
            place and adore the spirit of Her, who is 
            Queen of all witches.  There shall ye 
            assemble, ye who are fain to learn all 
            sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets, 
            to these will She teach things that are yet 
            unknown.  And ye shall be free from slavery, 
            and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall 
            be naked in your rites, and ye shall dance, 
            sing, feast, make music and love, all in Her 
            praise.  For Her's is the secret door that 
            opens upon the Land of Youth, and Her's is the 
            cup of the wine of life, and the Cauldron of 
            Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
            Immortality.  She is the Gracious Goddess, who 
            gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man. 
            Upon Earth, She gives knowledge of the spirit 
            eternal, and beyond death, She gives peace, 
            and freedom, and reunion with those who have 
            gone before.  Nor does She demand sacrifice, 
            for behold, She is the Mother of all living, 
            and her Love is poured out upon the Earth. 
            Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess, she in 
            the dust of whose feet are the hosts of 
            Heaven, and whose body encircles the 
            Universe. 
           
            She who is the beauty of the green Earth, and 
            the white Moon among the stars, and the 
            mystery of the waters, and the desire of the 
            hearts of man, calls unto thy soul.  Arise, 
            and come unto Her.  For She is the soul of 
            Nature, who gives life to the universe.  From 
            Her all things proceed, and unto Her all 
            things must return, and before Her face, 
            beloved of Gods and of men, let thine 
            innermost divine self be enfolded in the 
            rapture of the infinite.  Let Her worship be 
            within the heart that rejoiceth, for behold, 
            all act of love and pleasure are Her rituals. 
            And therefore let there be beauty and 



                                                                            2104

            strength, power and compassion, honor and 
            humility, mirth and reverence within you.  And 
            thou who thinkest to seek for Her, know thy 
            seeking and yearning shall avail thee not, 
            unless thou knowest the mystery, that if what 
            thou seekest thou findest not within thee, 
            then thou shalt never find it without thee. 
            For behold, She has been with thee from the 
            beginning, and She is that which is attained 
            at the end of desire. 
           
           
          * (Light charcoal and Take piece of bread in hand.  ) 
           
            now is the time to light your charcoal, and take the bread in hand. 
           
           
            This is the time of Lugh, the Shining One, the 
            Bright One, the Golden One, the Sacrificed 
            One.  He was conceived in the depths of 
            Winter, was Born in the Spring, Danced and 
            Loved in the Summer, and now, He Dies in the 
            Harvest so that we may Live through the long 
            Winter's Night. 
           
           
            Corn King, Sun King, Die and Be Reborn! 
           
            (Feel the death in the bread, the grains that 
            grew under the Sun, feeling the wind and the 
            rain on their husks, the sything of the grain 
            so that the bread may be made, the sacrifice 
            of Life so that Life could live.  ) 
           
            (Feel the Life in the bread, that which has 
            given up life, yet is filled with life, with 
            the sustanence that it provides, contemplate 
            hunger, and then the filling of that need. 
            See enough bread to feed the world., for the 
            God{dess} is not stingy, but looks after all 
            Her Children.  ) 
           
            (Holding the Bread in your hand, offer it up 
            for Blessings.  ) 
           
              "Oh Mighty Mother of us all, bringer of all 
            fruitfulness, give us fruit and grain, flocks 
            and herds, and children to the tribe, that we 
            may mighty.  By the Rose of thy love, do thou 
            descend upon the body of thy children." 
           
            "Behold, the Holly King is dead, he who is 
            also the Corn King.  He has embraced the Great 
            Mother, and died of his love, so has it been, 
            year by year, since time began.  But if the

            Holly King is dead, he who is the God of the 
            Waning Year, all is dead; all that sleeps in 
            Her womb of Earth would sleep forever.  What 
            shall we do therefore, that the Holly King may 
            live again?" 
           
            "We Shall eat of the bread of Life.  Then 
            shall sleep lead on to rebirth." 
           
            (Tear off part of the Bread and offer it to the 
            Flame.  As it ignites and smokes, see the 
            spark of life that will be reborne in the womb 
            of the Earth Mother in the Winter.) 
           
            As the bread smokes, see life and death in the smoke, one lives on
          the 
            other...

            be fruitful." 
           
                 I am the battle-waging spear; 
                 I am a salmon in the pool; 
                 I am a hill of poetry; 
                 I am a ruthless boar; 
                 I am a threatening noise of the sea; 
                 I am a wave of the sea;

          (8-8,SH) Lammas is the time where the fields are ready for
          harvesting, and it is too late to worry if you have done enough
          for the oncoming winter. It is a Corn God, (Lugh) oriented
          festival. It is a celibration and rememberance for the life that
          dies... so that life may live.

          (8-8,SH) We draw the Circle, beginning in the south.
               In your mind's eye, see the Circle of Fire as it stretches
               in an arc from Texas, upward, sweeping curve, to California.
               As the circle passes the West, the Fire becomes Water,
               and a line of liquid blue sweeps upward and across the
               country to the north, far North, into the home of Earth.
               The Circle of liquid Blue now becomes dark, dark as the
               fertile earth, and the arc proceeds to the East, to the home
               of Air, where the Circle becomes yellow.
               The Arc continues on to the South, to the home of Fire, and
               the Circle is Cast, We are in the place Between the Worlds,
               outside the Space of Time, where Life and Death have no
               meaning. We have come home.

          (8-8,SH) Shadowstar, from the South, will you please invoke the
               Watchtower of the South, as is your right?
               Ladyhawk, from the West, will you invoke the Watchtower of
               the West...
               when Shadowstar is finished?

               Earth; the bones of the continents beneath our feet...
               Hail and welcome

               spirit of Air, which nourishes all that lives....
               come now to our circle; cleanse us and help us to travel...
               freely in your world, aided by your force. Blessed be!

          (8-8,SH) Blessed Be!

          (8-8,SH) Hail Lady, Bright Mother, Dark Mother...
               We call to you, from your home in the Stars,
               From your home beneath our feet, your children call to you.
               Come, be with us, guide us tonight in your Rites.
               Hail Sun God, Hail Corn God, we call you you.
               From your Fiery Chariot, we bid you come...
               From the Fertile Fields, we bid you come...
               Be with us, guide us, in your Rite tonight.

               Now is the time of the death of the Sun God,
               as we walk into the dark of night.
               Breath deep of the light of the Golden One,
               Lugh, the Sun King, for the long nights are coming.
               Now is the time of the death of the Corn King,
               who dies as the fields are reaped.
               We stand in the time of waiting,
               for the fall of winter is upon us,
               and the ground shall lie lifeless
               under the hand of the Reaper.
               Look at the fields of your life.
               Have you sown well?
               Have you tended your fields with care?
               What do you fear?

          (8-8,SH) Now, take your candle, and light it.
               Now, take a piece of bread in your hand,
               a small piece, and hold it



                                                                            2109

               think about your fears that haunt you in the night...
               focus them into the bread,
               and chant the name of your fear into
               the piece of bread.
               when you have focused your fear into the bread,
               hold the charged bread to the flame,
               and chant your fear BEGONE!
               As the bread smokes and blackens, your fears are burned away
               all fears are burned away
               Take these fears and feed them to the Fire,
               free yourself from fear.
               Give your fears to the fire, and let them go,
               you do not need them.

          (8-8,SH) In this fire, may it pass from me,
               May it pass, May it pass,
               May it pass on the outflowing tide
               And burn with the red sun
               As the year dies
               And fade
               As everything fades,
               As everything passes,
               All fades away,
               As everything passes,
               All fades away.
               What do you hope to harvest?
               Think about your Harvest, what will you reap?

          (8-8,SH) take the rest of the bread, and hold it in your hand,
               Chant what you desire, what is your harvest,
               what are your hopes?

          (8-8,SH) In this night hope manifests
               May it come, may it come,
               May it come on rising tide,
               And grow by the red sun
               As the year dies
               And light fades
               As hope rises
               As hope soars
               As hope remains
               As hope soars
               As hope remains
               Hope is a Star, burning bright in the night

          (8-8,SH) Feel the hope   
               charge the bread of Life
               tear the bread in half

          (8-8,SH) Behold the Corn King, eat of the Bread of Life,
               that dies to be reborn. Eat of the Bread of Life,
               that you might live through the long winter's Night.
               For it is written that Life must die so that Life can live.
               All is in the hands of the Mother,
               from Birth, until Death, and to Birth again.



                                                                            2110

               Farewell Golden One, Fairwell Corn King, Fairwell Sun King.
               You will be reborn through the Mother, Creatrix and
               Destructress. We shall await your return.
               Corn King, Life King, Death King,
               your death will bring us life.

          (8-8,SH) Hail Corn King Golden One,
               Waving Gently in the Sun,
               Brought to rest by scythe's sharp kiss
               Sleep in Her arms.

          (8-8,SH) Take of the Bread of Life, the Corn King, and eat,
               that you may live through the long nights ahead.
               Eat the Bread of Life, and remember,
               life dies so that Life lives.
               the bread that is left, offer to Her,
               so that Her creatures may live
               though the long nights ahead too.
               later tonight, place the bread outside
               with a prayer and your thanks
               for the gift of Life.
               Breath deep, feel the Life within
               Feel the veins throb with life
               Feel the bread of Life recharging your life force.
               Meditate on this,
               that Life comes from Death, and Death from Life.
               The cycle goes around, and we are a part of it,
               as surely as the Corn King himself.

               Farewell Lady, Farewell Lord, and Thank you.
               Blessed Be

          (8-8,SH) Now see the Circle around us sinking down,
               down into the Earth...
               Carrying Life itself into the ground,
               fertilizing and charging the Earth for the coming night.
               Gradually, the Circle disappears from sight,
               slowly dissolving, starting in the East,
               moving back, retracing it's path to the north,
               and from there to the west.
               From the west back to the South, ending
               at the beginning.
               And we are returned to this world.
               The Circle is open, but never broken

          (8-8,SH) Merry Meet, and Merry Part
                And Merry Meet again!

               the Fires of the Forge; 
               the Fires of Inspiration.   
               We call upon Brighid, patron Goddess of  
               the waters that give life 
               Giving life, transforming seeds  
               buried deep below the frost  
               into the amazing gift of Growth and Possibility and

               (Here, any and all are welcome to mention their own 
               personal invocations) <ga> 
           
          (8-13,Babs) Hail Lady of the Forge. 
           
          (8-22,Lynne) I call white and golden light to the Earth for her
               healing 
               I ask Bridget to send a blessing onto the Earth 
           
          (8-13,Babs) Make it so. 
           
          (8-18,Tapestry) Hold a seed in your hand.  Project yourself 
               beyond the hard seed covering. 
               To the soft kernel inside. 
               At one end of the kernel is a tiny, sharp point. 
               The kernel can split in half and the sharp point 
               becomes a tiny germinal plant. 
               Imagine the seed planted in the soft soil of the garden. 
               The snow covering the ground insulates the seed from 
               the cold winter winds as it sleeps. 
               The tiny germ feels the gentle warming of the sun and 
               the moisture of the melting snow as it slowly wakens. 
               This wakening of the tiny, hidden embryo of the plant is 
               Imbolc - the first stirrings of Spring.  The time when 
               the tiny seedling thrusts roots into the soil, and prepares 
               leaves to capture the sun's future nourishment and warmth. 
               When the ground is soft, the snow gone, and the sun smiling 
               upon the land it will be ready. 
               Imbolc is the time when the pregnant mares develop bulging 
               udders for their foals, and about two weeks before they  
               deliver, the oozing colostrum dries into a waxy covering 
               on the teats.  When this happens, the farmer knows that  
               her time is near.  Spring will arrive soon, and both  
               the mare and the farmer will be ready. 
               This is Imb-olc.  The name comes from the "Oim" (ewe's) -  
               "olc" (milk).  The ewe's udder, like the mare's, 
               swells and prepares for the birth of twin lambs - usually 
               in late February or early March.  This sign was very  
               important for herdsmen in the north because ewes  
               usually look for a secluded place to give birth, and  
               if her time was near with a bitter cold snap or late  
               winter storm brewing, the results could be disastrous. 
               This is also a day one-third through the Celtic Lunar 



                                                                            2114

               Month of Luis; the Rowan tree.  The celebration of  
               Brighid's (Breed) Day, or Candlemas, one of the 4 Great 
               Fire Festivals of the Celtic Year.  The others are: 
               Beltane, Lammas, and Samhain.  For each, a balefire,  
               bonefire, or candle was lit to mark the spiritual  
               beginning of the season.  It was seen as the rebirth  
               of spirit, the spiralling out again from darkness. 
               Let us go to sleep tonight thinking about these new 
               beginnings.  These new births, and the beginning of 
               our new selves.  To concentrate on our own beginnings  
               within the womb of the Mother.  How we begin anew with  
               the understanding, compassion, and love conceived within 
               her fertility. 
               Let us concentrate on maintaining a groundedness within 
               Her.  Concentrate on learning to focus ourselves to the 
               tasks at hand and complete them with the calmness of 
               knowing that She guides our every move and thought. 
               In so doing, we will become more caring and competent, 
               loving and assured. 
           
          (8-8,Jehana) (Pause to reflect and meditate on this) 
               Thank you, Brighid.  
               We accept Your gifts and Your blessings. 
               Hail and Farewell !

               the slumbering seed, the pregnant ewe, the forsythia buds. 
               For your promise of Summer's heat, 
               for the urgency of love's passion, 
               we thank you!

               Guardians of the West, we thank you. 
               The melting ice, dripping from the eaves. 
               The spring rain that drapes us with love. 
               For the healing sound of water burbling from a spring, 
               we thank you! 
               Hail and Farewell! 
               Guardians of the North, we thank you. 
               For the rocks beneath the winter snow. 
               For the roots of trees seeking earth's warmth downward; 
               the swell of the hills, the thrust of the great mountains, 
               The tracks of the wolf in the new-fallen snow. 
               we thank you! 
               Hail and Farewell!

          (1-2,Diana) Listen to me, Oh my Children, and walk with me in the
          (1-2,Diana) Woods.
          (1-2,Diana) Around you I weave my spell and might.  The trees grow
          (1-2,Diana) thicker and strong.  Off in the distance you hear the
          (1-2,Diana) sound of a large animal crashing through the brush, and
          (1-2,Diana) close you hear the chirping of birds.  The gentle hum
          (1-2,Diana) of sacred bees about their labor of collecting pollen
          (1-2,Diana) for Me, for I am their Queen too.
          (1-2,Diana) The Wind swirls around us, and the scent of life fills
          (1-2,Diana) the air.  Tangy pine, sharp ceder, far off apple trees
          (1-2,Diana) all cast their call upon the air.
          (1-2,Diana) The sound in the brush gets closer and closer, till a
          (1-2,Diana) great Stag bursts forth from the brush.  Head thrown
          (1-2,Diana) back he bellows his cry.  Then with a twist he is off,
          (1-2,Diana) quicker than the thunder rolling down from the hills,
          (1-2,Diana) he speeds.  But, I am faster.
          (1-2,Diana) Bow twangs, arrow flies, and with the muted sound of an
          (1-2,Diana) earthquake, he dies.
          (1-2,Diana) Look at me, my Children.  I am the Goddess of
          (1-2,Diana) Swiftness, with a look I can bring death.  And bending
          (1-2,Diana) down, I touch the Stag, and with a start he bounds



                                                                            2118

          (1-2,Diana) can bring life.  I am Life Eternal, and I am Death

          (1-2,Dionysus) Kiss of Life and Death.  And I love her.

          (1-2,Dionysus) Doorway betwixt Life and Death is Mine.

          (1-2,Dionysus) that Her Blessings will grow with you through the year.

          (1-5,Jehana) I am the Lady of the starry heavens
               I am she who is the Mother of all living things
               I have worked the landscape into mountains
               lay the waters into their ocean beds,
               and set the winds in their course.
               Every snowflake, every speck of soil or sand
               Bears my imprint.
               My countenance appears in the faintest flicker,
               and the largest star;
               The Universe is My handiwork.
               I am She who consoles the sorrowful,
               and I am She who tends to the sick.
               I bring solace to those in life,
               and peace and understanding in death.
               I am the changing Goddess --
               Maiden, Mother, and Crone --
               The Hag hidden deep within...
               I have been to the Underworld,
               and I have Returned.
               Let there be beauty and strength,
               Power and compassion,
               Honor and humility,
               Mirth and reverence within you.
               And you who seek to know Me,
               To feel My spirit
               Come before Me with a sincere heart,
               burn incense upon my altar
               Listen and be still:
               Know that your seeking and your yearning 
               will avail you not,
               Unless you know the Mystery:
               For if that which you seek, 



                                                                            2125

               you find not within yourself,
               You will never find it without.
               For Behold:  
               I have been with you from the beginning,
               and I am that which is attained at the end of          
               desire.

          (1-8,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be!

          (1-8,Shadow Hawk) By the Flame that burneth bright O' Horned One!
               We call thy name into the night, O' Ancient One!
               Thee we invoke, by the moon-lit sea, 
               by the standing stone and the twisted tree.
               Thee we invoke, where gather thine own, 
               by the nameless shrine forgotten and alone.
               Come where the round of the dance is Trod.
               Horn and Hoof of the Goatfoot God!
               By moon-lit meadows on dusky hill, 
               when the haunted wood is hushed and still.
               Come to the charm of the chanted prayer.
               As the moon bewitches the midnight air, 
               evoke thy powers, that potent bide.
               In shining stream and the secret tide, 
               in fiery flame by starlight pale, 
               in Shadowy host that rides the gale, 
               and by the fern-brakes fairy-haunted 
               of forest wild and woods enchanted.
               Come!  O' Come!
               To the heart-beat's drum!
               When the broad white moon is climbing slow.
               Through the stars to the heaven's height.
               We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night!
               As black tree-branches shake and sigh,
               By Joy and terror we know thee nigh,
               We speak the spell thy power unlocks,
               At Solstice, Sabbat, and Equinox.
               Word of Virtue the veil to rend,
               From Primal Dawn to the wide World's end,
               Since time began, the blessings of Pan
               Blessed be in strength and love,
               Blessed be, wher'ere we rove,
               Vision fade not from our eyes
               Of the Pagan Paradise.
               Past the gates of Death and Birth,
               Our inheritance of Earth.
               From our soul the song of Spring
               Fade not in our wandering, Our life is one, 
               By blackest night or the noonday Sun. 
               Eldest of Gods on thee we call, 
               Blessing be on thy Creatures all.
               I call upon thee, O' Ancient Horned One Who art the
               Comforter and the Consoler of Men I call upon thee, O' Great
               God of the Witches.

               Invoke into your heard and into this our Circle

               Growing strong.
               A child at heart, learning, searching, in true Discovery.
               Hail, bright Lord; we welcome thee!!
               According to Sun Bear, this Moon is the Moon of Rest and
               Cleansing, following upon the Moon of Earth Renewal. The
               animal is the Otter, and the plant, the Quaking Aspen. 
               Its  mineral is silver.  
               In the Celtic tree calendar, as reported by Graves, this
               full Moon falls in the month of Luis, signified by the Rowan
               tree, and by the Tourmaline.  Its attribute is Quickening.  
               Those who follow astrology know this is the month of
               Aquarius, the Water Bearer; the fixed sign of Air. 
               According to Z Budapest, the Full Moon aspect of February is
               the red and cleansing wild Moon.  Life quickens now.  It is



                                                                            2130

               a time of purification, of growth, of the stimulation of all
               living things.  
               It is a healing time.  It brings in the wind of the New. 
               Its flower:  the primose and the violet.  Its animal: the
               duck and the otter.  Its stone:  the amethyst.  
               It is appropriate at this time to do workings; workings for 
               things we may wish to see in our lives, and in the world in 
               general.  It is a time for healing.  It is a time for
               growth.   
               I ask each of you to think of those things you wish to work
               on,-- you may speak or keep them silent, as you will...
               Speak first of new beginnings and things of growth for the
               world at large.  Then, speak of those new beginnings and
               things of growth and healing for people or events closer to
               home.  And, yes, speak of those beginnings and things of
               growth for you yourself.  After we finish mentioning all of
               our workings, we will repeat a phrase -- visualize the
               energy, through the hand of the Goddess, flowing into the
               things we seek, imbuing them with constructive energy. 
               (Please note that most Witches consider it unethical to work
               healings or other magic for specific people without first
               asking their permission).  
               (When I start doing the chant (which begins with "We all
               come from the Goddess"), others may copy me, or jump ahead
               if they are familiar with it...
               I will tell you when to visualize the energy peaking.)
               -- mention things in your mind or in print that you wish to
               allow to grow/heal:
          (Rilla) I wish for a healing ...
               of the youth of this country...
               that they may find the peace that they need...

               and to be the "future" of this world...
               and for myself the patience...
               to wait for direction...
               in my life path...
               and a healthy mind and body..

          (Jehana) I wish for the earth's healing...
               the pain in the environment to be turned around...
               an understanding of the nature of this planet upon which we
               live.
               I wish to know and be known by love and compassion.
          (Ardelia) I wish for this world.....
               the ability to be calm...
               as we learn to work with each other.....
               the earth.....
               and ourselves.
          (Jehana) We all come from the Goddess
               And to her we shall return

               Consort, the Horned God.
               Hail to the God as one, Consort, Father, Son.  I bid thee
               come to the Circle of Life, and worship at the feet of Our

               we are here...
               Hail to Our Lady, in whose eyes the stars do shine forth and
               upon whose brow the Moon doth ride.  Lady, your children
               call to you from within your Sacred Space.  We bid you come
               and let us Feel your touch.  You who will deny your children
               naught.  We are at your feet in Wonder and Awe.  Welcome to

          (1-4,Cernunnos) We are in the Place between the Worlds, Beyond
               Time and Space, and in the presence of the Goddesses and
               Gods.  Let none leave this space without grave cause.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos) Welcome the Divine Lady, Gracious Goddess and
               Mother of us all.
               I call upon thee, Mighty Mother of us all, bringer of all
               fruitfulness; by seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and
               flower and fruit, by life and love do I invoke thee to
               descend upon the body of this thy Circle and thy
               Priestesses.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos)   Hail Aradia!  From the Almathean horn Pour
               forth thy store of love; I lowly bend before thee, I adore
               thee to the end, with loving sacrifice thy shrine adorn. 
               Thy foot is to my lip, my prayer upborne upon the rising
               incense smoke; then spend thine ancient love, O Mighty One,
               descend to Aid me, who without thee am forlorn.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos)   Thou art the Mother Darksome and Divine, Yours
               the scourge and yours the Kiss, the Five-point star of love
               and bliss, bless us with your sign.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos) Listen to the words of the Great Mother, she whom
               of old was also called among men Artemis, Astarte, Athena,
               Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Dana, Arianrhod,
               Isis, Brid, and by many other names.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos)  "Whenever you have need of any thing, once in
               the month, and better it be when the Moon is full, then
               shall ye assemble in some secret place and adore the spirit
               of Her, who is Queen of all witches.
               There shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn all
               sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets, to these will
               She teach things that are yet unknown.  And ye shall be free
               from slavery, and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall
               be naked in your rites, and ye shall dance, sing, feast,
               make music and love, all in Her praise.  For Hers is the
               secret door that opens upon the Land of Youth, and Hers is
               the cup of the wine of life, and the Cauldron of Cerridwen,
               which is the Holy Grail of Immortality.  She is the Gracious
               Goddess, who gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man. 
               Upon Earth, She gives knowledge of the spirit eternal, and
               beyond death, She gives peace, and freedom, and reunion with
               those who have gone before.  Nor does She demand sacrifice,
               for behold, She is the Mother of all living, and her Love is
               poured out upon the Earth."
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos)  Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess, she in
          the dust of whose feet are the hosts of Heaven, and whose body
          encircles the Universe.
           
          (1-4,Cernunnos)  "She who is the beauty of the green Earth, and
               the white Moon among the stars, and the mystery of the

               waters, and the desire of the hearts of man, calls unto thy
               soul.  Arise, and come unto Her.
               For She is the soul of Nature, who gives life to the
               universe.  From Her all things proceed, and unto Her all
               things must return, and before Her face, beloved of Gods and
               of men, let thine innermost divine self be enfolded in the
               rapture of the infinite.  Let Her worship be within the
               heart that rejoiceth, for behold, all acts of love and
               pleasure are Her rituals.  And therefore let there be beauty
               and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility,
               mirth and reverence within you.  And thou who thinkest to
               seek for Her, know thy seeking and yearning shall avail thee
               not, unless thou knowest the mystery, that if what thou
               seekest thou findest not within thee, then thou shalt never
               find it without thee.  For behold, She has been with thee
               from the beginning, and She is that which is attained at the
               end of desire."
               Absorb Her Blessings and her words.  Feel them resonate in
               your core.

          (1-4,S.H.)   If there are any here that have a petition to bring
               before the Lady, please do so now.
               If there are any objects to be charged, please bring them
               forth now.
           
          <At this point, petitions and objects were presented to the Lady
          and the Circle for blessings--this section is deleted due to
          mention of names of non-participants>
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Now is the time for the Great Rite.  Please take your
               knife in one hand...and your chalice in the other.
               Place the tip of the knife in the chalice and say,
                 "As the chalice is to the Woman
                 So the Athame is to the Man
                 And when the two become one,
                 The greatest magic is begun!"
               Now dip your atheme into the chalice to energize the
               lifeforce within it.
               Blessed Be, So mote it be!
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Now, take the Atheme (knife) over the bread/cake..
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Lady, we come before you with love in our heart and
               awe in our eyes, asking you to give us your blessings and
               pour your blessings on the fruit of the vine and the field,
               that we may be filled with your blessings.
               So mote it be, Blessed be!
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Draw a pentagram on the bread with the knife.
               Now, eat of the bread and drink of the wine, saving some
               portion for offering to the creatures of the Lady later.
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Now it's time to bid farewell to the Lady and the
               Lord.

          (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the South
               Hail Lord of the South, Lord of Fire, we thank you for your
               presence and the Light and warmth that you shed upon us. 
               Farewell and Blessed Be.

               presence and the Air that you bring to us that life may be
               sustained.  Farewell and Blessed Be.

               Hail Lord of the North, Lord of Earth, we thank you for your
               presence and the harvest from your fields that feed and
               shelter us.  Farewell and Blessed Be.
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Now we turn our attention to the West....
               Hail Lord of the West, Lord of Water, we thank you for your
               presence and the blood of your body to slake our thirst and
               the thirst of the fields.  Farewell and Blessed Be.
           
          (1-3,S.H.) Now I send my Will to the North, and I walk the
               circle...
               Circle of Fire, I quench your thirst...
               Down down into the ground...

               Spread your life throughout the land...

          (1-3,S.H.) My Lady Otterkin, wilt thou begin the Lady's Rite?

          (1-4,Otterkin) This is the time of fullness,
               the flood tide of power,
               when the Lady in full circle of brightness
               rides across the night sky.
               This is the time of the bearing of fruits,
               of changes realized.
               The Great Mother,
               Nurturer of the world which is Herself,
               pours out her love and her gifts in Abundance.
               The Hunter draws near to the Brilliant One,
               She who awakens yearning in the heart
               and is the end of desire.

               Merry Meet.

               call unto thy soul.
               Arise, and come unto me.
               For I am the soul of Nature,
               who gives life to the universe.
               From me all things proceed,
               and unto me all things must return,
               and before my face,
               beloved of Gods and of men.
               Let thine innermost divine self be enfolded
               in the rapture of the infinite.
               Let my worship be within the heart that rejoiceth.

               For behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.
               And therefore let there be beauty and strength,
               power and compassion, honour and humility,
               mirth and reverence within you.
               And thou who thinkest to seek for me,
               know thy seeking and yearning
               shall avail thee not, unless thou knowest the mystery,
               that if that which thou seekest
               thou findest not within thee,
               then thou shalt never find it without thee.
               For behold, I have been with thee from the beginning,
               and I am that which is attained at the end of desire."

          (1-3,S.H.) (Take this time to meditate on the Fullness of the
               Mother...
               And also on what is said in the Charge we have just been
               given, for truely...
               You will never find it without thee, but only within thee.)

          (1-3,S.H.) Now we come to the time of power, for the Moon is Full
               and we are gathered
               here in Her Circle, so we shall raise the Cone of Power...
               Visualize a fire in the night and we are together
               around the fire.  The Drums begin a rhythm, subtle but
               insistant. You begin to sway and move with the full
               sensual beat, dancing as only spirit can.  Around and
               around the fire you go while the drumming grows faster
               and louder.  You can FEEL the energies gathering, until
               your hair is flying wild, and your skin crawls with an
               energy like electricity.  You are alive with power!
               Join hands and chant with us:
                    "Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!
                    Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!
               now SHOUT!
                    Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!"

          (1-4,Otterkin) I take this energy and with it I consecrate this
               Ritual Space, that it shall always be a safe haven for
               Her Children!  I take this energy and offer it to those that
               need healing.
               Those that have need, take from it, for I AM She that
               gives Life and Bounty, I AM the Mother of All!
               I take this energy, and I return it to the
               Universe, that there will be fruitfulness throughout
               the Worlds and all my Children shall benefit."

          (1-6,Otterkin) (Place your knife in front of you and take your
               chalice in hand)
               As I raise the chalice, you do likewise.
               I raise this chalice, symbol of my Eternal Womb,
               source of All That was and All That will be.
               (Take your knife, and hold it over the chalice, point down)

          (1-3,S.H.) I take this Athame, symbol of my Quickening essense,
               Life Fire that lights the Chalice within, and with it
               I Quicken thy fertile womb, O Mother of us all.

          (1-6,Otterkin) As the Chalice is to the Goddess, Awaiting the
               Spark

          (1-3,S.H.) And the Athame is to the God, so I enter into your
               hidden Dark.

          (1-6,Otterkin) And when Two becomes one
               (Dip the tip into the chalice)

          (1-3,S.H.) The Greatest magic is begun!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Drink from my depths and meditate on them, oh ye
               who would know of the full Circle of Birth and Death.
               (Accept our kiss, and taste the wine, saving a
               small portion for offering later.)
               I take these cakes, fruit of my fields, and I
               Bless them and give them to you.  
               Eat, that you may never hunger and think upon my Bounty.
               (Kiss, and eat the cake, saving a small portion
               for offering later.)
               I charge you to remember that some part of this bounty be
               returned to the Earth, that the cycle will continue.
               When you return to the World, give of the Bread
               and Water of Life to my Earth.

               Be your Name.

               to hold us safe throughout the day, that we may

               the wiring) into the ground, and Out to the boundaries
               of the Universe.
               The Circle is Open, but never broken.  Merry meet,

          Compuserve on-line Full Moon Mar. '93

          (Shadow Hawk) Ok, we begin....
          (Shadow Hawk) see the darkness of the night settling in around you....
          (Shadow Hawk) and gradually as your eyes adjust you find yourself in
          (Shadow Hawk) the woods, and the sound of the night creatures begin to
          (Shadow Hawk) be heard.
          (Shadow Hawk) Ahead you see the glow of a fire deep in the woods.  it
          is
          (Shadow Hawk) a small fire, that you might easily miss, but it pulls
          you
          (Shadow Hawk) to it like a compass to the magnet.
          (Shadow Hawk) As you enter a small clearing, you see around you
          shadowy figures
          (Shadow Hawk) robed and moving in the flickering candle light.  You
          feel the
          (Shadow Hawk) powers of the night begin to stir.
          (Shadow Hawk) On the horizon, you see the full moon breaking in
          through the trees...
          (Shadow Hawk) and you hear the sounds of a small bell.  You stand
          within the circle..
          (Shadow Hawk) and one figure breaks away and begins to call to the
          four directions...
          (Marc Tripp) Walking to the East of the cirlce and raising my athame.
          (Marc Tripp) I summon the Guardian of the Gate of Air!
          (Marc Tripp) King of the Poweres of the East
          (Marc Tripp) The Sacred Space is thine for this Night!
          (Marc Tripp) Open for me the Way-Without-Time.
          (Marc Tripp) Air of Earth, We are One with Thee!
          (Marc Tripp) Then turning and walking to the south of the circle
          (Marc Tripp) I raise my Athame.
          (Marc Tripp) I summon the Guardian of the Gate of Earth!
          (Marc Tripp) King of the Powers of the South!
          (Marc Tripp) The Sacred Space is thine for this Night!
          (Marc Tripp) Open for us the Way-Without-Time
          (Marc Tripp) Earth of Earth, We are one with thee!
          (Marc Tripp) Walking to the West..I raise my athame.
          (Marc Tripp) I Summon the Guardian of the Gate of Water!
          (Marc Tripp) King of the Powers of the West!
          (Marc Tripp) The Sacred space is thine for this Night!
          (Marc Tripp) Open for us the Way-Without-Time.
          (Marc Tripp) Water of Earch, We are One with Thee!
          (Marc Tripp) Walking to the North.  I raise my athame.
          (Marc Tripp) I Summon the Guardian of the Gate of fire!
          (Marc Tripp) King of the Powers of the North!
          (Marc Tripp) The Sacred Space is thine for this Night!
          (Marc Tripp) Open For me the Way-Without-Time.
          (Marc Tripp) Fire of Earth, I we are One with Thee!
          (Marc Tripp) I then return to my place in the circle.
          (Shadow Hawk) Two figures break forth and gather the earth/water and
          fire/air
          (Shadow Hawk) from the altar where they rest....
          (Shadow Hawk) I cleanse and purify this place with the spirits of
          Earth and Water...



                                                                            2143

          (Shadow Hawk) I cleanse and purify this place with the creatures of
          Air and Fire!
          (Shadow Hawk) I take the Sword of Knowledge and walking to the North,
          I point
          (Shadow Hawk) it down do the ground.  Cascading rivers of fire flow
          from it
          (Shadow Hawk) and I walk the circle in a clockwise fashion...
          (Shadow Hawk) and as I walk a curtain of fire flairs up behind me,
          around the
          (Shadow Hawk) circle I walk.
          (Shadow Hawk) The Circle is cast, we are in the space between the
          worlds
          (Shadow Hawk) in a place that is not a place, in a time that is not a
          time,
          (Shadow Hawk) in a space that is not a space.  We are in the Sacred
          Circle.
          (Shadow Hawk) So Mote it be!
          (Shadow Hawk) Two figures walk to the altar, and the power surrounds
          them.
          (Shadow Hawk) with wure hands they take up the tools of Power, and
          begin to speak...
          (Priestess) This is the time of the fulness of the symbol of our Lady
          ,
          (Priestess) the Moon. All things wax and wane, and on this evening the
          (Priestess) powers of life, of magic, and of creation are at their
          (Priestess) highest. This is the time of building, of doing. it is a
          (Priestess) time when the veil between the mundane world and the
          strange
          (Priestess) and beautiful realms of elfhame becomes thin indeed.  On
          (Priestess) this night may one transcend the boundaries of the worlds
          (Priestess) with ease, and know beauty and enchantment.
          (Priest) There is a magnificence to this time. The ancients knew well
          (Priest) of the mysteries of this night, and used them well to build
          (Priest) and to strengthen themselves.. and to partake of elvish
          (Priest) adventures of which we can have but little inkling.
          (Priest) Sensuous , mysterious, magical...beauty in human form, in
          (Priest) dramatic costume, in solid, soaring architecture, the lithe
          (Priest) suppleness of our animal brethren, the arrogant magnificence
          (Priest) of a spectacular landscape. And more.....much more.
          (Priest) This is a time for weaving of the inchoate into being, of
          (Priest) spinning the strands of space and of time to bring forth
          (Priest) Creation. For all does rotate, and turn about upon itself;
          (Priest) this is a fundamental principle of the universe, and a
          (Priest) mystery of the greatest magnitude. The Gods know of it and
          (Priest) we shall also. Weave a spell of Moonlight and fashion with
          (Priest) it a fabric of pure magical substance.
          (Priest) There is a challenge and a joy to building, and creating.
          (Priest) The joyous strife of a just battle, of the cascading passion
          (Priest) of lovemaking, and even to the birth-pangs in creating a new
          (Priest) life. there is the peace of Aphrodite that follows such as
          (Priest) these, a thoroughly fulfilling quietude.  And it is easy,
          (Priest) really. very easy and the most natural of things.
          (Priestess) This is a time of travelling unseen in the full moonlight,
          a



                                                                            2144

          (Priestess) time for hearing of elfin music not made by humankind. It
          is
          (Priestess) a time for oneness with the forest, with the mountains,
          with
          (Priestess) the eternal and life-giving sea, with the warm rains and
          the
          (Priestess) bolt of lightning that creates the very spark of life.  It
          (Priestess) is a time for pilgrimage to the holy of holies, to stand
          at
          (Priestess) last before the cauldron of our Lady and to see form, and
          (Priestess) substance, and being created anew once more.
          (Priestess) Hear the sound of the Circle Bell...
          (Priestess) (Repeat after Priestess)
          (Priestess) All hail, O goddess of the silver-rimmed cauldron.
          (Rilla) All hail, o goddess of the silver-rimmed cauldron.
          (Marc Tripp) All hail, O goddess of the silver-rimmed cauldron.
          (Jim Stay) All hail O Goddess of the silver-rimmed cauldron
          (Priestess) All hail, thou from whom all does come.
          (Kammy) all hail, o goddess of the silver-rimmed cauldron.
          (Many Blue Sparks) All hail, o goddess of the silver rimmed cauldron
          (Rilla) All hail, thou from whom all does come.
          (Kammy) all hail, thou from whom all does come.
          (Jim Stay) All Hail thou from whom all does come
          (Marc Tripp) All Hail, Thou from whom all does come.
          (Priestess) On this night do we give salutation to the magic of
          creation
          (Priestess) And to the ecstasy of the Gods.
          (Many Blue Sparks) All hail, thou from whom all does come.
          (Kammy) on this night doe we give salutation to the magic of creation
          (I.D.) All hail thou from whom all do3s come
          (Kammy) and to the ecstasy of the Gods.
          (Rilla) On this night do we give salutation to the magic of creation
          (Marc Tripp) On this night do we give salutation to the magic of
          creation and to the 
          (Marc Tripp) ecstasy of the Gods
          (Rilla) and to the ecstasy of the Gods!
          (Priestess) (Smell the rising incense smoke and hear the circle bell)
          (Many Blue Sparks) On this night doe we give salutation to the magick
          of creation
          (Many Blue Sparks) and to the ecstasy of the Gods.
          (Priestess) O gracious and beautiful goddess, Teach us to weave magic,
          (Priestess) Show us thy ancient art to bring forth from chaos and from
          (Priestess) nothingness that which is Being itself teach us to draw
          from
          (Priestess) the Moon, to spin and to fashion fabric magical and pure;
          (Priestess) Insubstantial as dew, yet  with the strength of iron.
          (Priest) O most excellent Lady, teach us of love, and of beauty, and
          (Priest) of sensuousness.
          (Priest) Teach us of daring, and of adventure. Show us of the
          (Priest) building of spells of the spinning and shaping of moonlight.
          (Priest) Lead our feet in the magical dances of power. Show to us the
          (Priest) paths between the worlds, To realms strange, and beautiful.
          (Priest) Lead us through mist and moonlight to places of crystalline

          (Priest) (hear the sounds of the bell)
          (Priestess) Teach us, O Lady of radiance To speak the language of the
          (Priestess) wilds, To fly with the freedom of the bird, To live with
          the
          (Priestess) power and grace of the feline, To know the ease, the
          (Priestess) beautiful ease of creating.  And to know ecstasy and joy.
          To
          (Priestess) stir t he very heights of our being.
          (Priestess) BLESSED BE !
          (Priestess) Prepare for Meditation.
          (Priestess) We are all seated comfortably on cushions near a large
          (Priestess) mirror.  It is night, and the moon is full. We stand up
          (Priestess) where we are, and stepping out of our bodies, leave them
          (Priestess) resting comfortably behind. We go to the mirror and look
          (Priestess) through; we can see through to the other side and make out
          a
          (Priestess) moonlit grassy hill beyond, rising before us, We step
          (Priestess) through and fins ourselves in a warm moonlit night. a path
          (Priestess) stretches off to the right across a broad grassy meadow.
          We
          (Priestess) look back briefly and see the portal of our mirror, with
          the
          (Priestess) candle lights on the other side; it will be here open and
          (Priestess) waiting for us on our return.  We start up the path in the
          (Priestess) bright, full moonlight...
          (Priestess) In the distance ahead of us we see forest covered hills,
          the
          (Priestess) sky is bright with many stars. the wind moans softly in
          the
          (Priestess) tall grasses, there is the smell of pine on the air, on
          (Priestess) either side the mist lies low upon the ground, we continue
          (Priestess) across the meadow turning until the forest lies off to one
          (Priestess) side, ahead of us now we see scattered fruit trees,
          through
          (Priestess) which we walk. the grass underfoot is wet with dew, our
          (Priestess) robes drift in the gentle breeze, the ground begins to
          rise
          (Priestess) before us and the air is full of the sounds of night birds
          (Priestess) and crickets. we move tirelessly up the slight incline,
          (Priestess) seeming to barely touch the ground, fireflies flicker
          (Priestess) briefly in the distance as we move through the shadows
          (Priestess) beneath the trees, our movements almost soundless, patches
          (Priestess) of moonlight cast our shadows, rainbow rimmed on the wet
          (Priestess) grass.
          (Priestess) We glance back and, far behind we can see the rolling
          hills
          (Priestess) and on the horizon, what seem to be the flickering of a
          (Priestess) distant thunderstorm, the clouds far away, above us the
          sky
          (Priestess) is clear, the moonlight bright.  Mist drifts in patches
          over
          (Priestess) the meadow, w e pass on through it. there is the heady
          (Priestess) perfume of flowers, the smell of grass and trees, small
          (Priestess) animals rustle near us. we move quickly and silently on,
          (Priestess) passing through the trees like moonbeams, haloes about our



                                                                            2146

          (Priestess) shadows. almost as if there were others with us.. but we
          (Priestess) cannot make them out. The forest closes in as we progress,
          (Priestess) ahead we make out the what seems to be the entrance to a
          (Priestess) cave, with a soft multicoloured glow within.
          (Priestess) As we approach we see what appear to be glistening miner-
          als
          (Priestess) encrusting the rock about the entrance to the cave.  We
          hear
          (Priestess) sounds of soft music from within, rainbow colours flash
          (Priestess) colouring the wisps of mist which drift before it. We step
          (Priestess) inside...
          (Priestess) We seem to be wrapped in soft misty light. We notice the
          (Priestess) aroma of sweet flowers. Ahead is a pool of crystal clear
          (Priestess) water, catching all the colours, shimmering rainbow mists
          (Priestess) rise from it. next to the pool a path leads to the right
          and
          (Priestess) we follow it. There are other pools in small chambers
          about
          (Priestess) the cave, they appear as mirrors to other worlds and other
          (Priestess) times, the sound of soft music fills the air. Jewel-like
          (Priestess) minerals are everywhere, the path leads upwards through
          the
          (Priestess) rock, to a chamber where we see a great cauldron, mist
          rises
          (Priestess) from it encrusting the rim with glistening beads, soft
          (Priestess) whispering can now be heard.  We stop and hold up our
          hands
          (Priestess) before the cauldron, fine sparkles of light fly from our
          (Priestess) fingers, and as we weave patterns with our hands we see,
          for
          (Priestess) a moment, a pattern of light of our creation take form,
          then
          (Priestess) dissolve to be reality elsewhere. the mist rises thickly
          (Priestess) from the cauldron and we step forward and peer into it, as
          (Priestess) through gazing into a mirror we see images of ourselves,
          an
          (Priestess) d as we gaze these images appear to change, we become
          better
          (Priestess) healthier, more perfect, with fiery glowing auras, our-
          selves
          (Priestess) improving within and without.
          (Priestess) We step back and throw a kiss toward the cauldron, spar-
          kles
          (Priestess) of light explode in the air, we look and listen for a
          while,
          (Priestess) then turn and begin to retrace our steps....
          (Priestess) Once again we pass through the chamber of the pools, with
          (Priestess) its glistening jewels an d soft music, out into the bright
          (Priestess) moonlight  the forested hillside about us, behind us the
          (Priestess) cave entrance, down through the trees we pass across the
          (Priestess) meadow, with its whispering grasses and gleaming fire-
          flies,
          (Priestess) our robes floating gossamer upon the air, silently we
          move.
          (Priestess) Ahead on the horizon the storm flashes, small creatures



                                                                            2147

          (Priestess) rustle in the grasses, our shadows move with us haloed in
          (Priestess) moonlight, we move rapidly through the trees and across
          the
          (Priestess) meadow, ahead we see the faint glimmer of our own portal,
          (Priestess) growing larger, brighter as we approach. we stop before it
          (Priestess) and look around, one last look at the moonlit meadow, the
          (Priestess) forest, the hills , the fireflies, the mist. Then we step
          (Priestess) through.  We are in the circle again. We go to our bodies
          (Priestess) and settle comfortably down within them.  We have retur-
          ned.
          (Priestess) I call Rilla
          (Priestess) Rilla, enter into the Center of the Circle!
          (Rilla) I enter into the center of the circle
          (Priestess) Children of the night, send forth your power to this our
          (Priestess) Sister, that she feel the relief of our touch.
          (Priestess) (visualize healing fire flowing from your hands to Rilla)
          (Priestess) (and that any aches and pains are melted away  and flow
          (Priestess) into the ground for transmutation)
          (Priestess) Rilla, when you feel full of power, earth the extra
          part...
          (Rilla) <I send the spiral of the breath into the earth.....>
          (Priestess) and return to your place in the Circle.
          (Rilla) <and with it flows all pain and burden>...
          (Rilla) <and breathe the spirit of the earth back to my heart>
          (Rilla) <and out again to my brothers and sisters>....
          (Rilla) I thank you...
          (Rilla) Blessed Be...
          (Rilla) <returning to place in the circle>
          (Priestess) Blessed Be!
          (Priestess) Is there any others that have a boon to ask tonight in
          this
          (Priestess) Night of Power?
          (Rilla) I ask a boon.
          (Rilla) To send the healing power we have gathered here...
          (Rilla) to our brother, Otter...
          (Rilla) so that he may feel our love and healing touch.
          (Priestess) We concentrate on the center of the Circle...
          (Priestess) and a shadowy figure forms.  The shape of Otter
          (Priestess) takes form, and once again, the Healing Fire reaches
          (Priestess) out to touch and caress.
          (Priest) The figure waves it's thanks, and gradually fades away,
          leaving
          (Priest) behind the echoes of it's Blessed Be!
          (Priest) Are there any other boons or wishes?
          (Rilla) Healing for those not with us?
          (Rilla) Berrywine, our sister...
          (Rilla) and Alexandra too.
          (Priest) Heh, We are deep enough for that too.
          (Priest) We spread the circle, and many shapes and forms
          (Priest) begin to appear.  Brothers and Sisters that cannot
          (Priest) be here in the Now, but that are always with us.
          (Priest) And once more, with a rumbling from deep in the earth...
          (Priest) the Healing Fire once more flows forth, and lightning
          (Priest) cracks across the sky in response, power to power...
          (Priest) and the shadowy figures straighten up, lose their pain,

          (Priest) and smiling, slowly fade away.  Blessed Be.
          (Priestess) Any others?
          (Priestess) Any items to be charged?  We accept Goddess Charge and
          Lady Visa  (grin)
          (I.D.) for Brad...
          (Shadow Hawk) I have a request, I have a wand that I picked up in the
          Isle of Man
          (Shadow Hawk) a wand of Ash from a mountain that our brothers and
          sisters died on
          (Shadow Hawk) during the Burning Times.  I would like to charge it
          with the energy
          (Shadow Hawk) of the night.  I place it on the altar in the center of
          the Circle...
          (Priest) Visualize the Fire flowing once more, not healing, but
          bonding
          (Priest) with power, sealing the Wand to do the Lady's Will.
          (Priest) So mote it be!
          (Priestess) Any others?
          (Rilla) Ingrid mentioned Brad....
          (Rick B) Charge his monitor! <g>

          (Priest) mysterious is the sweetness and most intoxicating of all
          (Priest) human experience.

          (Priestess) the significance of that which has been said.

          pulling at you

          ergy...
          (1-1,S.H.) and with each exhale, push it down through your feet into
          the earth...
          (1-1,S.H.) the connection grows stronger, and the barriers break down

          EXPLANATORY NOTES

          Awahili is Cherokee for Eagle, the spirit keeper of the East. This is
          the messenger
          to the powers and the bird of the chieftain.

          Sistu is Cherokee for Rabbit. the spirit keeper of the South for the
          Eastern
          Woodland Indians. Western Indians use the Coyote her. In any case it
          represents
          teaching through humor or by showing how NOT to do things. Think of
          the B'rer Rabbit
          stories: "Please 
          don thro me in dat briar patch!"



                                                                            2162

          Yanu is Cherokee for Bear, the spirit keeper of the West. Yanu is the
          healer, she
          who gave the sweat lodge to the people and the bear is the chief of
          the council of
          the four-leggeds. The thunders are 'chancy' powers, sometimes good and
          sometimes
          evil.

          Yunsu is Cherokee for Buffalo, the spirit keeper of the North. Yes,
          buffalo once
          roamed a lot of the East! The buffalo provides for our mundane needs
          with food,
          clothing, shelter and, in the planes, fuel. For the Sioux (Lakota) the
          buffalo also
          gives the sacred pipe to the people, their communication with the
          powers.

          Agisegua is the Great female or Great Doe of the Cherokee. There are
          other female
          power figures which might have been used including the Corn Mother.

          Galunlati is 'him above' in Cherokee and is one of many possible names
          for deity
          above.

          Agayunli means "old" and refers to 'ancestors'; the grandmothers and
          grandfathers
          who are the wise ones. 'Grandmother' and/or 'Grandfather' were used as
          respectful
          address to persons considered wise without regard to actual kinship.

          Nunahi are the spirits and totems which surround us. It might be
          translated as the
          'immortals'.

                                                                            2170

          (1-9,Lars) <passing chalice to Annina>
          (1-3,Annina) <taking a sip>
          (1-3,Annina) <smiles all around>
          (1-6,HP) Blessed be Annina!
          (1-3,Annina) Blessed be to all!
          (1-6,HP) OK, can we continue, still a bit to do before we close...
          (1-4,Greg) Has everyone had cakes and wine?
          (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) yes.
          (1-3,Annina) <taking a bite of cake> Yes, thanks. :-)
          (1-6,Ted & Nanette) yes.
          (1-4,Greg) Lets continue

          (1-6,HP) Now the celebration is almost through,
          (1-6,HP) And I would like to request of you,
          (1-6,HP) Work with me to make the sky blue.
          (1-6,HPS) The earth is our mother
          (1-6,HPS) From the start she has been there for us
          (1-6,HPS) And at the end she will remain
          (1-6,HP) As we care for each other in this physical world
          (1-6,HP) So must we care for our mother earth
          (1-6,HP) For now is a time with smoky air
          (1-6,HP)     now is a time with oceans of oil
          (1-6,HP)     now is a time with soil of garbage
          (1-6,HPS) Magic is in me.  Magic is in you.
          (1-6,HPS) Let us spend just a minute and think
          (1-6,HPS) For collective thoughts is the magic for all
          (1-6,HPS) Think and create.  For in our power lies enough to change
          (1-6,HPS) that which others deem a lost cause.
          (1-6,HPS) Think now, one and all, about the beautiful mother.  Healthy
          and...
          (1-6,HPS) happy and free from the diseases we have previously given
          her....
          (1-6,HPS) Let's make the magic happen.  See the mountains in the
          crystal clear...
          (1-6,HPS) sky.  See the clean oceans sparkling blue.  See her beauty
          under the...
          (1-6,HPS) full moon light.  Think...
          (1-6,HP) So Mote It Be!

          (1-6,HP) Greg, it was a bit unusual to see magic for you mom appearing
          in the...
          (1-6,HP) drawing down.  I've been under the belief that once magic is
          done is...
          (1-6,HP) should be left alone.  For any doubt will destroy the res-
          ults....
          (1-6,HP) Should we work more magic for her now, or should we call it
          done?...
          (1-6,HP) It's your call.
          (1-4,Greg) What we've worked felt pretty powerful...
          (1-4,Greg) I think it will do, my mother doesn't exactly know I asked
          for this.
          (1-6,HP) Well then, Thought of her will remain clear in all of us. 
          Thoughts...
          (1-6,HP) of her happy and healthy.  It is done.
          (1-4,Greg) Blessed Be!

          (1-6,HP) Does anyone want any other collective magic to be done, now
          is the...
          (1-6,HP) time.
          (1-3,Annina) I'd like you all to remember my husband's and my busin-
          ess. We are starting
          (1-3,Annina) it this week on a virtual shoestring as our venture
          capital deal fell through.
          (1-3,Annina) Your thoughts and meditations in your rituals would be
          very much appreciated.
          (1-6,HP) What is the business and where?  What are your goals?  I
          learned...
          (1-6,HP) long ago not to ask for vague things, they sneak up and bite
          you in...
          (1-6,HP) the butt.  That's an experience Loki taught me.
          (1-3,Annina) The business is a point of sales computer systems com-
          pany. We're in
          (1-3,Annina) Pensacola, Florida (on the Gulf Coast near Mobile, Ala.)
          (1-3,Annina) Our goals are to make 8 sales per month for the first 90
          days.
          (1-6,HP) Not too bad.
          (1-3,Annina) That will give us the capital to get things underway with
          an office and
          (1-3,Annina) a demo system.
          (1-6,HP) Everyone here please visualize Annina's company selling 30
          sales by...
          (1-3,Annina) We're running it out of our home at the moment. It's
          scary, but we KNOW
          (1-3,Annina) the business is there and we've done our homework and
          made the connections.
          (1-6,HP) the end of 90 days.  Envision happiness and of course wealth
          for...
          (1-6,HP) Annina and her husband.  From this thought in your heart turn
          it to...
          (1-6,HP) a color and send it to her now.
          (1-6,HP) Well Annina, I hope I didn't zap you.  In my vision I saw you
          so...
          (1-6,HP) busy after 60 days that you needed to hire help to handle all
          the...
          (1-3,Annina) WOW!! Green and pink and purple! Mostly green though. :-)
          (1-6,HP) work.  You will be successful.  As long as you remember that
          which...
          (1-6,HP) you want.
          (1-6,HPS) Great!
          (1-3,Annina) I definitely felt your strength!! Many thanks to all!
          (1-6,HP) Can we close or does anyone have naything else to add?
          (1-4,Greg) Best of blessings to you, Aninna, and your Husband
          (1-3,Annina) Thank you, Greg, and brightest blessings to you and your
          mother.
          (1-4,Greg) Many thanx!
          (1-6,HP) So be it!  Let us close this circle!
          (1-5,Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be!

                                          SAMHAIN RITUAL 
                                  WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 30th, 1991 
           
                                   On-Line Ritual Facilitators:   
                                   Keymaster -- Priest 
                                   Otterkin  -- Priestess 
           
           
          (8-13,Shadow Hawk) Hello all, Blessing Be among Thou. 
          (8-3,John & Karen) Hi. 
          (8-5,keymaster) Ok we are ready now. 
          (8-10,Jehana & Jeff) ready here. 
          (8-4,Tapestry) Ready. 
          (8-3,John & Karen) ready 
          (8-12,Frodo) I'm here, dunno for how long. 
          (8-6,Grey Owel) ready 

          (8-5,keymaster) Tonight we celebrate the Sabbat Samhain, 
               the eve of the New Year. 
               This is the time when the Goddess in her aspect as Crone 
               veils Her face and the 
               Horned One takes His throne. 
               It is a time to reap the good 
               and to banish the bad. 
               To this end, we folded paper with that 
               which we would banish written upon it. 
               With the old year dying 
               and the new year yet to be born, 
               it is also the time when the dead 
               may be invited to leave Caer Arianrhod 
               and join us in the ritual and 
               the feasting afterward. 
               During the feast, the Lord of Misrule 
               reigns and is free to inflict his 
               Puckish like humor on us all. 
               Welcome all, and let us begin. 

          (8-5,keymaster) Take a deep breath..... 
               and let it out slowly... 
               Relax, 
               and visualize the link between us... 
               Scattered to the winds are we, 
               but we are here together.... 

          (8-8,Otterkin)  We enter a grove amidst tall oaks, lit by a 
               waning moon and a circle of torches.  It is a 
               warm indian summer night with little wind, and an 
               aura of expectancy flickers like the flames.  Our 
               altar stands at the North, decorated with apples 
               and pomegranates, nuts and corn.  There is an 
               empty plate and a hand-thrown earthenware bowl 
               filled with fresh water.  A chalice holds the 
               wine.  The cakes are slices of pumpkin bread with 
               raisins, and oatmeal cookies.  The small cauldron 
               of cleansing is of old polished brass with a 



                                                                            2174

               handle for carrying. 
               A large, black iron dutch-oven stands on its 
               three legs in the center of the circle.  Wisps of 
               smoke rise upward and tongues of flame reach 
               beyond it's rim.  Four unlit torches lay near it. 
               Here the callers of the Guardians will light 
               their torches, to place them in empty sconces 
               planted in the earth at the North, East, South, 
               and West.  There are small buckets of water 
               beside each sconce. 
               Because we are modern pagans, the Priestess has 
               brought a boom-box with appropriate music. 
               Listen inside yourself and you will hear it. 
           
               Focus on the water in the chalice. 
               a symbol of cleansing and rebirth. 
               I add a dagger-tip of salt to represent 
               the aspects of the earth. 
               Great Mother, bless this cup that we  
               may be cleansed. 
               (The chalice is passed clockwise, with each 
               of us sprinkling ourselves.) 
               (When this is done, I return the chalice 
               to the altar.) 

          (8-5,keymaster) The incense we have chosen for this night is
               juniper and myrrh. 
               It burns with the charcoal in the small brass cauldron. 
               Breathe it in, and think of fire and air together. 
               Let the strength and joy they represent 
               become a part of you. 
               Great Father, bless this fire and air 
               that we may be purified as it passes over and through us. 
               (Cauldron is passed clockwise around the circle, by its
               handle) 
               (When all have breathed it, the Priest returns it to the  
               altar.)
           
          (8-7,Otterkin) The ground beneath us has been sprinkled 
               with ginger and swept to remove all negativity 
               from this space.  Let us join together 
               and in the names of Danu the Great Mother 
               and Arianrhod the White Lady, 
               and of Cernunnos the Hunter, 
               I cast and consecrate this Circle. 
               (I draw the invoking Pentagram in the air 
               with one hand and then, with a long stick 
               from a hazel tree, draw the circle deosil, 
               North to North.) 
           
          (8-5,keymaster) Let the caller of the Guardian of the East, step
               forward. 

          (8-4,Tapestry) Lords of the East, Masters of inspiration,
               intelligence, new beginnings, and the wind rattling my

               windows this night, Hail and Welcome. (Light Torch & place
               in sconce) 

          (8-5,keymaster) Let the Caller of the Guardian of the South, step
               forward.
           
          (8-10,Jehana & Jeff) Lords of the South, may your fires burn
               hearty during the coming darknesses, 
               May your Will be strong upon us; with us.   
               Hail & Welcome (Light torch & place in sconce.) 

          (8-5,keymaster) Let the Caller of the Guardian of the West, step
               forward. 

          (8-3,John & Karen) Lords of the West, 
               guardians of the dark ocean and the lands beyond 
               be with us now in this time between the worlds. 
               Hail and welcome. (light torch and place in sconce) 

          (8-5,keymaster) Let the Caller of the Guardian of the North, step
               forward. 

          (8-11,wanda) Lords of the North, Masters of the Earth, 
               the hills, the valley, and forests  --  
               join us now in this time of great joy 
               (light torch and place in sconce) 

          (8-7,Otterkin) (Facing the center)  The Circle is bound.

          CompuServe online Yule Ritual, 1990

          (8-2,DragonHart) Relax....let the worries of the day dissolve
               into the earth under your feet.  Breath deeply.  This is a
               journey, sacred and magical.  Prepare yourself for that
               journey. 
               * 
               Yule is a time of change.  Death and rebirth are the  
               themes that this holiday brings to us.  We enter this sacred
               time anxious for the birth and growth of the Sun God.  We
               naturally go through many changes during this time.  We make
               resolutions to do better, to give up things that keep us
               from growing.
               *
               In our mind's eye we draw a circle of Power.  Our blade
               travels at astounding speeds, dividing us from the rest of
               the natural world.  We are set apart, between worlds. 
               *
               Taking the chalice of water, we sprinkle the circle,  
               feeling the cool liquid on our fingers.  We begin to feel
               the cleansing power of our Mother's blood.  The sprinkling
               finished, we return the chalice to the altar. 
               * 
               The smoke from the censor curls playfully around your
               fingers as you reach to pick it up.  Breath deep of the
               sweet Frankincense and Myrhh as you walk the boundries of
               the circle with it.  Let the scent drive away all negativity
               in you.  When you have finished your sacred task, place the
               censor in it's place on the altar. 
               * 
               Pause a moment to notice the unlit altar candle.

               the Child of Light.  The Mother's womb, dark like the night,
               has grown to encompass half of the earth.  Now the birth is
               at hand.  The water breaks and covers the land with snow. 
               Last years Child has grown and become King. He is now old
               and venerable, waiting to pass his solar flame onto his own
               Son that he might be born anew.  He lovingly holds the hand
               of the Lady who must endure his death and birth all in the
               same moment.

(8-1,Larne) OK all, standard procedure, a number of places after I say <ga>
            you're invited to add your own thoughts, in order of user number.
            If you don't want to add anything just say ga or something, so the 
            next person knows when to start.

            Today we meet to celebrate the spring equinox, which is also
            the first day of spring.  The time when day are night are equal,
            and the day continues to grow.  The weather is starting to get
            warmer, the days longer.  The Earth is starting to awaken, buds
            and blooms and shoots of all sorts are starting to appear.  And
            there's that unmistakable sense of spring in the air; not quite
            a smell, more like a feeling, vague and indistinct, but definitely
            there.
            ...
            
            Take a few deep breaths, in and out in and out...
            let all those worries and scheduals and plans that dominate
            most of our time turn to liquid and drip away, down into the
            ground.  Feel yourself freed from the constraints of time
            and space.  Become awake, alert, yet simultaneously relaxed
            and comfortable.
            ...

            Now, visualize a point of bright blue light to the east.
            Let it move in an arc towards the south, leaving a trail
            of cool blue fire behind it, seperating Where We Were
            from Where We Will Be.  

            Continue the arc to the south,

            then to the west

            then to the north

            then back to to the east.
            ...

            We have now isolated ourselves from the rest of the
            everyday world, but in doing so we have all come together,
            here Between the Worlds, joined by the joyfull dance of



                                                                            2191

            electrons and other, subtler, forces.  Take a moment to
            visualise us all together, and say a mental 'hi!' to everyone
            else.
            ...

            Turn your mind's eye to the east, and visualize incense smoke.
            Within that smoke are vague forms that, although they have no
            firm shape, give off a distinct sense of great knowledge.
            ...

            Eastern spirits of the Air!  We ask you to join us in our
            celebration and to share with us your gifts of undertsanding
            and insight.  Welcome!

(8-6,Jehana) Hail and welcome, refreshing breezes! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) march winds that shake the walls of my house tonight...Welcome! 
              <ga>

(8-1,Larne) Now turn to the south, and visualize dancing flames.  See
            the indistinct forms there, and feel their strength.  These
            are obviously entities who can accomplish anything they
            strive for!
            ...

            Southern spirits of Fire!  We ask you to join our celebration,
            to help us manifest our own Wills into the world.  Welcome!

(8-6,Jehana) Hail & welcome, passionate spirits of fiery will! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) welcome to our celebration dear warriors of the heart. <ga>

(8-1,Larne) Turn now to the west, and think of a large body of water.  Within
            its depths move other forms, beings whose emotions and capacity
            for empathy are as deep as the waters they move in.
            ...

            Western spirits of Water!  We ask you to join us in our 
            celebration, and to help us touch our own deep emotional cores. 
            Welcome!

(8-6,Jehana) Hail & Welcome, waters of Intuition! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) welcome wisdom of the deeps, join our celebration and cleanse 
              and heal us. <ga> 

(8-1,Larne) Concentrate now on the north, and think of a patch of ground.
            Under it other entities move, entities that, though they are
            as without absolute shape as the others, are somehow extremely
            solid at the same time.
            ...

            Northern spirits of Earth!  We ask you to join in our celebration,
            and to remind us by your presence that each of us, also has a
            solid center that is as firm and real as the Earth Herself.
            <ga>

(8-3, Felix Culpa) AGLA (tracing pentagram) ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Wee, spirits of the earth, bring us your strength. ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail & welcome, bones of the land herself! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) sweet earth ones welcome to our celebration. <ga>

(8-1,Larne) Finally, turn back to the east, and complete the circle.
            Bright Mother, Goddess of the grass and trees, beautifull
            Lady of the gentle rains that nurish the soil, please
            join us!  We meet today to honor You, and to share Your
            joy in the life springing up around us.  Welcome!

             land! ga

(8-1,Larne) Green Man, Herne, Radiant Sun that warms and lights us,
            God of the woods where once again bright spring colors
            are beginning to appear, we ask you to join us as well!
            Come, wake us from the long winter sleep, into the
            bright, green world!
            <ga>

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Come forth, O HORUS
                   Ye Crowned and Conquering Child
                   Come Ye forth and partake of our celebration. ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail & welcome, Hunter Herne! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) a thousand welcomes oh laughing one. <ga>

(8-1,Larne) The Lord and Lady take hands, and slowly begin to dance
            across fields that have lain cold and hard all winter.
            Grains, grasses, flowers, young animals, all come out
            of their dark homes to see them and be nurished by their
            love.  We too need this nurishment as we come out into
            the daylight.  Both on a physical level, as well as to
            feed those hopes and desires we keep within us.  For myself,
            I will gladly take some of this energy to help me as I
            continue my efforts at musical composition.  May the music
            spring out of me as beutiful and vibrant as the flowers
            from the ground!
            ...

            Everyone, now take this energy within to feed those
            seeds within you.  Feel free to tell us what you are
            growing, or don't if it is something special and
            private you wish to keep to yourself.
            <ga>

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Come unto me, O MUSES! ga

(8-5,Tapestry) I ask for self-confidence to grow and flourish.

(8-6,Jehana) May growth and creativity flourish within me.
             May it spread to all those who wish to share with it. ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) i breathe in the joy of spring to feed my creativity in my art 
              work and in my writing. and may i inhale the fertility of this 
              season so that i may breathe out and share it with ohters. ga

(8-1,Larne) Finally, as we rejoice in the lengthening days let
            us take a moment to think of Kuwait and the surrounding
            areas, where the thick foul smoke often prevents the sun
            from getting through at all, and chokes both plants and
            people.  Let us direct some of this nurishment to an area
            which has already suffered so much, and let us send
            our best wishes to the people who undertake the difficult
            and dangerous task of putting out all the burning oil wells.
            May a day soon come when we no longer need such dangerous
            and disgusting substances to provide our energy!

            Bright Lady and Lord, we thank you for joining us in our
            circle and sharing your love and joy with us.  We shall
            continue togrow in your presence!  Although you leave
            us now, you are always with us.  Hail and farewell!
            <ga>

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Hail and Farewell, O Ye Four Furies! ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail & farewell, Gentle Lady and Hunter Herne! ga



                                                                            2194

(8-6,Jehana) hail & farewell! ga

(8-8,>>Nan<<) hail and farewell. ga

(8-1,Larne) Now unwind the circle, letting the arc collapse back into a point

            taking it back from east

            to north

            to west

            to south,

            and back to the east,

SUMMONER: "HASTE! HASTE! NO TIME TO WAIT,
                              WE'RE OFF TO SABBAT, DON'T BE LATE!"

                   WELCOME TO THE CELEBRATION OF LAMMAS!
HP: "Lammas has come to be the Festival of First Harvest. In older times, it
was known variously as LUGHNASADH, LUGHNASANDH, LUGHANSADH, or LUGHANSANDH,
which have been translated to mean: LUGH'S FEST, LUGH'S FEAST, LUGH'S
MARRIAGE, or even LUGH'S WAKE.

ALL JOIN HANDS: "IN PERFECT LOVE AND PERFECT TRUST WE DO THIS RITE."

HPS: :In the name of the GOD and GODDESS and under their protection is this
rite now begun."

                     STANDARD OPENING FOR MOON

HP: "It has become a very nice touch at Festivals lately - holding hands and
going Sun-wise for 1/8th of a circle commemorating the turning of the Wheel
of the Year. To mark the passage of the 1/8th of a year from Midsummer to
Lammas, we'll hold hands, take tiny steps and chant:"

                              "AIR BLOW,
                               SUN SHINE.
                               WATER FLOW, 
                               EARTH DIVINE."

HPS: "We have put motion into the FESTIVAL WHEEL, the WHEEL OF LIFE. We have
now moved into the season of First Harvest."

HP + HPS: "Let us now go back to those thrilling days of yesteryear when our
ancestors were still hunting and gathering; right before the time of the
first harvest."

MAN + WOMAN step out.
MAN: "My Dear One, have you heard the news? LUGH and BRIGID are to have a
Fest."
WOMAN: "Yes My Dear Husband, we shall go to the Fest, but what can we bring
as a present that would be worthy of the GOD and GODDESS?"
MAN: "Between my hunting and your gathering we should just have enough to
make it through the coming winter, but we surely have nothing worthy of the
LORD and LADY."
WOMAN: "I know what we can do, let's go and ask the ELEMENTS if they can give
us a gift that we could give."



                                                                            2197

                            I BRING THE ENERGY,

GOD and GODDESS, who have now stepped forward.

MAN + WOMAN: "LORD and LADY, we poor humans come before you to honor you at
your Fest. Since we have nothing of our own worthy of giving to you, we
beseeched a boon of the ELEMENTS for a gift for you."

As they present the gifts they say: 
(With the gift of AIR)" AIR from which we capture the essence of blossoms,
Fall's cut wood in a blaze. Grandmother's vegetable soup, puppy breath, a
lover's familiar scent. Birds and clouds suspended as if by magic."

(With the gift of FIRE)" FIRE, combustion that rends wood into its elements
to dry wool socks, explodes corn into puffs of deliciousness, brings new
meaning to a marshmallow feast, lights our way home. The dance of colors
warms the soul of our primitive self."

(With the gift of WATER)" WATER, we are caressed, cradled, restored in our
element. Waves covered in moonlight icing. Aqua stillness. Tidepools of
edible treasures."

(With the gift of EARTH) "EARTH, fragrant, rich, bountiful. Filled with
promises of wildflowers, carrots, lilacs and heavy headed grains. Home to
bugs and beasts in great variety."

LORD + LADY: "Children, We demand aught for sacrifice, for behold We are the
Mother and Father of all things and Our love is poured out upon the Earth. We
who are the beauty of the green earth and the white moon among the stars, the
mystery of the waters, We call upon your soul to arise and come to us. For We
are the soul of nature that gives life to the universe. From Us all things
proceed and unto Us they must return. Let Our worship be in the heart that
rejoices, for behold all acts of love and pleasure are Our rituals. Let there
be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and
reverence within you. Because of your love and devotion We give you each of
the ELEMENTS you so lovingly brought to Us and We also give to you the gift
of the mysteries of husbandry and the growing and harvesting of grain. LET
THIS TIME HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE FIRST HARVEST."

GOD + GODDESS, MAN + WOMAN: (Joining hands together) 
  "MAY WINDS BLOW COOL, THE SUN SHINE WARM, THE WATER"S BRIGHT AND PURE,
        THE EARTH REGAIN HER FORMER GLORY, THE RACE OF MAN ENDURE."

HP + HPS: "In memory of that 1st FIRST HARVEST let us all partake in CAKES 
and WINE."

                              CAKES AND WINE

                               HANDFASTING RITUAL
                          FROM LADY ARDANE, ON PRODIGY

Our tradition (Fam. Trad.) uses a lovely ceremony I will post here. You may use
any or all of it that pleases you.

Our bride wears white with red Witches cord at waist, groom wears
red with white Witches cord.There is a procession led by the High
Priestess bearing the wand,and the High Priest carrying the
bells.The bride and groom are escorted by two pages. At altar the
Hps.lights candles (red & white) and Incense (Rose &
Frankincense). After charging the circle the Highpriestess who
officiates says: We gather here this Night (day) to bind together
this man and woman in a ritual of love. Let all who stand within
this circle be here of their own free will and accord in peace
and love.We charge this Circle to be filled with love. May this
sacred space be consecrated before the Gods and Goddesses and may
it be a Guardian and Protection for the work we do this night
(day). Let (name)and(name) stand here before us and in the
Presence of the Ancient Ones.

Hps goes to the East: Be with us here oh Spirits of the Air With
your breath of life, join the bonds between these two and tie
them tightly.

South: Be with us here oh Beings of Fire. Give their love and
passion your own all consuming ardor.

West: Be with us here of Beings of Water. Grant these two the
deepest of love richness of body, soul and spirit.

North: Be with us here, oh Spirits of Earth, Let your strength
and constancy be theirs for as long as they desire to be
together.

Blessed Godddess and Laughing God, look with joy on this Union of
this man and this woman. Grant them harmony and beauty in their
lives and let them be always mindful of their committment, one to
the other.  Let them so live together that their joy of each
other will be a shining beacon for all to see. Give to these two
your love and protection. SMIB.

The Priest and Priestess each hold an end of the wand and place
the rings on it. The B&G each place their right hand over the
rings on the wand. The Hps says:Above you the Stars Below you the
stones,As time passes remember this; Like a stone your love
should be firm, Be close, yet not so close that you restrict one
another. Possess one another yet grant each other freedom to
grow. Be understanding and compassionate. Have patience with each
other, for storms may come, but they will quickly go.Be free in
giving warmth and affection, make love often and be sensuous to
one another. Fear not lest the ways or words of the unenlightened
give you unease, for the God and Goddess are with you now and
always. To the bride: Is it you wish to become one with this man?
To the groom, Is it your wish to become one with this woman? Take



                                                                            2200

the charged rings from the wand and hand them to each in turn. As
they place the rings on each other they say: Let this circle of
Gold reflect the circle in which we stand to be a constant
reminder of the pledges exchanged. Let it remind us daily of the
wheel of life and the unbroken cycles of eternity. The B & G
drink out of the Chalice as the HPS says...As you share this cup
this night(day) so may you share your lives and fortunes. The B&G
remove their Witches cords and hand them to the HPs who asks the
B&G to face each other and hold hands. She then binds their hands
with the cords and says...As we bind together this man and this
woman with these cords let their fates and future be so bound.
May they hold fast to each other, even as they are now held
fast. Hps removes cords and hands them to the pages. Hps says: As
the God and Goddess and the Ancient Ones are witness to these
rites I now proclaim you to be wed, one to the other. SMIB. (Here
the B & G kiss).

The HPS goes to each of the four corners dismissing the elements
in turn by saying: We dismiss you now, Oh spirits of air
(earth,fire,water,) and ask you to return to your elemental home
harming none as you go  and taking with you our thanks for your
attendance.

And then at altar,: Dear Lady, Mother of us all,Blessed Lord of
the Woodland.. We thank you for your Attendance in our Sacred
Circle and ask your blessings on this couple and on the work we
have performed here this night (day). We dismiss you now to your
areas of governance, harming none as you go and taking with you
our thanks and love.

As we unwind our circle we place before this newly bound couple
our offerings of flowers to bring beauty to their lives and as
they represent the God and Goddess this night (day) we ask their
blessings on each of us. Merry meet and merry part and merry meet
again. The circle unwinds from the North with each guest (circle
member) kneeling before the B & G and placing fresh flowers
before them.As they kneel the B & G touches each person on the
forehead. The guests leave the altar area after this followed by
the B & G, then the pages and finally the Hp & Hps.  
I thought long and hard about posting this as a public message.
But since I wrote it, (and plagarized some of it from various
Pagan sources) and we have used it in our hand-fastings and have
found it to be appropriate and moving, I think it may be
something to be shared and enjoyed by others. Like all Pagan
rituals, use only what seems appropriate to you. Rearrange it,
re-write it or toss it out. It is, as I said, a Fam. Trad ritual.
