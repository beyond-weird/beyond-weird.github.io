             STAND UP, STAND UP FOR ODIN
                            -Robert Cook
             (Tune: "Stand Up For Jesus") 
                                        
  Stand up! Stand up for Odin, you warriors of the beard!
  lift high the Raven Banner that half the world has feared!
  From Angleland to far Vinland shall sound the Warrior's Cry
  Till every foe is vanquished, and Odin reigns most high!
                                        
  March forth with steel flashing beneath the naked Sun
  and never stand at rest again 'til all the World is won!
  Let scarlet sword his symbol carve in every nation's sod
  'Til every man still breathing stands up for OdinGod!
                                        
  Let ships with prows of Dragons the mighty oceans cleave
  and every land not Odin's our crimson gifts receive
  let Raven Banners fill the sky where every man has trod
  And all the soil beneath them belong to OdinGod!
                                        
  Stand up! Stand up for Odin, you Warriors of the North!
  With silver swords a-flashing to victory go forth!
  From Angleland to far Vinland our joyous conquest lead
  'Til every foe is vanquished, and Odin's Lord, indeed!

What the use of wearing panties         
Whalebone corsets of your Auntie's      
Boxer shorts and other scanties         
Best of all is nude                     
There's such fun in going bra-less      
Now that it's no longer lawless         
'Specially if your figure's flawless    
Best of all is nude                     
Nude is what you're born in             
Shirts are never torn in                
Underwear and lacy flimsies, garter belts and other whimsies
Yards of itchy cloth to put your form in
Ducks all do it, maidens rue it         
Even ancient Picts in Britain blue it   
Going naked's how to do it              
Best of all is nude!                    
                                        
If your garters aren't elastic          
Tie them up in knots fantastic          
(Panty hose is something drastic!)      
Best of all is nude!                    
If you're tired of wearing clotheses    
Shed your garment 'mongst the roses     
Never mind the old bluenoses            
Best of all is nude!                    
Nude is best for ducking!               
Worst for horses bucking!               
Moonlit nights will see such sights     
    that are very best for fooling round
                        .....and elbows!
Nudity is grand to see                  
A well-known antidote to virginity      
Take your clothes off and you'll see:   
Best of all is nude!

       Why should I sit and sigh        
       Broo and bracken, broo and bracken
       Why should I sit and sigh        
       All alone and weary              
                                        
       When I see the plover rising     
       Or the curlew wheeling           
       It's then I'll court my mortal lover
       Back to me is stealing           
                                        
       When the moon begins her waning  
       I sit by the water               
       Where a man born of the sunlight 
       Loved the Faerie's daughter      
                                        
       Oh, but there is something wanting
       O but I am weary                 
       Coming blithe, now bonny treads he
       O'er the knolls to cheer me

    As I walked out one quiet evening   
    At the hour of twelve at night      
    Who should I meet but a fair young maiden
    Combin' her hair by candle light;   
    Lassie, I have come a-courtin'      
    Your kind favours for to win        
    And if you'd heed my petition       
    I would be your Paladin...          
                                        
(CHORUS) Gather roses in the Springtime 
         Gather roses while ye may,     
         Time is passing; roses wither; 
         Winter comes; we're here -today-.
                                        
    Have you seen the dew a-formin'     
    On the grass at early morn?         
    Have you seen the forest quiet,     
    Or a stag that's barely born?       
    Have you seen the dawn a-breakin'   
    O'er the Western Ocean's tide?      
    Have you felt my heart a-beatin'    
    When it's held close to your side?  
                                        
    I can give no gold or silver,       
    I can give no fields of land,       
    I can give no servants brisk        
    To wait on you both foot and hand;  
    I can give you wide roads callin'   
    Wind and Rain, and Moon and Sun,    
    Songs to sing, and love and laughter,
    Dresses made of plain home-spun.    
                                        
    Come dance with me upon the greensward
    in the moonlight, in the Spring.    
    Dance with me within the forest     
    Dance with me within the ring!      
    Earth below us, stars above us,     
    Fire and water by our side,         
    Dance with me within the moonlight, 
    Dance with me, and be my Bride!

  While the Moon her watch is keeping   
                  all thru the night    
  While the weary world is sleeping     
                  all thru the night    
  O'er thy spirit gently stealing,      
  Visions of delight revealing          
  Breathes a pure and holy feeling      
                  all thru the night    
                                        
  Though this Bard must roam full lonely
  My true harp shall sing praise only   
  Love's soft dream, alas, is over      
  Yet my strains of love shall hover    
  Near the Presence of my Lover         
                                        
  Hark! A solemn bell is ringing        
  Thou, my King are heavenward winging  
  Earthly dust from off Thee shaken     
  Soul immortal shalt thou waken        
  With thy last, dim journey taken      
                                        
  Neath this Stone my King is sleeping  
  Stars around Him softly sweeping      
  Once and Future King preserving       
  Britain's Saviour there reserving     
  All around him Stars observing        
                  all thru the night

          note: The last verse is phonetic Welsh.
                "ll" is pronounced by putting the tip of your
                tongue to the roof of your mouth, and saying "h"
                and "l" at the same time...sort of.
                "ch" is pronounced as German.

  She looked out of the window, as white as any milk
  He looked in at the window, as black as any silk
                                        
  (Chorus): Hello, hello, hello, hello you coal black smith
            You have done me no harm!   
            You never shall have my maidenhead
            That I have kept so long!   
            I'd rather die a maid, aye, and then she said,
            And be buried all in my grave,
            Than to have such a nasty,  
            husky, dusky, fusty, musty coal black smith!
            A maiden I will die!        
                                        
  She became a duck, a duck all in the stream
  And he became a waterdog, and fetched her back again
                                        
  She became a star, a star all in the night
  And he became a thundercloud and muffled her out of sight
                                        
  She became a rose, a rose all in the wood
  And he became a bumblebee and kissed her where she stood
                                        
  She became a nun, a nun all dressed in white
  And he became a chantry priest to pray for her by night
                                        
  She became a trout, a trout all in the brook
  And he became a feathered fly, and catched her with his hook
                                        
  She became a quilt, a quilt all on her bed

  There were three men come out of the West 
  Their fortunes for to try,            
  And these three men made a solemn vow:
  John Barleycorn should die!           
  John Barleycorn should die!           
                  (nb: 4th line of each verse is sung twice)
                                        
  They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,
  Threw clods upon his head,            
  And these three men made a solemn vow:
  John Barleycorn was dead!             
                                        
  CHORUS: Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
          Sing fa la la lay oh!         
          Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
          Sing fa la la lay oh!         
                                        
  They let him lie for a very long time 
  'Til the rain from Heaven did fall,   
  Then Little Sir John sprung up his head,
  And so amazed them all!               
                                        
  They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide,
  'Til he grew both pale and wan,       
  Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard,
  And so became a man!                  
                                        
  They hired men with the sythes so sharp
  To cut him off at the knee            
  They rolled him and tied him about the waist,
  And used him barbarously!             
                                        
  They hired men with the sharp pitchforks
  To pierce him to the heart,           
  And the loader he served him worse than that,
  For he tied him in a cart!            
                                        
  They wheeled him around and around the field,
  'Til they came to a barn,             
  And there they made a solemn mow      
  Of poor John Barleycorn,              
                                        
  They hired men with the crab-tree sticks
  To strip him skin from bone           
  And the Miller he served him worse than that:
  For he ground him between two stones! 
                                        
  They have wheeled him here and wheeled him there
  And wheeled him to a barn,            
  And they have served him worse than that
  They have bunged him in a vat!

  They have worked their will on John Barleycorn
  But he lived to tell the tale;        
  For they pour him out of an old brown jug,
  And they call him home-brewed ale!    
                                        
  Here's Little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl,
  And brandy in a glass!                
  And Little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl
  Proved the stronger man at last!      
                                        
  For the huntsman he can't hunt the fox
  Nor loudly blow his horn,             
  And the tinker can't mend kettles nor pots
  Without John Barleycorn!

             THE FALSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD (Child #3)

        "Oh where are you going to?"    
                       said the False Knight upon the road
        "Oh I'm going to my school."    
                       said the wee boy and still he stood
        "What is that upon your back?"  
                       said the False Knight upon the road
        "Ah weel, it is my books!"      
                       said the wee boy and still he stood
                                        
 Oh, what have you got there?           I wish you was on the sands.
 I have got my bread and cheese!        Yes, and a good staff in my hands!
 Oh won't you give me some?             I wish you was on the sea.
 No, ne'r a bite or crumb!              And a good ship under me!
                                        
                       And the ship to sink.
                       An inch away from shore!
                       I think I hear a bell.
                       And it rings you straight to Hell!

    In Nottamun Town, in Nottamun Town  
    Not a soul would look up not a soul would look down
    Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
    To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
                                        
    I bought me a horse t'was called a grey mare
    Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
    Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
    Weren't a hair upon her that was not coal black
                                        
    She stood so still threw me to the dirt
    She tore at my hide, she bruised my shirt
    From saddle to stirrup I mounted again
    and on my ten toes I rode over the plain
                                        
    When I got there no one did I see   
    they all stood around me just looking at me
    i called for a cup to drive gladness away
    And stifle the dust for it rained the whole day
                                        
    And the King and the Queen and the company more
    Came a riding behind and a walking before
    Come a stark naked drummer beating a drum
    With his hands in his bosom came marching along
                                        
    Sat down on a hard hot cold frozen stone
    Ten thousand stood round me but I was alone
    Took my heart in my hand to keep myself warm
    Ten thousand was drowned that never was born

  In the mountains of Cambria, by Rhymney's bright stream
  I have oft slept in heather, and dreamed a bright Dream
  No mortal could wake me, nor see what I've seen
  No landscape could ever compare.      
                                        
  'Twas the Land of my Fathers, unfettered, and free
  Ere the time that the Saxon swept over the Sea
  When mistletoe grew 'neath the shining Oak Tree
  No landscape could ever compare!      
                                        
  (Chorus): Dreaming of Prydein, asleep on a hill
            When I awaken, will you be there still?
            Oh, Island of Poets, my dreams you can fill
            But never the long waking hours.
                                        
  Mighty Poets and Warriors traversed every road
  Leaving stories and legends wherever they strode
  Their pasts are recalled in the humblest abode
  In tales of the sunnier days.         
                                        
  (Chorus)                              
                                        
  Now my story is ended, my song is all gone
  I have slept thru the evening, and into the dawn
  Yet still, I remember your Face, Albion,
  And your older, and much wiser ways!

                              -Padraic Colum
                  recorded by Theodore Bikel
                                        
   My young love said to me: My mother won't mind
   And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind
   She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!
                                        
   Then she stepped away from me, and she moved thru the Faire
   And so fondly I watched her move here and move there
   At last she turned homeward, with one star awake
   As the Swan in the evening moves over the lake.
                                        
   Last night she came to me, my dead love came in
   And so soft did she move that her feet made no din
   She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!

                           -Wm. Butler Yeats

          I went out to the hazel - wood
          Because a fire was in my head 
          Cut and peeled a hazel - wand 
          Tied a berry to a thread      
          And when white moths were on the wing
          And moth - white stars were flickering out
          I dropped the berry in a stream
          And caught a little silver trout..........
                                        
          I had but laid it on the bank 
          And gone to blow the fire a-flame
          Something rustled in the air  
          Something called me by my name!
          It had become a glimmering Girl
          With apple - blossom in her hair
          Who called me by my name, and ran
          And vanished in the brightening air........
                                        
          Though I am old, with wandering
          Thru hilly lands, and hollow lands;
          I'll find out where she has gone
          To seek her lips, to take her hands-
          And walk thru long green dappled grass;
          To pluck 'til Time, and times are done:
          The Silver Apples of the Moon;
          The Golden Apples of the Sun...............

  Yggdrasil, where Nine Worlds clash, is a noble piece of ash
  That shelters Norns and Gods and all that crew
  There, a Dragon gnaws the base of an Eagle's resting place,
  And four Harts, a Goat and Squirrel are there too!
                                        
  Frigga took a year or so, and, except for mistletoe
  Got from everything an Oath for Balder's good
  Evil Loki wished him harm, so he hired Hodr's arm,
  And the staff the Blind God threw was kissing-wood!
                                        
  Tyr vowed Fenris-Wolf his hand if he couldn't break the Band
  That All-Father's wisdom made both light and hefty...
  Lupine muscles strained away, but the magic held its' sway -
  And from then on, till The Time, they called Tyr "Lefty!"
                                        
  When Thor went out to fish, he quickly got his wish,
  and he hauled a Jormangandr from the Bay.
  But Hymr cut the cable, and Thor was only able
  To brag about the "one that got away..."
                                        
  When Thor called upon the Giants, they didn't show defiance,
  But they soon got rid of him, and of his Hammer!
  For the sea he could not swallow, and old Grandmaw beat him hollow,
  And the House-Pet caused an awful katzenjammer!
                                        
  Asa-Thor became a "her" for to repossess Mjollnir,
  And unto a frosty brute his troth did plight;
  But the vittles that he ate would an army more than sate,
  And the chefs at Utgard always rued that night!
                                        
  Each God's Apple every day, kept the doctor far away
  'Til a Giant captured Ydun from their Halls...
  Loki fetched home Bragi's Bride, with Her health-food store beside,
  Plus a char-broiled eagle underneath the Walls!
                                        
  Odin said to Mim: "I think I would sort of like a drink."
  Answered Mim: "That will cost you your left eye!   
  For you've come up very late to the Well at Wisdom's Gate
  And the set-up prices, after hours, are high!"
                                        
  Oh, the Giants brought their War up to Bifrost's very Door
  And the battling wrecked Asgards perfect clime-
  Jormungandr, Hel and Fenris dealt out Death in doses generous
  And, in fighting, did the Aesir pass The Time!

            We fly through the night skies
            Flashing our fat thighs,    
            Picking up dead guys;       
            You call this a job?

            I'll take the redhead!

            Let him go . . . splat!

             GOD IS ALIVE, MAGIC IS AFOOT
                   -Leonard Cohen (c) 1966
                                        
 God is alive.....Magic is afoot...God is alive....magic is afoot...
 God is afoot.....Magic is alive...Alive is afoot..magic never died!
                                        
 God never sickened. Many poor men lied. Many sick men lied.
 Magic never weakened. Magic never hid. Magic always ruled. God is afoot. 
 God never died!                        
                                        
 God was Ruler, though his funeral lengthened.
 Though His mourners thickened, magic never fled.
 Though His shrouds were hoisted the naked God did live;
 Though His words were twisted the naked magic thrived;
 Though His death was published round and round the world
 The heart did not believe.             
                                        
 Many hurt men wondered. Many struck men bled.
 Magic never faltered. Magic always led.
 Many stones were rolled, but God would not lie down!
 Many wild men lied.                    
 Many fat men listened.                 
 Though they offered stones, magic still was fed!
 Though they locked their coffers, God was always served.
                                        
 Magic is afoot....God is alive....     
 Alive is afoot....Alive is in command. 
                                        
 Many weak men hungered.                
 Many strong men thrived.               
 Though they boasted solitude, God was at their side.
 Nor the dreamer in his cell, nor the captain on the hill:
 Magic is alive!                        
 Though His death was pardoned 'round and 'round the world,
 The heart would not believe!           
                                        
 Though laws were carved in marble they could not shelter men;
 Though altars built in Parliaments, they could not order men;
 Police arrested magic and magic went with them, ah!
 For magic loves the hungry....         
                                        
 But magic would not tarry, it moves from arm to arm,
 It would not stay with them; it cannot come to harm:
 Magic is afoot! It cannot come to harm.
 It rests in an empty palm. It spawns in an empty mind.
 But magic is no instrument: magic is the End!
                                        
 Many men drove magic, but magic stayed behind; Many strong men lied.
 They only passed thru magic and out the other side!
 Many weak men lied.                    
 They came to God in secret and though they left Him nourished, 
 They would not tell Who healed;        
 Though mountains danced before them, they said that God was dead!
 Though His shrouds were hoisted, the naked God did live!

 This I mean to laugh with in my mind:  
 This I mean my mind to serve

 And Time itself, the magic length of God!

In the air their song is comin          And in fighting we will wallow         
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  Till we wind up in Valhallow           
But they're good enough for me!         Which is good enough for me!

Riding Beetles, not Impalas          Though the tremblin' got forbodin'     
Singing "Deutschland Uber Alles"     Then the giants finally strode in,     
And that's good enough for me!       But it's good enough for me!
                                                                           
It was good enough for Loki          Shall we sing a verse for Thor,        
It was good enough for Loki          Though he leaves the maidens sore?     
He thinks Thor's a little hokey      They always come back for more,        
And that's good enough for me!       So he's good enough for me!            
                                        
Shall we sing in praise of Loki,     It was good for Thor and Odin          
Though he left poor Midgard smokey?  It was good for Thor and Odin          
Oh, his sense of humor's hokey,      Grab an axe and get your woad on!      
But he's good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!           
                                                                              
All the Gods tore into Loki        We will worship now with vigor            
Saying Deicide is hokey!           The goddess known as Frigga               
And they threw him in the pokey!   Tho there are some who don't dig her      
And that's good enough for me!     She is good enough for me!                
                                                                    
Good old Thor's the god of thunder   If you wanna worship Odin 
Really helps us get our plunder      You don't have to have a coat on 
Tho his head's still truly dunder    Grab a sword and slap some woad on  
He is good enough for me!            And that's good enough for me! 
                                        
In the halls of Frey and Freyja          We will sing a verse for Loki     
All the priestesses will lay ya          He's the old Norse god of Chaos
If you're good enough, they'll pay ya!   Which is why this verse don't          
And that's good enough for me!             rhyme or scan or nothin'         
                                         But it's good enough for me...    
                                        
                                BRUJA:  
                                        
                     Let us sing for Brujaria                       
                     Though the blood's a lot less cleaner;
                     It's not Christian Santaria             
                     So it's good enough for me!

                               BUDDHISM:                                        
                                        
We will all go to Nirvana               Oh we all will follow Buddah           
So be sure to mind your manners         Oh we all will follow Buddah           
Make a left turn at Savannah            And we'll eat no food but Gouda        
And we'll see the Promised Land!        Which is Gouda-nuff for me!
                                        

It was good enough for Buddha,          We will go and sing "Hosanna"          
As a god he's kinda cute-a,             To our good ol' pal, Gautama,          
And he comes in brass or pewta'         He will never flim or flam ya',        
So he's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!         
                                                                               
No one wrote a verse for Buddah      We will all go to Nirvana         
Tho I think they really coulda       We will all go to Nirvana         
And I really think they shoulda      Make a left turn at Urbana         
'Cause he's good enough for me!      And you'll see the Promised Land!      
                                        
                       CARGO CULT & PACIFIC ISLANDS:             
                                        
To the tune of Handel's "Largo"       If you get too tired           
We will hymn the gods of Cargo        And you need to get up higher    
'Til they slap on an embargo          Just have Pele light your fire!    
And that's good enough for me!        From her island in the sea!     
                                           
                You can keep your saints with halos,
                Your hosannas or dayenus:
                Let's throw virgins in volcanos!
                And that's good enough for me!
                                        
                               CHRISTIAN:                      
                                                 
We will worship with the Fundies      There are those who worship Satan      
With their itchy hair-shirt undies    And are just anticipatin'              
If they don't bring "Mrs. Grundy,"    Armageddon's conflagratin'             
Then it's good enough for me!         That ain't good enough for me!         
                                                                               
It was good for old Jehovah         Let's all listen up to Jesus           
He had a son who was a nova!        He says rich folks like old Croesus    
Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!   Will be damned until Hell freezes      
Another resurrection Day!           And that don't sound good to me!
                                                                               
Jerry Falwell thinks he's sav-ed        Oh we'll all be Fundamental            
In a lamb's blood he's been lav-ed      And be Holy Testamental                
And HE thinks that I'M deprav-ed        And never Trancendental                
But that's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!         
                                                                               
That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers    We will finally pray to Jesus
Fighting demons in his callers         From our sins we hope he frees us     
Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS!   Eternal life he guarantees us         
And that's good enough for me!         And that's good enough for me!         
                                        
Tho J.C.'s into fish, too,            Anytime that I start hearin'     
He's an avatar of Vishnu              "Jesus loves you" I start leerin'
So he is welcome here, too,           Maybe so, but not like Brian *
And that's good enough for me!        Which is good enough for me!

Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the "Land of the Free!"          Now he's got the ransom fee!
                                        
Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you "hotter than a pistol"        More a jumper and a squealer

Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.

Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!
                                        
Whether Low Church or it's High Church  And the Romans said of Jesus
Or it's Pie-Up-In-The-Sky Church        "Lets kill him, he don't please us"
Come on down and visit my Church        "But the Atheists will tease us"
'Cause it's good enough for me!         And thats good enough for me
                                        
You could join Jehovah's Witness             And let's not forget Pelagius
Running door to door for fitness             Though some call him outrageous
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,  He is pious and courageous
Then thats good enough for me                And he's good enough for me!

We will go to worship Zeus           You can dance and wave the thyrsos     
Though his morals are quite loose    And sing lots of rowdy verses          
He gave Leda quite a goose           Till the neighbors holler curses,      
And he's good enough for me!         And that's good enough for me!
                                        
We will pray to Father Zeus           We will sing for great Diana           
In his temple we'll hang loose        Who will teach of love and honor       
Eating roast beef au jus,             But you really gotta wanna!            
And that's good enough for me!        'Cause she's tough enough for me!      
                                                                               
Shall we sing a verse for Venus,   We went off to worship Venus
Of the Gods she is the meanest,    By the Gods! You should have seen us!   
Cause she bit me on my...elbow!    Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And it's good enough for me!       But that's good enough for me! 
                                        
We will venerate old Bacchus               It was good enough for Sappho
Drinking beer and eating tacos             With her lady on her lap-o 
Til you've tried it please don't knock us  She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause it's good enough for me!            With her pagan poetry!
                                        
Let us raise a toast to Bacchus,       When we worship Bacchus            
We will raise a royal ruckus,          The ethanol will sock us           
Then we'll lay us down and f**k us     We'll all get good and raucous     
That's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!     
                                        
Diana is a little spikey           We'll sing praises to Apollo;   
And she is a little dyke-ey        Where the Sun God leads we'll follow   
You don't have to be a Psych-e     ('Though his head's a little hollow)
To know that's right for me!       He's good enough for me! 


                                                                            2322

We will worship with Poseidon         Don't neglect that shrine of Zeus'   
We will meet him when the tide's in   Tho he's lost his vital juices    
All the maidens he will ride in       The old boy still has his uses    
Then he'll give 'em all to me!        And he's good enough for me!    
                                        
All the hunters start convergin'      We will all bow to Hephaestus 
When Diana is emergin'                As a blacksmith he will test us  
It's too bad she's still a virgin     'Cause his balls are pure asbestos
But there's still hope left for me!   So he's good enough for me!  

And what about this Bacchus,          There is room enough in Hades          
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?     For lots of criminals and shadies      
Loosens women so they'll f**k us,     And disreputable ladies,               
Well, that's good enough for me!      And they're good enough for me!
                                                                               
We will all see Aphrodite             And to help things get real racous
Though she's pretty wild and flighty  The priests of Pan and Bacchus
She will meet us in her nightie       Will hold a f***ing contest!
And she's good enough for me!         And that's all right with me!
                                                                               
Oh we will go and worship Pan,          
'cause he just don't give a damn!       
Grab a woman or a man,                  
And that's good enough for me!          
                                                 
Was a time, so I've heard tell, a       We all worshipped Dionysus             
Fine and promising young fella          'Till we ran into a crisis:            
Gave his all to serve Cybele            The bar had raised its prices;         
But that's damn well not for me!        That's not good enough for me!         
                                                                               
We'll sing praises to Apollo            There's that lusty old Priapus         
Where the Sun-God leads, I'll follow    He's just itching to unwrap us.        
From Ionia to Gaul-o                    (He'd do more to us than tap us        
And that's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!)        
                                        
We will have a mighty Party          Pan's pipes got plugged last summer     
In the honor of Astarte              And it really was a bummer     
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy    Finally had to call a plumber!     
'Cause she's good enough for me!     But he's good enough for me!       
                                        
In his dancing Pan will lead them       Now Danae was sweet as flowers,
When his pipes call we will heed them   She was into golden showers;   
In truth tho, he don't need them        And that showed her Zeus' power
He's more than enough for me!           And that's good enough for me!
                                        
It was good enough for Venus           We will sing our staves to Venus
She'd have sighed if she'd of seen us  We will sing our staves to Venus
Letting morals come between us         Tho I think this rhyme is henious
And she's good enough for me!          But it's good enough for me!
                                        
There's one thing that I do know      Let us dance with Dionysus                
Zeus' favorite is Juno                And get drunk on wine and spices          
She's the best at doing...you know!   The Christians call them "vices"   
And that's good enough for me!        But they're good enough for me!           
                                           
It was good enough for Cupid       We will venerate old Hermes               
It was good enough for Cupid       With his staff entwined with wormies      
His wings look kind of stupid      Warding off the nasty germies             
But that's good enough for me!     And that's good enough for me!

Let's all drink to Dionysus        We will all bow down to Venus
Wine and women beyond prices!      As we dance upon Mt. Zenos         
He made a Maenad out of my Sis!    We will worship with our....voice  
And that's good enough for me!     And that's good enough for me!     
                                        
There are those who, when they've got e-   
Normous problems that are knotty           
They just take them to Hecate           We all worship Aphrodite,  
And that's good enough for me!          And Her sister bold Astarte,     
                                        They both throw a lovely party,  
In the church of Aphrodite              And that's just fine with me!  
She's a mighty righteous sightie,       
The Priestess wears a see through nightie
And she's good enough for me

Let us read works of Confucius         We used to study old Confucius
As we walk thru Massachusetts          As we sat there on our tushes
In white robes that freeze our tushes  We're learning but don't push us
But it's good enough for me!           And thats good enough for me
                                        
                                CTHULHU:                       
                                                 
We will worship mighty Cthulhu        We will worship Great Cthulhu,         
H. P. Lovecraft's big old hoodoo      We will worship Great Cthulhu,         
(1930's fiction voodoo....)           And we'll feed him Mr. Sulu            
But that's good enough for me!        'Cause that's good enough for me!      
                                        
Let us sing to Lord Cthuhlu           We will sacrifice to Yuggoth           
Don't let Lovecraft try to fool you   We will sacrifice to Yuggoth           
Or the Elder Gods WILL rule you       Burn a candle for Yog-Soggoth          
And that's good enough for me!        And the Goat With a Thousand Young
                                                                                
Of the Old Ones, none is vaster      Well it's good enough for   *
Even Cthulhu's not his master        He's a mighty kinky master  
I refer to the unspeakable   *       When you pray he goes much faster 
and that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me! 
                                        
And for those who follow Cthulhu     Let's go worship Great Cthulhu,
We have really got a lulu:           And run naked like a Zulu,
Drop a bomb on Honolulu!             You and me and Mr. Sulu,
'Cause that's good enough for you!   And that's good enough for me!  
                                        
                * - well, do YOU want to say it?

Let us sing to old Discordia            Of Great Murphy much is spoken         
Cause it's sure she's never bored ya    For his Law shall not be broken        
And if she's good enough for ya         It's not pretty when he's woken        
Then she's good enough for me!          Things go wrong for you and me!        
                                        
If your rising sign is Aries         If your god of choice is Squat         
You'll be taken by the Fairies       Well then trendy, man, you're not!
Meet the Buddah in Benares           But you'll get a parking spot!         
where he'll hit you with a pie!      And that's good enough for me!

(Golden apples for the fairest!)        Goddess of the discord there is        
Though she sometimes likes to scare us  Apple's golden, it's not ferrous       
But she's good enough for me!           And that's good enough for me!
                                        
             Let us praise the Holy Fool
             For he's breaking all the rules
             Holds you up to ridicule,  
             And that's good enough for me!
                                        
                        (THE ALMIGHTY) DOLLAR
                                        
Oh, the dollar is our Saviour     There are those who scream and holler 
If we spend Her or we save Her    And get hot under the collar
She controls all our behaviour    For their god, Almighty Dollar,
There's not enough for me!        Who is good enough for me!
                                        
             Call Him God, or call him Allah
             The priest will take your dollah
             Easy living from -your- follah-
             -wers, but sorry, -not- from me!

We will worship like the Druids,     In Pwyll's hall you will be welcome
Drinking strange fermented fluids,   But he's not at home too often      
Running naked through the woo-ids,   Spends all his time in Annwyfn  
Coz that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me!      
                                        
             I'll go get my golden sickle
             And I'll wear it where it tickles
             It ain't used for cuttin' pickles!
             And it's good enough for me!

Let us sing the praise of Horus      When we all bowed down to Nuit         
As our fathers did before us         There was really nothin' to it         
We're the New Egyptian Chorus        (Alex Sanders made me do it...)        
And we sing in harmony!              But that's good enough for me!         
                                                                           
We will venerate Bubastis            We will pray with those Egyptians

If you want in, then just ast us!    Cover subways with inscriptions,       
'cause that's good enough for me!    which is good enough for me.....!      
                                                                               
Let us all now worship Ra              We will all do praise to Horus  
And take care of our Ka                In an old Egyptian chorus         
We'll all sit round and go "Ah-h-h!"   If there's something in it for us
Which is good enough for me!           Then it's good enough for me!     
                                                                         
Here's an invitation for us            We will venerate Bubastis        
All to go and worship Horus            Cause my cat walked up and ast us

And that's good enough for me!         But it's good enough for me!

With her worshippers in trances       Drags me thru that lonesome valley    
You can learn some Hindu stances      She's disgusting act-u-all-y

Still he's good enough for me!        On that Resurrection Day!              

                                MOONIES                
                                                 
             We will worship Sun Myung Moonie
             Though we know he is a goonie
             All our money he'll have soonly 
             And that's good enough for me!
                                                 
                              NEW AGE:                                    
                                            
Oh, our Spirits will awaken             Well I'm tired of Ronald Reagan,       
Oh, our Spirits will awaken             He's too square to be a pagan,         
Watch the Universe a-quakin'            Let's all vote for Carl Sagan!         
Which is Gurdijeff to me!               He's good enough for me!
                                                                               
Timmy Leary we will sing to            I'll arise at early mornin'
And the things that he was into        When the Sun gives me the warnin'
(Well, at least it wasn't Shinto)      That the Solar Age is dawnin'
And that's good enough for me!         And that's good enough for me!
                                                               
In the sky I hear a hummin'              Just like Carlos Castenada  
It's the UFO's a-comin'                  Just like Carlos Castenada
That's not banjos that they're strummin  It'll get you sooner or later
But it's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!
                                                 
                          NEW WORLD PAGAN:                                 
                                        
Thanks to great Quetzacoatl         Some folks pray to the Great Spirit    
And his sacred axolotl              Most folks just cannot get near it     
And his gift of chocolatl           So they hate it and they fear it       
And please pass some down to me!    But it's good enough for me!           
                                                                           
Praise to Popacatapetl              Some folks worship the Kachinas        
Just a tiny cigarette'll            Some folks worship the Kachinas        
Put him in terrific fettle          They look like "deus ex machinas"     
So he's good enough for me!         But they're good enough for me!        
                                        
Now watch out for the Maya's,     Montezuma liked to start out 
They might really try to fry ya,  Rites by carrying a part out 
Sacrifice people, not papaya's,   That would really tear your heart out,
Just as long as its not me!       But it's good enough for me!  
                                        
Quetzacoatl's flyin'                  And when old Quetzacoatl     
With the Toltec and the Mayan         Found a virgin he could throttle     
And the mushrooms he's been buyin'    And put her heart into a bottle     
Are good enough for me!               It was good enough for me.

We will worship Xochipilli          We will worship Xipe-Totec
Though it might be a bit silly      Tho it is a little lo-tek *
Running naked makes me chilly       It is not a bit ero-tek (erotic)
But it's good enough for me!        But it's good enough for me!

Oh, there's none like Huizlipochtli   The Kachinas of the Hopi
For destroyin' people tot'ly          Dance about and some act dopey
Best to worship -him- remotely!       They don't leave you feelin' mopey
But he's good enough for me!          So they're good enough for me!
                                        
I have gotten in the way-o              
Walkin' with the Monster Slayer         
He is worthy of a prayer

L. Ron Hubbard liked precision           In matters Dianetic        
And he founded a religion                You need not get frenetic        
That has caught a lot of pigeons         Make your Engrams copacetic        
And it's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!

There are some who practice Shinto     I don't really go for Shinto     
There are some who practice Shinto     It's just something I'm not into 
There's no telling what WE'RE into!    Tho I guess I could begin to  
but that's good enough for me!         'Cause it's good enough for me! 
                                        
             In Japan they thought it neato
             When they worshipped Hirohito
             But that didn't sit with SEATO

Uncle Crowley was a dreamer      When the clouds they are a'rumbling    
At the Abbey of Thelemer         And the thunder is a'grumbling         
But his magic is a screamer,     Then it's Crowley that you're mumbling 
So it's good enough for me!      And it's good enough for me!        
                                           
There are those who follow Crowley     Let us call an Elemental       
Tho the stuff that he held holy        For a temporary rental            
Turn your your brain to guacamole      Just as long as it is gentle     
But he's good enough for me!           It is good enough for me!      
                                                                               
It was good enough for Crowley          
With his sacraments unholy              
Who smoked pot and ate some moly        
And it's good enough for me!

It was good enough for Granny           It's not good enough for Reagan   
She could throw a double-whammy         It's not good enough for Reagan

With the aid of my athame             Meeting at the Witching Hour    
I can throw a "double-whammy"         By the Bud, and Branch and Flower 
(And can slice and dice salami!)      Folks are raising up the Power 
So it's good enough for me!           And that's where I want to be! 
                                        
There will be a lot of lovin'       We will worship with the witches            
When we're meetin in our Coven      'Cause we're rowdy sons-of-bitches

Frolic in her swimming pool      I think Northwoods is behind it!

And do just like John Paul pleases    The Etruscan god of wine        
That we will... when Hades freezes!   This verse doesn't really rhyme

  I suppose that this last song has turned you into a newt by now.
  You may not realize that it happened, 'cause that's just how that
  sort of thing seems to work. You need to put a carrot on your nose
  and find a duck, and weigh it. Then you'll be OK again.

            THE HIGH HOLIDAY SONG
                             -Melusine
       (Tune "The Serving-Girl's Holiday")

        I've waited longing for today
        Spin the bobbin and spool away!
        In joy and bliss I'm off to play
        Upon this high holiday!

CHORUS: And spin the bobbin and spool away!
        Oh joy that it's a holiday!

        This night of (name) now we greet
        Hail my friends, and merry meet!
        Strike the harp; the drum we'll beat
        Upon this high holiday!

        The wine and cakes we've bought and made
        Found a spot in a moon-lit glade
        Our love and trust will never fade
        Especially on this holiday!

        In forst glade we've built a fire
        Symbol of our heart's desire

          Re: Labelling Wiccans
                  Hello. I'm the academic that Khaled mentioned. sigh... I've
          read the
          thread on definitions and I can see the trouble you have gotten into:
          prescriptive definition versus descriptive definition. Let me explain:
          I am currently working in the Dept of Religious Studies of the Univer-
          sity of Ottawa as a graduate student studying contemporary religious
          movements in Canada, especially women centered or women defined. This,
          by definition,includes Wicca/Witchcraft/Neo-Witchcraft/Neo-Pagan-
          ism/Women's Spirituality/Women's Urban(Neo) Shamanism...etc... I'm not
          the only one there involved in this research (we have an actual
          "Centre for Research in Women and Religion"). We also have a number of
          women (and one man) researching collateral aspects of the above
          mentioned religious phenomena. We have had to come to some working
          definitions so that we can talk to each other and to other religion-
          ists.

                  Personally, I have also had to come up with some minimal
          definition of Wicca/Witchcraft that I can use as a representative of
          said phenomena (yes, I am using the plural form) when I am asked to
          present/explain/ explicate said phenomena to forums such as the
          Canadian Council of Churches or the Canadian Association for Pastoral
          Education (CAPE). It is as a result of this need, that I have devel-
          oped a minimal inclusive descriptive definition that can be used to
          differentiate Wicca/Witchcraft from other religious phenomena.

                  What is a minimal inclusive descriptive definition you ask?
          Ok. Minimal = smallest number of characteristics Inclusive = includes
          rather than excludes Descriptive = what is actually there rather than
          what should be there (prescriptive) Definition = what can be used to
          define, ie. to draw a line around, to know relative to what is left
          undefined/unknown

                  I'm using a technique common in Anthropology: componential
          analysis, ie. the identification of discreet analytical features
          (components) that can be seen as occuring or not. A set of these which
          minimally defines something is seen as its descriptive paradigm. A
          descriptive paradigm is unique in that it can only be used to define
          the phenomenon it describes and no other. Ok? Just so you know what
          kind of language I'm using.

                  Yes, I consider myself 'Wiccan'. No, I am not a member/init-
          iate/follower of any specific 'tradition'. I'm too much of an anar-
          chist at heart for that, and anyways, how can I swear secrecy if my
          only stock in trade as an anthropologist is the knowledge I have
          gained by
          experience? Sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

                  Ok. So here goes....Relative to any other faith system,Wic-
          ca/Witchcraft (I won't seperate them yet) can be minimaly defined as
          consisting of these five necessary components:
          1) faith system is nature based
          2) divinity is conceived as inherent
          3) divinity is apprehended as gendered and as minimaly female 
          4) the locus of decision is the individual
          5) the locus of action is the individual in the present


                                                                            2333

                  What does this mean? Remember, this is to distinguish this
          faith group relative to any other type of faith group. It does NOT
          include variations, only COMMONALITIES.
          1) nature based: as far as I can tell, all forms of Wicca/Witchcraft
          (WW for short?) are based on humans being part of and in nature rather
          than apart from.  Also, seasonality and elements (air, earth, water,
          fire) are central to the human apprehension and interaction with
          nature.

          2) divinity is inherent: divinity has manifested in all that is, all
          that is is an aspect of divinity, we are all manifestations of divin-
          ity.....

          3) divinity gendered and female: divinity in one of its most apprehen-
          dable forms knows itself in the specificity of gender and that gender
          is at least female "The Goddess". All groups, whether they acknowledge
          the God or not,know divinity in its female form.

          4) locus of decision: morality is a personal, individual thing and
          responsibility for choices is also a personal, individual thing. No
          one can (successfully) impose a set morality on any one else. Ost-
          racism seems to be the only -effective- means of moral cohersion used
          by adherents to this faith. Its the other side of "Do what thou wilt,
          An it harm none" and the Law of Karma. If a person acts contrary to
          the community norm, this person will be shunned, ostracized, severely
          criticized, and may as a result,leave the community. No matter the
          behaviour which the community wishes to refuse to accept, the in-
          dividual will not be 'punished' or told that they may not continue to
          behave in their chosen way. Again, even community norms (and community
          may be read as 'tradition') cannot be imposed or dictated. Even in
          oath bound traditions, oaths are taken freely and as freely adhered to
          or broken.

          5) locus of action: nothing is differed to the 'ever after', nor is
          the past
          fully responsible for what occurs in the present. This is it, this is
          all there is for anyone, make the most of it. Again, no predestin-
          ation, no fatalism, no 'heaven' or 'hell', this is not a prelude.

                  Secondly, no congregation, no group, no church, no polity has
          any more importance and certainly far less immediacy than the in-
          dividual as the believer and the definer of what is believe. Faith is
          lived within the individual, as an individual.

                  Ok. Remember, this describes ONLY what all forms of WW share,
          NOT what deferentiates them from each other or what is defined within
          a tradition as what constitutes the whole of THEIR tradition. It is a
          minimal, inclusive, descriptive definition..... (part 2 follows)


                                                                            2334


                  Whew....So what use is this type of definition? It allows me
          to compare WW to other faiths such as Christianity, Shinto, Islam,
          etc. It allows me to talk about beliefs and practices without getting
          mired in the specificity of traditions. It also allows me to speak of
          Gardenarians and Dianics in the same breath. They have more in common
          relative to other faiths than they have different relative to each
          other...

                  I was asked what defined WW relative to other Pagans and to
          nature based faiths such as Shinto. It took some thinking but I think
          I've been able to do it:
          WW is
          1) focused on the human (rather than nature or divinity)
          2) divinity always takes a human form (at least)
          3) WW works according to principles (fundamental underlying realities  
           which inform behaviour)
          4) WW is law driven (there is a 'right' or 'proper' way...) 5) bel     
            ievers need to rationalize and to make scientific their faith (just  
            think of tables or correspondences and our explanations of 'why it   
           works')

                  I was also asked what distinction I made between Pagan, Wicca
          and Witchcraft. I do make a difference.

           Pagan: from paganus (latin) for of the country side as opposed to
          "civitas" of the city

          Neo-Pagan: post 196o's revival of country cum nature based spiritual-
          ity -seen in opposition to Christian/Mainstream church -logical
          spiritual outcome of the 'back to the land' and 'experiential
          experimentation/mystical quest' of this same era

          Witchcraft (revival): British phenomenon dating from the 1950's. Wicca
          is used in Gardenarian texts but not used as a lable of the faith
          group or practice. Wiccan NOT used.

          Wicca/Wiccan: preferred terms adopted by many North American developed
          Traditions of WW to differentiate themselves from British Traditions
          (Gardenarian, Alexandrian)

          Witch/Dianic: terms of self definition used by many North American
          women to acknowledge their mythopoethic/political reclaiming of woman
          centered / woman defined spirituality. Often expressed as: Women were
          burned as witches in the Middle Ages, well, I'm a witch and you're NOT
          going to burn me! May or may not express the adherence to a specific
          tradition (Reclaiming, Dianic (Z. Budapest), etc) but is always an
          indicator of woman centered / woman defined experience and self
          definition.

          Neo-Witchcraft: all forms of contemporary Anglo (ie of English lan-
          guage,not an ethnic or nationalistic lable) witchcraft to distinguish
          from Ancient, Middle Eastern, Midieval, or non-European forms

          Wicca versus Witchcraft: as it seems to be used by most people today.
          Wicca is a type of religion and witchcraft is a technology (ie spell
          crafting,craft of the wise, nature magic....)

          Iyyar: A Menopause Ritual
          Penina Adelman

          A time to keep and a time to cast away

          This month's ritual has been designed with an awareness of our moth-
          ers, grandmother, and great-grandmothers who were earlier inhibited---
          even in the community of Jewish women--from marking the cessation of
          menstruation, of derech nashim (the way of younger women as in Genesis
          31:35) and the release from the physical tasks of childbearing and
          childrearing. Now wholly freed, our female ancestors would have been
          ready "to give birth" to their personal creativity, to dip into
          Miriam's Well without the distractions and responsibilities of family.

          We hope to convey a positive tenor to this life cycle event which has
          been feared and misunderstood by so many men and women in the past.
          Once a woman has reached the age beyond which pregnancy ceases, her
          gender identity is often blurred by society. She is in a transitional
          state, experienced by those interacting with her as being full of
          power and danger. During the tumulous fourteenth century when the
          Black Death struck in Europe,those women who managed to survive the
          disease and live to old age were thought to be witches.

          In interviewing post-menopausal woman to arrive at an appropriate
          ritual marking their "change of life", I found unanimous reactions.
          All indicated they would forgo any ritual ceremony that emphasized
          menopause, fearing a societal backlash which might discriminate
          against them as they advanced in age. Most said they did not feel very
          different physically after menopause. The aging process itself was
          their emphasis; the gradual body changes. These were linked not only
          to menopause, but to the entire process of aging. Whether these same
          feelings and attitudes will persist when contemporary young women
          reach their menopause is now being speculated.

          Some women may choose to mark the end of menopause with a "mature age
          bat mitzvah" if they have never had one as an adolescent. Setting a
          goal such as learning to read and speak Hebrew, to read Torah, to lead
          a prayer service, teaching a Jewish text within the forum of a bat
          mitzvah, at an age well beyond 12 or 13, is the way many older women
          are choosing to reenter the tradition after years of alienation from,
          or passive appreciation of, Jewish ritual. Others may wish to invite
          friends who experience menopause already or are presently undergoing
          it. My own mother has said that she could not imagine participating in
          a menopause ritual, but would have liked to get together with her
          friends to share experiences of those important years of change.

          Hithbagut
          Bring: The book of Ruth (several copies); a group for the mithbogeret.
          (As preparation, read the Book of Ruth.) Setting: Home of the mith-
          bogeret, the menopausal or post-menopausal woman, here named Tamar. We
          are in a sitting room. Have pictures of the woman as a baby, young
          girl, young woman, bride, mother, grandmother. Flowers and greens of
          the season decorate the room.  Attending are all the female relatives
          of the mithbogeret who can be present--sisters, daughters, mother,
          aunts--as well as her good friends, including members of the Rosh
          Hodesh group.


                                                                            2336

          Themes of Iyyar
          Keeper: Iyyar is a transitional month which falls between two major
          holidays--Pesach, in the month of Nisan, and Shavuot, in Sivan. From
          the second night of Pesach, we count forty-nine days (seven weeks)
          until Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks. This period is called the Omer.
          When the Temple still stood in Jerusalem, each family would count a
          sheaf offering of grain to bring to the Temple on the pilgrimage
          festival of Shavuot. The purpose of this may have been partly a way of
          blessing the Spring harvest which would also be celebrated on Shavuot.
                   In the act of counting, the Rabbis saw an opportunity to keep
          track of inner harvest of spiritual qualities. Every week of the Omer
          was to emphasize a particular attribute of God. Each day of the week
          then represented a different permutation of the divine attributes.
                   In the context of this Rosh Hodesh Iyyar marking Tamar's
          hithbagrut, one may think of the counting of years and deeds and
          events which make up a woman's life. given are seven distinct stages
          of life corresponding to the seven weeks of Omer: conception, pregnan-
          cy, birth, childhood, womanhood, motherhood, and maturity.
                   In the seven-week counting of the Omer, we find the sugges-
          tion of seven ritual activities which may be performed during the Rosh
          Hodesh celebration for any given month. We take as our impetus the
          Rabbis' notion of seven divine attributes to be explored and emulated
          for the purpose of healing the ills of the universe. We have desig-
          nated these activities:
          meditation, ritual immersion, (mikveh), singing, prayer, storytelling
          (midrash), text study (talmud torah). eating and drinking.

          Omer as Period of Mourning
          Keeper of Iyyar: The period of the Omer which includes the entire
          month of
          Iyyar is considered by observant Jews to be a time of mourning.
          Wedding
          ceremonies, hair cutting, and playing music are prohibited. The
          reasons for this are unclear, ranging from a plague said to have
          killed the disciples of Rabbi Akiba in the early centuries of the
          Common Era, to the influence of a Roman superstition which held that
          during this time of year, the souls of the dead wander into the land
          of the living. We do not view menopause as a time to mourn the "end of
          fertility", as have many in the past. Our purpose in coming together
          today is, rather, to understand and recognize the meaning of menopause
          for women who have experienced it or will soon enter its phases. Today
          we have an opportunity to think of new ways for women to mark this
          time in future years.

          Sign of Iyyar
               Keeper of Iyyar: The astrological sign of the month is the Bull,
          Shor. Nisan is the month during which seeds are planted. The bull
          ploughs the earth, bending its broad neck to the ground, dragging a
          heavy load. The bull tends the change from the new Spring growth of
          Nisan to the first Spring harvest of Sivan. The rhythms of the earth
          reverberate throughtout the strong body of the bull.

          Kavannah
               Keeper of Iyyar: In some cultures, once a woman has passed the
          age of childbearing, she is known as the "Wise Woman" of the com-
          munity. In her reside the knowledge and values of her people which she
          transmits to the young. Hers is the status of a venerated elder. This
          contrasts sharply with the devalued status of the aging female in our
          own culture. Today we intend to question this and to learn about the
          experience all have had during menopause in order to instill new and


                                                                            2337

          positive expectations in our children and grandchildren. One of the
          major misconceptions we need to address has to do with sex and the
          older woman. In Judaism, sex has never been linked only to procrea-
          tion. On the contrary, in addition to procreation, sex exists for the
          sake of pleasure, wellbeing, and harmony in a marriage. Therefore,
          when a woman has passed the age of childbearing and even earlier, she
          is encouraged by Jewish law to enjoy sex with her partner. Are there
          any other kavannot? Each woman voices her own intention for the
          ritual.

          Woman: To mark the passing of physical fertility and to rededicate
          ourselves to a greater focus on spiritual, intellectual, and artistic
          creativity and fertility.

          Woman: To say good-bye to the womb, rechem, the center of childbear-
          ing.

          Woman: To praise and give thanks for the cycles of life which pulsate
          through our bodies.

          Woman: To say good-bye and good riddance to tampoons and sanitary
          napkins and pads and foams and jellies and diaphragms and pills and
          anything else I've left out--forever!

          Tamar, the Mithbogeret: I would like this to be a ritual of transmit-
          ting wisdom, hokhmah.

          In Greek, the word for "wisdom", sophia, was identified with a female
          figure.  In Hebrew hokhmah is a word of the feminine gender. The
          connection between wisdom of Tekoa and Abel in 11 Samuel 14 and 11
          Samuel 20, respectively, are examples of what seemed to be a conven-
          tion in Isreal at that time--a woman of the community who knew how to
          choose her words wisely and communicate the desired message. She was
          perhaps a female counterpart to the Hebrew prophet, God's instrument
          of communication with the people of Isreal. More examples are found in
          Proverbs 14:1 and in poem recited to the woman of the household on
          Sabbath evening, "A Woman of Valor." One of the last lines speaks of
          her mouth, which "opens with wisdom."

               In fairy tales, the woman with special powers, with the knowledge
          of creation and destruction, is either an evil witch or a good fairy
          godmother.  Both are frequently characterized as older women. In this
          hithbagrut ritual, we teach and lead a discussion based on two stories
          of mother and daughter figures where the mother passes on her life's
          wisdom to her daughter. they are stories of Naomi and Ruth in the
          Bible and Demeter and Persephone from Greek mythology.

          Storytelling
             All should have a copy of he story of Ruth and Naomi, or should
          have read the story in preparation. Tamar, the mithbogeret, then tells
          the Greek myth in her own words.

                                  Demeter and Persephone

          Once there lived a goddess who ruled over the earth. She had power
          over agriculture, causing aboundant growth of cereals and grains. In
          this way she echoed Naomi and Ruth, women of the land. Demeter had one
          lovely daughter, Persephone, as fair as the first flower of Spring.

          One day Persephone wandered far from her mother to pick flowers which


                                                                            2338

          beckoned. Steeped in the fragrance of those blooms, she was startled
          by Hades, the dark god of the Underworld. He seized her and pulled her
          down to his cold, damp kingdom beneath the earth.

          Demeter sank into despair when her beloved daughter did not return.
          She entered into mourning, forgetting to bring new buds into being.
          She grieved for her daughter, even refusing to eat or sleep. Thus, the
          earth was allowed to wither.

          When at last she sought aid from the gods to find her daughter, she
          was told that if Persephone had not eaten food in the Underworld, she
          could return unharmed to this world. Though Persephone had not been
          tempted by food, Hades was able to break her resolve with a single
          ruby seed of a pomegranite. Knowing that if he could induce her to
          nourish herself in his domain, he could have her as his wife, he
          strove to make her taste food. Because of that one seed, she would now
          have to divide her time equally between Hades and Demeter, between the
          land of darkness and death and the land of light and life.

          That is why the Greeks say that the earth blooms half  the year and
          withers during the other half. When Persephone descends to her hus-
          band,
          Hades, Demeter forgets to bring the buds into being.

          Tamar describes the link between these stories in which an older woamn
          passes down special knowledge to a younger woman, and the onset of
          menopause in which the transmission of wisdom amoung the members of a
          women's community is crucial. She tells  of her own experience of
          menopause and asks other women to share theirs. The younger women who
          are present share their fears and fantasies of menopause and ask
          questions of the older women.

          Meditation and Movement
              Woman: Since menopause involves a new relationship with one's
          body, we now meditate on ending that segment of our live characterized
          by an active womb.

              This meditation begins with a movement excercise called "Aura-
          Brushing." The "aura" is the psychic field arond an individual. This
          aura may be affected by fatigue, illness, depression, isolation. The
          purpose of "brushing the aura" is to symbolize making a fresh start by
          discarding the cobwebs which drain one of energy.

          We start by forming groups of threes, one woman standing in the
          middle, one on each side of her. Now the woman in the middle should
          close her eyes. the other two will begin to whisk the air upward from
          her feet as they whisper her name repeatedly. They whisk from her
          feet, her legs, her trunk, up to her neck and head, whispering all the
          while.

          Each woman in the group takes turns standing in the middle while the
          other two brush her "aura".

          Woman: I composed this meditation especially with you in mind. Tamar,
          as you and I have been working together, I know the kind of imagery
          you might use for yourself.

          It is important to note here that the process just mentioned is a
          crucial one for the Rosh Hodesh ritual. As pioneers in new ritual, we
          continu to scrutinize our conceptions to create meaningful ceremonies.


                                                                            2339

          In this case, Tamar asked for help in saying good-bye to her once-act-
          ive womb. another woman might require a different image journey.

          Woman: While we composed the following for Tamar, all may participate,
          even those not yet at menopause. But do not feel you must participate.
          You may wish to close your eyes sending healing energy to Tamar. Or,
          you may wish to start with this visualization and then let your own
          imagination take over. Some of you may want to leave the room. How you
          decide to participate is your own choice.

          Now, begin by finding a comfortable position. Close your eyes and
          focus on your breathing deeply in and out...

          See yourself carrying your womb in a crystal jar. Look at it care-
          fully. take the jar with you to Jerusalem. Carry it carefully up to
          the Mount of Olives.  Find a spot on the Mount of Olives and begin
          digging a hole with your hands.

          Dig deeply, and when the hole is deep enough, place the jar containing
          your womb deep into the Jerusalem earth. Cover the jar carefully. Know
          that your womb is buried safely, forever. Before leaving the spot
          where your womb is buried, thank your womb for all that it has given
          you. Thank the earth for protecting and housing your womb.

          Cover the spot with a smooth, white Jerusalem stone. Walk to a nearby
          waterfall. Stand beneath it and feel yourself cleased from within and
          without.  Retuen home knowing that you will continue to be creative
          and productive. Feel yourself strong and in perfect health.

          When you are ready open your eyes.

          When the mediatation is over, some of the women share what they felt.
          Others remain silent, choosing to listen. Tamar is very peaceful,
          talking about what this ritual evening has meant to her.

          Gift the women present Tamar, the mithbogeret, with a gift, one they
          have made or bought. The Keeper of Iyyar invites all to partake of the
          food and drink on the table.

                                         The Blot 
                           Copyright (C) 1991, 1992 Lewis Stead

          The Blot is the most common ritual within Asatru. In its simplest form
          a blot is making a  sacrifice to the Gods. In the old days this was
          done by feasting on an animal consecrated to the  Gods and then
          slaughtered. (The word blot itself is related to the Norse words for
          "blood" and "sacrifice.") As we are no longer farmers and our needs
          are simpler today, the most common blot  is an offering of mead or
          other alchoholic beverage to the deities.

          Many modern folk will be suspicious of a ritual such as this. Rituals
          such as the blot have been  falsely interpreted by post-Pagan sources
          in order to denegrate the ritual or trivialize it. The most  common
          myth about ritual sacrifice is that one is buying off a deity e.g. one
          throws a virgin into the Volcano so it won't erupt. Nothing could be
          further from the truth. In Asatru it is believed  that we are not only
          the worshippers of the Gods but that we are physically related to
          them. The  Eddas tell of a God, Rig, who went to various farmsteads
          and fathered the human race so we are  physically kin to the Gods. On
          a more esoteric level, humankind is gifted with "ond" or the gift  of
          ecstasy. Ond is a force that is of the Gods. It is everything that
          makes humans different from  the other creatures of the world. As
          creatures with this gift, we are immediately connected to the  Gods,
          we are part of their tribe, their kin. Thus we are not simply buying
          off the Gods by offering  them something that they want, but we are
          sharing with the Gods something that we all take joy  in. Sharing and
          gift giving was an incredibly important part of Norse cultur (and of
          most ancient  cultures) and had magical significance. Giving a gift
          was a sign of friendship, kinship, and  connection. By sharing a blot
          with the Gods we reaffirm our connection to them and thus  reawaken
          their powers within us and their watchfullness over our world.

          A blot can be a simple affair where a horn of mead is consecrated to
          the Gods and then poured as  a libation, or it can be a part of a
          larger ritual.  A good comparison is the Catholic Mass which  may be
          part of a regular service or special event such as a wedding or
          funeral, or it may be done  as a purely magical-religious practice
          without any sermon, hymns, or other trappings.

          The blot consists of three parts, the hallowing or consecrating of the
          offering, the sharing of the  offering, and the libation. Each of
          these is equally important. The only tools required are mead,  beer or
          juice, a horn or chalice, a sprig of evergreen used to sprinkle the
          mead, and a ceremonial  bowl known as a Hlautbowl into which the
          initial libation will be made.

          The blot begins with the consecration of the offering. The Gothi
          (Priest) or Gythia (Priestess)  officiating at the blot invokes the
          God or Goddess being honored. This is usually accomplished  by a
          spoken declaration with ones arms being held above ones head in a Y
          shape, in imitation of  the rune elhaz. This posture is used for most
          invocations and prayers throughout Asatru. After  the spoken invoc-
          ation an appropriate rune or other symbol of the God or Goddess may be
          drawn  in the air with the finger or with the staff. Once the God is
          invoked, the Gothi takes up the horn.  His assistant pours mead from
          the bottle into the horn. The Gothi then traces the hammer sign  (an
          upside down T) over the horn as a blessing and holds it above his
          head offering it to the  Gods. He then speaks a request that the God
          or Goddess bless the offering and accept it as a  sacrifice. At the


                                                                            2341

          least one will feel the presence of the deity; at best one will be
          able to feel in some inner way the God taking of the mead and drinking
          it.

          The mead is now not only blessed with divine power but has passed the
          lips of the God or  Goddess. The Gothi then takes a drink of the horn
          and it is passed around the gathered folk.  Although it sounds like a
          very simple thing, it can be a very powerful experience. At this point 
          the mead is no longer simply a drink but is imbued with the blessing
          and power of the God or  Goddess being honored. When one drinks, one
          is taking that power into onesself. After the horn  has made the
          rounds once, the Gothi again drinks from the horn and then empties the
          remainder  into the hlautbowl. The Gothi then takes up the evergreen
          sprig and his assistant the hlautbowl  and the Gothi sprinkles the
          mead around the circle or temple or onto the altar. If there are a
          great  number of the folk gathered, one may wish to drop the drinking
          and merely sprinkle the various  folk with the mead as a way of
          sharing it. In a small group one might merely drink as the  blessing.

          When this is done the Hlautbowl is taken by the Gothi and poured out
          onto the ground. This is  done as an offering not only to the God
          invoked at the blot, but it is also traditional to remember  the Earth
          Mother at this time, since it is being poured onto her ground. Many
          invocations  mention the God, Goddess, or spirit being sacrificed to,
          and then Mother Earth, as in the Sigrdrifa Prayer "Hail to the Gods
          and to the Goddesses as well; Hail Earth that gives to all  men."
          (Sigrdrifumal 3) With this action, the blot is ended.

          Obviously this is a very sparse ritual and if performed alone could be
          completed in only a few  minutes. This is as it should be, for blots
          are often poured not because it is a time of gathering or  festivity
          for the folk, but because the blot must be poured in honor or petition
          of a God or Goddess on their holiday or some other important occasion.
          For example, a father tending his  sick child might pour a blot to Eir
          the Goddess of healing. Obviously he doesn't have time to  waste on
          the "trappings" of ritual. The intent is to make an offering to the
          Goddess as quickly as possible. At some times a full celebration might
          not be made of a holiday because of a persons  hectic schedule, but at
          the least a blot should be made to mark the occasion. However, in most 
          cases a blot will at least be accompanied by a statement of intent at
          the beginning and some sort  of conclusion at the end. It might also
          be interspersed with or done at the conclusion of ritual  theater or
          magic. Our kindred, for example, begins the ritual with a chant of
          "Odin, Vili, Ve"  which connects us to the Gods of creation. Between
          the invocation of the God or Goddess and  the actual Blot we usually
          add a meditation or something else which acts as a focus of the
          ritual.  Once, for example, we made mead in the middle of a ritual to
          Aegir. As part of our blot we also  pass the horn three times. The
          first time around is a taking in of the power of the charged mead  and
          all offer a toast to the God(s) of the occasion. The second and third
          rounds are open to toasts  to other Gods, toasts to the kindred, the
          hosts, to pledges, boasting and anything else on wishes to  say. It is
          essentially a "mini sumble" in the middle of our blot. Always of
          course, we remember  the purpose of our ritual. We would never toast
          one of the Jotnar during a ritual to Thor for  example. We have also
          added a few steps at the end which are a private affirmation of our
          groups  kinship with each other and with the Gods.

                         THE NECKLACE OF A THOUSAND STRANDS

          In the beginning that ever was and ever shall be, there was only
          Night.  She lay sleeping.  In Her sleeping, She dreamed.  In Her
          dreaming, She sighed.  In Her sighing, She turned and in Her
          turning, She awakened.  In Her awakening, She saw naught but
          Herself, and found Herself beautiful.

          Long did She delight in Her beauty, Her perfection.  Her softly
          rounded limbs, full body and flowing hair were so magnificent
          that She wished to adorn Herself.

          She captured Her thoughts, each a brilliantly colored speck of
          light, and strung them together to form a Necklace of a Thousand
          Strands.  This She donned and was pleased.

          Each speck sparkled with its own hue and brilliance, creating
          spectacular scenes of Night in Her many attitudes and postures. 
          When Night moved, so did the Necklace of a Thousand Strands. 
          This created a living, moving mosaic of Night - each image acting
          and reacting with other images of Herself.

          Though this was beautiful and pleasing to Night, it created in
          Her a loneliness.  Loneliness to have companionship, loneliness
          to have another admire Her great beauty, loneliness to experience
          love outside Herself.

          Not know how to create this Other that She longed for, She sought
          to amuse Herself through movement.  She began a stately dance,
          slow and measured.  As She turned in the figures of the Dance,
          wind was created in Her passing, and in it She visualized a
          partner, a counterpart.

          She sent all Her love and longing into the whirlwind She had
          created, and a shadowy form began to take shape.  She turned and
          spun ever faster, thinking more upon the shape of Her desire.

          The form became more solid.  It began to take on substance and
          reality.  It was like, yet unlike, Night.  She felt drawn to it
          and it was impelled toward Her.

          She gloried in Her creation of the form, and it adored Her great
          beauty.  The Two danced together.  The longer They danced, the
          stronger and brighter did the fierce spirit of longs and love
          grow between Them, Night and Her Shadow.

          Her Shadow became all that Night was not, out of Her longing to
          be fulfilled, and She was called Day.

          Day and Night danced furiously together, and finally, no longer
          able to keep apart, made love to one another. In Their wild,


                                                                            2343

          passionate turnings, the Necklace of a Thousand Strands began to
          break, a strand at a time.  The specks of light went flying off
          to become the Stars, to swim about the divine couple, in
          beautiful precise patterns, as if to remain a part of Love's
          Dance.  Thus began the Ages of Loving.

          All but one strand broke, and it remains together to this day. 
          It is seen in the sky, brilliant, breath-taking and
          awe-inspiring.  We call it the Milky Way.

          Dawn and Dusk are the sacred times and places where Night and Day
          merge in love's ecstasy.  Keep them holy.

                        HOW THE WORLDS AND PEOPLES CAME TO BE

          Night and Day danced lovingly and long, through the spectacular,
          blazing bits of thought that had flown away by the breaking of
          the Necklace.  Not long can such love exist with creating of
          Itself images that reflect this Great Love.

          Many of the bits of brilliance grew heavier and more solid
          throughout of passing of the Ages of Loving.  These bits were
          called Worlds, or Planets.

          The Lady and the Lord, Her Consort, looked upon their Worlds,
          delighting in each one, and decreed that there should be life
          upon them.  Life that re-created the Love and Harmony that They
          and the Universe shared.

          So, They began to form upon these Worlds, rivers and streams and
          bodies of water to quench the thirst of the plants and animals
          that would henceforth live upon the nurturing breasts of these
          Worlds.

          These Worlds They called "Little Mothers," for from their soil
          would spring all manner of life and it would be sustained by the
          "Little Mothers."

          Near each of the "Little Mothers" there was always placed a
          particularly bright thought-speck, called the "little Fathers." 
          For Night and Day knew, as we do, that Life must have warmth and
          light to truly grow and reproduce.

          All Worlds They did not make the same, for diversity and
          combination serve to further the Great Love of Themselves.

          Having then seen to the Planets and Suns, and too, to the seeding
          of the Worlds with all manner of vegetable and animal life, the
          Divine Ones rested.

          But the Great Goddess was not content.  She felt the work was yet
          unfinished.  She spoke to Her Consort and told Him of a plan.  He
          agreed, knowing that the Lady knew what was best for Her
          Creations - for was She not the Progenitor of All?

          Thus, they began to make and mold a people for a World.  They
          made them in twos, male and female, to reflect the images of
          Themselves, and so that the re-enactment of Their Great Love


                                                                            2344

          might take place.

          Now we know what people transpired upon this World, but we, as
          yet, know not what people were designed to populate other Worlds,
          or which Stars they are under by which they flourish by the Lady.

          Though we would wish in our hearts to be the only objects of
          reflection of their Love, we must never think to believe that
          Their Infinite Love, burgeoning across all the Universe, had
          created none but Ourselves.  Nor that the Divine Ones are so
          limited that They have not created many peoples on many Worlds,
          though unbeknownst to us.  And they - these people of other
          Planets, like us, are perfect reflections of that immense, Divine
          Never-ending Love.

                                  LIGHT OF THE WOMB

          In the warm Womb of Her Mother, She rested and dreamed.  She felt
          through the membrane all that had passed, did pass, and would
          pass with Her Mother.  She knew that Her Mother was reckoned to
          be beautiful, kind and giving; yet too, She know that those Her
          Mother would succor had no thought of her Gifts, and would not
          repay kindness with kindness, but rather with rapine and
          disregard.

          Light-of-the-Womb knew that She had been seeing future dreams;
          that the ugliness and cruelty of Her Mother's foster-children was
          yet to come.  And so, She resolved in Her heart to become
          beautiful but uncaring to those who would grasp at her beauty -
          unreachable, yet so desirable that Her Mother's foster-children
          would ache in their hearts for desire of Her.

          The day of Her birthing came, and as Her Mother shuddered in the
          agonies of labor, Light-of-the-Womb cared not for Her own pains,
          nor for those of Her Mother - but thought only of Her imminent
          freedom that would at last allow Her revenge on
          those-yet-to-come.

          With a heaving surge, She tore free from Her Mother's thrashing
          body, and screamed in triumph at Her escape.

          Now even as the Daughter knew of all that passed with the Mother,
          so did the Mother know of that which passed within the heart and
          mind of the Daughter; and She set up a great travail.  The waters
          of Her Womb crashed and hissed in torment; Her bones creaked and
          trembled; Her flesh rent apart in pain and suffering.

          Yet in Her great Agony, the Mother cried out to Her Child, "Oh,
          Daughter!  Light-of-My-Womb!  Why do you betray your Heritage?" 
          And in coldness, did the Daughter answer, "I would not be as You,
          Mother, to be ravaged by the uncaring; to be ignored by the
          lesser who have no sense of what they do; who see not beauty in
          its truest form!"

          And She placed Herself a distance from Her Mother; away from the
          warmth of Her embrace - yet within the reach of Her low, gentle
          voice.

          Long ages passed, and the uncaring Child danced Her empty dance
          about the abode of Her Mother, growing more delighted with Her


                                                                            2345

          own frozen beauty; more strongly determined to exact revenge upon
          those who would bring pain and sorrow and disgrace upon Her
          Mother.  Her light of beauty shone silvery and pristine upon Her
          Mother's sleeping form.

          When the fosterlings came, at first they were reverent, and gave
          back to the Mother tokens of esteem and praise - all that they
          could with their limited abilities.  Though Light-of-the-Womb saw
          this, She waited - unforgiving of the future grief She knew they
          would bring.

          Always did the fosterlings worship Light-of-the-Womb, and She fed
          upon this worship as Her due, but did not soften towards them. 
          Some of Her coldness touched the fosterlings and made them, too,
          a bit cold.  But She cared not.

          In truth, She became more cold and disdainful, at times even
          bringing madness to those who cared too deeply for Her.  It was
          right and correct that they should worship Her beautiful Self,
          for was She not delicate and gracious in Her gift of Silver Light
          as Her Mother slept?  Did not She cause Her mother's Love for Her
          to control the planting and growing of the food they ate?  She,
          did She not, caused Her Mother's blood, Her salty Womb to pulse
          in rhythm to Her turning dance.

          She ignored Her Father's brilliance, though She privately
          admitted that it was from Him She had inherited her gentle glow. 
          At time, His anger flared at Her, then would Her gentle Mother
          intercede, coming between the Two, as if to protect the Daughter
          from His furious gaze.  At these times, a bitter cold came upon
          Light-of-the-Womb, and Her cruel humor turned to dark despair. 
          As soon as Her Father's wrath had cooled, Her mother would move
          gently away, exposing Light-of-the-Womb slowly to Her Father's
          gaze, so that He might remember the beauty of His Daughter.

          Light-of-the-Womb began after a time to feel shame, and regularly
          turned Her face from Her Parents - so that at times only a sliver
          of Her shining countenance could be seen.  Though She suffered
          shame at her disdainful ways, She found She could not change. 
          For all heat in Her had died over the long ages, and no more was
          there the white hot rushing of blood in her veins.  She had
          become stone - trapped by her own frozen vanity.

          So now, as She looks upon those fosterlings that tear at Her
          Mother's pride and beauty, She cannot aid Her in any way, save to
          soothe Her Mother with Her silvery light, and to cause desire in
          the fosterlings' hearts.  Her beauty and unapproachability tugs
          at their hearts, causing their bodies' water to flow in Her
          timeless rhythms - making them turn a portion of their desire for
          Her upon their fellow fosterlings.  Lovers, too, pray to Her and
          are heard.  The mad are sacred to Her, known as Moon-calves.

          Upon Her full face can be seen a look of surprised sadness, for
          She cannot partake of Her Mother's Fate, save to watch - and know
          that She, too, will be ravaged.  But since She never gave of
          warmth and substance, there will never be regret in the stripping
          of Her bones.  And only a cold, frozen thought is lodged in Her
          heart, remembering what love was.

          No tears fall from Her eyes, for Her waters are wasted, and Her


                                                                            2346

          blood is dried up; but a little remains of Her liquids; enough to
          warn the wise when rain will come.  At these times She dons a
          halo of opalescent light to show the only She can, that She is
          still the daughter of Her Parents and that though She cannot feel
          love or give love, She can inspire that emotion in Her Mother's
          fosterlings when they gaze up at Her and call Her - Moon.

                             HOW THE SEASONS CAME TO BE

          In the beginning of the green World, the Lady Night did dance
          upon the Earth's breast.  She delighted in all the Earth - the
          growing herbs, the animals, the insects, the birds of the air,
          the creatures of the waters, and all that made up this pleasant
          abode.

          She exulted in the warmth of the sunny days and cool nights.  She
          ruled this world with Her companion and counterpart, the Bright
          King, whom She had fashioned out of Her longing for love.  His
          name was Day; the brightness of the Sun shone from His visage. 
          Great was their joy in one another, and in the green fertile
          World about Them.

          The Earth became more and more full of Her creations - crowding
          happily in on one another, until there was little room to Dance
          or move about, and the Earth groaned under Life's weight.

          Mother Earth complained to Father sun, the They consulted with
          each other on how they might best serve the Great Goddess, and at
          the same time relieve the burden that rested so heavily on
          Earth's weary body.

          After much talking, they could not decide what they must do, and
          Father Sun told Mother Earth that since her's was the pain, so
          must Her's be the solution.  And He turned away His Face and
          shrouded Himself in robes of seething clouds.

          Coldness fell upon the Earth, and many things cried out in loss
          an pain.  For was not the Sun needful to them for Life?  Many
          things began to wilt and shrivel close to the Little Mother's
          bosom, looking for solace.  Many things burrowed deep, sleeping
          until a more favorable time.

          Then Mother Earth devised a plan - let there be two halves to the
          year - the bright and warm, and the dark and cold.  Thus would
          the burden lighten somewhat, when the things shriveled for a
          while.

          Father Sun once again looked upon Mother Earth, and agreed that
          Her plan might work well.  "But who would rule the dark time?" He
          asked.

          "Let the Lord be the Master of the cold season, " She replied. 
          "Then can the Lady renew and replenish all things after His
          Reign."

          Father Sun felt it would not be wise to leave the Lady
          companionless.  Why could there not be two - one to rule the
          bright and one to rule the dark.  He wished that the Bright Lord
          should remain in the warm time; for He was straight of limb,
          bright of visage, and merry of heart.  Too, Father Sun thought


                                                                            2347

          the Lady would wish a companion to compliment Her beauty, be
          light-hearted in all ways, thus making the task of renewing all
          the more joyous.

          Mother Earth thought long on this, and at last sent a choice of
          her own.  The man was strong and dark of countenance.  He had not
          the great beauty of Father Sun's choice, nor were His ways
          light-hearted and merry.  He was much given to thinking, planning
          and building.  He was much given to practicalities, and could be
          counted upon to the clearing away of the extra weight that so
          burdened Mother Earth.

          On a day designated by Sun and Earth, the two Lords met in a
          glade where the Lady sat twining ropes of flowers in her tresses,
          and draping them about Her body.  As She surveyed the two Lords,
          She felt chill from the Dark One.  He seemed so stern and
          forbidding!  The Bright One caused Her heart to dance.  She ran
          gaily off, holding the hand of the Bright Lord, singing and
          laughing.

          The Dark One said nothing.  He went far to the North, where the
          sun's rays were weaker, and the vegetation sparser.  He built
          Himself a fortress, and hunted for foods, preparing them in
          strange ways so that they would last a long while.  These, He
          stored, and then set about making furniture and pots of fired
          clay in which to cook.  After a time, He had made a snug and
          comfortable home for Himself, with room enough for guests.

          The Lady and Bright Lord payed Him no mind, gaily Dancing and
          playing and loving.  They planted seeds, tended them lovingly,
          and then at the fruits of Their Harvest.

          On the day the Sun stood still in His journey, the frolicking
          Lady and Lord felt a sudden chill.  There, in the meadow, where
          first the Three had met, stood the Dark One.  He held out His
          hand to invite the Maiden Lady to come with Him.

          The Bright Lord sheltered the Maiden in His arms, refusing to let
          her go, clinging with all the love of Life that was His nature. 
          The Lady held close to the Bright King, refusing to look upon the
          Other.

          "Then," said that Dark Other.  "We fight!"  They took up arms
          against One Another, and it seemed as if the Bright King was
          winning for a time.  The Maiden Lady clapped Her hands in glee.

          The Sun and Earth watched this battle passively; it seemed to go
          on forever.  But the sun must not stay His course in the Sky,and
          as sunset approached, the strength of the Bright King waned.  The
          Dark Lord, He of the Earth's devising, seemed neither to lose or
          gain strength, but remained constant.  He struck a great blow
          against the Bright King, who fell down, dying.  The golden grain
          drooped heavy heads, and the fruits of the trees fell to the
          ground in sorrow.  The flowers began to wither, though new ones
          sprang up, blood red from the Life fluids of the dying God.

          The Lady gave out a sorrowful cry, and the tree leaves changed
          their colors - some golden in honor of the Bright King's hair,
          some as red as His blood, and others the color of the Earth that
          was to receive Him into Her bosom.


                                                                            2348

          The Lady heaped flowers upon the still form of the Bright King,
          and mourned Him in a sorrowful song; a song that raced through
          the branches of the trees, who added their own mournful tones.

          Though the blood of the Bright King cried out for revenge, the
          Dark Lord ignored it, and grasping the Lady firmly by the hand,
          took Her off to His home in the North.

          The fallen fruits and flowers dissolved in sorrow, into the Earth
          Mother's breast.  The seeds of their yearning for Life lay
          dreaming of the long summer they had known; remembering the
          shining love that the Lady and Her Consort had shared with all
          that was.

          Now Father sun was angry that Mother Earth's choice should win
          over His Bright King in battle, and took Himself off a ways from
          Her.  The World became colder.  Without the love of the Maiden,
          the Brightness of the youth, and the warmth of Father Sun, Earth
          began to sleep under a blanket of white.  So, too, slept all but
          the most hardy of plants, trees, and animals.

          Though the Maiden resisted Him at first, She soon came to love
          the Dark One for His differences, and She learned much from Him,
          and He from Her.

          Then one day, the Sun stood quite still, viewing the Earth,
          thinking how still and pale She looked - and how it was not Her
          fault that her Champion had won.  He sent a pale ray of light
          down into the Caven Fortress where the Dark One ruled as Lord,
          the Lady by His side.  And lo, a son was born to Them.  His
          visage was bright and shining, as He laughed and played in His
          cradle.

          For a time, the Dark One was jealous of the Child, for He knew it
          was the Bright One, returned.  Then, as the Child grew to
          manhood, the Dark King sent Him away.

          The Lady, refreshed from Her confinement, followed the Youth. 
          Again, Spring came to the World.

          Now, this story is many times repeated.  Neither the Bright King
          or the Dark One ever own the Maiden-Lady for all time, but must
          share Her.  This must be, so the World be a true World, that the
          Four Seasons go apace to turn the wheel of the Year, and that all
          may learn that Life and Death and Life are but a cycle, and that
          Hope is always near.

                                THE REASON FOR DEATH

          A time after the Lady began Her yearly trip through the Seasons,
          sharing Her reign first with the Bright King, then the Dark King,
          She began to notice that when She returned to the Upper World,
          many of the things She loved had perished.  She spent much time
          replenishing the Earth with new plants and animals.  This work
          was joyous - as the creation of New Life is always joyous - but
          She puzzled over it.

          She inquired of her Companion, the Bright King, but He had no
          knowledge of what was happening to those things that had
          perished. He slyly suggested that when next She traveled to the


                                                                            2349

          Dark Lands to rule with the Dark King, to ask Him - the Dark One
          and Rival to the Bright King - the question that haunted Her so. 
          "Perhaps," said the Bright One, "It is some mischief that He, the
          Dark One, has gotten up to.  Then you shall have an answer."

          Thus, during Her next time with the Dark Lord, She inquired into
          the matter.  He answered, saying, "Yes, 'tis I."  Angered, She
          demanded to know why all the things She loved must wither and
          perish away at His command - for was not the growing and care of
          all things Her own right?

          He told Her that Death was the rest and release for all things. 
          That all things must wither and pass away for a time, to make
          room for new things - New Life.  He explained that mortals and
          animals and plants,not being of the fine, high, spiritual stuff
          as Themselves, were unable to sustain the fullness of Life for a
          long while - that they grew weary and longed for peace.

          She became anguished at the thought of the pains of her
          creations, and wished to know for Herself how they fared in their
          short lives.  The Dark King bade her go into a mortal body for
          its normal span to learn of sorrow, pain, age,and the longing for
          release.

          So She did go into the mortal body of a woman-seed in the womb of
          one of Her people.  she was born in great travail, suffered all
          the pangs of growing up, and then She began to age.  The mortal
          years passed through Her as days, and yet it was hard and
          wearisome.  Pains beset her, her joints grew stiff, Her eyes dim,
          and Her mind uncertain.  The many wisdoms She had gained, She
          spun as tales for little children sprawled by the hearth-fire on
          bitter Winter days.  she knew that though they listened now, they
          would forget all She had told,and have to learn and re-learn it
          all in their own time.  Sadness fell upon the Goddess.

          At last, troubled greatly by Her body's infirmities, She begged
          the Lord's release from the body that encompassed her spirit. 
          The Dark Lord, Ruler of Death, closed Her eyes with a gentle,
          loving hand, and lifted Her forth.  Her bright, shining presence
          was once again strong and beautiful.

          The Lady's tears fell golden to the ground, capturing an insect,
          a flower - and froze there, in the cold light of Her
          understanding.  These tears are found by mortals even today, and
          prized as gems. Not all have forgotten the beauty of the meaning
          of those golden teardrops.

          She turned to the Dark Lord, smiling.  She said, "I knew not that
          I knew not, but You have shown Me that peace, and rest and
          renewal are the rewards Death gives at the end of a hard and
          treacherous life.  How sad it is that these mortals know nothing
          of Our Glory, save at the end of physical existence."  He
          replied, "Lady, it is Law; whatever You have brought into
          existence never truly ceases to exist, but merely is changed into
          something new."

          She pondered long on this, and then turned to the Dark Lord and
          said, "Therefore, let Us give them the ecstasy of Love for one
          another, that they may touch upon this great beauty while on
          Earth.  Let it be the hope that spurs them on, though life seems


                                                                            2350

          hard at times.  And let them remember and love one another again,
          when they have returned to physical form."  "So be it," said He.

          The Lady gathered up Her frozen tears, and strung them together
          with pieces of jet, taken from the Dark Lord's Hall.  this
          necklace was to remind Her always of the intervals of Life and
          Death of all things.

          The Lord kissed her hand twice, and watched Her walk away to
          green the Earth once more, resplendent in Her new understanding
          of Life, Love and Death.

                          KARMA:  THE WHEEL AND THE SPIRAL

          The Lady of the Wheel of the Year, having learned that Death was
          a necessary part of Life, returned to her Bright King, and
          together they Danced with great joy, greening the Earth - so that
          all was again covered in blossoming, bursting Life.  From time to
          time, She would see one of Her People in sorrow and travail, and
          She would remember that existence.  She felt a pang of sorrow,
          recalling the despair at pain and trouble that mortals felt all
          through their lives.

          Only in the midst of Love or at the end of physical existence did
          they know bliss.  Too often, even the bliss of Love was forgotten
          in the throes of hardship and misery.  Too, She realized, that
          though there was rest and succor at the end of physical
          existence, the mortals knew no hope for betterment, other than
          peace at Life's end.

          At first, She did not speak of this to either the Bright Kin or
          the Dark Lord.  She pondered privately upon the cycle of Life,
          Death, and Rebirth; the Seasons of the wheel of the year, and at
          last made a decision.  Conferring first with One then the Other,
          the Lady persuaded her two Lords to consider a plan to help Her
          people.  That They might more readily accept Her plan, She
          presented it as a game.

          This game, She called Karma:  it was an elaborate system of
          debits and credits by which the players could judge the progress
          of the playing pieces - the pieces being the People.  Now, the
          actual living on Earth was only part of the game - the first
          stage - to be clever enough to survive danger, disease,hunger and
          other pieces maneuvering for the same.  the second stage was how
          well the pieces maneuvered for the prizes - and how honorable
          they went about achieving their goals (a credit), and how
          dishonorably they chose to act (a debit).

          Adding a further twist to the game, She insisted that when a
          piece had achieved the full round of the twelve-spoked wheel -
          having experienced and mastered the lessons of each spoke and
          returned a final time to the hub (known as the Summerland), that
          a third level be added.  this third level, being on of the
          Spirit, gave the pieces a chance to grasp from a Higher Existence
          than that of merely bettering the Physical Self.

          To expedite the counting up of credits and debits for each piece,
          She created a body of beings known as the Lords of Karma.  She
          set before Them the cosmic Laws of Order and Existence, and gave
          into Their keeping the Akashic Records - the golden, flowing


                                                                            2351

          source of all that is, was, and ever shall be.

          Then She instructed the Two Lords in the Game, that They might
          watch with interest and understanding.  Too, that They might
          cheer on or aid a piece that caught Their fancy or touch Their
          hearts with its struggles.  They, nor the Lords of Karma were
          judged - for it is only by the Cosmic Laws of Order and Existence
          in the Providence of the Divine One to judge the Creations.

          As the Game advanced, much to the enjoyment of the observers,
          there seemed to be a missing element.  the Dark Lord too the Lady
          aside and said, "Never meaning criticism, My Dearest Lady of
          Life, but is it not pointless if Your piece do not know they can
          strive toward better lives and higher aims?"  The Lady thought
          upon this, and told the Lord that He was correct, and that She,
          herself, must resolve this flaw in the pattern.

          She gave a banquet and invited all those of the Greater and
          Lessor Pantheons, explaining to them the Game, and the reason She
          must prepare for a Journey - Journey which would take Her once
          again into the World of Mortals.

          All the Beings of Light were grieved, for They love the Lady
          fully, and did not like her to be absent from Them.  but She
          promised Them that though She must journey far, as long as Love
          was, there was She, also.  She then departed on Her Journey to
          the Plane of Mortal Existence and was not seen again for a Tim in
          the Halls of Light and Love.

                                THE CRAFT OF THE WISE

          Now the Lady made Her journey to the Plane of Mortal Existence,
          and on the way, She passed through many other realms:  Those of
          spirits and phantasms, and those of the elements.  She dwelt a
          time in each realm, gathering the essences of each one about Her,
          layer upon layer, to clothe Herself.  These essences were
          necessary, for the Plane of Mortal Existence is made up of all of
          these elements, seen and unseen.

          Too, She spent time with Light-of-the-Womb, experiencing Her
          quiet pain, her self-imposed penance.  The Great Goddess reminded
          her Little Sister, Moon, that all things work together in
          Harmony, and that one day, Her great sacrifice would be repaid in
          Great Glory.

          Then coming at last to her destination, the Goddess once again
          clothed herself in Human Flesh.  She clothed Herself in all the
          pain and sorrow, and the joy that is the Fate of Humankind.  Back
          She went - back to the sensations of the five senses.  Back to
          the heavy physical vehicle that Human souls use to transport
          themselves about.  Back to a coarse and humble life; one from
          which She could study her people more fully, and teach them that
          which they must know.

          She chose not to go back into the body of a strong warrior, nor
          yet on of great physical feminine beauty - but rather as a plain,
          slender young woman.  Her eyes were brown as the Earth in which
          She dug for roots; Her hair was as brown as the bark; Her skin
          weathered a bit by the elements.  though She dressed as drabbly
          as any other mortal girl, there was still a spark, an intensity


                                                                            2352

          that could not be denied.  this, the Goddess Herself, could not
          change, for otherwise, She would not be present.

          The sparkle of Divinity that shone from Her eyes drew others to
          Her in a warm bond.  they listened to Her teach the secrets of
          planting and growing things, the ways of animals and fish and
          fowl; the flying birds and insects; secrets of water, wind and
          dire.

          Too, She instructed them in the Way.  She taught them of the
          Spiral Dance of the Universe, that same spiral that is found in
          the very cells of their bodies.  She instructed them in the
          Mysteries - those of Birth, and Death, and Rebirth; and in doing
          so, explained the Game of Karma.

          When She taught them all they could learn, She told them that She
          must go once again to her Halls of Love and Light, but that they
          might call upon Her in times of need, and She would hear and
          answer.  She told them that the phases of the Moon would show the
          Way.

          Among them She left One whom She had taken as a Consort and
          Helper.  He was a Forest Lord, Protector of the Wilds; He would
          as as Her Regent upon the Earth while She was away.

          The people wept bitterly, for they could not bear to be without
          their beloved Goddess.  But the Lord comforted them, saying,
          "Does She not love you enough to come amongst you? To provide a
          Regent for your comfort - to promise you an Eternal Life in Her
          Love at the end of the Spiral Dance?"

          And they built many temples and places of worship.  Sacred were
          the many Springs where She had drunk.  Sacred, too, were the many
          Groves where She had slept.  And too, those places of power where
          She had wrought the Magicks of the Spiral Dance for the
          edification and delight of Her children.

          Those She taught well became Her Priests and Priestesses - and
          they continue to instruct Her People in Her Ways.


                                                                            2353

                                      Celtic Deities? 

          Here is the promised beginning discussion of "The Gods" in
          Celtic religion.  The majority of this post is brought to you by
          Lorax, Small Furry Tree-Creature of the Gods <g>

                                 ****Extra-Long Posts Warning****

          I shall throw out the first hot caber by suggesting that use of the
          term
          "Gods" within a Pagan Celtic context is totally useless, mislead-
          ing,and an example of the sloppy scholarship that Deartha'ir Isaac
          bemoans.

          This notion has been long in coming for me, but was triggered this
          week when an ADF member noted the use of the word "God" [singular]
          several hundred times in a suggested reference work on pre-Christian
          Greek religion.  It made her somewhat nervous as it seemed to not be
          the best possible term in a polytheistic culture, given that a multi-
          tude of things, from entities to abstract concepts had been subsumed
          as "God".

          This, combined with my very recent reading of the Dunnaire Finn, the
          Book of Invasions, and the Tain has led me to be more discriminating.

          As my Priestess colleage, Brandy Williams, has often said, there are 2
          kinds of people: Splitters, and people who deny the existence of
          splitters. <g>

          So, let us take it from the very top, the creation of the world. At
          least, according to one translation of one version of the Book of
          Invasions.

          The first inhabitants of Ireland were Cesair, daughter of Bith, son of
          Noe (Noah), and their 3 men + 50 women.  <Happy happy, joy joy!> 
          These people all drowned, and are therefore unimportant to this story,
          save that Fintan survived to recount tales of the beforetime.

          Partholan was the second discoverer, the chief of his people.  Par-
          tholan
          brought with him the people that were first in many arts--brewing,
          cauldron making-first combat, farming, and a host of other things.

          Patholan chose a fertile place, cleared 4 plains, and homesteaded
          there.
          His wife slept with his retainer, which caused problems.  This resul-
          ted in the giving of the First Verdict, that of Delgnat.  Boan, Brea,
          Ban, Aine and 6 others were the "pure daughters" of Partholan, imply-
          ing perhaps that he had more, following the customs of the times.

          The generation of Partholan was the one responsible for first naming
          of
          places in Ireland.  Partholan's generation was also long-lived, and no
          plants grew old in their time.  His generation largely died out after
          a plague.

          Both of these first generations are referred to as men and women, not
          deities.  People of Arts [Aes Da'na] maybe yes, but not deithe [deit-
          ies].  This, at least, according to the Christians who recorded the
          tales.


                                                                            2354

          The third generation is that of Neimhedh (Nemed).  He came from
          Scythia.
          Neimhedh had 4 chiefs with him.  Nemhed fought and won three battles
          over the Fomhoire.  Fo-mhor (over the sea, or something like that). 
          Despite this, the Fomorians seemed to be quite good at opressing the
          Nemedians, by demanding 2/3 of their agricultural output at Samhain,
          delivered to Magh Cetne.  The Nemedians went to Greece and collected
          an army, some drui and ban-drui, wolves and venemous animals.  A
          proper challenge was delivered, and the battles were engaged.  The
          Fomorians were defeated at last.  Only 30 Nemedians survived.

          The next group of invaders are the somewhat mysterious Fir Bolg, or
          Bagmen.  The Fir Bolg had 5 chiefs (one more than all of the previous
          invaders) as did the De Dannan.  The Fir Bolg divided Ireland into 5
          parts.  Previous invasions had separated Ireland into 4 parts.  Much
          is made of the poetic, noise-shakin skill of the Fir Bolg.  They were
          some jammin' magickal folk, alright.  The Fir Bolg have the distinc-
          tion of the first "riogh" (king) in Ireland. So we have division into
          5 parts, kingship, and the use of iron.

          Now, the Sons of Nemed had not been sitting still all of this time. 
          They had been off in Greece, learning draidheacht, cleverness, nice-
          ness, and Spiffy Things In General (slight gloss from bad 19th century
          Victorian english).  These folks were called "Tuatha De" " ... that
          is, they considered their men of learning to be gods, and their
          husbandmen non-gods, so much was their power in every art and every
          druidic occultism besides.  Thence came the name, which is Tuathe De,
          to them."

          Now, please note that their ancestors are PEOPLE.  The TdD became so
          by
          virtue of their skills.  This is a process that would not be unfam-
          iliar to a good citizen of Republican (not Imperial) Rome.  One can
          become deific by proper actions, family and/or national devotion, and
          other things.  The TdD had been instructed in 4 cities in the North. 
          One has to infer that these cities are in Greece, where they are
          instructed in these arts.  Now, not all translations say this, exact-
          ly.  Greece and Spain are frequently glosses for the Otherworld, but
          not always.  The 4 Treasures were brought from Greece. As we have
          discussed the Treasures before, we shall pass in silence on them here.

          The TdD fought battles with the Athenians as their allies, and thru
          druidic demonry reanimated dead bodies that then rose up and fought as
          if they were living.  It is here that we learn that hazel or rowan
          twigs thru the neck do in reanimated corpses.  <Occult Factiod #912
          collect em all.)

          The TdD arrive in Ireland on a Monday, in the Calends of May, where
          they
          burn their ships on the shore so they cannot return, or the Fomorians
          use the ships.

          The TdD fought with the Fir Bolg (it is, after all Ireland we  are
          talking about...), won, lost, won again, lost again, were healed,
          hurt, etc.  Nuada gets his silver arm and loses kingship in this
          process.  The TdD slew all but a few of the Fir Bolg, who then fled to
          the outermost isles of the seas.  Compare this with the more archaic
          traditions of the Hebrides and Northern Islands of Ireland...


                                                                            2355

          The genealogies up to this point are enough to make a kinship special-
          ist
          whimper, cringe, and fall to sleep the final sleep, so we will ignore
          them, but to say that aside from Cessair, everyone is related (or
          sleeping with someone who is) to everyone else.  Biblical begatting is
          easier, trust me.

          The TdD are referred to as goblins in the text.  So much for the great
          contrast between the demonic Fomorians and Deific TdD.  If you care to
          argue that to a medieval monk all deities are one deity and all are
          demonic, then there is even less reason to consider the Fomor demonic.


                                                                            2356


          That said, the text has Eochaid triumph, "without enchantment of
          idols,
          shaped the distinction of good verses but as for knowledge of the
          warrior bands of whom we speak although we enumerate them we do not
          worship them."

          The picture is far more confused than ANY simple model, folks.  I have
          not even begun to discuss the "giant" stories. If I were to do so,
          then Finn and his buddies are giants, not unlike Jotuns.  But wait! 
          So is Cu!  And, if they are giants, then what are their parents?  Finn
          is descended from Baiscne, and Cu is descended (or a reincarnation) of
          Lugh.  So the Aes Dana=Giants?@(#*#*(@#_@

          If we get to the local spirits, worshipped well into the 18th century,
          and maybe later, (or the 20th, as Erynn thinks), any meaningful use of
          the term "God" has to be tossed out with the burnt brac after dinner.

          We have people, descended from the Trojans/Greeks learning heavy juju
          and becoming like Gods.  They fight, live, die, get reincarnated,
          stretch their influence far beyond a single generation, and are
          immortalized in song.  Remember, the Cauldron of Poesy, the only
          available text on the training of a fili (one who sees) reminds us
          that we are all more than our birth, at least potentially.

          As Patrick Ford has suggested, the written tales/sagas are probably
          just a sequencing of shorter oral bits, there is no real problem with
          dying on page 23, and having hot sweaty sex on page 25.

          They are also said to be immortal in the Otherworld.  Many of the
          later
           tales have all of these survivors gathering in the Otherworld (some-
          where near Miami or Desert Springs, I suspect) and only sometimes
          coming out to see us mere mortals.

          Also note (this flash of awen just in) that most of the folks that
          wander into faery are Aes Dana!  Reverend Kirk, Thomas the Rhymer, Tam
          Lin and many others.

          The Path to Faery must be (therefore) paved with Excellence.

          Now, the above analysis depends strictly on my reading of the texts. 
          I am quoting from the handiest text, the one that unfortunately has no
           bibliographic data in it, but is well-reasoned, erudite, and foot-
          noted to death. This is a facing-page xlation, btw.

          I am NOT saying that some of these beings are not worthy of devotion. 
          I am saying that it is not ness. true that all of them were viewed as
          "Gods" at all times in history, particularly not in the omnipotent,
          omniscient Xian meaning of the word, nor in the usage common to
          Bullfinch.

          It may be best to regard the Aes Dana as Shterpersavs, or "Short-Term-
          Personal-Saviors", in Dobbspeak.

                                  Walking with my Friends 
                                    Masochistic Maiden
                   The beach glistened under the sun, still wet from the
                   ebbing tide. My friends and I walked along leaving
                   tracks in the sand. We stopped at a tide pool and
                   discovered a bunch of sand dollars. The mark of a star
                   etched in each of the skeletal remains made us think of
                   the star at the center of the pentagram necklace I wore.

                   One gently held the necklace in his hand as we talked
                   about the meaning of each of the points. Earth, Air,
                   Fire, and Water, and then spirit. We talked how each of
                   these is a gift from Mother then we walked on.

                   He ran ahead and found a broken sand dollar with a tiny
                   mollusk, barely bigger than the head of a pin, inside.
                   We were amazed that anything so tiny could be alive. It
                   made us more aware of all the living things we often
                   overlook. Beneath our feet the ghost shrimp rested in
                   their tunnels, ocassionally blowing water back from the
                   many holes that dotted the beach. The larval forms of
                   life that clung to shells, stones, and settled in the
                   masses of seaweed thrown up by the surf, each caught our
                   attention before it was stolen by the gulls and crows
                   begging for scraps of bread.

                   Soaring overhead, the wings of the gulls whipped tiny
                   eddies of air that stirred the whisps of hair that had
                   escaped my ponytail and lifted the front few strands of
                   his hair. His eyes reflected the shine of the ocean on
                   the sand, and his quick voice and ready laughter made me
                   feel fleet of foot and full or the joy of youth.

                   After walking the beach we climbed a nature trail
                   through the woods. We stopped to look at the flowers,
                   delicate white stars with pink stripes. Again we thought
                   of the pentagram. We also imagined the Goddess of Spring
                   with feathers and flowers braided into her hair. A
                   little further we found a deep puddle with a surface as
                   smooth as glass. The sky and the trees were reflected
                   back at us in such precision and perfection that we
                   talked for a while of what that perfect world beyond the
                   puddle might be like. We wondered how we could make our
                   side of the mirror so peaceful and clean looking.

                   We walked further and came to a tall ancient tree and
                   wondered what stories it could have told, if we could
                   but understand. For a moment we could almost see the
                   native americans stalking deer and gathering herbs. The
                   tree, covered with a mass of moss as thick as carpeting
                   neither denied or confirmed our thoughts. Suddenly, with
                   a smile I thought of the ledgends of Gnomes that live
                   beneath the trees. This old trees roots held deep dark
                   holes and the forest litter was not creeping in to cover
                   them. The arching root looked so much like a roof over
                   an entry way and the size of the root system above the
                   ground indicated that a large family of Gnomes could
                   easily escape human eyes. Just a wink of time and they
                   could scamper out of sight beneath the undergrowth. We
                   could hear, if we stopped to listen, the soft sounds of


                                                                            2358

                   the wet undergrowth being disturbed. Was it the hurried
                   movement of little men in peaked caps?  Gnomes, weren't
                   they the creatures of the Elemental Earth? We could
                   smell the damp earth all about us. This was certainly a
                   good place for them.

                   After forest's close embrace, the clearing was sunshine
                   and sparkles. We saw dandilions growing on the green
                   hillside. We recognized them as one of springs first
                   splashes of color and representations of the sun shining
                   down on us. Carefully gathering several of the golden
                   heads we carried them to the mouth of the nearby stream
                   as it lead to the ocean. We threw them into the water,
                   watching them float down to the sea. With each flower we
                   sent a wish....no more oil slicks....less
                   polution...save some of the natural rain forests...each
                   of us remember to carry away a bit of trash every time
                   we go for a walk...no more whales beaching...no more
                   drift nets dragging sea mammals to their deaths...a bit
                   of nature for every child...and healing for Earth mother
                   where she has been strip mined. Then we turn to leave,
                   neither of us really wanting to go.

                   James isn't three yet, and Scott is only five, but they
                   were my friends as we walked and they gave me a chance
                   to share the wonder and beauty of the beach and the
                   woods.  Take time with the young. There is much they can
                   teach us and give us when we take the time to share
                   their world.
           
                          Firefawn:  A tale by Masochistic Maiden 


                        Silently the fawn stepped into the clearing. It's
                   fur dappled with white blended well with the filtered
                   light coming through the aspens. Here, high in the
                   Cascades, the fawn had greeted spring at its birth only
                   a few weeks ago. Now, its legs were strong and its
                   attitude cautious but playful. It stopped for a few
                   seconds and sniffed the mountain air.   Mother.. her
                   scent on the breeze... was just across the clearing.
                   There were other scents too......fresh shoots of grass,
                   tempting and new... the deep wet smell of the earth...a
                   sharp scent that he was not familiar with lay almost
                   hidden among the other odors. He hesitated, but wanted
                   so much to run to his Mother and drink deeply of her
                   life giving milk. She had been away for a big part of
                   the early morning grazing in a lower clearing. Now that
                   she was returning he could almost taste the warm rich
                   milk. He remianed cautious and took a second step.
                        His mother steped into the clearing oposite him.The
                   sun shined tawny and golden on her back and the early
                   grasses hid her tiny feet in a carpet of lushious green.
                   Her head held high she advanced with prancing steps
                   across the clearing. The wind at her back ruffled the
                   hair along her spine. She advanced across the clearing
                   and the fawn began to almost tremble with anticipation.
                   No longer cautious he leaped into the air and landed
                   with his hooves bunched together then sprang upward
                   again. Switching ends in the air he landed facing away


                                                                            2359

                   from his mother then quickly pivoted on his hind legs to
                   get her back into his sight. She seemed to take forever
                   to cross that clearing.
                        The wind again brought her scent to him, along with
                   the scent of that pungent but unknown thing. Somehow the
                   scent felt wrong but the fawn had no experience to give
                   him any indication how that scent figured into his
                   world.
                        His mother was nearly to him now and he frisked
                   across the few steps between them and burried his nose
                   beneath her flank. At that moment his mother caught the
                   faintest hint of the pungent smell that the fawn had
                   noticed. Her large eyes suddenly seemed to be even more
                   alert and her nostrils flared as she turned her head to
                   try and detect the message the scent brought. She had
                   not smelled this smell for a long time but she knew it
                   brought danger. She searched her distant memories... it
                   was not a man smell exactly, but somehow she associated
                   it with man. Pungent and sharp but not strong enough for
                   her to fix. Then the recognition flashed into her...
                   FIRE. The smell was smoke. She and her young fawn were
                   standing knee deep in the dead growth from last years
                   grass. Fire could sweep the understory of shrubs and
                   grasses with terrifying speed. She nudged her fawn and
                   began to move hurridly away from the smell. Upward...
                   the slopes of the mountains called her.
                        She began a slow trot toward the upper slopes,
                   angling toward the river. The scent of smoke grew and
                   soon it was not only a scent, but whisps of gray swirled
                   among the trees in the lower canopy when she looked over
                   her shoulder. Other animals had joined into the retreat
                   as she had traveled. Rabbits now dived between her feet.
                   Other deer, elk and a moose with a calf ran full out
                   past her. She picked up her pace to as much as the fawn
                   could handle. Leaping great distances a buck raced past
                   her. Behind them a raging forest fire was growing. It
                   threatened to overtake the sea of life desperately
                   running for the river.
                        Near the river a lone figure was aware of the
                   coming fire. He had been alerted by the passage of the
                   first few animals and had spotted the smoke high in the
                   air long ago. As he loaded his pack animal and prepared
                   to ford the river he saw that one doe and fawn lagged
                   far behind the other creatures who were preceding the
                   curtain of flames.
                        The doe reached a point between the tall trees that
                   had been blocked by a downed evergreen. Its trunk
                   stretched far and the upper branches reached as far the
                   other direction. This was not impossible for the doe,
                   she could easily jump the downfall. The fawn however
                   might not make the distance. There was no time left. The
                   doe flew over the barrier and hit the ground at a dead
                   run. The fawn, tired already, leaped but failed to reach
                   the top of the massive trunk. it ran left, then right,
                   but there was no way around. It leaped again and again.
                   The smoke of the fire began to fill the space between
                   the tree tops and darken the world where the fawn was
                   trapped between a wall of fire and a wall of unyeilding
                   trunk.


                                                                            2360

                        The doe fled when the smoke and heat became too
                   great. She reached the river and plunged to the other
                   side. A cascade of various creatures flowed over the
                   banks and to safety across the river.
                        The lone man also crossed the river and was filled
                   with sorrow when he did not see the fawn alongside the
                   doe as she pulled herself from the water. There was no
                   way he could return to the flames to rescue the fawn.
                   The evergreens were fully ignited and their heat was
                   easily felt even across the wide river. Running Buck
                   lead his horse and pack pony away from the heat. He'd be
                   a few days late getting back from his hunting trip due
                   to the fire, but it would save him miles to wait for it
                   to cool some and cut through the burnout to his village
                   to the west. He hoped the fire had not disturbed the
                   village or made the tribe move to a new site.
                        During the night a hard rain began to fall. It ran
                   down the roof of Running Buck's leanto in heavy rivers,
                   but it would put out the raging fire and begin to cool
                   the ground. Maybe Running Buck would not be so late.
                        Early in the morning a stand of blackened giants
                   and chared earth was all that greated Running Buck as he
                   reforded the river and began his journey homeward. The
                   trail he was following lead about 30 yards from the
                   downfall that had stopped the fawn. Remembering its
                   panicked eyes, Running Buck was again touched by
                   sadness. He turned his pony toward the last spot he saw
                   the fawn and decided to ride to the spot to say goodby
                   and ease its spirit into summerland and maybe collect
                   its pelt for a pair of mocossins for his daughter.
                        He rode along the massive trunk, once, twice, and
                   did not see the fawn. Just as he was about to turn away
                   he noticed a hollow under a part of the log. He
                   dismounted and carefully approached the hollow. When he
                   peered into the darkness beneath the massive trunk, a
                   tiny hoof was about all he could make out. Figuring the
                   frightened animal had forced itself under the trunk
                   moments before dying of smoke and heat, Running Buck
                   grabbed the hoof to draw the animal out. The pelt should
                   be a good one without any charing.
                        Suddenly the tiny hoof gave a jerk. The fawn was
                   still alive but trapped beneath the log. it had rammed
                   itself so far into the interior that it could not back
                   out on its own. Running Buck pulled hard on the kicking
                   hoof until a smoke streaked, terrified body came into
                   view. He slipped a length of leather cord around the
                   fawn's neck before he freed it from the hollow.
                        Once out from under the massive trunk the fawn
                   tried to spring away from Running Buck, but the leather
                   around its neck held it fast. Soon it stood meekly,
                   breathing hard but resigned to being held. Its tongue
                   hung from the corner of its lips and a light foam
                   followed the upper curve of its mouth. Running Buck
                   decided that any animal who survived the fire must be
                   blessed by the spirits and that he would not use this
                   animals pelt, but instead would take it back to the
                   village and give it to his daughter as a pet.
                        He lashed the fawn to the packframe on his pack
                   pony and rode off toward his village. The fire had left
                   a ugly scar across the foothills, but fortunately had


                                                                            2361

                   not reached as far as the quiet valley where his
                   tribe were camped.
                        Arriving in the village, Running Buck went first to
                   his family's site and entered the teepee. The lifting of
                   the flap let golden sunshine spill into the interior.
                   His daughter and wife looked up. Little dove, his
                   daughter jumped up suddenly to greet him and sent a bowl
                   of colored beads scattering at her feet from the beading
                   she had been working on. Running Buck swept her into his
                   arms with quick loving hands and told her about the
                   great fire...he told her about the fawn not being able
                   to leap the high tree trunk and being left by its
                   mother. Tears of sorrow came to Little Doves eyes as he
                   described the scene. He turned and carried Little Dove
                   out to the waiting ponies and showed her the fawn who
                   was still alive.
                        Little Does looked at the tiny body with its
                   spotted fur, and the big brown eyes and pink tongue and
                   thought it was the most beautiful animal she had ever
                   seen. Running Buck lifted the fawn down and tied it to
                   the side of the teepee. He left Little Dove to get
                   aquainted with her new friend and went to prepare an
                   animal bladder as a nursing bag for the fawn. The tribe
                   had several ponies giving milk for their foals. Perhaps
                   the fawn could be raised on their milk. He filled the
                   bladder with warm mare's milk and carried it back to
                   Little Dove.
                        She sat on the ground with the fawn gathered into
                   her lap like a puppy stroking its tiny ears and
                   scratching the fur between its eyes. Already the fawn
                   was becomming accoustomed to her gentle touch. She took
                   the bladder full of milk and stuck the end of the
                   protruding spout between her fingers so that the fawn
                   could suck on her fingers and draw milk from the
                   bladder. At first it turned away from the strange scent
                   of the mare's milk, but finally thirst overcame its fear
                   and it began to suck.
                        "Well," said Running Buck,"It looks like your young
                   friend may make it. Perhaps you should name it now."
                        "I already have." responded Little Dove. "I will
                   call it Firefawn, because he came from the fire."

                        Firefawn grew into a strong young buck during the
                   summer he spent with the tribe and made so many friends
                   among the tribe that they kept him with the ponies over
                   the winter.
                        When spring came again and it was time to let
                   Firefawn return to the wild. Running Buck made him a
                   bright red collar of leather so that none of the tribe
                   would accidently shoot him as he grazed among the trees.
                   For many years the deer with the red collar was seen by
                   members of the tribe and whenever they saw him they knew
                   their hunt would be successful. Firefawn became the lead
                   buck of a large herd of deer.
                        Running Buck and Little Dove's kindness returned to
                   help feed the tribe for many winters.

                        So in life, all that we do returns to us. Good for
                   good and bad for bad. Let good be what returns to your life.

                                       A DRAGON TALE
                                        by Kalioppe
                    ====================================================

          The Bardess of Caer Sidhe, am I, dropping in to tell you the tale of
          the last living Dragon on Earth - you know - the one who lived over
          the vale. The battle was great 'twixt the Wizard and she.  The Last
          Dragon met her demise.  When the smoke had all settled, the Wizard
          looked 'round; an object caught his sharp eyes...

          "Lo! What is that?" sayeth the Wizard.  "Good Goddess!  I think it's
          an egg!"  He scooped it up and sped to the castle, as quick as he
          could on old legs.  Now the townsfolk were thrilled that the Dragon
          was gone. They applauded the Wizard as great...he told not of the egg
          that he cared for so well, as he feared the babe's possible fate.

          The egg hatched and the Dragon was healthy.  The Wizard loved him so
          well! But one night as the Wizard lay sleeping, he awoke by the
          tinkling of bells. "Twas the Ancients who came a calling, to tell him
          his time was near.  He thought, with a jolt, "Who will care for this
          babe...the one who has grown so dear?"

          Sadly, he called the Council and told of the callers in the night.  He
          told them of the Dragon and then explained his plight.  He told them
          that the Dragon was the symbol of the strong.  He persuaded them to
          care for him... then began his journey long.

          All wanted to care for the baby...but then the touble broke out! 
          There were too many squires and not enough peasants...a cauldron of
          trouble, no doubt!!  "I want to feed it!"  "I want to school it!"  "I
          do!"  "No, me! Not you!"  They set up rules so lofty, the work was
          done by only a few...

          Jealousy brewed more turmoil, and then the bragging began:  "I gave up
          MY food for the baby...yes, I am a WONDERFUL man!"  "That's NOTHING!"
          said one woman.  "I gave him my ONLY shawl!"  Egos rose and swelled so
          great, they encompassed one and all.  Sadly enough, it got to the
          point with themselves they were duly impressed.  They never saw to the
          Dragon...they were too busy with egos, at best.

          The baby died of hunger.  The baby died alone.  The baby died of
          ill-attention, too weak to even moan.  When the folk returned to the
          castle and found their charge quite dead, they looked at each other
          and pointed their fingers, then looked at the sky overhead.  The
          clouds were dark, but from their depths, many voices spake as one: 
          "The first law is love," spake the Goddess, "The second is 'ye harm
          none!'"  Emptiness welled up inside as their tears began to stream. 
          For they had killed the Last Dragon, and their one and only dream...

          That is the story I traversed to tell, and to it, I beg, pay great
          heed. Always take time to help one another - the time to do a good
          deed. Everyone is different, though the same at times, it seems. 
          Accept your neighbors differences, and cultivate their dreams.

          To: All                                  
          Subject: The Goddess Movement

           I was sitting in the breakroom at work this morning (you know, the
          place where bible quotations greet us in the mornings :) and I dis-
          covered the following article in the 'Colorado Living' section of "The
          Denver Post."  Enjoy

          "The Goddess Movement: Woman-based Spirituality gains followers"
           by Leslie Petrovski

           In mid-September in a sparsely furnished Washington Park home, about
          12 women, mostly in their 30s and 40s, will gather to celebrate Mabon
          -- or fall equinox (sept 23). After a vegetarian potluck dinner, the
          group will sit in a circle around a basket filled with apples, tiny
          pumpkins and acorns -- fruits from the harvest.

           One woman, who started this feminist spirituality group two years
          ago, will start the ceremony by casting the circle -- creating sacred
          space by invoking the elements (eart, fire, water and air) and Goddes-
          ses associated with each element.  During the ritual, the women will
          ask for individual healing, then pass around a globe while asking for
          planetary healing. One might request the universe to heal the suffer-
          ing of the world's women; another will seek healing of the oceans; yet
          another asks for healing in Bosnia. More and more, all over the
          country, women (and some men) are gathering together to practice a
          woman-based spirituality.  They give themselves many names, and their
          rituals vary from group to group.  

          "Feminist spirituality combines different movements," explains 
          Starhawk, author of "The Spiral Dance," an introductory text to
          witchcraft. "Some are working within Jewish and Christian traditions
          to ressurrect female images; others are outside any organized tradit-
          ional; others participate in the Wicca tradition.  There is a lot of
          diversity in the movement.  What feminist spirituality does is put our
          experience, as individuals and as woman, at the center of our spirit-
          uality."

          There are no estimates of the number of people worshipping this way,
          although journalist Margo Adler, in her book "Drawing Down the Moon," 
          estimates there are 100,000 American pagans, people who call themsel-
          ves witches, Druids or Goddess worshippers -- people who "look to the
          old pre-Christian nature religions of Europe."

          There are many clues of the prevalence of the Goddess.  A young
          scholar completing her Ph.D. at the University of Colorado said, "I
          know a number of women who are big into the Goddess."  Bookstores are
          filled with books dedicated to women's spirituality.  Even driving the
          highway, you'll notice discreet bumper-stickers like "Goddess Bless."

          In Goddess spirituality, the cycles of nature are worshipped and
          celebrated -- winter, spring, summer and autumn -- and are viewed as
          metaphors for birth, growth, fading and death.  Attributes tradition-
          ally viewed as femine (i.e., intuition and nurturing) are revered.
           Defining the Goddess religion, however, is about as easy as catching 
          fish with bare hands.  But there is a rich and ancient history as-
          sociated with it.  Old Europe, with its woman-focused religions, was


                                                                            2364

          settled prior to 4000 B.C.  Similar earth-based, female cultures
          existed in Crete, Greece, Catal Huyuk and elsewhere.

           "A lot of this occurred in rural centers," exlains University of
          Denver a art Historian M.E. Warlick.  "In agrarian societies, they
          think of the earth as the mother and typically the earth is a God-
          dess." Eventually, the Goddess-based religions were displaced by
          warrior gods like Zeus and Yahweh.  Some scholars suggest that Goddess
          worshippers went underground, and that the religion survive in secret.

          In the '60s, that began to change.  The feminist movement, which 
          brought a new ethic of control to women, also allowed women (and men)
          to look toward feminine images for religious sustenance.  Women and
          men began to practice openly in the Wiccan traditions or create their
          own feminist spirituality.

          To oversimplify the Goddess: There are no rules, except freedom; there
          is no bible, no major doctrine; what has survived of ancient Goddess
          religions has come down in fragments.  Most Goddess worshippers do
          share the goal of living in harmony with nature.

          "As a witch," explains Elisa Robyn, a Denver-based spiritual coun-
          selor, "I have an intimate relationship with the deity, that is the
          Goddess and the God.  I believe in reincarnation.  And I believe in
          karma -- whatever I create inside of me are the energies the world
          hands back to me."  "A couple of years ago, I was at Sunday school at
          the church we were attending," she remembers.  "We were talking about
          virgin birth.  I raised my hand, trambling, and I said, 'I think I'm
          not a Christian anymore.  I don't think Jesus intended us to worship
          him.'"

          Confused and troubled by this realization, Rebecca held a birthday
          party for herself, inviting all of her female friends to talk about
          God. Not satisfied with this intellectual approach, Rebecca, 43, began
          organizing rituals in accordance with the eight Sabbats of the Wiccan
          year: Yule to acknowledge the winter solstice; Brigid, or Candlemas,
          dedicated to the Goddess of fire and inspiration; the Ecostar Ritual
          to celebrate the spring equinox; Beltane, or May Eve; Litha, or the
          summer solstice; Lughnasad to mourn the dying Sun King; Mabon, or the
          fall equinox; Samhain, or Halloween, that marks the end and the
          beginning of a new year. Due to Rebecca's urgings, a small group of
          women has evolved to conduct rituals and tentatively celebrate the
          seasons.  Rebecca's mailing list is now up to 30 women.

          The Goddess movement is "attracting a wide range of people," explains
          Starhawk, who was raised Jewish, "from a middle-aged women who have
          lived very conventional lives to young, punk anarchists."

          Lois Yackley, 49, a Denver elementary-school teacher and member of
          Rebecca's Goddess group, sees her involvement as an outgrowth of her
          mental health.  Like many women who are seeking a woman-based spirit-
          uality, Lois, a former Catholic, always felt the absence of women in
          the church.  As she grew in therapy, women's issues became increas-
          ingly important to her. "The next step in the feminist movement," Lois
          says, "is spiritual. Some feminists are saying that there will be nore
          mor progress (in the movement) unless it's spiritual."


                                                                            2365


          Lois became involved in Rebecca's group through a growing friendship
          with Darcie, the mother of a child in Lois' class.  As their friend-
          ship matured, they shared books on feminist spirituality and attended
          Rebecca's rituals and parties. "Women are getting together to see how
          we feel about things.  We validate out feelings and thoughts.  This
          feels right."

          Darcie, 43, is an artist and homemaker, who struggles with her 
          conflicting feelings for her church (she is a Methodist and a church
          trustee) and her blossoming interest in feminist spirituality.  "I no
          longer have a strong belief (in Christianity), but I'm interested in
          the structure of my family," she explains.  "It's a difficult situat-
          ion for me, emotionally and psychologically.  I feel very strongly
          about the family worshipping together, so I'm not ready to give (the
          church) up until I have something to replace it with."

          Rebecca's group gives Darcie a place to explore her new ideas about
          spirituality with women who feel the same way.  "I'm trying to move
          toward believing not in one power over all, but a multiple power
          within," Darcie explains.

          "This matches the political climates of the times," explains Robyn.
          "Women are looking for something about themselves that's special.  So
          the Goddess is becoming more prevalent."  Robyn, who also was raised
          Jewish and now practices in the Wiccan tradition, adds that, "Women
          are looking for their power.  This is right in line with the ecology
          movement, the women's movement, the personal growth movement."

          "When women get into witchcraft, it is a blossoming experience.  There
          are role models -- women of power, Goddesses -- it's a totally dif-
          ferent energy and perception."

                                       Funeral rites  
                                        Oz Caliburn 
          A long while ago, I said I would post the funeral service that I had
          put together for my sister.  Having at long last got my act together,
          here it is.  The sources for the rite were "Magical Rites from the
          Crystal Well" by Fitch, and "The Book of the Prophet" by Gibran.  A
          couple of the poems were written by my other sister, and by my father. 
          The final poem is unsourced, but I first saw it in a copy of "The
          Wiccan", which was an AustPagan newsletter.

          As a bit of background, my sister Vicki was spastic and mentally
          retarded.  She died at the age of 35, after renal failure.  My wife
          and I were at her deathbed, and actually took her across - no easy
          task, as her mind was very hard to "grip".  Vicki, although severely
          retarded (mentally she was about 3-4, could not read etc) had grasped
          the fact that she wasn't going to get better from her last illness,
          and had in fact asked me to "help her die".

          I hope that this rite, my last gift to my sister (even if I have taken
          it from various sources), may help inspire some of you who find
          yourself in similar circumstances.  It is non-denominational, focusses
          on no particular deity, and served it's pupose admirably at the time.

                 ******************************

          Part 1

          We have for a while lost one who is dear to us, And we all feel the
          loss. But it is only for a time, and we will lose our sorrow.

          There is a reason for being here, and a reason for going. The Other
          Side, the Places Beyond, Are warm, pleasing and beautiful with all
          ills gone, and youth anew.

          There is a reason for leaving, when the purpose of this life is done.
          We must all journey beyond to pause, to rest, and to wait for those
          who are loved, In a place far from the cares of this world, with
          happiness and strength renewed. For dying is only a mode of forget-
          ting, a way of rest, a way of returning to the Eternal Source, however
          we may see It.

          It is said in ancient lore -

          "Arrayed in some new fleshly disguise,
          Another mother gives birth.
          With sturdier limbs and brighter brain,
          The old soul takes the road again".

          (At this point, my other sister read this poem - I believe she wrote
          it herself, but from where she drew her inspiration, I can only
          wonder)

          You came and touched so many hearts
          In so many different ways.
          You gave so much, and asked very little in return.
          There is an emptiness as if a part of me is missing,
          But I am sure with time you will show me how to be whole again.
          I know you are safe now, and nothing can harm you.
          Remember, although we're apart,
          We will always be together.

          Life and death are one, as the river and the sea are one. For what is
          it to die but to stand naked in the wind, And to melt in the sun?
          What is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from it's
          restless tides That it may rise, and expand, and seek it's Gods
          unencumbered?

          Only when you drink from the river of silence
          Shall you indeed sing.
          And when you have reached the mountaintop,
          Then shall you begin to climb.
          And when the Earth has claimed your limbs, then shall you truly
          dance.

          There'll be no more pain, no more ills,

          Do not stand at my grave and weep,
          I am not there, I do not sleep.
          I am a thousand winds that blow,
          I am the diamond glints on snow.
          I am sun on ripened grain,
          I am the gentle Autumn's rain.
          When you wake in the morning's hush
          I am the swift uplifting rush
          Of quiet birds in circled flight.
          I am the stars that shine at night.
          Do not stand at my grave and cry,
          I am not there, I did not die.

     INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:  The following transcript comes from a talk
     that Eric Pryor gave at the Victory in Jesus Church in Denver, Colorado at
     7:00 p.m. Sunday, February 24, 1991.  There were about 200-250 people in
     attendance.  The meeting was held in the old Federal movie theatre, which
     has definitely seen better days.  Attendees were for the most part working
     class people with families.  The audience was quite vocal and
     enthusiastic.  Besides myself, there were 5 other pagans in the audience,
     scattered around.  At least one of these also has a tape recording of the
     proceedings.

     Pastor Cordova  "Larry Lea prayed, and because he prayed, the very general
     that attacked him is the very general that got saved." 1/

     ("Hallelujah!" General praise and applause from the audience.)

     this brother, I call up the Reverend brother, come to devil, I mean come to
     Denver, and let's give the Devil a black eye.  And he called me up and
     says, Brother, let's not only, let's not only give a black eye, let's,
     let's break a couple of legs already!  Alright, Amen! (Applause and cheers
     from audience.) Yes!  Give him a hand.  Yes!  Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!
     Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!

     I want you to stand up and I want you to raise your hands (unintelligible)
     Father, in Jesus' name I pray that you anoint our brethren.  That his words
     would be your words.  His thoughts would be your thoughts, Father.  That he
     would not pull any punches, Father.  That he would be an oracle of yours,
     Father.  Oh Father, you who can set him on fire for you, God, let his words
     be as fire, Father, and let the hearts of the people be as brass.  Oh, GOD
     bring revival to our lives and we'll give you the PRAISE and we'll give you
     the glory.  In Jesus' name.  People, we don't want you to leave tonight if
     you have a need.  If you're not filled with the Holy Spirit after this
     brother's through, we're gonna be down here.  Some of us ministers are
     gonna be down here with Eric.  We're gonna be laying hands on you.  We're
     gonna be praying for you that God the Holy Spirit would set you on fire
     cause let me tell you something, time is short.  It is short.  Amen. 
     Please welcome Eric.

     Pryor:  There're so many microphones around here I don't know what to do
     with them.  Harvesting souls or harvesting microphones here, I don't know?
     Well, I'm, I'm I'm glad, uh, to be here in Denver, and I'll tell you one
     thing though, the Strongman, uh, he didn't want me here.  He didn't want me
     here because he knows that I know.  He knows that I know that he is a stone
     cold liar.  (That's right! comment from audience)  Big time liar.  What I'd
     like to do before we, before I get into my testimony, I, after that I've
     got a scripture I'd like to back it up with.  I'd like for all of us to do
     something really special because this glorifies God, OK?  And this is part
     of giving the Devil a black eye so if you'll just join in with me, if you
     dear ones would just stand up and join in with me, we're gonna work on
     giving the Devil a black eye, OK?  (Audience stands up.)

     Father God, we stand here before you tonight, we stand here before you
     tonight because we love you, Father God.  Father God, we know that you are
     the way, the truth, and the light.  Only through you and your son Christ
     Jesus, through Christ Jesus can we have eternal life and that SATAN IS A
     LIAR!  So we're gonna do some spiritual warfare here tonight for you,
     Father God, if it please you.  SATAN!  WE SERVE YOU NOTICE.  WHERE THE
     LIGHT IS, THE DARKNESS SHALL NOT OVERCOME AND THAT SATAN, WE BIND YOU UP
     AND WE CAST YOU DOWN!  ACCORDING TO MATTHEW 16:19 IT SAYS "WHATEVER IS




                                                                            2369

     BOUND HERE ON EARTH WILL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN and whatever seeds are sown
     here on earth will be sown in heaven," so, Satan, WE BIND YOU UP AND WE
     CAST YOU DOWN AND WE PUT YOU RIGHT UNDER OUT FOOT!  WE SERVE YOU NOTICE,
     GET DOWN, SATAN, GET DOWN!  Satan get thee behind us.  Father, we sow the
     seeds of gospel, and we sow the seeds of love, and we sow the seeds of
     truth so that all the people to the corners of the world would know of your
     glory through your son Christ Jesus, THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,
     SATAN WE SERVE YOU NOTICE, YOU GET OUT OF DENVER!  We have served you
     notice you have no legal right in here, Satan, you have absolutely no legal
     right to be here.

     Now, Dear ones, I want to hear something that's gonna glorify God.  I don't
     care what you shout, but on the count of three, we're gonna shout to the
     Lord because in the Bible, all through the Bible it said that they shouted
     before the Lord.  As a matter fact, when Jesus comes, comes back, he's
     gonna come back with a SHOUT!  And he's probably gonna be saying I'M
     COMING!  So I'm gonna tell you something, we're gonna shout before the Lord
     and we're gonna glorify the Lord with that shout, I don't care you yell
     Hallelujah, Satan be gone, whatever, but on the count of three we're gonna
     shout before the Lord and we're gonna shake the walls of this temple and
     we're gonna let Satan know that WE'RE HERE AND HE'S NOT WELCOME!  One, two,
     three! (General shouting and cheering by the audience.)

     Yeah.  That feels good.  That feels good and that glorifies the Lord, I
     tell you, that glorifies the Lord.  Sometimes it takes a shout to wake up
     the dead!  Let's don't sleep!  Don't let Satan get up behind you and stick
     a knife in your back!  He did it to me!  He was giving me black eyes all my
     life.  So Satan's a liar and I'll tell you what - I'm here through Christ
     Jesus and the Holy Spirit running through me.  I'm gonna kick him right
     back every time.  That's why I wear snakeskin boots, cause it says "and you
     shall be walking on serpents heads!"  Scorpions and snakes, right?  That's
     all I have to say to Satan.  Up your butt! (Applause and cheering from
     audience.)

     You can sit down.  Aren't you glad I don't sing?  I wouldn't know what to
     sing anyway, other than anointing come upon me and praise the Lord that's
     about all I know.  And that's about all I want to know, is praise the Lord
     Jesus Christ for his goodness and his mercy that he hung on that tree and
     he bled for us.  Think about that.  Here was a man, OK, he was God, but he
     was temptations each one, uh, each and every one of us have, yet he was
     nailed to that tree.  Railroad spikes, think of it, going through his
     wrists and through his feet AND HE WENT INTO THE VERY DEPTHS OF HELL AND
     TOOK THE KEYS OF POWER FROM SATAN AND GAVE THEM TO THE SAINTS, AND THAT
     MEANS YOU!  AND YOU CAN USE USE KEYS!  THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT!  If you have
     the believer's authority, I want to tell you something, you put on the
     whole armor of God and the Holy Spirit runs through you, every time Satan
     sees you, boy he runs and he screams.  He starts hiding up under every
     little rock just like the sneaky little snake he is.  Maybe we ought to
     make a pair of snakeskin boots out of him tonight.

     So I'll tell you something about myself, OK?  Whew!  Boy I just, I just
     love shouting before the Lord and I just love giving the Devil a black eye
     because man he had me so deceived.  When I was a little kid, I uh, grew up
     in a uh, really dysfunctional family and that's a very polite way of
     putting it.  I was abused.  Uh, I was beaten.  Matter of fact, I wasn't
     beaten, uh, I was actually tortured.  At a very early age I learned that
     uh, I had to depend on God for everything.  Now I didn't know anything much
     about life.  I didn't even really know too much about Jesus.  And at 4 or 5




                                                                            2370

     years old I can remember getting on my knees and crying and saying God,
     would you be my father.  Now in later years I come to know that that word
     that Jesus Christ used was Abba, which is Arabic for Daddy.  And he's all
     of our Daddy.  And he loves each and every one of you, and that's for sure. 
     That's for sure.

     So I grew up, you know, under a lot of oppressions.  Matter of fact, even
     before I was born the doctor said to my mother, you know, uh, Mrs. Pryor.
     She'd spent six months in a uh, mental institution, my father actually uh,
     helped drive her crazy with a bit of help from Satan.  And she said "Mrs.
     Pryor, don't have this kid."  I already, she already had three other kids.
     She said "don't have this child.  You should abort this child."  She said
     "no, no, no, no, I'm gonna keep it and I don't care what my husband says I
     don't care what anybody says, I'm gonna keep this child."  And she had me
     and, uh, I grew up in a bunch of forester(sic) homes for the first several
     years of my life.  It's sketchy at best I'm researching my life right now
     for an autobiography.  But a lot of people want to really know what
     happened
     on the inside.

     So any rate, uh, it's pretty (can't hear word) to find out that for the
     first several years of your life you really don't know where you are or
     nobody will tell you.  So any rate, I grew up depending on the Lord for
     everything.  But I didn't really see it as salvation or anything it was
     just naturally praying for the Lord to come and help me.  And he did.  He
     answered those prayers.  He knew I wasn't born again.  And, uh, since I had
     no control over my life, you know, I was getting abused.  My parents would
     do things like hide food on me.  I'd go to school, one time I went to
     school with a broken foot.  One time I had my skull fractured and I passed
     out in the school and woke up semi-con, uh, came out of a coma in a
     hospital.  Didn't even know what happened to me.  Why I had passed out,
     'cause night before I was beaten all night and had my skull split.




                                                                            2371


     It was a, it was, a rough upbring,uh, up upbringing and I call it uh, uh,
     Larry Lea, God bless him, he's uh, he's one of my uh, spiritual fathers and
     he calls them prayer warriors and I call them GLADIATORS!  FRONT LINE MEN!
     They see some big time combat with the sword of the spirit.  You always
     associate gladiators with that sword.  Boy, I'll tell you, this is our
     sword right here. (Holding Bible aloft.  amen, etc. from audience.) And how
     many of you know that this is a mighty sword.  Big time mighty.  (applause)

     So, what happened was, is I grew up, I sought power and I sought it in all
     the wrong places.  Control.  So that I wouldn't have to put up with the
     beatings, so that I could eat, so that I could just live a normal life like
     any other kid.  I had all these problems.  I just wanted to live a normal
     life.  So I sought power.

     And around the age of, well actually at 8 years old I was already reading
     Tarot cards.  But around 10 years old is when I really started to
     intelligently seek power and I'd always been taught that God was a
     judgmental God.  I was taught that "GOD WILL STRIKE YOU DEAD if you do
     this.  GOD WILL STRIKE YOU DEAD if you do that."  Some of you older timers
     might know something about the manipulation of the hand and the body and
     how God will strike you dead, if you know what I'm saying, you know.  Well
     I'll tell you, everything was God will strike you dead.  And I started
     thinking "what's going on here?  What kind of God is this?"  But I was
     taught that Satan would give you, would give you power, he would give you
     money, he would give you the girls that you want.  He'll give you, he'll
     give you everything.  So I got a really wrong picture of Satan.  That was a
     deception.  And I was taught that deception, believe it or not, by people
     who were teaching other people about God.  Preachers.

     So I sought out, I actively sought out, the occult sciences so that I might
     study to show myself approved as it were.  And I studied just about every
     occult science there was.  It started out, candy coated enough with
     Witchcraft.  I'm a white Witch.  I'm not, I'm not out there to hurt
     anybody, I'm just gonna you know heal everybody and love on trees and love
     on the Goddess and worship nature.  Well why worship nature when you can
     worship THAT WHICH CREATED NATURE? (audience applause and comment.) WHY BE
     SO OPPRESSED WITH SATAN WHEN GOD CREATED LUCIFER WHO FELL AND BECAME SATAN?
     GOD IS SO MUCH MORE AMAZING!  It's amazing that I'm here today.  It is
     amazing that I'm alive!  I have half the Pagan nation cursing me!  Do I
     look dead to you?  No.  It's but by the grace of God that I'm here. 
     Because of his love and his mercy that I'm here.

     So what happened, I got involved in the occult and I really steeped in it.
     And I studied.  Then one day, I tried to get things right with my family.
     I, by that time I was 15 years old, I'd already been an ordained High
     Priest.  People were already starting to name BABIES after me!  I was like
     a Mozart of the occult community, the prodigal child!  I lived in a temple! 
     I lived in an occult temple 24 hours a day!  I could get up, I had books
     all over the place and anything that I wanted to know.  I had some of the
     finest occult teachers that the world could offer.  I'm talking about the
     big guns.  And they all came and they trained me, mano y mano.  They
     discipled me just like I'm being discipled by Pastor Dick Bernal over at
     Jubilee Christian Center.  Just like I'm being uh, discipled by, uh, uh,
     uh, Pastor Kennedy and Larry Lea, people like that.  I was discipled by the
     greats in the occult now I'm being discipled by the greats in the Lord!
     (audience
     applause.)




                                                                            2372

     So, I tried to get things right with my family, and one day I, I had quit
     school.  I was selling my body in New York City.  I was in between New
     Jersey and New York as a male prostitute and I was going into covendoms in 
     New York City.  I was doing all kinds of crazy things.  I was living in a
     temple and kinda coming back into Jersey and sniffing around and seeing
     what was up.  I was doing drugs boy you name it, I would eat it.  If I
     thought it would get you high, I would eat it.  And I did.  I, I, I had
     more occult books, I had, as a matter of fact, my library at one time was
     big enough to fill at least one wall from the floor to the ceiling high of
     some of the finest occult books that you could get and the people that
     wrote those books were the people that were teaching me.

     So at any rate, I decided I'd try to get things right with my father.  For
     some reason I was like a dog that had been kicked and wanted to come back
     to his master with his tail between his legs.  So I tried to get things
     right with my family, but, uh, of course it didn't work out.  And one day I
     went to the high school that I used to go, used to go to school at, and I
     sat in the assembly and Word of Life Singers from Scroon Lake, New York,
     Jack Wurtz and Word of Life Singers came in.  They had a crusade.  And boy,
     I'll tell you, those, those, those singers just amazed me.  Now I was very
     impressed that day and I don't know how I came across this woman, I don't
     remember, uh, I had a syringe filled up with battery acid in my locker and
     I was thinking, well after this crusade I'm just gonna go into the bath-
     room, I'm gonna take that syringe, big 16 gauge needle, and just take it IV
     and painful or not, I didn't care, I was just going to do my life in.

     And, uh, one young lady just said she had a burden for me.  She was going
     to sing but she came up to me and she said look, and gave me this little
     tract and told me a little bit about the Lord.  And I FELT something from
     her.  I felt LOVE come from this woman by impartation with the love of the
     Holy Spirit.  And I went back and I asked my father, I said, "Dad, I want
     to go to this this, this crusade."  My father over his, uh, Jack Daniels
     and Schmitz Beer is like, "Ah, you can't go."

     So I went anyway.  And I walked from Bergenfield, New Jersey to Hackensack
     New Jersey and I was the first one there.  And I sat in an empty auditorium
     and watched these people set everything up and I was just amazed by the
     whole thing.  Well, they got to singing (unintelligible) and they
     evangelized and they spoke about the Lord, and they had an altar call.  And
     it hit me.  And I'll tell you I came down for that altar call.  When I came
     down for that altar call I believe that I had a real genuine experience
     with  the Lord at that time.  I mean I was blasted with something.  And I
     later was uh, baptized.  I was submerged in a baptismal tank.  And, uh, the
     small occult book collection that I had was nothing compared to the
     collection you'll see on the video tape that I burnt up, but it burnt up.

     But the interesting thing about these people were that they were legalis-
     tic.  They taught me how to rattle off scripture like a machine gun.  They
     taught me all the "thou shalt nots."  They told me you MUST cut your hair. 
     You MUST do this, you MUST do that.  You CAN'T do this, you CAN'T do that. 
     "I'VE been a Christian longer than you, I know."  Notice they didn't say
     anything about the Lord says.  They said I say and YOU must.  They were
     judgmental.  They were clear with me.  And then they sent me up to, uh, a
     Bible Institute.  And there I was a wrangler and I worked with the youth,
     and I had plenty of scripture in me.  And I knew Jesus Christ was Lord, I 
     just didn't like the life I was living.  It was just plain old too rigid.

     I was still, I still had garbage pail mouth.  My mind hadn't been renewed.




                                                                            2373

     And that's where Satan goes, right into the mind.  That's where he does his
     warfare.  Because when Jesus is in your heart, he can't get in there, but
     he can get in your mind alright.  And he can tell you what you can't do. 
     He can kinda tell you what you should do.  So I went up there and we got
     into an argument over something really stupid.  Believe it or not, it was a
     buck knife.  Now as a wrangler, it was part of my job if I had to snap some
     leather to save a child's life, or my life or a horse's life or something,
     I needed that knife to snap some leather.  And they couldn't deal, these
     are, these are Christian brothers and sisters, they could not deal with
     this. they said, "It presents a bad image of God to carry that knife in
     front of those young children."  I said "well, don't you think it would
     present a worse image if one of those children got trampled to death?  I
     need that knife to snap leather."  And he just went on about this knife and
     I'm thinking "what's going on here?"  Finally I said, "you want the knife
     so bad?"  I took the knife out and I stuck it in his desk and I said,
     "that's it" and I left.

     I said well, you know I mean, it was something after Jesus, I knew there
     was some kind of power there.  I knew there was power there, but I just
     couldn't believe that cause I didn't know anything about a personal
     relationship with Abba Father.  I knew nothing of that.  So I left, and
     boy, the Strongman was right behind me going, hehehe, "we got him now.  Oh
     we got this guy now.  Not only is he already a high priest, but he knows
     where to go."  And I did.  I went right back to New York City.  Right back
     to those temples and I started studying even more fervently, trying to find
     a way to get back to God.  That's all I wanted to do.

     It was candy-coated at first.  I didn't think I was doing anything wrong at
     first.  And I started to digress into the darkness.  I mean farther and
     farther.  There were points where I blatantly didn't care.  And I hexed and
     I cursed, and let me tell you something, I've heard people say that uh,
     Satanists are taught not to curse Christians because, uh, Christians know
     the Lord.  Let me tell you something, Satanists will curse God himself.
     They'll curse anything.  They'll curse anything that moves including
     THEMSELVES and they don't even know it!  But they don't care.

     So I got involved in Voodoo, Santeria, Macumba, Ceremonial Magick,
     Witchcraft, you name it, I was into it.  Ouija boards - I had a collection
     of em.  Tarot cards - I had one of the largest private collections of Tarot
     cards in the United States.  I was into it all.  All of it.

     And I'll tell you, as time progressed I got farther and farther into the
     darkness and I tried to get involved with the powers of the secular world
     and keep my occult practices which I believed to be spiritual practices at
     the time, off to the side, just get involved in pursuing my artwork.  And
     I, I was gettin pretty good with it for awhile.  I was making some money. 
     I wound up getting married, had two kids, we started to buy a plane,
     started to put money down on my first town house, uh, I had two cars and I
     was really, really, really being impressed by the Strongman.  And I was
     drinking, I was drugging, I was doing all kinds of things.  I was shot four
     times, no actually I was shot five times, and was stabbed four times.  I've
     still got the bullet holes in my body to prove it.  One time I actually
     went through a third story window and had my neck fractured and my lower
     back fractured, but by the grace of God I survived.  And actually got up
     and walked away.  But any rate, no, I wound up in the hospital though
     nonetheless.

     But any rate, I got steeped in darkness and uh, one day in 1987 my wife and




                                                                            2374

     I really we just weren't hitting it off my first wife and I, I started to
     really seek after help with my problems with alcohol, my depression and all
     this other stuff.  And I was practicing dark stuff and I just didn't put
     two and two together.  I didn't know that that was the SOURCE of my
     OPPRESSIONS!  I didn't know that.  That's how deceived I was!  AND I KNEW
     WHO SATAN WAS!  I HELPED HIM WRITE SOME OF THE BATTLE PLANS!

     So, my wife and I split up.  And I left in 1987 for a pack of cigarettes
     and never came back.  Came out here to the west coast.  And boy, I'll tell
     you, what happened then, that was the most amazing thing that's ever
     happened to me in my entire life.  And I'll praise and worship the Lord any
     way you want me to standing on my HEAD if he wants me to! (Comments from
     audience "Yes!  Yes!  Hallelujah!)  I founded New Earth Temple.  And I used
     to go out and do all these works like help the homeless, feed the homeless. 
     I used to try to clothe the homeless.  I even lived with them.  I had a
     business out here for a while.  I even lived with them.  I gave up the
     business to live with them.  I worked with the Red Cross during the
     earthquake.  I did everything trying to be a humanitarian, figuring, well,
     you know God's got a weigh that this is good.

     I never really thought about the Lord, although, it's funny, or not funny
     depending on kinda how you look at it, alot of times I'd hold Circles,
     which is like a service, with the covendom, and while they were all
     chanting he he, in Enochian, under my breath I was saying Praise the Lord
     Jesus Christ.  I was a hypocrite!  Jesus Christ was my ace up my sleeve. 
     Now I can't explain any of this.  I don't know how to explain any of this. 
     But I do know one thing, God is not a loving god, he IS love!  He is love!
     (amens from the audience.)  PURE, UNADULTERATED LOVE!  AND HE GAVE HIS ONLY
     BEGOTTEN SON THAT NONE OF US SHOULD PERISH, BUT LIVE AN EVERLASTING LIFE
     WITH HIM!  And I can think of no better place to be than with God, who can
     take Satan and just go like that and trash him in a moment.  Satan knows
     that the war has been won.  But he's gonna take down as many people as he
     can.  I know he tried to take me down but I, I'm wise to him now.  And not
     only that, but I got his battle plans and I'm gonna expose him to the
     saints ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!!  ALL AROUND THE WORLD!!! (Applause from
     audience.) AND THAT INCLUDES (unintelligible)

     Christians are not wimps.  Brother I know that we're not wimps. (audience
     response - yea)  WE'RE THE MIGHTY SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE ONE LIVING
     GOD!  WE ARE A ROYAL PRIESTHOOD!  WE ARE KINGS AND QUEENS, HEIRS TO TRONES
     IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN!  AND WE WILL BE UP THERE WITH JESUS CHRIST AND WE
     will have angels to judge.  WE WILL RULE!  WE ARE RULERS!  We're better
     than this.  We are better than this what's happening out here in the world. 

     GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD!  DON'T YOU EVER
     FORGET IT! (Applause and cheers from audience)  AND REMEMBER, IT'S NOT YOU,
     BUT IT'S HIM, ABBA FATHER, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT FLOWS THROUGH YOU!
     THROUGH THE AUTHORITY INVESTED IN YOU IN JESUS CHRIST'S NAME THAT YOU CAN
     KICK SATAN RIGHT IN THE TAIL EVERY TIME AND WIN!  Put the whole armor of
     God on!  (Applause and cheers.)

     God alone.  I didn't mean to get off track there, but every now and then
     the Holy Spirit goes, "Hey, Eric, say this."  The Holy Ghost!  (Laughter
     and applause from audience.)

     Any rate, I used to, I used to call, uh, since I had a bad experience with
     legalism and all this other stuff, uh, churchianic stuff, you know, you're
     going to church and be like, boy if you, in some churches if you get up and




                                                                            2375

     you say PRAISE THE LORD! and you really feel it, they go ssshhhh!  Now wait
     a second!  You're supposed to worship the Lord with a SHOUT!  THAT'S THE
     WAY THEY DID IT IN THE BIBLE!  IT'S ALL OVER THE BIBLE!  It even says Jesus
     is coming back with a shout!  IT TELLS YOU HOW TO WORSHIP THE LORD WITH A
     SHOUT IN HIS HOUSE.  SO LET THE WALLS OF THE TEMPLES SHAKE TO LET SATAN
     KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE!  DON'T GIVE HIM AN INCH, SAINTS, DON'T GIVE HIM AN
     INCH. Cause you give him an inch he'll take your life.  He'll take your
     life.  That's a fact.

     So I used to monitor what I used to call these right wing fundamentalist
     preachers.  These, these preachers who'd deny us our rights.  These free-
     flowing Pagans to worship the Mother Goddess ... and the God   and to hug
     on trees.  You know, man, when I look back I, I'm surprised I didn't go
     into a health food store and say, "Uh, yeah, dude, uh, I'll order a bowl of
     dirt and a side to tree bark, man."  And it was really wild.  I was
     twisted!  But I was teaching a lot of people.  A lot of people.  I sowed a
     lot bad seed and I pray for a crop failure, oh, Father, I pray for a crop
     failure!  Cause what you sow so shall you reap.  So I pray for that every
     day.  I'll get on my knees till they bleed if I have to.  I'll, I'll drop
     any time the Lord tells me to.

     So, any rate, I monitored all these preachers and one day I'm sittin in my
     office and I'm looking over all these radio show offers, I'm looking over
     the book offers, and believe me, I had a lot of book offers.  A lot of
     people wanted to know what I had to say about the realm of the occult,
     about  the realm of the darkness.  I was (unintelligible) riding a dark
     horse.  I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE WHITE HORSE WAS A BETTER RIDE!  A MUCH
     MORE POWERFUL RIDE! (Cheers from audience.)  And isn't that quite a
     coincidence that our Lord Jesus Christ is comin in on a white horse?  With
     a sword, I might add.  And I'm glad I'm not on the receiving end, I'm
     tellin you that much.

     So any rate, my wife comes in, he he, she comes running into the temple and
     she's got this article and she knows I used to give fire and brimstone
     ceremonies to the Pagans (unintelligible.)  I'm tellin ya, I was so messed
     up it was unreal.  I wish I had some of the tapes but we burnt up the
     temple.  Oh well.  But she comes running into the office as white as a
     ghost cause she knew this would get me really upset.  And the article said
     this is  about Larry Lea, the article said "God's Green Berets are comin in
     to San Francisco to exorcise it of demons, of the demons of prayer, uh,
     perversion, of witchcraft, of greed, and all these spirits, right?"

     I said how DARE this man blasphemy Halloween!  A HOLY DAY!  Holy smoke was
     I wrong!  I was big time wrong!  But I got angry.  And don't you ever
     believe that Satan's troopers are not organized.  Oh, we have doctors, we
     have lawyers.  There are actually surgeons that are Satanists!  We've got
     one in the military that's a lieutenant colonel.  And they're out there. 
     And they're operating on you!  What happens if one of their talismans falls
     off into your gut?  One of their medallions or something?  Whew!  Ugh!  Ohh
     that gives me goosebumps just to think about it!

     So, I got really fired up and throughout the computer network I told all
     the
     different pagans, all the covens, which is a group and groves which is an
     even, a coven is 13, a grove is larger than 13.  I founded New Earth
     Temple,
     uh, New Earth Fellowship of Mankind in '83 and it's so big I don't even
     know how many people there are in it anymore.  I just, just, just disowned




                                                                            2376

     it.  And I pray every day that they'll come to know the Lord Jesus Christ
     (Amens from audience.)

     And uh, I came out here and founded the New Earth Temple, which is like a
     little sister satellite.  Put it under the same charter and, uh, I started
     sending out the battle cry.  "Here was another Jim Jones coming into town.
     The witch trials were gonna start.  Cotton Mathers revisited.  I can see it
     now.  Here it comes.  They're gonna break out the witch burning stakes and
     they're gonna kill the homosexuals.  They're gonna kill the poor, they're
     gonna kill the witches; they're gonna kill the wizards and the sorcerers
     and the warlocks.  In the Bible it says suffer not a witch to live and all
     this stuff."

     And I said "Oh Lord!"  And I didn't use quite that word, I said "Oh my
     God," and God was listening to me. He said, "yeah, Eric, I got a plan for
     you.  Wait till you see this one!"  But I didn't know it.  I did not know
     it.  So yeah, the battle cry.  And I got a lot of response.  And along with
     my temple, I got in touch with all the gay rights activists, the civil
     rights activists, cause it was a political issue at first.  To me it was
     like, "how dare you come into San Francisco wearing combat fatigues talking
     about seizing it by force which is rightfully ours?  I'm thinking what
     the... what's this guy  talking on?  This is my temple.  You're not seizing
     my temple."  You know?  I didn't know what they were talking about, I was
     just reading the newspaper accounts.

     So, the day before I got everybody all fired up and news started coming out
     of the woodwork.  We were on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, we
     were in the USA Today, CNN, every news station.  I mean I saw the news
     printout.  This went as far as Australia and Sweden.  The printout would go
     back and forth against this, uh, uh, uh, across this room several times.
     I've got stacks of articles.  The whole world knew about this.

     And I'm thinking, yeah, right.  Alright, the Pagans are gonna finally uh,
     be able to voice what they have to voice, that they're an oppressed people. 
     Little did I know that Christian are even more oppressed because of who
     they are.  And the Strongman, we were doing the Strongman's work.  And he's
     out there to do us down and dirty every time to each and every quarter
     that's what he's gonna try to do.

     So, I wound up doing a show called "People are Talking."  I had spies in
     the Christian church.  Since I had a temple I had to know what the Chris-
     tians were up to.  So I just had spies go into Pastor Dave Bernal's church
     and Jubilee Christian Center.  And I was just trying to figure out the way
     that I could drop this man like Jimmy Swaggart, who I had occasion to meet
     Jimmy Swaggart.  And I was seeing that happen.

     When I was doing "People Are Talking", they put all the makeup on me and
     stuff in the makeup chair.  And I heard that Dick Bernal had just walked
     in.  And I said, "well, this guy's gonna break out a witch burning stake
     and this is gonna be it.   We're gonna go to blows."  Well, I'm tellin you
     something, he was the sweetest, most loving transparent man I have ever met
     in my life.  And he just loved on me.  He talked to me.  He talked to me.
     Man to man.  I found out that we had a lot in common.  And his wife, Carla,
     who's got that that, that that tenacity, that pit bull like tenacity kept
     after me about how much God loved me.  And I'm like "Get away I've got a
     show to do - for the dark side.  But I'm right and you're wrong.  I don't
     know what you people are."  That, that, that love was imparted on me.




                                                                            2377

     So, he said, uh, after the show, this was going to have some coffee.  And
     he said "you, you're, you're going uh, to the uh, crusade?"  And I said,
     "yeah, but I'm gonna have to go in disguise cause they published in the
     newspaper I was coming there to disrupt the crusade."  He said "Why don't
     you be my honored guest?"  I said "what in the?  That's one good way of
     getting in."  See, cause I had planned that if Larry Lea said one thing
     racist, elitist, bigoted, not a Christian - don't think I didn't know what
     Christianity was all about cause I even said on the news "If they truly are
     Christian, they'll welcome me with open arms" just like Jesus Christ
     welcomes each and every one of you with open arms.  And Lord have mercy,
     they sure did.

     But, I took a gun with me.  I had it in my boot and I figured, "if this
     preacher gets out of line and starts with the witch burnings, I'm gonna
     shoot this man.  Even if I have to lose my life or whatever or go to jail,
     I'll shoot him."  Because occultists believe just as strongly, a Satanist
     believes just as strongly, about what he's doing as a Christian does about
     their belief.  Some of those really don't care. They even have some of them
     so deceived they don't even know.  They don't know what to believe in, so
     they'll worship a desk.  And there are people that do that.  There are
     people that worship inanimate objects all the time.

     So, what happened, the day before the crusade we had a circle and it was
     supposed to be a circle, like a service, to bind up and cast down.
     Interestingly enough, we were using the same words, that's how you know
     when they say that the Devil will use palid half-truths that will sound
     almost right?  Sounded almost right to me.  It sounded right to me,
     actually.  Actually, the circle in on the videotape.  And we got these
     Pagans together and there was uh a little bit more than 75 it was more like
     a few hundred just at the day, the circle the day before.  That didn't
     include the army we had for the next day.  Ha ha.  We had a surprise
     coming.  We were gonna go to war.

     And I'll tell you what happened.  We had our circle.  It started out to be
     a binding.  We figured if any negative energy that was gonna come along
     with this guy Larry Lea onto the people because we knew the power of
     prayer.  We knew about the power of prayer.  Now Witches have their own
     version of prayer.  THERE IS POOWER IN WORDS!  THAT'S WHY THE LORD WANTS
     YOU TO SHOUT!  And sometimes it takes shouting to wake up the dead!

     So.  We had our circle.  And things got out of hand, it just  haha, whew
     boy did it get out of hand!  Well, what happened was it started out to be a
     simple enough binding circle we'd keep the energy in there and nobody
     getting hurt and we could get (unintelligible.)  In the news just your
     basic Pagan ritual in downtown San Francisco.  Sounds a little bit like
     Soddom and Gomorrah to me, I don't know about you guys but's its an
     understatement for San Francisco.  Unfortunately - you guys do a lot of
     praying for them there.  By the way, let me tell you something, Colorado is
     a hornet's nest.  You guys may or may not be aware of it.  They're just not
     as blatant about it here.  But they're there.  They're watching me.  They
     know I'm here.  AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE NOT IN HERE!  Well great.  Because
     every chance I get I'll pull down the devil's pants and kick him in the
     tail. (Applause from audience.)

     Well, what I was gonna say, we pulled up.  We pulled up in the car and I
     got out.  I was the first one out of the car.  Pastor said, he said Eric
     you go out first he, he.  They're your people and they're a real ugly
     looking crowd.  Believe me they were an ugly looking crowd.  There was




                                                                            2378

     thousands of them there.  There was more like 5,000 of them there.  And
     they were all dressed like Freddy Krueger.  Some of them were wearing their
     whole Satanic garb.  The Witches were wearing their white Witch garb.  How
     many of you know there's no such thing between a white Witch and a black
     Witch?  It's all the Satan.  Some it's just a little bit sweeter tasting. 
     A little bit more deceptive.  It's all the same.

     So, I got out of the car first.  When I got out of the car, they started to
     step out and the crowd just ROARED.  They were so happy to see me.  Cause
     they knew that the High Priest of New Earth Temple, a man who spearheaded
     and threw all this stuff together was gonna go in there and disrupt the
     crusade.  Then Dick Bernal gets out of the car.  Then they were really
     confused.  The roar just like instantly stopped and they looked like, huh?
     And so Dick Bernal, wearing his casual double-breasted suit, huh,
     (unintelligible)

     It was really funny.  I'm a totally different person now.  And when you see
     the tape you can see.  You know, the Lord did this in just a couple of
     months time too.  WHICH IS EVEN MORE AMAZING!  GOD STILL WORKS MIRACLES!
     AND HE EVEN HAD THE SECULAR MEDIA THERE TO DOCUMENT IT AND HE HAD THE
     CHRISTIAN MEDIA THERE TO DOCUMENT IT AND THEY PUT IT ON THIS TAPE SO THAT
     HE COULD SAY "THE DEVIL IS A LIAR"! (Applause and cheers from audience) 
     AND I'S ON TAPE!  WE GOT IT ON TAPE!  And we got it on tape.  Devil you are
     a liar.  We got you with your pants down now!  And I'll tell you, he
     doesn't even want this tape out.  Pastor, Pastor Cordova will tell you what
     we went through gettin these tapes here.  Unbelievable.  These tapes are so
     hard to keep in stock it's.... he doesn't want it.  He doesn't want his
     pants pulled down.  Maybe because there's no genitalia there or nothing.  I
     don't know (laughter from audience).  Who knows!

     But I'll tell you something, I walked through the crowd and as I walked
     through the crowd, I could feel.  You know how you can just feel when
     someone doesn't like you?  I'll tell you somethin, I, I felt hatred.  I
     felt anger.  Matter of fact, you'll see one young man on the tape saying
     "We're coming here to hate the Christians."  Literally we're coming here to
     be hateful.  I really didn't want to hate anybody, I just didn't want any
     of this, this, (unintelligible) stuff on me.  That's all.  That's all. 
     Plus I wanted to hear the other side of the story.  There's two sides to
     every coin.  Ha.. There's the dark and there's the light.  There's those
     that know Jesus, and those that don't.  It's that simple.  Ha.  It's really
     that simple.

     So what happened was I walked into the auditorium and I felt behind my back
     I could feel like a...kinda like if you've ever been uh, uh, body surfing
     in the ocean you've got that rush that just pushes you along, kinda felt
     that rushing, pushing, hateful energy on my back.  And I looked over my
     shoulder and I could see through the glass doors and the barriers and the
     riot police with all his combat gear on all these people and they looked so
     diseased and so sick.  Half of them had AIDS.  The other half was just
     totally had blown minds.  All doped up, smoked up and choked up.  They were
     out there and they were saying some of the most disgusting things I ever
     heard.  And they were throwing ripe fruit at the Christians and eggs and
     they were being physically violent.  As a matter of fact, I saw one young
     girl get kicked in the back.  She couldn't have been any older than 8 or 9
     years old.  They ripped her coat off of her.  And not one Christian, not
     one spirit-filled Christian took a Bible and threw it back at em.  And how
     many of you know how heavy a Bible can be?  It can be a pretty formidable




                                                                            2379

     weapon if you want to use it in a carnal way.  BUT IT'S AN EVEN MORE
     POWERFUL WEAPON WHEN YOU USE IT AS A SWORD!  (Applause from audience.)

     So, not one Christian, not one Christian threw a Bible.  Not one Christian
     goaded anybody on.  And they forged through in and when I looked over my
     shoulder and I saw all that, I immediately felt ... my heart broke.  I
     looked over my shoulder and I said "My God, am I responsible for that?  Yep
     you sure are, Brother.  You're the one who ha ha got everybody crazy, yeah,
     you're responsible for that.  If someone gets hurt of killed, it's on you,
     Brother.  And I thought, whew, blah."  But when I looked in the auditorium
     through the doors, I felt something else.  I felt love coming out of
     there.  But it wasn't, it, I, I, I didn't really , it didn't read across at
     first as love.  It was just something different.  Something that I wanted
     to run to.  I was drawn to it.

     And when I went in there, people who I would normally find ugly and
     disgusting and aesthetically not pleasing to an eye, and I'm an artist, I
     made some good money in the art world, people that I would normally find 
     ugly, people that I would walk up and say "did anybody ever tell you you
     are UGLY!"  Well I'm telling you something, man I mean I was really a nasty
     person, too, sometimes, and , uh, but now I'm nasty for the Lord when it
     comes to Satan.  So any rate, I, all these people looked beautiful.  It was
     like they were glowing.  Like, I don't know how to explain it.  It was
     amazing.  And so I went in there and then expected the typical "Gee
     Brother, God loves you.  Here's a Bible tract." and walk on.  "Have you
     heard the word of God lately."  "Yeah, I'll send him a postcard.  I'll call
     him."  That was all I expected.  I expected a bunch of crazed Christians to
     sing a bunch of songs, whoop and holler for a little while and tell me
     about how much God loved me, and that would be it.

     There was something special about these Christians.  These Christians were
     filled with the Holy Ghost, and they had LOVE!  AND GOD IS LOVE!  THAT
     MEANT THEY HAD GOD IN THEIR HEARTS!  AND THAT'S WHAT WON ME OVER!  But it
     was a battle!  Oh the Strongman worked hard!  He worked overtime on me to
     keep me from coming back to the Father.  Maybe I wasn't even in the
     kingdom, I don't know.

     BUT I KNOW NOW!  And I'll tell you something, I see the twinkle in their
     eyes and you know when the music started they all swaying and getting into
     the spirit there, hands were going up and they're speaking in tongues and
     all this, and I said "What do you people do?  Drop acid and drink and get
     high and then come to a prayer meeting?  What is going on here?"

     So I did my best.  "I am the High Priest of New Earth Temple, Reverend Dr.
     Eric J. Pryor.  I will maintain at ALL times."  And I'll tell you, I kept
     on feeling the Holy Ghost and I'm tell you that when they started singing
     "CALLING DOWN FIRE" man, they were singing that song bigtime, I'll never
     forget it.  It's my theme song now, I love it I can't stop singing it.
     Cause I know what it means now!  CALLING DOWN THE HOLY SPIRIT!  And I'll
     tell you, my foot started going and I said "Nope!"  Can't dance.  No. I'm a
     High Priest, I'm a High Priest.  Had my collar on, my pentacle and
     everything.

     All the Christians are looking at me like this, but they were loving on
     me.  They were loving on me.  And the music kept on going and my hand
     started.  "Nope, Nope, Nope!  Man if the media gets one shot of you,
     Brother, you're career is over.  You have no more power.  Those 20,000,
     50,000 Pagans.  Forget it!"  So I maintained pretty much a parade rest like




                                                                            2380

     attitude.  You can see that in the video.  But I was fighting the Holy
     Ghost.  The Holy Ghost was saying, "Hey, Eric, I want to love on you.  I
     want to be inside you man.  I want to work through you.  I LOVE YOU!  I
     LOVE YOU!"  And I didn't know that.  And I stood there and I'm telling you
     something, it was a battle like I've never, ever felt in my heart.

     So, the first night, man, I'll tell you something, I, I, I walked out and I
     was. I was in a daze.  I was in a trance.  I, I, I thought maybe they had
     developed some kind of subliminal laser technology or brainwashing. Maybe I
     was being emotionally......

     (Some lost due to turning the tape)

     ...and say "Be Healed"!  In whose name was I healing 'em?  Not the Lord's,
     he he, the Strongman had me deceived and the doctors deceived me too.  So I
     loved it.  Well, David Bremmer, Pastor Bernal and Carla and me, we slipped
     out through a side door.  They threw tear gas grenades at us.  We slipped
     out through the side door and everybody's choking on the tear gas and I've
     been in so many riots in San Francisco it's like, "Hey, oxygen, you know."
     So, I came out the side door, man and we went walking through the park.
     All... already there's a homeless dude in the park "Hey, Eric, what's up
     man?  You coming to the park Monday?"

     "Yeah, I'll be there, no sweat."

     "Hey, good going.  Yeah, you give those Christians hell."

     Huh.  Satan was giving him hell, not the Christians.  So what happened was
     while they walked in front of me, I furtively reached in my boot and I
     threw the automatic in the garbage pail and I said "Nah I don't want to
     hurt this man Larry Lea because everything that this man said I could agree
     with.  So there was a blackout.  The media blackout.  The media was at my
     door all the time.  They wanted to know what I thought about this.

     I went home and I was, I was changed already, but I didn't know that.  And
     my wife, I'm laying down in the bed kinda like this (rigid posture).  My
     wife said to me "Well how was it?"

     "Don't ask!"

     I went in that temple room and how many of you know that when there is
     really heavy duty demonic presence it's like a refrigerator?  It's like a
     refrig, it's cold.  Well the temple became cold.  Everything, everything
     lost its glint, it's glitter, it's, it's, it's    the fascination was all
     gone!  It was a hollow place!  I was practicing what they technically call
     the Olde Religion and what do you do to old things?  You bury them.  It's a
     dead religion.  And that's exactly what it was was a religion it had
     nothing to do with God.  It was man made.  It was an Adamism.

     So, I lay in bed that night, I, I didn't get any sleep.  Just like I
     haven't gotten any sleep since I got to Colorado.  (Laughter from aud-
     ience.)  Well, now, I did get a little today.  About 5 minutes.

     So any rate, well, running on the Holy Ghost, you know.  A little coffee
     every now and then doesn't hurt either.  So, uh, I laid there in bed all
     night and uh, my wife she, she, she slept pretty well, but she kinda felt
     funny too.  And, and I said to her, this was the next day for the crusade
     and I was invited back.  I had a VIP seat.  Boy they really had me.  The




                                                                            2381

     Christians are really tricky when they want to reel one in, especially the
     big fish.  "Give em a VIP seat.  Make im think he's important.  Put his
     name on it.  Yes, and call him doctor even though he's a befuddled Satan-
     ist.  Yes, Dr. Pryor, here's your seat."  Stoked my ego bigtime.  How many
     of you know that Satan's got a bigtime ego and so do his soldiers?  You
     know what I'm saying?  So, you know, I took the bait.  The Lord gave you
     just the bait to use.

     So I said the second day I said to my wife, "Look," well, she's now my
     wife.  She wasn't my wife before but uh Pastor Dick Bernal married us by
     the way.  I AM NOW A MARRIED MAN!  IN THE EYES OF THE LORD!  (applause from
     audience)  She couldn't come on this trip, but when I come back, I'm gonna
     bring her.  She's got an interesting story to tell too.  As a matter of
     fact, she's in the tape too.  And uh, so then, my wife's a scientist.
     Secular scientist.  Very well educated.  You know I'm kinda stupid compared
     to her.

     I said, "Look, Sondra, you're gonna have to come with me and help me figure
     this out because they think... they're doin somethin there, and you can
     feel it.  Boy if you could bottle it and sell it, you'd get rich."  How
     many of you recognize that story from somewhere in the Bible?  Uh...lemme
     see now, if memory serves me correctly, it might have been one of my
     ancient ancestors by the name of Simon, when I was practicing.  I'm no
     longer a practicing occultist.  Simon tried to buy this and bottle it.  And
     that's exactly what I thought I might be able to do, walk away with some of
     that. Restore the energy in here and use it.

     So I brought her with me the second day.  And I said, "And whatever you do,
     do NOT become born again.  If you come back here born again, you're out of
     here!  You can't be THE Priestess of no New Earth Temple if you're a born
     again Christian!"  hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite, cause I knew something
     about Jesus Christ.  I just knew it was real.  I just didn't know about the
     Holy Spirit.  I didn't know that the Holy Spirit is that which not only uh,
     uh helps you do things that you can not only, can not only do, it helps you
     with preparation when you're reading the Word and all that other stuff, but
     that the Holy Spirit is what helps you walk a Christian walk, WHICH IS A
     VERY VERY NARROW WALK!  BUT SATAN'S IS WIDE, REAL WIDE, and you can fall
     into the darkness so easy, so so easy.

     So any rate, I told her, I said, "Don't you come back born again on me."
     And this time, (unintelligible).  Every now and then, you know, the music
     would be going and everybody'd by "calling down fire" and all these
     beautiful songs.  First of all, I never really listened to much music
     except to Pagan drumming, or Pagan flute playing, or whatever, and, and I
     LIKED this music!  And you know I started to notice something.  Like, for
     instance, the Christian band looked like Motley Crue!  Half of them were
     glowing and had long hair and stuff and I said "Wait a second.  This is
     kinda messed up here.  Aren't Christians supposed to have short hair?"
     Christians with EARRINGS in, wearing bizzarre -- don't they all wear, like
     black mortician's suits and have short hair and drive big cars and go to
     barbeques on Sunday and talk about "How great was your game of golf,
     George?  "I shot three under par.  What did you shoot?  "Ah, I got a double
     eagle today."  I played golf today.  But I played it in the spirit!  And I
     pray in tongues when I play golf.  I'm not a bad golfer for someone who's
     only into golf for a couple of months.

     So any rate, I said to her, "Don't you come back born again." So we're
     listening to the music and everybody's swaying and Carla's getting drunk in




                                                                            2382

     the spirit again and everyone tried to figure out WHAT IS THIS!  We felt it
     too, though.  So I mean, we literally looked, you know, like at the
     fixtures to see if there was some kind of laser technology in there.  Maybe
     there's something underneath the seats.

     One of the funny things that was happened is I never really eat candy. 
     I'll have a little bit of coffee with my sugar and I'm sure Pastor Cordova
     and Pastor Bryan over here will bear witness to that, but I don't really
     eat candy.  Just never really, lost the taste for it somewhere along the
     line they had these body guards up there for me and this one body guard,
     Jerry Hill, boy God bless him, he was the head usher, he is the head usher
     at Jubilee, kept on going "here, you want some candy? want some candy?" 
     And I'm thinking "These stupid Christians.  They think they can buy me off
     with a lunch, a couple of cups of coffee, and candy?  Ah how simple-minded
     they are!  What a bunch of fools!  I'm gonna take 'em for a ride!"  What I
     didn't know is that it was sanctified candy.  (laughter from audience)  IT
     HAD BEEN PRAYED OVER.  AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHY I WAS EATIN' SO MUCH OF IT. 
     IT TASTED SO GOOD!  SEE, IT TASTES THAT THE LORD IS GOOD!  (Applause from
     audience.) And the Lord is good.

     So, Sondra and I are eating all this candy, and the music's going and I
     kept on going "Nope, can't dance."  And I had to stomp on my wife's foot
     every now and then make sure she wouldn't dance.  "Now Quit it!" you know? 
     So, that night Pastor Bernal took us home and Pastor Bremmer, and he said
     "look, uh, you know, I'm, I'm leaving for Hawaii.  I gotta be in Hawaii,
     but Pastor David Bremmer, my associate pastor, it comes to mind, I didn't
     like this guy I call him PRESTO PASTOR, cause he's so SPARKY! and the guy
     is just enjoying the Lord, man, this guy fasts 40 days every year.  He's
     amazing, you know.  And I really grew a love for these people.  You know, I
     normally didn't , I NORMALLY never got close to anybody, but I loved these
     people cause they were loving ME!  GOD WAS IN THEM!  GOD WAS LOVING ON ME
     THROUGH THESEPEOPLE, just like you should be loving in the world out there,
     so that youcan bring them in!  That's the bait, LOVE!  Cause God is Love! 
     SO USE GODAS THE BAIT  Let it flow through you!So what happened.  Pastor
     Dick went to Hawaii and I thought "Well, never seehim again.  It's been
     nice.  Got a couple of free meals out of him, but Istill don't know what's
     happening with these Christians.  I agree with whatthey're saying, but I
     think it may be Silvia(sic) Mind Control.  Maybe theyah, are in cahoots
     with Ron L. Hubbard or something, or EST or who knows?"But I still kept on
     feeling that feeling!  IT WASN'T IN THE HEAD, IT WAS INTHE HEART!  THERE'S
     A BIG DIFFERENCE!  Satan works on the head.  He can'tget in the heart if
     there's light in there.  And, boy, you could see itthrough the Christians,
     you could see Christians on fire for the Lord causeyou can see it in their
     eyes.  And, you know, they say that they eyes arethe windows of the soul,
     or a mirror, or whatever.  That's true, man, youcan see God.  A true,
     spirit-filled, full gospel Christian, you can see it.So, what happened?  I
     went back the last night.  This was the night of thetest.  The same thing
     happened all over again, calling down fire and "I amDoctor Eric J. Pryor,
     Reverend Minister, High Priest of New Earth Temple, Iam in FULL control.  I
     AM in full, full, full control.  I am. Stop it!  I amin full control."  And
     that's what the last night was like.  But, uh, whathappened was, Sondra and
     I went home, well, what, before that, I said, "let's put there magick to
     the test."  That's what we called it, gettingslain in the spirit in the
     Holy Spirit and laying on hands.  I called thatmagick.  That's what
     occultists do.  You see the same thing.  I used to beable to go like that
     AND knock people down ten feet away.  I used to gowhew! like that and
     they'd go right down.  Ha, I don't know what I wasslayin' em in, but I was
     slayin' em in somethin'.  Like mud, you know?So what happened?  She had a




                                                                            2383

     headache that day, really bad.  She suffersfrom migraine headaches and she
     had a runny nose.  So, I said to her, eachnight they put out an altar call
     for healing.  And I said, "OK, let's putthis Christian magick to the test". 
     So I said, "YOU go up and get healed.We'll use you as a guinea pig.  I'll
     just go up, kinda behind you."  Ha haha.  They laid hands on her, but
     everybody went on me like this!  And theywere praying and they were praying
     and they were praying and I was going.  Imean the Holy Ghost was going
     through me bigtime.  They just kept on lovingon me.  And I'll tell you, I
     walked out of there knock-kneed; floating onwho knows what?  I know now,
     the Holy Ghost.  Ha ha.  By impartation.And I went home that night.  Sondra
     and I were laying down in bed togetherand this time our house was like, I
     was expecting icicles to start you know,forming on the roof of the house,
     and, uh, she said, uh, "Do you feel it?"I said "Yeah".  She said "Can you
     sleep?"  I said "no".  I said, "Can yousleep?"  She said "no".  So "Well,
     what are we going to do?"  "I don'tknow".  And we just laid there.We just
     laid there and they all went back to Jubilee.  Our Christian friendswe,
     well they said, "well, when we get back,"  Pastor said "when we getback,
     we'll invite you down to Jubilee."  So, I called up Jubilee.  It was,h, uh,
     I think it was on a Saturday and I got their answering machine.  AndI think
     well, uh, Saturday or Sunday.  Yeah, it was a Sunday cause I thoughtthey
     would answer the phone at church.  I got their answering machine said"Wel-
     come to the Jubilee Christian Center if you know the extension numberpush
     the button now."  AND I FELT THE SPIRIT, THE HOLY GHOST OVER THE PHONETH-
     ROUGH AN ANSWERING MACHINE!  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!  AND I SAID WHOA!THIS
     IS GOOD!  For a couple of weeks, until I got a chance to go back toJubilee
     I used to just call up and listen to that voice, and I feltbetter.  And I'd
     pass the phone back and forth to Sondra.  We got a BIGphone bill!  Who
     cares?  It felt great!So they sent us up, they put us up.  Actually, before
     that, I gotta tellyou, I had a meeting with Larry Lea.  Before the third
     night early in themorning.  Larry Lea never talks to anybody during the
     crusades.  He's alwaysin prayer.  This brother's a big time prayer.  You
     know, he prays and heobeys.  I do the same thing.  Pray and obey.  That's
     it!  That's all thereis to it.And I'll tell you somethin', Dick Bernal
     calls me up first thing in themorning last night of the crusade and says
     "Hey, Eric, Larry Lea wants tomeet you.  He's got a burden on his heart." 
     And I'm saying, "OK, this is mywarning.  I know it.  They got the witch
     burning stake in back of theroom.  They got a limo or a Rolls or something. 
     Yeah, that's it, yeah.Those money-making Christians with witch burning
     stakes.  Hypocrites!"  Nah, nothing like that.  They brought me over there,
     went into this little roomand there was Larry.  Kinda like that.  And, uh,
     we sat in his makeup roomand boy, I'll tell you, he was the most humble man
     I had ever met.  And thetwinkle in his beautiful blue eyes and that smile. 
     And I, I used to, I, Icouldn't even stand a Texan, Texas accent.  But he,
     everybody in Texasaccent I always wanted to punch for some reason, You
     know?  And he had thisTexas accent, and, and I loved it!And I'd (unintel-
     ligible) that things were working so great that I, ha, hereI am, High
     Priest of New Earth Temple.  I hadn't made my decision yet, but Iknew that
     it was eventually coming.  Something was comin' anyway.  PastorDick Bernal
     was sitting next to me and, uh, uh, Larry said, "Do you mind ifI, if I tape
     this?"  And I looked up and I said "Pastor Dick, what do youthink?"  Little
     did I know, I'd be calling him "Pastor Dick" and sharing hisoffice with him
     at Jubilee!  It's incredible, I mean, things happen, right?So Larry says to
     me, he says "Eric, can we talk?"  We shared about outbackgrounds and he
     said "Eric, look."  He said, "I can see in your heartthat you're a man
     who's truly seeking the truth."  And he said "Seek and yeshall find." and
     wrote Matthew 7:7 in my Prayer Warrior Bible, which I justrecently gave
     away to a man who's a spirit filled Christian who's gone overto the Middle
     East, and I said "Look, I know Larry Lea sent 79,000 of thoseover there to




                                                                            2384

     the Middle East.  You show them this Prayer Warrior Bible andyou tell them
     it's from Eric Pryor a man who went from Pagan to Pentecostand I bear
     witness to Larry Lea and his ministry and what a wonderful thinghe's doing. 
     You go out there and you witness on the field.  You just bringthis Bible
     with you.  Maybe it'll stop a bullet, I don't know."  (applausefrom
     audience.)So what happened?  Uh, he said to me, "Eric, I'm not here to make
     a convertout of you.  Only the Holy Spirit can convict you."  So what I did
     was Isaid to him, "Look, all I'm interested in is the truth and if the
     truth be abucket of water, I'll drink it."  He caught that on camera.  The
     Lorddocumented all of this, it's amazing!  He said "I want an air-tight
     witnessso we can really kick Satan where it hurts."So what happened was, I
     went to Jubilee.  They put me up in a hotel room fora couple of nights and
     gave me a chance to rest and the next day I went toJubilee.  Now I knew
     that alot of other people knew that I was pallingaround with Dick Bernal,
     and I knew that they'd know what was up and Iwasn't talking to anybody
     because a battle was raging in my heart forweeks.  Before Dick Bernal came
     back there was a lapse of time.  And I wentto Jubilee Christian Center and
     I listened to the Pastor speak.  And onceagain I felt that feeling.  I felt
     that love of God.  They prayed, theyyelled before the Lord, they sang songs
     of praises.  I felt it in my heartonce again and I could see it in all
     their eyes again and I said "I wantthat."And I could see alot of people
     from New Earth Temple and other temples Iwent to in that audience.  I was
     pretty nervous.  I was afraid of abullet.  How many of you know "no one who
     comes against you shallprosper?"  I didn't travel up here with body guards
     this time.  I do sometimes.  And so any rate, they had an altar call.  And
     he looked at me.He had me right in the front row once again, where all eyes
     were upon me,he, he, he.  And he had an altar call.  And I felt, I felt the
     Spirit of theLord call me.  He said, "Eric, come to me.  I love you.  I
     LOVE YOU!"  Justlike he LOVES each and every one of you.  He even loves the
     sinner.  He justwants that sinner to come to him.  So I got up and I
     rededicated my life tothe Lord and I repented.  And I immediately, I had
     no(unintelligible) theBook of Acts, I didn't know about this, but I
     immediately in the back roomsaid to the pastor, I said, "NEW EARTH TEMPLE
     MUST COME DOWN BY MY HAND!"I couldn't believe I said that, but I knew it. 
     And we took hundreds ofthousands, I mean the crystal collection alone was
     $60,000, other thingswere priceless museum quality pieces, we don't know
     how much value theywere, and book contracts and everything and we just went
     into New EarthTemple and uh, we videotaped this.  We've got this on the
     tape.  Talk aboutpoltergeist activity and the Exorcist, this was even
     worse.  I mean PastorBremmer was choked.  We thought he was gonna drop on
     us.The lights and the camera were on the same circuit.  The camera kept
     ongoing but the lights kept on going on and off.  Part of that footage
     theycouldn't use because I didn't have a re-cleaned-up mouth at the time,
     so Iwas using some very carnal language.  But we tore out the temple and
     weburnt it in front of Jubilee Christian Center in front of a several
     thousandpeople.  And, uh, the day of the burning the Strongman actually
     tried tostop it.  It started to rain a little.  And we're having a hard
     time withrain in California.  And it started to rain a little and we
     thought "Oh,we're not even going to be able to have our bonfire because of
     the rain."But it didn't rain.  There was just dark clouds over Jubilee.And
     we burnt down New Earth Temple and it all went up.  And the fire was sohot
     and you'll probable see things like this.  One box in one of the uh,fire
     pits that we couldn't burn.  It should go up like that.  It's made outof
     rosewood.  That cheap Indian stuff that should just go whoosh.  Itwouldn't
     burn because of the contents in it.  I mean it was amazing.  Thedumpster
     melted.  The dumpster.  The steel dumpster melted.  I mean that'show hot
     the fire was.  So New Earth Temple was no more and I tell you, Ifelt,
     whoosh, whoosh, all the stuff coming out of me.  I could not believeit. I




                                                                            2385

     was like.  Get out of the way!  It was just coming out of me.  Justsmashing
     everything up.  And I felt like I didn't even have any weight.  Ifelt like
     I was air.And after it was all over, all was said and done, and I'd
     rededicated mylife to the Lord, and I said, "Lord, I have nothing to offer
     you back.  Me,that's it, that's all I have.  And I'll get rid of New Earth
     Temple and Iwill pray and I will obey and I will magnify you and I will
     glorify you allmy days and I will try to impart the very love that you have
     shown me.  I'lltry to love on other people too, Lord.  And Lord, if you
     give me the chance,I'll go around, ALL AROUND THE WORLD PULLING DOWN
     SATAN'S PANTS.  I'LL DOIT!"So, as a result of watching Jubilee (unintel-
     ligible) a little bit oflunch.  As everybody knows these prayer warriors
     need to ear.  Man does notlive on air alone.  He lives on a little bit of
     the, you know this pastorcan bear witness to that.  Full Gospel.  So what
     happened was, uh, as wewere driving away, now this is really interesting,
     we had that dark blackcloud covering, and Carla and I were sitting in the
     back of the car and welooked over our shoulders, over at Jubilee and there
     was still dark cloudsexcepting right over Jubilee there was a hole in the
     sky and there werebrilliant, brilliant, brilliant sunlight shining on
     Jubilee.That year alone Jubilee grew 1,500 members.  We're into '91 and
     it's growinglike wildfire.  And you know why?  Because they're worshiping
     the Lord with shouts and there is no room for the spirit of religion. It's
     not all about "I've been a Christian longer than you, so I know more." 
     It's all about JESUS CHRIST, THE LIVING SON OF GOD! (APPLAUSE FROM AUD-
     IENCE)  AND THE HOLY SPIRIT AND ALL THE PROPHETS.  IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT
     SITTING ON THOSE PEWS WARMING 'EM.  IF I HAD A CHURCH, I'D TAKE THE PEWS
     OUT AND MAKE 'EM STAND!IT SAYS YOU SHALL SHOUT BEFORE THE LORD!  AND THAT'S
     WHAT WE DO!  THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GETTING SLAIN IN THE SPIRIT WITH
     DIGNITY.  WHEN YOU FALL YOU LOOK JUST AS STUPID AS EVERYBODY ELSE.  WHETHER
     YOU ARE WEARING A $600 SUIT OR A PAIR OF HAND-ME-DOWN JEANS.  WHEN YOU'RE
     SLAIN IN THE SPIRIT, YOU'RE SLAIN IN THE SPIRIT!  WHEN THE LORD WANTS YOU
     TO DO DOWN, YOU GO DOWN.  YOU PRAY AND YOU OBEY!  And you be humble before
     the Lord.  And I'll tell you what that Holy Spirit is moving through you
     and you got the whole armor of God upon you, let me tell you something,
     Brothers and Sisters, Dear ones, let me tell you something, you can do a
     mighty, mighty work!  YOU DON'T MESS WITH NO CHILD OF GOD!  (amens, etc.
     from audience.)  SATAN SEES THAT HOLY SPIRIT AND HE FLEES.  DEVIL GET OUT,
     AND HE MOVES!  HE MOVES BIGTIME cause he knows that the war has been won
     through our Lord Jesus Christ.When Jesus Christ died for us, and he saidhow
     heavy his heart must have been when he thought "Father, Father, whyhas't
     thou forsaken me?"  Who in their right mind would not fall to theirknees
     and go "oh, oh God, you gave your only begotten son so that I mighthave
     life everlasting!"  I am the father of two beautiful young boys and Idon't
     know if I could bear to see my kids nailed to a tree for people that I
     didn't even know, BUT GOD LOVES YOU THAT MUCH!  SO TAKE THAT PRECIOUS GIFT
     AND RUN WITH IT!  THERE ARE PROMISES AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD
     AND YOU TAKE THEM AND YOU RUN WITH THEM!A new church is being birthed here,
     people.  A CHURCH THAT IS GOING TO HONOR THE LORD GOD AMLIGHTY IN A BIG
     WAY!  AND IT'LL PRAISE HIM AND(unintelligible).  He knows.  He knows.  You
     shall worship the Lord with ashout and be humble before the Lord and know
     that it's not you.  It's Godworking through you.  And that the Lord doesn't
     need you, he doesn't needyou!  But he calls you and he will allow you to
     work for him.  My everyneed.  I haven't had (unintelligible).  I don't hold
     a secular job.  I comeout here on a wing and a prayer wondering whether or
     not I'll be shot.  Idon't know.  Take the red-eye flight at 4:30 in the
     morning I get in here, a couple of hours sleep and I'll do whatever the
     Lord wants me to becauseSatan's a LIAR!  AND I'M GONNA TELL PEOPLE ABOUT
     IT!  AND HE AIN'T GONNASTOP ME!  Not so long as I have the power and the
     authority through JesusChrist and the Holy Spirit running through me no

     way.  No way.  He cannot stop me.And I'll tell you, when I go I want to go
     with a shout of praise to theLord.  When I go from this world into the
     kingdom of heaven I want to be goABBA!  And he's gonna go WELL DONE, OH
     GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT!  AND HE'SGONNA WIPE THE TEARS FROM MY EYES!  AND
     I'M GONNA SIT ON A THRONE, AND I'MGONNA GET A CROWN!  BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, I
     AM AN HEIR, I AM A PRINCE becauseof Jesus Christ!  (amens, etc. from
     audience.)  And I've got the mostpowerful weapon in the world.  This
     (holding up a Bible) could make anuclear device look silly.  You can win a
     war with this.  You can win a warwith this.  And I'm tellin' you somethin',
     dear ones, we are not on thedefensive as Christians.  We are on the
     offense.  TO TAKE BACK WHAT'SRIGHTFULLY OURS!  WE ARE TO GAIN GROUND. 
     DON'T GIVE SATAN ONE INCH OR HE'LL TAKE A MILE, AND HE'LL TAKE YOU DOWN
     WITH HIM!  And he will, he will.  That brother upstairs blew his brains out
     and you should see what was on the kid's walls!  Slayer!  Van Halen!  Drug
     paraphernalia!  But, Praise God, his father's here tonight! (applause from
     audience!)I was at Bible Temple today, the Lord said, "Go out there and
     make disciples among men."  He didn't say go out there and make converts,
     but first you have to be converts.  First you have to accept the Lord. 
     Then you gotta go to a place where you can be discipled and taught the
     things of God, like I'm being taught.  And I'm so blessed.  Thank you
     Father!  Oh, I thank you Father for what you're doing to my life and what
     you're doing in all the saints' lives.  Cause I've surely been blessed
     because I know some really serious people in the Lord.Well, I know this
     brother here and I'm watching a church be birthed and, and I know that I
     was here, and and and I was over at Pastor Bryan's church, Bible Temple,
     this morning.  I'm so blessed.  I really felt so blessed.  You know, we
     went out and we had lunch and my motto is one a day for the Lord at least
     to keep my hand in the battle.  We were sittin there and the Holy Ghost
     said to me, "Eric, that waitress needs the lord."  Pastor Bryan, you want
     to come up here, Brother.  Why don't you tell them what happened?  Now this
     is the way the Holy, the Holy Spirit works.  The Holy Spirit put it on
     me.Now we're gonna be casting out oppression.  We're gonna be casting
     outdemons and we're gonna have an altar call for those of you who areback-
     slid.  The Lord'll take you back.  We're gonna have an altar call forall
     you who are oppressed.  We're gonna have an altar call for all of youwho
     are having children who have problems.  We'll lay hands on the parentsand
     by impartation you go home and you lay your hands on your kids.  Youwatch
     over your children.  You are stewards of your children.  We'll havethat
     altar call and be blessed by it.Don't miss that opportunity!  Cause, I'll
     tell you something, I might walkright out the door and they'll be rapture
     and I'll be gone.  He, he, he.  Ican't wait.  I'm having a hard time
     dealing with these cars and snow andcold and clothes.  But, Pastor Bryan,
     here he'll tell you.  Tell you how the Lord works.  The Lord puts it upon
     you real quick  Here's Pastor Bryan from Bible Temple.  Give this brother a
     big hand.  (applause from audience.) We're gonna help bring the spirit of
     revival BACK TO WJERE IOT BELONGS RIGHT HERE IN DENVER SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE
     SATAN (UNINTELLIGIBLE) (APPLAUSE FROM AUDIENCE).Before we have our altar
     call, and that is, none of the proceeds of thistape go to me.  All I'm
     interested in is sowing seed.  And I don't want toleave Colorado with a
     tape, and I'll tell you why.  You see, it's not onlywere they hard to get
     here, he, it was only by the grace of God that theygot here, believe me,
     but, uh, this is probably going to be one of the mostpowerful tools that
     you'll ever have.  Has anybody here seen this tapeyet?  Can anybody bear
     witness to what's on this tape?  It's a mighty,mighty tape.I mean this was
     God's work.  It's not my work, this is not Jubilee's work.This was God's
     work.  And I don't want to go home back to Jubilee with onetape.  I wanna
     know that you've got some more ammunition that you can showthe youth.  That
     you can show other people who are oppressed.  Just showthem the power of

     God's love, cause that's what I did.  I came face to facewith God's love. 
     And you know something?  The Lord turns all evil things to the good.  He
     did.  The secular media documented it as well.  One right up your flap,
     Satan!  And we got it all on tape, the whole thing.And hopefully, the Lord
     willing, if I can ever slow down for one second andget some sleep I'm gonna
     put the words.  I'm penning the scribe right now.The autobiography "From
     Pagan to Pentecost" which is meatier and will giveyou a little bit more. 
     And it'll also have some information in there as tohow you can do certain
     things to help your brothers and sisters out who need to know the Lord. 
     And with that, Dear Ones, I'm gonna hand you over to uh, a man who's who's
     fervent and mighty in this Spirit-filled church and this other brother here
     who's got a mighty mighty church in the Lord and these two brothers here,

                      TO WICCEN OR NOT TO WICCEN......
                              by Vivienne West

     Christians  "christen"  a  child  shortly  after  it comes into the
     world. Surely, then, it would make sense for Wiccans to "wiccen"  a
     child at the same age - or even earlier.

     I have an objection to the christening ceremony based on my  funda-
     mental belief in the right of the individual to make their own free
     choice.  The  christening ceremony, usually if not always performed
     on a person who is far too small to speak for themselves,  condemns
     the  child  to  at least nominal Christianity all their life. Their
     parents are sworn to raise the child as a Christian no  matter  how
     obviously  unhappy  that  makes their offspring, and statements are
     made in ritual about the actual belief-system of the child. This is
     abhorrent to me: no one should ever make binding  magical  promises
     (and  all  rituals, even Christian ones, are magical) about someone
     who cannot speak for  themselves  and  whose  preferences  are  not
     known.

     Now, I have read short articles in various Pagan magazines  in  the
     past  (one in particular I remember, but Murphy has got to my mind,
     so I can remember neither the title  nor  the  authors'  names)  in
     which people have laid out ritual events ar scripts that do exactly
     the  same  thing,  only  in Wiccan terms instead of Christian ones.
     This, too, even as a Wiccan, I  find  distasteful.  Once  again,  a
     person  (even  if  they  think  of  themself as a concerned, caring
     parent) is forcing their own belief-system and value-judgements  on
     someone who is too young and helpless to speak for themself.

     I  do  believe  in  celebrating the event of birth. Birth is a huge
     step:  it  is  a  statement  about  the  individual's   choice   of
     environment  and associates for up to the next hundred years or so.
     It marks the beginning of a period known  as  life,  in  which  the
     individual  is  offered  chances to grow and develop, as well as to
     experience pleasures and pain. Birth should be celebrated,  and  it
     is fitting to celebrate it in front of the Gods.

     But  even  as  a  part  of such celebration, do I have any right to
     insist that my infant child is going to grow up into being  Wiccan?
     Obviously,  as a Wiccan whose every aspect of life is influenced by




                                                                            2388

     my belief-system, I am going to teach my child about the Craft  and
     try  to instill a love of the Gods that I know and love. I am going
     to try to teach a love of the magical way of looking at the  world,
     as opposed to the boring old way everyone else looks at things. Yet
     if my offspring, while knowing all they can about the Craft, decide
     it  is  not for them and some other path (or no path at all) is the
     only right and fitting way to live their life, then that  is  their
     decision.  I  have  no  right, even at this early stage, to condemn
     them to a lifetime of Wicca, no matter what.

     On the other hand, though, as a caring parent I  have  every  right
     and  every emotional need to do whatever I can to protect and bless
     my child. I will definitely do a working  when  this  infant  I  am
     carrying  is  born. This will be along the lines of an introduction
     or presentation of my child to the Old Ones, and an asking of their
     blessing and protection on him/her. It will  not,  however,  be  an
     ceremony  formally  inducting  the  child into Wicca. That can wait
     until such time as he/she expresses an interest in initiation.

                  "Restoration" Christian Churches and Their Origins 
                                    Chris Anderson

      > Restorationists: you, mormons, armstrongites,
      > millerites, adventists, and other sects whose claim is
      > that the original true Gospel was lost or perverted over
      > time and that your sect has RESTORED it.

     Prior to the appearance of any of these there was yet a different
     "restorationist" movement whose doctrines were entirely familiar to
     mainline Protestantism.  Each of the above groups has been at odds with the
     doctrines of the mainline Protestants at one point or another.  Of the
     collection you mentioned above, only the Adventists (and at that, not their
     predecessors) hold to particularly orthodox positions.

     You'll find the original batch of "restoration churches" under the heading
     of a 'non-denomination' or two such as "_______ Church of Christ" and
     "_______ Christian Church".  BTW, the fellow up in La Porte, in spite of
     the name being used for his facility, is in no way related to these groups.

     Here's a brief summary of the whole concept:


     The following is a brief summary of the "Declaration and Address"
     that was written back in (I believe) 1904.  It was the first document that
     comprehensively issued the plea of the "Restoration Movement".  It is
     the closest thing that exists in the way of a "creed" for the various
     churches of the Restoration Movement.

     The "Restoration Movement" can be traced back to the late 1700's.  James
     O'Kelly, a Methodist in North Carolina, favored an independent,
     congregational form.  Abner Jones (Baptist, 1800-1803 time frame) called
     for the abandonment of human creeds.  J.A. Haidane in Edinburgh, Scotland
     (1798) had a substantial influence on Campbell (below) and called for the
     abandonment of "human innovations".  Alexander Carson (Tubemore, Ireland,
     1807) made a plea for the restoration of New Testament church practice.
     Barton W. Stone (Presbyterian, Kentucky) dumped the Calvinist thinking on
     predestination, and joined Campbell in 1831.  Thomas Campbell concluded
     that "closed communion" was invalid, and was 86'd by his denomination as a




                                                                            2389

     result.  He and Alexander Campbell authored the "Declaration and Address".

     The "Declaration and Address" contained thirteen propositions, summarized
     below:

       1) That the church of Christ is "essentially, intentionally
          and constitutionally one."

       2) That although this unity presupposes and permits the existence
          of separate congregations or societies, there should be perfect
          harmony and unity among all of them.

       3) That the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice of
          Christians.

       4) That the Old and New Testaments alone contain the authoritative
          constitution of the church of Christ.

       5) That no human authority has power to amend or change the
          original constitution and laws of the church.

       6) That inferences and deductions from the Scriptures, however
          valuable, can not be made binding upon the consciences of
          Christians.

       7) That differences of opinion with regard to such inferences
          shall not be made tests of fellowship or communion.

       8) That faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is a sufficient
          profession to entitle a man or woman to become a member of
          the church of Christ.

       9) That all who have made such a profession, and who manifest
          their sincerity by their conduct, should love each other as
          bretheren and as members of the same body and joint-heirs of
          the same inheritance.

      10) That division among Christians is antichristian, antiscriptural,
          unnatural and to be abhorred.

      11) That neglect of the revealed will of God and the introduction
          of human innovations are and have been the causes of all the
          corruptions and divisions that have ever taken place in the
          church of God.

      12) That all that is necessary to secure the highest state of
          purity and perfection in the church is to restore the original
          ordinances and constitution as exhibited in the New Testament.

      13) That any additions to the New Testament program which
          circumstances may seem to require, shall be regarded as human
          expedients and shall not be given a place of higher authority
          in the church than is permitted by the fallible character of
          their origin.

     I suppose I would say that theoretically any magic that can be worked
     with ritual and/or tools can also be done without.  The caveat with this
     is that most of us (self included) don't have the skills, knowledge
     and/or power to do without the ritual/tools for certain complicated
     powerful working, IMHO.  Though perhaps if we worked without tools or
     ritual more often we'd get better at it... ;)  Seriously, though, I'm
     not advocating dropping the tools or ritual --- they're useful.  And I
     think it's better to do what's useful than to work until you're ninety
     before you finally get good at it!

     SB>Tools sometimes mean much more than just a focus, more than just a

     You're speaking here of tools which carry energy or intelligence, I
     assume?  I was refering to tools which are made by the worker or by
     another worker for the purpose of someone else using them.  In my
     understanding tools are more useful if they carry energy or
     intelligence.  If they do, it's because the worker put it there.  I
     differentiate these from tools which acquire energy or intelligence
     through a process other than human intervention.

     It sounds to me like in that circumstance we are depriving ourselves of
     the opportunity to work with another intelligence. When you use the word
     "soul" I presume you mean "entity" as well, to which I attribute some
     level of intelligence.

     SB>fits into your definition of the use of tools to enhance personal power.

     Not tools.  The vesting of power and passing of knowledge is through (as
     I comprehend it currently) the partnership of human and deity.  As I see
     it, the process of initiation (which many workers use, including all of
     the shamanistic paths that I know anything about) does several things:
     1) charters the individual with membership in the group with all the
     rights and responsibilities involved thereof.  2) Passes power or
     knowledge from the initiator to the initiate (sometimes the power or
     knowledge is seen as coming from elsewhere, such as a deity).  3)
     Formally introduces the initiate to the energy and/or deities of the
     tradition.  4) Creates a new personality for the initiate which
     sometimes supplants the old one.  I'm sure there are points I've missed
     and not all initiations do all these things.

     SB>What is this personal power you use?  Certainly that power is from
     SB>within, utilizing nothing from without, if you deny the use of tools.

     Not necessarily or entirely; I don't consider the ambient power of the
     universe a "tool" per se.  I differentiate between energy and a tool.

     SB>What, precisely, is a tool?

     Good question!  Does this fall into the same kind of discussion as "what
     is a witch", perhaps? :)   IMHO a tool must be an object, either
     physical or an astral representation of a physical object.  If it's not
     an object, if it's an entity, energy, intelligence, spirit, or whatever,
     it's not a tool, it's a partner (or servant in some circles).

     SB>What, precisely, is personal power?

     I think of personal power as the ability to exercise one's abilities.
     To whatever degree you have the energy, skill and knowledge to do so,
     you have personal power. This includes the energy, skill and knowledge
     to draw on power from outside your physical/astral/whatever being.

     SB>Are the gods a tool, or power, and can we cast without them?

     The gods I deal with are real entities with minds, thoughts, feelings,
     histories and agendas of their own.  They aren't psychological
     constructs, or sheer power, or tools.  If by "cast" you mean what I mean
     by "work", I say yes.




                                                                            2392

     SB>Is inherented knowledge passed through the centuries personal power, or
     a
     SB>tool, and can we cast without it?

     I think of power as energy, but perhaps the power passed by initiation
     is both information and energy (thus including knowledge).  I conceive
     of the power of an inititiatory line (of whatever flavor) as a stream, a
     line of connection to which all members of that line, living and dead,
     connect.  We can draw on the knowledge and energy of the line, or we can
     work without it.  I don't think of it as exactly personal, as it belongs
     to everyone in the line.

     SB>Are the spirits that surrounds us a part of us and a power to be used,
     or
     SB>some seperate entity and a tool to be cast aside?

     Spirits are entities, as near as I can figure, and that makes them
     neither powers nor tools.  There's a difference, for example, between
     drawing on the energy of the moon and making a connection with the
     spirit of the moon.

     SB>At times, the definitions of tools and power become too intermixed
     SB>to seperate.  Perhaps, we are nothing without our tools.  Perhaps,
     SB>there really are no tools.  Perhaps, we are the tool.  I challenge
     SB>that what we are comes from without and that there is nothing that
     SB>we do today or any other that will increase or refine our power one
     SB>wit *unless* we reach outwards.  What we become will pass to the
     SB>generations.  What has been is within and a tool as surely as any
     SB>other.
     I have real difficulty accepting that all I am comes from without.
     That makes me too much defined by that which surrounds me, and binds me
     to be what the outside (parents, friends, society) says I am.  I don't
     believe I am a tool, even of my deities.  I do agree that without input
     from that which surrounds us, we don't have any opportunity for growth
     and development.  That is where connections are so important, and why it
     is so important for us to connect with that which nourishes us,
     rather than that which stunts or devours us.  What we pass to the
     generations depends on the quality of our lives and works.

                         Solitary Neophyte Ritual from Usenet

     This is from the alt.magick group on Usenet. It was posted in the middle of
     the last year.

      Hello,

        Due to an overwhelming email response, I've decided to post my solitary
      G.D. Neophyte (0=0) ritual.  It's still in the experimental stages, so I'd
      appreciate comments.

        A few caveats.  First of all, compared to the 'official' ritual (which
      I included in outline form after my own), it is SHORT.  Much detail has
      been omitted.  This is primarily to aid memorization, but the central
      working or 'purpose' of the ritual can be expanded in many ways (I give 2
      examples).  Because of this flexibility and brevity, it may not stand
      up to 'official' standards -- I probably don't mention enough god-forms,
      stations, or sephiroth (yet) -- but I still think it's a valuable tool.

        In addition, please forgive the somewhat stilted prose in the descrip-
     tions. It was written with the old grade rituals in mind.  Also, some parts
     are completely of my own design (such as the oath and the eucharist at the
     end), but I think they mesh well with the 0=0 'current'.

     ___________________________________________________________________________

      * * * * * * *  THE ENTERER OF THE THRESHOLD  * * * * * * *

     (0)  Precede the ritual with a general purification of the body.

     OPENING:

     (1)  Dim the Temple lights.  Lay out thy circle in a clockwise direction,
          starting in the East.  Set up a veiled Light in the East.

     (2)  Stand in the center of the circle, light thy lamp in the left hand,
          and give the Cry of the Watcher Within:

            "Hekas!  Hekas!  Este Bebeloi!"

     (3)  Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, to banish all
          unwanted energy from the circle.  Precede and follow with the
          Qabalistic Cross.

     (4)  At the center, keep still and listen to the voice of thy Undying
          and Secret Soul.  Say:

            "Let me enter the Path of Darkness and, peradventure, there
             shall I find the Light.  I am the only Being in an Abyss of
             Darkness; from an Abyss of Darkness came I forth ere my
             birth, from the Silence of a Primal Sleep."

     (5)  Purify and consecrate thyself:

          Extend thy arms in the form of a great cross, and say:




                                                                            2394

            "In the name of the Lord of the Universe,"

          Make three small crosses on thy forehead with the LEFT middle finger
          (Stolistes purifies with water), and say:

            "Who works in silence,"

          Make three small crosses on thy forehead with the RIGHT little finger
          (Dadouchos consecrates with fire), and say:

            "And whom naught but silence can express...."

     (6)  The Oath:

          Kneel on both knees.  Raise thy head towards the heavens, and say:

            "I am _______, and I seek the Light."

          Lower thy head to the earth, and say (slowly and methodically):

            "I am _______, and I do this day bind myself to Know, to Dare,
             to Will, and to Keep Silence."

          Raise thy head slightly, halfway between earth and heaven, and say:

            "I am _______, and I am a child of earth and starry heaven."

     INVOCATION:

     (7)  Mystic Circumambulation in the Path of Darkness:

          Rise, approach the North, and face East.  Circumambulate one and a
     half
          cycles with the sun, and pause -- barred in the South.  Take a deep
          breath before continuing, contemplating the uselessness of fear
          uncontrolled, then say upon passing the Hierus in the West:

            "Darkness is thy Name,
             thou Great One of the Paths of Shades."

          Circumambulate one and a quarter cycles with the sun, and pause --
          barred in the North.  Take a deep breath before continuing, con-
     templating
          the need for balance (the Middle Pillar), then say upon passing the
          Hierophant in the East:

            "Light dawning in Darkness is thy Name,
             the Light of a Golden Day!"

          From the East, turn and face the West.

     (8)  Close thine eyes, and hear the Hierophant say, as you step forward    
           four times to the West,

            "I come in the Power of the Light.
             I come in the Light of Wisdom.
             I come in the Mercy of the Light.
             The Light hath Healing in its Wings."




                                                                            2395

     (9)  Turn and face the East.  Open thine eyes and invoke the Lord of the
          Universe as you step four times back towards the East.

            "Holy art Thou, Lord of the Universe!
             Holy art Thou, whom Nature hath not Formed!
             Holy art Thou, the Vast and the Mighty One!
             Lord of the Light and of the Darkness!"

          Simultaneously, make the active invoking pentagram of spirit with thy
          right index finger, and the passive invoking pentagram of spirit with
          thy left index finger.

     (10)  Touch the Light in the East with thy right hand, and say:

             "Inheritor of a Dying World,
              We call thee to the Living Beauty."

           Touch the Light with thy left hand, and say:

             "Wanderer in the Wild Darkness,
                                                   (light the Light)
              We call thee to the Gentle Light."

           Touch the Light with both hands, and say:

             "Long hast thou dwelt in Darkness,
              Quit the Night and seek the Day!"

           Knock with the right foot with each pulse of the Battery, and take
     small steps (9) backwards, extending the Light...

                   KHABS  AM  PEKHT     !
                    KONX  OM  PAX       !
                   LIGHT  IN  EXTENSION !

           Bask in the power and glory of the Light, and imagine the god-form of
           Horus surrounding thee.

     (11)  At this point in the ritual, many things can be done.  Two reflective
           practices, however, are obvious:

           (a)  DIVINATION:  Sit in the center of the circle, face the
                             Light, and perform thy castings.  Begin with
                             the sign of Horus, and end with the sign of
                             Harpocrates.

           (b)  RECITATION OF THE TREE OF LIFE:

                Step forward, starting with the right foot, and trace out
                  the Tree of Life, rising on the upward Lightning Flash.
                  Vibrate each sephiroth-name as it is passed.

                Arriving at Kether in the East, bask in the power and glory
                  of the Light.  Vibrate each Hebrew letter name, starting
                  with Aleph, and meditate on its meaning, position in the
                  Tree, and Tarot image.

                Turn to the West and formulate the Middle Pillar, beginning




                                                                            2396

                  with the sign of Horus and ending with the sign of
                  Harpocrates.

     CLOSING:

     (12)  Mystic Reverse Circumambulation in the Pathway of Light:

           Rise, and approach the East.  Face towards the East and make the 
     signs of Horus and Harpocrates.  Circumambulate with the sun three 
     times (making the above 0=0 signs upon each passage to the East -- 
     three more times).  Stop and turn to the West.

     (13)  Go to the center and face West.  Purify and consecrate thyself:

           Extend thy arms in the form of a great cross, and say:

             "In the name of the Lord of the Universe,"

           Make three small crosses on thy forehead with the LEFT middle finger
           (Stolistes purifies with water), and say:

             "Who works in silence,"

           Make three small crosses on thy forehead with the RIGHT little finger
           (Dadouchos consecrates with fire), and say:

             "And whom naught but silence can express,"

           Extend thy arms once again in the form of a great cross, and say:

             "I declare that the Sun has arisen and the shadows flee away!"

     (14)  Face the East, and take thy eucharist:
           (NOTE:  The following is ancient Egyptian, from the Book of the
                   Dead.  Roughly translates as  "I live in MAAT, I nourish
                   my heart on MAAT")

             Sipping    the  wine, say:   "Onkh-ya, em-maot."
             Eating     the bread, say:    "Som-ya, em-maot."
             Swallowing    both,   say:     "Ab-ya."

     (15)  Contemplate the achievement of the Light:

             "Be my mind open to the Higher.
              Be my heart a centre of the Light.
              Be my body a Temple of the Rosy Cross."

     (16)  Final banishment:  (precede and follow with the Qabalistic Cross).

           Make a rose-cross in the east.  First, make the vertical line, from
           top to bottom, saying:

             "In the name of Yeheshuah the redeemer,"




                                                                            2397


           Make the horizontal line, from left to right, saying:

             "I do now suffer all spirits bound by this ceremony
              to depart in peace unto their places."

           Make the circle, starting at the rightmost point and going clockwise,
           saying:

             "May the blessing of Yeheshuah Yehovashah be with you
              now and forever more, and let there be peace between
              me and you."

     (17)  Stand in the center of the circle, light thy lamp in the left hand,
           and give the Cry of the Watcher Within:

             "Tetelestai!"

     (18)  Douse the unveiled Light.  Take up thy circle in a counter-clockwise
           direction, starting in the East.  Raise the Temple lights.

     The Lady's Prayer

     Our Mother
     Who art here present,
     Honored be thy name.
     Thy time is come
     We shall be One
     On Earth, which is our heaven.
     Give us this day our daily bread
     And love us in our imperfections
     As we forgive those who trespass against us.
     For thine is the spirit of the great
          transformation
     Forever and ever.
     Amen.

                                   The Gaea Thesis

     IN order the understand the nature of the All-Mother, we must first
     understand our own origins.  Each of began our individual life as a single,
     fertilized cell or zygote.  In the processs of its innumerable divisions
     and multiplications, that cell kept dividing up and redistributing the very
     same protoplasm.  That protoplasm which now courses through all of the
     several trillion cells of your adult body is the very same substance which
     once coursed through the bosy of that original zygote.  For when a cell
     reproduces, the mother cell does not remain intact, but actually becomes
     the two new daughter cells.  ANd this is  why, no matter how many times a
     cell fissions in the process of embryological development, all the daughter
     cells collectively continue to compprise but one single organism.
     We may imagine that, should our cells have consciousness akin to our own,
     they may very well fancy themselves to be independent entities living and
     dying in a world that to them would seem to be merely an inanimate environ-
     ment.  But we know them to be in fact minute components of the far vaster
     living beings that we ourselves are.

     Over four billion years ago, life on Earth bega, as do we all, with a
     single living cell containing a replicating molecule of DNA.  From that
     point on that original cell, the first to develop the awesome capacity for
     reproduction, divided and redividied and subdivided its protoplasm into the
     myriads of plants and animals, including ourselvs, which now inhabit this
     third planet from the Sun.

     But no matter how many times a cell fissions in the process of embryolog-
     ical development, all the daughter cells collectively continue to comprise
     but one single organism.  ALl life on Earth comprises the body of single
     vast living being -- Mother Earth Herself.  The Moon is Her radiant heart,
     and in the tides beat the pulse of Her blood.  That protoplasm which
     coursed through the body of that first primeval ancestral cell is the very
     protoplasm which now courses through every cell of every living organism,
     plant or animal,of our planet. And the soul of our planetary biosphere is
     She whom we call Goddess/

             "First life on my sources
             First drifted and swam
             Out of me are the forces
             Which save it or damn
             Out of man and woman
                     and wild-beast and bird
