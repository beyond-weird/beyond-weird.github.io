                Study of the Planetary Hours System
                -----------------------------------
                          by Andrew Kettle.
                                1994

Introduction.    Neo-pagan witchcraft has no central leaders, so
              one of the questions that echos across the valleys
              of the traditions is; "Are there to many cooks spoiling
              the broth?" As most witches are fervent independants, and
              self-assertively so, each will have a differnt approach
              and opinion to such a simple observation.
                 Underneath the whole landscape of debate however, are
              truths and basic historical facts being forgotten or
              distorted? In certain instances it would be deemed
              unavoidable in the present atmosphere of information
              scavenging, where medium communications reveal past lives
              and the knowledge from them to broaden the bookshelves of
              the many esoteric book shops.
                 Be that as it may, studying the large expanse of
              existing wisdom, at times similiar to looking through
              water-glass, will relinquish many difficulties and
              contradictions. To some this would increase the mysticism,
              however when it is a matter of legitimacy where do we
              stand?

Sample Text:
            from "What witches do", Stewart Farrar,1989, Phoenix
                                                       Pub.,Wash. p.174.

        "
         Appendix 3. Planetary Hours.

         These are the traditionally accepted hours for operating spells
         which  have planetary  correspondences. Each  day has  a ruling
         planet; our days of the week in English are mostly named after
         the Teutonic forms of the planet-gods concerned. They are:
         Sunday, the Sun; Monday, the Moon; Tuesday, Mars (Tiw);
         Wednesday, Mercury (Woden); Thursday, Jupiter (Thor); Friday,
         Venus (Freya); Saturday, Saturn. The First hour after sunrise
         is ruled by the day's own planet, after which each hour is
         ruled by one of the other planets in the order Sun, Venus,
         Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so on in rotation.
         Thus Monday's second daylight hour is ruled by Saturn, Tuesda's
         second by the Sun, etc. At sunset a new sequence starts with
         the fifth down the list from the day's planet: thus Monday's
         first hour from sunset is ruled by Venus, etc. The full list  
       is as follows: "

           acticle is not to be taken as a personal attack of the above

            I have used Stewart Farrar's text only as a example of the
           commonly published, and accepted, planetary hour concept.

          10.23pm       Saturn       Rise.           Saturn

Hypothesis: My hypothesis is that the 'Planetary Hours' concept
         is a timetable, based primarily on simplicity, that
         was developed in a age when astronomic technology
         was largely unavailable, so resulting in such a
         system; that in our modern technological society, as
         a result of astronomic calculations being easily
         accessable, that a new system of 'Planetary hours'
         should be constructed upon 'Hours of Right Ascension/
         Planets on the Meridian' where applicable or the highest point
         of ascension, when the planet is not true to the horizon.

Conflict:   As it can be deduced from the above table, certain
         planetary hours occur when the planet in question is not
         within the horizon. For example, the sun's planetary hours of
         3am and 6pm are outside of 'daytime'; Mar's 2am is outside of
         'Marstime'; the moon's 8am is external to 'Moontime'.
            As a principle, I would remark that it would be of
         assistance in rituals that the planet is in appearance and
         that the optimum time would be when the planet is directly
         above, the hour of Right Ascension/ Planet on the Meridan,
         or highest point of path through the hemispheres. If the
         'worshipper' was to have a difficulty with the domineering
         effect of the planet being above them / on top of them, then a
         principle of welcoming the planet at rise and farewelling the
         planet at set are equally as valid.
            Continuing, this would establish only one planetary hour in
         each day, raising the question of practicality, though a rather
3103

         erroneous matter, giving the examples hours of:
                 Mars (9.04am) 9am planetary hour,
                 Sun     (11.49am) 11am planetary hour,
                 Mercury (12.13pm) 12pm planetary hour,
                 Venus (2.26pm) 2pm planetary hour, etc.
            To this end, computer programs and/or annual publications
          would easily create the availablity of the timetable, a future
          project for any publishing house or any number of the pagan/
          witchcraft magazine to have as a regular cloumn, thus giving
          the practitioner the simplicity, not resorting to ill-advised
          system as an alternative.
            However, at this point it should be mentioned that, in
          accordance with general perception, the physical planet
          plays a symbolic role, that the planet is not the vehicle of
          magical properties, but a icon, much as the moon is not Aradia
          in person, but a mirror of her essence.
            Furthermore, it is an accepted belief that the full-moon is
          the time of 'Esbat', though in comparison the remaining
          planets are given an inaccurate timetable; a perplexing
          situation.
            Toward, the modernising approach in witchcraft it should be
          important to establish 'correct' instruction to ritual, upon
          the understanding that it would be a great disservice to
          entertain anything else but actuality; as the turmoil of the
          word 'wicca' has caused in the movement, now accepted by most
          as a redefined word, though all the same established upon
          false impressions, an unfortunate situation historically
          speaking.
            An accurate approach to the craft, that is slowly being
          supported as our cultures' resources and developing knowledge
          widely spreading with discussions and publications, will
          result in a detailed sweep and clean of the old
          misconceptions in the traditions and a polish to reflect the
          light of modern education.

Conclusion: As with the modern approach of Planetary Hours, it should
         be every members directions in tune with open-minded, clear
         thinking not to accept a practice that is incorrect and to
         strive establishing a strengthed tradition on the foundations
         of accurate discovery of the originals of comprehension.
            Such an approach would wash out the '14th century mass
         illiterate' influence that customs have continued. Though
         it must be seen that without this assistance there would
         possible be no present existance of witchcraft, but a
         rectification of this knowledge is by no means an attack.
            Furthermore, it is suggested that a choice should always be
         based on truth and not mislead by mistaken presuption.

"Initiations.
     When witchcraft became an underground organisation, the Craft of
the Wise, it shared a characteristic common to all secret societies.
Admission to it was by initiation.
     Such initiation required the newly admitted member to swear a
solemn oath of loyalty. When witchcraft was punishable by torture and
death, such an oath was a serious metter. Today, when witchcraft has
become like Freemasonry, not a secret society but a society with
secrets, the idea of initiationj still remains.
     Initiations into witch circles nowadays take varying forms, as they
probably always did. However, the old idea that initiation must pass
from the male to the female, and from the female to the male, still
persists. A male with must be initiated by a woman, and a female witch
by a man. This belief may be found in other forms, in traditional
folklore. For instance, the words of healing charms are often required
to be passed on from a man to a woman, or from a woman to a man.
Otherwise, the charm will have no potency.
     There is also an old and deep-seated belief, both in Britian and in
Italy, that witches cannot die until they have passed on thier power to
someone else. This belief in itself shows that witchcraft has been for
centuries an initiatory organisation, in which a tradition was handed on
from one person to another.
     The exception to the rule that a person must be initiated by one of
the opposite sex, occurs in the case of a witch's own children. A mother
may initiate her daughter, or a father his son.
     In general, for their own protection, covens have made a rule that
they will not accept anyone as a member under the age of 21. Witches'
children are presented as babies to the Old Gods, and then not admitted
to coven membership until they have reached their majority.
     This rule became general in the terms of persecution. Secrecy upon
which people's lives depended was too great a burden for children's
shoulders to bear. It is evident, from the stories of witch
persecutions, that witch-hunters realised how witchcraft was handed down
in families. Any blood relative of a convicted witch was suspect.
     The witch-hunting friar, Francesco-Maria Guazzo, in his 'Compendium
Maleficarum' (Milan, 1608, 1626; English translation edited Montague
Summers, London, 1929), tells us that "it is one among many sure and
certain indications against those accused of witchcraft, if one of their
parents were founded guilty of this crime". When the infamous Matthew
Hopkins started his career as Witch-Finder General, the first victim he
seized upon was an old woman whose mother had been hanged as a witch.
     There are a number of fragmentary accounts of old-time witch
initiations, and from these a composite picture can be built up. The
whole-hearted acceptance of the witch religion, and the oath of loyalty,
were the main features. There was also the giving of a new name, or
nick-name, by which the novice was henceforth to be known in the novice
was given a certain amount of instruction, and, if the initiation took
place at a Sabbat, as it often did, they were permitted to join in the
feast and dancing that followed.
     In some cases, in the days of really fierce persecuation, a
candidate was also required to make a formal renunciation of the
official faith of the Christian Church, and to fortify this by some
ritual act, such as trampling on a cross. This was to ensure that the
postulant was no hypocritical spy; because such a one would not dare to
3105


commit an act which he or she would believe to be a mortal sin. Once the
postulant had formally done such an act, they had in the eyes of the
Church damned themselves, and abandoned themselves to hellfire; so it
was a real test of sincerity, and an effective deterrent to those who
wanted to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. Such acts are not,
however, to my knowledge, required of witches today.
     One of the ritual acts recorded as being part of a witch initiation
is that described by Sir George Mackenzie, writing in 1699 about
witchcraft in Scotland, in his book 'Laws and Customs of Scotland"
(Edinburgh, 1699): "The Slemnity confest by our Witches, is the putting
one hand to the crown of the Head, and another to the sole of the Foot,
renouncing thier Baptism in that posture." Joseph Glanvill's book
'Sadducismus Triumphatus' (London, 1726), had a frontispiece of pictures
illustrating various stories of mysterious happenings, and one of these
old woodcuts shows a witch in the act of doing this.
     Her initiation is taking place out of doors, in some lonely spot
between two big trees. With her are three other women, one of whom seems
to be presenting her to the devil, who appears as the conventional
figure of a horned and winged demon. In practice, however, the devil of
the coven was a man dressed in black, who was sometimes called the Man
in Black, for this reason. The "grand array" of the horned mask, etc,
was only assumed upon special occasions.
     A variant of this ritual was for the Man in Black to lay his hand
upon the new witch's head, and bid her to "give over all to him that
was under his hand". This, too, is recorded from Scotland, in 1661.
     Information about the initiation of men into witchcraft is much
less than that referring to women. However, here is an account from
the record of the trial of William Barton at Edinburgh, about 1655,
evidently partly in his words and partly in those of his accusers, which
tells how a young woman witch took a fancy to him, and initiated him:

        One day, says he, going from my own house in Kirkliston, to the
      Queens Ferry, I overtook in Dalmeny Muire, a young Gentlewoman,  
    as to appearance beautiful and comely. I drew near to her, but she
      shunned my company, and when I insisted, she became angry and
      very nyce. Said I, we are both going one way, be pleased to accept
      of a convoy. At last after much entreaty she grew better natured,
      and at length came to that Familiarity, that she suffered me to
      embrace her, and to do that which Christian ears ought not to hear
      of. At this time I parted with her very joyful. The next night,
      she appeared to him in that very same place, and after that which
      should not be named, he became sensible, that it was the devil.
      Here he renounced his baptism, and gave up himself to her service,
      and she called him her beloved and gave him this new name of John
      Baptist, and recieved the Mark.

     The Devil's amke was made much of by professional witch-hunters,
being supposed to be an indelible make given by the devil in person to
each witch, upon his or her initiation. However, it would surely have
been very foolish of the devil to have marked his followers in this way,
and thus indicated a means by which they mightalways be known. From the
confused descriptions given at various times and places, it seems
evident that the witch-hunters knew there was some ceremony of marking,
but did not know what it was.
     In witchcraft ceremonies today, the new initiate is marked with
oil, wine, or some pigment, such as charcoil. However, as Margaret
Murray has pointed out, there is a possibility, judging by the many old
3106

accounts of small red or blue markings being given, the infliction of
which was painful but healed after a while, that this may have been a
tattoo mark. Ritual tattooing is a very old practice; and some relics of
this survive today, in the fact that people have themselves tattooed
with various designs 'for luck'. However, when persecution became very
severe, it would have been unwise to continue this form of marking.
     The most up-to-date instance I have heard, of the marking of new
initiates, is the practice of a certain coven in Britian today, which
uses eyeshadow for this purpose; because it is available in pleasing
colours, is easily washed off, and does no harm to the skin. One wonders
what old-time witches would think of it!

Initiation.

  To become a witch you must have a natural inclination to worship the
Old Gods. It must be a feeling which springs from the heart and carries
you on towards your goal, in exactly the same way it happened to the
first witches thousands of years ago.
  The approach must be in this manner. Any other attitude, such as
vulgar curiosity, a desire for power over others, or the selfish
intention of using magic to gain material ends, will only end in failure
and disillusion.
  The Old Gods are ancient archetypal images of the divine powers behind
all Nature. They are the oldest gods known to man. Pictures of them are
painted all over Europe and show the great influence they had, even at
the Dawn of Time.
  Just because they are so old, is no reason to believe they are in any
way 'out of date'. Our ancesstors were no fools: their way of life and
their culture is gaining more and more respect as the years go by.
Continuous discoveries about their skills and beliefs growing admiration
and amazement.
  Their deities were a Mother Goddess and a Horned God, representing the
twin forces of life: male and female, light and dark, positive and
negative, Sun and Moon, etc. These complimentary aspects in nature are
'fact' and cannot be disputed. And, because the Gods are true
representations of the divine powers behind all manifestation, they have
endured through millennia, and will always endure.
  Unlike many other religions, where contact with divinity is sought
through prayer and meditation, witchcraft teaches development of the
soul through the Eight Paths of the Witches' Wheel. These ways are part
of the Western Mystery Tradition. The West and the East are two very
different places. Eastern religions teach their followers to look
'within' for enlightenment, and although the West uses this method in
meditation, it is only 'one' of the Eight Paths. The Western mind looks
'outward' and seeks spiritual grace by helping others. Thus, the witches
use their powers to help those in sickness or trouble.
  The Awakening can begin as an urge which rises from the depths of the
soul. A state of boredom or despiration, which every human being comes
to at some point of incarnation, can become as a beacon to the spirit.
  It is born to the struggling soul and to the complacent alike. Many
lives may be endured before it is realized that the true self must
take the initiative and begin to fight its own way out of the Cycles of
Incarnation, which, without the control of the Higher Self, may continue
indefinitely. Once the realization is born, and the quest begun, the
soul is on its way from manhood to godhood.
  Regarding the Craft, it is wise to seek initiation from a 'genuine'
coven. This is not as easy as it sounds, as genuine adherents do not
seek converts, and therefore do not advertise for members. they believe
that if a person is sincere and determined enough in their desire to
belong to the Craft, they will, sooner or later, make contact.
  There are, however, various ways of speeding things up a little, such
as contributing to one of the privately printed occult magazines, which
are usually run by people 'in the know'. Or even placing a small advert
in one of these papers. You can also write to the author of a book on
the subject, and send the letter via the publishers. It might then be
forwarded to a coven in your area, although I must add here that even if
3108

this happens, and you are invited to meet someone from a coven, it would
not be indicative of entry.
  There are certain conditions which have to be fulfilled, such as
blending in with the personalities of the members, having read widely on
the subject, a willingness to submit to a waiting period, usually a year
and a day, among others. Yet these conditions are valid ones; you cannot
expect to be accepted quickly, but you will know that the witches you
meet have undergone similar obstacles themselves.
  The ways of the witches are those of caution, especially where
strangers are concerned. After all, who would admit a stranger to their
home without an introduction, let alone to a temple of the Mysteries.
  Care must be taken, too, in finding a coven which is in close
'rapport' with your own life-style, culture and character. But, once
contact is made, there is hope in finding a group where conditions, on
both sides, can be fulfilled.
  Although some covens wear robes, the traditional way of working in the
Circle, is to be sky-clad, or naked. When you are brought into the
Craft, yoou enter as you were born, without clothes or ties of any kind.
The first initiation is virtually an introduction to a new way of life.
You are made a 'Child of the Goddess'; you are shown the tools of the
Craft; told the ways of working magic, and made to swear an oath to keep
the secrets of the Art. This is called the First Degree.
  The Second Degree is the initiation proper. Thsis involves the concept
of symbolic death and symbolic resurrection, when you are re-born with
the new magical personality. A new name (of your own choice) is given to
you which represents the transformation, and by which, henceforth, you
will be known when in the Circle.
  The drama of this mystery play implants its ideas firmly in the
subconscious mind of the adherent, and the mystery, which is enacted
on the material plane, sets the seal on the future.
  It is not to be supposed that by initiation and teaching you will
automatically be 're-born'. A way will be shown, and knowledge
imparted, yet the journey is always 'alone' and the true 'will' tested
to the very brink of breaking point.
  In a sense, when initiation takes place it is very much like daring
Fate to do its worst. One has taken a stand: "I announce to all creation
that I will endure to progress."
  In witchcraft the soul develops a deeper understanding of 'being'.
This entails practice, which is why the Craft has grades of advancement.
The highest grade is the consummation of the mysteries, where ritual
yields to what is termed, 'The Secret of the Silver Wheel'.
  There is also the imparting of certain 'secret' words, which, in
themselves, convey very little, but their secret intention 'is'
important and gently 'nudges' the aspirant onward.

***begins

Altered States of Consciousness (ASCs) are an integral part of ritual.
They can be defined as any mental state recognised by the individual as
different from his or her normal waking consciousness. As such, the act
of separating yourself from the mundane world, having a ritual bath or
shower and preparing the ritual space, is enough to induce some sort of
ASC in most people. Taking on a magical persona involves an ASC, as does
invocation of godhead, dancing or chanting to raise power, meditation,
scrying, and going through a guided visualisation or pathworking.

The use of ASCs in magic and ritual has many benefits. By means of a
guided visualisation or pathworking you can have experiences that would
harm you or be impossible in the mundane world. For example, in a
visualisation relating to fire you can stand in the midst of a roaring
fire or become the flame itself; experiences which might deepen your
understanding of the element fire. Another experience reached through
ASCs is that of the god or goddess being called down upon you, something
that enriches and enlivens your magical life.

Entering an ASC is normally part of the process of stepping onto the
astral plane, reaching the Otherworld, tapping racial memory or the
collective unconscious, contacting inner guides or obtaining information
from your own unconscious. To raise power, many enter an ASC by dancing,
chanting or using breathing techniques. It's then much easier to focus
your concentration, draw on energy, and let it flow through you and into
the object of the spell.

Simple ASCs shouldn't be forgotten. Being able to relax the first time
you cast a circle in front of everyone might help you remember the
words, and will certainly help you focus the power you need. Meditation
is another fundamental skill in magical arts, one that is used at all
stages.

Some ASCs can help you find out more about yourself. By doing so, you
can understand and remove the beliefs and blocks that prevent you from
developing, from using your magical abilities to their full extent.
These blocks are erected as part of the process of growing up. As an
example, if you're told often enough as a child that the fairies that
you see at the bottom of the garden don't exist, eventually you come to
believe it. Understanding and getting rid of this belief twenty years
later so that you can see the fairies again can be a long process, one
which can be speeded up by techniques using certain ASCs.

Like many things, ASCs are tools, often valuable, but also dangerous.
One danger is not coming out properly at the end of a ritual. Being in
an ASC can feel wonderful and it can be tempting to stay there. You see
it happening at some of the New Age workshops, where people get a nice
emotional spaced-out high from a session, and hang on to that feeling as
long as they can - "workshop junkie". The problem is that in an ASC you
do not always have full access to those parts of yourself needed to
perform mundane tasks like driving a car, or doing your job satisfac-
torily. Remaining in an ASC can be quite destructive if you need to
function in the "normal" world.

Occasionally an ASC can trigger what is known as an abreaction in
someone.  Entering the ASC removes the barrier the person has put
between their conscious mind and a traumatic experience they've had. As
a result the person suddenly goes through the experience again, bursting
into tears, yelling with anger, shivering with fear, and so on. This
sort of reaction needs to be dealt with therapeutically; telling the
person to forget it only makes the experience and any problems it has
caused, worse for them. Not only does the person controlling a group ASC
experience need to be able to handle such abreactions, but he or she
also needs to be able, when putting a new group into ASCs, to recognise
individuals with borderline psychoses. The reason is that putting such
people into an ASC, especially trance states, can push them over into a
full-blown psychosis. For example, putting an epileptic into trance can
trigger epileptic seizures.

Control is an important aspect of ASCs. In a ritual, at least one person
should remain in control, able to take over and bring the group out if
anything goes wrong. That person makes sure that no-one is taken over by
an entity which remains after the circle, and that no inappropriate
suggestions are made. (In ASCs, especially trance states, you are much
more suggestible, and might inadvertently pick up someone else's comment
as a suggestion - after all, this is the principle upon which TV
advertising is based.) They also make sure that everyone comes out and
grounds properly at the end of the ritual.

Another area where control is important is where an ASC is entered from
another ASC. Pathworking, visualisation and scrying is often more
intense, more meaningful, if done in circle. This is because when you
start to do the pathworking or whatever from a mild ASC instead of your
own normal waking state, you tend to go further or deeper, and thus gain
more from the exercise.  However, using drugs to enter an ASC before
performing ritual is a completely different matter. Drugs leave you with
no control over the first ASC you enter, so the outcome of entering a
second one can be quite different from what you expected. The harder the
drug, the bigger the problem is likely to be. A drug might, on a rare
occasion, have a place in ritual, but only when the effect of the drug
on the person taking it is known, there is a very good reason for its
use, and someone else is available to deal with any problems that might
arise.  Drugs also sap the magical will and discipline by preventing you
from learning how to achieve the results you desire by yourself, and
encouraging you to be lazy. In the end your ritual work suffers.

ASCs are a fundamental part of magical ritual. The basic arts -
meditation, concentration and visualisation - all involve ASCs in some
form. It is easy to get caught up with the glamour of something
different, something that feels good, that is outside our normal
experience and upbringing, and forget that, like most things, there is
a negative side to ASCs. They are a tool; useful once you master them,
but dangerous if misused. For many, ASCs have become the basis of their
path to spiritual development.

                        The Betty Crocker Cult 
For the edification and entertainment of all, I am letting you all see
one of the rarest pieces of modern ritual literature today. it is
copyrighted 1993, M. Perrin, Jersey City, NJ.


                What Do Betty Crocker Cultists Believe?

        For all intents and purposes, Betty crocker Cultists believe
whatever I, the Grand High Ladle, tell them to believe. The B.C.C. is a
cult in the truest sense of the word, with one infallible leader, me.
For indeed it was I, Badger Girl, who received the word of Betty, when
I least expected it, right in the middle of an episode of the French
Chef.

        Thrust as I was, right in the middle of pagan controversies of
all stripes, it was clear to me that there was something missing in our
community as a whole. That thing was the Kitchen. Not just food, you
see, but the Kitchen, with all of its wondrous utensils, appliances and
storage capacities.  I knew this to be the answer to many of today's
modern pagan problems. Betty told me so. "Go forth to the stove" said
Betty, and go forth I did, taking most of the women (henceforth to be
known as "Ladies") of Green Man Grove with me, as I hate to eat alone.

        And lo! Many splendid things did befall us as we cavorted amidst
the Tupperware. Betty spoke to me as we did, and she sai, "Now you're
cookin', kid!", and of course, She was right. Soon we all tired and
Betty took advantage of the situation (as is Her way) to tell us of her
many colleagues in the world of the "Other Kitchen." She spoke of Oscar
Meyer, patron of fathers in the Kitchen, also She spoke of Lttle Debbie,
Goddess of cellophane wrapped snack foods. the tale of the Pillsbury
Doughboy (Poppin' Fresh, to the initiated), the God of phallic foods
that go "Fuff" was revealed to us, as well as the story of Mrs. Paul,
Queen of the Frozen Seas. Betty then bespoke of the twin deities of the
most sacred barbecue flame, Lee & Perrin, and also of Aunt Jemima,
keeper of the Holy Syrup (and it was good!). Finally Betty told us of
that most well preserved of holy mean, Earl Tupper and we were silently
awed by the miracle of the Burp Seal.

        Surely did Betty talk a blue streak that fateful day! Then Betty
told me that She had chosen me to be Her Grand High Ladle on this
earthly plane, and to gather around me all the minions I couls strongarm
into the Cult. "You and your initiated minions shall be know to the
world as "The Dash Board"!" said Betty. Betty then explained the
hierarchy to be adhered to within the Cult. The lowest initiates being
the "Cups" and all higher initiates gradually getting smaller and
smaller until acheiving "pinchdom" if not actual "dashery." And so,
I said unto Betty, "Sounds good to me!" and she seemed well pleased.

        This is how I became the Grand High Ladle. I am chosen by Betty
to lead you to the Kitchen and getyou all cookin'. If you choose to
follow, it will be by my say so and the approval of the Dash Board. The
initiation will be grueling and with any luck, really intimidating. You
seeker, may have finally come to the right place, then again, maybe not,
only i can be the judge ofthat.

                             The Berserkir 
This letter appeared in Web of Wyrd number 7:

With reference to the ongoing discussion of the berserkir or "bear
shirts" Viking warrior clan. P G Foote and D M Wilson state in their
book, "The Viking Achievement" (Sidgwick & Jackson UK 1970) that the
berserkers worked themselves up into a frenzy which gave them super-
normal strength and made them indifferent to blows. It was generally
believed that they had magical powers, although they were regarded as
inferior to the great heroes of the Viking sagas. The berserkir howled
savagely as they went into battle, and Foote and Wilson speculate that
these battle frenzies were the result of excessive alcoholic intake.
According to Icelandic Law (Christian version) anyone who fell into a
berserk frenzy was considered highly dangerous and could be classed as
an outlaw from society. The following verse from the epic poem "Atlamal"
circa 11th century CE is believed to contain a reference to the
berserkir and their method of fighting, as well as to another warrior
clan who wore wolf skins, and may be connected with lycanthropy!

               Full they were of fighters
               and flashing bucklers,
               western war lances
               and wound-blades Frankish;
               cried then the bear-pelted,
               carnage they had thoughts of,
               wailed then the wolf-coated
               and weapons brandished.

It would seem the berserkir wore tunics of bearskin because the animal
was their totem and they believed they could magically attain its
strength. Their unorthodox fighting methods - akin to the "battle spasm"
of Celtic warriors possessed by the god/desses of war - and the modern
meaning of the term "to go berserk" suggest they were less than
self-controlled but in fact fought, quite literally, like men possessed.

MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

The equations of Schrodinger and Dirac, well known in quantum
physics, describe the laws of the conservation of probability for
fluxes of matter at the level of elementary particles of the
microworld. By means of certain mathematical transformations I
(Dr. Iskakov) obtained equivalent equations of a much broader
applicability. They describe the laws of the conservation of
probability for fluxes of matter, energy, and information. The
equations have a deep philasophical meaning, which extends far
beyond the interpretation of the Schrodinger and Dirac equations. An
appropriate name for them is, in my view, suggested by a doctrine
of Oriental philosophy--karma. In a narrow sense, it claims that
every deed or thought, good or bad, receives due reward or
retribution. In a broader sense, it denotes the principle of unity,
integrity, and inter-conditionality and causality in the Universe.
That is how I construe the term "equations of karma", which
describe any cause-and-effect relationship.

WHAT IS THE "EQUATION OF KARMA"?

The study of psychic phenomena dictated the need to define the
concept of the information-energy field. Its material medium,
according to contemporary notions, may be a global lepton gas,
consisting of extremely light particles, microleptons, with a mass
of 10^-40 - 10^-30 g. Microleptons are much lighter than electrons
and are capable af freely penetrating any body in the Universe. The
gaps between atomic nuclei are for them just as spacious as are the
holes in a fishing net for molecules of air.

3114

The idea of a microlepton gas appears to echo the 19th-century
notion of the universal ether, but is scientifically much more
complex and profound. What we are talking about in this case is no
longer an ideal space-pervading fluid, but a quantum-granular
structure of the space-time continuum, filled with whirling streams
of polarized microleptons (including some virtually vacuum-born).

Such an approach enables us to use the mathematical apparatus of
quantum mechanics to describe the information-energy field.
Moreover, relationships of a higher level of generalization are
derived than the classical equations of Schrodinger. The new
equations describe not only the movements of matter, but also the
development of the totality of interconnections, signals, events,
and processes. The special term introduced for such relationships
is "equations of karma". As for karma, it is understood to mean a
broad philosophical category of universal inter-conditionality,
causality, and dependence in combination with the principle of the
unity and integrity of the Universe. There are two equations of
karma--the direct and the complex-conjugated:

GS> (NOTE:  I have substituted regular letters for the Dr.'s
GS> symbols)

       AY=0; A'Y'=0;

      where the operators have the form

       A=2h^2V + i2h o/o t-9;
       A'=2h^2V - i2h o/o t-9.

Here Y denotes the probability density wave (the wave function);
V, the Laplace operator; 9, the potential energy density, and h,
Planck's constant.

These equations may be solved in the form of karma waves and
anti-waves with quantization of probability waves. Connected with
them are perturbations of the information-energy field, i.e., wave
signals. In principle, such signals may propagate faster than light.

The equations of karma make it possible to draw certain
philosophical conclusions of fundamental significance. It follows
from them that diffraction takes place not only in space but also in
time. Any event is, so to speak, split in space-time. The
propagation of a solitary signal is preceded by a series of pre-
signals and followed by post-signals, both fading with distance.
Perceptive analysts are able to use the first intimations of
pre-signals to give a precise picture of a coming event. This is
called scientific foresight. But there is also intuitive prevision.
Centuries ago clairvoyants described events that are happening in
our time.

Pre-signals provide an explanation of relative proscopy--when a
sensitive person learns about an event before others do. Such a
person detects faint pre-signals that most people do not perceive.

For instance, an explosion on the Sun may produce solar prominences
extending for millions of kilometers. Two or three days later the
"solar wind" reaches the Earth, causing powerful geomagnetic
3115

storms that affect everything living. During such periods, disease
and mortality rates increase in all countries.

This dependence of everything living upon solar catastrophes was
proved several decades ago by Alexander Chizhevsky. Can we learn of
the approaching "solar winds" in advance? It appears that we can.
The solar wind has presignals: swift streams of solar photons an
neutrinos, which reach the Earth in eight minutes. By detecting them
it is possible to warn the medical services of all countries of an
imminent geomagnetic storm two or three days in advance, ample
time to take the necessary measures.

From the theoretical standpoint the works of the eminent Russian
researcher Anatoly Okhatrin are of definite interest. They confirm
the idea of an ether or universal lepton gas, which contains full
information about the material world. Clusters of the lightest par-
ticles--microleptons--carry people's thoughts and feelings; these
microleptons are capable of travelling in space and time at
tremendous speeds.

The speed of light is a limiting factor only for a continuous stream
of speeds, the so-called continuum. However, greater speed levels,
in excess of the speed of light, are possible for extremely weak
signals.

Okhatrin's experiments and calculations show that people's thoughts
are carried by the lightest microleptons. And the equations of karma
prove that they can travel much faster than light. This justifies
the conclusion that humanity's potential in getting to understarnd
the Universe is practically boundless.

Up to now it was considered that our potential in the conquest of
outer space is limited by what is known as the pessimistic radius
of Poincare-Einstein. If we multiply the speed of light by the
human life span, we arrive at the limit that even the most sophis-
ticated spaceships cannot surpass. No generation of spacemen can
explore the Universe beyond that radius [it says].

But from the equations of karma it follows that at the level of
extremely weak signals we can reach out far beyond the Poincare-
Einstein sphere. Material thought can travel to distant regions of
the Universe at a speed greater than that of light. Man can obtain
information about what is happening at any distance from him. This
is a fundamental philosophical conclusion that allows humanity to
look to the future with optimism.

I arrived at this conclusion by considering the equations of karma.
But then, many scientists before me have reflected on the
synthesis of science and religion, among them the founders of
quantum physics. What are termed the conjugated equations of
Schrodinger and Dirac point to the possibility of the existence of
anti-particles. Similarly, the conjugated equation of karma suggests
that there can be anti-signals as well as anti-particles. More-
over, this equation makes it possible to describe the spectrum of
properties that these anti-signals possess. While ordinary signals
travel along the river of time from the past via the present into
the future, anti-signals travel in the opposite direction. They
originate in the future and pass through the present into the past.
3116

This property of anti-signals stuns our imagination: certain
particularly sensitive people and instruments can, it turns out,
receive signals from the future.

Previsions, predictions, and prophesies come under the scientific
heading of absolute proscopy, which implies the acquisition of
information about events that have not yet taken place. They have
yet to occur, but sensitives already know about them.

The problem is merely one of the threshold of sensitivity and the
balance of signals and noise. Anti-signals come from the future at
a faint and very faint level. Very few people can detect them.

There is no violation here of the principle of causality. Rather,
its interpretation becomes more sophisticated and more refined
dialectically. According to the equations of karma, time in the
microworld can reverse its direction, turning, as it were, into
"anti time". From a single point it is possible to see both the past
and the future of microparticles at the same time.

We can receive information about the future only at the
probability level. Only the strategic parameters of a human fate are
pre-determined. But freedom of choice too is preserved: a person is
free to take any decisions and bears full responsibility for them.
A person shapes his or her destiny and pays for the consequences of
those decisions. Thus, there is a predetermined part of the future,
which a person cannot change, and there is a probable or variable
part, for which he is responsible.

Solving stationary equations can yield curious results. Waves
emitted and absorbed by hundreds of biologically active points are
superimposed on one another and form a series of standing waves,
which surround the human body. The body turns out to be nothing more
than a dense nucleus shrouded on all sides by a number of
energy-information holograms. The shape of the first hologram
follows that of the human body, but is enlarged and rounded,
remotely resembling a spacesuit. Actually, this hologram contains
all the information about the body and is carried by microleptons
orbiting along the quantum shell, the boundary of the first
hologram. The second hologram and its shell are larger and carry
weakened information, which is more difficult to decipher. The
same may be said of the third and subsequent shells. The more remote
shells are more rounded in shape, changing from a spacesuit to an
egg and then to a sphere. Our atomic-molecular body is "clad" in
microlepton holograms, each of which carries complete but weakened
information about the person, including his or her innermost
thoughts and feelings, his or her mind and conscience. It may be
said that the sum-total of these holograms is nothing short of a
person's lepton soul.

Ordinarily, people do not see the energy-information shells that
surround them. But in certain conditions it is possible to make the
first hologram glow, especially the part of it surrounding a
person's head. The fact is that upper chakras, the most
power-intensive, operate at the highest frequencies. Some people
have a first quantum shell that can become visible.

Estimates show that the energy of the first shell amounts to
3117

fractions of an electron-volt. This is quite enough for a faint glow
in the optical range of the spectrum. But for the glow to become a
reality a great deal of energy has to be pumped into the upper
chakras. This means a person has to adopt a definite mode of life:
overcome base passions, and make his or her thoughts, feelings,
and deeds pure, lofty and inspired. It is in that case that the
energy of the upper chakras causes the excitation of the first shell
by fractions of an electron-volt, and a halo visible to other people
appears around the head of such a person (for example, a saint).

In Christian art, only part of the hologram around the head is
usually portrayed as glowing. But in Buddhist temples, there are
pictures showing the whole spacesuit-shaped hologram aglow.

The most ancient Buddhist manuscripts speak of a person's seven
bodies: one dense and six subtle. The first hologram is called the
ethereal body; the second, the astral body; the third, the mental
body, and so forth. The lepton hypothesis allows a larger number of
holograms.

Judging from the equations of karma, we humans are infinitely
"larger" and our lives are infinitely longer than we are accustomed
to think. This means that each person is a factor of Cosmic
significance.

Moreover, analysis reveals that inanimate objects as well as Homo
Sapiens and other living beings have holograms of this kind.

Consider the implications of this. If each body is present, at the
information level, throughout the Cosmos, then in every small region
of space-time there must be, if only super-weak, information about
the entire Universe.

Gautama Buddha's famous dictum states "everything is in
everything" and, hence, "everything is in the small." In an expanded
form this may be taken to mean that every point of space-time
"knows" everything about all the other points.

But if every zone of space "knows" everything, it is a most
complete encyclopaedia, in infinite storage of knowledge about the
Universe . All that is needed is to learn how to plug into this
source of information, which can tell a person about anything and
everything in the world.

It follows from the lepton hypothesis that the soul is real and
material. A human being, in the customary sense of the term, is
nothing but a dense nucleus around which streams of leptons
circulate. The totality of lepton shells is a cold bioplasma,
which contains complete information about the nucleus. Thus, it
can be termed a person's lepton soul. This notion has a quite
precise materialistic content.

According to the lepton concept, thoughts and feelings are material.
They are carried by superweak pulses of electromagnetic and
microlepton fields. Visual, audible, and other images, and all
thoughts and feelings, exist in the form of clusters of superlight
elementary particles. This brings to mind Plato's inspired guess
that all eidoses, i.e., ideas or thoughts, exist autonomously,
3118

"float in the air" and recognize no boundaries.

Plato intuitively arrived at that conclusion over two thousand years
ago. Today we can put this into the language of mathematical
formulae. We can measure the mass of a single human thought. Its
weight varies from 10^-30 to 10^-40 g. To be sure, the opinion of
sensitives and Okhatrin's experiments cannot serve as proof. Similar
investigations have to be carried out at other laboratories. This
will furnish the statistical data for reliable conclusions. If they
confirm Okhatrin's findings, he will become the author of the
greatest discovery of the latter half of the 20th century.

Thoughts and feelings generated by human beings begin their
independent existence in space and time. Both theory and experi-
ments show that these eidoses are capable of exchanging information.
What is most important of all is that one person's thoughts can
occur to other people. Eidoses are like small living beings, but at
the lepton level of matter. Thoughts and feelings are our offspring,
who communicate with one another and with us in a language of
super-weak signals.

Estimates show that during a lifetime a person generates millions
and even billions of eidoses. This makes it clear that we bear an
enormous responsibility before the whole of humankind and before
ourselves for what our offspring, i.e., our thoughts and feelings,
will be like.

When our offspring are noble eidoses of kindness, love, mercy,
mutual assistance, truth, beauty, and harmony, we contribute to the
health of humanity's leptonosphere. But when we beget malformed
eidoses, i.e., evil, envious, cowardly, vain, and arrogant thoughts
and feelings, we thereby pollute the leptonosphere we inhabit.
Should the negative eidoses exceed a certain critical mass,
humankind will be doomed. At present our survival depends to a great
extent on the ecology of the spirit.

Here we also come up against a legal problem. Mere criminal intent
is not yet a crime at the atomic-molecular level, but when a person
conceives, say, a murder, he or she spawns criminal eidoses, which
contaminate humankind's leptonosphere.

That is why when someone steers a nation or country onto a road
leading to disaster, that person commits the gravest offence above
all against the whole of humanity. Although economic and
political catastrophe is still many years off, it has already
taken place at the lepton level, in the public mind. The collapse of
a vast State can contaminate humanity's leptonosphere to such a
degree that humanity's very existence becomes threatened. And no
clan, no state, nor coalition that conceived such a crime against
other nations can survive.

The lepton hypothesis can provide a scientific explanation of the
essence of God. When congregations gather in their temples, they
create eidoses of prayer, which assemble into a collective
egregor-eidos of a deity. When millions of people worship it, the
material deity eidos acquires tremendous energy at the lepton level
of matter. There arises feedback: a believer not only supplies the
deity with energy, but receives genuine assistance from it upon
3119

supplication. There exist eidoses of Christ, Buddha, and Allah, and
they actually interact with their Worshippers when the latter tune
into the proper frequencies. This is something like a deposit in a
savings bank--it helps the client at at a time of need. The
microlepton "savings bank" is not responsible for other banks'
clients: there is no resonance correspondence between them. Alien
gods hold no power over a flock--only their own God has such powers.

Gods, thus, actually exist at the lepton level of matter. In fact,
the world religions describe different aspects of one and the same
Supreme Rational Being. All the people of the Earth worship a single
God, but in His multiple manifestations.

After the death of a person's atomic-molecular nucleus, his or her
lepton holograms may take different courses. Some of them may
likewise disintegrate. But this happens only to the holograms that
are made up of the heavier microleptons. Estimates show that the
relatively heavy holograms have a natural half-life of seven to nine
days; their ninety-nine percent decay takes about forty days.

Thus, the meaning of the funeral repast on the 9th and the 40th day
(in accordarnce with the Orthodox faith) is that the living emit
eidoses that recharge the dead person's soul with energy and
information to help it undergo the necessary changes in the lepton
world. Thanks to these rites, relatively heavy lepton holograms can
survive much longer. A reliable supply of living people's thoughts
and feelings can extend the life span of the heavy fractions of a
dead person's soul from forty days to several millennia. As long as
a person is remembered and his or her days of birth and death are
observed, that person's soul is preserved almost intact, just as it
was when the person was alive. One can communicate with it by means
of special techniques known to mystics.

The soul also has medium and light fractions. We cannot yet
verify this experimentally, but there is reason to think that
their half-lives and total decay periods are much longer than those
of the heavy fractions. It is even quite possible that the lightest
fractions live eternally--the soul is immortal according to all the
world religions. So far science cannot confirm or deny this in
strict terms. This problem remains unsolved and requires an
experimental solution.

[END OF QUOTING]


(Hatonn's comments)

The next most logical question might well be , "Isn't there any way
to measure this lepton energy or aura?" Yes indeed and again the
only ALLOWED presentation comes silently from Russia. There are two
scientists--the engineer and inventor Uri Kravchenko and the
physician Nikolai Kalashchenko--who have developed an original
instrument: the phase aurometer. This is a highly sensitive instru-
ment for the remote measurement of the electromagnetic radiation
of any object, biological included. The instrument and the method
are protected by a Certificate of Authorship issued in 1990. This
is an easy-to-prove concept and because of this implication I will
not introduce much about it other than generalities about which
3120

much has been shared. This is something which Dr. Young has already
devised though he doesn't recognize it as this and I would think
would remind our own "tinkerers" that this is nothing more than a
measuring device or a production device for electro-magnetic
fields MEASURED IN HERTZ.

The particular phase aurometer in point is only for measurement or
recordimhg a "patient's" own radiation by a contact-free method and
has no impact whatever on the environment. BUT, LISTEN UP: THE
APPLICATIONS OF THE PHASE AUROMETER CAN BE CONSIDERABLY EXPANDED
FURTHER INTO, FOR EXAMPLE, DOWSING, TESTING FOLK HEALERS AND
SENSITIVES AND SUCH SEEMINGLY DISTANT FIELDS AS AGRICULTURAL
SELECTION OR CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE SUPERVISION.

I am not going to publish this information in general format as
above. However, I do ask that several of the attached "tinkerers" be
supplied with the documentation. We need to introduce frequency
upgrading into seed for crops, etc. This is easily done but someone
has to do it and I cannot spend time educating those at random
distance. So, please make sure that Dr. Young, Dr. Hoffman, Dr.
James and Dr. Trelle are made privy to the document in point. Thank
you. It will seem quite primitive to you ones--but sometimes
simplicity is where we must RE-begin in order to conceptually change
directions. I salute you for your patience.

 THE KNOTS OF DEATH
 by Alby Stone


A number of Viking monuments feature a curious design known as the
valknut, the "knot of the slain" or, more loosely, "the knot of death".
On an 8th century CE picture stone from Hammers in Larbro, Gotland, it
consists of three interlocking triangles. This stone, now in Stockholm's
National Historical Museum, is divided into several panels; one of the
central panels, in which the valknut occurs, depicts several motifs that
suggest some sort of connection with the cult of Odin - an eagle, a
flying figure - possibly a valkyrie - holding a ring, a man being hanged
from a tree and a group of three warriors - with shields and upraised
swords - led by a fourth man who seems to be holding a large bird of
some kind. The valknut is adjacent to the eagle and below it are two
men, one with a spear, who appear to be engaged in placing a corpse
inside what looks like a burial mound. Between them and the hanged man
is what appears to be another, smaller, valknut of the same design. This
type can also be seen on a rather splendid golden ring discovered near
Peterborough, Cambs, and currently on display at the British Museum in
a cabinet labelled as containing Anglo-Saxon "secular" metalwork.
Another picture stone from Gotland (Tangelgarda also in Larbro) has a
panel showing a rider being welcomed by a woman holding a drinking horn
with four men who are holding rings. The woman may be a valkyrie, a
"chooser of the slain", one of whose functions was to serve ale to the
Warriors in Valhalla, another pointer to the cult of Odin. The rider has
a valknut behind his head and there are two more among his horse's legs.
On this stone, which can also be seen at the Swedish Museum, the valknut
is made up of a single line, interlaced to make three triangles.

Similar to the Tangelgarda design, but slightly more rounded, is that
carved onto one of several "hogback" monuments at Brompton, Yorkshire,
and probably dating from the 10th century CE. The end-beasts of this
particular hogback - these monuments are based on Viking Age houses
(although to this eye they have more than a passing resemblance to long
barrows) and the end-beasts are situated at what would be the gable ends
- are easily identifiable as bears, again suggesting the cult of Odin,
who was patron of the Warriors known as berserkr or "bear-shirts". The
purpose of the hogbacks is uncertain; no graves have been found with
them so they were certainly not tombstones. Hogbacks with undecorated
ends at Lythe in Yorkshire exactly match the shafts of crosses found at
the same site, indicating that the hogback formed a composite monument
with a cross at each end. In this case the hogback is certainly a
religious monument and it seems fair to suppose that the Brompton
hogback and its fellows, and similarly ended hogbacks elsewhere, are
also religious structures, albeit of a different faith.

The Brompton hogback has five valknuts in a row. The Brompton style
valknut also occurs on each of the four arms of the Gosworth Cross
(Cumbria), on both faces. The shaft of the cross strangely enough has
scenes from heathen myth, and the only remotely Christian looking scene,
which has been rather desperately identified as the Crucifixion, seems
to owe more to the rune-winning ordeal of Odin described in the heathen
poem "Havamal" than it does to the New Testament. The same type of
valknut appears on the shafts of crosses at Sockburn (Co Durham),
Lastingham, Hawsker and Brompton (all North Yorks). On the last, three
3122

of these valknuts are arranged in a triangular pattern.

A fourth type of valknut, rather different from those described so far,
occurs on a stone cross from Andreas on the Isle of Man and is now in
the Manx Museum, Douglas. This version is basically a simple knot "tied"
in such a way as to retain the basic tripartite structure of the
versions mentioned above. Unlike the others it is not a closed structure
but its identity as a valknut, while mildly contentious, is not really
in doubt. The scene in which it appears shows a man, evidently Odin,
holding a spear pointing downward as he is devoured by a great wolf. An
eagle perches on the man's shoulder and the valknut is at his side. The
same design appears elsewhere, on a stone discovered in 1822 at Gosforth
and now incorporated into the structure of the local church. It is
between the back legs of a horse. On a picture stone from Alskog, in
Gotland, it occurs twice among the eight legs of Odin's horse, Sleipnir.
Despite this seeming wealth of examples and the diversity of styles the
valknut itself has remained enigmatic. It seems to be associated with
horses, particularly with the steed of Odin, and the cult of Odin in
general. Motifs associated with the symbol include the hanged man,
valkyries, bears, and the scene from Ragnarok on the Manx Cross, all
indicating some connection with Odin. According to HR Ellis Davidson,
the valknut also appears on the funeral ship excavated at Oseberg,
Norway in 1904, and on the tapestry found in that vessel, indicating
some sort of funerary association.

The origin and meaning of the symbol are extremely difficult to discern,
as is its association with Odin. Obviously it has a decorative value as
distinct from its symbolic meaning. The valknut has been used as a motif
by Scandinavian weavers since the Viking Age. Indeed, it is recognised
as a traditional design in that part of the world quite apart from its
alleged occurrence on the Oseberg tapestry. Davidson opines that it is
related to the Celtic triskele, the three-legged symbol most familiar as
the emblem of the Isle of Man and linked with the Irish God of the sea,
Manannan. The triskele is essentially a variety of the swastika, a
common enough cosmological symbol, but neither can be said to possess
the characteristic interweaving of the valknut. While it may be unwise
to dismiss a possible relationship between triskele and valknut, it
must be said that any resemblance is purely superficial, lying solely in
their tripartite structures. Structurally the valknut has more in common
with the Celtic triple spiral motif which is also found on Old English
and Pictish artifacts and much older objects. Unfortunately there is a
dearth of hard evidence for the mythological or religious significance
of the triple spiral, which tends to occur within wholly abstract or
symbolic designs, but it occurs within funerary contexts and has been
linked with the female principle by various scholars. The various types
of valknut, their contexts aside, share two important characteristics:
they are tripartite and they are constructed by
interweaving or interlinking.

Davidson also postulates a link with the bindings that occur in Norse
tradition. The best known examples of this are probably the binding of
Loki following his betrayal of Baldr; the binding of Baldr himself, a
theme that found itself into Scandinavian and Old English interpre-
tations of the Crucifixion; the binding of the wolf Fenrir; the ritual
binding of sacrificial victims, as partly confirmed by the discovery of
bound corpses in the peat bogs of northern Europe; and the Herjoturr or
"war fetter", a kind of paralysis that Odin and the valkyries were said
to be able to inflict upon unfavoured warriors in the heat of battle. To
3123

these we might add the hangman's noose characteristic of the double
sacrifice - simultaneous hanging and stabbing - known to have been used
in the cult of Odin and a method of ritual killing that accords with
the condition of a number of bog corpses. One bog discovery, the severed
head of a man discovered at Osterby in Denmark, is very interesting; the
hair on the right side of the head is gathered into an elaborate knot
that looks very much like a valknut.

Tacitus, writing at about the time the Osterby man is believed to have
met his end, about the 1st century CE, tells us that the warriors of the
Suebi (a generic name for the Germanic tribes inhabiting the region now
occupied roughly by north western Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands)
tied their hair in such a knot, and a number of Roman monuments depict
Germanic warriors with the same hairstyle. It would be reasonable to
suppose that this hair-knot marked a warrior as a follower of an early
form of Odin in his role of war god. (See the author's article on
"Heretical Hairdos" in Talking Stick magazine Spring 1992 for a further
discussion of pagan hairstyles and the symbolic significance.)

The noose found around the neck of the Lindow Man unearthed from a peat
bog in Cheshire a few years ago consists of a sliding knot in a cord
knotted at each end, making a triple knot. A similar noose was found on
a body in a peat bog at Borremose, Denmark but the noose found on
another Danish corpse, from Tollund, is much simpler. Dr Anne Ross and
Dr Don Robins, along with the Danish archaeologist Professor P V Glob,
believe that these nooses are related to the Celtic torc, and note that
a number of torcs seem to be designed to look like garrottes. They
suggest that the corpses from Tollund and Borremose were sacrifices to
Nerthus, a goddess mentioned by Tacitus, and that the torc was an
attribute of that goddess. Tacitus also tells us that certain warriors
of the Chatti wore iron collars that would not be removed until they had
killed their first enemy, although many chose to wear them until they
died. In their case the collar probably indicated they were dedicated to
a god of war as opposed to a goddess of peace and plenty like Nerthus.
It would be rash to state unequivocally that the collar and torc
represent stylised versions of the noose or garrotte - but it is an
attractive proposition. However, torcs and collars are not valknuts, and
only the nooses found on Lindow Man and his Danish counterpart can
possibly be construed as being such.

It seems fairly certain that the valknut has a cultic or religious
significance and a particular association with death, as it name alone
indicates. The Andreas Cross shows the death of Odin, himself the Lord
of the Dead Warriors of Valhalla, and on the Alskog stone the valknut
appears by the feet of Sleipnir, the steed on which Odin, and also
Heimdall, rode to the land of Hel. It is seen by the hanged man and in
the funerary scene on the stone from Hammars and on the Tangalgarda
stone the rider seems to be receiving a welcome to the realm of
the dead. The scenes often include female figures who appear to be
valkyries or maybe even the death goddess Hel herself. The presence of
the valknut on Viking Age crosses in England and on the Brompton hogback
hints at a retention of this element of heathen iconography among the
adherents of the new cult.

The valknut is certainly part of the iconography associated with Odin
but that fact alone brings us no nearer to its meaning. Representations
of Odin and scenes from myths pertaining to him are common enough and
their components are usually readily identifiable. If the valknut does
3124

stem from the cult or mythology of Odin, then it must represent
something that cannot be given a pictorial rendering, either because of
a taboo or simply because it just cannot be pictured in anything but an
abstract form.

The form is tripartite and interwoven; the context is mortuary, Odinic
and Otherworldly and it has both equine and feminine associations. This
set of conditions is peculiar to the mythology of the World Tree and can
be related to certain beings associated with it. The World Tree is
Yggdrasill or "The Steed of the Fearful One", which makes it a doublet
of Sleipnir. It has three roots which link the worlds together.
According to Snorri Sturlson, each root leads to a well or spring;
Hvergemir in Niflheim; Mimisbrunnr "in the direction of the frost
ogres", and Urdabrunnr "in the sky", the Well at which the three
Nornir gather to decide the fates of humans and gods alike.

Now it is clear from a number of references that these three wells are
in fact only one under three different names. A consideration of their
locations clinches the argument. Hvergelmir is the primordial well,
situated in the north, according to Snorri's account of the creation of
the cosmos. The nature of the "frost ogres" means that they can also be
located in the cold north, and the central point of the revolving sky is
also in the north, at the Pole Star.  The Nornir derive their collective
name from an archaic word meaning "north" which also denotes "that which
is below" (compare English nether, be-neath).  The name of the goddess
Nerthus (a goddess of the earth) reported by Tacitus may also be so
derived.

While the Nornir each have individual names in England, they go by the
name allocated to the eldest in Norse Tradition. The elder of the three
is called Urdr by the Norse, which is cognate with the Old English
"wyrd", hence the three "weird sisters" of Shakespeare. Thus they are a
three-in-one being in the same way as the Irish war goddesses known as
the Morrigna. Like the other, inevitably triadic, Indo European fates,
the Nornir spin and weave destinies.  One of them is also named as a
valkyrie.

This brings us back to Odin, himself a shaper of destinies. In the
"Gylfaginnning" section of Snorri's "Edda" he appears in a triadic guise
and is credited with having taken a drink from the well at the centre of
the world, one source of his wisdom. Odin acquired the wisdom of the
runes while hanging on the World Tree and could obtain information from
the dead. The latter - apart from those worthy fighters chosen to
carouse in Valhalla until Ragnarok (the Twilight of the Gods) and those
who ended up in the paradisal Odainsakr, or abode of the righteous dead,
the hall Gimle - resided with the dread goddess Hel in the underground
realm variously known as Niflhel, Niflheim or simply as Hel located in
the far north. This goddess of the dead was said to be Loki's offspring,
conceived and born while he was in the form of a mare following a
dangerously mischievous escapade.

Actually she can be traced back to proto-Indo-European times and her
original name has been reconstructed as Kolyo, "the coverer". As Bruce
Lincoln puts it in his book, "Death, War and Sacrifice" (1991), "Her
domain is underground and she physically conveys her victims thence by 
fixing a snare or noose on their bodies and dragging them down. Her
bonds regularly fall upon the foot or neck of the victim, the same
places where domestic animals are fettered. The deceased are thus led
3125

away like animals by Death, in whose bonds they may struggle, but which
they cannot escape, caught in her snares and dragged under."

Lincoln presents an impressive body of evidence to support this summary,
from Ancient Greece, Rome, Scandinavia, India and Iran. The theme has
altered from place to place and from one age to another but the essence
has remained. He also notes that the Middle High German term for a noose
was "helsing", which he translates as "Hel's Sling". He argues that
German sacrifice by hanging, generally related to Odin or Woden, was
actually a ritual enactment of the seizing of the victim by the goddess
of death. Given the mutual concerns of Odin, Hel and the Nornir, it
seems to make little difference either way.

In Old English texts the term "wyrd" is, despite its other connotations,
frequently used to denote death rather than a structured and unfolding
future that is suggested by the functions of the Nornir and their Greek
and Roman counterparts. There is of course an intimate relationship
between the two concepts and death is after all the fate of every being.
Scandinavian myth makes it clear that there are only two things which
the gods cannot avert; fate and death. In Norse myth the name of the
senior Norn is Urdr, a word in Old Icelandic that can also denote a
burial mound or cairn. "Beowulf" and other texts characterise wyrd as a
weaving of webs but the word usually means nothing less than the moment
of death, or at least the events leading up to death. 

The "Beowulf" motif is revealing, however; it has already been noted
that the fates tend to be spinners or weavers and in this instance there
is also the idea of a snare, which can refer back to the Indo-European
goddess of death as described by Lincoln. Like Hel, the Nornir reside in
the far north, at or near the celestial axis and like her they reside
"below ground", where the World Tree has its roots. The Nornir determine
life, span and the time of death, while Hel takes the dead to her cold
bosom. All these characteristics are shared to some extent with Odin, as
is their femininity, apparently adopted by Odin in order to engage in
seidr - the natural magic of womankind.

At the very least, Hel and the Nornir are closely related, perhaps even
deriving from the same proto Indo-European goddess, and Odin has
acquired some of their characteristics by virtue of his association with
the cosmic centre, the structure of which reflects their own nature. If
the valknut symbolises anything then, it is probably either wyrd, death,
or perhaps even the Nornir themselves, who are more or less the same as
wyrd anyway. Exactly when the valknut would have come to represent these
is difficult to estimate. Certainly the examples here all date from the
Viking Age and appear to range in time from about the 7th to the 10th
centuries CE. I am not aware of any valknuts of a significantly earlier
date. It is interesting that in England the use of the valknut seems to
have died out with the establishment of Christianity and the consequent
decline of heathenism. The Nornir are not represented pictorially
anywhere in the Germanic world, which is rather surprising. A panel of
the Franks Casket shows three hooded figures who might be intended as a
likeness of that fateful trinity, but it is by no means certain. Until
any conclusive artifacts come to light the truth of the matter must
remain as uncertain as the workings of the Fates themselves.

                          Memorial Day Ritual 

This is a copy of the script written for a Memorial Day and
Warrior's Honor Ceremony performed at the Heartland Pagan
Festival in 1992.  It was written during the festival by She-Wolf
and Gary Stanfield, and is the latest of a few editions.

This ceremony was intended for participation by any persons who
can accept the Wiccan ceremonial format and who have been
or are likely to become touched deeply by war. Realistic acceptance,
loving reconciliation, and emotional catharsis are the major themes.
Fears, regrets, sympathies, feelings of caring, and grievings are dealt
with intensely.  Adventure, patriotism, the joy of battle, etc.
are ignored.

The setting is outdoors in mid-morning light in a clearing among trees.
There is a fire in the center of the temple space and an altar at
the northernmost point of the circle.

                    MARTIAL HONOR CEREMONY

1.  Defining of the Temple Space and Time.
All participants form into a circle as a drum beats slowly and
steadily (about one beat per second).  When the time comes to
start, the HPS breaks from the circle and begins to define its
outer limits with a sword.  After she has just begun, the priest
raises an old, rust-marked sword into the air -- this cues the first
speakers.  Alternating male and female voices call out (one from
each quarter as the HPS passes):

"Thermopylae!"

"Gettysburg!"

"Desert Storm!"

"Uncounted thousands of battles!  Uncounted thousands of wars!
Over uncounted  thousands of years!"

Then the HP puts down his sword as the HPS rejoins the circle.

2.  Calling of the Quarters.
The priestess, taking one step forward from
her position next to the altar says:

"Guardians of the East, Spirits of Air
Breath of life, lost to those who have died
attend our rite and protect this circle."

"Guardians of the South, spirits of fire
Heat of battle, warmth of living flesh
attend out rite and protect our circle."

"Guardians of the West, spirits of water
Sweat of our bodies, blood that was spilled
Attend our rite and protect our circle."


3127

"Guardians of the North, spirits of Earth
Symbolized by salt, once the soldier's pay
Earth to which we all return
Attend our rite and protect our circle."

HPS then asks attendees to sign themselves, sealing their auras.
[This can be done with a pentagram, hammer sign, or other sigil].  She
returns to her place by the altar.

3.  Interdenominational Invocation of a War Deity.
HP takes one step forward from his position next to the altar and says:

"As we must accept the parts of our psyches associated with our
pasts in war, we must honor deities of war in our pantheons.
We honor you -- Athena, Indra, Woden, Mars, Morrigu, and
many others.  Please come to us now."

Someone costumed and equipped to portray a war deity emerges
from the circle to near the center of the temple space and says:

"Now also honor those humans who were honorably involved in warfare:

     Those who were your enemies and those who were your friends;

     Those who volunteered and those who were pushed by circumstances;

     Those who were heroes and those who were just in it;

     Those who fought and those who only stood ready;

     Those who survived war and those who did not;

     Those uncounted millions of your times and of times past --

     They have no need to be ashamed."

"Do not admire mindless rape, plunder, nor terrorizing.  Do not admire
raids upon the defenseless -- although in war some predation is
necessary."

"And since there is no shame in being a victim of a mighty tide,
you shall extend compassion to refugees and other civilian and
military victims."

"Raise your right fists into the air to salute honorable warriors
and to civilian heroes and heroines."  (War deity raises his/her
right fist as this order is given.  After the deity drops the salute,
the others drop it also).

"Give the salute of embrace to signify compassion for refugees and other
victims."  (War deity crosses his/her arms over his/her chest to signal
the start of the salute of embrace and everyone else does as the war
deity does.  The war deity signals the end of the salute by dropping
it).

War deity returns to circle.


3128

5. Closing.

HP:  "We thank the war deities for their attendance."

HPS:  "Let us be mindful that sometimes the warrior is the victim also."

"Spirits of air, we thank you for your attendance.  Receive in peace
the spirits of those who were raised on funeral platforms.  We bid
you hail and farewell."

"Spirits of fire, we thank you for your attendance.  Receive in
peace those whose funeral pyres burned brightly.  We bid you hail
and farewell."

"Spirits of water, we thank you for your attendance,  Receive in
peace those lost or buried at sea.  We bid you hail and farewell."

"Spirits of Earth, we thank you for your attendance.  Receive in peace
those buried in the earth.  Mother earth, return to us again in new
forms, if it be their will, the spirits of those who have fallen."

"For those who have fallen!"  (She pours wine on the fire in the
center of the temple space).

"And the bread of compassion for the victims of war."  (She
crumbles bread and drops it onto the ground).

HP:  "By this ceremony may each of us be strengthened --
deity, spirit, and living human alike."

"Nor this circle is open, but not broken."

"Please ground, and you may hug."

                       CELTIC WORKSHOP (Internet)
This is an Upload of the first Celtic Workshop on Druids, Oghams and 
Divination. Each student was supposed to have already downloaded the
Library 16 files Oghamd.txt (A table of Ogham correspondences),
Fionnw.GIF ( A symbollic representation of Oghams in Circles.) and
Ogham.GIF (A picture showing exactly how each tree Ogham symbol looked.)
In additional to these files, messages were posted in the Section 15
message board for Ogham correspondence tables by Nigel Pennick, D.J.
Conway, John Matthews, Murray Hope, Douglas Monroe and Edric Thorsson.
A lot of information is contained in these files and messages and
is essential for fully understanding the workshop and discussion. I 
recommend reading "The Celts" by Nora Chadwick for historical background
on the Celts as a people. I recommend John Matthews book "Celtic
Shamanism" and also Nigel Pennick's book "Magical Alphabets". More
complete discussions of many of these topics are found in those works.

Due to time constraints, All the prepared material did not get
presented during the Workshop. I have included it here in it's entireity
at the request of the participants and in the interest of completeness.

Before starting the Workshop, we engaged in informal conversation  with
the first topic being the book "Life of a Druid Prince". Jehana asked 
if I had read this book.

<Start of Workshop>

O'Dubh  : Never read the book
Jehana  : It's basically an archeological/anthropological study of...
          one of those sacrificed humans they pulled out of a peat bog.
SUZAN   : hello Jehana!
Jehana  : with some interesting speculations as well.
          Hello suzan.
          Hail!
O'Dubh  : I saw an article on it with pictures in Scientific American I 
          think.
          Merry Meet Again Maiden!
Jehana  : yes, i think they covered it there, too.
O'Dubh  : looks like UFOs are the talk of the town tonight.
Jehana  : And The Crone greets the Maiden!
SUZAN   : there was a great TLC special on an archeological find like

         we'll cover.
Susan W.: great
O'Dubh  : Dia dhuit, a Kheltoi is ni Kheltoi!
          (Hello to all Celts and Non-Celts!)
          We are going to be having on-going Work Shops regarding Celtic 
         Topics of Interest here in the NewAge Forum. I hope to draw
               you Celts and NonCelts alike out of the Groves and into the
               CO's!<G> Time to share some of that Knowledge we've been
               hiding! 
          I plan to touch on the following topics of interest:

                  CLASS #1
                  Druids, Oghams, Divinations
                  CLASS #2 
                  Deities, Shamanism, Magick
                  CLASS #3 
                  History, Warriors, Geneologies (maybe your family         name!)
                  CLASS #4 
                  Languages (Gaeilge, Gaelic, Welsh, Manx,Breton), 
                  Poetry, Prose

          I will basically upload files to the library, prior to the 
          class, to provide a focal point for the discussions and a 
          framework for building a Celtic Book of Shadows. We will 
          flesh these frameworks out through discussions online. I, 
          by no means, have all the answers on matters Celtic. 
          But I truly believe that ALL of us, working together, can 
          approach advance our knowledge and rediscover the True Celtic
               Way.

          Druids are especially welcome to attend so that our Celtic 
          Knowledge may be "Illuminated"!<G> 
          I also hope that The Welsh Bards will grace us with the Songs 
          of Taliesin. 
          
          Other topics will be included based upon the desires and 
          direction of the students and other participants.

          I see the way that the workshops will be conducted as:

O'Dubh  : OK That was the announcement and sorry if it was wrapping on 
          your screens!<G>
Jehana  : sorry, i do have to go; i will put this workshop on 
          next monday's calendar.
O'Dubh  : I'll continue with the presentation
          Ce'ad Mi'le Failte!  (100,000 Welcomes)
          Welcome to the Celtic Workshop!
          We will be investigating  and sharing our knowledge
          of matters Celtic here. 
          It is my hope that the researches and references 
          I have will add to or compliment your own. 
          I am, by no means, the final authority on 
          these matters. 
          Discussion and interaction, coupled with a
          shamanistic journey or two should fill in
          the gaps and illuminate us all.
          all
Dean    : hello
O'Dubh  : Tonight I hope to lay down a firm framework
          for our knowledge of Druids through a
          discussion of their Magickal writing,
          called Ogham, after Ogma - Sun Face,
          and through a discussion of their divination
          techniques.
          It is commonly thought that the Druids left
          no written records of their work.
          I disagree.
          Many references exist that contain the
          poems of Druids, stories about their Magicks,
          tales of their strategies, their secret lore,
          their Oghams, their invocations, their victories
          and their defeats.
          The major problems with using this information
          is that it is the product of a long
          (tho reliable) oral tradition that was finally
          written down by their antecedents the Culdean
          Monks of the Celtic Church.
          (Probably Druids in hiding).
          Some of the Irish manuscripts 
          used as references on Druids are:
          The Book of Armaugh
          The Book of Ballymote
              (A primary source for Oghams)
          The Tain Bo Cuailgne
3132

          The Book of the Dun Cow
          The Book of Invasions
          The Book of Leinster
          Many references to what Druids did
          are contained within the above books.
          Much of what Celts wrote was symbollic
          of deeper meanings.  Each work can
          be interpreted on many levels.
          In modern times, Druidry is being studied
          by several major groups, ADF and OBVD to
          name just two.
          If we have any Druids present tonight,
          Please come forth and identify yourselves now.
          (well, since only us chickens are here!<g>)
Susan W.: .
O'Dubh  : I'll identify myself as a student of Wicca, Druids and Celts
          Susan W>Whatis your interest or area?
Susan W.: I have no knowledge in this area . .
          I have been told a little bit by a friend.
          The extent  . . .
          is that I understand this Wicca, Druid beliefs,
          are very old and are based on the powers of the earth?
          ga
O'Dubh  : yes the knowledge of Druids/Wiccans is based upon the Earth
and 
          it's power.
          The knowledge of the Oghams is tree knowledge applied as
symbols
          in the use of Magick and Divination.
          I'll upload some info on each symbol
          or group of 5 symbols and show what their
          meanings are.
          The Druids were the shamans of the Celtic
          Clans. They carried the history, the culture 
          and the geneologies of the Clan in their memories.
          To aid in remembering this information,
          Oghams were used, each Ogham being
          associated by its beginning sounds
          with the item to be remembered. This
          is similar to alliteration in today's
          writings.This led to an entire series of
          different types of Oghams.
          Tonight we will discuss tree oghams and Fionn's Wheel.
          Ogham BTW is pronounced "O Wam".
          It's one of those strange Gaelic things!<G>
          I have listed the Oghams for
          those of you that haven't 
          downloaded the Ogham GIF's
          or the Ogham Divination files
          in Library 16 yet.
          Each Ogham is listed by its
          ancient Gaelic name, then its
          modern Irish name and then its
          Welsh counterpart.
          The first group of 5 is from the
          North on Fionn's Wheel.
          (it is from the Book of Ballymote)
          7th century Irish manuscript.

Susan W.: How would you use this information, for example . . .
          the Native Americans use prayers for certain rituals, such as 
          blessing your surroundings.
          How would you use that infor.?
          Ga
O'Dubh  : The information would be used 
          in divinations and in casting spells.
          It would also be used to mark pathways for Spiritual journeys
          into the Celtic Otherworld.
          The first use of Oghams was on Birch, for instance,
          and it was interpreted by the Irish God Lugh to mean
          that a Magickal attack was going to be made
          upon his wife.
Freepowder: hi all
O'Dubh  : He took precautions.
          Hi Freepowder !! we are underway with our workshop.
Freepowder: I didn;t miss it?
O'Dubh  : I'm just telling Susan how Ogham information was used.
          It's happening right now.
          Anything missed will be in the library.
Freepowder: out standing, but I can't stay long<sigh>
O'Dubh  : Susan>Does that answer your question?
Freepowder: GA
Susan W.: So, he called upon the spirit of the Birch tree to protect 
          him???
O'Dubh  : He used the Magick of the Birch symbol to protect him and
          his wife. Birch was used to surround them and protect them
          from Magickal attack. Lugh's wife was in danger of being
          spirited away to the Underworld.
Freepowder: (sorry) who are we talking about?
Susan W.: Gottcha. :) Difference in interpretation. GA
O'Dubh  : The Celts were also shamanistic just like the Native Americans
          Ok
Susan W.: ?
O'Dubh  : FP>We are talking about the use and meaning of Oghams and 
          symbols of Magick.
          FP>GA
Freepowder: in general?
O'Dubh  : Well I'm presenting the meaning for each Ogham as based upon 
          the information handed down by the Irish Druidic Bards.
Misty   : Can you tell us a little about the shamanistic part of the 
          Celts?
Freepowder: ah!
O'Dubh  : Misty>I will cover that more fully next week but....
          the Celts lived close to nature as did most peoples
O'Dubh  : in the past. They observed that they had to interact with
          it on a more personal basis than we do today.
          I am introducing symbols and diagrams to be
O'Dubh  : used in Magickal journeying.
Misty   : Ok, sounds good!!
Freepowder: O'd> the Celts focused mainly on Trees & shrubs, while the 
          NAIndians,
Freepowder: focused more on animals , right?
O'Dubh  : FP>The Celts tied Oghams to everything...
          Birds, animals, shields, flowers you name it!<G>
Freepowder: !
O'Dubh  : They even had a secret Hand Language<G>!
          GA
3136

Misty   : I've heard of that...how was that used?
Freepowder: <aside> sounds like modern gang!>...
          Ogham was used like runes or tarot?
          ga
O'Dubh  : FP>one of the messages I posted has a direct correllation for
          Oghams and TArot!
Susan W.: ?
Freepowder: I missed it, been a heavy wkend<abashed> GA
O'Dubh  : It's in Section 15.
          Susan >GA
Susan W.: I had someone give me a shamanistic (N.Amer.) style
          drumming experience. ..
          in which I saw the trunk of a very large tree . .
          with a section that you could walk into  . . .
          like the old forest located S. of Yosemite . . . what are
those 
          called again. ?  Anyway GA
          Any meaning to that vision? O'D?
          Sequoia . that's it.
          O'D> GA
SUZAN   : O'D is having some trouble with his connection.......
          he will be right back.....
Susan W.: ok
          I'm probably gonna split in a few . . . been on almost 2hrs.
SUZAN   : thanks for being patient
Susan W.: What are your interests again Suzan?
SUZAN   : i am an astrologer
Freepowder: Suzan> by the look of it we have just got started w/ this, 
          right?
Susan W.: Hi O'D
Freepowder: welcome back O'D
O'Dubh  : Sorry about the line going down!<G>
          Thanks guys!
Freepowder: Mercury is retarded<G>
O'Dubh  : So where were we?
Freepowder: Sequoyah in vision
Susan W.: Did you get I saw trees in a vision?
O'Dubh  : FP!>LOL probably what the prob is!<G>
Freepowder: GA<G>
O'Dubh  : Susan>Yes
Susan W.: Any importance?
O'Dubh  : I was telling how Celts/Druids
          saw all of life interconnected like the Oak limbs
          I believe your vision is telling you 
          to look within yourself to see how
          you connect to the life around you
          perhaps you should go on a shamanistic journey.
Freepowder: ?
O'Dubh  : Discover your inner truths.
          FP> ga
Freepowder: Shamanistic Journey?...
          you mean like a vision quest?
Misty   : Did we lose him again?
O'Dubh  : Yes FP but along definate paths
Susan W.: O'D> celtic style?
O'Dubh  : let me continue and I'll show you the map.
Freepowder: GA
O'Dubh  : Susan>Definately Celtic style if that is what you feel closest
3137

          to.
Susan W.: Actually more N.Amer. style :)
O'Dubh  : Native American style is nice but I am a Celt.
Susan W.: Tell me your way.
O'Dubh  : Watch and see !!
          they (the ways) may be closer than you know!:)
Freepowder: <watching><G>
O'Dubh  : Ok I'm going to skip the Ogham meanings and go straight to the

          Wheel of the journeys.
          This is Fionn's wheel and is a GIF in Lib 16.
          <now uploading path names>
          Fionn's Wheel is a diagram found in the Book of Ballymote. 
          It shows all 25 Oghams arranged around a series of concentric
          circles (in library 16 as fionnw.gif). This diagram can be 
          used to divine paths necessary for "Pathworking", a very 
          powerful shamanistic technique. I have identified the meanings
               of each Ogham on the paths (using the correspondences from
               Nigel Pennick mostly). Each Ogham's meaning can require at
               least a workshop of it's own to fully cover. I offer these here to show what can be done with Oghams:
          
          An Roth de an Bealach
          (The Wheel of the Ways)
          ___________________________________
          Each path will be identified with it's Gaeilge/English name 
          and the elements along the Ways.
          
          The Northern Path is first.
          (from outside to inside)

          This is the first path on Fionn's wheel
0jim     : hellod
O'Dubh  : It contains the first 5 Oghams B L F S N
jim     : hello
O'Dubh  : This path is first because it teaches the new
          student how to protect him/herself from Magickal harm.
          HELLO jIM
          Please standby
jim     : ok
O'Dubh  : this is a formal Workshop
          But join in !!! 
          Any way, the first step was Purification,
          followed by gaining an ally in "the Red MAn",
          a being kind of like Coyote in Native American workings.
          The tree of life is there as well
          (this could be what Susan saw in her dream)
          The Moon represents the protection of the Goddess
          When the inner level is reached
          the student gains the keys of knowledge

          but not the wisdom to use them.
          Another journey must be made.
          That is the next path.

Scott   : uh oh.
O'Dubh  : JiM>We are Druids, Pagans, Witches and stuff like that.
jim     : !
O'Dubh  : You are well to listen in to the workshop.
          Jim>standby just a second.
          FP has a question
          FP>ga
Freepowder: I thought Samhain was the beginning of the Celtic year?
          ga
O'Dubh  : FP>It's the begining of the Celtic year but not necessarily
          the begining of the study of Celtic religions.
          ga
Freepowder: ?
O'Dubh  : FP>ga
Freepowder: Imbolc...
          is the start of this path of wisdom?...
          or study on fionn wheel, right?
O'Dubh  : FP>The study of all the major festivals is the second path
          The symbol is actually the Grove.
          The most powerful Magick in the Druid rites
Freepowder: ah!
3139

O'Dubh  : was The victory of life over death,
          the renewal of the wheel of the year,
          the marriage of the Crone to the Oak King or Cernnunos.
          That would not be an appropriate start point for begining
          the study of Druidic Magicks. (Before a student can begin
          Magickal work, the ability to shield and protect oneself
          must first be developed. This is why the first way studied is 
          the way of protection. The next step to performing or learning

          occult wisdom would be in a protected environment, such as rituals or Circles. What better ritual for a fresh start than
               Imbolc which is symbollic of New Beginings and the Quickening
               of Life?  Samhain is actually the end point of the year and
               represents the  culmination of the Druidic Mysteries.

          Jim>I believe you had a question?ga
jim     : not really
O'Dubh  : ok
jim     : just watching and laughing
O'Dubh  : any other questions?
Scott   : ?
Misty   : So are you saying that Winter Solstice is the beginning of 
          the wheel?
O'Dubh  : Jim>I suggest that you watch your behavior
          since the forum has some strict rules about 
jim     : ?
O'Dubh  : putting down what others believe.
          Jim>ga
jim     : i'm not putting you down, just enjoying the show
O'Dubh  : Jim>Are you done?
          or do you have a question?
jim     : 1!
          ?
O'Dubh  : Jim>ga
jim     : soo sorry if i offended anyone, didn'y mean to
          got to go
O'Dubh  : Goodbye jim
          now to continue
Freepowder: Slan leat J
Scott   : ?
O'Dubh  : the next path to aid us in becomming more enlightened is the 
          Eastern path on the wheel.
Misty   : What about my question?  Or did someone beat me to it?
         ********  Answer inserted by O'Dubh  ****************
         (I completely missed Missy's question in all the confusion.   
        The answer to Missy's question is that Samhain is the begining 
          and the ending of the Celtic year. It is the time when the God 
         of the Underworld marries the Crone aspect of the Goddess. The 
         new God or the Sun is not yet reborn until the Winter          Solstice.  The Celts began their days at sundown. It is not surprising that they began their new year with the end of the last harvest.  The period between Samhain and Imbolc is the dark part of the year and is therefore like the night before the day. During this period preparations were made for the onset
of winter and the coming spring planting.)

What follows is the rest of My presentation concerning divination:

O"Dubh  : Western (read Druidic) meditation was usually done 
        for divination and foretelling the future. 
        This was called by the names: Tenm Laida, Dichetal
        Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.

        Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state 
        usually achieved by chanting or singing of a repetitive 
        pattern. This can also include drumming and dancing. 
        These activities synchronize the body and mind to
        an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains 
        of normal existence.

        This allows one to float at peace within the song 
        (dance, beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic 
        or Shamanistic practice even though it may look like TM.

        Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) 
        is a state achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind 
        in a Ritual environment. It usually involved using some 
        Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword or a staff 
        to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or involved 
        the handling an item so that the diviner could discover 
        what secret knowledge was contained within it. 
        This information could be events from a person's past life, 
        a detailed history of who and what had happened to an object 
        or how and why the subject was being hexed or spelled. 
        I know this sounds like ESP but it was enhanced through 
        Ritual and relaxation techniques. I believe that Dichetal
        Do Chennaib is the proper state for performing Ogham
        divinations as well. More on this later.

        Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state 
        used by seers and bards to create or see visions. 
        The Druid would be totally isolated from all sensory inputs, 
        sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually a very
        dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt 
        to float and relax. When in the proper state he/she would 
        signal for the hides to be removed or he/she would open 
        the door out of the Darkness. The sudden, instantaneous 
        transition from Darkness to Light would cause him/her to see 
        visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or to 
        achieve a total Awareness of the secret Knowledge of 
        their Surroundings. This sensory deprivation forced oneness upon

        them and caused them to become centered and to float. It was 
        their Ultimate Meditation technique.

        The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter
        their consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean   
        Mysteries and may have actually been the source of them!<G>

        Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but
               I don't have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.


3144

O'Dubh  : To perform an Ogham divination , one must be clear about the
        purpose or object of the divination before begining. Focus this 
        purpose in your mind before starting meditation and/or Circle
        casting. I find that working within a Magickal Circle tends to
        prevent outside psychic influences but don't believe it's 
        absolutely necessary to use a Circle. The form of divination
        is Dichetal Do Chennaib. 
        
        What we will be doing is casting sticks or "fews" upon a casting
        cloth. The sticks are about finger length and size and carved
        with Oghams for each of the 25 symbols. (I prefer to work with
        woods that are the actual symbols used for each Ogham where    
        possible.
        Obviously, some "Crane Bag" symbols are not trees and will have
        to be carved on some neutral wood or other substance, shells or
        rocks for instance. I use Ash or Oak for any substitutions.)
        The casting cloth is a representation of Fionn's Wheel and can
        be multicolored (as in the GIF), plain (Black and White) or just
        drawn on the floor or ground. I like to make the largest Circle
        about my height (in my case 6'2" but use what is suited to you).
        I orient the Wheel with the "B" Ogham to the North. I stand on
        the South side of the Wheel facing North about 3 feet back from
        the "M" Ogham. Place the Oghams in a bag and then randomly     
        select 7 of them. Close your eyes, spin around three times while
        blanking your mind from everything but your purpose. At the end
        of the third spin toss the 7 "fews" into the air about 3 feet
        above your head and towards the center of the Wheel. Once they
        have settled out immediately read the arrangement of the sticks
        as a general impression only. Write this down. Also record the
        relative orientations and postions of the "fews" upon the Wheel.
        Pick up the cast sticks and return them to the bag. Repeat this
        process twice more so that a total of three readings is        
        available.

O'Dubh  :You should now have three Wheel/Ogham Divination charts that 
        have the relative positions of 21 Oghams on them. Interpret the
        Oghams based upon the correspondences I referenced previously.
        (This came from Nigel Pennick's Book "Magical Alphabets" with
        the actual meanings for the Oghams being from the Bardic/Druidic
        traditions as passed dowm by the Clan Bards of the O'Flahertys).
        I use the correspondences that "feel" right to me. You should
        do the same. No one set of correspondences is the absolutely
        right one to use. The above correspondences just hang together
        better in my own mind. The basic technique to reading the tale
        of the sticks is to read then deosil (clockwise) and from the
        outside to the inside. The "fews" towards the center represent 
        the future and those towards the outside the past. Any sticks
        not on the Wheel are ignored. Crossed sticks conflict. Parallel
        sticks compliment or enhance. Sticks laying on Oghams of the
        Wheel have combined effects. The interpretation is not hard and
        fast. I read the symbols as a "story" that is dynamic. I take
        all three divinations together. If they have no correllation at
        all, I ignore the results and try again. Sometimes A divination
        is not possible. I'll try at least three times to get results.
        The relative agreement of each of the Three Wheel/Ogham charts 
        determines the degree of confidence one can have in the
readings, from utter certainty to total confusion! (reminds me of Sex
for some reason but that's another story!<G> I guess the point is that
3145

such Powers and their use are not instantaneous or easy to realize
at times. Sometimes its easy and other times impossible no matter 
how much you try!<G>) This entire process of interpretation is very
similar to: Palmistry, Tarot, Astrology or Runes. They are all basically
taking seemingly random or (at least) uniquely individualized instances
from a person's life and attempting to give meaning to such events based
upon how they relate to Magickal symbols and patterns. What is actually
occurring is that the left brain is gathering facts from the cast
patterns that configure the mind and Spirit to allow the right brain to
make the "Salmon leap" to intuitive insight or Illumination. This is 
Dichetal Do Chennaib or "cracking open the nuts of Wisdom" at its
finest.

        After the divination is finished, dismiss your Circle and fold
or erase your casting Wheel or cloth. Store them separately and away
from normal life until they are to be used again. I recommend a wooden
or cedar chest. Use whatever represents peace, quiet and solitude for
you.

O'Dubh  : So what have we found from this discussion of Druids, Oghams
and divination? We found that Information exists concerning Druid Oghams
in the ancient 7th and 8th century writings of Irish monks-Druids. We
disovered that Fionn's Wheel can be used as a divination casting cloth
and as a "map" for "Pathworking". We suggested that the Ogham correspon-
dences can identify unique ways to Magickal knowledge and insight.  Most
of this information came from oral Druid histories that were finally
written down in the first millenia by the Druid remnant or Culdean
Monks. I admit that some of my presentation has been colored by my
interests in other forms of MAgick that have more readily available
information, such as Runes, Tarot and Astrology. I have also made every
effort to go to an ancient textural source or, at the very least, to a
modern writer basing their work upon ancient verified Druidic works. In
our future investigations into Druidic practices and Magick, I hope to 
continue using the same techniques to discover or rediscover the
Mysteries of the inner Druidic Knowledge.

       Freepowder           | I'll be good, O'd, promise
       O'Dubhain            | A Workshop is another word for a CO But
since its a WOrkshop it's supposed to be hardere!<G>
       Eric                 | and maismic??
       O'Dubhain            | ANYway
       Falcon               | *maismic*
       O'Dubhain            | The way this works to date is I talk about 
some subjects and we discuss them
                                  | then we maybe come up with some new ideas
       Sue Thornburg        | Sounds terrific. :)
       O'Dubhain            | It runs like a formal CO to begin Just put
in a ? or a !
       Fred McCandless      | so toss out an idea
       O'Dubhain            | If you have a comment or a question
                                  | OK
                                  | First last week
                                  | We talked about Druids Oghams and Divination.
       Fred McCandless      | ?
       O'Dubhain            | I placed a bunch of  files in the library
16 to be used in the workshop.  ok Fred>GA
       Fred McCandless      | si
       O'Dubhain            | Fred> Got a question?
       Wren                 | He's gone, O'd
       O'Dubhain            | anyway the way it works is just like 
3147

that!<G> ok The files give you background on what we discuss.  So the
first question I would ask is....
       Jehana Silverwing    | hi odubh.
                                  | ust 
       O'Dubhain            | Why are we studying these subjects?
                                  | Hi Jehana!
                                  | I mean what are we going to get out of this 
                                  | study?
       Nan                  | cause we like to waste $$ on CI$? <GGG>
       O'Dubhain            | ANyone want to volunteer an opinion?
       Falcon               | !
       O'Dubhain            | Falcon>ga
       Falcon               | I study things because they are there and
I feel I should learn as much as I can
       Nan                  | !
       O'Dubhain            | Me too Falcon!<G>
                                  | Nan>ga
       Nan                  | on a more serious note....I'm interested
in learning about them because they are part of my heritage and the
heritage of those around me
       O'Dubhain            | That's a reason I study them too Nan. When
I asked myself these questions I came up with some answers.  Why study
Oghams?  The answer was because the Druids used them in Magick.
       David Pfeiffer       | To add more to that Nan, being new here,
I'd like to learn more about the history of the natural beliefs because
they may be the only saving grace of this planet.
       O'Dubhain            | They are symbols of Magick.  David> That's
a good one too.
       David Pfeiffer       | Sorry to interrupt. <g>
       O'Dubhain            | The reason I study Magick is just that
that's ok I study Magick of the Earth and of people and of the SPirit to
find the keys to who I am How we relate to each other and to the Planet
       Jehana               | i agree with david.
       O'Dubhain            | This is a time that we are all coming
together to save ourselves and our Planet The ancient Wisdom shows us a
Way to do this Jehana
       O'Dubhain            | We must look within for the Power of
self-awareness For growth and harmony.  The Oghams are the roadsigns on
the Ways to this Wisdom
       David Pfeiffer       | But the whole idea is not for ourselves. 
We are just as important as individuals as a leaf is to a tree.  One
leaf only holds so the tree may live.
       O'Dubhain            | One map of this inner journey is Fionn's
Wheel.  Right again David.  But we must start with ourselves.  To have
a tree one must have leaves. and branches and a trunk and roots as well
as Life.  It's all got to work together.  The purpose of this workshop
tonight is to  determine the way that Fionn's Wheel shows us how to
"Pathwork" to knowledge of ourselves.
       Nan                  | ?
       O'Dubhain            | To show how Druids did this Yes Nan
       Nan                  | i think i know what you mean by "pathwork"
but could you please give a brief definition so that i know we're
thinking the same
       O'Dubhain            | OK. Pathworking is basically an inner
journey to discover Truths within ourselves
       Falcon               | ?
       Nan                  | thanks
       O'Dubhain            | It allows us to tap a "Higher" wisdom To
3148

know our totems and our Spirit guides. Yes Falcon ga.
       Falcon               | What is Finion's Wheel?
       O'Dubhain            | Fionn's Wheel is a representation of the
Oghams laid out in Circles around a center.  Like a Native American
Medicine Wheel.  It is pretty much the same thing for shamanistic
purposes I uploaded a GIF of it into Lib 16 as FIONNW.GIF
       Falcon               | thanks
       O'Dubhain            | On it are the Ogham symbols for our
journey.
       Wren                 | ?
       O'Dubhain            | Each symbol represents an ability or a
knowledge to be gained or understood, Wren ga
       Wren                 | Is there a book with the diagram?  I can't
see GIF's
       O'Dubhain            | It's in the following books: "The Book of
Ogham" by Edred Thorsson, "The Celtic Shaman" by John Matthews
       Jehana               | will capture the gif.
       O'Dubhain            | "The Book of Ballymote" by a 7th century
Culddean Druid<G>, Jehana also in Religion lib.
       Jehana               | okay, odubh.
       Beth Campbell        | send 2 what's Palyne? Is this a formal co?
       O'Dubhain            | yes Beth?  The way Druids worked Magick
was by "becoming" or by actually changing reality A classic example of
this is The Song of Amergin the Druid who aided the Gaels in defeating 
the Tuatha de Danaans.  I quote from his song:
                                  | "I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                                  | I am the wave of the ocean.
                                  | I am the murmur of the billows.
                                  | I am the ox of the seven combats.
                                  | I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                                  | I am a beam of the Sun.
                                  | I am the fairest of plants.
                                  | I am a wild boar in valour.
                                  | I am a salmon in the water.
                                  | I am a lake in the plain.
                                  | I am a word of science.
                                  | I am a point of a lance in battle.
                                  | I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                                  | Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                                  | in the mountain?
                                  | Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                                  | Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
                                  | If not I?
       Jehana               | I think this song is a teaching ballad.  
       O'Dubhain            | I invoke the land of Ireland!"
       Jehana               | by the way, whose translation is this?  
       O'Dubhain            | Yes it teaches and it invokes the power of
the Land.  This was the translation by Douglas Hyde.
       Jehana               | okay, just simply because it is slightly
different than the one i remembr.
       O'Dubhain            | This Spell was used by the Druid to
overcome the winds raised by the de Danaans in their battle for the
Land.  It is an example of the way a Druid would work.  There are other
tales of shamanistic workings by Druids
       Freepowder           | ?
       O'Dubhain            | Among these is "How the Tain was Recover-
ed" Yes FP?
       Freepowder           | you spoke of becoming, is Amergin actualy
3149

becoming... those things or, has he been in the past?
       Nan                  | or is it a metaphor?
       O'Dubhain            | He is actually synchronizing himself with
the spirit that controls these items.  It is a series of symbols. It can
be viewed metaphorically.  But the fact is it got results.  The wind
died and the Gaels landed on Ireland.
       Freepowder           | ok GA
       O'Dubhain            | Present day shamans do the same thing. 
The story of the Tain was lost and had to be recovered.  It had been
written in Oghams on sticks and sent to Italy.  None of the bards had a
memory of the entire story, so they sent two men to recover the Oghams,
Senchan and Muirgen.  No one knew where to look for these Ogham sticks. 
So Muirgen decided to ask Fergus mac Roich (only one problem---Fergus
was dead) So Muirgen slept on his grave and invoked the ghost of Fergus
to reveal the entire story.  The Spirit of Fergus appeared in a cloud
and for three days recited the entire epic.  Muirgen was able to go back
to the Bards and tell the entire tale.  This tale was written down and
we have it today.  This is an example of dream traveling to discover
hidden knowledge
       Artemisia            | ?
       O'Dubhain            | yes Artemisia?
       Artemisia            | sorry...computer fart
       O'Dubhain            | hahahaha! ok
       Jehana               | <rofl>
       Sue Thornburg        | <snork>
       Freepowder           | <LTB>
       O'Dubhain            | mine was getting constipated!<G>
       Freepowder           | *maismic*
       Jehana               | LTB?  lettuce, tomato and bacon?
       O'Dubhain            | haha!
       Nan                  | lol
       O'Dubhain            | gotta be! <wiping eyes> Anyway the point
is Druids did Magick in a lot of ways that has to be discovered again
from studying these tales.  Native Americans pass this kind of know-
ledge down from teacher to student.  We are not so lucky. We have to dig
it out of books and figure out the symbolisms!
       Sue Thornburg        | Unless we have an O'Dubh and a computer.
:)
       Artemisia            | :-)
       O'Dubhain            | <taking a bow> But not for speed typing!-
<G> or typos!:(To take a Journey on Fionn's Wheel, I suggest One study
the Paths as outlined in Workshop #1 in Library 16 here as CLTWS1.TXT.
       Beth Campbell        | <g> Does this mean ... those who don't
respect the past are doomed to repeat it?
       Jehana               | only if it was a "bad" past <g>.
       Freepowder           | *maismic*
       Sue Thornburg        | <chortle>
       O'Dubhain            | I think we all get our turn in the
"barrel"!<G>
       Jehana               | sorry.
       O'Dubhain            | The first Path according to my inner
vision
       Beth Campbell        | wrong choice of words (sorry) (must be
mercury) going to repeat it
       O'Dubhain            | and as based upon the Oghams in Nigel
Pennicks "Magical Alphabets" is the Way of Protection.  This Way has the
Oghams B L F S N on it from the outside to the center.  Each Ogham on
this Path teaches us a Magickal ability.  The first Ogham B stands for
3150

the tree Birch--The White Tree of Purity and Purification.
       Jehana               | B is birch in the norse runes, too.  
       O'Dubhain            | It is used to protect and Purify us before
we start our journey within.  It was the first Ogham ever used. It
warned Lugh that his wife was going to be abducted to the Underworld and
it will serve to show us that we are protected. Life springs anew.  To
make such a journey one should meditate and cleanse oneself of all
unclean and impure thoughts. 
      Beth Campbell        | (sounds like Eve and the Apple)
       O'Dubhain            | Native Americans might do this in a "sweat
lodge".  more of a putting away of the mundane bagage of life. baggage
that is !<G>  Make an Out of Body (OOBE) type of Journey to a White tree
shining against a totally Black Darkness.  Use its image to purge your
mind of distracting thoughts and go to the next level ---The Tree of
Life.  Upon this tree one learns to shield unwanted psychic energies and
Magicks. This Ogham is "L" for Rowan. When one is floating in an OOBE
one needs such shielding to travel safely.
       Freepowder           | ?
       O'Dubhain            | The next symbol in our journey is --"The
Red Man". FP ga
       Freepowder           | sould it be too long to cover their
protection in a bit more detail?
       O'Dubhain            | It would take an entire workshop.
       Freepowder           | thought so, <G> GA
       Artemisia            | :-)
       O'Dubhain            | I'll cover this with a post on the Section
15 message board.
       Nan                  | 15 or 16?
       O'Dubhain            | The Red Man or the Fear Dearg is a
Supernatural being
       Jehana               | how about a library file?
       O'Dubhain            | that is a fire entity. That too Jehana!<G>
He sometimes will rescue us from the Other forces of the Underworld. 
His Ogham is the Alder Tree.  Fp ga
       Freepowder           | the whistle tree!<G>
       O'Dubhain            | Ah!  Perhaps the whistle will lead us from
the Underworld!?<G>
       Fea'dog              | it does me!
       O'Dubhain            | Red is the color of life and frees us from
conflicts and shields us in our lives.  Once we are pure and can shield
and have no inner conflicts, it is time to learn of Magick itself!  The
next step or Ogham is The Moon.  It is the letter "S" for the White
Willow.  This is a form of the Goddess and leads us in Divinations to
guide our future travels on the Wheel.  The last or inner Ogham on this
path is "N".  It represents the Keys to inner Knowledge that we have
gained.  It is the Black Ash.
       Rachel               | hello
       O'Dubhain            | It also gives us the insight "as Above so
Below".
       Jehana               | hello.
       Rachel               | what is the subject?
       O'Dubhain            | All our previous insights will aid us in
the physical and the astral worlds.  Rachel, this is a Workshop on
Celtic Magick.  These keys and knowledge must grow like seeds within us. 
In the future, they allow us to work our Power, the Earth's Power and
the Power of the Spirit.  This completes the Way of Protection. I
suggest that each of you try such a journey on your own, in a Circle or
Safe quiet place.  Learn the symbols for the Oghams from the tables in
3151

the library (there are about 7 there I think).  Shamanistic journeys are
very individualized.  Use symbols that have meaning to You.  To complete
the journey around Fionns Wheel would cover the entire year and the
Major festivals. 
       Nan                  | is that the next workshop, the festivals?
<g>
       O'Dubhain            | Really project yourselves into the Wheel
and you will find your own inner guide and Truth.
       Beth Campbell        | (sorry)
       O'Dubhain            | Nan>I think that'd be a good one The Major
festivals are Imbolc Beltane Lughnasadh Samhain The Solstices and the
Equinoxes Each of these can be found on the Wheel.  I hope that I wasn't
too sketchy on this!<G>
       Nan                  | this medium is a bit slow and time
consuming to cover this kind of stuff
       O'Dubhain            | I know my typing can stand improvement.
       Artemisia            | You were very good...<sigh> but I don't
think I'm ever going to get this. 
       O'Dubhain            | John Matthews covers shamanism fully in
his Book
       Nan                  | can you pre-type any and use cut and
paste, that might help
       O'Dubhain            | "Celtic Shamanism". I could but then we
lose spontaneity and dialogue.
       Nan                  | we could still be spontaneous in the
discussion, but the information portion we're all being quiet anyway
       O'Dubhain            | Hey!  Ok! Next time lends itself to
uploading on the festivals. <g>  I would like you each to consider

hiding in there!?

       Pietra               | They would say so
       Artemisia            | it seems like they take from several
traditions
       O'Dubhain            | Some of these societies formed about the
same time as a rebirth of interest in the occult and Druids.
       Pietra               | It is interesting that along with some of
the rest of us the inquisistion tortured and put to death all Masons
they could find.
       O'Dubhain            | Might have members in both paths.
       Artemisia            | hmmmm
       Pietra               | they certainly do --I am one
       O'Dubhain            | Sounds like they were intent on eliminat-
ing anyone that thought for themselves.  Might have to talk to my uncles
about this.  They are Masons.  But those guys are very secretive ! Just
like Druids!<G>
       Pietra               | Oh good
       Artemisia            | Yes, they are <G>

CELTIC WORKSHOP 3 - CELTIC FESTIVALS

This an edited transcript of the Third Celtic Workshop presented by
Searles O'Dubhain. The topic for the evening was scheduled to be
the Major Celtic yearly festivals and their hidden meanings. Oghams
were used to attempt to discovery the magick and Mystery within each
festival.

(2-9,Bianca)    hi jehana 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) The Celts celebrated 8 major festivals during the year.
Four of these festivals are associated with the Sun and four are tied to
the phases of the Moon.
 
I will briefly discuss the Lunar or Fire Festivals first.
 
The Celtic year is divided into halves marked by the two great fire
festivals of Samhain and Beltane. The period from Samhain to Beltain
is(2-9,Bianca) sid and mindy called "an Ghrian beag" or the "lessor
Sun".  The period from Beltain to Samhain is called "an Ghrian mor" or
the "greater Sun". The year is further subdivided by the other two
yearly fire festivals of Imbolc and Lughnesadh.All of the fire festivals
are celebrated at night and are held during the Full Moon. They are
primarily concerned with agriculture, nature, pasturing and livestock. 
 
(2-1,Freepowder)?  
                
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Samhain is the begining of the Celtic year and marks the
time of the Cailleach and the begining of Winter. The doors of the Sidhe
are opened on this night and the veil between the Worlds is thinnest.
This is the night that Druids offered sacrifices (usually the excess
cattle that would form the basis of the Winter's meat stores). This is
the time that the Ancestors walk the Earth once more and cross the thin
veil to visit with the living. Samhain is associated with the province
of Munster and the fortress of Tlachtga.
                 
Beltane marks the begining of Summer and is dedicated to the "Shining
One:" or Bel. Two large bonfires were ignited and cattle were driven
between the fires and into the fields for Summer pasturing. This was
also done to purify them from their long Winter confinement. Men and
women were known to leap through the flames for purification at these
fire festivals.  Usually the men first then the women (and after the
flames had diminished!<g>).  This night is the time when the Sidhe walk 
the land and mortals must overcome their Otherworldly enchantments and
temptations.   Beltane was the time when divorces were granted in
Ireland as well as a night of release from the Winter. This festival was
3156

associated with the province of Connacht and the fortress of Uisneach.
 
In ancient Ireland an additional two fire festivals were celebrated:
Lughnasadh and the feast of Tara (celebrated every 3 years).
 
Lughnasadh was the time of the first harvest and a time of games and
competitions. It is associated with the Goddess of Sovereignty.  The God
Lugh held this festival to celibrate the efforts of his fostermother
Tailtiu to clear the fields of Ireland for planting.  It was also the
time when couples could enter into a "trial marriage" known as a Brehon 
wedding. The couple would clasp hands and thrust them through a circular
opening in a special stone, while announcing to the Brehons (judges and
lawyers) that they intended to live together for a one year trial
period. Either party could break the marriage by a public announcement
during the feast of Beltane. This festival lasted for a month! The feast
of Tara was held every three years to distribute laws and gather
records.
 
An additional festival was added later.  This is Imbolc and was held in
Leinster to celebrate the Goddess Brigit. This festival marks the ending
of Winter's grip and the passing of the influence of the Crone or
Cailleach to the Maiden of Spring. It is the time of the first lambs and
of new beginings. Brigit's sacred flame was tended in Leinster in a
sacred center for female Druids. This festival was usually one of the
home and the hearth and was usually presided  over by the female head of
the house.
 
The Sun festivals are MidWinter and MidSummer Solstices as well as the
Spring and Vernal Equinoxes. These festivals mark periods of greatest
imbalance between the Sun and the Moon as well as the periods of
greatest balance. Not much is known about how these Sun festivals were
celebrated by the Celts, if at all. One source I've read claims they 
are evidence of Anglo-Saxon influences on later Celtic life and
practice. Most authors state that only the lunar festivals were publicly
celebrated (at least by the Irish).  Perhaps the Druids used the Solar
days for Magick and Divination. I am still researching these celebrat-
ions and am not prepared to discuss them in detail this evening.
 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Perhaps we should discuss the previous presentation
before we get to the Magickal meaning of the Lunar festivals?
 
FP>ga
(2-1,Freepowder)you answered it <G>
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Ok I know this was a long spiel but now we can discuss
it.
     The following pieces are much shorter with more room for discussion
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  FP>ga
(2-29,Nan)       ?
(2-1,Freepowder)the festivals I have herard of samhain etc. are solar?
(2-1,Freepowder)but not agreed upon?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  The Solar festivals are not really ancient Celtic
public festivals.
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-3,Pietra)     !
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Samhain is a lunar festival.  But More research must be
done on the Solar festivals. ga FP
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Are the Solar festivals mentioned at all in Greek or
3157

Roman chronicles as Celtic festival days?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Kenneth >Will get to that question in a minute.
                 Fp>done?
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>ga
(2-29,Nan)      two questions, how are the lunar holidays determined
(dates) and what is the connection of 
(2-29,Nan)      the Sidhe with Beltane?
(2-29,Nan)      ga
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>I'll answer those in the following presentation.
Pietra>ga       ok
(2-3,Pietra)    didn't the people also jump the bonfires?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Pietra>Yes they did. And sometimes they were sacrificed
in them But that was very long ago.  The Human sacrifice was replaced by
animal and agricultural sacrifices.
Kenneth>The Romans influenced the Britains and also the Vikings and
Anglo-Saxons  This is where the Sun festivals come from although they
could have been Druid ceremonies closed to the public.
Kenneth>ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Hmmm...I see.  So as far as readily evident public
festival information goes, 
(2-17,Kenneth 23)the Solar festivals are recent -- at least in the sense
of "post-Roman?"
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>Yes I believe so. These festivals are part of
the Wiccan year.  Because Wicca embraces soo many diff backgrounds and
deities.  anyway I'm going to talk a little about the Magickal sig-
nificance of these holidays and festivals now.  We will use the Oghams
from Fionn's Wheel to get an inkling of what was really going on during
these festivals.  Any other questions before I start?

ok From the "Crane Bag" of Mannanan mac Lyr The Festival of Imbolc
(First Full Moon in Aquarius) The Feast of the Goddess Brigit.
 
                Ogham Symbol "EA":
                Koad or Eadha the Sacred Grove

                forty shades of green.
 
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
     This is the festival of new beginings.  This is the time when most
new life came forth (first shoots of spring, lambs and the childern that
were sired at Beltain).  A celebration of the Triple Goddess, showing
the passage of winter and the advent of summer. The Time of the Maiden
who bridges the gap from the Dark Queen of the UnderWorld to the Red
Mother of Life and Plenty.  The Mystery here is the unity of Death and
Life through the Promise of the rebirth of the Green World as represen-
ted by Brigit, the Maiden of the hearth, the home, poets and the forge.
Imbolc is the time of divination, augury and seeking of new directions
for the year.  I believe that Imbolc is a carry over from an earlier
Goddess religion in Ireland.
                Discussion or questions anyone?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) FP>ga
(2-1,Freepowder)Brigit did poets, who did musicians? <G>
3158

(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Well the Dagdha played a mean harp.  And Lugh was
multi-talented.
(2-1,Freepowder)LOL 
(2-1,Freepowder)no "patron saint" of musicians?
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Well Taliesin was the king of Bards And was the greatest
of musicians as well.  So he would be your God of Musicians.
(2-1,Freepowder)he was welsh! Amergin maybe? <G> 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Amergin was also a great bard.  He seems to be Talies-
in's counterpart.  Ok on to Betaine!

                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
This is the festival of life. On this day, the sacred fires were lit on
the hill of Tara. Fires were lit on hills across Ireland when the signal
fire was observed until the land was surrounded in a circle of fire.
Beltain marks the begining of summer when the land is filled with
plenty. This a time when the ways between the worlds are open and the
Sidhe are most likely to grant gifts to those who seek them early in the 
morning. It is also a time that is central to the entire cycle of
agriculture. It is now when the promise of spring is fulfilled. The
Maypole symbolises the fertility rites of this festival. Strange that
the red and white streamers of the Maypole should remind us of the DNA
Helix of Life. Life is the Spindle and Love is the weave. In Ireland
the people dance around a burning bush in a "serpent" dance. Beltaine is
the time of our maturity and the fulfillment of desires.
 
                Questions or should I go on?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) FP>ga
(2-1,Freepowder)Bel was the god of the dead?...
(2-1,Freepowder)and this was a festival of life? GA
(2-1,Freepowder)<G> Ok
(2-7,O'Dubhain) There is controversy over whether Belenus is really the
God for whom this festival is named.  But Belenus, Bael, Bile and Beil
are all names associted with this festival. Some of theses are Sun Gods
eg "Shining Ones" Irish sources say this that Beltaine really means
Great Fires!<G>
(2-29,Nan)      ?  Nan>ga
(2-5,JUAN)      HELLO EVERYBODY
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Juan Standby please Co in progress
(2-29,Nan)      what if there's no Hawthorn around? how do you know when
this festival is?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>It's commonly called May Day in Western Europe.
That's May 1 or the closet Full Moon to May 1.
(2-29,Nan) ok
(2-7,O'Dubhain) That's the first full moon in Taurus.
(2-17,Kenneth 23)?
3159

(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Beltane seems to be characterized by masculine symbols
-- was it a special day for men, such as entrance to manhood festivals,
or such?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>It was a day of festivities for both men and
women It's also associated with the first Battle of Moytura.  Women and
men both fought in that battle.
(2-17,Kenneth 23)<nod> Was there any particular ascent to adulthood
ritual in Celtic festivities?
(2-17,Kenneth 23)I see...
(2-7,O'Dubhain) All the festivals were used as rites of initiation since
this was a time of gathering of the clans.  many times a boy would be
initiated by graduating from warrior training or bardic training he
could then demonstrate his prowess.  
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Ah...I see.  So anything involving community could be
done on those days (including Bhar Mitzvas :D)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Something like that! and also lots of games and
competitions.

                The Festival of Lughnasadh
                (First Full Moon in Leo)
                The Feast of the God Lugh.
 
                Ogham Symbol "UI":
                Uinllean Fea' Ffawyddean Beech or Phagos.
                Chieftain.
                Magickal Hardness and Resistance.
                Ancient Wisdom as a foundation.
                Tawny or light roebuck.
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
This festival is linked to many ancient practices in Ireland. Contracts,
marriages and other binding agreements were made on this day. This is
the day of the Marriage of Lugh. It is also the day when the performance
of the clan chiefs was evaluated and perhaps a new chief was chosen.
This is the time of the great horse fair and fittingly enough the
marriage of the King to the land. This could sometimes involve a ritual
whereby the new king was symbollically mated with a horse, Symbolizing
the Goddess of Sovereignty. The first harvest had already been reaped.
 
                Ogham Symbol "IO":
                Pethbol Guelder Rose
                The step into the Inner Mysteries.
                Pink or Pale.
                The dance of life.
                The Crane Dance.
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
Since this festival is linked to the young god Lugh that replaces the
older god Nuada, it is also linked to the mysteries as Lugh is "Samil-
danach" or "multi-talented". It is very possible that a series of
examinations was given to Druidic students on this day, corresponding to
3160

the series of tests that Lugh had to pass in competitions with the other
Gods before he was admitted to their company. One such contest is in the
throwing of stones or chariot wheels that occurred during the weeks of
this fair. Another is the playing of board games at this time such as
"fidchell", a game played with wooden pieces (possibly Oghams) and
similar we are told to chess. My own opinion is that it was a kind of
divination. The point here being that just as Lugh proved himself worthy
to join the company of the Gods by being "Samildanach", so I interpret
this symbol to imply that new Druids were admitted to the  inner
mysteries and Circles by passing their tests during this festival.
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Questions?
(2-17,Kenneth 23)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth!>ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Sorry...just one little thing I've always wondered --
Fidchell, and games like it in other celtic groups, are mentioned
frequently in literature and legend.  Are there any surviving fidchell
sets?  How is information known about the game?

(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>Not much is known about the game.  No sets
survive but it must have been something!  Everyone was playing it!<G>
more? ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)No...that's all, thanks!
(2-1,Freepowder)O'D? GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) ok

                From the "Crane Bag" of Mannanan mac Lyr
 
 
                The Festival of Samhain
                (First Full Moon in Scorpio)
                Ogham Symbol "AE":
                Amancholl, Mor, Xi, Pe'ine, The Scotch Pine.
                Shower of the Way.
                Marker of the Ley Lines.
                Bringer of Illumination.
                The Container of Wisdom,
                The Sacred Pine Cone, Buarci'n.
                Spirit.
                The Sea. Green or Black.
 
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
There are many meanings to this symbol. The first is the Sea represen-
ting the darkest depths and also the source of all life.  The mystery
here is that as life ends, so it begins in the same place and from the
same source, the Sea (or Otherworld for which it is a symbol).  This
celebration honored the Night of the Dead, when the ancestors walked the
Earth once more and the ancient knowledge could be re-acquired.  It also
celebrated the mating of the Dagdha with the Morrigan, the Queen of
Death and Darkness, the Washer at the Ford. She gives the Dagdha the 
advice to assemble the Aes Dana or skilled ones and to advance upon the
Fomorians at Maige Turedh. The Goddess of War then goes to kill the King
of the Fomorians (Indech mac De Domnann) in his tent at Scetne. The
Second Battle of Maige Turedh (Moytura) is won by the De Danaans on
Samhain.  I interpret this story of the Dagdha (The All Father)with the
Goddess of Darkness (The Triple Morrigan) to mean that the will of the
One was united in the Power of Dark and Light to be used during this
3161

"gray time" of twilight. The Spiritual aspects overcome the Mental and
Physical aspects (the Fomorians and  the Firbolgs, defeated in the first
Battle of Maige Turedh) to claim the Land and ALL that is. The victory
of the Spirit assures us that the Wheel will turn eternally and that the
three aspects of humanity are forged together through the two battles of
Maige Turedh. Please read Steve Blamires's excellent interpretations in
his work "The Irish Celtic Magical Tradition". This last marriage of the
Dagdha and Morrigan also represents the mystery of life from death. 
I believe that to be the Ultimate Mystery of Druidism or any other
religion.
(2-7,O'Dubhain) questions?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Fp>ga
(2-1,Freepowder)did the Irish believe in reincarnation? GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Yes they did. They believed that when you were re-incar-
nated, it would hold true to the bloodlines.  Like maybe you are your
great grandfather or grand mother re-incarnated!<G>
(2-1,Freepowder)not "karmic" then?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Not a great deal of karma there.  They did hold each
accountable for their life's actions.  
(2-1,Freepowder)what about if you are adopted? <VBG>
(2-7,O'Dubhain) he Irish also believed in "fosterage" so that you became
"blood brothers".  So I suppose you could re-incarnate in someone else
that way!<G>

(2-8,O'Dubh) Before I begin let me say a few words about how the
Workshop is conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight
that is me. If you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge
you by tyoing "ga" at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your
question type "ga" to let me know that I may respond. When
we are finished I will acknowledge the next questioner in a similar
manner. If you have a comment or additional information to provide
on a topic, please use the "!" to signal me.  I will also cycle through
those with comments in a similar manner. If their are no questions at
this point I will begin tonight's presentation.
(2-5,Seanchai) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
 
3165

                Music and Magick in general.
                Role of Bards and Druids in Celtic Music.
                Aradach Fionn, Tree tones and associations
                Some example folk songs and interpretations.
(2-8,O'Dubh)   Seanchai ga.
(2-5,Seanchai) Patience is a virtue I need to learn in a hurry.
(2-5,Seanchai) I was going to ask, what's tonight's topic.
(2-8,O'Dubh)   ok !<G>
(2-5,Seanchai) Ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n)  LOL!
(2-11,Nan)     lol
(2-9,Rose)     ditto

(2-8,O'Dubh) Anyone that has ever done Magick knows that it involves
resonances and associations.  Magick has many color associations as well
as musical associations. We have all experienced the magick of music in
contemporary music. Sometimes this can be in the form of attending
a concert, othertimes it can be when we are alone and listening to our
favorites tunes.  Modern day religious services take advantage of the
Magick inherit to music to enhance their worship services. This can be
in singing hymns or hearing organ and choral anthems. I'm sure that we
will all agree that music in such sitruarions alters our state of being.
We are uplifted and changed by the ritual music we experience.  It
should be no surprise that the ancient Celts used music in a similar
manner.  In Morgan Llwellyn's "Druids" we find an example of such a
Druidic use of music in Magick.  The chief Druid of a village would
greet the Sun with song and lead the village each day in welcoming the
Sun back from the Underworld.  When the Sun set, another farewell song
was enjoined. This practice is still followed by some in Celtic lands to
this day. Examples of such incantations and greetings to the Sun
may be found in the "Carmenica Gadetica" a vast resources of ancient and
rercent Celtic verse and song.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Please pardon the typos!<G>  In many Magick systems, Words
of Power using the names of the Gods are used to create resonances
within the Magical Circle so that the Magicians may attain a higher
state of awareness. The use of these words also serves to open the
internal "Power Centers" or "Chakras" of the participants.  These
godnames are constructed using the letters of the Magickal alphabets of
the respective Magickal systems as well as the natural tones  and the
corresponding resonances that are associated with each letter or symbol.
             For example:
        
                YHVH Yud Heh Vahv He  
                (a Kaballistic godname)
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) An incantaion of a godname becomes a chant with its own
inherent melody and rhythm. Such sounds generated form an occult
alphabet are thought by Magicians to have inherit Power in their sounds
and to generate Magickal resonances within the Magician and the Circle.
It is my belief that the ancient Celts and Druids used music and sounds
from their secret Ogham alphabet to aid them in working Magick in a
similar manner.  
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the
epics, chants, spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These
works were memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to
a higher or inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be 
3166

rendered with feeling so that the listener  would be spell bound and
consequently could relive the event.  The Irish Druids had the following
classes of Bards:

(2-8,O'Dubh) Bards learned to play the pipes, the whistle, the harp, the
lyre, the flute, the sistrum and the bodrun among other instruments.
According to Murry Hope these instruments, were used based upon the mood
or tone that the particular Bardic work required. He gives a table of
the following correspondences:
        
                    The Flute   -  Air   (later the Organ)
                    The Harp    -  Water
                    The Sistrum -  Earth (The Bells or Bodrun)
                    The Lyre    -  Fire
 
Poets and Bards carried branches with bells and amulets attached to
them. A beginner's branch would be bronze, journeymen carried a silver
branch and the Master Bards carried a golden branch. The music of the
bells would announce the Bard's presence and an impending performance.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   what's a sistrum?
(2-11,Nan)   ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) It's a stringed instrument that one beats I believe. 
Anyone got an opinion?
(2-2,Rilla)  Ray confirms that.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-2,Rilla)  Precursor of the lute maybe?
(2-8,O'Dubh) perhaps.
(2-9,Rose)   I understand that one shakes it like Isis does in the
pictures.
(2-22,Wren)  Similar to a hammered dulcimer?
(2-8,O'Dubh) That's what I was thinking, Wren.
(2-11,Nan)   or a tambourine?
(2-9,Rose)   I have a picture of one...
(2-8,O'Dubh) Rose ga
(2-9,Rose)   it looks like a tennis racket.
(2-9,Rose)   with hooks.
(2-8,O'Dubh) And you beat it right?
(2-9,Rose)   I think so.
(2-8,O'Dubh) ok Nan any further questions?
(2-11,Nan)   got it, thanks
(2-9,Rose)   shake it.
(2-20,O'Ba'n)an ancient metal frame with numerous metal rods that jingle
when shaken, websters.
(2-9,Rose)   bravo.
(2-8,O'Dubh) great! 
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-11,Nan)    no, ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n?
3167

(2-8,O'Dubh)  ok let's roll!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) wait
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ban ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) are the instruments dedicated to...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) their various areas based on the tonal range they cover
or...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) the quality of the sound?
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  It's the quality of the sound mostly.  The same way they
would be scored in an orchestra for instance.  
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ok.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) no, you ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) <G>|
(2-8,O'Dubh) My own belief is that the Bards usually accompanied
themselves with the harp as they recited their repertorie. Just as
Oghams were used as keys to memory with verses being linked by assonance
and alliteration, I believe that each Ogham had a unique tone or note
associated with it on the harp.  The tone or string was struck as the
Ogham sound was spoken or sung two notes per line.  The begining and
ending notes serving to connect each line to the next line in a
continuing stream.  In the world of my my imagination I can hear the
tones and words of the Bards echoing as they float upon a wave of melody
acroos the room.  The sound reminds me of chanting monks or the 
plainsong of worship (similar to modern Anglican or Roman Catholic
Plainsong).
(2-8,O'Dubh) Sean O'Boyle, a late Irish scholar, made an attempt to
interpret "Aradach Fionn" (Fionn's Ladder) as harp tabulature using
Oghams. He suggested that the Irish practice harp that has only 20
strings has a 1 to 1 correspondence to the first 20 Oghams. As far as I
know,no records survived to reach us verifying his theory. It seems to
make sense to me but I only speculate.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) A modern work "Trees for Healing" by Chase and Pawlik,
reinforces this belief for me. This book is all about trees, their lore
and their spirits. It describes techniques for meditation to determine
the harmonic resonaces for a variety of trees. I believe that the
ancient Druids also detected certain harmonic tones for each tree and
used then in their Tree Ogham Alphabet. If we use the tones that have
been rediscovered by Chase and Pawlik and combine them with the ancient
chants, incantations and songs of Taliesin and Amergin, we may also be
able to work powerful Magicks. This Magick can take any form from
enchanting an audience to calling the winds.  The Greek Bard Orpheus was
able to walk between the worlds in this manner and so can we.  I list
the trees and the derived modern tonal correspondences below:

(2-8,O'Dubh) Some of these tones were derived by meditation and
resonance, some are based upon the colors associated with the Oghams. My
suggestion is to
(2-11,Nan)   ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) find such a tree yourself and to meditate under it. play a
pipe, a whistle or a harp (even a guitar will do in a pinch!<G>) until
you find 
(2-22,Wren)  ?
(2-20,O'Ba'n)?
3169

             the correct tone for the tree.  Other tones will reflect
from the tree.  The "soul tone" of the tree will be absorbed and you
will possibly feel a tingle of energy that is released by the Spirit of
the Tree.  This experience is somewhat akin to the common belief in
Ireland (even today) that a particularily gifted musician, harper or
piper has been taught by the Sidhe (famed for their enchanted music).
Celts believe in harmony and rightness in all things and particularily
in Nature.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   I noticed that many different oghams had the same note...
are these the same notes or are they in differing octaves? ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) The table I presented is not cast in stone!<G>
(2-11,Nan)   or even in wood? <G> 
(2-8,O'Dubh) The first approach has each ogham on a different tone For
Fionn's ladder for instance.  The second approach used meditation
techniques to determine the "soul tones" of the trees Some trees
evidently have a similar feel to them.  I think that the table needs
some work myself.  Perhaps one of the more musically gifted members
could undertake such a study!
(2-24,da Medic) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) ?<G>
(2-8,O'Dubh) ga Nan
(2-8,O'Dubh) additional questions?
(2-8,O'Dubh) If not then Wren was next.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) !
(2-11,Nan)   no, i think wren had some though
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Wren ga
(2-22,Wren)   Already answered, thanks.  Gotta go, g'nite!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Sla'n Wren!
(2-11,Nan)    g'night wren
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) need to have the transmogrification of what tree is which
out west for me to do it...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) but with that I'd love to do the tree/tone thing!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Ok I'll put a table in the library this week.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-24,da Medic) does this explain the prevalence of willow/oak in celtic
magicks?  ga.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Cool!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) sorry, saw the ga.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Yes it does to some extent.  I have entire books on nothing
but healing properties of trees.  I'm sure Druids knew much more.
(2-11,Nan) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   could you please post a bibliography of some of those
books??? (pretty please?)
(2-11,Nan)   ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) Ok will do that as well this week!<G>
(2-20,O'Ba'n) yes! yes!

(2-8,O'Dubh) Now to continue...
             Some of this Magick comes down to us today in the form of
folk songs still sung in the outer reaches of Ireland and the British
Isles.  Such a song is the "Padstow May Song" from  Padstow, Cornwall
(in part):
 

3170

                "Unite and unite and let us unite
                For summer is acome unto day
                And whither we are going we will all unite
                In the merry morning of May."
 
                "I warn you young men everyone
                To go into the greenwood and 
                fetch your May home."
 
                "Arise up Mr. _______ and joy you betide
                And bright is your bride that lies 
                by your side."
 
                "Arise up Mrs. _______ and gold be your ring
                And give to us a cup of ale the merrier 
                we shall sing."
 
                "Arise up Miss ______ all in your gown of green
                You are as fine a lady as wait upon the Queen."
 
                "Now fare you well, and we bid you 
                all good cheer

                We call once more unto your house 
                before another year."

(2-8,O'Dubh) I interpret this song to mean this:
 
             This song is sung on Beltaine and is said to 
             charge the atmosphere of the festival. It 
             symbolizes the marriage of the youth with
             the land. (Unite and unite and let us unite)
 
             It also adresses 3 individuals: A man, a
             woman and a Maiden in a green gown
             (who represents Nature).
 
             This song is sung around the May Pole or   
             May bonfires in the evening (and prior to
             anyone escaping to the outer folds of 
             darkness for an evening of bliss <g>).

様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様
3171

(2-8,O'Dubh) Another ancient folk song that has hidden meanings of
Magick is the song "Green Grow the Rushes":
 
             " One of them is all alone and 
             ever more shall be so.
             Two of them are lily-white boys 
             all clothed all in green Oh!
             Three of them are strangers o'er the 
             wide world they are rangers.
             Four it is the Dilly Hour when 
             blooms the Gilly Flower.
             Five it is the Dilly Bird that's 
             seldom seen but heard.
             Six is the Ferryman in the boat that 
             o'er the river floats, Oh!
             Seven are the Seven Stars in the Sky, 
             the Shining Stars be Seven, Oh!
             Eight it is the Morning's break when 
             all the World's awake, Oh!
             Nine it is the pale Moonshine, 
             the shining Moon is nine, Oh!
             Ten Forgives all kinds of Sin, 
             from Ten begin again, Oh! "
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) This song can be interpreted to mean:
 
             1. There is One Power.
 
             2. The God has two aspects (Light and Dark).
 
             3. The Celts are a wadering people with
                the sacred number of "3".
 
             4. The 4th Ogham is the Alder sacred to Bran
                the Blessed and his sister Branwen "the
                Gilly Flower".
 
             5. The Wizard Merlin as well as the sacred
                number of the Celtic Gods (not to mention
                the number of points on a Pentagram).
 
             6. Keridwen's Coracle that ferries us to
                the Underworld.
 
             7. The sacred number of sea gods and the stars
                in the crown of Arianrhod.
 
             8. The number of judgement or resurrection.
 
             9. The Triple Moon Goddess Thrice emphasized
                The number of Priestesses that guard the 
                Cauldron of Rebirth.
 
             10.The necessity to find our "True Selves"
                in order to understand the Inner Mysteries. 
                The endless cycle of death and rebirth.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Everone still awake?<G>
3172

(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-2,Rilla)   <I am!>
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'Ba'n ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) this is your interpretation? 
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-8,O'Dubh)  It is also Murry Hope's interpretation.  I have seen a
different version of this song.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) <patting self on back> suits me! GA
(2-8,O'Dubh)  that is used by OATh coven and had hoped that perhaps they
would be here tonight.
(2-24,da Medic) !

(2-8,O'Dubh) da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) Cunningham also had summat similar ga.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Which book?
             ga
(2-24,da Medic) Not sure, will check & advise, methinks in Earth Air
Fire water ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) Ok I have that one here will check in a min.  let's finish
up a bit first!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Perhaps some of you have some ancient or even modern Celtic
folk songs that you would like to share with us this evening? You could
enter them here and we could discuss them in detail or maybe just take
them to our hearts and embrace their inner messages (for Celtic Music is
a music of the Heart and Soul). I know that many of you are very into
Celtic Music. I'd like to have each of us contribute the names and
titles of our favorite performers and songss.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) My favorite song is the "Rising Of the Moon" by the Clancy
Brothers and Tommy Liam.
 
(2-24,da Medic) !
(2-8,O'Dubh) da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) Joe doughterty's lament, black 47
(2-24,da Medic) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) ok ! Others?
(2-20,O'Ba'n) <embarrased> all mine deal with young maidens getting
taken advantage of or with drinking, mostly poiti'n (e.g.Cruiscean lan)
(2-11,Nan)   !
(2-8,O'Dubh) hahaha LOL O'Ba'n !!

the more interesting is "the Tain" by Horselips ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) neat nan!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Do you know Ben phagin? I have it but no translation, also
the well below the valley o!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Most Celtic songs I've heard always have a hidden meaning
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-8,O'Dubh) un minuto OB!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Adam question? ga
(2-26,Adam)  OD, I lost some of your send  :P  Which is your favorite
song?
(2-8,O'Dubh) Adam> My favorite song is the Rising of the Moon.  by the
Clancy Brothers and Tommy Liam.

(2-26,Adam)  thanks  :)
(2-8,O'Dubh) OB>Have that one as well.
(2-8,O'Dubh) OB ga
(2-24,da Medic)  gotta go do the work thing-Blesed Be! ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) that one is all about english occupation and resistance as
related to a duck <G>
(2-11,Nan)    lol
(2-8,O'Dubh)  OB>I know it well (it's about a goose I thought)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) how 'bout 5 (or 7) nights drunk!
(2-11,Nan)    ?
(2-8,O'Dubh)  But it's really about a man that was killed by the
English.  They had to sing it in riddles to avoid being hanged.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) O'D> and how we has plenty of relatives to take up the
fight!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  That's right. I am reading Trinity right now.  about the
fight for home rule.
(2-8,O'Dubh)  more favorites out there?
(2-4,Da Shad) OD, went to an Irish festival this weekend...
(2-2,Rilla)  <great book!>
(2-4,Da Shad) and was really shocked at how strong a presense that the
IRA had there, several booths for signing petitions and sending money to
the IRA.  Pledges even!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) "bad luck to the savage to grease his white cabbage that
wantonly murdered me beautiful drake" BTW Drakes are male ducks...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Ganders are male geese <G>
(2-11,Nan) <---going to the Chieftans next w'end <VBG>
(2-20,O'Ba'n) <green>
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Da Shad>They need to do something settle the issues up
there.
(2-8,O'Dubh)  OB>Yer right yer scoundrel.
              :P~
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan>great!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Any ideas about next week's Workshop?
(2-4,Da Shad) If the IRA really wanted to get the brits out...
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Hint hint hint!
(2-4,Da Shad) they just need to blow up the shipyards in Northern
Ireland.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) I spoke to an Irishman who was probably in the IRA 
              since he denied it...
(2-4,Da Shad) Once there is no more economic value in northern ireland-
...
(2-11,Nan)    how about a workshop on stone circles etc.
(2-4,Da Shad) there owuld be no more need for the brits to keep troops
there.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) his theory was for the Brits to just pull out, I said
"bloodbath would follow", he said...
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan> Great idea!!
(2-4,StonedAgain) Just call me stonie!  (g)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) yes for 3-5 yrs then it would settle down and achieve
normalcy with the rest of Ireland
(2-11,Nan)    is this wkshp officially over? (loggin on long distance
here)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) one would guess <G>

              and made them agree to trace lineage on the Mother's
side!<G>
(2-20,O'Ba'n) I heard somewhere they were matrilineal, since they were 
              quite open sexualy
(2-20,O'Ba'n) <G>
(2-8,O'Dubh)  The women had a lot of different partners.
              and the men went both ways

(2-6,O'Dubhain ) "Celtic Workshop #5 - The Otherworld"
 
3181

Before I begin let me say a few words about how the Workshop is
conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight that is me. If
you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge you by typing
"ga" at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your question type
"ga" to let me know that I may respond. When we are finished I will
acknowledge the next questioner in a similar manner. If you have a
comment or additional information to provide on a topic, please use the
"!" to signal me.  I will also cycle through those with comments. If
their are no questions at this point I will begin tonight's  presen-
tation.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) I would also like to apologize for not producing
the list of tree correspondences this week that I promised to provide.
Being on the road and away from home, I was not able to get to all my
references about trees, herbs and the like. I haven't forgotten the
promise however. I will post the list as soon as I return to Virginia
this weekend. This list can be used together with certain meditation
practices to determine the "soul tones" of the Tree Oghams. I did locate
the Ogham/musical tone table of correspondences that I had mentioned in
the Celtic Workshop #4. This table is by the Celtic scholar Dr. Sean
O'Boyle:
 
                For the Treble Cleff (in descending order of tone):

                In addition to the above correspondences, The following
properties of our beings were associated with tone combinations:
 
                        The Body - Single tones
 
                        The Mind - Two tone intervals
 
                        The Spirit - Three tones at the same time
(chords)
 
                For more information on this subject, I recommend
reading "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Adams (Llewellyn) or the
Original work by O'Boyle: "Ogham: The Poet's Secret" (1980, Gilbert &
Dalton Ltd., Dublin).
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The beliefs of the Celts and their Magickal/Religious
practices cannot be fully understood without becoming more familiar with
their Cosmologies and Deities. In considering how to proceed with the
Workshop, a variety of topics came to mind:
 
                        The Otherworld
                        The Gods and Goddesses
                        The Objects of Power
                        The Guardians of the Circle
                        The "Place Names" 
                        The "Totem Animals"
                        The Transmigration of the Soul
                        The "In Between Times and Places"
                        The "Need Fires" or Days of Imbalance.
                        The Portals, Dolmens, Stone Circles, Passage Graves
                        The Rite of Three Rays
                        The use of Herbs and Potions
3183

                        The Gift of Awen
                        The Act of "Becomming"
                        The Charm of "Summoning"
                        "Walking between the Worlds"
                        "Journeys on the Wheel"
                        The "Outer Darkness"
                        The "Dragon's Eye"
                        The "Many Speckled Rainment"
                        The Charm of "Making"
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Subject of tonight's Celtic Workshop is The Celtic
Otherworld.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
        
                        The Otherworld
                        The Gods and Goddesses
                        The Objects of Power
                        The Guardians of the Circle
 
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Celtic Cosmology"
 
The number three was sacred to the Celts and the Druids.  It should come
as no surprise that the Celtic Cosmos is threefold: The Sky World, The
Earth World and the Underworld. Each of these realms is associated with
particular deities and Magickal acts or techniques.  
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Sky World was associated with the heavenly bodies:
the Sun, the Moon, the stars. This is the realm of the Gods and
Goddesses and is associated with the cycles and patterns of the Sky (and
perhaps also associated with The Megalithic Stone Circles).  These
visible objects were used as a basis for performing Higher Magicks such
as: Prophecy and Astral travel. The cycles of the Sun and Moon also were
used to determine the appropriate times for doing particular types of
Magick. Festivals were held during Full Moons, Dark Moons, the 6th nite
of the New Moon, Sunrise, Sunset and the 4 days of the Solar extremes;
Mid Winter, Mid Summer and the Equinoxes. The heavenly bodies were not
themselves considered to be Deities, but were thought to reflect or
contain the types of Power associated with particular entities. The
Fires of the Sun were associated with the forge and with inspiration,
possibly making Brigid (An aspect of the Irish Celtic Triple Goddess)
also a Sun Goddess. Bel or Belenus was usually associated with the
powers of the Sun as well. 
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Underworld is the realm of the Ancestors, as well
as former humans and a number of Gods and Goddesses associated with the
mystery of life springing forth from death. This process could be as
simple and mysterious as the life cycle of a seed. From old life, new
life appears in a series of changes from planting and germination to
growth and harvesting. The passage graves and burial customs of the
Celts also reflect this expectation of rebirth and afterlife. Many tombs
and burial sites show that Celts were buried with objects that they
could take with them into the Underworld to be used in battle, in
hunting and/or for nourishment. This practice appears to be similar to
what was practiced by many ancient peoples, including the Egyptians.
Celts did not fear death, they expected to live on and eventually be
reborn in another life. The Underworld and the Sky world were linked in
3184

this Mystery, sharing many of the same Gods and Goddesses. The daily
rebirth of the Sun and the phases of the Moon are a good instance of
this link between the World above and the one below.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Earth World, occupied by we the living, also
contains reflections and influences of the Sky World and the Underworld.
These influences can be pictured as three zones (remember three is a
sacred number): the upper zone is associated with the weather, the
flight of birds, sky augeries and the elements and powers of Air, the
middle zone is further divided into the Four Directions or Quarters
(each with it's own Powers/Guardians of the Sacred Land), and the lower
zone containing the depths of the sea, caves, cairns, burial mounds,
"hollow hills" and sacred springs. This zone is the home of the Sidhe
and the spirits associated with the Portals to the Underworld itself.
The Celts in their life upon the Sacred Land expected to experience the
influences of the Sky and Underworld in their life upon the Land. This
attitude is demonstrated in the many dindsenchahs (stories of place
names) that are told in Ireland to this day. Many of these stories are
associated with a deity, an elemental, an Underworld portal or a combat
of the God/desses and/or Epic heroes and heroines.

(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The following is a listing of the major Irish Gods and 
                Goddesses:
                        Danu, Dagdha, Nuada, Lugh, Angus Og, Len,

(2-6,O'Dubhain ) These two groups seem to relate to one another but
sometimes the correspondences can get very confusing. I include the
deities that most closely resonate with my own Inner Being when working
with the Sky World and the Underworld. My pantheon of Gods and Goddesses
is both Welsh and Irish (as am I <G>). I include a more detailed
description of them here:
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Danu
                        The Red Mother of All,
                        Major Mother Goddess of Ireland,
                        Mother of the Gods and Patroness of
                        wizards, rivers, water, wells, prosperity
                        and plenty, Magick and wisdom.
3185
 
                Dagdha
                        The All Father,
                        Eochaid Ollathair ( Father of All),
                        Ruadh Rofessa (The Red One, Lord of
                        Occult Knowledge),
                        Dagdha (the Good God)
                        Many talented and powerful,
                        Master of the harp and possessor
                        of a dread double ended club.
                        The Chief of the Tuatha de Dannan.
 
                The Goddess of Sovereignty (Banbha, Fodla, Eriu)
                        The Land and the King were wed through
                        many ceremonies. Essentually the fate of the
                        King and the fate of the land were One and
                        vice versa. The Favor of the Goddess could
                        be granted by some heroic act or bu being
                        Magickally chosen (The Lia Fail could do
                        this, more later). Women who held the 
                        Sovereignty of the land were often referred
                        to as the Goddess (Such as Medb, Boudicca
                        and Macha-Red Mane).
                Nuada
                        The King and battle leader 
                        of the Tuatha de Dannan,
                        Possessor of the Magick Sword of Findias,
                        Lost his sword hand in the First Battle of
                        Moytura, against the Fir Bolgs,
                        stepped down from the Kingship
                        (because the King could nave no blemish)
                        even though he was outfitted with a 
                        Magickal hand of silver. He eventually
                        had his hand Magickally restored to lead
                        the Tuatha de Dannans  against the Fomors
                        in the second Battle of Moy Tura. In this
                        battle he was physically killed so he 
                        returned the Lands of the Sidhe.
                Brigid
                        Breo saighead (Fiery Arrow or Power)
                        Often called the Triple Brigid or the
                        Triple Mother. Also Associated with
                        Danu at times. The daughter of the Dagdha.
                        Goddess of the Sacred Flame of Kildare.
                        Goddess of poets, feminine crafts, the
                        hearth, martial arts, healing and
                        inspiration. The White Maiden aspect of 
                        the Triple Goddess. Her Feast is the
                        Major Celtic Festival of Imbolc. She 
                        who gives hope and new beginnings. The
                        Celtic Church could not replace her, so
                        they absorbed her as the "foster-mother"
                        of Christ and as St. Brigit, the daughter
                        of the Druid Dougal the Brown. Brigid is
                        very like the Greek Goddess Athena.
                Lugh
                        Sam ildanach (many skilled). This is the
                        Celtic Mercury. The grandson of Balor 
                        (leader of the Fomorians and the son of
3186

                        Cian and Ethniu, a Sidhe princess. His 
                        feast is Lughnasadh, a celebration of
                        the death of his "foster mother", Tailtiu.
                        He is the combination of the Tuatha de
                        Dannans and the Fomors. He replaces Nuada
                        as the King and battle leader of the Tuatha
                        de Dannan and leads them to ultimate victory
                        in the second Battle of Moytura. He is 
                        sometimes called the "Shining One" and/or
                        Lugh Lamhfada (of the "long arm"). 
                        He also has attributes of a carpenter, mason,
                        poet,Druid, physician and a goldsmith. He
                        can be considered the Irish God of just about
                        everything. He was also the father of the
                        great Irish hero, Cuchulain.

                        antics, he was an extremely powerful God 
                        and was usually associated with fertility,
                        rebirth, weather, sailing and Magick. He also
                        had a Magickal ship that moved without sails

3187

                        Gwion had tasted of her cauldron, she chased him
                        through a variety of mutaual shape changes until
                        at last she caught and consummed him as a grain
                        of wheat. This caused her to give birth to
                                                                           Taliesin.

                 land ofIreland. Taliesin was the great Bard of        
                the Welsh, whose poetry and songs, Including the

                the Cauldron of Cerridwen. They are both patrons

2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Objects of Power"
 
The Tuatha de Dannans are the Children of the Mother Goddess Danu. They
are the Gods and Goddesses of Ireland. Some say they come from the sky,
others say the North. They were masters of Occult knowledge learned in
the four great Magickal cities of Findias, Gorias, Murias and Falias.
They were given a great treasure by the Chief Mages of each city
(Uiscias from Findias, Esras from Gorias, Semias from Murias and
Morfessa from Falias). These gifts are the four treasures of Ireland:
The Sword of Nuada, the Spear of Lugh, the Cauldron of Rebirth and the
Stone of Fal. We can use the Power of such gifts in our own Magick by
invoking the four Masters of the North.  Once invoked, the Power of 
3188

their gifts can once again be manifested in our very own Magickal
Talismans.
 
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Sword Of Nuada Argetla'm"
 
The first object of Power comes from Findias. It is the invincible sword
of Nuada "of the silver hand".  It represents the forces of insight and
illumination.  It is a representation of the terrible Powers of creative
energy. The drawing of such a sword is what gives us new and terrible
abilities (Atomic Power is an example of what such inspiration can
create). The wisdom to not use or to maintain control such powers is
what the use of this Sword is all about. Many times the wisest course of
action is to keep the Sword sheathed and to resolve our conflicts
peacefully.

Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in a modern day
ritual:
               <I walk to the altar and pick up the Sword.  Advancing to the
East, I raise the Sword and say:>  "Here is the Sword of Nuada Argetla'm
in its deady scabbard.
                        Heed the Magicks of Findias! 
                        Uiscias wrought this blade! 
                        He of the Silver Hand lives again!
                        Who will dare to grasp it and define 
                        the boundaries of our safety?"
        
               <After the sword has been accepted by a member of the Circle,
               the following is said while walking three times (deosil)
               around the perimeter of the Circle :>
 
                        "Come forth Old One of the East!!!"
        
          <After the completion of the three circles, I light the Red
Candle of Life that sits upon the Eastern Quarter and say:>
 
                        "Guard us well so that our lives may be our own.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        (So Mote It Be!)"
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha"
 
The second object of Power comes from Findias. It is the iresistible
Spear of Lugh "of the Long Arm".  This gift represents the ability to
act across a distance.  It is represented by the Powers of fire that can
also act across a distance, leaping between burning buildings yet also
warming us from within the hearth fires. This flaming spear always finds
its target once thrown. It is no surprise that Lugh must defeat Balor
"of the Evil Eye" allowing the Tuatha de Dannans to conquer the Fomor.
Today the ability to act across a distance might be better characterised
by the telephone/communications networks.  The free exchange of
information has fanned the flames of creativity in the modern world.
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in
the same modern day ritual as before:
                 
                        <I walk to the altar and pick up the Spear.
Advancing to the South, I raise the Spear and say:>
3189
 
               "In my Right hand I hold the Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha.
          Brought from Gorias and given by Esras.
          It contains the Wisdom of Many acting across the Ways.
          No batle can be sustained against us while we possess it.
          Who will wield this Power?"
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) <After the spear has been accepted by a member of the
Circle, the following is said while walking three times (deosil) around
the perimeter of the Circle :>
 
                        "Come forth Old One of the South!!!"
        
<After the completion of the three circles, I light the White Candle of
Inspiration that is in the South and say:>
 
                        "Guard us well so that our ideas may burn
                        as does Thy eternal flame.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        (So Mote It Be!)"
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Cauldron of Rebirth"
 
The third object of Power comes from Murias. It is the "Cauldron of
Rebirth". This gift has the  Power to regenerate life and is usually
associated with the Dagdha or Bran the Blessed. It can also be linked
with portals to the Otherworld through which all life  passes during the
death/life cycle. Mannanan mac Llyr who rules the sea and who is the
possessor of the "Crane Bag" (another symbol for the Cauldron) is
another deity associated with this Magickal device. The Welsh Goddess
Cerridwen is also a keeper of the Sacred Cauldron.The Spring of Life and
wisdom flows forth from the depths of the sea (another use for this
cauldron).
  
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
our modern day rituals:
 
                        <I walk to the altar and pick up the Cauldron. 
I place it upon the West Quarter and say:>
 
                        "This is the Cauldron of Rebirth, 
                        by it's waters we are reborn.
                        Fashioned in the fires of Murias,
                        Forged by the will of Samias.
                        Life eternal is its gift.
                        We pass through Death with each use.
                        May the waters of rebirth ever flow forth!
                        Who will call us back 
                        from the deepest meditation?
                        Who will summon us from the Shadows
                        of the Sea?"
 
                        <The Cauldron has sea salted water poured into
it by a member of the Circle, This water is sprinkled three times
(deosil) around the perimeter of the Circle while the following is
said:>
 
                        "Make thy Presence known Old One of the West!"
        
3190

<After the completion of the three circles, I light the Gray Candle of
Twilight that stands in the West and say:>
 
                        "Keep our Spirits safe within Your soft embrace.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        So Mote It Be!"
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Lia Fail"
This is the Kingship stone of Ireland. It was brought from the Northern
city of Fal by the Tuatha de Dannan. This stone represents the Land and
it's Sovereignty. It also represents the Power of the Earth to Judge all
men. The other portals to the Underworld (caves and raths) are represen-
ted by this Magickal object.  The dark reaches of the Underworld hide
the secret knowledge of Death and Life. It is into the earth that Celts
are buried to begin their journeys after death. Small wonder it is that
the Goddess guarding this object should be the dread Morrighan. She
represents the Wisdom that is gained via the Dark Pathways, yet she is
also the bringer of victory in battle as well as new life, where none
was expected. She represents the stark reality of Life and Death.
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
our modern day rituals:
 
<I walk to the altar and pick up the Stone.  I place it in front of the
North Quarter candle and say:>
 
     "This is the Lia Fail, let all here be sobered by its True  Judgement. This is the Stone of Judgement, Solemn sacred One of Falias,
grant our space your Sovereignty.  Morfesa has worked the   Earth's
Power within you.  Judge of Kings, Center of Earth, Speak   and we shall
listen!  Do not let us fail to heed your warnings!"
        
<I turn to face the members of the Circle and ask:>
        
                        "Who will Stand with the Stone of Destiny?"
 
<The One that has accepted the challenge, steps upon the stone and crys
forth:>
        
                        "Manifest your Power Old One of the North!"
                        "Open Your Dark Pathways
                        Give us True Judgement!
                        Bring forth Thy Hidden Knowledge!"
 
<I step back to the altar and face to the North.  I light the Black
Candle of Darkness and say to all those who are gathered:>
 
                        "May our souls know the Truth of Eternity.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        So Mote it Be!"
        
<Starting at the East with arms open, I turn deosil around the Circle,
stopping when I have come back to the East and say:>
 
     "My Brothers and Sisters in the One Power, Hear my Words!  Our
Circle is complete!  We have Perfectly Created a Sacred Space, a Place
out of Time. Let none seek to enter who would violate our Purpose. Our
will shall be done and none shall be harmed! May the Guardians of the
3191

Four Quarters keep Their Watch over this Circle and lend us Their Mighty
Aid!"
 
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )  That pretty much sums up the prepared presentation, any
questions?


(2-5,Nan)        Whew!
(2-5,Nan)        I'm still absorbing
(2-2,Freepowder) bet your fingers are cramped <G>
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) yep!  Well there is a lot more I could say!<G>
(2-2,Freepowder) ok!
(2-2,Freepowder) <hehehehe>
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Like We could talk about just where those cities were?
                 The Sky or the North?
                 UFO's maybe?
(2-2,Freepowder) ok, first tho, was the stone of fal...
(2-2,Freepowder) the same as the stone of scone?
(2-2,Freepowder) ga
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) That was what the Scots and the Sassanach would have us
believe.
(2-2,Freepowder) you say?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) But the Irish tradition is that it is still inside of
Tara.
(2-2,Freepowder) thought so. hrumph.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Why would we every give away one of the treasures of
the Land?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Besides!<G>
(2-2,Freepowder) stolen?
(2-5,Nan)        what's the stone of scone? (other than a very old tea
snack <g>)
(2-2,Freepowder) LOL
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) If it really was stolen then it sits in Westminister
Abbey!  And hasn't cried out in over 400 years!<G>
(2-2,Freepowder) nahm, it's still in Tara, yup!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Meaning.....that the Sassanach are not the rightful
kings of Ireland!!!!<GGGG>
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The stone of Scone was the kingship stone of the Scots
(2-5,Nan)        ahh, now i remember
(2-2,Freepowder) N> Scotland had a similar legend to that of the stone 
                 of Fal, it was taken to westminister abbey when the 
                 english took scotland
(2-2,Freepowder) And they niver give it back!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp>That's right....thieving Sassanch!<G>
(2-2,Freepowder) rude!
(2-5,Nan) lol
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) <======Just finished "Trinity" and in a very 
                 unforgiving mood.
(2-2,Freepowder) the 4 cities, which world were they in?
(2-2,Freepowder) LOL!
(2-2,Freepowder) grand book! read it a few years ago.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes it sure makes one think that they'll never resolve 
                the Problem of Northern Ireland.
(2-2,Freepowder) I met a fellow, prob IRA, said...
(2-2,Freepowder) the brits need to just pull out...
(2-2,Freepowder) I said ther'd be a blood bath....
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp>The Four Cities were in the North but in the    3201

of the Dead, Arawn. Cuchulain the Champion of Ulster gets his name from
replacing the Hound of Cuchul that he kills. He is called the "Hound
of Ulster" from this event. The hound is also his totem animal.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   <a slight pause>

There are many other Magickal totemic animals in Celtic Magick and
history: the Eagle (Iolair), Crow (Badb), Raven (Bran), Sow (Airc), Boar
(Bacrie), Cat (Caoit), Otter (Balgair), Bear (Arth), Badger (Breach) and
the Eel (As-chu).
 
The Dragon is another mighty Magical animal that appears in British and
Welsh stories. It is, of course, a creature of fire but is also related
to the Power of the Land. Another word for Ley Lines is Dragon Lines.
Another name for raising Power is to invoke the "Eye of the Dragon". The
whole Earth was viewed by the Druids as the body of the Dragon. Menhirs
and stone Circles were located at great Power nodes. The Celts called
Dragons "Fire Drakes".
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The importance of these animals is in their use as
Spirit Guides in the Otherworld and their aid as a familiar in working
Magick. To find your totemic animal will require you to experience a
shamanistivc trance. This is usually accomplished by "drumming" and
meditation. (You'll need someone to drum or a "drumming tape" to allow
yourself a chance to really meditate). Open youself up to the God of the
Hunt as you meditate upon the Tree of Life. He will come to you while
you are in trance (usually after 10 to 40 minutes of drumming). Your
totem animal will apear running from the Great Forest. When the animal
appears, let its essence fill you. Become your totem. Dance its dance
and sing its song until you are one in the Spirit. You should repeat
this ritual as often as necessary to have a close rapport with your
Spirit Animal guide.  Much of what you are told and given will be from
the perspective of the Animal and will be difficult to understand unless
you are truly One with it.  

(2-4,Nan)       does one usually only have a single totem animal or is 
it possible to have more than one? ga
(2-21,O'Dubh)   It's possible to have more than one.  You might have a
clan totem as well as a personal totem animal.

(2-21,O'Dubh)   Ok I have one more topic to cover  "The Transmigration
of the Soul"
 
I would like to start this discussion by quoting an ancient Celtic
Culdean verse:
 
                              "Out of a Timeless World
                              Shadows fall upon time.
                              From a beauty older than earth
                              A ladder the soul may climb.
                              I climb by Fionn's Stair
                              To a whiteness older than time."
                
The above verse is referring to Aradach Fionn, a listing of the Oghams.
Each rung of the ladder or stair represents a lesson learned or a new
life of continuing perfection. Such a series of lessons and rebirths are
a manifestation of the Druidic concept of the Tramsmigration of the
Soul.
3202                            
               A few quotes about Druids:
 
"The principal point of their teaching is that the soul does not perish,
and that after death it passes from one body into another." .....Julius
Caesar.
 
"Among them the doctrine of Pythagoras prevails, according to which the
souls of men are immortal, and after a fixed term recommence to live,
taking upon themselves a new body."....Diodorus
 
According to some sources, this transmigration of the soul was done in
an upward fashion, with each incarnation bringing the Being closer to
the True Spirit. According to others, we are reincarnated into future
lives of our progeny...thus Mongan is The Spirit of Fionn reincarnated
in the Seventh Century CE (Fionn himself was said to be Cumhail reincar-
nated). As we have seen previously, the Spirit of Tuan mac Carill is
reincarnated several times as a variety of animals until he is reborn
in the sixth century and relates his history of Ireland from the time of
Partholan forward, St. Finnen is the Irish monk to whom the story was
related. This story was eventually recorded in the Eleventh century
manuscript, "The Book of the Dun Cow". No record exists to indicate that
the Druids believed in "karma", duality (as seen in the concept of "good
and evil"), original sin (actually they believed man was inheritly
good), nor a heaven and hell afterlife.
 
Where did one's soul reside then ? Many stories were told and written of
the Otherworlds that awaited the Spirit between incarnations, These 
stories are called immrama or "wonder voyages" and usually involve
taking ship to a Magickal Isle. The voyages of Bran and St. Brendan 
generally fit into these catagories.
                
When one arrives at an Otherworldly island, time can pass extremely
slowly compared to the Physical world. Oisin the son of Fionn went to
such a faery world for a few days only. When he returned for a visit
upon one of those Magickal White Horses, he discovered that many
hundreds of years had passsed.  Although he had been cautioned not to
dismount during his visit, he did so and was immediately transformed
into an extremely elderly man. St. Patrick was brought to him and heard
his many stories of the exploits of Fionn and the Fianna as well as the 
lands of Tir na Og. Oisin was eventualy rescued by his Sidhe princess
and returned to the Land of Eternal Youth. Some of the other Lands are
called:
 
                              Tir fo Thuinn - Land under the Wave.
                              Tir na mBan   - Land of Women.
                              Tir na mBeo   - Land of Life.
 
These four Tirs or lands make up the Celtic Underworld where Souls
reside until reborn. There are also Plains above that are generally the
habitations of the Gods.
               Thes are:
                              Sen Magh      - Old Plain
                              Magh Argetal  - Plain of Silver Clouds
                              Magh Mell     - Plain of Delight
                    Magh Ionganaidh - Plain of Wonder




3203

The Irish Celts felt that the Being had the following attributes or
divisions:

                              Delph         - The appearance or Outer form
                              Duile         - The Body Elements 
                                                                           (flesh, bone, blood, etc)
                              Ana'l         - The breath or anima
                              Menma         - The Mind and the Will
                              Cuimhne       - The Memory
                              Fein          - The Self
                              Pu'ca         - The shape-shifting Shadow
                              Enaid         - The Soul.
 
I would like to finish my remarks on Reincarnation and Transmigration
with another ancient verse. This verse is from the Fifth Century CE and
is the translation by Kuno Meyer:
 
                              "I invoke the seven daughters of the sea
                              Who fashion the threads of the sons of 
                              long life.
                              May three deaths be taken from me!
                              May seven waves of good fortune be dealt to me!
                              May no evil spirits harm me on my circuit!
                              In flashing corslet without hindrance!
                              May my fame not perish!
                              May old age come to me, may death not come 
                              to me until I am old!"
 
                              "I invoke Senach of the seven periods of time,
                              Whom fairy women have reared on the breasts 
                              of plenty.
                              May my seven candles not be extinguished!
                              I am an indestructable stronghold.
                              I am an unshaken rock.
                              I am a precious stone.
                              I am the luck of the week.
                              May I live a hundred times a hundred years.
                              Each hundred of them apart!
                              I summon their boons to me.
                              May the grace of the Holy Spirit be upon me!"
 
That's the Celtic view of life!  To live but to have variety and
passion, while reincarnating over and over!<G>

                          Celtic Workshop #7 

   "In Between Times and Places", "Need Fires" or Days of Imbalance,
          Portals, Dolmens, Passage Graves and Stone Circles"

Tonight the Magickal nature of "In Between Times and Places" will be
discussed and examples will be given for their use in Magickal "wor-
kings". The Druidic concept of "imbalance" in Magickal workings will be
introduced and discussed. The nature and use of the stone megalithic
sites will also be presented and discussed.

Tonight we undertake a journey to the lands that are between the worlds.
This is the same place where anything can happen that Rod Serling
referred to as the "Twilight Zone". The ancient Celts sought out this
3204

Magickal place to aid their Magickal Power and to seek the Otherworld.
Before we can undertake this journey of the Spirit as well as the Mind,
a brief review and synopsis of our previous discussions on the Celtic
Otherworld and Magick are in order. 

                     "In Between Times and Places"

As we noted previously, the Celts believed that Reality actually
consisted of multiple worlds.  As a minimum, they believed there was a
World of the Stars or Gods, a Middle World (the Earth) and an Under-
world. All these worlds were connected in some way, with events and
Magicks from one affecting events occuring in a different world.
The Celts believed that these Worlds were closer at certain times. These
are the "In Between Times" that we are going to speak about tonight. It
should also be no surprise that the Celts and Druids practiced their
most important Magicks during such times of transition as the sunrise,
sunset,the moonrise, moonset and the transitions of the seasons
(Beltaine and Samhain) and the extremes of the Sun (Mid-Winter and
Mid-Summer) or the great "Fire Festivals". Later during our discussions
of stone circles and passage graves we shall see one way that this
desire to do Magick at the optimal times was possibly implemented.

                 "The Magickal Laws of Druidic Power"

Celtic tales of Magick are filled with events that are linked to "in
between states". This could be a mysterious fog, a time of dusk or next
to the edge of water. All of these conditions have one state in common,
they represent imbalance. Any student of the physical sciences can tell
you, that all forces can  be resolved into the sum total of the in-
dividual forces. One of the factors that must be overcome when moving
anything is inertia. During times of change, when imbalance occurs
naturally, is the time chosen by Druids for their Magicks. This is and
example of the Law of Magickal Association, the Law of Similarity and
the Law of Contagion as stated by Issac Bonewits in his book "Real
Magick". Here is a listing of those three laws of Magick:

         Law of Association.

If two things have anything in common that thing can be used to control
both, and they have a mutual influence on each other, depending on the
size of the thing shared. The more they have in common, the more they
influence each other.

         Law of Similarity.

This is the basis of "Sympathetic" magic and basically says that effects
resembles causes.  "Lookalikes are alike".

         Law of Contagion.

It states that once things come into contact, they continue to interact
after separation.  "Power is contagious".

These three Laws of Magick basically say that if you want to do Magick
pick a time when Magick occurs that is similar to the kind of Magick
that you want to accomplish. There is a very similar belief held by
modern Wiccans.  Wiccans normally do creative or "positive" magick when
the Moon is in its waxing phases. Banishing or "dark" Magick is done
3205

during the waning phases of the Moon. Druidic Magick took advantage of
the times when the Sun or Moon "touched" the Earth (Sun/Moon rise/set).
At such a time, some of the Power inherit to these heavenly deities
could be "borrowed". This is the Law of Contagion at work. At Sunrise
and Sunset is when the mists "Magickally" appear, making fog or mists a
time of Magickal workings. The area of transition between states of
matter such as the edge of a river or lake was also thought to be a
Magickal location. This could have been due to the belief that all
knowledge flowed forth from  the Well of Segais or Conla's Well but I
believe it is more closely associated with the belief that where
different worlds met was also a place where entry to the Otherworld was
the easiest.  This also explains why they favored divination by the edge
of water. Fire scrying is another example of this "Magick" in transition
states. Fire is the ultimate transitory state of matter and leads us to
the next  topic of discussion, "Need Fires" and "Days of Imbalance".

                          "Days of Imbalance"

As you will recall, another time of greatest imbalance was when the
change of the seasons and the extremes of the Sun. This is, of course,
Beltaine, Samhain, Mid-Winter's and Mid-Summer's Solstices. Great fires
were kindled during these festivals for two reasons: To encourage and
enhance the energies of the Sun and to create conditions favorable to
Tramsmutation of Power.

These "need fires" were used to scry, to purify and to sacrifice as
well. Animals and other offerings were cast into the flames. As we have
seen in a previous Workshop, cattle were driven between the fires and
youths engaged in jumping through the flames. (It has been conjectured
that this practice of flame jumping had its origins in earlier practices
of human sacrifice.   I personally have not seen a single valid
reference to Druidic human sacrifices.)  The thought was also held that
"like attracts like", so that the Power of the flames would also attract
the Magickal Power of the Sun.

Being periods of imbalance, the Druids also took advantage of the flows
of power to perform divinations.  These great fires also served to
signal the Power of the Druids to all people, as well as to unify their
control over the minds of the Celtic nations.

                 "The Otherworld, Portals and Domans"

Although the Celts did not build the megalithic structures found within
their lands, they were certainly aware of them. Without exception these
monuments were attributed to the God/dessess, heroes and/or to the
Tuatha de Dannan. The many dolmens were thought to be passage ways or
portals to the Otherworld.  Many myths and tales surround trips made to
and from the realm of the Sidhe by passing through a dolmen archway when
the Moon was full. Modern archeology has determined that these dolmens
are actually neolithic burial sites.

            "Bru'gh na Bo'inne (Newgrange)"

One of the oldest structures in the Western world is found in Ireland
upon the banks of the Boyne river. This is the Bru'gh na Bo'inne, the
burial place of Irish kings and the legendary palce of the Dagdha and
Angus mac Og. The area is also known, in English, as New Grange. This
structure was erected by the original inhabitants of the land around 
3206

3500 BC, predating Stonehenge and being contemporary with the Sphinx and
the Pyramids of Egypt. The structure was covered with white stones in
ancient times and would "shine' in the Sun when seen from great
distances. This is very similar to the way the Great Pyramid was also
described when seen in the sunlight with it's reflective coating.

Many ancient Irish legends and tales are associated with this structure
and the passage of time. Most of these tales are about time standing
still or seeming to pass without notice. Their stories center around
Angus mac Og (the Young God), his birth in a day, his attaining the
ownership of the Bruig for "only a day and a night" (lasting forever in
endless cycles), and his arrangement of his foster father Midir's
marriage to Etain (who is the subject of many stories of shapeshifting
and transformation). 


                    "Spirals, Symbols and Carvings"

This theme of timeless days and transformation is very important when
one considers that one possible use of this structure was the taking of
shamanistic journeys. (Angus himself was visited by an aisling or "dream
woman" who played for him upon a timpan and eventually they are
transformed into white birds of enchantment).

Martin Brennan, an Irish-American, was the first person to note the
relationship between the carvings at New Grange and the rays of the Sun.
Using the discoveries of Brennan and our previous information about
Celtic Shamanism, I am going to suggest that the interior chambers of
this structure were used for shamanistic ceremonies and journeys.

Let me describe the geometry of Bru'gh na Bo'inne that a Draoi' priest
might have encountered when appraoching the structure for religious/Mag-
ickal ceremonies. The first thing that would be noticed is a brillant
white bowl or hemisphere shining amidst a sea of green. This mound is
surrounded by 97 kerbstones and the entire structure is then encircled
by a ring of standing stones.  At the entrance is a stone that one walks
around to enter the inner chambers. This stone is covered with spirals
that have been carved into the stone. The stone is divided by a line
that is aligned with the Mid-Winter Sunrise, the right hand spirals
being counter clockwise (tuathal or widdershins) and the left hand
spirals going clockwise (deosil). This is exactly the same type of path
through the sky that one would observe for the sun during the year. (In
fact, if you take a lens and focus the Sun's light on a board and leave
it in place for a year, a track will burned upon the board in the shape
of an interconnected double spiral. This experiment was done in the
early 1970's by American artist Charles Ross.)  The entrace to the
interior chambers, beyond the entrance stone, is 70 meters in length.
One must pass beneath three large stones that are thought to be symbolic
of the Celtic Cosmology, the Sky World, the Middle World and the
Underworld. Once past this Otherworldly entrance, one encounters a large
chamber with four smaller side chambers that are oriented to the four
cardinal directions (North, South, East and West). The inner walls are
covered with spirals and symbols, among them is an eight-rayed sun
symbol (depicted within a circle). This symbol as well as the rest are
selectively illuminated by the Sun's entrance through a small hole in
the roof box that is oriented directly to the Mid-Winter sunrise. A
finger of light would shine within the chamber to illuminate the
carvings, shining in golden flecks upon the chamber walls. Within the
3207

main chamber were great stone bowls that were possibly filed with water
and arranged to further enhance the solar display within by acting as
mirrors. The seemingly hap-hazard arrangement of carvings upon the walls
are organized and transformed by the rays of the Sun.

             "A Night with Angus mac Og"

Now that the stage is set, imagine yourself to be a seer of the fourth
millenia BC. You have fasted for days and have spent the long dark night
of Mid-Winter meditating within the inner chambers of Angus mac Og.  You
have performed your rituals you have attained a trance-like state and
you await the rising of the Sun, the new God of Light to return to the
world. What far journeys or estatic visions will be triggered within
your Sacred Space by the new Sun's first rays?  A sudden thin ray of
white light pierces the blackness of the inner chamber with an il-
luminating shower of images as the inner darkness explodes! Your mind
reflects the brilliance of the new born Sun as your inner consciousness
expands into infinity! Your brothers and sisters would follow the dark
shadow the standing stone to the carn's entrance to find you and the
inner chamber reborn within the rebirth of the Mid-Winter Sunrise! What
stories you could tell! What prophecies you could make! I sometimes
think that Bru'gh na Bo'inne is really the Hyperborean " ...temple of
the Sun..." mentioned by the ancient Greek writers, rather than
Stonehenge. 

                    "The Land of the Hyperboreans"

Perhaps the British Isles are the Islands of the Hperboreans after all?
Where else is found such a system of large scale, megalithic structures
all centered around the Sun and the Otherworld? One has only to step
within any of these raths to be transported to another time or another
age. Bru'gh na Bo'inne is only one among many such locations.  Three
great mounds exist in this area of the Boyne river, New Grange is the 
most elaborate but the nearby mounds of Dowth and Knowth are also
fascinating.  Dowth is oriented to receive the rays of the setting Sun
on Mid-Winter while Knowth has two passages and is oriented to receive
the rays of the Equinoxes.  These chambered passages are not limited to
Ireland, but are found throughout the British Isles and even in
Brittany. Two noteable sites are located at Maes Howe in the Orkney
Islands and at Gavrinis in Brittany. The interaction of carvings and
site orientation is also wide spread and not limited to just the rays of
the Sun. Many sites also used the beams of the Moon to illuminate
passages and special formations. Although these sites could be called
observatories by those of a purely scientific viewpoint, that would be
in direct contradiction to the aims and worldviews of their creators. To
fully appreciate the beauty, majesty and wonder of these Magick sites,
requires us to use our entire mind. Perhaps we should now consider the
other great location that has equal claim to being the Hyperborean
Temple of the Sun?  That location is called Stonehenge.

                             "Faery Rings"

Who has nor heard of the mysterious lights that are seen within faery
rings when the Sidhe dance within the Moon ways? Such lights have also
been observed within Magickal Circles constructed by Wiccans and modern
day Ceremonial Magicians. The crop circle phenomena has also been
associated with light displays and formations. All these phenomena have
been reported and seen by reliable witnesses (although , as with all
3208

such events, there have been cases of fraud as well). The fact is that
such circlular formations have all been associated with light displays
and other unexplained phenomena.  It is no coincidence that all of the
previously mentioned Magickal phenomena are also associated with the
oldest such locations, the stone circles. Many hundreds of these sites
are found in Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The two greatest of
these are Stonehenge and Avebury. I will discuss Stonehenge tonight. I
may discuss Avebury in the future if it is of sufficient interest to the
other members of the workshop.

                             "Stonehenge"

Has there ever been a place to fire the imagination such as Stonehenge?
What secrets does it hide as it sits amid the many other marvels to be
found upon the Salisbury Plains ? This question and thousands more like
it have passed through the minds of mortals for at least the last 3000
years. Why was it built? Who built it? How was it used? Can it be used
again? I'm sure you many have a few questions of your own!<G>  Before we
get to the questions, let's go through a few of the details we know
about the site and some of the more recent discoveries that have been
made regarding its possible uses.

               "Stonehenge I"

Stonehenge was built in three phases, starting with the construction of
Stonehenge I around the year 1900 BC.  This is about a thousand years
after the Pyramids and the tombs of the Bru'ghna Bo'inne and a few
hundred years before the fall of ancient Troy and the Oddessy.  The
first phase of construction was a great circular ditch with banks being
piled upon either side.  The people building it were late Stone Age
people, Not much is known about them except that they were hunters. An
opening was left on the northeast side with four holes being left at the
entrance that may have contained wooden poles. Two other holes inside
the enclosure may have held upright stones. A third hole was dug that
still contains the "heel stone", over which the sunrise is observed. A
variety of other features are associated with this first phase of
construction. I shall refer you to "Stonehenge Decoded" by Gerald S.
Hawkins and John B. White for a more indepth discussion of these or
other Stonehenge details. The entire structure was about 320 feet in
diameter and about 6 feet high by 20 feet wide with the heel stone and
possibly two other standing stones being visible. The entire bank would
have been glaring white since most of the surrounding surface region is
composted mostly of chalk. The heel stone rises about 16 feet into the
air and is about 8 feet thick by 7 feet wide. Around the inside of the
bank was a series of 56 holes called "Aubrey" holes. These holes contain
the created remains of men and women from that period. Even in its first
phase, I'm sure you'll agree, it must have been an imposing structure.

                   "Stonehenge II"

Work upon the second phase of Stonehenge was begun about 1750 BC by
another race of people known as the "Beaker People". These people built
two concentric inner stone rings consisting of 82 bluestones on about a
70 foot diameter around the center of the mound. The entrance was
widened in the ditch bank by about 25 feet and a double row of 10
bluestones was placed in the entrance to the stone circles. This work
was done during about a hundred year period and was never finished due
to some unknown interruption. With their departure, the Stone age closes
3209

in Britain and awaits the coming of the Bronze Age.

                   "Stonehenge III"

The third and final phase in the construction of Stonehenge was
undertaken by the "Wessex People" in about the year 1650 BC. These
people were much more highly skilled than the "Beaker People" and
carried on commerce with the peoples of the Mediterranean area. So many
artifacts are found from these areas that some scientists have developed
the theory that Stonehenge was finished under the auspices of a "Master
Builder" from the Mediterranean. Since this is the only large megalithic
structure attributed to the Wessex People, they may well be correct. The
previous double ring of bluestones were removed and set aside for later
use. They were replaced by a single row of huge sarsen stones coming
from Marlborough Downs. A horseshoe shaped structure consisting of
"trilithons" was placed inside of the sarsens and aligned upon the
northeast opening and the center of the new stone ring. These "tri-
lithons" are not found in other stone circles and are further evidence
of the sophistication of the builders.  The cross pieces are held in
place using a woodworking technique called "mortise and tenon" construc-
tion. All of these stone pieces were hand-worked. The uprights are very
close together (about a foot or less). The outer circle is 97 feet 4
inches in diameter. The outer stones are about 14 feet high by 7 feet
wide by 3 1/2 feet thick. The inner horseshoe is formed by stones
ranging from about 20 to 25 feet high. A temporary structure which was
oval shaped was constructed around the sarsen horseshoe that used the
previously removed bluestones. This oval was removed and the stones were
later used to form a horseshoe of bluestones inside of the sarsen
horseshoe. A number of holes was also dug outside the sarsen circles
called the "Y" and "Z" holes. These are in a pair of roughly circular
rings around the entire structure.  One stone remains to be described
and that is called the "altar stone" though no hole has been found for
it and no use has been clearly defined. It is of a different material
from the sarsens or bluestones.  It came from a quarry 30 miles away and
is of fine grained green sandstone with mica flakes. If clean, it would
glitter in the sunlight. Stonehenge III was completed about 1600 BC and
now we are left with the Mysteries of its construction and use.

      "A Quick Word about Construction"

The construction techniques would take an entire Workshop to cover and
will not be discussed tonight.  I refer you to "Stonehenge Decoded" for
details.  An estimate was made of the effort required using the
conjectured techniques and and estimate of 1,500,000 man days was
determined to be the level of effort required to build Stonehenge. These
techniques were demonstrated using modern day men to determine how many
were actually required for each task. I believe the estimate to be
realistic and accurate. The question remains, "Why undertake such a
truly monumental effort ?"  Although the "Hows" of Stonehenge are
fascinating, I am much more mystified by the "Whys"!

       "A Quick Word about Uses"

I can classify the "Uses" into five categories:
         1. It was used as a Calender to predict the seasons, the phases
of the Moon, and the times of the Sun Festivals.
         2. It was used as a site for performing Ceremonies (everything
from sacrifices to Season fesitivals).
3210

         3. It was used as a Computer to determine Solar and Lunar
eclipses. (The use as a celestial observatory also fits in here).
         4. It was used as a place to work Magick, take shamanistic
journeys (similar to a Native American Medicine Wheel), and was used to
initiate new shamans or priests into the order.
         5. It was used for some other purpose that is subject to
conjecture and awaits the revelations of our own "illuminations".

I will attempt to provide details about the site that have been
determined by computer analysis and let each of you decide for yoursel-
ves what you think, since tonight we are very limited timewise. We may
return to these topics for additional details in the future.  

                 "The Computer Analysis"

How well did Stonehenge predict the Mid Summer/WInter sunrises and/or
moonrises? When the stone alignments were analyzed by Hawkins in 1961,
using a digital computer borrowed from Havard University. The analsis
showed a TOTAL correlation of all major Sun alignments and an almost
total correlation with alignments of the Moon as well. The accuracy of
these correlations was within 1.5 degrees. The calculations were based
upon the positions of the Sun and Moon circa 1500 BC.  When the various
phases of Stonehenge were considered, it was found that Stonehenge I had
11 key positions that pointed to ten of the twelve extremes of the Sun
and the Moon and Stonehenge III pointed 8 times to 8 of the same key
positions! Needless to say, the position and day of the key Solar/Lunar
days could be easily determined using Stonehenge as a calendar. (I will
construct and upload GIFs showing these alignments to Library 16). The
computer was also used to determine a method where the 56 "Aubrey holes"
were used to predict eclipses. (BTW 56 is also the number of years that
the moon takes to complete its entire cycle through the skies). These
facts have been used to support the arguement that the priests using
Stonehenge could have reinforced their apparant "power" over the
elements by not only predicting the "dreaded" eclipses but also to
"miraculously" cause them to disappear.  I personally couldn't say if
this speculation is valid. It seems rather cynical to me. Another very
interesting fact about the location of Stonehenge is that it is almost
EXACTLY at the right lattitude (51 degrees 17 to allow the Sun and Moon
azimuths to be separated by 90 degrees. It would seem that the site was
NOT chosen at random.  

                 "Shamanistic Flights of Imagination"

Before starting, I'd like to quote the ancient Sicilian historian,
Diodorus about Britain in 50 BC:

"The Moon as viewed from this island appears to be but a little distance
from the Earth and to have on it prominences like those of the Earth,
which are visible to the eye. The account is also given that the god
visits the island every 19 years, the period in wish the stars to the
same place in the heavens is accomplished.  ....There is also on this
island both a magnificient sacred precienct of Apollo and a notable
temple.... and the supervisors are called Boreadae, and succession to
these positions is always kept in their families."

(BTW the Moon rises farthest to the North every 18 to 19 years as seen
from the center of Stonehenge).

3211

I would like to speculate upon some of the possible Magickal aspects of
Stonehenge:

         1. The site is situated in the midst of a lot of so called
"crop circle" activity. Could the energy of these verified phenomena
also be harnessed by Stonehenge? Could an outbreak of crop circle like
marks have sparked the neolithic people to have constructed their own
more permanent circles?

         2. Is there an Earth power that is yet to be discovered by
modern science. Is this power related to "orgone" as postulated by
Wilhelm Reich from his work with "bions"?  Reich said that this energy
could be seen spiralling into the air through tubes made from organic
matter. His "accumulators" were like batteries for orgone and were made
of alternating layers of organic and inorganic substances (like the
roofs of the great chambers at Bru'gh na Bo'inne).  Guy Underwood was
also a proponent of what he caled "earth force" (also described as being
spiral in nature). Underwood used divining rods to locate pockets of
such energy within Stonehenge.

         3. Is there a "Dragon" or "Serpent" power waiting to be
harnessed within the Earth?  Many of the ancient tombs have such a mark
above their entrys. The Druids certainly believed it was so. Could
ancient kings have married the land here as suggested in Marion Zimmer
Bradley's "The Mists of Avalon"? I know the area is surrounded by the
burial mounds of many ancient kings.  Is the "Dragon Power" awaiting a
new infusion of energy from a group of dedicated Magickal practitioners.
Does the Dragon sleep?

         4. The many solar/lunar occurences at Stonehenge suggest it may
have been associated with shamanistic practices and initiations in a
manner similar to the areas of the Bru'gh na Bo'inne. Such a practice is
suggested in Douglas Monroe's "The 21 Lessons of Merlin".  Is Stonehenge
a portal to the Otherworld?

                       "Ley Lines"

One cannot discuss "earth force", "orgone" or the Earth Power nodes such
as Stonehenge without discussing ley lines. These lines are geomet-
rically located by standing at a Power node and sighting towards other
power nodes. Using such techniques, "ley hunters" have determined that
most of southwestern England is criss crossed by such lines. Are ley
lines "power conduits" between "power nodes"? To answer this question I
read "Earth Memory" and "Shamanism and the Mystery Lines" by Paul
Devereaux, the editor of the "Ley Hunter" magazine and the Director of
the "Dragon Project". Devereaux has embraced, investigated, evaluated
and rejected more theories about the "ley lines" than anyone else (as
far as I know). He acknowledges that "death roads" do exist near many of
these sites but rejects them as being solely responsible for all ley
lines. (NOTE: death roads are straight roads leading to such ancient
centers for the express purpose of burials and funerary processions.
They are well documented and universal to mankind). His own personal
theory is that the ley lines are the result of shamanistic OOBE
conducted at the so called "power nodes". The ley lines are the result
of marking in this reality the patways that the shamans take in their
altered reality from one sacred site to another. He suggests that these
"traces" of the Earth's Spiritual Pathways are the means by which we can
become re-attuned to the Earth's Power and ancient knowledge.
2312

Well there we have it, a discussion of Druid Power and Power centers. I
know from my own experience that Magickal Power is stored within my own
Solitary home Circle. How much greater can the True Power be at a site
as special as Stonehenge or Bru'gh na Bo'inne?

      Celtic Workshop #8 - The "Rite of 3 Rays" and the "Gift of Awen"

As usual, we gathered slowly, in fact I was late. After some brief
initial hellos, we got started. Freepowder was still trying to live down
an experience with Coyote (the Trickster) from early in the day!<G> I
discussed the book "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Monroe as an
example of a work produced by "Awen". I wanted to give the Workshop
members a perspective on the pluses and minuses involved with such
works. I also went over some formal and personal rituals and meditations
I do to receive "illumination". All in all, a very stimulating evening
of presentation and dialogue......Searles O'Dubhain

Tonight I would like to do things a little differently than I had
planned. Before we discuss the "Rite of 3 Rays" or the "Gift of Awen",
let's talk about one of the references that I have used and some of you
may have read, "The 21 Lessons of Merlin".  
 
As we have previously discussed, not much was written down about the
Druids by the Druids. The best we can get is the ancient writings of the
Irish Celtic Culdean Monks who may have been Druids in disguise. Our 
next best sources are oral traditions found in Celtic families, legends
and Bardic lore. Comparative analysis between the other ancient In-
do-European traditions of the Brammans, Greeks, Persians,Egyptians and
the Siberian Shamans may yield some of the hidden Druidic secrets. A lot
of the time we are making some educated guesses based upon how similar
peoples worked Magicks and conducted rituals. Sometimes we have biased
"eye-witnessed" accounts such as Caesar's or the other Roman historians.
When a gap exists in our knowledge of Druidic or Celtic practices we
must do what the ancients did......we must ask that we receive the "Gift
of Awen". I'll mention some ways that this can happen and what we can do
to aid our quests for "illumination" a little later in our discussion
tonight.
 
What does all this have to do with "the 21 Lessons of Merlin" you ask? 
..... The answer is that this is precisely the approach that Douglas
Monroe seems to have taken in his book. He fills in the gaps with
concepts that have come to him as illuminations and also uses the
illuminations of the "Bardic Mysteries" of Wales (also arrived at by the 
aforementioned methods). Since  we are all humans, some mistakes can
occur when we interpret our "illuminated" thoughts and concepts. This is
precisely why ALL SOURCES should be viewed critically and questioned
(even as our very own Freepowder is prone to do!<G>). I know I constan-
tly question and compare. Monroe's book has some very good concepts in
it and some that I dispute. My primary dispute with him is over his
concepts regarding the sexual polarities and workings of Magick. 
               
He states that Druids were segregated in their Magickal workings because
men and women cannot work together in a symbiotic manner Magickally. He
says that women receive Magick from men but do not return it when a
working is done. This is directly opposite my own experiences where I
have found the presence of women to Powerfully enhance the working of
Magicks.  He also states that male Druids did not marry and were
celibate.  That may be true in Wales, but the Irish Druids married and
3213

had many children.  Abstaining from sex would have severely depleted the
Magickal "gene pool"! The Druids were not stupid! I doubt seriously if
they abstained from sex or procreation! Sex Magick is Big Magick!  (As
I'm sure we will all agree!<G>). So Monroe does make mistakes....so do
it.<G> Time and experimentation are the two best tools to evaluate any
system and the systems of this book will be analyzed fully before we are
done in this series of Workshops.
 
Now I would like to briefly summarize what is in "The 21 Lessons of
Merlin": 
              1. The 3 Rites of Assumption
 
              This lesson refers to the manner in which a student can
first develop the ability to tap Power and to receive inspirations from
the Higher Consciousness that exist around us. Monroe uses the "Song of
Amergin", "The Song of Taliesin" and the "Song of Blue Star" to
introduce us to Druidic imagery and visualization.
 
              2. The Pelen Tan
               
              In this lesson, Monroe says that the "Pelen Tan" or a 
kind of glass globe with a candle or light inside of it was used to
create a lighted space under trees that literally caused the area to
glow with a "blue light" (used by male Druids). He also says that the
white robes of the Druids emphasized the "black light" effect of these
fire globes. He says that the female Witches of Avalon used "red lights'
when performing their ceremonies, giving rise to the association of "red
light" districts with prostitution in later ages.
 
              3. The 4 Symbols of Mastery
 
              This lesson is concerned with the development of Magickal 
symbols, arch types and correspondences. The concept of "Mastery" over
the elements is introduced and the need to be creative and original in
all occult work is emphasized.
 
 
              4. The Summoning
 
              A complete rite of Magickal evocation is described here. 
Monroe tells how to call the shades of the dead from their graves. He
introduces the use of  herbs and incense into ritual. The specific shade
being evoked in this ceremony is that of Merlin.
 
              5. The 4 Signs of Portal
 
              This lesson shows how to form a Magickal Circle, to call 
forth the Guardians of the 4 portals to the Otherworld. Symbols are
given for each Quarter (Air, Fire, Water and Earth) as well as the
symbols for the "Sign of Three Rays" that represents Spirit or Akasha
(similar to the Pentagram). The Old ones called are Uscias, Semias,
Esras and Morfessa of the Magickal cities of the North. The God in the
form of Herne is also invoked.
 
              6. The 4 Sacraments of the Earth
 
              The concepts of sacrifice to the elements upon a "Sun" day
is presented. (Not human sacrifice BTW).
3214

              7. The 8 Grove Festivals
 
              The eight major grove festivals of Samhain, Imbolc,
Beltaine, Lughnasadh as well as the Mid-Winter, Mid-Summer Solstices and
the Equinoxes are described. Some of the special items associated with
each festival are given.
 
              8. The 16 Leeches of Diancecht
 
              The use of herbs in Druidic ceremonies and practices is 
introduced. A discussion of Reincarnation is given and a Magickal
journey is undertaken using these herbs.

              9. The Rite of 3 Rays
 
              A means of achieving protection is described. The rite is 
likened to the Ceremonial Magick rite of the Banishing Rituals of the
Pentagram as practiced by the Golden Dawn.
 
              10. The Battle of the Trees
 
              The Oghams are discussed and the "Battle of the Trees" is 
described. A battle between wizards occurs and the Magick of the trees
is used to defeat Merlin's adversary, just as the tree Magick was used
to defeat invaders during the Cad Goddeu (circa 400 BC). One of the nine
draughts of inspiration is described that will allow the Druid to
commune more thoroughly with the spirits of the trees.

3215
              11. The 8 Songs of Cycle
 
              The correspondences of the Oghams to music and the use of
music in Magickal acts is presented. The use of musical instruments is
described for the various elements and a tie between the Druids and
Atlantis is suggested.
 
              12. The Herbs of Continence
 
              This lesson centers around Monroe's belief that Druids 
segregated by sexes for education, Magick and workings. He describes a
concept called "Duality". He uses a trip to the Sisterhood of Avalon
(Glastonbury) to present his case. He also advocates celibacy for male
Druids but not for the Sisters (beyond Maidenhood). Four herbal concoc-
tions are presented that enhance male sexual powers.
 
              13. The Gateway Rite
 
              A visit to Stonehenge is described. The history and lore 
of the site is mentioned with references to Atlanteans, Hyberboreans and
even the Tuatha de Dannan. A method of merging with the consciousness of
inanimate objects is also described.
 
              14. The Dragon's Eye
 
              The act of creating Druid fire is mentioned during a visit
to the Isle of Wight. The ley lines and the Power of the Land are called
Dragon Power during this lesson. A rite that allows one to "call the
Dragon" is presented and the symbol for the "Dragons Eye" is drawn.
 
              15. The Rite of Inspiration
 
              The use of meditation and Magickal Circles is described to
allow one to receive enlightenment to the Awen (the inner spirit that is
illuminated). Two rituals are given and the connection between the Sun
and Awen is given.
 
 
              16. The Wild Hunt
 
              The use of the Mandragon herb is described during a
shamanic contest between the Druid and the forces of Nature (usually
done during Samhain). The gains and losses of such a competition are
mentioned.
 
              17. The Life Board
 
              A Magickal symbol for the Three Circles of Existence 
(Ceugant, Gwyned and Abred) is given. Fionn's ladder is discussed. The
use of such an empowered Magickal Symbol for makings and pathworkings is
described.
 
              18. The Rite of Libation
 
              A  variety of Druidic draughts is given.

(2-10,Trailstalker) RE #16:  I thought that Druids were in alignment
with Nature.  What are they contesting?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    This particular lesson is about being in the Woods
3216

during the Wild Hunt of Gwynn ap Nudd when the raw primal forces of
Nature heighten one's inner fears.

(2-22,O'Dubhain)    It's a rite of Mastery whereby the young Druidic
Initiate masters himself and faces the power of Nature, the winds, the
Darkness, the lightnings and such.  So it's really a test to see how in
tune you are with Nature.

              19. The Threshold Rite
 
              The use of herbs and incense to enhance a journey to the
Otherworld is given.
 
              20. The Triscale Stones
 
              Divination using stones is presented. A pathworked trip to
the Otherworldly city of Caer Idris is made to show the origins of the
technique. The suggestion is given to find one's personal "oracle tree"
under which divinations will be optimized. 
 
              21. The Rite of the Active Door
 
              The secrets of color and the concepts of invisibility are
given along with a ritual that opens all occult knowledge to the Druid.
This Ritual is the rite of passage to the Inner Mysteries.

If you read this book, you'll see that the Druids are presented doing
Magicks that harm others at times.  Some of the Druids even do battle!
This certainly violates the Wiccan Rede that states "Do what you will if
you harm none"> The fact is that Druids were not Witches and they
frequently did battle as well as aiding their clans and kings in war.
The great Druid Amergin aided the Mileseans in their battles with the 
Tuatha de Dannan. Many other examples exist of Druids harming plenty,
least of all none. Druids were definitely not Wiccans. Monroe's book
follows this philosophy, so some may call it "unethical". He also
advocates the use of a variety of naturals drugs to aid in Magicks, 
meditations and Illuminations. I personally think these practices are a
matter of individual judgement and neither recommend nor reject them. Do
what you will. The choice is yours.
 
                       "The Rite of Three Rays"
 
     This Ritual is similar to the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the
Pentagram and the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram performed during
Ceremonial Magick and Ritual by the Golden Dawn as outlined by Donald
Craig or Israel Regardie. Monroe gives his version of this ritual in his
book "the 21 Lessons of Merlin". I haven't found any historical support
for it in my Celtic references but it seems to be typical of what I
think a Druid might do. (The Ritual smacks of Egyptian/Thelemic Magickal
practice IMHO).  Monroe likens the 3 Rays or gestures in this ritual to
the first 3 Rays of the Mid-Summer Sun over the horizon (the Celts
called this Awen as well).
 
     This ritual is primarily used to generate Power within the Druid
for protection or receiving "illumination" according to Monroe.  It uses
the vibratory energies of sound coupled with the physical act of deep
breathing and communing with the Sun to create an "altered state" within
the Druid.
3217

     Here's the basic steps of the ritual:
 
               1. Stand in direct sunlight (noon if you can do it).
 
               2. Close your eyes and breathe deeply to relax and start
the path to a meditative state.
 
               3. Once you are relaxed, exhale then breathe in deeply as
you raise your hands above your head.
 
               4. Slowly lower your arms while intoning loudly,
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" or "I" (The name of Isis in CM or Golden Dawn, this is
the invocation of the Goddess Power). Bring your arms to your sides.
     
               5. Repeat this step while intoning "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" or
"A" for Apophis the Destroyer. Monroe calls this the "Crystal Ray" or
Ray of Balance and Separation. He says this represents  both Male and
Female energies and also neither (sounds a lot like the Book of the
Law).
 
               6. Repeat again while intoning "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" or "O"
for the Male God Osiris. This invokes the God Power to your aid.
 
               7. repeat the arm gestures a final time while intoning
"IAO" or "EEEEEEE-Ahhhhhhh-OOOOOOOO!" Then open your eyes.
 
 
     At this point the energy has been raised and the work is to be
done. One could shield from Magickal attack or seek the "Gift of Awen"
or some other Magickal act.  Monroe doesn't state this but I recommend
"grounding" afterwards and if possible. Do this by eating and drinking
a lite meal. (I never recommend doing any Magick on a full stomach).
Wiccans do similar rituals using athames, wands and swords to draw
Circles and/or Pentagrams for protection and Ritual. This ritual is nice
because the 3 movements are tied to the 3 Rays of Awen.  (As with all
Magick, ritual is very personal, if it feels right do it!<G>). Monroe
says that one could reverse the direction of the arm movements and the
intonations to "banish" energies that are directed at you. He also says
that one could only do the "male", the "female" or the "crystal"
movements depending on what is needed or banished.  He suggests
experimenting as do I. I'd next like to discuss some ways that I achieve
"illuminated states".
 
(2-24,Nan)          how would you describe the basic differences/simila-
rities between Wicca and Druidry? (25 words or less <g>)
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    The Druids use the Sun and the Moon.  And the Druids
were more political back then.  Nowadays I'd say that the Druids tend to
be more left brained than the Wiccans and they tend to be more bilateral
with their Deity worship.

(2-24,Nan)          a point of clarification for me .......Wicca doesn't
use the sun?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Most of the major Wiccan celebrations are done under
the Moon. The Sun is also used but does not play as great a role as in
Druidry.

(2-6,Heather & Michel) We have both Wiccans & Druid here, so perhaps we
can clarify...
3218

(2-22,O'Dubhain)    good
(2-6,Heather & Michel) 
     Wicca uses the sun as much as Druidism. Moon is primarily for
esbats... Wiccans don't tend to be culturally specific with their
worship,  while Druids go for mostly celtic stuff and only share 4 of...
Wicca's 8 festivals.  (At least how we do it.) ... ga
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    ok!! seems to be a diversity of opinions and
practices as usual! thanks

(2-10,Trailstalker) Where would "shamanism" fit in with all of this?  We
do ceremony under the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,... in swamps, forests,
deserts, living rooms, ... you get the picture... and what's an
"esbats"?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Shamanism comes in when you seek assistance from the
Spirit world or you seek to control the elements.  Esbats are Full Moon
Wiccan Rituals held every month Sabbats are Major festivals like we
outlined previously 
(2-10,Trailstalker) I've found that with shamanism if you are seriously 
working the path, there comes a time when rather than you working it and
using medicine items, you more or less become a medicine item for a
Greater spirit power.  And it works through  you.

(2-17,Freepowder)   I remember, Druids are left brain based on Bonewits?
or others too?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Actually Druids are both sided. I think some Wiccans
tend to reject the left side approach at times Bonewits seems to be left
brain heavy!<G> IMHO!

(2-17,Freepowder)   modern druids, as previously cited?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    yes.... Modern Druids.

     The ancients were a lot more in tune with their entire minds They
didn't really draw a line as such. To receive the "Gift of Awen"
requires us to achieve heightened or altered states of consciousness.
First let's describe what an altered state is. An altered state of
consciousness is just that, a different state from that which we
normally experience. This can be anything from a heightened awareness of
our physical surrounding to a totally different way of perceiving 
all of reality. I have basically recognized the following states in
myself:
     
                  1. Sensing the mood or spirit of the land around me,
the trees, the streams, animals, the wind, the soul of the Earth. This
state is achieved by quieting the spirit and/or the mind. Being at peace
allows the world around us to communicate and touch us. I do this by
relaxing and releasing my thoughts and emotions. I float and accept. I
observe what IS. Not what I expect to see. Reality is as it is and not
filtered by my conditioning.
 
                  2. Having access to the Akasha for inspiration and
divination. (Usually coming in flashes.) I blank my mind in a manner
similar to the above process but usually do this in a secluded room
without light and external distractions. I fix my purpose in my mind and
seek for an answer. I do not allow anything to distract me. When my
answer comes, I can immediately recognize it.
  
                  3. Being out of "time sync" with others. Being
slightly in the future of what's happening around me. This usually 
3219

happens to me without trying and sometimes accompanies other heightened
states. It also happens when I've taken anything with codeine in it.
 
                  4. Seeing "visions", things that are happening in the
future or the past as if they are happening right now. This state comes
on me when I have a quest that requires me to see through a different
set of eyes or a different point of view. I actually let myself just
look into another world or time through the eyes of a native being
(sometimes me or a relative, sometimes an artificial construct.)
 
                  5. Sensing people from previous lives. I usually have
no control of this. It just happens and can be triggered by some
familiar gesture word or other similar event. I just feel very at ease
and comfortable (or hostile at times) with the person I've known before.
                  
                  6. Reading minds. (This also just happens). This is
not in words. It is in images and feelings. I just know what someone is
thinking or feeling.
                  
                  7. Going out of the body. I have to relax totally,
isolate all external distractions. I start at my extremities and work
inward. (Did I mention that I am lying down on a comfy surface?) I
release all the tension in my physical body first. I next calm my
emotions, then my thoughts.  Once I only exist within my head, I start
releasing all external inputs. I shut down all my creative centers. I
turn off all the monitoring that goes on. I relax and float. If Thoughts
or emotions enter in, I sink them into the Earth away from me. I banish
them. I float. Once I am completely isolated and floating in total
darkness, I try to see behind me and in front of me at the same time.
This is not possible while embracing the normal physical existence. It 
can only be done in our Spirit forms. This takes total concentration and
practice. Not force, just persistence and release. I liken this process
to what happens when one is born. A long persistent pushing through the 
birth canal surrounding us. The physical barriers thin out before our
efforts and suddenly we are born anew on the Astral plane.  I can then
see in all directions at the same time I am aware of all around me.
Physical barriers are only thought forms to be ignored at Will. I can go
anywhere I desire to go. (However I am only a child in this existence
and am also very aware of the far greater Powers around me). I exercise
extreme caution when traveling the Astral. It is very easy to be
"noticed" and to become the object of unwanted attentions. My conscious
mind distracts me continually as I maintain a hold on my physical
existence. When i return to me body, I actually have to struggle back
into it! Part of me wants to stay on the Astral. The barriers that
separate and protect us from Astral Intrusions are tough to penetrate
even when we hold the keys! Be careful and cautious and you can learn a
lot. Slip for a minute and you can be trapped, possessed or lost.
                  
                  8. Communing with the God/esses.
 
     I commune with the God/esses in several ways. I recognize that all
things have life and Power within them. I especially feel a closeness to
trees, plants, rivers and lakes. The ocean just overwhelms me with it's
Power. The clouds constantly change in their forms and interactions.
Celts believe that places have Spirits. I am a Celt ,by birth but also
because I feel this Oneness and connection to Nature. You can be a
Brother or Sister the same way. Birth is unimportant. Who we are in the
Spirit is very important. The first way to commune with the Spirits
3220

is through Nature. When in this state my physical senses are extremely
heightened.
                  
The next way to commune with the God/desses is through Ritual. In Ritual
we open the Pathways within us to be filled with the One Power. We
invite It within and share Its Touch. Magick is nothing more than
specialized Ritual and is a focusing of the Power. We can actually
become the God or the Goddess or some Other at these times. They can
have a physical body through us. I have sat back at such times and been
amazed at the words pouring forth from my mouth from the Energy that
possesses me. This Power is benevolent and will vanish anytime we
reassert ourselves. I caution those who would try this to be CERTAIN
that they are within a Sacred Space and are Protected before opening up
to a Spirit Entity.  All Spirits are not benevolent and some WILL try to
violate your presence and assume complete control of your body. It
happens all the time. Watch the news and see for yourself. When out of
the body and feeling no constraints, it is possible to experience the
touch of the God/desses. I have felt Their Wonderful Presences filling
me. I usually feel Their approach as a feeling of tremendous anticip-
ation. I sense that something monumental is going to occur. Something
coming to me. The space around my spirit  begins sparkling in golden 
crystals. Then I experience a thrill of Joy and Happiness. I am
completed and embraced by the Knowledge of the Ages and The Love of my
Fellow Spirit. It's beyond words but so very uplifting, comforting and 
peaceful. I feel that I am where I should be. My sense of my life's
purpose and my need to finish my work on this plane pulls me back. I
also feel that I need to share myself with those on the physical plane
I love. I cannot yet abandon the world of form. I bid Them adieu in
Perfect Love and struggle back into my body. I carry Their Blessings and
Love within. I try to share this in my life with others.
                  
                  9. Working with Power.
     
I always work within a Circle when using Power. This can be a Circle
surrounding my person in an emergency. I prefer to use traditional
methods to create Circles more formally. Circles tend to hold residuals
of the Spells of Protection that are cast for them. My Circle at home is
such a place. Anyone can enter it but only those that are invited may
work with Power there. Sleeping within this Circle is guaranteed to make
you travel and have the strangest of dreams!<G>
 
To use Power I merely open myself to it. No meditation is necessary,
though it helps me to be more sensitive to the nuances of Power. All I
really need is a Magickally isolated place, a Circle. Once I am open, I
reach for the Power of the Earth and the Sky. I let the Energy flow
through me. (It feels like it comes into my feet and out of my hands and
head! This is similar to the way lightning flows.) I leave the stream
open and charge myself as full as I can get. My hair usually stands up
a bit and I get all "goose pimply"! I keep in mind the goal of my
working and I release the Power I've stored. (At the same time the Power
leaves me, I see it going as a beam of energy. If the Working is large
or systemic, I tie the beam to the same source I've tapped. This permits
it to continue after I've released it. (I actually visualize the beam
remaining and pumping the energy out.) I leave the beam with a spell
that allows it to quit when the Work is done. I release the Power back
to the Earth and Sky and thank the God/dess for their help. It helps to
eat or drink or something equally grounded in Physical Reality after
such an effort.
3221
 
                  10. Dying.
 
This is the Ultimate altered state. I myself have never actually died in
this lifetime yet. I have been at the Portal many times. I have sensed
the Ways to Tir na Nog. Always when I am close I sense a peace and a
surrender within me to the call of the Guardian of the Door. I actually
laugh from happiness. I have been told to return to this life because my
Work is not yet done. I have spoken to members of my own family about
their near death experiences and they are remarkably similar. A
releasing and a faith in what will come. A sensing that all is right and
that the Ultimate Will Accomplishes Its Purpose. I have read many books
and accounts of the experiences of others who have gone through that
door and returned. My belief in the Afterlife is strengthened by their
revelations. The ancient Celts and Druids believed so strongly in such
an afterlife that they sometimes chose to voluntarily accompany their
loved ones through the Door. Druids would even borrow money to be repaid
in another life! Needless to say their strong beliefs in another Life
after this One caused the Celts to have no fear of Death!<G>
 
I have watched the Spirits of those I love leave their bodies and have
seen the Light that surrounds them in Happiness. I have seen their
smiles to have finished their Work and receive their New Lives. Death is
no End, Death is an Accomplishment and a Release.
 
How do we tell when these states occur? We don't have to!!!  We are in
them! They happen to us and we react to them!! We can't mistake them!!
They are beyond all Time and Space!
 
Seriously, If you are in one of these states, you feel very "charged up"
and full of energy. You sense an Exaltation of the Spirit. You are
extremely "Alive"! You will know and You will enjoy!<G>
 
How do we induce altered states of consciousness? The answer to this is
that we "open" ourselves up to them. We release our grasp on the Normal
state of Consciousness.  We expand ourselves to the limits that are
actually there and not the ones we are conditioned to accept. Seeing
things that can't exist in Normal Reality helps sometimes. It shakes us
out of our conditioning. This can be as simply as seeing a glorious
Sunset or as strange as seeing a UFO or a Demon. I have achieved altered
states through meditation, drugs, Circles, Rituals, Drumming, Singing,
Reading, Dreaming, Involuntary or accidental occurrences, sickness and
by being Possessed. I don't recommend narcotics or heavy drugs, sickness
or Possession. Incenses and herbal drinks are ok though. (We'll discuss
these next week).
              
              "Practical Meditation for Awen"
 
I'll try to elaborate a little here on the practical side of meditation.
I usually meditate lying down with my head to the North and my body
relaxed. If I am in Ritual I can Meditate while standing or kneeling.
The most important aspect to remember is to relax each part of your body
and mind. I usually start at my extremities (feet and hands). I tell
myself, "Relax your right foot, relax your left foot, relax your.... and
so on. I release all the tension in each part and let it flow out. I do
this several times until I don't feel my body any longer. Next I start
on my breathing and my heartbeat until they are automatic and transpar-
ent. Then I quiet my thoughts until only Darkness persists. Next I try
to ignore the Darkness until I am floating. To go further requires 
3222

additional techniques. At this point I am a blank tablet and can just
rest or I can receive "messages" from Others. It's very important to be
where you are absolutely secure from unwelcome intrusions of the Spirit
or the Physical at this time. Without such a safe place, you will always
be slightly on your guard. It helps if another Being you trust will
watch over you at this time. This can be anyone from an elemental, a
totemic animal, a Spirit Guide, a person to a God/dess.  Just thinking
about how it feels to meditate and then writing this answer, makes me
meditate.<G> I guess that remembering how it felt to meditate makes it
easier to meditate the next time you try! Practice makes Perfect!<G>
              
                             "Druidic Meditation"
 
Some of this material was covered previously but I repeat it here for
clarity and the benefit of those that may no have seen that particular
Workshop yet!<G> Druidic meditation was usually done for divination and
foretelling the future. This was called by the names: Tenm Laida,
Dichetal Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.
              
Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state usually achieved
by chanting or singing of a repetitive pattern. This can also include
drumming and dancing. These activities synchronize the body and mind to
an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains of normal
existence. This allows you to float at peace within the song (dance,
beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic or Shamanistic practice
even though it may look like TM.
                  
Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) is a state
achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind in a Ritual environment. It
usually involved using some Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword
or a staff to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or by handling an
item to discover what secret knowledge was contained within it. This
information could be events from a person's past life, a detailed
history of who and what had happened to an object or how and why the
subject was being hexed or spelled. I know this sounds like ESP but it
was enhanced through Ritual and relaxation techniques.
              
Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state used by seers
and bards to create or see visions. The Druid would be totally isolated
from all sensory inputs, sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually
a very dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt to
float and relax. When in the proper state he would signal for the hides
to be removed or he would open the door out of the Darkness. The sudden,
instantaneous transition from Darkness to Light would cause them to see
visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or achieve a total
Awareness of the secret Knowledge of their Surroundings. This sensory
deprivation It was their Ultimate Meditation technique.
              
The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter their
consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean Mysteries and may
have actually been the source of them!<G>
              
Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but I don't
have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.
          
                                     "Drugs"
              
I have experienced Magickal states from drugs but I don't think the 
3223

technique is sufficiently controllable or repeatable. It's like playing
your Steinway with a sledgehammer. Sure you can play a song but at what 
cost to the instrument? Plus I find that the songs are usually more
sophisticated if I don't use the sledge!<G>
              
I would caution anyone using drugs to know their track records, side
effects and purity before starting. Then do them under gradually
increasing controlled and supervised conditions. Never experiment with
drugs. 
There is always a documented lab record of their effects. Know your
suppliers and don't get the wrong ones! The best recommendation is don't
do drugs. Your Mind, Body and Spirit can achieve better and more lasting
results. (As I mentioned previously, some natural herbal drinks and
incenses seem to aid meditation and ritual. We'll discuss those next
week).  Well there we have it!  All the different ways to achieve
illumination to Awen!

(End of Celtic Workshop #8 - The "Rite of 3 Rays" and the "Gift of
Awen")
        "Celtic Workshop #9 -  The use of Herbs and Potions"
        
The role of herbs in healing, Magick, ceremonies and rituals as well as
in mind alteration were presented and discussed in detail. The effects
of the most popular Druidic herbs and potions were detailed and
discussed. Some reformatting was done on the transcript for clarity's
sake as well. A final note!!!! Please exercise caution around most of
these herbs!! Some of them are considered to be POISONS! The effects of
some of the others are very powerful in areas of "mind alteration".  The
author of one of the texts, used as a reference, presents his suggested
methods for how the Druids used these herbs (they are ONLY used in a
greatly dilluted state!). Once again I urge caution and good judgement
before proceeding. All in all, the Workshop participants evidenced a
very thorough respect and understanding of the use and effects of these
herbs.

Entering Workshop/Seminar 1 room...

                      "Druidic Use of Herbs"
 
We must look at many sources to determine how the Druids used drugs and
herbs. Some of these sources are historical (such as the Greek and Roman
historians). Other sources are the traditions of the Bards and Seanchai.
Still others are the folk remedies and fables of the major Celtic areas
of the world (Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Britain).  We can also look
to information that comes from the inspired "Awen" of others (such as
Llewellyn Sion of Glamorgan and Douglas Monroe).  Archaelogical evidence
is also being found (the bodies of sacrificial or other burial victims
have been recently discovered). Each of these types of sources will be
matched against the others (where possible) to give us the best possible
idea of how Druids worked with drugs and herbs.
 
A quote from one the ancients, Pliny, a Roman, referring to the Druid
veneration of mistletoe:
 
"Seldom was the Mistletoe found growing upon the Oak, but on such
occasion, the Druids gathered it with due religious ceremony, (if
possible on the 6th day of the new Moon-when the influence of the orb
was waxing, and said to be at its height.  Following an elaborate 
3224

banquet, a white-clad priest cut the plant from  the oak tree with a
golden sickle, while another Druid held out a white cloak for its
reception. They believed that the Mistletoe, immersed in water within a
cauldron, would impart fecundity to barren animals, and that it is the
antidote for all poisons - its name meaning 'all healing.'"

(2-1,Freepowder)      there are 2 varietys of Mistletoe.... american and
european, the effects of them are almost opposite... european lowers BP,
american raises.... the *berries* of either are deadly poisonous. GA

(2-11,Rhianna)        Foxglove is another example - Digitalis (which
comes from (foxglove) is a poison, yet it's used for treating heart
patients.

(2-28,cherokee)       my gt grandma used mistle toe to bring prople out
of fevers and unconsciousness.  aspirin bark is poisonous too. its all
in how you prepare it

                      "The 16 Leeches of Diancecht"
 
Diancecht was the physician of the Tuatha de Dannan.  He healed their
wounded during and after their Battles with the Fomorai and the
Firbolgs. He is the God of Herbs and Medicines.
 
The following list contains herbs listed in "the 21 Lessons of Merlin"
and contains their correspondences to the four elements as well as their
applications. How to prepare a suitable "store" of these medicines is
also given. The recommended dossages are also given.  Note: Some of
these herbs can be considered "POISONS"!  I heartily recommend using
extreme caution with them. I have attempted to identify those that may
be considered harmful. Please proceed at your own risk. I must say that
3225

generally Monroe stays away fron poisonous herbs in topical or internal
medicines. He does use some very dangerous substances in some of his
recommended incenses. a long list will follow please bear with me!<G>

Mistletoe preparation to each before use. Since it was considered "all
heal".
 
                      "Draughts of Inspiration" (Only one is given)
 
These drinks are thought to instill the correct state of mind  required
for "Awen". According to Monroe, nine exist in total, though only one is
given in his book. Perhaps we can discover the others? I suggest that
the other tree barks that were used are from the red chestnut, white
chestnut, Elm, Beech, Larch, Oak and Fir trees. I would guess these
based upon Hints contained in "Practical Celtic Magick" by Murry Hope.
I also would guess that ivy was used in a draught based upon information
from Scott Cunningham's "Encyclopedia of Magickal Herbs".
 
                          5 tablespoons of spring water
                          1 pinch Evening Primrose Flowers
                          1 pinch Black Willow Bark
                          1 pinch Thyme
 
sit in Glass bottle (closed in the Sun) for 3 days strain/ add 1 tsp
apple cider vinegar before use add 1 tsp chlorophyll (alfalfa) take 3
drops subligually prior to Magickal Workings with trees/plants.
 
                        "Threshold Smoke"
 
These concotions are used to aid one in having an Otherworldly ex-
perience. They are cast upon the flames of a fire. Please note that some
of the ingredients are POISON! and that another one of them is con-
sidered "illegal". The use of these herbs are indicated to aid solitary
meditations in the deep woods. Be aware that they will induce "Dark
Visions" and reveal your inner fears. According to Monroe, the Druids
required one to master such fears to be in tune with Nature and to
achieve "Balance"..I recommend that none of them be tried when unsuper-
vised and I also recommend extreme caution.
 
                      To make the incense:
 
                              Blend and compound the following plants:
                              Neckweede (Hemp)
                              Nightshade (Belladonna) (poison) 
                              Ghostflower (Datura)
                      Keep in a dark (light free) box.
 
                      Burn as an incense to facilitate "threshold" 
                      and "traveling" works.
 
3227

                          "The Spirit of the Mandrake"
 
This incense is used to attain a state of altered consciousness for
resolving one's inner fears and becoming one with the Spirit of the Land
and its animal Nature. I caution anyone considering using it to be aware
that Mandrake is considered a POISON! This herb is used during the Night
of the Wild Hunt that we discussed last week.
 
Toss dried Mandrake (poison) root upon a bed of hot coals or embers and
let the smoke cause you to travel within the darkness of the night. May
apple, Peony; Ginseng or Briony roots may be substituted (also con-
sidered poisonous!).
 
                     "The Song of Bluestar"
Another herb used to achieve altered states was the Bluestar flower or
the Blue Morning Glory. This  plant is considered poisonous! Do not eat
or drink anything made with it and handle it with care. Monroe suggests
drying the flowers and seeds to make an incense for a rite of assumption
or tapping into Powers. This  might also be called "mind expansion". 
(The same plants have been used to create LSD in recent times, so I am
not surprised that they are used here). I'm not advocating that anyone
of you try this incense, but Monroe says the Druids did. I'm not
surprised.
 
Here is the essence of the trip or rite of assumption:
 
"I will be as a Bluestar upon a field of Green, circling upward towards
a golden Sun."
                      .... translation by D.W.Nash
 
The Druids believed all life was interrelated from the lowest forms to
the highest. This quote from the ancient Welsh document, the Mathnawai, 
shows their philosopy:
 
                      "I died as a mineral and became a plant,
                      I died as a plant and rose to an animal,
                      I died as an animal and I was a man.
                      Why should I fear?
                      When was I ever less dying?
                      Yet once more I shall die as a man,
                      to soar in the Blessed Realm;
                      but even from godhood
                      I must pass on...."

One further quote from "The Gorchan of Maeldrew":  "Each atom an
evolving life, each blade of grass a potential soul."

               "The Draughts of Oblivion"
 
I give here the "fast" (meaning quick to make) version of Celtic drinks
and libations from the "21 Lessons of Merlin" as well as the festivals
at which they are used:
 
                              May Mead for Beltaine

Add a half ounce of each of the following to 1 gallon of your favorite
white wines:
                              heather flowers, meodowsweet, woodruff
3228

                              leaves. Let sit for about 6 hours. Filter
                              and chill before serving.
 
                              Midsummer Ale 
 
Add a half ounce of each of the following to 1 gallon of your favorite
red wines:
                              fresh oak leaves, chamomille, red rose
                              petals. Let sit for about 24 hours. Add  
                            9 tablespoons of honey and 1 teaspoon  of
                              vanilla. Filter and chill before serving.
 
                              Samhain Absinthe
        
Add a 2 teaspoons of each of the following to 2 pints of your favorite
port wines:
                              wormwood, dried apple/mint leaves, dried
                              pumpkin blossoms. Let sit for about 1    
                          week. Filter through muslin and bottle.      
                        Garnish with raisins and cloves before         
                     serving.
 
                              Midwinter Mulsa
 
Add a half ounce of each of the following to 2 quarts of your favorite
dry white wines:              crushed juniper berries, wintergreen,
                              Elder Flowers. let sit for about 6 hours. 
                              Filter and chill before serving. Garnish 
                              with a sprigg of green pine or hot with  
                            a cinnamon stick

Now these are drinks I can get excited about!  I think we can all see
that Druids used a variety of herbs in their work....from "visions" to
partying.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Celtic Workshop #10 - 
                   The Act of "Becoming" and The Charm of "Summoning"
        
Tonight's workshop is advertised to cover the following topics and I
intend to give them all my best efforts at explanation.  Tonight's
topics are:

               How to actually influence your surroundings. 

          How to perform Weather Magick, to call animals to you, to
improve your crops and to influence the outcome of events. 
  
          How to discover your past life, find your Inner Teacher or
Self. 
  
          How to summon "Spirits" to your presense.

I am being ambitious in talking about these topics!<G> I trust we can
cover them all tonight and I also hope to have many contributions by all
of you regarding your own personal experiences in these areas. We will
learn from our "Inner Druids"! <G>

The key words to remember tonight are "Becoming" and "Summoning". They
along with "Will" and "Authority" are the basis of most Druidic and
Celtic Magicks.

What do I mean by "Becoming"? What does this act have to do with Magick?
How did Druidsdo this? I asked myself all of these questions before
making this act a topic for tonight's workshop. The inspiration for the
act of "Becoming" is the "Song of Amergin" from the ancient Irish
manuscript the Leabhar Gabha'la (Book of Invasions). Hear now the words
of the Druid Amergin:

                        "             The Mystery

                         I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                         I am the wave of the ocean.
                         I am the murmur of the billows.
                         I am the ox of the seven combats.
                         I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                         I am a beam of the Sun.
                         I am the fairest of plants.
                         I am a wild boar in valour.
                         I am a salmon in the water.
                         I am a lake in the plain.
                         I am a word of science.
                         I am a point of the lance in battle.
                         I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                         Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                         on the mountain?
                         Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                         Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
3230
                                                          (If not I)"

This was the translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work "Literary
History of Ireland". This poem was once as well known in the Celtic
world as the "Lord's Prayer" is in today's world. It is said to be the
first verse made by the Mileseans as they arrived in Ireland (circa 1000
BC). This is also an incantation by a mighty Druid and is a good
illustration of the act of "Becoming". Amergin is using the Magickal Law
of Identification that is given by Isaac Bonewits in his book "Real
Magick":

"The Law of Identification ...states that by maximum association between
your metapattern and that of another entity, you can actually "become"
that entity and wield its power."

Bonewits is a Neo Druid and the founder of the group A'r nDrai'ocht
Fe'in (ADF for short though it really means "Our Druidic Magick" in
Gaeilge).  This act of "Becoming" is one that is not lightly undertaken.
The danger exists of being trapped within the other entity (whether
natural, human or spiritual). I suggest you not actually try this sort
of thing until you know your True Will (exactly who you really are
without self delusion).  This was also true of the Greek and the
Egyptian Mysteries. Their first and major requirement was "Gnothi se
auton", literally "Know thyself"! The ability to control and return to
one's being is linked directly to one's knowledge of Self. Sometimes
this process goes the otherway as well, as when a Wiccan "Draws Down the
Moon". The threefold Goddess actually Manifests within the High
Priestess (HPS) in such a ceremony. She who has no Name is benevolent,
usually, so that this possession results in the HPS afterwards being
returned to control of her own body. "Becoming" is a two way street and
a matter of "Will".  

Now that we know a little about the act of "Becoming", I think you can
appreciate just how great a Druid that Amergin was....he "became"
multiple entities at the same time in his Invocation of the Mystery. He
controlled all of these elemental powers and made them his own. This act
of Power allowed the Mileseans to land upon Eireann though they were
opposed by the Magicks of the Tuatha de Danaan. He also lived to do
other Magicks (though I must say that his invocation of Ireland is
rumored to have caused him to marry and join the de Danaan within the 
spirit world of the Sidhe). We must remember that Amergin was a Druid
and so had studied his arts intensivly for anywhere from 12 to 20 years
as a minimum. He was able to return to hinself after such Magical
Working because he knew his True Self and Will. This strong connection
is the Way of Return for us all. I urge that you all exercise due
caution when "Becoming". Know yourself first.

Another saying worthy of note while discussing the act of "Becoming" is
a common saying of the ancient world that I quote from Doreen Valiente's
book "Natural Magic": "Ten measures of magic were given to the world.
Egypt took nine. The rest took one."

I include this saying here to establish one other connection....that of
the Druids to the Egyptians. The lineage of Amergin and the Gaels
includes his mother Scota (daughter of the Egyptian Pharoh) as well as
Mile and Niall "of the Languages" a Scythian prince from Syria. No small
wonder then that Pliny, a noted ancient scholar, says of the Druids in
his work "Natural History" that the Druids practiced Magick with such
elaborate ritual that it would almost appear that it was they "who had
3231

taught the Persians". These are none other than the Magi or "wise men"
from whom the word Magick is derived. Another ancient historian, Dio
Chrysostum groups the Druids together with the Persian, Hindu and
Egyptian priesthoods regarding their use of magical powers. While I'm
connecting Magical schools, I may as well say that Liber Al vel Legis
(The Book of the Law) is the channeled revelation of the Egyptian
dieties Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Otherwise known as Isis, Osiris
and Horus) Horus is two in one, Horus and Harpocrates or Set/Apophis).
We have already seen the use of these three godnames in the "Rite of
Three Rays" from a previous workshop. This was the intonation of the
sounds "IAO" used when invokiing the One Power. In Thelemic Magick the
Book of the Law is the basis for the revelation of a "New Aeon" or "New
Age". It was channeled in 1904 by Aleister Crowley 90 years ago this
month. "Do what thou wilt is the whole of the Law". "Love is the Law,
Love under Will". (caps are mine).

I have digressed quite a bit here but I think the time is well spent.
Celtic Magick is tied through the Druids to the Egyptians and the
Persians to a far older Magick arising out of Summeria and from there
beyond time. It is true and powerful Magick and I give the same caution
to you that I gave about herbs last workshop....think long and hard and
with great deliberation before undertaking this journey. Once the path
is taken, the journey must be completed.

Now I finally get to my first topic of the night!  <G>:

            "How to actually influence your surroundings" 
    
The key to any act influencing the world around us is to be in tune and
in touch with it first. You must hear the tune before you can change the
music or even write your own song. I suggest a lot of meditation in
Nature. Find a spot that "speaks" to the Pagan within you. Be at Peace
and "feel" the pulse of Nature, the God and the Goddess. Once this
rapport has been established, one is ready to influence the surround-
ings. The Druids left us few writings concerning their spells and
Magicks.  We must "rediscover" these Works by looking at the Magicks
that are done in the world today and by Using our "Druid filters" and
"Celtometers"!! <G>  I have included examples of such "Natural Magics"
from my own experiences, the experiences of other Witches and Druids as
well as those that I found in the writings of Doreen Valiente, Bonewits
and Scott Cunningham.

                   "How to perform Weather Magick" 

For weather Magickal examples I turned to our very own Thunder Being,
Shadow Hawk, shaman and wizard extraordinaire!<G> He obliged me with a
few examples:

     The first example involves the  control of weather fronts and rain.
Our favorite shaman uses the techniques of dancing and drumming to
attain a higher state. He invokes the Lightning beings and they join the
dance with him. By being so in tune with them he can ask that they do
his bidding. If he must act upon an existing weather front, he sends his
"power animal", Dragon into the clouds. Dragon is a manifestation of
this Shaman in the power planes. Dragon then interacts with the clouds
and controls the storms. When the work is done, he is recalled to his
shaman. The use of such a "power animal" or Magickal construct allows
the wise shaman to "become" one with the elements of the storm and 
3232

influence them without "losing himself" in their wild natures. The
connection is retained with the Self (Shadow Hawk) back upon the ground
while the power animal (Dragon) works among the clouds. The use of such
Power has its price.... Shadow Hawk suffers sever headaches for three
days following these episodes.

The second example of how our Dark Shaman uses the weather for Magick is
in charging his Magickal tools: his sword, wand and athame. During a 200
MPH hurricane, he faced the Power of the storm, shouting out the
invocation of the Quarters, forming a Magickal Circle and calling the
storms Power into his sword, his wand and his athame. He also captured
the storm's rain in a cauldron for later magickal workings. Can't you
see him with the storm's winds lashing at his cloak? Sword upraised as
lightnings crash all around him, exploding in sparks and reflecting in
eerie blue lights off the steel of his blade and the aura of his
Magick!!! He has used these tools in many Powerful workings.

                     "How to call animals to you" 

This is a matter of "becoming" the animal in your mind and "willing" it
to come to you.  Actually the "Beastmaster" movie illustrated this
technique quite well. Most good hunters do this subconsciously and
naturally.
           
                     "How to improve your crops"  
          
In this Working, invoke no other spirits than your own. Burn no fires
nor incenses. Carry four stones with you that have been blessed by you
in a previous ceremony. Set these stones to define the area that is to
be planted. Cast a Magickal Circle within this field. Sit upon the
ground and place both hands upon the earth at your sides. Feel the
earth, it's dampness, its fertility, its calm. Reflect upon your needs
and the crops you are about to plant.  Next recite a suitable chant or
poem. I like this one: 

                               "Go maith raibh agat, na mBande'.
                                Go maith raibh agat, na De'.
                                Go maith raibh agat, talamh me'ith.

                                Cuirim fad beannacht na greine thu.
                                Cuirim fad beannacht na gealai thu.
                                Cuirim fad beannacht mo chroi' thu.
        
                                Go me'adai Bhri'de do sto'r san 
                                         ba'isteach de earrach.
                                Go me'adai Danu do sto'r san 
                                        greine te de tsaamhradh.
                                Go me'adai Dagdha do sto'r 
                                       san gaoth ple'isiu'rtha fo'mhar."

As I sit and reflect upon the bounty that the Land has given me I give
back to the earth of my own personal Power. I remember the blessings it
has bestowed to me and my pleasure in its well being.  After a suitable
amount of reflection and meditation, I arise to do my plowing and to
plant my seeds for another turn of the Wheel.
      
               "How to influence the outcome of events" 

3233

I try to create a feeling of Positive Magick within me. I banish all
negative thoughts. I surround myself with a glow of positive golden
energy. I tap the flows of the earth and the sky and "project" a
creative field all around me. I find that this works well in casinos and
just before having important meetings. It helps to strongly visualize
the outcome that is desired and to see the results occur and not the
actions that cause them. Let events sort themselves as they may. Let the
Magick work. Be patient and await the rewards.
 
                   "How to discover your past life"

Some people use tapes and hypnosis to do past life regressions. Perhaps
some of you have and can share those experiences with us tonight. I find
that what works best for me is to read about a time to understand the
events of that period and to set the stage for my Work. I then allow
myself to "daydream" and reflect about that time and to see myself
within it. What usually happens next is that no revelation comes to me
immediately. I maintain my focus over perhaps as long as three days
constantly checking to see if my "dream" search has produced any
results. When I least expect it, sudden revelation will show me a scene
from a past life and my part in it. It's like seeing a photograph from
an album for me.
      
              "How to find your Inner Teacher or Self"  
      
This is the start of all real Magick, finding your True Will. Many
techniques exist for doing this in a variety of books, everything from
"the 21 Lessons" to Donald Michael Kraig's "Modern Magic". I will relate
how it happened to me. I studied the works of Magick, Science and
Religions (as many as I could find). I sought for the Truth that was
external to me.  I was a bulldog chasing down many paths and wrestling
with many concepts. The Truth eluded me, always constantly out of mu
grasp....the fox and the grapes. I was incredibly frustrated.  One night
I gave it all up. As I lay in the Silence of my mind, I left all of the
mundane world behind and suddenly I was surrounded by Spirit in a place
not a place. It was not within me...I had ceased to exist I was the
student and the Spirit was the teacher. Since then, if I have need of an
answer, I create a sacred space for me to be silent and I await
enlightenment. I listen to my Inner Guide.  Sometimes the lessons are
easy and othertimes I have to learn the hard way. (Frequently I get off
of My Path and am "guided back" with many "object" lessons kicking me in
the seat of the pants<G>)! I would be interested in hearing how anyone
else found their True Will.  Mine search was long and hard and I still
stray in confusion at times!<G>

                       "How to summon 'Spirits'"

I will give an example of how to summon the Spirit of Merlin as found in
the book "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Monroe. Before we begin
there is a chant we must learn in old Welsh:

                                "Bedd Ann ap lleian ymnewais fynydd
                                      lluagor llew Ymrais
                                 Prif ddewin Merddin Embrais."

         the meaning:

                               "The grave of the nun's son on 
3234

                                Newais Mountain:
                                        Lord of Battle, Llew Embrais, 
                                        Chief Magician, Myrddin Emrys."

        the pronunciation:

                                "BETH AHN ahp T-Lay'in, eem-NEW-ais
                                 FEEN-ith
                                    T-loo-AH-gor T-loo EEM-rais
                                 Preeve DEW-in MEER-thin EHM-rihs."

I find that using an unusual language in a chant helps me to free myself
from the chains of the mundane and allows me to focus upon the Working. 
After memorizing the above chant one must search for a suitable
site....a grave yard or burial ground that is isolated from prying eyes
and situated upon a hill. This sounds hard but is not impossible to do.
I know of such a place where my great, great grandfather and grandmother
are buried upon a hill beneath a copse of trees in a farmers fields.
Many such spots exist... though work can find them (and hopefully also
permission to use them). 

Pick a suitable night for the ritual, Samhain being the absolute best
night. Gather nine pumpkins that are carved with faces (though candle
holders will do...just not as spooky).  Set the circle up the day before
the ritual as you don't want any distractions from your Work. Arrange
the pumpkins with candles around you in a circle (about arms width) with
the faces looking outward. Always light the candles from within the
circle. Pick a suitably soulful dirge (for meditation and mood setting) 
from your favorite songbook (Monroe suggests his but you know what you
like better). Sing this song as you meditate and reflect upon the
Working. Place an iron cauldron within the circle upon a bed of coals.
Into this cauldron place a mixture of an herb, a flower and a tree
(Monroe suggests using 1 part wormwood, 2 parts Ghostflower (Datura) and
3 parts Yew (juniper or cypress) as an incense mixture. (Store bought
incenses work just as well and can be burned in an incense burner
instead of a cauldron). Start the entire ritual at 30 minutes before
Midnight.  At precisely Midnight throw additional incense on the coals
and recite the above invocation nine times without stopping. "Become"
one with the chant! See into the Darkness! Expect the coming of Myrddin
Emrys! Sit quietly and await the coming of the shade of Merlin! You may
ask for the answers to three questions. Release the shade by extinguish-
ing the fire and incense completely, then extinguish the 9 circling
fires of the pumpkin heads. You can  now pack up and leave. The key to
successfully working this Magick is setting the mood, performing the
meditations and reflections and reciting the invocation properly. The
ritual can be adapted to allow you to invoke other Spirits as well to
equal effect.

The ancient Gaels would do similar rituals to communicate with the dead.
They would usually lay  and sleep upon the grave of the person to be
summoned while fasting, until the shade appeared. This process was not 
 lightly undertaken by them, as the dead could be quite dangerous to the
living, wanting to regain the pleasures of the flesh (hence the need for
the Magickal Circle of pumpkins and light). In a previous workshop I
told how the Ta'in Bo' Cuailnge was recovered by a young Druid sleeping
upon the grave of Feargus Mac Rioch. I'd like to caution you all once
more to do these rituals only when in dire need.  That's why it's
important to do two things...
3235

                        1. Always work within a Circle.
                        2. Have someone there that can aid you if things 
                          get out of hand. This means severingthe      
                         connection and banishing the entity.
This is also why it's so important to know your True Will. When you have
that anchor you can come back from anywhere. I know... because I have
done it. It's like climbing a hill though...

(2-28,cherokee)         Rhianna, I think as od said it's important to
remember that you are working with very powerful energies. You must be
pure and centered before doing the work. The indians believe it is not
possible for an animal to take over a human because the animals are here
as guides who keep us close to our source.


Celtic Workshop #11 - "Walking between the Worlds" and "Journeys on the
Wheel"
        
We met on Tuesday evening because the online Bealtaine Ritual was on
Monday. The topics of discussion were Out of Body Experiences (OOBE),
Astral Travel and Inner Journeys. An example of a "pathworking" on
Fionn's Wheel was given.

Tonight's workshop discusses Astral Travel and Inner Journeying.
Tonight's topics are:
 
                                Out of Body Experiences
 
                                Astral Travel
 
                                Example Inner Journey on Fionn's Wheel
 
Tonight we talk briefly about the subject of Out of Body Experiences
(OOBE). Thisexperience is the means by which one can effect or achieve
Magick. It is central to the methods behind the Magickal Law: "As Above,
So Below". A complete workshop will be offered here soon by another, so
I touch briefly on these techniques tonight.

Three excellent books on these subjects are:
        
                                Astral Projection by Denning and
                                Phillips.
 
                                Journeys Out of the Body by
                                Robert A. Monroe.
 
                                Traveling With Power by Ken
                                Eagle Feather.
 
I will present the results of an Inner Journey later, using Fionn's
Wheel as a guide to the Astral Archtypes within each of us.
 
The basic techniques of OOBE are these: "disassociation" and "release". 
Another word for "disassociation" is "meditating".  Meditating allows us
to break free from the conditioning forced upon our thoughts by the ever
so mundane, so-called "normal" world. It places our mind into a rhythm
that allows it to "vibrate" in resonance to other realities (some might
say other dimensions or even other worlds). I achieve this state by 
3236

going through a process of literally forcing myself to "relax". I relax
my extremities first, then my legs, arms, trunk, head, breathing, heart
and lastly, my mind. The body is calmed by physically lifting, then
releasing a body part and "feeling" the waves of relaxation flow inward
and up the body. This is done in succession until only the mind is
active. 
 
Once totally within the mind, relaxation of thought must occur. I
achieve mental quietness by visualizing a totally "Black" void into
which all thoughts, feelings and flickers of thoughts and feelings are
fed.  This process continues until all is "black".  I float before a sea
of Darkness. I see nothing, I feel nothing , I am nothing. Once this
state is achieved, one may proceed to "travel" or have an OOBE.
 
 
                          "Leaving the Body"
 
To leave the body requires an additional two steps: an increase in the
vibratory rate of the Spirit and a "pushing" out of the body. I am lucky
that I seem to have discovered these techniques while experimenting on
my own. The proper level of Spiritual vibration or "ecstasy" is achieved
by further relaxation and through belief or "Will". I totally believe
that my Spirit can leave my body and do anything. This focused and
concentrated belief through Will is the essense of all Magick. It is
absolutely necessary to achieve results. Some might call this process
"faith". It is the stuffby which mountains are moved and with which
entire worlds and even universes are created.  It is also the basis of
Love and it is through Love that most of us discover the Power that we
all have to create and perform Magick.
 
Everyone from Ahura Mazda to Jesus to Crowley says the same thing about
this process. Love is Power. It is the fundamental requirement for
creative Work. Let us soar upon the wings of eagles and fly on the wings
of doves into the Astral.  I "key" the process of leaving my body to
seeing in every direction at the same time. This is impossible for me to
visualize or to consider in my "normal" existence while contained within
the physical shell of my skull and the confines of my body.  
 
The "Darkness" I have achieved by relaxation of the mind is seen as a
balloon. I see only one side of it. As my Magick squeezes this balloon,
it expands toward me and through me until I am surrounded by the
Darkness. While this process of transformation and metamorphesis occurs,
I maintain constant contact with all aspects of the Darkness that I
encounter when the passage is complete, I see the inside and the outside
of the Dark Bubble.  I see in two directions! This is one step. I take
as many steps as are necessary, piling belief upon work and work upon
belief until no direction is unseen. I see myself from without and
myself from within. I float and I create.  I "travel" and I do anything
I can conceive.  My existence is a "waking dream". I am the master of
Reality. I am a new creation! This is the essence of OOBE. Where one
goes from here is for a more advanced workshop. I trust the New Age
forum OOBE Workshop will be just such an experience for all of us. I
plan to be a part of it and I trust you will all join me there.
 
               "A Journey Through the Veil at Bealtaine"
 
In the spirit of this Bealtaine season and to Honor the Mother of Summer
and the Lord of the Greenwood, I took out a copy of Fionn's Wheel to use
3237

as a focus for my reflections and musings. I found a quiet spot with no
distractions and I gazed upon the Magickal Oghams of the Wheel. I sought
guidance about the world around us and clarity as to my purpose. As I
gazed upon the symbols, a mist began to form and I slowly began to
journey. The veil between the worlds is thinnest on the spindle of the
Wheel this night. What follows is the story of my journey upon the
pathways of the Wheel:  (A voice within my mind spoke to me.)
 
"Tonight is a night of Magick. Come with me into the rath ..enter the
home of the Sidhe. Let us walk the moonways and take the path of the
journey within:" 
 
                        "The Mists of Draiocht"
 
<The mists arise in the meadow and gather in whorls and spirals. The air
is filled with mystery. A strange call sounds...
                        can you hear it?...shivers and silvers..
                        bells?... or ... harp strings and laughter?
                        We are called...called are we....called...
                        we must go....we must go...we must go...
                        Wrapped in wraiths of shimmering silver..
                        flowing, ever flowing from without..
                        time is not here...reality dissolves...
                        consciousness journeys within.
                        Into the night i must go...on spirit wings,
                        leaving this world behind!! I must go!
                        Billowing fog and music calls to me!
                        I have no legs...the mist rises! ...
                        I ride the waves...no arms..none! The
                        Power flows within always within.....
                        within...always......always..........
                        within......I float I float I float..
                        Only me in the silence and the drums...
                        Only me...the spirit me survives!
                        And my heart lives on in echoes! It 
                        calls to me across the void as I journey. 
                        Hear the beat of my heart's drum...hear
                        the beat of life's blood...my thoughts
                        are a rhythm...a drumming, a rhythm of
                        life and thought across the shimmering
                        moonways....come within .....within..

                        wondering about myself...Who am I? What
                        does this mean? What awaits me? What awaits

                        and know my journeys continue....It's
                        knowledge is my shield. I am a sword and
                        the fires of summer beckon to us all.
 
Such is the nature of an Inner Journey. I continue to see this journey
and to reflect upon its meanings to me and to who I am. I recommend that
each of you also undertake such journeys for yourselves. Go within to
your Inner Guide and travel the Wheel.  Journey the pathways of Fionn to
Wisdom and Knowledge. Beannacht libh!  That was my experience in an
Inner Journey.

Celtic Workshop #12 - The "Outer Darkness", the "Dragon's Eye" and the 
"Many Speckled Rainment"

This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
the basis of Druid Magick or Drai'ocht. We discussed the "Dragon" or
"Serpent" Power that is inherit in the Land. We touched on the many
different areas of knowledge and discipline necessary to be a Druid. We
also discussed the Mysteries of "Death" and "Rebirth". Some preliminary
socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation and discussion:

Here is what I hope to cover tonight:
 
                             The Road to the Grove.
                             The Druidic concepts of Being. 
                             The use of the Power of the Land
                             in the Rite of the "Dragon's Eye". 
                             The "ley lines" and the "death roads". 
                             The attainment of Druidic enlightenment 
                             (Initiation to the Inner Mysteries) 
                             Authority and the "Many Speckled Rainment"
        
                        "The Road to the Grove"
 
There are many paths to Magick though only One True Magick IMHO. The
Grove is a home to this Power as is the Circle and the Temple. How do we
attain the Power to do Magick for ourselves and for all of humanity? Let
us look to see what the Pathways were for others.
 
                             "The Ancient Druidic Orders"
 
I have discussed the Ancient orders or levels of Druids in a previous
workshop.  I include them here for the sake of our current discussion. 
 
Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the epics, chants,
spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These works were
memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to a higher or
inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be rendered with
feeling so that the listener would be spell bound and consequently could
relive the event. The Irish Druids had the following classes of Bards:
 
                            Class          # of Epics
                         __________________________________________ 
                            Driseg         20   (the Beginner)
                            Foclaic        30   (Advanced beginner)
                            Cili           100  (Journeyman)
                            Anraid         175  (Master/Warrior)
                            Ollomh         175+ (Doctor/Judge)
 
It is to be expected that the lawyers, seers, scientists, judges, and
clergy of the Draoi underwent similarly lengthy training periods.
 
                      "The Cloak of Many Colors"
 
In the Christian Bible, Joseph was awarded a cloak of many colors by his
father because he was beloved among all of his brothers.  Due to the
jealousy and greed of his brothers, Joseph was also sold into slavery in
Egypt and suffered a "death" to his old way of life.  Because he was
open to wisdom and could perceive the meanings within signs and dreams,
3244

he became the chief counselor to the Pharaoh and rose above his death to
"new life". Just as the history of the Gaels is tied to Egypt, so the
rites of Druids are tied to this idea of "many colors" and rebirth.
Please recall that the Mileseans descend from the Pharaohs  of Egypt and
that their Druids were said to be better Magi than the Persians. To be
as good a Druid as Joseph, one must learn the art of interpreting
dreams, divination and eloquence. This is a mighty job and worthy of us
all!
                        "My Own Personal Paths"
 
When I embarked upon the quest for my roots and for the nature of
Drai'ocht, I was immediately impressed by two things: 
 
                        1. The Druids were acute and patient observers
                        of Nature.
 
                        2. The Druids were the scholars and scientists
                        of their day.
 
Using these two ideas, I created a color-coded series of educational
levels for myself in my quest into the secrets of the Draoi.
 
I believe there are five areas of knowledge in the Mysteries: 
 
                                Knowledge of Self, 
                                Knowledge of the World,
                                Knowledge of the Spirit, 
                                Knowledge of Magick, 
                                Knowledge of the ONE.
 
The entire process of learning and growing never stops. As a minimum I
have required myself to know the following:
 
                        Knowledge of Self  (The Blue Level)
                        __________________________________________

        __________________________________________
 
The Student must know the physical world.  The Student must know how the
laws of Nature work.  The Student must be Holistic with Creation.  The

様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様
3245

            The Knowledge of the Spirit (The Yellow Level)
            ______________________________________________
 
The Student must know the Spirit within.  The Student must study the
Religions of Humanity.  The Student must make a Spiritual Journey.  The
Student must leave the body and walk the Moon Ways. (OOBE) The Student
must see the origins and travels of the Spirit within. (PAST LIFE
REGRESSION)  The Student must Know the Spirit in Music, Colors, Symbols
and Life.  The Student must hear the Akasha.
 
             The Knowledge of Magick (The Orange Level)
             __________________________________________
 
The Student must read the Great Works (Cayce, Crowley, Enoch, Fortune,
Hermes, Jung, Ogham, Pythagorus, Qabalah, Science, Solomon, Thelema,
etc.)  The Student must learn to "See." The Student must learn to
"Divine".  The Student must learn to "Shield."  The student shall learn
to "Speak."  The student shall learn to "Heal."  The student shall learn
to "Travel."  
 
              The Knowledge of the ONE (The Red Level)
             __________________________________________
 
The Student must create and lead a Ritual.  The Student must focus the
three Powers (Earth, Self, ONE).  The Student must perform the Great
Rite.  The Student must change Reality.  The Student must perform the
rite of "Making."  The Student must be reborn and become ONE.
 
After passing through all levels successfully, the Student then becomes
the Teacher and can wear the  White, Multi-speckled or the Dark Robes of
their choice.  This is my path to Drai'ocht. You alone can choose the
proper path to your Inner Light of Whiteness or Darkness. All colors are
one color. All Drai'ocht is ONE DRAI'OCHT!
 
                  "The Druidic concepts of Being" 
                   ------------------------------- 
I would like to quickly touch on some Druidic concepts about states of
being. These states of being correspond to the previous cosmology that
we discussed in workshop 5. (Time does not permit me to make a complete
discussion of these topics tonight. I may add another workshop to cover
them more completely in the future.)
 
                "Barddas and The Circles of Being"
                ---------------------------------- 
The Welsh Bardic work "Barddas" contains a description of the three
Circles of Being: 
          1.  Abred or the Realm of Matter
              (The physical world of form)
 
          2.  Gwynyd or the Realm of Blessedness
              (The Magickal Astral world of Spirits)
 
           3.  Ceugant or the Realm of Infinities 
               (That which is the home of the
                God/desses and the Blessed)
 


3246

These states of being are separated by three veils that must be passed:
 
1.  Annwn or "Dark Forgetfulness"
    (This is the gap or veil that must be passed to achieve birth and
     rebirth in the Physical World.)
 
2.  Cythraul or "the Ghost"
    (This is the veil that must be passed to achieve enlightenment.)
 
3.  Lyonesse or "the Isle of the Blest"
     (This is the final veil that is passed when one has achieved
complete enlightenment and complete growth.)
 
"Awen" or "illumination" is like a lightning bolt that can come to us
across these veils and bring us knowledge and understanding.
 
The key to our Power and true wills is how well we are able to pass
between these states of being. I will discuss some of these techniques
next.
 
         "Circles of Thought" or, "The Cyclatron of the Soul"
        
One of the marvels of modern science is the atom smasher or particle
accelerator.  Another name for these powerful devices is a "cyclatron".
This is basically a phased arrray of electromagnetic devices that take
charged particles and accelerate them to tremendous speeds around a
circular field until they approximate the speed of light or at least
they approach relativistic velocities. The particles are then smashed
into a target and the history of the mutual destruction is observed and
recorded so that humanity may unlock the secrets of the Gods. I trust
that most of us here tonight have experienced this acceleration effect
within the vortex of our thoughts and Spirits. We strive mightily to
increase the relativistic mass of our thoughts so that we may observe
their behavor as they approach God-like reality in their manifestions.
Whirr and strive as we might, we are doomed to the universal restraints
of our own humanity in much the same manner as nuclear physicists are
limited by the unvirsal limits of "C" or light speeds (warp Factor 1,
Mr. Sulu!<G>). Such are the limits of thinking.
 
               "The Salmon Leap and the Shaman's Death"
        
I have gone through the process of questing for ultimate meaning in life
many times. Most of this effort has been exhausting as well as futile.
Only through extraordinary efforts have I actually attained results.
These results came about through quantum leaps of the mind and spirit
across the "void". Since the salmon is the totem of knowledge, I call
this leap the "Salmon Leap". It is very approprite to name it thus since
the "void" is actually "death" and the salmon "leap" up the streams of
it's birth to spawn new life from it's own death struggle. The ancients
also refered to mighty feats as a "Salmon Leap". We must experience the
"Shaman's Death" in order to attain our new life and knowledge. The
"Salmon Leap" brings us to a New Reality and altered state of Being.
Included in the initiation rites to all of the Great Mystery Schools was
just such a rite of Death and Rebirth. Anyone care to reveal their
secrets now?<G> OTO'ers? GD'ers? Druids? Wiccans? AMORC?  Freemasons?
Templars? Illumatti? Assassins? Channellers? Others? The floor is now
open. Let's hear the words of Life and the words of Death. Josey Wales
faces Ten Bears in the moment of Truth. The gauge is cast...the 
3247

challenge is issued. The floor is open to all comers!
 
                            "Enlightenment"
 
Coming through the "dark night of the soul" or the "Shaman's Death"
purifies and releases us so that we can experience illumination and
enlightenment. Our "darkness' and ignorance are burned away in the
flames of the Phoenix as we are reborn into the Light! Such a wonder!
The Akasha and all knowledge are there to be received! Our training and
our quest are rewarded. We are a new creation!
 
                          "The Dragon's Eye"
 
The "Dragon's Eye" is another word for Earth Magick or the Power
inherent to the Land that is at the root of the Celtic Soul. This is the
power of Excalibur or Caliborn, the sword of Arthur. It is the "Dragon's
Breath" that Merlin works with to create a Magickal Mist while using the
charm of "Making". We have already seen the "Eye of the Dragon" in a
previous workshop ritual. I would like to now open the floor for a
further discussion by everyone here as to how we sense this Power in the
Land and particularly how we sense it at many sacred sites such as
"Stone Circles", Raths, Menhirs, Hills, "Ley Lines", "Stonehenge",
"Avebury" or any other site of your experience. The floor is now open
for Magickal discussion!

Anyone else have a good story for how they've sensed the Power of the
Land? How it just is laying there waiting for the call?

(2-10,Freepowder)       Some time, when you can be alone for a while..
climb up into the moutains, my mountains are the Sierras get up high,
above treeline, and sit there, find a rock... where the wind blows all
the time and just sit. it may take a while maybe an hour, maybe a day...
but you will feel it.. strength more than power, but power just the same
coming up form the rocks... singing in the wind... when you have got it
right.. the animals will come you may not see them, the conys and the
birds but you will feel them too if you are lucky.  they will talk to
you not in words but in thoughts.  if you are ready your totem will make
itself known I have found that no great preparation is neccesary but for
an open heart and mind it happens for me everytime I go there which is
not nearly often enough oh! don't do this in a lightning storm <G>

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Beautiful Freepowder! A hymn to the Mother!
We can all sing the song of the Health of the Earth!  She is beautiful
still in some places and will be again in others as we....and I do mean
we.... all get together to release the Power of the Dragon!  THAT has
been safeguarded for us by our ancient Shamans within the Earth. I sense
that the keys for this Work are soon to be given to us all once more.

(2-15,Nan)              Well, I can think of many times that I've felt
the Power of the Land but I'll offer just a simple recent example:
Last week I gave my ankle a nasty sprain, I knew that one thing it
needed for healing was to walk barefoot on the land, so that's what I
did <g> in general I find that going barefoot on almost any ground
allows me to feel the power of the land......I don't do it long in the
snow though <g>.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         I'll bet!!!<G>  Many of the ancient sacred sites
are no longer in active use. I think that the day is rapidly approaching
3248

where the Land will call us to Work Magicks at such sites. We will
re-establish the "ley lines" of Power that are now just echoes of their
past. These lines and sites require a Human/Dragon magickal connection
to re-Power the grids that exist all across this planet. Many events 
occur today that point to this Work.

(2-15,Nan)              I just wanted to comment that a few years ago I
visited a more obscure stone circle and noticed by items left behind
that it had been recently used..... so not *all* the ancient sites are
inactive and I'm glad!

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         That's true! I believe Shadow Hawk told about
feeling serpent lines of Power beneath Avebury's Circles during a visit
there as well, though Stonehenge seemed inert. He told me recently that
he sensed that it could come "alive" again for the right combination of
persons working there. If that happened, it would have to be tended on
a regular basis. Too much of the Dragon sleeps at that site.  Myrdin
Emyrs sleeps nearby himself!  Anyone else have a "Dragon" sense?

(2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    Many of the american indians have the same
legends only we call it the serpent my great grandmother taught me to go
out at night and to feel  the serpent move beneath my feet and to listen
to the song it made in the wind.  We believe the time for the serpent to
rise is here [it is in the] spirit of the people and the land.  I have
been a healer in my past lives we used the crystals to awaken the
serpent when it was time.  That time is soon and I feel the serpent
singing to me.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Thank you My Princess!<G>  Some legends say that
crystals were used at Stonehenge as well. They were placed upon the tops
of the lentils there to provide a Power connection.  Perhaps the crystal
skulls will provide an answer.  I hope to see one in Miami next month.

(2-15,Nan)              All this talk of serpents reminded me of
Australia, where the Aborigines have the story of the rainbow serpent (I
think it may be part of a creation myth) there they call the ley lines
songlines. Bruce Chatwin wrote a wonderful book by that name that covers
a lot about the Aborginal beliefs

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         I want to check into that some more. Isn't it
also amazing that everyone connects the serpent to wisdom ....even the
Christians do it!<G> Though I must say they try to make out like it was
a bad thing to get smart!<G>

(2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    All peoples have stories of serpents many of
them have head cult legends where the skulls were used as resonators to
focus energy and to sing to the serpent to wake it up the aborigines
believe this as did the mayans and the cherokees and other native
peoples
(2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    ga
(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Thanks!! ok Trailstalker M'lady ga!
(2-1,Trailstalker)      Sorry... I'm coming in late on the conversa-
tion... 
                        are we talking about snake/kundalini power? 
                        ga
(2-8,O'Dubhain)         we are talking about the power in the Land
                        ga

3249

(2-1,Trailstalker)      ok I just needed a ref. pt. for the conversa-
tion.
(2-1,Trailstalker)      ga
(2-8,O'Dubhain)         ok Freepowder ga
(2-10,Freepowder)       The serpents are everywhere, but watch out! some
of 
                        them are snakes <G> couldn't resist, sorry <VBG>
          "The Many Speckled Rainment" "The Song of Amergin"
        
This translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work "Literary History of
Ireland" was as well known to the Druids as the "Lord's Prayer" is to
todays priests. It is a perfect example of the many different Magickal
skills used by the Druids. It is one of my personal favorites as
well!<G> I would like to use it to discuss the "many-speckled" rainbow
of Drai'ocht! Once again I give you the words of the Bard:
 
                                     The Mystery
 
                        I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                        I am the wave of the ocean.
                        I am the murmur of the billows.
                        I am the ox of the seven combats.
                        I am the vulture upon the
                        I am a beam of the Sun.
                        I am the fairest of plants.
                        I am a wild boar in valour.
                        I am a salmon in the water.
                        I am a lake in the plain.
                        I am a word of science.
                        I am a point of the lance in battle.
                        I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                        Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                        on the mountain?
                        Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                        Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
                                                        (If not I)"
 
Let's just go down the line and list the Druidic attributes used in this
one spell by lines and in order (I also assigned colors to each
attribute):
 
                             Attribute                       Color
                             _________________________________________
 
                             The Powers of: Wind,            (Red)
                                            Sea,             (Grey)
                                            Fire.            (White)
                             Persistence.                    (all)
                             Death in battle.                (Black)
                             The Power of the Sun.           (Golden)
                             The Power of the Green World.   (Green)

                             The resting place of the soul.  (Purple)
                             The Knowledge of Science.       (Yellow)
                             Focus through Discipline.       (White)

3250
               
I could write an entire page on each of these attributes but not
tonight!<G> "Fire in the Head" is the name of an excellent book by Tom
Cowan on the subject of Celtic Shamanism.  "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by
Douglas Monroe agrees with my assignments for most of the above colors. 
A true Druid worn the Cloak of many Colors for festive occassions, White
or Black robes to conduct Magick and during ritual and a bull's hide
when in battle.
 
                              "Authority"
 
This the source or result of working with Magick for Druids. It is a
measure of their Power and the strength of their "True Wills".  In the
"21 Lessons" Monroe states that the students of Drai'ocht were awarded
colored glass beads (called Gleini na Droedh) that were strung on
leather cords for necklaces. These multicolored necklaces were kept
secret by each Druid and produced only to demonstrate their Authority to
other Druids. Magick knowledge, discipline and practice determined the
level of Authority thus attained.
 
                           "Into the Light"
        
Fionn's Wheel can also be multicolored.  I have made the one in the
library that way!<G> (Make it so Number One!<G>) Seriously, to become a
Master Druid, one must transcend the separation of colors and walk into
the Light. This involves knowing the many fold paths of the Wheel and
primarily the Inner Mystery of the relationship of Life and Death, White
and Black, Balance and Action, Being and Not being. The Initiations into
most of the Great Mysteries included this Dualism of Transcendancy. (An
excellent  book on this topic is "The Great Initiates"by Edouard Schure,

                        What does this mean? 
                        What is this Initiation?
                        What is the Mystery?
 
 
What follows is what I envision COULD have happened during such an
initiation.  Hear the words a modern day Druid  might hear as he
achieves his full Knowledge:
 
<the Initiate will have been fasting and meditating within the total
darkness of a cave or a dark room for at least a night.  Just before the
rising of the sun or the lighting of the fires he/she would hear a loud
female voice cry out!>
 
     "I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Heavens!  You who approach me must
     now ask yourselves these questions: 
               How can you achieve the Inner Knowledge? 
          Where can you find the Signs that show you the Way? 
          Heed My Words! 
          I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Stars, 
          I am She of the Silver Wheel! 
          My crown spreads across the Vault of the Heavens! 
          Your dreams shall be filled with the Secret Ways of the Night! 
         It is I that will show you the Paths of Knowledge! 
          It is I that will fire your Spirit in sparkling crystals of
               Wonder! 
          I am Arianrhod! Come to Me My children!  
3251

          Be filled with Expectancy for what is yet to come!"
 
<The chief Druid could follow these words with the following caution.>
 
          "Hear the Words of the Ard Druis:"
          "You who seek the Ways of Power must dare to approach the
               Queen of the Stars! 
          You who seek the embrace of Wisdom must approach Her Presence
               without fear! 
          You that seek for Love must first know your True Selves. What 
         is your Authority?
          Are you truly Human? Speak now if you dare!"
 
<Then the Initiates should ask for entry to the Inner Mysteries.>
 
                        "Oh Arianrhod of the Silver Wheel! 
                        Bless us in Your Mysteries! 
                        Fill us with Your Spirit! 
                        Let us place no limits upon Your exalted Being! 
                        You are Infinite! 
                        You are the Unknown! The Darkness!
                        Admit us into Thy arms!
                        Grant us Your Blessings!
                        Our speech is confounded! 
                        Chaos is upon us!"
 
<Once again, the Ard Druis would charge the Initiates.>
 
                        "Now is the Great Re-awakening! 
                        Now is the time of enlightenment! 
                        Those who are untrue shall be cast out 
                        into the depths! 
                        Cleanse yourselves through trials of fire 
                        and fasting! The way is long, 
                        Only the strong shall attain Knowledge!"
 
<A flame or beam of sunlight should be produced to shine upon an open
doorway, admitting the Initiates into the Inner Sanctum.>
 
                        "Behold the Flaming Door!
                        Behold the Burning sword of Gorias!
                        Enter if you dare the halls of Lugh!!
                        Wear the many speckled cloak of Samildanach!"
                        "Hear the words of the Sun!"
 
<A male Druid dressed in Robes of Gold and bearing a torch should
address the Initiates.>
 
     "I am Lugh Lamfadagh!!! I am Samildanach!
     I am thy burning desire for Knowledge! 
     I am the Power that illumes the Heavens! 
     Life is my gift to you, even as your Death is the Mother of Life. 
     To know Me is to know yourself completely, even beyond Death!
     Enter if you dare!
     Approach the fires of Life!!!
     Die and live again!"
 
     "I, Lugh am the focus of the Power and you My Druid are its     
3252

Manifestation!
     Enter the Flaming Door!
          Cead Mile Failte! 
          Maith an Drui!" 
 
<At this point the Initiate should be robed in the multispeckled robe
and presented with a golden sickle and a staff fashioned from the wood
of the tree that is his "soul tone".  Standing before the gathered
assembly,He should recite his geneology and the many achievements of his
necklace of Gleini na Droedh. The ceremony should then be completed by
the conducting of the Initiate's personal ritual (from his work on the
Red Level).>
 
                        Such is the end of a long journey.
                        An Fhi'rinne Roimh an Saol!
                        We must awaken the Dragon Power within us all!!
                        DRAI'OCHT LIVES AGAIN!
                        TA' ME' DRAI'OCHT!!

Celtic Workshop #13 - The "Charm of Making" 

This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
some concepts touching upon the beginings of all things. We also covered
how symbols are used to describe reality and Magick. We discussed the
necessity for *belief* in performing Magick. I led a discussion about a
ritual that was centered around the Charm of "Making". The arch[e]types
and the Quarters used in Celtic Magickal systems were also discussed.
Some preliminary socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation
and discussion:

                            Opening Remarks
 
Tonight I attempt to tie together the beliefs of the Celts in Cos-
mologies and Magick or Drai'ocht to what we know of the world and
reality through the study of modern science and more recent Magickal
systems and their resulting Cosmological models. It is my hope that all
of this discussion will clarify the history of the Celts and the
workings of the Druids. The highest form of Drai'ocht was the Charm of
"Making". This is the essence of creation by the use of the Will.  It is
into the Cauldron of Primodial Creation that I plunge tonight as a
Midwife to Magick.  Drai'ocht shall live again! The Dragon will once
again be reborn!
 
                                "Chaos"
 
In many mythologies and some philosophies, Chaos is the void that
existed in the begining of all things before even time existed and from 
which all things have arisen. 
 
"The notion that creation came from nothing (creatio ex nihilo) appears
in several accounts of creation. The biblical story of creation
contained in the Book of GENESIS begins with a formless, watery chaos
that God shapes into the ordered world. The hymn of creation from
India's epic Rig Veda (see VEDAS) describes the primordial situation as
one of neither existence nor nonexistence and further states that no
one, not even the gods, knows who produced the universe. In marked
contrast is an Egyptian myth attributing creation to the deity khepri.
In this myth Khepri states that when he came into being, being itself
3253

came into being; all other beings were then produced from his actions
and his body; but before him there was only nonbeing. Among the
Polynesians, creation myths emphasize the dimensions of void space and
the qualities of darkness as the primordial structures of creation. In
these myths, the initial state of darkness and void in which the deity
dwells is later transformed and the forms of the universe then emerge.
Creation is thus predicated on a void or a nothingness--a reality
totally different from any form or substance of the created order. In
addition, the deities who create from nothing or emerge from this void
are given a new and special kind of power; for though creators of the
world, they remain distinct from it in their originative form."
.......quoted from The Online Edition of GROLIER'S ACADEMIC AMERICAN
Encyclopedia, Copyright (c) 1993, Grolier Electronic Publishing.
 
Magick is the ability to cross the void of Chaos and to create order in
the universe that surrounds us. The primary way in which this creation
occurs is through the focus of our own Wills.
 
                      "The Void was without Form"
        
"Chaos theory, a modern development in mathematics and science, provides
a framework for understanding irregular or erratic fluctuations in
nature. Chaotic systems are found in many fields of science  and
engineering. The study of their dynamics is an essential part of the
burgeoning science of complexity--the effort to understand the prin-
ciples of order that underlie the patterns of all real systems, from
ecosystems to social systems to the universe as a whole." ..quoted from

The BIG BANG theory of the creation of the universe is widely accepted
by astronomers.  "It holds that the universe began with the explosive
expansion of a single, extremely condensed state of matter. A further
development of this model, known as INFLATIONARY THEORY, describes the
original condensed matter as arising from virtually empty space. Whether
the universe will expand forever, slow to a halt, or contract again and
continue to oscillate indefinitely from one big bang to the next is the
subject of ongoing speculation....." Charles Long .......quoted from The

                                "Order"
 
Out of Nothingness was Reality formed. The diversity of Reality is due
to the two great forces of separation: projection and reception (the
male and the femine aspects of Power).  From this duality of all things,
the rest of Creation is manifested. This manifestation can be described
and modeled in many ways. I have chosen to limit myself briefly to two
such descriptions during tonight's workshop. The first such model or
description is the science of "quantum mechanics". According to this
area of science, everything is composed of waves and the interaction
between wavefronts. With two primary and distinctly different sources of
waveforms, we get interference patterns. These lines of intersection
have their own "nature" and give rise to other "quantum effects" in
their own localized area of the space/time continuum. This ongoing
process of interaction and manifestation can create Infinite Combination
in Infinite Diversity (IDIC). I will discuss this concept later.
3254
 
The other way in which two differing states can create their own
"reality" is through the laws of Boolean Logic and Algebra. In digital
design and simulation techniques, this fact is well known. I work in
such areas and can reduce any system to a series of "min" and "max"
terms of inputs and "truth tables". This Boolean discipline of using
"min and max terms" has given birth to the CyberSpace that we currently
inhabit. I suggest that our present existence is no more than a
"real-time" simulation in a greater system and that our creative/destru-
ctive interactions are constantly birthing new realities and new
creations. We are each a "star" as some Magickal systems teach. 
 
All Physical and Magickal systems have hidden controls that operate from
outside the program flow (another word for this flow might be called
"life"). This outside intervention might be what appears in the form of
"Magick" to an internal observer of that system. The operating system
for the host platform, such as DOS, determines the form of the relation-
ships between all programs, files and other processes. A magickal way of
stating this might be, "As Above, So Below".  Tonight, I have discussed
only two ways that some realities are postulated and created. In the
wide variety of the Infinite Cosmos, Diversity is carried to the
extremes. Anything CAN and DOES happen!
 
                               "Symbols"
 
One way man has attempted to understand and quantify his universe is
through the use of symbols. The most often used symbols are numbers,
letters and sigils. The Jewish Kabbala, the Celtic Oghams and the other
Magickal alphabets are good examples of the use of such symbols to order
and understand most physical, spiritual and Magickal relationships. I
have talked about Oghams and Fionn's Wheel/Ladder in previous workshops.
I have also talked about the Celtic Cosmology. Tonight I will briefly
touch on numbers and math. Please refer to the previous Celtic Workshops
#1, 2, 3, 5 and the Online Wicca Kabbala Threads for more information in
those areas. Another kind of symbol that can describe our reality is a
relatively new form of mathematics called Fractals.
 
                              "Fractals"
 
"A modern mathematical theory that radically departs from traditional
EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY, fractal geometry describes objects that are
self-similar, or scale symmetric.  This means that when such objects are
magnified, their parts are seen to bear an exact resemblance to the
whole, the likeness continuing with the parts of the parts and so on to
infinity.  Fractals, as these shapes are called, also must be devoid of
translational symmetry--that is, the smoothness associated with
Euclidean lines, planes, and spheres.  Instead a rough, jagged quality
is maintained at every scale at which an object can be examined.  The
nature of fractals is reflected in the word itself, coined by mathe-
matician Benoit B. Mandelbrot from the Latin verb frangere, "to break," 
and the related adjective fractus, "irregular and fragmented."
 
The science of fractals has been found to exist within many natural
formations . Fractals are found everywhere we look, from the shape of 
coastlines to the geometry found in cellular divisions. Most dynamical
systems that change their behavior over time become CHAOTIC in nature
and can also be described using fractals.  The reason I mention fractals
tonight is twofold. First, fractals show us mathematically how reality
and life are manifested. As I said earlier, fractal geometry and 
3255

mathematics are a fairly recent discovery. One important type of Fractal
that is found in nature is called a Mandelbrot set. This particular set
of fractals becomes inheritly unstable as one looks closer at it's
component fractals. What is so interesting about this fact and study is
that FRACTALS in the FORM OF MANDELBROT SETS have been appearing as CROP
CIRCLES on the Salisbury Plains. This is the same area that is located
close by both Stonehenge and Avebury.  What is the source of these
symbols? Where is this information coming from? Are these crop circles
some sort of Magickal alphabet or symbols? Are they communicated to us
across time and space from other Magicians or other Entities? If they
are such symbols, has this phenomena occurred before in the past? Did
the Druids observe, record and understand this type of information
during their times? 
 
My second pointis that our knowledge of Magick is itself like a fractal.
With each piece of information we receive from our searches into the
nature of Magick, we discover more and more questions. This gives rise
to more and more associations and consequently more questions and
disorder. Our attempts to totally understand Magick by close inspection 
consequently results in chaotic thinking.  We see fractals everywhere
when we look at the world. This world seems to be a fractal.  Everything
from shorelines, earthquakes, cell structure to computer graphics have
been found to obey the laws of fractals. Perhaps Magick and the heavenly
cosmologies are fractals of the Higher Will? Perhaps our True Will is a
fractal? Maybe fractals are the new Ogham, the new Wheel of Fionn?
        
                           "Transformations"
 
If an idea can be reduced to mathematical or Magickal symbols, then it
can also be manipulated or transformed. These relation-ships are called
"veils" or "pathworkings" in Magickal works. In mathematics, such
transformations occur frequently. What is complex in one domain is
simple in another.  Engineers use such techniques as vector and
tensor analysis to handle complex systems all the time. Magicians use
the principle, "As Above , So Below" to aid their Magickal Workings.
Sometimes this Magickal work is also done while using symbollic logic to
aid in the act of manifesting or "making" a new creation. We will next
discuss how some of these Magickal transformations are done.
        
                          "Vibratory States"
 
The addition of external energy to a molecule or the introduction of
additional molecules into a solution causes its electron configuartion
to change. The electron "jumps" across an energy barrier to obtain a
different orbit or geometry.  The Molecule changes its behavior,
sometimes with amazing results. This change in electrons through levels
or states of energy is directly analogous to the levels or states of
vibration that a Magician goes through to "resonate" with other
spiritual forces. These principles of resonance and vibration are the
keys to the techniques of OOBE and energy transfer in Magickal systems.
To discover how we as Magickal/Spiritual entities can go through these
types of transformed states, I looked at my own experiences, once again.
 
                        "Personal Experiences"
 
The keys to working Magick are BELIEF, DISCIPLINE and FOCUS. Focus is a
matter of personal ability and is sharpened through practice and effort. 
Discipline is inherit to our very natures. Belief is absolutely 
3256

necessary to any Magickal Work. I have had three types of personal
experiences that are the foundation of my BELIEF in MAGICK.
 
                        "The All from the None"
 
This experience I have discussed before. It is the first veil that must
be passed to obtain BELIEF in Magick and the resulting Powers. Briefly
stated, I was able to detach from the ordinary (while conscious) and
encounter Spirit and Magickal Beings.  These experiences have reinforced
my ability to work Astrally and Magickally. The secrets to this
experience are meditation, inner quietness and the increased vibrational
level of the spirit or "ecstasy".
 
By going into the "void" of Nothingness, I was touched by the Power of
the Akasha! Anyone can do this, if they are willing to put in the time
and effort to meditate to achieve inner "quietness".  The "Void" is the
place where the Will can focus to create and produce all Magick!
 
                        "The None From the All"
 
These are experiences I have had from "lucid dreaming". I have basically
been able to go anywhere and do anything in my dreams. I have had many
revelations and Super Normal experiences in these dreams. I guess the
most outrageous experience was experiencing "death". Some deaths were
just an abrupt end to one existence while manifesting into another body
and another existence. One particular "death" was at the center of an
exploding sun or bomb. I was literally blown into Nothingness and
Non-Existence. I "floated" there in endless time without thought or
being. I just was.  Only my Will still existed and through the exertion
of my Will I was able to awaken into my body once more. This was not and
ordinary dream. In fact, I'm not really sure this is the Reality I
started out in! <GGG>  A Powerful incentive to learn more about Magick
(to prevent such a thing from ever happening again)!!!!!
 
                                "IDIC"
 
IDIC is borrowed from the Vulcan, Mr. Spock. It stands for Infinite
Diversity in Infinite Combinations. This basically means the Universe
is filled with possibilities and that anything can (and will) happen.
This is all those strange events that can be dismissed if taken one at
a time but will stagger you if you keep a log of them. This includes
such things in my life as:  Flying or "floating" in the air by myself, 
reading minds, seeing the future, seeing creatures that are in another
plane, hearing the music of the Sidhe and incredible feats of strength
and speed (that could not possible have happened). All these many events
taken together point to a variety of techniques that people can do. The
secret is in remembering how we did it!!! Or maybe in finding a really
excellent teacher. I am the worst of students but I am very persis-
tent!<GGG>
 
                         "The Charm of Making"
 
The following is the merest sketch of an outline for performming the
Charm of Making, the very same chant that Merlin was heard to use in the
movie "Excalibur". Much of this ritual comes from the following works:
"The 21 Lessons of Merlin", "Celtic Magic', "Witta", "The Irish Celtic
Magical Tradition" and the "Sacred Cauldon". Some of it is changed to
suit my personal (*Irish*) preferences!<G>
3257
 
                        "Circles of Drai'ocht "
 
Druids' Circles are very similar to other Magickal Circles. Each
direction should have a candle and color associated with it.  (I use Red
for East, White for South, Grey or Blue for West and Black for North).
I also have candles for the God and the Goddess.  these are usually
Green and Red respectively.  I light the candles as the Spirits are
invoked.
 
                            "The Guardians"
 
                                 "Air"

Deity for its elemental Powers or Nymphs and Undines is Niksas, ruler of
the depths of the Sea and the spirits of the waters. This direction is
most often associated with Emotions, healing and Marriage. Ritual work
for this direction is associated with Fall, sunset, plants, the
subconscious mind and dreams.  A suitable invocation of the Guardians 
might be:
                        "Tugaim cuireadh do Garda de Siar!

The Guardian of the North Quarter is Morfessa, associated with the Power
of Earth. The sacred city of this Spiritual realm is Falias. The Celtic
Deities usually associated with this Quarter are the Morrigan and the
Dagdha. The sacred treasure or weapon is the Stone of Fal.  The Magickal
Deity for the elemental Powers or Gnomes and Dwarfs is Ghobas,ruler of
the  inhabitants of the Earth and a crystal spirits.   This direction is
most often associated with Destiny, Prosperity and Fate as well as
Magick.  Ritual work for this direction is associated with Winter,
night, midnight, self will and treasures.  A suitable invocation of the
Guardians might be:
                        "Tugaim cuireadh do Garda de O'Thuaigh!
                         Tugaim cuireadh do Duile de Talamh is Cloch!

The Center of the Circle is protected by the Power of the God and the
Goddess and the balance and diversity that They each manifest and
control. This is the province of the Goddess of Sovereignty, Macha, and
the Horned God or the Hunter, Samhan. The center is protected by the
combined Powers of the Quarters and their Masters.  A suitable invo-

                             "The Words of Power"
 
After the Guardians have been called, then the Words of Power Are Spoken
and the Rite or Sign of Three Rays is performed for each of the
Quarters.
 
                                        "IAO"
 
This is the name of the God/dess of All and is intoned three times while
making the appropriate hand gestures,
 
                                "EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO".
                                "EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO".

                                "Threshold Experiences"
 
If a portal to another plane or place is to be opened then the following
Charm of Making is to be said three times (this Charm uses the Power of
Sea and Stone):
 
                              "A ELFNTODD DWYR SINDDYN DUW
                               CERRIG YR FFERLLURUG NWYN;
                               OS SYRIAETH ECH SAFFAER TU

                                                   "Dragon's Breath"
 
If something is to be caused to happen or prevented then the following
Charm of Making is intoned three times (this charm invokes the Powers of
Fire and Air):
 
                                    "ANAIL NATHROCK
                                     UTHVASS BETHUDD
                                     DOCHIEL DIENVE"
 
At this point the Power has been raised. The Will of the Draoi' should
be directed and stated forcefully in the direction of greatest Power
using the sign for that Quarter. Once the work, is completed, the
God/desses and Guardians should be thanked and the Power Earthed by 
lowering both hands to the ground while kneeling.  The Circle is opened
in the reverse of its creation and the bounty of the Land and Tuatha
should be enjoined and enjoyed by all.
 
This is the end of the prepared presentation on the Charm of "Making".
This and "Pathworking" are the two most powerful abilities of a Druid.

       Celtic Workshop #14 - "The Wheel of Elements or Seasons"

Forum member Freepowder noted similarities between the Plains Indian
Medicine Wheels and Fionn's Wheel from Celtics sources. His analysis and
presentation on these topics led into a discussion of other cross 
3261

cultural similarities. I added some info from a study of the indigenous
peoples of the world as well as Celtic topics. 

Tonight our man of many names, Freepowder, O'Ba'n,John White, Sir Freep,
etc. will give us his thoughts on the wheel and the directions as
compared between the Plains Indians and the Celts.  It looks to be
good!<GGG> I may have a few comments of my own. I also have some info on
thses directions compiled by a noted anthropologist, Angeles Arriens,
for the indiginous peoples of the world. I hope we can discuss the use
and meanings of directions to all of us in our magical work.
 
                                    "The Wheel of Elements or Seasons"
 
The world over, aboriginal religions have used the circle as a symbol of
the world, the cosmos and the spirit.  Tonite I will attempt to draw
some parallels between the Celtic version, Fionn's wheel or window and
the Plains Indian version, the Medicine wheel.  Both of these wheels are
pictured as a circle bisected by two lines, one vertical and one
horizontal. In Plains Indian (PI from here on) the circle represents the
cycles of the earth, of learning and of life. 
 
The lines represent the 'roads' one must travel to achieve enlighten-
ment.  The points at which the lines intersect the circle signify the
four directions, east to the right, south at the bottom, west to the
left, and north at the top.  There are qualities and totems (animal
spirit guides) assigned to each direction. The totems and qualities
vary somewhat, tribe to tribe, and the following is an attempt to
combine several, mostly Lakota (Sioux) and Tsisistis (Cheyenne)   .
 
                                    East: 
red, illunination, child, the sun, spring, the source of life, 
eagle, hawk and birds generally

                        South: 
yellow, innocence, youth, daylight, summer, fullness of life, snake,
lizard, mouse, horse, elk

                        West: 
black or blue, introspection, maturity, sunset, autumn, waning of life,
thunder beings, Bear, buffalo

                        North: 
white, wisdom, old age, night, winter, death, wolf, raven, buffalo
 
The PI speak of the guardians of the quarters as 'Grandfathers' or
'Grandmothers'. Animals in mundane life are refered to as 'Little
Brother or Sister.' At the center of the wheel is,in Lakota, 'Wakan
Tanka', the Great Mystery. The source of all life, of all that is.
Although Wakan Tanka is refered to as Grandfather, it has no sex, no
body, it is at once the creator and all of creation. Also at the center
is White Buffalo woman (or Sweet Medicine to the Cheyenne), the
personification of the earth, and the female aspect of Wakan Tanka.
 
The cycle of life as illustrated by the Medicine Wheel starts at the
east. The PI believe that as an infant a person knows all things, thus
the connection with enlightenment. As you grow into youth these things
are forgotten so you may learn, and grow, symbolised by the south and
innocence. When you are mature you move to the west and introspection. 
3262

Here you take your vision quest. As you approach old age you achieve
wisdom in the north and, if you survive you return to the enlightenment
of the east.
                        On to the Celts!
 
The Celts use either a four spoked wheel, identical to the medicine
wheel in apearance or enhance the image with 'cross quarters' making an
eight spoked wheel. One differnce in the Celtic version of the Wheel, is
probaly due to the variation in weather patterns between the Britsh
Isles and the Great Plains. The Britsh Isles are around 1000 miles north
of the Plains causing several things to happen. The sun, even at
midsummer will rise far further to the north in Britain. Britain's
proximity to the trade winds cause the prevailing winds to come from
differnt directions. Therefore the Celts start their journey of life in
the north.  The qualities of the quarters areremarkably similar if
somewhat skewed as to direction. (Note: the animals assigned to quarters
and cross quarters are approximate and individual impressions as to what
animal goes where are most important IMHO)   
 
                                    They are:
 
                        North: 
black, winter, wisdom, clarity, death, earth, animals, minerals,
fallowness, darkness, winter solstice, salmon, wolf, the Morrigan, 

                        East: 
red, spring, inspiration, life, birth, renewal, air, birds, smell,
dryness, germination, spring equinox, otter, crow

                        South: 
white, summer, spirit, humanity, change, power, fire, sun, light,
vegatables, summer solstice, bear, hawk,

                        West:  
grey, autumn, creativity, ripeness, fertility, compassion, love,
emotions, hearing, water, moon, twilight, fish, autumn equinox, stag,
hound
 
The cross quarters mark the seasonal festivals, have associated animals
and are used to represent the ages of mankind:
        
                                Imbolc: 31 Jan, child, eagle
                                Beltaine: 30 Apr, youth, sow
                                Lughnasadh: 31 Jul, adult, horse
                                Samhain: 31 Oct, elder, heron
 
The Celts assign Gods and Goddesses to the quarters as well. The
following courtesy of O'Dubh, and subject to interpretation. God/esses
are directional <G> as follows:
 
                        North: 
Master Morfessa of Falias, The Morrighan, Goibhniu, The Dagdha, Epona,
Eriu, Macha (The Land, the Lia Fal, Magick, Soveriegnty)   

                        East: 
Master Uscias of Findias Danu, Anu, Lir, Lugh, Bridget, Scathach, Ogma,
Nuada (The Invincible Sword, Wisdom, Strength, the Winds)   
                        South: 
3263

Master Esras from Gorias The Dagdha, Lugh, Bridget, Danu (The Flaming
Spear, Action, Fire, the Sun or Shining One)   

                        West: 
Master Semias from Murias, Manannan mac Lir, The Dagdha, The Cailleach,
Cerridwen, Danu, Dianecht, Arianrhod (Rebirth, the Undry, the Sacred
Cauldron, the Sea, Water)   
 
Many of these God/desses are assigned to more than one direction because
they have more than one aspect (The Dagdha, Danu, Bridget, Lugh, the
Morrighan). The best way to associate them with a particular direction
is to base their direction upon their role in your Working or upon their
use of the magickal tool involved.
 
The Celts have this multi-faceted diversity in the nature and directions
of their God/desses due to their travels across Europe and their
incorporation of the local Deities into the Deities of their respective
clans.  When they finally stopped their travels, these Deities were then
more fixed in their associated directions and attributes. As modern day
Celts, we have the use of all of these Archetypes to aid or worship and
to enrich our Magicks!

(2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee say that all ancient cultures
descend through the plieades and that the druids and the cherokee have
origins in atlantis the cherokee calendar as are most medicine wheels
are based on the mayan system of time.  The Dogon of W. Africa say the
same.  which is very similar to the celtic most ancient cultures say
they got the wheel from the stars

Also some of the first sailors to come in contact with North American
Indians were Welsh and they could converse with some of the tribes!
Seemed the Indians were speaking Welsh!<G>

(2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee also claim twelve tribes came out
of atlantis when it was destroyed and populated the areas of the earth
bringing this ancient wisdom to other cultures like the 12 tribes of
israel there are 12 clans in the cherokee matrilieage.  There was
contact betwweeen the nordic vikings and the indians after contact with
the celts too.

(2-9,M&J)               As to the NA Indians speaking Welsh, I attended
a Celtic League symposium a year or two back, and this was one of the
talks.  I'll have to go back and review my notes, but as I recall this
is heavily debated.  The accounts go back to a Welsh prince who
supposedly sailed to America.  Whether or not this is true is highly
uncertain.

(2-8,Freepowder)        The Welsh Prince was Madoc, and I believe...
he was supposed to have sailed in the 11th century.... there were
records of his sailing away.... but nothing on where he ended up....he
most certainly never returned to wales.... One possible explanation for
the 'Welsh' Indians is the occurance of grey eyes in some of the
southern tribes, notably... the Choctaw and Cherokee.... There are some
similarities in the languages, but it is possible.. that this is due to
some wandering Celt .... heading east from the orient. <G>

Ok Thanks FP!<G>  There are many other similarities...notably the common
belief among both sets of peoples, the Cherokees and the Celts, that
3264

springs were doorways to the Underworlds and possessed their own
spirits. There are other similarities... The Irish have legends about
the first settlers coming from the west after a flood.

 This was later Christianized to be the daughter of Noah Ceasir....but
it was first thought to be Atlantis. Also some of the alignments of the
stone circles are on the Pleides.  In fact, The two major hubs of the
Celtic year are connected to when the Pleides first ascend into the
constellation of Taurus That is when Bealtaine and Samhain actually
occur.
 
As to use in your magickal workings, given the eclectic nature of most
American Mages, introduction of the Plains Indian version of the
attributes of the quarters is allowable. Perhaps even justified given
our geographical location. I personally use the Indian colors and
animals in conjunction with the Celtic God/esses. As they used to say in
the Toyota comercials, 'It just feels right.' <G>

Ok I have another set of values for directions.  Then a brief discussion
of future topics.  I know everyone is suffering from too much Holiday!!-
!<GGG>

Here's my blurb on directions:  The "Four Fold Way" by  Angeles Arrien
a survey of sacred directions and paths of the indigenous peoples of the
world gives the following characteristics to the directions:
 
                        North:
The Way of the Warrior, Direction of Power, Element is Air, winged
creatures, Standing Meditations, Right Actions, Dancing, instrumrnt is
the rattle and season is the Winter.
 
                        East:
The Way of the Visionary, Direction of Vision, Element is Fire, dessert
and no legged creatures, Walking meditations, Truth telling, Singing,
instrument is the bell and season is Summer.
 
                        South:
The Way of the Healer, Direction of Love, Element of Earth, All four
legged creatures, Meditating while laying down, Right Speech is the way
of living, Paying attention, Story telling, instrument is the drum and
the season is Spring.
 
                        West:
The Way of the Teacher, Direction of Wisdom, Element of Water, All Water
creatures,Sitting meditations,RightTiming in life's actions, Being Open
minded to outcomes, Silence is the best wisdom, instruments are sticks
and bones and season is Autumn.

               "HOW TO USE MAGICK with a Straight Face"

             "People that eat blowfish are stupid. 
        People that do not eat blowfish are also stupid."
                                        --Japanese proverb


   With  the advent of the New Age,  many people are airing great 
new  ways  to change your life for the better.  These  ideas  are 
based  on the premise that we have total control of our lives  on 
some level.  All we need do is reach that level with our desires. 
This is,  of course,  the big challenge. You can read millions of 
words on that subject.  Why is there so much information? Because 
achieving this kind of control is a very individual thing.  There 
are  so many different ways that each person could write his  own 
book.  To succeed,  each must find his own path. The reason there 
are  instructions  at  all,  though,  is because  each  can  find 
guidance in the successes of others.  Magick is one of these many 
guides.
    
   This  file is relatively short because it concentrates less on 
the  myriad  details of magick and more on how to find  your  own 
path.  The  task  is never as easy as it sounds,  but it  is  not 
complex,  either.  With straight forward exercises (good,  honest 
work on your Self) you will achieve whatever you desire.  We  all 
have  this  power.  The  way we use it is not by  gaining  a  new 
ability,  but by getting out of the way of the ability we already 
have. This book outlines the basic blocks and the kinds of things 
to  do about them.  But,  as with any advice,  it is up to you to 
honestly  assess your own situation and discover what works  best 
for you.  Remember,  achieving your personal Power is  everyone's 
path  in life.  You will succeed,  it is only a question of when. 
This  book  is designed to bring that success more  quickly  and, 
overall, more easily.

   Many  people  these  days still appeal  to  the  "booga-booga" 
aspect of magick:  "We will grant you incredible powers to use on 
whomever  you please if you send us money." As we enter into  the 
New Age of understanding,  people are learning that occult powers 
are actually a natural part of everyone's life. It is our goal to 
help  this process along.  We hope to teach newcomers what magick 
is about.  This book is written not only to inform,  but also  to 
circumvent  the  psychological  barriers set up by  living  in  a 
mechanistic society. The mechanistic paradigm (the idea that each 
person  and  object  is  totally separate from the  rest  of  the 
universe  except through physical interaction)  precludes  magick
(non-physically   affecting  one's  environment).   The  magickal 
paradigm  states  that your beliefs  create  your  reality.  This 
choice  is like contemplating eating blowfish-- when  you analyze 
it,  you  can  conclude that adopting either paradigm is  stupid. 
Since you can't please everyone else,  pick the one that you like 
best. If (and only if) the magickal paradigm appeals to you, then 
choose it. Then the trick is to get out of the mind-set that says 
that  magick  is  impossible.  We hope that  you  will  try  some 
exercises  to prove to yourself that magick works.  Once you have 
3266

done  so,  then  you  are on the way to  achieving  anything  you 
desire.
                       
                              POWER

   Power can be a very misleading term.  The way most people mean 
it is in the sense of "power-over." People recognize power as the 
ability to get others to do what you want,  especially when these 
others  have different ideas.  This is not Power (with a  capital 
'P')  at all.  When you rely on someone else to do something  for 
you,  you  give  your Power to him.  This is very different  from 
doing something *with* someone,  then both parties gain.  But, to 
believe  that you must force or trick another is to say that  you 
need this person to do something that you cannot.  You may  steal 
their power (lower case) but you give away your Power. 

   Power  is,  among  other things,  the innate ability to  bring 
whatever you truly desire into your life.  When you "make" others 
manifest them for you,  you create blocks in your own mind. These 
blocks say "I cannot do this myself," which obstructs your Power. 
This is "giving away your Power." 

   When you "take your Power," you accept responsibility for your 
life.  This  is not guilt or martyrdom,  it is honestly assessing 
your  life  and recognizing your  successes  and  failures.  Give 
yourself  credit for even the smallest success and recognize that 
you  can overcome every obstacle.  Then you allow your  Power  to 
express  itself.  What you need comes to you;  projects work  for 
you.

   We  often  think  of many  obstacles  as  insurmountable.  For 
instance,  many  believe  the lottery to be their only  desperate 
hope of escaping poverty.  Such people give away their Power. And 
why  shouldn't they?  Everything they've experienced  tells  them 
this.  Our  whole  society is rooted in the mechanistic  paradigm 
(all causes and effects have a physical link),  which precludes a 
belief in Power.  How is one to know that this concept works? How 
can  this be real when it is so different from what we  are  used 
to?

   Our  society  has  a  concept of  "Reality"  as  an  objective 
existence  of  which  we are all a part.  When  two  people  have 
different  ideas of the nature of some detail,  then at least one 
is Wrong. We all have a fear of being Wrong. When we are Wrong we 
miss out on things and people don't like us as much. Therefore we 
desperately strive to be Right.  It turns out that Right is  what 
ever  those around you happen to feel that it should be.  It's as 
if  they  all  took a vote when you were out  of  the  room.  But 
"Right" changes all the time: from preservatives are harmless, to 
preservatives  cause cancer;  from Stalin is a great  leader,  to 
Stalin  was a monster;  from Ptolemy explains the forces  of  the 
universe perfectly, to Newton explains the forces of the universe 
perfectly,  to  Einstein  explains  the forces  of  the  universe 
perfectly.  The  philosophy  of science this calls this  evolving 
better  (or at least different) explanations.  Yet,  while  these 
ideas hold sway, people call them "Reality."

   Just how reliable is Reality?  We all live our lives using our 
3267

individual concepts of Reality to get along. We update them as we 
see fit. But few will fundamentally change their concepts. We are 
sure  that,  although we may not have the details,  we  certainly 
have  a  feel  for  the basics.  Anyone who  disagrees  with  the 
mechanistic paradigm,  for instance,  must be missing at least  a 
few  marbles.  Such a person is irrational in a universe that  we 
know to be rational.

   But  is the universe truly rational?  Science has pursued the 
mechanistic  paradigm  down  to  the  smallest  scale,   particle 
physics;  here  it fails to explain the  universe.  The  building 
blocks  of Reality do not behave rationally.  If you drive a  car 
from one side of a mountain to the other and you have a choice of 
two  tunnels,  you  will drive through one of them.  If a  single 
electron has a choice of two holes in a plate to pass through, it 
will go through both. You can plot the speed and position of your 
car  to the limit of the accuracy of your  instruments,  but  you 
will never be able to do both to that electron. 

   When you observe this mythical car,  it is a solid object.  If 
it were not,  it would not be a car. If you drove it around, then 
tested  to  see if the car were not solid and discovered that  it 
wasn't,  what  would you think?  Around the turn of the  century, 
scientists figured out that light acts like a wave when you  test 
for a wave,  and like a particle when you test for a particle. In the 
regular world it must be one *or* the other.  The two are as 
mutually exclusive as a non-solid car that you can none the  less 
drive.  Mysteriously,  light was behaving like both.  Eventually, 
scientists concluded that light doesn't work like the universe we 
are  used to.  The act of observing light defines its  character. 
This  is  called  wave-particle duality.  Later in  the  century, 
scientists  found that atomic particles,  the building blocks  of 
all matter, behave this way, too.

   Now  imagine  that  you  can find no evidence  that  this  car 
crosses  the space between where you see it and where you saw  it 
last.  Suppose  the  car isn't actually "there" when  you're  not 
looking--  the  act of looking brings it  into  "existence." What 
would you think if noticed that your expectations seem to have an 
effect on where it turns out to be?  This is awfully strange, but 
it  is  the  kind  of universe  that  particle  physicists  find. 
"Looking  at"  a subatomic particle "brings it  into  existence." 
Also,  scientists are finding that whatever kind of particle they 
expect  to  find in an experiment,  tends to be  there.  This  is 
starting  to  look less like brilliant theory and  more  like  an 
effect  of the observers.  They are no longer separate from their 
experiments. It turns out that the universe doesn't actually work 
the way we've always assumed it does.

   This  is  the nature of matter on the smallest scale,  and  it 
doesn't make sense in every day life.  This does not mean that we 
should abandon our present ideas of how to live.  Keep what works 
("If  it  ain't broke,  don't fix it").  Particle  physics  won't 
affect how you drive through tunnels,  for instance.  But, if you 
accept  physics,  the epitome of the mechanistic  paradigm,  this 
means  that our mechanistic ideas of how the universe  works  are 
fundamentally  incomplete.   In  other  words,   the  mechanistic 
paradigm is not the whole story. 
3268

   Big deal.  What does this mean in a practical sense? The world 
seems  to  work  just  the same as it did  when  the  mechanistic 
paradigm was unchallenged. But what if our preconceptions dictate 
what we are aware of?  It is a common trick to set up a group  of 
people  for  startling  event and see how many  will  overlook  a 
strange inconsistency.  In one instance, a teacher took a student 
off  into an adjoining room on a pretext.  There was the sound of 
an argument and a crash and the student ran out through the room. 
One of the other students suspected a set up and she was the only 
one  who  noticed that the teacher's accomplice  was  carrying  a 
bone.  A much more dramatic example is the story of Magellan's ships. 
When the explorer landed on a particular island, the natives, who 
had never seen europeans before, recognized them as funny looking 
men  in funny looking little boats.  But Magellan soon found that 
the  natives  were unaware of the large ships that  carried  them 
there,  though they were impossible to overlook.  The natives had 
seen men and small boats before,  but they had never seen a large 
ship.  Such a thing was outside of their experience and therefore 
outside  of their comprehension.  Their eyes must have  seen  the 
ships,  but their brains did not.  The natives gathered to try to 
see them, staring intently at where they supposed to be anchored. 
Soon  the local shaman could discern the barest outline which  he 
described  to  the  others.  Eventually they could  all  perceive 
ships.
   
   Who  can  say what we make ourselves unaware of?  It  is  only 
after  we've expanded our perception that we learn how limited it 
was  before.  But we can't go around indiscriminately  "expanding 
our  consciousness."  What we choose to believe is based  on  our 
desires. If you are happy with what you believe, the is no reason 
to  change.  "If  it  ain't  broke,  don't  fix  it."  Change  is 
challenging and even if you succeed,  it may well be  unpleasant. 
But  if  you feel unable to overcome obstacles in your life  (and 
you *really*  want to),  then you have nothing to  loose.  Magick 
will only expand possibilities.  If it's all a crock, you've lost 
nothing. If it's true, you can do anything you're willing to work 
for.  It is a draw-win situation. The only way you can lose is to 
make  your choice out of fear.  Don't let the opinions of  others 
influence what you choose to believe. Don't give away your Power. 
Everyone else is in the same situation you are,  so when it comes 
to your own life, there is no greater authority than yourself. If 
you're  interested in magick,  try it and see for yourself if  it 
works for you.

                         WHAT MAGICK IS

Magick is a way of using your Power.  More technically, magick is 
the  process of non-physically affecting your environment through 
messages consciously impressed on the subconscious with a  system 
of symbols.  (This will become clear later.) This is the broadest 
definition and it can include such things as prayer,  meditation, 
chanting,  positive thinking,  subliminal tapes,  programming and 
hypnotism.

Some think that magick is unnatural and evil.  It is no more evil 
than  any  tool.  A  knife,  for instance,  is "good"  or  "evil" 
depending  on its use.  It can be invaluable in  many  beneficial 
projects,  yet  it  can also harm.  Nothing is immune to  misuse. 
People even try to use prayer against others.  Such potential  is 
not a reason for fear,  but for respect.  The idea that magick is 
unnatural is a modern misconception. Magic has only recently come 
to  mean Hollywood special effects or pulling rabbits from  hats. 
It  is often spelled magick in order to distinguish it from  this 
new   meaning.   For   millennia  magick  has  been  a  path   to 
enlightenment  and  self mastery or just plain getting  what  you 
want.  It is nothing supernatural. Magick uses natural powers and 
the  natural flow of the universe to bring about the changes  you 
desire. We are so immersed in magick that, like still air, we are 
unaware  of  it.  We all use this  power  without  thought,  like 
breathing. Magick is using these powers with awareness.

Magick  involves  placing  a message of your choosing  into  your 
subconscious.  This is all that is necessary to achieve any goal. 
The power of the subconscious is awesome.  When you unite it with 
your  conscious will,  you can do anything you want.  Remove  the 
internal barriers and the external barriers melt  away.  Oriental 
philosophy would call this "following the Tao." Achieving this is 
the challenge of magick.

                        HOW MAGICK WORKS

   How  can programming the subconscious affect the world  around 
us?  What  are the mechanisms involved?  According to the  occult 
view, it works because that is the nature of the universe.

   In the West,  we use the mechanistic paradigm. A paradigm is a 
pattern  or model,  in this case describing the way the  universe 
works.  We  use  paradigms  to  function,  usually  without  even 
realizing  it.  The mechanistic paradigm is one of the most basic 
that  underlie our culture.  This model states that there  is  an 
objective  reality  in  which  objects  interact  solely  through 
physical contact. Science has updated this to include fields like 
gravity and magnetism,  but the principle is the same. The result 
is  a universe in which the individual is nearly  powerless.  You 
can only make real change through physical action.  Magick is the 
act of making such changes non-physically,  so it does not fit in 
with the mechanistic paradigm.

   Most   westerners  are  unaware  that  the  magickal  paradigm 
represents a majority view among the world's cultures. Basically, 
it  is  the antithesis of the mechanistic view.  It  states  that 
there is no objective universe,  only subjective universes. These 
3270

universes  are the perceptions of each individual.  You  couldn't 
possibly  do any experiment that would show your universe  to  be 
either subjective or objective. You must be an objective observer 
in  order  to  tell  the  difference.  You  are  automatically  a 
subjective observer because you are in the universe. That's life. 

   At this point,  there is no practical difference between these 
views.  The universe looks the same either way.  But the magickal 
paradigm  also states that the universe is an expression of  your 
perceptions  and your perceptions are that part of yourself  over 
which  you have control.  When you change your own attitudes  and 
preconceptions,   the   universe  will  follow.   This  gives  an 
individual  as  much  power  over the universe  as  he  has  over 
himself.

                           Metaphysics

We  obviously  don't exercise infinite power.  There is  more  to 
magick than merely having a desire or belief.  That is because we 
have  many conflicting desires and beliefs on many levels.  There 
is  a level called,  among other things,  the Little  Self.  This 
roughly  corresponds to the subconscious and the super  ego.  The 
ego,  the  part of ourselves which we think of as "I," is  called 
the Middle Self. The Little Self is the gateway to the High Self, 
our connection with godhead and the universe. Infinite power lies 
with  the High Self,  but our access is through the  Little  Self 
which has its own ideas.  The Little Self is aware of and accepts 
everything around it and everything you think,  even when you are 
not  aware.  These perceptions build up very strong ideas in  the 
Little Self.  When these ideas are different from yours (those of 
the Middle Self),  your ideas loose.  To succeed,  you must unify 
your will. 

   Of  course,  people  rightfully  complain that even if  we  do 
create our universe,  it's still tough to make changes.  That  is 
because  there is quite a bit of inertia to ideas that have  been 
strongly  supported  since childhood (or before,  if  you  accept 
past-lives).  In an extreme example, the original "Peter Pan" had 
to  be  changed to keep from harming children.  In  the  original 
version,  the  characters  flew  because  "they  believed."  Many 
children  attempted to fly and discovered the hard way that their 
Little Self did not agree. Things like a belief in gravity may be 
possible  to overcome,  but no one will argue that it's  commonly 
done. 

   This example sounds silly because our experience of gravity is 
so  compelling  that  it seems ridiculous to consider  it  to  be 
"merely  a thought construct." But another belief that is  nearly 
as  widespread is that of poverty.  This is a significantly  less 
daunting belief which many have overcome.  As long as you believe 
you  are poor,  you will be.  This is often a very strong belief. 
Many  cannot even genuinely imagine themselves as being  wealthy. 
But,  because  it is not beyond reasonable comprehension,  it  is 
possible  to reprogram your Little Self-- much  as  it's possible 
for  left-handers  to  learn to be  right-handed.  Magick  is  an 
effective way to do this.

   If you are unconvinced,  consider how many little messages you 
3271

heard  when  growing  up,  which you now believe on  some  level. 
Frequent messages, especially with children, usually become true. 
If  you  have heard all your life that you are poor  or  dumb  or 
unsuccessful, eventually you believe it and eventually it's true. 
You  probably  know many people with an unjustifiably  poor  self 
image.  This  is  an  image which their Little  Selves  accepted, 
probably during childhood when they couldn't protect  themselves. 
That is how messages to the Little Self work against you. And the 
Little Self is aware of everything,  even when you are asleep. It 
also believes everything it hears. So the next time that you hear 
that  you're not good or that you need to buy a product that  you 
don't really want,  consciously give your Little Self a different 
message. Talk to it and tell it what you want to believe. This is 
what  makes your universe,  so make it the way you want it.  When 
you  have a particularly powerful belief to  overcome,  then  you 
must send a powerful message. That is the role of magick.

                            Religion

   The religious rendition of magick is prayer. Although they are 
different things, the principles are similar. Techniques that are 
effective for one will work very well in the other. In fact, they 
use  many  common symbols.  One could say that magick is  secular 
prayer.

   Prayer  works when "God answers it." This is entirely in  line 
with  the metaphysical explanation.  You can say that the  Higher 
Self is God or your connection to God. This is simply a different 
way  of expressing the same ineffable principles.  You can  adapt 
anything  here  to fit into your views.  Don't let the way  these 
concepts are phrased put you off.  Feel free to interpret this as 
much  as  you like in order to make it acceptable and  usable  to 
you.

                           Psychology

   The  explanations so far require new way of thinking about the 
universe,  but those entrenched in the mechanistic paradigm  need 
not miss out. Psychology has enough respect as a science to offer 
hope. If you replace Little Self with subconscious, the principle 
is  the  same.  Although there is no longer a source of  infinite 
power or non-physical change. But influencing the subconscious is 
the next best thing in a mechanistic world. 

   Psychologists   would   say  that  magick  directs  all   your 
unconscious  efforts toward your goal.  It also eliminates  those 
unconscious  efforts  keeping you from your goal.  This  may  not 
sound like much, but it is primarily these efforts that determine 
success or failure.  It is easy to overlook because, for the most 
part,  the  conscious will is the same as the  unconscious  will. 
Thus,  we succeed at endeavors such as waking up, getting to work 
on  time and fixing dinner.  This may seem silly,  but when  your 
subconscious  doesn't  share  a  goal,   even  simple  tasks  are 
exceptionally difficult. The power of the subconscious can either 
fight  you  or  help you.  Where ever you  succeed,  it's  almost 
certainly  helping.  Where ever you fail,  it's almost  certainly 
fighting.

3272

   The  subconscious represents everything the mind does that  we 
do not think about.  This involves a most of what we do. When you 
are  driving  on a familiar freeway in good conditions,  you  are 
usually  thinking  about  the  music  on  the  radio  or  salient 
problems.  At such times it is your subconscious driving.  If you 
notice  something strange in the road,  it was your  subconscious 
that brought it to your attention. This is very helpful, but that 
isn't  necessarily the case.  The subconscious can throw  up  all 
kinds  of barriers,  preventing even the simplest tasks.  It  can 
make  you late for work when it doesn't feel like going-- you can 
wake  up  late,  feel  ill,  misplace car keys or  even  have  an 
accident.  This influence sometimes goes to the extremes.  People 
can even be paralyzed by hysteria, a condition that lies entirely 
within  the  mind.  Pathological fears are  another  example.  An 
agoraphobe,  for instance,  can have such an extreme reaction  to 
being outdoors that he cannot leave his house no matter how badly 
he wants to.

   The  subtle  action  of  the subconscious  can  be  almost  as 
profound.   Even  when  the  influence  of  the  subconscious  is 
indistinguishable  from  chance happenings,  on larger scale  the 
effect is dramatic.  Psychologists try to ensure that experiments 
are  "double  blind"  for  this  reason.  They  must  set  up  an 
experimental group and a control group.  In the latter,  there is 
only the single element,  the target of the experiment,  that  is 
different. 
 
   In  drug  testing,  experimenters  use placebos on  a  control 
group.  The act of administering a substance can have a  profound 
mental effect, even when that substance is inert, a placebo. When 
they expect effective drugs, people can have great results with a 
placebo.  But  the "placebo effect" is purely  psychological.  If 
either the experimenter or the subject think that they know which 
is  being administered,  that is enough to throw off the results. 
The  subconscious  of  the subject reacts  to  what  the  subject 
expects. If the experimenter knows what he is administering, then 
the subject's subconscious reacts to cues from the experimenter's 
subconscious.  This  is sometimes called the "Clever Hans effect" 
after  a horse which seemed to be able to do  math.  In  reality, 
clever  Hans but was reacting to cues from the people around him. 
When someone near him knew the answer, the horse could sense that 
person's  expectation.  It was sometime before  researchers  even 
considered   these   nearly  invisible   clues.   Although   such 
subconscious  actions  are  very subtle,  they  can  dramatically 
change the results of an experiment.

   The  subconscious  similarly affects results in your  life  as 
well.  Magick programs the subconscious to work for you.  This is 
not  as potent as the metaphysical concept,  but it will make you 
as  effective as you can possibly be in a  mechanistic  world.  A 
unified  will directs all your efforts,  conscious and otherwise, 
toward   your   goal.   Since  the   subconscious   can   present 
insurmountable  barriers,  working  out these barriers is all  it 
takes to be on the road to success.

   Some   may   be  disturbed  to  think  that  magick   may   be 
misrepresenting  how it works,  but that should not be a problem. 
In  one  experiment,  scientists  gave placebos  to  a  group  of 
3273

subjects.  After  the  placebos  "took  effect,"  the  scientists 
explained what they were.  Even when the scientists made it clear 
to the subjects that the placebos had no biochemical action, many 
subjects  still  wanted  a prescription for them.  (It  would  be 
interesting to see how much more effective prescription  placebos 
are  versus over the counter placebos.) Were these people stupid? 
Or were they wise to stick with something that worked? 

                           New Science

   Those  that  cannot extricate themselves from old  mechanistic 
views  need an excuse to allow the placebo effect to  bring  them 
success.  Ironically,  the  same discipline which made magick  so 
difficult  can now provide this excuse.  Scientists are exploring 
some  new  ideas  which  depart  from  the  founding  mechanistic 
paradigm.  Ideas consonant with the magickal paradigm show up  in 
Jung's  synchronicity,  quantum physics,  the Gaia hypothesis and 
the morphogenetic field hypothesis (see Rupert Sheldrake's "A New 
Science  of  Life").  When these views  obviously  challenge  the 
traditional mechanistic paradigm,  they are a source of hostility 
or  amusement.  When the challenge is more subtle,  people ignore 
it.  Never the less,  the West is gradually turning toward a view 
more  in tune with magick.  With greater  frequency,  people  are 
willing  to consider the idea that we affect our universe on more 
than just a physical level. 

   Scientific  evidence  now supports the idea of  non-physically 
affecting  your  environment.  Quantum physics suggests  that  an 
experimenter's  goals  seem  to  create  whatever  particle  he's 
looking  for.  The morphogenetic field hypothesis  suggests  that 
actions   affect  all  other  actions  to  the  degree  that  the 
circumstances are similar. This explains why it becomes easier to 
grow  a  certain  type of crystal over time and  how  new  animal 
behaviors "jump" from one isolated population to another. Science 
is  continually  finding support for things  that  metaphysicians 
have said for millennia. 

   If  your  respect  for science is such that  you  cannot  take 
magick seriously,  do some research into these areas.  If you can 
find an acceptable explanation, then you can respect magick. This 
respect  is essential for success.  But don't look for  "proofs." 
The  concept of magick is nebulous.  It's designed to explain the 
way  things  are.   "Contrary  evidence"  only  shows  that   you 
misunderstand.   Change   your  definition  to  include  the  new 
evidence. 

   Magick  can  never be proven wrong because it can't be  pinned 
down.  Since  it explains a subjective reality,  it can never  be 
proven  right,  either.  The magickal paradigm will  confirm  any 
preconceptions,  so  the mechanistic paradigm will look "true" if 
that  is  what  you expect.  Since it  also  postulates  so  many 
unknowns  in the mind,  this paradigm states that what you get is 
what you expected.  As with so many things,  you will believe  if 
you  want to and you won't if you don't want to.  But when you're 
on  the  fence,  the right explanation can help  you  accept  the 
possibility.  Only  then  you  can honestly try  magick.  If  you 
experiment with a negative attitude,  it is the nature of  magick 
to confirm this.  Magick works best for those practical enough to 
3274

be skeptical, but open minded enough to give it an honest try. If 
a  part of you is genuinely interested in magick,  work to become 
comfortable with it.  Start with simple and harmless work.  Leave 
the embarrassing stuff for later,  after you've seen it work  and 
you don't care so much if your friends find out. 

   Avoid  getting too involved in the "explanations." If you need 
one,  pick whichever you like. It doesn't have to be any of those 
here.  Each  has to build his own models.  In any  case,  reality 
transcends  the  understanding of  waking-consciousness,  so  any 
expressible  explanation  is "wrong" in  the  traditional  sense, 
anyway.  For  a  good  illustration,  try to  "understand"  wave-
particle  duality  in  any but  a  mathematical  sense.  It's  as 
impossible to picture as a four dimensional cube.

   However  the  universe "actually is," always act in  a  manner 
that  is responsible in an objective universe.  If this were  not 
essential,  people  would  have abandoned the objective  universe 
long ago. Objective or subjective, there are many empirical rules 
of behavior that we all know.  Magick doesn't change these rules. 
Don't drive crazily because you've done a protection spell. Don't 
spend unwisely because you've done a prosperity spell. Don't jump 
off a building because you've done a flight spell.  Remain within 
these  rules  and  you  loose nothing by  acting  as  though  the 
universe  is  subjective.  You should not be doing  anything  you 
don't  want  to  do in the first place,  because  such  acts  are 
pointless in either universe.  If the universe is objective, then 
you  have had some harmless fun.  If the universe is  subjective, 
then  you  have  the chance to get  anything  you  want.  If  you 
approach it properly, you can't lose.

                  THE EMPIRICAL RULES OF MAGICK

                     Karma, the golden rule

   So far you have read a few possible explanations of how magick 
works.  This is to open your mind to the fact it *can* work.  But 
any   explanation  puts  a  limit  on  the   possibilities.   The 
possibilities  which a model rules out are much harder to achieve 
while   you  use  that  model.   Please  don't   limit   yourself 
unnecessarily.  But  remember,  no matter how much you may try to 
believe  that you can fly,  it's not likely you'll  succeed.  The 
obvious  lesson  here is,  be careful:  test the waters  of  your 
subconscious, act responsibly (but not over cautious). Don't jump 
off a cliff after your first flight spell.  Don't quit work after 
your  first job spell.  Start slow and find out how  your  Little 
Self works before you do any life changing work.

   There  is  a hazard so universal that you should treat  it  as 
fact:  Karma.  This is the old saw of,  "what goes around,  comes 
around."  You  attract  things of a similar nature  to  what  you 
concentrate  on (similar to morphogenetic fields).  And remember, 
when  you concentrate on something,  your Little Self does so  at 
least  as  much.  The  mechanistic reason for this  may  be  "the 
subconscious  mind  directing  subtle  actions  to  bring   about 
circumstances  in  tune with its thoughts." Metaphysicians  often 
explain it as "like vibrations attracting like."

3275

   Everything has a "vibration." This is similar to the vibration 
of musical notes,  though obviously not the same. As with musical 
notes,  one  vibration  can start a  sympathetic  vibration.  One 
vibrating  piano  string  will start similar  strings  vibrating. 
Karma  is  the  word for this principle in  magick.  There  is  a 
certain  vibration associated with any act.  If you hit  someone, 
the  emotions  and actions involved are of a  certain  vibration. 
This  will  tend  to  attract  things  of  a  similar  vibration, 
primarily violent acts.  You will tend to attract someone to  hit 
you.   It  turns  out  that  everything  you  do  to  others  you 
essentially also do to yourself, and vice versa. It sounds trite, 
but  being  nice to others and yourself truly makes the  world  a 
better place for everyone.

   It  doesn't  matter how you understand karma,  or even if  you 
believe in it-- you are warned.  Many people  don't  believe. The 
action of karma,  particularly on such people,  is often too slow 
to  notice.  It  can  easily take lifetimes for a  soul  to  work 
through karma.  But the soul will, so avoid bad thoughts. This is 
impossible,   but  you  will  get  better  with  practice.   Each 
unpleasant thought has a negative effect on you and others.  This 
brings negative things into your life. This is pretty rotten, but 
remember that each positive thought brings positive things-- that 
can  be pretty good.  In any case,  you needn't respect karma  to 
find yourself a happier person for trying to live this way.
 
   If  you are just learning about karma,  you will probably find 
that it is now a little more obvious in your life.  But sometimes 
it's difficult to figure.  If you do a spell to heal someone, you 
would  expect  to  be  attracting  good  things.   But  what   if 
immediately  afterward  you receive a transfer back home to  live 
near your scummy relatives?  Hardly fair!  Yet that's the kind of 
result  you  can expect if you do anything to  a  person  without 
permission.  People  have enough difficulty with their own Little 
Selves,  it's  nearly impossible to divine the desire of  someone 
else's.  The most beneficent act could violate someone's will  on 
some  level.  If the person asks you,  then you are free to  act. 
But,  even  if you are absolutely sure that the person would want 
it, if he hasn't asked you, don't do it. 

   Another  fantastic  example is the love spell.  Do a spell  to 
attract  the  kind of person you want,  not  a  specific  person. 
Exercising  your  will on others without their consent is  always 
nasty--  doing  so  magickally has  an  even  higher  cost. Watch 
yourself.   Many  people  working  with  magick  do  so  under  a 
"threefold law." This means that any karmic response is  tripled. 
This  is  to  keep people particularly scrupulous when  they  are 
fooling around with this stuff. Take it seriously.

                          Know Thyself

   Karma is best described by the golden rule, "Do unto others as 
you  would have them do unto you." The other major rule of magick 
is  just  as  common place,  "Know thyself."  This  is  essential 
because of the Little Self.  Magick is the science of  expressing 
your  will.  Because  there  are many aspects to  your  will,  it 
follows  that  you must be aware of all these aspects  to  be  an 
effective magician.
3276

   "Know  thyself" means be aware of the thoughts and feelings of 
your Little Self.  Learn how it feels about the things you  want. 
Learn  it's  beliefs.  You  must  know  your  starting  point  to 
effectively change negative beliefs.  To do this, you have to pay 
attention  to  all  the subconscious cues that your  Little  Self 
gives you. Explore your feelings, keep track of your dreams, look 
at  your past.  One of the best clues is your own  life.  If  you 
create  everything on some level,  then part of you "wants"  each 
thing in your life. You must not deny this, but work with it. The 
goal is healing because destruction is at best temporary. 

   Different   desires  on  other  levels  interfere  with   your 
conscious desire.  Your Little Self picks them up everywhere. You 
must be aware of this so that you can counteract it.  Every ideal 
commonly  in  the  mass media  impresses  itself  strongly.  When 
Madison  Avenue  spreads  the word that young and  thin  are  the 
ideal,  your Little Self will accept this if you are not careful. 
If you are not young and thin, this message undermines your sense 
of  self worth.  The resultant sense of undeserving works against 
your success. There is so much exposure to these messages that it 
is a real battle to avoid them.  Particularly in childhood,  when 
we can't protect ourselves,  others deeply ingrain ideas that can 
be  with  us  for life.  You must work  hard  to  discover  these 
feelings and counter act them.  If part of you feels undeserving, 
genuine success seems impossible.

   There  are other aspects to this problem.  Not only might  you 
feel  undeserving,  but you could even desire failure.  There are 
many reasons for this,  usually based in childhood.  Whatever the 
cause,  you  must look at your failures to see if there might  be 
some  reward.  Many people are subject to  chronic  illness,  for 
instance,  because  of  the attention they get or  an  unpleasant 
situation  they avoid.  If you really want to succeed,  you  must 
consciously release your desire for the rewards of failure.

   You  must also look at the fear of success.  Many times we  do 
not  consider  the problems associated with what we are  striving 
for,  but  the  Little  Self  does.  It  may  be  afraid  of  the 
responsibility  of a better job or a new  spouse.  Think  through 
your  goals  very carefully.  What would life be like if you  had 
what  you  desire?  You will have to address any  new  tasks  and 
responsibilities.  You  will have to be aware of any  sacrifices. 
Once  you  are  sure that you want not only your  goal,  but  the 
sacrifices  and responsibilities that go with  it,  then  release 
your fears.  People fear change,  because it is unknown. You must 
be aware that you are taking a leap and welcome it. Have faith in 
your Self.  When you know your Little Self well enough,  you will 
be able to trust that it will bring you what you desire. When you 
don't know it that well,  work on that. If you fail, it's time to 
work harder.

   When  you  and your Little Self have the same goals,  and  you 
have healed all the blocks to your success,  you *know* that what 
you want is coming.  When you know, you do not feel desperate. If 
you are feeling desperation, you are blocking. In that case, back 
to work! When you have worked hard enough, then you are ready for 
the  easy part,  the spell or ritual.  When you enter ritual  you 
should  know what you want and why you want it.  You should  have 
3277

healed  all  feelings of failure and undeserving and  you  should 
know  that  your  spell will bring it.  Work  to  cultivate  this 
feeling of calm expectation,  it is an important key. When you do 
a ritual, you will release all the power you have built to do its 
work on the universe.  You should not even have to think about it 
again.

   Once you achieve this,  though,  there is another caveat. Many 
people  have  something  unpleasant  happen  to  them  and  later 
realized  that  they had asked for it.  "Be careful what you  ask 
for,  you  just might get it." Always think carefully about  what 
you  want and how you ask for it.  Once again,  solid  background 
work is the key.

                          USING MAGICK
    
   Magick  is a field with many different disciplines.  There  is 
sympathetic,  Earth,  Ceremonial,  Enochian, Celtic, Egyptian and 
Kabbalah  magick just to begin.  These are occasionally different 
in their basic techniques,  but mostly they differ in the symbols 
they  use to achieve their goals.  The principles are  the  same, 
however.  Whichever form you prefer,  it is how you observe these 
principles that determines your success.  Beyond that, it is only 
personal preference. 

   Preference is very important, too. It is your Little Self that 
you  are  addressing,  and it is as individual as you.  You  must 
learn what works best for you.  The first clue is what appeals to 
you most.  Once you find the best methods for you, you build your 
own  personal  magickal system.  It is up to you  to  find  these 
methods,  through research and experimentation.  There is so much 
information  that  it  is impossible to give more than  a  sample 
here.  The information in this book is enough to get started.  It 
is  your work that will complete it.  If you are happy with  what 
you get on your own,  you need never open another book.  But  you 
must  at  least pay constant,  careful attention to your work  to 
fine tune it.  As with anything,  the more work you put  in,  the 
better your success.

   The  first  principle  is  to  take  what  you're  doing  very 
seriously.  This  is  not  so easy when  you're  struggling  with 
society's  negative attitudes.  Ignore any intrusive thoughts you 
might have. Concentrate on what you are doing. You must passively 
avoid  any distractions.  Do not try to actively avoid  them  for 
that  usually becomes an even bigger distraction.  As long as you 
enter with the right attitude, the rest will come with practice.

   Magickal ritual is a very special thing. You must set it apart 
from your ordinary functions.  When you do this, your Little Self 
is aware that you have that an important message to give it.  Not 
only  is  the message less cluttered by stray  thoughts,  but  it 
proceeds  more  directly  to the Little Self.  The  more  special 
things  you have surrounding your ritual,  the more effective  it 
is. (As long as you don't have so much that these things become a 
distraction in themselves.)

   Pick  a time when you are relaxed and awake and not under  the 
influence  of any drugs (e.g.,  alcohol or medication).  Take the 
3278

phone off the hook and see that you are not disturbed.  Create  a 
"sacred  space"  that  is only for ritual.  If you can set  up  a 
regular  time  or  place which you use  for  nothing  other  than 
ritual, this is ideal.

   Before you begin,  take a bath or at least wash your hands and 
use  this  to  symbolically  wash away  all  other  thoughts  and 
distractions  in  your mind.  Relax your body  and  mind.  Remove 
watches  and tight clothes.  Make sure the time of the ritual  is 
clearly  separated from your usual day.  Use a symbolic act  like 
knocking three times to open and close the ritual.  Anything that 
you  can add to the ambience will help:  incense,  special or  no 
clothing,  candle light, silence or meditative music (or whatever 
music  is appropriate to the spell-- be careful of  any lyrics!). 
If  you  know a second language that you don't ordinarily  speak, 
such as hebrew or latin, you may want to use this. Alternatively, 
you can use the Thee's and Thou's of archaic english.

   During the ritual,  concentrate on your goals.  Make sure that 
your ritual is not so long that you can't keep your mind focused! 
It  is better to repeat a ritual over days or weeks than to  have 
an  enormously  long  one in which you spend most  of  your  time 
thinking  about balancing your checkbook.  Know what you will  do 
before  you  start.  You  may ad lib,  but your purpose  must  be 
completely clear before you start.  Don't be surprised,  however, 
if  a  ritual  goes  differently  from  expected.  You  may,  for 
instance,  gain  an insight as you work that seems  unrelated  to 
your goal. It is important to consider this! It may be the key to 
what you are trying to achieve.  It may also be a distraction, so 
be aware.

                          The Attitude

   Since  magick  is the science of controlling  your  Self,  the 
entire  key is in attitude.  Not only must you take it seriously, 
but you must also cultivate the right feelings. You must want and 
expect your goal.
   
   Wanting seems easy, but this is deceptive. That is because the 
many  facets  of a personality often want different  things.  You 
must unify your desire just as you must unify your will. A person 
who grew up abused may learn,  on some level,  to associate  this 
with  love.  That person's Little Self will seek out abuse as  an 
expression  of  love.  It will want abuse even if the  individual 
does not.  Changing the desire of the Little Self to that if  the 
individual is the challenge.
  
   An even bigger challenge is that of expectation.  According to 
the  magickal paradigm,  you not only get what you want,  but you 
get it in the way that you expect it. Thus, if you do a spell for 
money  and  you  think "I'll never win the  lottery,"  the  money 
cannot  come that way.  If the spell is to work,  the money  must 
come from another source, such as finding a better job. Too often 
we rule out all possibility.  When you do a spell,  you know that 
has already worked.  If you do not know this,  it has not worked. 
This is the ideal.  It may well take some time before you work up 
to this point.

3279

   For  these reasons it's usually best to start slow.  Remember, 
to be completely successful, you have to want and expect on every 
level. Begin with a project easier than levitation! Work your way 
up  to  something  life  changing  only  after  you  have  proven 
yourself.  And don't look for dramatic results.  Don't rule  them 
out, of course-- you can win the lottery or even have ET hand you 
a  suitcase of money.  But remember,  this is dealing in what you 
believe,  and  people  rarely believe that  dramatic  things  can 
happen to them. 

   Look at magick as an extra push-- something to make the random 
events break your way.  In addition to magickal means, strive for 
your goals on the earthly level. Preliminary results usually tend 
toward  things  like improved success in your ordinary  pursuits: 
business picking up,  a bonus,  getting that job interview. Also, 
the energy you put into these mundane efforts also supports  your 
magickal work.  Even if you concentrate on winning a lottery, you 
must  at  least  buy a ticket.  All your efforts  help  to  build 
expectation and gives a very strong message to the Little Self. 
                                                                   
                           Affirmation                               

   The message you give to your Little Self is the most important 
aspect  of Magick.  The whole process is communicating the  right 
message.  Desire  and  expectancy  are  the  two  most  important 
messages.  But often these do not get across. The Little Self has 
the  understanding  of a child.  There are certain messages  that 
work well and quite a few that work disastrously.  You must learn 
how to talk to your Little Self.

   The  Little Self understands images and feelings;  it does not 
understand negatives or time. When you say "I will not fail," the 
image  in your mind is that of failure.  The message  to  another 
person  would  be  what you mean,  because  they  understand  the 
negation,  "not."  The  message  to the subconscious is  "I  will 
fail." Never,  never,  never use a negative when talking to  your 
Little Self. 

   If  you  change your message to,  "I will succeed," you  still 
have a problem. Since the Little Self does not understand time as 
we  do,  it will perpetually see success as being in the  future. 
Success  will  never arrive.  The proper  message  would  be,  "I 
succeed." This is not the way we are used to thinking,  but it is 
necessary for magickal work. Always formulate your goals this way 
when you begin a ritual or spell. In addition, the more you think 
in  this  way  in everyday life,  the more powerful will  be  the 
positive messages to your Little Self.

                          Visualization

   The  images  which  you give your Little Self  are  even  more 
important.  It  is  the  images  which your  words  conjure  that 
actually  do the communicating.  When you choose your  goal,  you 
should  try  to choose one or more images to  represent  it.  The 
image must include you in it,  either see yourself in a scene  or 
picture  it  as  if looking out of your eyes.  The  scene  should 
represent to you exactly what you desire.

3280

   The  more  you imagine in your  scene,  the  better.  Details, 
smells,  sounds  and textures all help enormously.  The scene  is 
most  effective when it brings up all the emotions that you would 
feel if you were actually there.  A drawing or picture is a  good 
aid. Surround yourself with as many things you can find that make 
you  think of your goal.  Imagine you have what you want and know 
you have what you want. That is a successful ritual.

                             Symbols

   Over the millennia, people have discovered symbols which speak 
to the Little Selves of nearly everyone.  Various sets of symbols 
form the foundation of the many different schools of magick. They 
are often culturally oriented. Because our culture is far removed 
from its magickal symbols,  each must discover his own. There are 
myriads  of occult books that offer as many different symbols  as 
you could want.  If you are interested, research them. Look first 
to your religion or ethnic background for your symbols. Mythology 
and astrology are also good sources.

   One  kind of symbol is the magickal tool.  This is a  physical 
object which you have consecrated for magickal work. If you have, 
for  instance,  a  cross  or  star  which you  want  to  use  for 
protection,  you  must empower the object for that purpose  in  a 
ritual.   You  will  direct  you  will,   through  statement  and 
visualization,  into  to  object.  From then on it is a  constant 
tangible reminder to you and your Little Self.  Treat it with the 
greatest respect.

   When you want to use a symbol,  first explore your feelings as 
you  look at it.  If it conjures the feelings you want,  then use 
it.  With symbols from a source, try do this before you read what 
the "authentic" meaning is. Sometimes you can get new information 
by  not prejudicing yourself.  Be careful if the meaning is  very 
different,  though.  If  you are not entirely in tune  with  your 
Little Self (and few beginners are), you may be missing something 
that will affect your spell.

                             Chakra
   To  give you an idea of what to look for and a sample to  try, 
here  is  a simple set of symbols based on  the  Chakra.  Chakrum 
(singular)  is  Sanskrit for wheel,  although vortex would  be  a 
better  word.  Chakra refers to points in the body where  certain 
energies  localize.  These  types of energies correspond to  many 
different things: herbs, stones, times, planets, moods, political 
beliefs.  It  is possible to relate anything to a  chakrum.  This 
chart gives points on the body, one of the many color schemes and 
how one experiences these energies.  This becomes useful when you 
seek a reinforcing energy. You can use this chart to decide where 
to  apply a magickal oil or what color is best to use in a  given 
project.

RED       ROOT            Physical Health and Energy
ORANGE    SPLEEN          Sexual and Reserve Energy (Second Wind)
YELLOW    SOLAR PLEXUS    Mental and Emotional Energy
GREEN     HEART           Love, Prosperity, Fertility, Growth
BLUE      THROAT          Command, Creation, Will, Expression
INDIGO    BROW            Magick, Psychic Energy
3281

LAVENDER  CROWN           Spirituality
WHITE     Positivity, all colors combined, the Universal Deity (God)
BLACK     absorbs negativity
PINK      Filial Love, "Agape" (look it up)
BROWN     Earthiness, Grounding, Hearth & Home
GOLD      Wealth
          TEMPLES         Thoughts, mind

The blue is a very light blue.  Indigo is a very dark blue,  like navy 
blue.  Lavender is a mixture of the colors and the energies of  red, 
indigo and white.  It is a very light color  which  you might be able to
see at the edge of a gas flame. The root chakrum is  at the base of the
spine.  The spleen is a few inches  higher and  to  your left or along
the spine (your  choice).  The  Solar Plexus at the navel (there is a
major nerve nexus here). The Brow or Third Eye Chakrum is associated
with the pineal gland.  On the skin, the point is on the brow between
the eyes. The crown is the top of the head,  associated with the
fontanelle (soft spot).  If you use something black (like obsidian) to
absorb negativity,  be sure  to wash it occasionally to get rid of the
negativity.  When you  burn  a black candle,  this creates a vacuum. 
This  may  be filled  by for negativity unless you also burn a white
candle  to bring in positive energy. 
                            EXERCISES

   Magick  is  not just an occasional exercise to bring what  you 
want,  it  is  a  way of life.  It requires  a  certain  kind  of 
relationship  with your Self.  This does not preclude any kind of 
life style or religion,  it is entirely separate.  It isn't  what 
you  do but why and how you do it.  Magick demands that you  love 
and respect your Self and that you accept your Power. This is the 
goal. "Getting what you want" is a small bonus.

   Building  a magickal relationship with your Self is much  like 
building one with a best friend.  You learn all you can about its 
beliefs  and  feelings.  You help heal it and it helps  you.  You 
achieve  this through communication and love.  You  love  through 
learning acceptance. You communicate by learning and listening to 
the language of the Little Self.

                             Dreams

   The  Little Self expresses itself most clearly in dreams.  You 
should  keep a regular dream diary.  Have a journal handy by  the 
bed.  As soon as you wake up in the morning,  write down as  many 
details as you can.  If you scribble down notes,  transcribe them 
into  a clear,  coherent text.  If you remember no dreams,  write 
this down. You should have an entry for every day that you sleep. 
It is best to record them in present participle (e.g.,  "I  dream 
that I am writing in my journal").

   Once  you  have a dream recorded.  Consider it and write  down 
your  impressions.  How does it make you feel?  To what  does  it 
pertain?  What  symbols  are there?  What does it tell you  about 
yourself and your life?  After you have considered these  things, 
you  may  choose  to  look up the possible  meaning  in  a  dream 
dictionary.  It  is  best  to do this afterward  because  someone 
else's interpretation could prejudice your own.  The advantage is 
that  many dreams are "contrary." Such dreams actually  mean  the 
3282

opposite  of what they seem to on the surface.  A dictionary  can 
help jog your awareness.  Once you've tried on your own, it's not 
a  bad  idea.  Remember,  though,  your impressions are the  most 
significant.

   You  can make great progress during your dreams as  well.  The 
more control you have in your dreams,  the more Power you have in 
your life. Try to develop this control. Remind yourself each time 
before  you  go  to bed that you will remember  your  dreams  and 
exercise your will in them. The ideal is called a waking or vivid 
dream.  In  this you are consciously aware that you are  dreaming 
and  everything,  especially  color,  is  very  clear.  The  most 
important  thing  to remember in a dream is to defeat  everything 
that attacks you. Attackers represent those things afflicting you 
during the day.  Don't let them beat you in your dreams.  If  you 
need help,  call for it.  When victorious, make the attacker give 
you  a gift.  The gift is the benefit that you can gain from  any 
situation.  Defeat your dream monsters and you gain power to face 
your real monsters.

   From  your dreams you can learn what your Little Self  desires 
and  fears.  You  can also gain powerful symbols for  your  work. 
These  are all highly personal and it is up to you to divine this 
information.  But,  don't try to interpret too much. Much of what 
you  dream is reviewing the events of the day and other items  of 
no great insight. Look at all your dreams and discover which ones 
hold meaning for you. Don't worry when you don't understand. Your 
Little  Self will keep trying when it has something important  to 
tell you. As long as you keep listening, you will progress.

                              Diary

   You should also keep a daily diary.  It too, is a line to your 
Little  Self.  Use this to record the events of the day and  your 
thoughts and feelings. These will reflect what is going on inside 
you.  Use  it also for introspection.  You must do a lot of  soul 
searching to learn about your Little Self, this is most effective 
when written. 

   It  is  even  more  important to track the  progress  of  your 
magickal  work.  Each time you do a spell or ritual  record  your 
goal, your feelings before and after and your methods. Before you 
get  to  this  point,  you  should also have  explored  all  your 
feelings  associated with it.  Then pay careful attention to  all 
that  happens  to you (part of the reason for the  daily  diary). 
Often, a spell will work and we will not even notice.

   Since magick works with what we believe,  things come to us in 
the way we expect or allow.  When you do a healing,  it will tend 
to  look entirely natural,  rather than miraculous.  If you do  a 
prosperity  spell,  receiving  a tax refund check  the  following 
month  could be the universe's response.  Keep an eye out for any 
hint  of possible results.  Even the weakest indication  is  very 
positive.  It may not be enough to satisfy, but it means that you 
are  being effective.  If you keep working,  you will be able  to 
improve  until you achieve the result you desire.  When you  give 
yourself  credit  for even the smallest success,  you  build  the 
relationship between you and your Little Self.
3283

                            Pendulums

   Another  good  way of communicating with your Little  Self  is 
through pendulum work. You can use any object on a string, but if 
it holds significance for you,  so much the better. Hold your arm 
steady and think about the pendulum swinging forward and back. It 
should eventually begin to do so without you *consciously* moving 
your arm.  Next change the movement to left and right by thinking 
about it. Once you can do this with facility, assign "yes" to one 
direction  and "no" to the other.  If you choose forward and back 
as "yes," alternate thinking the direction and thinking the word. 
Eventually,  even  when you start cold,  the pendulum will  swing 
forward and back when you think "yes." Repeat with the word  "no" 
for  the opposite direction.  Now you have a way of talking  with 
your Little Self. You can ask it questions directly.

   Eventually,  you  can even get your Little Self to spell words 
by  holding the pendulum over a semicircle with the  alphabet  on 
it.  The  direction of swing will indicate each  letter.  Another 
method  is automatic writing.  With this you hold a pen and relax 
and let "it" do the writing. (This may sound like an Ouija board, 
but  it is not.  Do not try to use one for this purpose  or  vice 
versa.)  Whatever method you use,  be careful.  Your Little  Self 
wants  to  please you.  It will tend to give you the  answer  you 
want.  Make  sure  you want the truth and that your  Little  Self 
understands this.  Always be friendly, as you would with a child. 
Praise  success and don't berate failure.  After all,  it is only 
trying to please. As usual, this requires regular work over time, 
but  eventually you can have such a good understanding  that  you 
need no tools. You will simply "know" how your Little Self feels. 
This is the ideal.

                           Meditation

   Another  way to achieve this awareness is through  meditation. 
This  is  a  method of calming the  conscious  mind.  There  many 
physical benefits from the stress reduction alone. It also allows 
your  inner thoughts and feelings to express themselves.  All the 
skills  you learn in meditation are very useful  in  magick.  Not 
only  is it a line of communication with the little self,  but it 
teaches  you  to quiet the conscious mind which is  essential  in 
ritual.  You  would  do  well take instruction  in  a  meditation 
technique such as yoga or self-hypnosis.

   If  you  are learning this on your own,  observe these  rules: 
Relax  your  body consciously and completely.  You must be  in  a 
comfortable,  calm environment to do this properly.  Starting  at 
your  feet,  think about each part of your body and let it relax. 
It may help to tighten the muscles first.  Use a cue to tell your 
mind  to relax.  This can be something like mentally  going  down 
stairs  or  counting backwards.  [Do not use a  common  cue.  For 
instance, "three, two, one" is something that you might encounter 
on the radio while driving.  This could be dangerous. It would be 
better to use,  "three,  three,  three,  two, two, two, one, one, 
one."  This is less likely to cause a problem.  It is dangerously 
easy  to get into a meditative state during automatic tasks  like 
driving.  This  you must avoid.] Once relaxed,  you can use  this 
state to allow subconscious thoughts to float to the surface,  or 
3284

you  can  use  it in ritual to give a powerful  message  to  your 
Little Self. This mental state is another key to magick.

   You  will  find  that  it  is very  difficult  to  focus  your 
conscious  mind at first.  See how long you can hold one word  or 
picture in your head without any other thought. It is probably an 
astoundingly  brief  time.  Watch  commercials to  see  how  many 
seconds  they  show one unchanging  scene.  This  represents  the 
average attention span. This is one of the reasons that magick is 
so difficult,  you must remain focused for the entire ritual.  Be 
aware of you concentration span. While it is short, you should be 
working  short  rituals.  It is better to have three  five-minute 
rituals than one half-hour ritual if you spend twenty minutes  of 
the latter thinking of other things.

   In  order to improve your concentration,  spend some time each 
day trying to hold a word or picture as long as possible. Another 
good exercise is to pick a word and try *not* to think of it  for 
a week.  Count how many times you think the word in your head, if 
you  think it again when counting it,  count that instance,  too. 
This is very difficult,  but eventually you will even be able  to 
hear or see the word without thinking it.

   These  skills immediately become useful in communicating  with 
your Little Self.  You will want to hold positive thoughts,  such 
as "I am a loveable,  successful person." You will want to dispel 
negative  thoughts,  as  when the T.V.  tells you,  "I  was  very 
unpopular  until I started using Crealm Toothpaste!" When you are 
trying to reprogram your Little Self,  feel free to use aids such 
as  subliminal tapes.  Another good one is colored  cards.  Place 
your simple,  direct message,  such as "I succeed," on a  colored 
card where you will see it each day. Put small pieces of the same 
color where you will encounter them throughout the day. Each time 
a bit of card comes in your field of view,  your Little Self will 
notice and remember the message, even when you don't.

   Symbolic acts are also very powerful.  When you clean out your 
house  and get rid of everything that you don't *need,* you  make 
way  for new things to come into your life.  This is a good thing 
to  do  in concert with a major change  in  your  life,  quitting 
smoking or graduation, for instance. It helps to tell your Little 
Self  that your old life is over and your new one has begun.  The 
more you can eliminate the symbols of your old life, the more you 
can shape your new life to your liking.  Be aware of all that you 
do, for you can use ordinary acts to give messages to your Little 
Self. Your morning shower can be a ritual to "wash away" all your 
stress or yesterday's mistakes. If you do this, however, you must 
*make*  it  a ritual.  Develop a routine and concentrate  on  the 
purpose  of  the act throughout.  This is true  of  all  magickal 
works.

   Once you have begun this work to focus your conscious mind and 
reprogram  your Little Self for success,  then you can begin some 
small  works  of magick.  You want to start  small  because  most 
people have difficulty accepting a great success on a deep level. 
If  start with a spell to win one million in the lottery and  you 
are not ready for this, your failure will set you back. If you do 
prosperity  spell  and  you get a small raise or win $10  in  the 
3285

lottery, that is a start that you can build on.

   One   of   the  better  starting  goals  is   manifesting   an 
insignificant  object.  Manifesting  means bringing it into  your 
life.  Things  tend to manifest in unremarkable ways,  so keep  a 
look out. The blue feather is a classic. Set up a ritual in which 
you concentrate on a blue feather.  See it,  feel it,  smell  it, 
want  it,  then let it go.  Then pay attention for the  following 
week  (and  keep  track in your journal).  You may  find  a  blue 
feather  on the side walk.  You may notice one for the first time 
on a billboard that you pass every day.  You may see one on  T.V. 
All of these are successes. 
   
   It  is  best to start with insignificant,  uncommon  (but  not 
rare) objects.  An uncommon object gives you a good indication of 
success.  A  rare  object is a challenge you can work up  to.  An 
insignificant   object  is  easier  because  you  do   not   have 
interfering  desires  or  fears.  You  have  to  be  relaxed  and 
confident  and let go of your desire as you complete the  ritual. 
You  should be able to manifest such an object before you proceed 
to  a greater challenge.  It is valuable to repeat this  exercise 
every so often in any case.

   Another good spell to start with is a spell to do good spells. 
That is,  you can use magic to help remove blocks and fears.  For 
instance,  if  you have discovered that you feel  unworthy,  this 
will  seriously  impair your ability to manifest what  you  want. 
But,  you  can use your desire for self worth to empower magickal 
work  toward  feeling  worthiness.  You can also do  a  spell  to 
support your ability to concentrate on your goal. This is just an 
extension  of all the other methods of getting messages  to  your 
Little Self.

   When you discover blocks and fears,  when thoughts intrude and 
your  mind  wanders,  or when you find yourself thinking  exactly 
what you're supposed to avoid,  don't worry!  This happens as you 
learn  to  control  your will.  The idea is not  to  avoid  these 
problems,  but  to *learn* to avoid them.  You can't do  this  by 
trying to force yourself.  There are no instructions on how to do 
this,  only  exercises.  Just  do  your stuff and the  rest  will 
follow.  When problem surfaces, recognize it and go on. Don't try 
to  stop it and don't dwell on it,  just continue.  You may  know 
that  you  have  "spoiled" a ritual with  a  stray  thought,  but 
complete it anyway-- it's a good exercise. Sometimes you can deal 
with stray thoughts by *trying* to think about them.  Concentrate 
on these thoughts and let your mind tire of them, then go on with 
your work.

   Work  steadily,  but not overly hard,  on these exercises  and 
make magick a part of your life.  Unify your will. Take and prove 
your  Power.  Only  after you have done this are you ready to  do 
magick.  When  you feel you are ready,  develop the messages  and 
visualization which will be the most powerful for you. Decide how 
you  are  going  to  set up your ritual area  and  how  you  will 
orchestrate your spell.  Whatever you feel best with is what will 
be  the  most  powerful.  If you need an idea of  how  to  start, 
consider the examples that follow.

3286


                             SPELLS

   Once  you have discovered and addressed your blocks,  you  are 
ready  to do a spell.  This is only a little different from  what 
you have already been doing.  In a spell you do nothing new,  you 
do it differently.  A spell is a ritual, an act carefully planned 
to have the greatest effect.  You must do the planning,  for only 
you  know what will be the most effective ritual.  Plan carefully 
and completely. You may want to use a script (it would be best to 
memorize  it).  You can ad lib once you're more  experienced.  At 
this point,  you have enough information to develop more powerful 
rituals  than you are likely to encounter in any  book.  However, 
since this is so different from what most of us are used to, here 
are some samples to give you a starting point.  Feel free to  use 
and change these rituals as you please. They are here to give you 
an idea of how you may want to approach things. 

   The  ritual starts in a special place.  It could be out in the 
woods  or in a special room.  Ideally,  you would never use  this 
place for anything but ritual,  but this may be impossible. If in 
the  home,  choose a quiet time and unplug the phone.  Make  sure 
that you are not disturbed.

   Before  the ritual,  carefully clean and arrange the area  and 
take a bath or wash your hands. Think about washing away the days 
thoughts and cares. You are now ritually purified. You should not 
engage in any mundane activity until after the ritual. Enter your 
ritual  area and knock three times,  to mark the beginning.  From 
this point all your thoughts are on the ritual. Don't do anything 
automatically.  No matter how familiar,  think about every action 
and what it means. 

   Light  candles  and  incense (only if there is  no  danger  of 
fire!).  Imagine  the ritual area surrounded in a circle of white 
light.  You  may  physically trace this circle to  reinforce  it. 
(Traditionally,  all  such movements are clockwise when  invoking 
and   counterclockwise  when  dispelling.)  Repeat  an   act   of 
purification.  This is like the bath only more symbolic.  You can 
hold your hand in the incense smoke and touch water from a ritual 
cup to your forehead, for instance. Next, relax and aum-- that is 
chant  the  mantra "ohhmmm" (or whatever works for you) to  bring 
your  mind  to the proper state of alert  relaxation,  ready  for 
work.

   At this point you will state your will. Tell your Self and the 
Universe   how  you  choose  it  to  be.   This  is  not   merely 
verbalization,  during ritual your word is law. What you say, is. 
Feel your statement with your entire being, with every sense. Use 
all the techniques that you have found effective.  Then,  let the 
feeling go. It is going out into the universe to do its work. End 
your  expression with a statement like,  "According to free  will 
and  for  the  good of all." This helps to  avoid  problems  with 
karma,  as  long as you mean it.  Do not allow other thoughts  to 
intrude at this point, it is now time to close the ritual. 

   Imagine  removing  the white light circle  (counterclockwise). 
Knock three times to end the ritual.  Put out the candles,  clean 
3287

each  item  and put it carefully away in  a  special  place.  The 
ritual  is  only  finished once you have completed all  of  these 
steps. Only then can you resume thinking about what's on the T.V. 
and how big a jerk your boss it. As a beginner, you should always 
be prepared to go through this entire procedure before you start. 
Even in an emergency, you should at least remove the white circle 
and knock (very quickly,  perhaps, but do at least this much when 
possible).  Nothing in a ritual is mundane, so it must be clearly 
delineated from your mundane actions.  Otherwise you will  dilute 
your spell and give the wrong messages to your Little Self.  When 
ritual is obviously separate,  your Little Self will know when to 
pay close attention.

   Once finished, do not talk about your work. Silence is another 
important key to magick. If you discuss it with anyone else, they 
cannot  help  adding  their  thoughts.   This  is  almost  always 
detrimental.  It is fine to work with people,  then your energies 
multiply.  But  never  talk about specific spells that  you  have 
done.

                     Destroying Your Enemies

   This  is one aspect of magick that attracts many.  It is a big 
mistake! Karma will get you every time. Don't try to rationalize. 
Though you may be able to put it off,  you will not escape karma. 
In the mundane world,  you might justifiably do violence in order 
to  defend yourself or another from physical attack.  In  magick, 
this justifies only defense, never attack. Don't imagine yourself 
to  be  an agent of karma or a martyr saving others at  your  own 
expense.  Who  ever  has  done  you  wrong  will  get  his.  It's 
frustrating to wait and we all want to be there when it  happens, 
but it is never worth trying to make it happen. 

   When  you  have  any  kind  of  relationship,  particularly  a 
magickal  one,  you develop a karmic tie.  You will want to avoid 
such ties with people you don't like. Even if you get the best of 
such  a person,  he will still drag you down.  It's difficult  to 
resist when you feel that the person owes you.  If you have  been 
swindled  and left with no legal recourse,  it's tempting to  use 
magick to get your money back.  Trying to get even will develop a 
tie  with this person and probably set you up for some bad karma. 
Don't  worry  about the money,  either.  You can  get  that  from 
anywhere (see "Prosperity"), In seeing this swindler as your only 
source  you  give your Power to him.  If you are brave,  you  can 
demand justice in such a situation.  This incurs no karmic  debt, 
but you,  too, can expect justice. Not very many people genuinely 
want  this.  Most prefer mercy because we have all done plenty of 
things  that  we would rather not have to pay for.  If  you  want 
mercy,  you must extend it to others.  When you ask for  justice, 
all your debts present themselves.  If you survive, great, but it 
won't  be  fun.  There are much safer ways of dealing with  nasty 
people.

                           Protection

   Psychic  attack  can  be  a  real problem  because  it  is  so 
prevalent.  When you make someone angry,  the person is attacking 
you.  Simply directing angry thoughts is a psychic attack.  (This 
3288

incurs bad karma,  so learn to avoid this yourself!) We all  have 
natural defenses,  so these attacks seldom have an effect. But if 
someone has ability,  or if he concentrates a lot of energy,  you 
are likely to suffer. Psychic attack usually comes in through the 
neck  and  manifests  as  a headache.  As  you  become  a  better 
magician,  you will be more sensitive to the energies around you. 
You  become  more vulnerable to psychic attack.  You also  become 
better able to defend yourself as long as you remain alert.  This 
work  will also help protect you from physical threats.  Keep  in 
mind that, though magic may help, you must still act responsibly!

Affirmations:  I am now safe and secure.  All negative influences 
are  reflected off me into the Earth to be healed.  I allow  only 
the positive into my life.

Visualizations:  See  an egg of white light around  you-- because 
this  keeps  in negative energy,  also see it filled with  violet 
light,  which  will turn the negative to positive.  Another  good 
visualization is three concentric circles around you (or whatever 
you wish to protect) of white (outside),  blue (middle) and  pink 
(inside).  Also, you can imagine a mirror at the back of the neck 
or encasing the whole body, reflecting outward.

Other: Religious symbols are especially good for this work. 

                          Purification

   Remember  that the things you have in your life are those that 
you have drawn to you.  When someone upsets you, he usually has a 
lesson to teach you. If you can learn this lesson, you can escape 
the situation. If you escape without learning your lesson, you'll 
probably be in a similar situation soon.  Sometimes people  often 
make us angry by reflecting a part of our personality that we are 
unhappy with. Also, the negative vibrations we pick up during our 
everyday lives attract negative things. The purpose of the ritual 
bath  is to remove such influences.  It is also a good idea to do 
an entire spell for purification.  This is not only good to do on 
yourself,  but  also your home and wherever else you  spend  much 
personal time.

Affirmations:  The  white  light  cleanses  me  of  all  negative 
thoughts  and energies.  Only positive feelings remain in  me.  I 
release all negative vibrations into the Earth to be healed.

Visualizations:  See  yourself  being  washed clean by  white  or 
violet  light  from above you (your High  Self).  Each  time  you 
inhale,  take in pure white light.  When you exhale,  release all 
your negativity. See this negativity go down into the earth to be 
healed.

Other:  Place a piece of rock salt under your tongue. Use incense 
smoke or water to cleanse yourself.  Again, religious symbols are 
very effective.

                              Love

   You  must take love spells very seriously,  for they are quite 
dangerous.  Never, never, never do a love spell on an individual. 
3289

This  is  often  a great temptation,  but  don't  even  risk  the 
possibility of imposing your will on another.  The karmic results 
are  severe.  Even  if you succeeded,  you would still lack  real 
love,  for you would have to continually renew the spell to  keep 
the person. What you want, among other things, is someone to help 
express your love for yourself.  As you will often hear, you must 
love yourself first.  This isn't a problem,  for you already love 
yourself-- that is the main reason you are alive.  The problem is 
when you block that love.  Eliminating these blocks is the Soul's 
goal. But don't despair, you needn't actually remove them to draw 
love  to  you.  Just beginning the work can attract that  special 
someone who will help. 

Affirmations:  I  am  a perfect manifestation of love and I  draw 
love  to me.  I now allow love to come into my life.  I feel  and 
express perfect love and draw other loving people into my life.

Visualizations: Picture yourself as a magnet, feeling and drawing 
love.  Imagine  yourself bathed in green or pink or orange light, 
depending on your goals.  Pink is for filial love (agape) and for 
that  of  a  lover.  Orange  is for  the  sexual  aspect  (spleen 
chakrum). Green is for both (heart chakrum). But the distinctions 
are somewhat blurred, for love is a combination of all of these. 

Other:  Friday is the day of Venus and the waxing to full Moon is 
a  time  of increase,  so these are good times  for  ritual.  The 
ubiquitous heart symbol can be useful.

                           Prosperity

   Money is not all there is to prosperity.  What do you want the 
money  for?  What kind of life do you want to live?  What do  you 
want to have?  Keep these goals in mind. You may get them instead 
of the money.

   As  you  work  though  your blocks  to  prosperity,  you  will 
probably  find  that one of the biggest  is  guilt.  Our  society 
functions under the assumption that a person can only gain at the 
expense  of  others.  Don't  try to get money by taking  it  from 
others through force or fraud,  magickally or otherwise.  That is 
giving  your Power away.  In the magickal paradigm,  you  create. 
When you understand this,  there is no greed because you can have 
whatever  you desire and without taking from others.  It  is  not 
money that is a root of evil,  but the love of money.  It doesn't 
matter  how  much  you get,  but how you get it.  When you  do  a 
prosperity  spell,  it  should  be a  joyful  expression  of  the 
infinite  supply available to you.  If you are begging or hopping 
to be rescued, you have more background work to do.

   Another aspect to remember is that money, like all other kinds 
of energy, flows. In order to get it, you have to spend it. There 
must  be  an outflux for there to be an influx.  This is  not  an 
excuse  to  be irresponsible!  It is easy for the flow to be  too 
much in either direction (especially out!).  Don't be miserly  or 
wasteful,  remember the flow. Use each bill you pay to remind you 
that  you've  drawn the money to pay it and that more money  will 
come to take its place.

3290

Affirmations: I allow prosperity to manifest itself in my life in 
great abundance.  I draw from the infinite source all the money I 
need and more.  In my life,  I now express the infinite supply of 
wealth around me.

Visualizations:  Imagine  yourself  bathed in green light  (heart 
chakrum).   This   is  a  situation  where  visualization   works 
particularly well,  because it's a tangible object.  You can even 
use a picture or model of the new home or car you want.

Other:  Good times for a prosperity ritual are Thursday,  the day 
for  increase,  and during the waxing Moon.  The $ (or approriate 
regional symbol) has a great deal of power-- consider using it.

                    Health & Self Improvement

   Your  body is the most direct expression of your Little  Self. 
It  is  one  of the most accessible,  yet challenging  things  to 
change.  If  you can find and address the root causes  of  health 
problems,  like  heat disease,  it is often relatively easy to do 
something  about  them.  But  self image  problems  can  be  very 
difficult because of the way our society approaches the subject. 

   Over weight is a good example of a self image problem. Madison 
Avenue  bombards  us  with  an ideal  of  beauty.  It  is  almost 
impossible to escape. If you are over weight and unhappy about it 
for other than health reasons, you are probably a victim of this. 
It  is dangerously easy to make self love or approval  contingent 
upon  losing  weight.   Until  you've  lost  it,   you  may  feel 
undeserving  and  thus fail.  You may succeed,  only to have  old 
habits  or new crises can throw you back into old eating  habits. 
You  have  made no fundamental change,  so the  cycle  reinforces 
itself. So many different problems manifest this way.

   You  will  certainly  want  to deal  with  eating  habits  and 
exercise,  but this is often insufficient.  People have different 
metabolic  rates  and different body types.  Do not  make  liking 
yourself  contingent upon your having a different body  type!  If 
you  dislike your body,  you dislike your Little Self.  You  must 
love  yourself  unconditionally.  This is the  same  transcendent 
spirit expressed in wedding vows:  for better or worse, richer or 
poorer,  in sickness and in health.  Love yourself not regardless 
of how you look,  but because of how you look. Wanting to improve 
doesn't  mean that you must dislike yourself as you are.  If  you 
were given $900, you wouldn't despise it because it wasn't $1000. 
Rejoice  in your Little Self's expression of being  alive.  Until 
you do, this lesson will hang over your head. Ironically, you are 
most able to change your looks when it matters to you least. 

   Remember to be responsible.  Always get good health care. When 
trying to lose weight,  follow a sane plan under a doctor's care. 
But  in addition,  work to love yourself unconditionally.  Strive 
constantly to fight the messages from the media and those  around 
you.  You  are a loving,  loveable person and your looks  reflect 
this.  Make  yourself aware of that.  When you succeed,  you  may 
eventually look like your ideal,  but even if you don't, you will 
see  the  beauty  in yourself.  You will be more able  to  defend 
yourself from those small minds unhappy enough to attack you  for 
3291

not  conforming to their ideal.  You will also draw those who can 
see  your beauty.  As an extreme example,  anorexics always  feel 
that  they are too fat.  They cannot lose more weight,  for  that 
would kill them. The answer lies with truly seeing themselves. 

   Any  time your goal is self improvement,  the principle is the 
same.  In order to better yourself,  you must first realize  that 
you are loveable, now and always. Never try to better yourself to 
become loveable-- it doesn't work.  The goal of magick is to heal 
those things you do not like in yourself,  not destroy them.  You 
better  yourself by first bettering your self image.  You  change 
your  behavior by healing the hurts that cause you to do  harmful 
things.  Recognize  that  all unhappy things are in  response  to 
pain.  Your Little Self can hurt you,  much as a favorite pet may 
bite  you because it is in pain.  Do not feel anger or misery but 
love and healing.

Affirmations:  I love myself completely as I am now.  I surrender 
to  love.  I know that I am a loving and loveable person.  I heal 
all  hurts.  I  now express perfect health in my  life.  I  bring 
complete health into my life. My body is now a beautiful, healthy 
expression of my Self.

Visualizations: Imagine yourself so close to the sun that you can 
see  nothing else.  Visualize the area you want to heal bathed in 
blue-green light.  Listen to or imagine the note F#.  Concentrate 
on  the heart and throat chakra (green and  blue,  respectively). 
The  root chakrum (red) is another good focus for  physical  well 
being.  When  healing someone not present,  put a photo next to a 
candle. Put the name of the subject on the candle and use this to 
focus your concentration. 

Other:  Rituals  to increase energy and health are most effective 
during the waxing moon and at high noon.  Rituals for eliminating 
disease  or losing weight are best done during the  waning  moon. 
The  five pointed star (symbol of Man) might be a good symbol (if 
you do not have any negative associations with it).
                                    

                           Good Luck!

   At this point you are on your own. It takes forty days to make 
or break a habit, so you should concentrate on daily exercise for 
at  least this long.  Magick is not a quick,  easy way of getting 
what  you  want.  It is a long,  hard  road.  Though  it's  quite 
possible  to  have  instant success,  visible  results  can  take 
months.  Real rewards can take years. But we all must travel this 
road  some time.  Be cautious of those promising an easier  path. 
Though  it may appear slow,  magick is one of the fastest ways of 
taking your Power.  The difficulty lies not in feats of  physical 
or mental prowess,  but in steady diligence. Do not try too hard, 
or you will not last long. If you are not happy with the way your 
life is going now and you desire to take your power,  then commit 
to  the life changes which magick demands.  If your commitment is 
genuine,  then everything will fall into place over  time.  Above 
all, be patient.

               Best of luck and stay on the path.

                          Nine Noble Virtues 
     (Written by Lewis Stead from the Raven Kindred's ritual book)

The Odinic Rite lists the 9 Noble Virtues as Courage, Truth, Honor,
Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Industriousness, Self-Reliance, and
Perseverance.

It would be hard to get much argument on any of these values from
anyone.  They simply and briefly encapsulate the broad wisdom of our
Gods and ancestors.

Courage

In virtually every statement of values applied to Asatru, Courage is
listed first.  As Stephen McNallen has said, courage and bravery are
perhaps the values which the Vikings are best known for.  However,
despite our history, few of us face such turmoil as a literal battle
for ones life.  In fact, I believe it might be easier to manifest
courage in such a situation than to do so in the many smaller day to
day occurrences in which courage is called for.

The most common of these occurrences for modern Pagans, is the courage
to acknowledge and live ones beliefs.  It is also, sadly, the one that
we most often fail at.  While we may often be full of the type of
courage that would lead us to face a shield wall, many of us quake at
the thought of the topic of religion coming up at the office or a
friend asking what church we attend.  We won't offer easy answers, but
we ask this: if you toast the courage of your ancestors to fight and
die for what they believed in, can you trade away your religious
identity for a higher salary or social acceptance?

In an essay on values there is also the question of moral courage.
The way of Tyr is difficultto lose ones hand for ones beliefsbut,
Tyr thought the price worth paying.  In a million ways modern society
challenges our values, not just as Asatruar who are estranged from
mainstream religious practice, but for religious people in an
increasingly not just secular, but anti-religious culture.  Values are
also not in favor in modern society.  Breaking or getting around the
rules is encouraged to get ahead.  Living honorably is simply too
inconvenient.  I think most people, Asatru or otherwise, find this
repugnant, but the only way to change it is to have the courage to
refuse to take part in it.

Truth

The second virtue, that of Truth, is the one that most led our kindred
to embrace the Odinic Rite's statement of values as our own.  Early in
our discussions, we decided that no matter what values we chose to
hold out as our own, truth must be among them.  It is a word that
holds so much in its definition, and includes such a wide variety of
moral and philosophical beliefs that we were all drawn to it as a
simple statement of what we stood for.

At least one of the reasons we wanted to adopt it was the simple issue
of honesty.  As Bill Dwinnels said at a recent sumbel while toasting
truth and honesty: if you don't want people to know about something,
don't do it.  Truth, in the sense of honesty, is essential to personal
honor and also to any system or morality that is not based on rigid
3294

legalism.  If one is to uphold an honor code, one must be brutally
honest with oneself and with others.

Truth is also the Truth that comes with a capital Tthe kind of Truth
that one talks about in terms of religion or morality.  It's common to
talk of different peoples having different "truths," but it's equally
important to remember that while we acknowledge that each person or
people has their own belief as to what Truth is or where to find it,
there finally is a single Truth.  This is not the Truth as we believe
it, but ultimate Truth.  While we may respect other people's truths
and seek our own, we must never forget our search for The Truth.  Like
the Holy Grail of Christian legend, it may never be ours to reach, but
when we cease to search we perish.

Honor

Honor is the basis for the entire Asatru moral rationale.  If anything
comes out in the Eddas and Sagas it is that without honor we are
nothing.  We remember two types of peoples from ancient times: those
whose honor was so clean that they shine as examples to us and those
who were so without honor that their names are cursed a thousand years
after they lived.  Good Asatruar should always strive to be among the
former.

However, honor is not mere reputation.  Honor is an internal force
whose outward manifestation is reputation.  Internal honor is the
sacred moral compass that each Asatruar and God should hold dear.  It
is the inner dwelling at peace which comes from living in accordance
with ones beliefs and with ones knowledge of the Truth of what one is
doing.  It is something deeply personal and heartfelt, almost akin to
an emotion.  It's a knowing that what one is doing is right and
decent and correct.

In many ways while the most important of all the virtues it is also
the most ephemeral in terms of description.  It is all the other
virtues rolled together and then still more.  The best way I have
found to describe honor is that if you are truly living with honor,
you will have no regrets about what you have done with your life.

Fidelity

Fidelity is a word that is far too often defined by it's narrow use in
terms of marital fidelity.  By the dictionary it simply means being
faithful to someone or something.  In marriage this means being true
to ones vows and partner, and this has been narrowly defined as
limiting ones sexual experience to ones spouse.  While I have found
this to be great practical advice, many treat fidelity as if there
were no other ways in which one could be faithful or unfaithful.

For we Asatruar fidelity is most important in terms of our faith and
troth to the Gods.  We must remain true to the Aesir and Vanir and to
our kinsmen.  Like marriage, Profession (the rite in which one enters
the Asatru faith, similar to Christian confirmation or Wiccan
initiation) is a sacred bond between two parties; in this case an
Asatruar and the Gods.  In order for such a relationship to work, both
must be honest and faithful to each other.

Asatru, although currently being reborn, is at its roots a folk
3295

religion and we also uphold the value of fidelity to the ways of our
ancestors.  This is why historical research is so important to the
Asatru-folk: it is the rediscovering of our ancient ways and our
readoption of them.

Discipline

In any discussion of the values of Asatru, discipline is best
described as self-discipline.  It is the exercise of personal will
that upholds honor and the other virtues and translates impulse into
action.  If one is to be able to reject moral legalism for a system of
internal honor, one must be willing to exercise the self-discipline
necessary to make it work.  Going back to my earlier criticism of
society, if one rejects legalism, one must be willing to control ones
own actions.  Without self-discipline, we have the mess we currently
see in our culture.

Looking at discipline in terms of fidelity, we see a close connection.
Many Pagans go from faith to faith, system to system, path to path.
Asatruar are much less likely to do this.  The discipline of keeping
faith with our Gods and the ways of our ancestors is part of our
modern practice.  In this way, we limit ourselves in some ways, but we
gain much more in others.

Hospitality

Hospitality is simply one of the strongest core values at the heart of
virtually every ancient human civilization.  In a community/folk
religion such as our own, it is the virtue that upholds our social
fabric.  In ancient times it was essential that when a traveler went
into the world he could find some sort of shelter and welcome for the
night.  In modern times it is just as essential that a traveler find
friendship and safety.

In our modern Asatru community, we need to treat each other with
respect and act together for the good of our community as a whole.
This functions most solidly on the level of the kindred or hearth
where nonfamilial members become extremely close and look out for
each other.  It can mean hospitality in the old sense of taking in
people, which we've done, but in modern times it's more likely to mean
loaning someone a car or a bit of money when they need it (that's
need, not want).

Part of hospitality is treating other people with respect and dignity.
Many of our Gods are known to wander the world and stop in at people's
houses, testing their hospitality and generosity.  The virtue of
hospitality means seeing people as if they were all individuals with
self-respect and importance.  Or perhaps from time to time, they are
literally the Gods in human form.  This has profound implications for
social action in our religion.  Our response to societal problems such
as poverty (that's poverty folks, not laziness) is in many ways our
modern reaction to this ancient virtue.

In terms of our modern community as a whole, I see hospitality in
terms of frontier "barn raisings" where a whole community would come
together and pool their resources.  This doesn't mean we have to
forget differences, but we must put them aside for those who are of
our Folk, and work for our common good.
3296

Industriousness

Modern Asatruar must be industrious in their actions.  We need to work
hard if we are going to achieve our goals.  There is so much for us to
do.  We've set ourselves the task of restoring Asatru to it's former
place as a mainstream faith and by doing so reinvigorating our society
and culture.  We can't do this by sitting on our virtues, we need to
make them an active part of our behavior.  Industry also refers to
simple hard work in our daily vocations, done with care and pride.

Here's a few concrete examples.  If you are reading this and don't
have a kindred, why not?  Stop reading now.  Go and place ads in the
appropriate local stores, get your name on the Ring of Troth, Wyrd
Network, or Asatru Alliance networking lists, and with other Pagan
groups.  Put on a workshop.  Ok, now you're back to reading and you
don't agree with what I'm saying here?  Well, be industrious!  Write
your own articles and arguments.  Write a letter to the editor and
suggest this material be bannedbetter that than passivity.  Get the
blood moving and go out and do it.  That's how it gets done.  The Gods
do not favor the lazy.

The same holds true for our non-religious lives.  As Asatruar we
should offer a good example as industrious people who add to whatever
we're involved in rather than take from it.  We should be the ones the
business we work in can't do without and the ones who always seem to
be able to get things done.  When people think of Asatru, they should
think of people who are competent and who offer something to the
world.

This doesn't just apply to vocational work, but to the entire way we
live our lives.  It is just as much a mentality.  The Vikings were
vital people.  They lived each day to its fullest and didn't wring
their hands in doubt or hesitation.  We should put the same attitude
forward in all that we do whether it is our usual vocation, devotion
to the Gods, or leisure time.

Self Reliance

Industry brings us directly to the virtue of Self-Reliance, which is
important both in practical and traditional terms.  Going back to the
general notion of this article, we are dealing with a form of morality
that is largely self-imposed and thus requires self-reliance.  We rely
on ourselves to administer our own morality.

Traditionally, our folkways have always honored the ability of a man
or woman to make their own way in the world and not to lean on others
for their physical needs.  This is one of the ways in which several
virtues reinforce and support each other.  Hospitality cannot function
if people are not responsible enough to exercise discipline and take
care of themselves.  It's for those that strive and fail or need
assistance that hospitality is intended, not for the idle who simply
won't take care of themselves.

In terms of our relationships with the Gods, self-reliance is also
very important.  If we wish the Gods to offer us their blessings and
gifts, we must make ourselves worthy of themand the Gods are most
pleased with someone who stands on their own two feet.  This is one of
the reasons for the Asatru rule that we do not kneel to the Gods
3297

during our ceremonies.  By standing we acknowledge our relationship as
striving and fulfilled people looking for comradeship and a
relationship, rather than acting as scraelings looking for a handout
from on high.  It takes very little for a God to attract a follower,
if worship simply means getting on the gravy train.  We, as Asatruar,
are people who can make our own way in the world, but who choose to
seek a relationship with the Gods.

In mundane terms being self-reliant is a simple way to allow ourselves
the ability to live as we wish to.  In simple economic terms, if one
has enough money in the bank one doesn't need to worry as much about
being fired due to religious discrimination.  We can look a bigot in
the face and tell him just where he can put it.  It's also nice to
have something in the bank to lay down as a retainer on a good lawyer
so we can take appropriate action.

On the other side of this is self-reliance in the sense of Henry David
Thoreau, who advocated a simple lifestyle that freed one from the
temptations of materialism.  Again, here we are able to live as we
wish with those things that are truly important.  Religious people
from all faiths have found that adjusting ones material desires to
match one's ability to meet them leaves one open for a closer
relationship with deity and a more fulfilling life.  While our
ancestors were great collectors of gold goodies, they didn't lust for
possessions in and of themselves, but for what they stood for and
could do for them.  In fact, the greatest thing that could be said of
a Lord was that he was a good Ring Giver.

Being self-reliant also means taking responsibility for ones life.
It's not just about refusing a welfare check or not lobbying for a tax
exemption, but also refusing to blame ones failures on religious
intolerance, the patriarchy, or an unfair system.  The system may, in
fact, be unfair, but it's our own responsibility to deal with it.

In societal terms, we have become much too dependent on other people
for our own good.  As individuals we look to the government or to
others to solve our problems and as a society we borrow billions from
our descendants to pay for today's excesses.  Most problems in this
world could be solved if people just paid their own way as they went.

The final virtue is Perseverance which I think most appropriate
because it is the one that we most need to keep in mind in our living
of the other values.  Our religion teaches us that the world is an
imperfect place, and nothing comes easy.  We need to continue to seek
after that which we desire.  In this imperfect world there are no free
lunches or easy accomplishmentsespecially in the subjects we have set
before ourselves.  If we truly wish to build an Asatru community that
people will hold up as an example of what committed people can do,
then we must persevere through the hardships that building our
religion is going to entail.  We must be willing to continue on when
we are pushed back.  If one loses a job for ones religion, the answer
is not to go back and hide, but to continue until one finds a vocation
where one can more forward and live as an Asatruar should.

Finally we must persevere when we simply fail.  If one's kindred falls
apart because of internal strife, one should go back and start over.
Pick up the pieces and continue on.  If nobody had done this after the
disintegration of the Asatru Free Assembly, this would probably never
3298

have been written.  We must be willing to continue in the hard work of
making our religion strongnot just when it is convenient and easy to
do so, but when it gets hard, inconvenient, or just plain boring.  To
accomplish without striving is to do little, but to persevere and
finally accomplish a hard fought goal brings great honor.

      We offer to thy Blade that which
      we no longer need.

      Mine the scourge, and mine the kiss;
      The five-point star of love and bliss -
      Here I charge you, with this sign.

Priest: Here ye the words of the Dark Lady; we who of old was called

                          Prayers to Brighid 
These are some prayers to Brighid that I adapted from prayers to the
Irish Saint Brigid.  Comments are welcome.
3303

"KINDLING THE FIRE"

This morning, as I kindle the flame upon my hearth, I pray that the
flame of Brighid may burn in my soul, and the souls of all I meet today.

I pray that no envy and malice, no hatred or fear, may smother the
flame.

I pray that indifference and apathy, comtempt and pride, may not pour
like cold water on the flame.

Instead, may the spark of Brighid light the love in my soul, that it may
burn brightly through the day.

And may I warm those that are lonely, whose hearts are cold and
lifeless, so that all may know the comfort of Brighid's love.


"COVERING THE FIRE"

Brighid, preserve the fire, as You preserve us all.

Brighid, may its warmth remain in our midst, as You are always among us.

Brighid, may it rise to life in the morning, as You raise us to life.

************************************************************************
              _Banishing And Sealing Ritual For The Home_

To be performed during at the New Moon, but may be performed at any time
in need.

You will need a new white Candle (any size with holder), small bowls for
Water and Salt, and a large bowl of water as well, and the censer and an
appropriate incense.  (Choose one that brings to your mind qualities you
wish to have in your home.)


Banishing Ritual:

Meditate for a few moments on the task ahead; then make a brief
invocation to the Goddess and the God, asking for Their Aid and Power in
the Work you will do.

Light the white candle in its holder, and charcoal in the censer (or an
incense stick may be used instead).

Consecrate Water and Salt in the usual way.

Consecrate the water in the bowl in the same manner, but do not add
Salt; place this bowl in the center of the room.

Take the consecrated Water, elevate it to North, and say,

        "In the name of (Goddess) and (God)
         I banish with Water and Earth."

Sprinkle the Water lightly widdershins around the perimeter of the room.

Bless the incense, then elevate the censer (or incense stick) to North,
and say,

        "In the name of (Goddess) and (God)
         I banish with Fire and Air."

Cense the perimeter of the room widdershins.

Take the Candle and cast a Banishing Earth Pentagram at North.  (Draw
the Pentagram with the censer or incense stick, starting from the bottom
left point up to the top point, and so forth.)  As you cast the
Pentagram say,

        "With this Sign I banish ye, foul shades of the (Quarter)!
         Let this home be freed of your baneful influences!"

Then go widdershins around the perimeter of the room, casting a
Banishing Pentagram at each Quarter beginning at the West and ending
back at North, repeating the above at each Quarter.  (Do not repeat it
again at North.)

Now turn and face the center of the room, where the bowl of water sits.
3305

With your hands, draw any negative energy or vibrations remaining, and
cast them into the water in the bowl by flicking or snapping your
fingers at it.  Repeat this action until you are satisfied the room is
cleansed.  Do not touch the water in the bowl, as it is being filled
with the negative forces you are eliminating.

Move the consecrated Water, the Salt, the Incense, the Candle, and
the bowl of water (being careful not to spill it) into each room in
your home and repeat this ritual.

After banishing every room in the home (including bathroom, closets,
pantry, etc.) you have finished.  Empty the large bowl of water into
running water (a sink or toilet will do).  Wash the bowl thoroughly
with cold water, scrubbing with some of the consecrated Salt.


Sealing Ritual:

Take all the Elemental substances used in the Banishing Ritual (Salt,
consecrated Water, wax drippings from the Candle, and ashes from the
Incense) and mix them into a paste.

Using your forefinger, use the mixture to draw an Invoking Fire
Pentagram at each opening leading outside the home (the doors and the
windows - and even the water pipes, if you should feel the need) while
concentrating on the Intention of protecting your home from outside
influences.  (Draw the Pentagram from the top point to the bottom right,
and so forth.  Form the Star so that it is point up, or point out, as
appropriate.)  You may make two Stars at each opening if you wish - one
on the sill or threshold, and the other on the door or window itself.

Remember that Intent is the key to success in this, as in all magickal
operations; going through the motions without Will brings no results.

                       The Center Point (Celtic) 
                              By: Airmid


The methods that I use involve putting oneself in the center of the
Three Realms, constructed as a triskele. The first is a movement
meditation that I call "The Center Point." It involves both movement and
a breathing pattern used to time the movement. Breathing is, ideally,
timed to the heartbeat. Three each beat is one count. Breathing pattern
is to inhale for 3, hold for 1, exhale for 3, hold for 1.

Movement is slow, rhythmic and deliberate. Each movement has its own
meaning.

Start standing erect, arms relaxed at your sides.

Close your eyes and relax. Clear your mind, concentrating on your
breathing, and listening to your heart beat. Breathe in and out in the
3-1-3-1 pattern three times as you allow yourself to relax.

As you breathe in the fourth time, raise your hands from your sides and
cover your heart with your palms, one over the other -- you are at the
center of the world.

3306

Exhale, moving smoothly to one knee, placing your palms on the ground in
front of you -- you stand firmly upon the Land.

Inhale as you rise to your feet. As you stand, move your hands behind
you as far back as you can comfortably reach at waist or hip height.
Your hands should be cupped as though you are holding liquid.

Breathe out, moving your hands in an arc around you until they meet in
front of you at about the level of your navel -- the Sea always
surrounds you.

Breathing in, move your hands back to your sides, holding them slightly
away from your hips with your palms flat, facing forward and your
fingers spread open.

Exhale as you raise your arms above you in a smooth curve over your head
until the tips of your thumbs and index fingers touch --the Sky spreads
itself above you.

Inhale again, lowering your hands in front of you until they are once
again cupped over your heart -- you are at the center of the Three
Realms.

                               The Coven 
                          By: Julia Phillips

Greetings All!

This article was written by me several years ago, but I thought it might
be of interest here, as it discusses several issues relevant to modern
Witches. Any thought or feedback most welcome! Please remember, that
although the historical stuff is pretty general, the other parts of the
article are my own ideas, and not necessarily applicable outside of my
own tradition :)

                          Covens and Witches

In 1662, Isobel Gowdie of Auldearne made four separate confessions of
being a Witch, and in the process, gave the word "Coven" to the world.
3307

Although there is no other historical evidence for this word, it has
proven to be one of the most lasting facets of Witchcraft - ask anyone
today what Witches do, and the answer will almost certainly include the
fact that they meet in groups, called "Covens".

So given that a number of modern Witches do, in fact, either run, or
belong to, a Coven - just what is its purpose in 20th (and 21st) century
Western Civilisation? Why has this word of such dubious historical
veracity survived over three hundred years? Is there a place in our
modern world for a social group which, as far as we know, occurred only
in 17th century Scotland?

The very fact of its survival for over three hundred years argues that
there is a place for such a group. In my own case, I have been a member
of, and run, Covens of Witches for a number of years, and it is a social
model which fits extremely well within modern society.

The structure of a coven varies, but generally has one or two leaders,
and a number of members of varying levels of experience. In a sense, the
modern Coven has replaced the tribal family, and its members often
fulfill familial roles, which are no longer available to them in the
family in which they were born.

Some researchers have commented that many modern Witches come from a
background which was disrupted; i.e., did not provide a safe family
environment during their formative years. As I know a great many Witches
for whom this was not the case, I think this is only a partial reason,
and only for some people.

Humanity itself seems to be inherently tribal; any common bond between
people will generally result in the creation cults or sub-cultures,
where those of a like-mind will bond together. They will evolve their
own social order (generally hierarchical), have their own common
language, and often are identifiable by their demeanour and appearance.

Witches gather together in Covens for very much the same sorts of
reasons; we are apart from general society by virtue of our beliefs and
practices. Meeting with others who think and feel similarly to ourselves
gives us the opportunity to share ideas and skills, as well as being
able to practise our Craft.

A modern Coven provides a family-style environment, where the "Elders"
can, by virtue of their experience, give encouragement, support, and
advice to those seek to learn about Witchcraft. As with all families,
Covens have very unique and individual ways of approaching this. Just as
no two families are the same, neither are any two Covens.

Some Covens are run by people with an academic bent, and as would be the
case in any family, this characterises the way in which their "children"
are brought up. Other groups are oriented towards a more simple
approach, and the oral traditions play an important role in the way in
which the Coven is structured.  Some combine the these two approaches,
and the variations upon the basic themes are endless.

For any "family" to exist harmoniously, everyone within the group must
feel a part of the group, and wish to learn and grow within that group
environment.  With a path such as Witchcraft, with its emphasis upon
personal growth and development, it is likely that individuals who may
3307

at one time have been happy within their family group, will change, and
wish to move away. This is a perfectly natural process, and the wise
coven leaders will send those people off with their love and blessing.
Trying to keep them would be like trying to keep your sons and daughters
tied to your apron strings forever!

Ultimately, and despite the popularity of the word "coven", I do believe
that most Witches are solitary in nature, and will generally spend at
least part of their lives without being a member of, or running, a
coven. I think the inward exploration during these periods is vital to
self-development, just as we believe it is important to encourage
social-awareness in children. However, I also believe that at some stage
it is important to learn the practices of Witchcraft from another
person; to be an apprentice, if you will; because the act of passing
knowledge from one person to another cannot be replicated by books,
correspondence courses, or be self-taught. This may seem an almost
impossible task to some people, but as all the magical traditions teach:
when the student is ready, the teacher will appear! What's more, it's
true!

               Group Ethics Rules:  Opening Suggestions! 
                               By: Raven



Too often I had seen the Craft used as a personal power-trip, or with a
disregard for the effects on others.  This time it happened in my home.

I introduced two guests, acquaintances of mine, to each other.  One was
interested in learning about the Craft; the other offered to teach him.
The would-be teacher went on about his skills, describing the would-be
student's aura and psychic shields; leaned back in his chair, said,
"I really shouldn't do this, I really shouldn't" -- then leaned forward
and, with no warning or other preliminary, SLICED the student's shields
"open" (as he said), leaving the student feeling naked and exposed.

To prove a point, I suppose, but what point I can't guess.

I was outraged.  Guests in my home are not to be abused -- by anyone.
Even to a complete materialist, it would be clear that the student had
had his personal space invaded, his emotional consolation removed, with
no informed consent involved, and with no feeling of other protection.

I already knew the would-be teacher himself was taught by people of
no great concern for ethics.  His was chiefly a fault of poor training,
added to which he had never stopped to think that "occult" dealings with
people might involve the same ethical issues as "mundane" dealings.

One of the several outcomes of that event was that I wrote the following
guidelines for those two specific people, and suggested (NOT ordered)
that they adopt these -- if they did still decide to work together.
After that, well, several other people did express an interest.


Note!  This was written as a PROPOSAL; no-one has enacted it as a LAW.
The hope is for it to be used by, and among, those who like the ideas.
3308

(Really, all it does is put the concept of "Harm ye none" in practice.)

                         RULES OF THE CIRCLE

    THE RULES OF INFORMED CONSENT:

1.  Tell everyone participating what to expect, before the circle is
    closed or anything else begins.
2.  Give everyone participating the chance to say NO and to withdraw,
    before the circle is closed or anything else begins -- and then
    respect that decision.
3.  Be open, honest, and fair:  spring no surprises, trip no traps;
    NEVER use what you learn or do in circle to manipulate or compel
    any other person, or diminish anyone's dignity and free will.

    THE RULES OF PRIVACY:

4.  Encourage people not to wander in and out of any session between
    its beginning and ending, or cross the circle while it is closed.
5.  Protect every session from interruption by (or intrusion on) any
    outsiders -- by closed or locked doors, a fence, or some other
    clear marking outside the circle.
6.  While proceedings may not be secret, they ARE always private; keep
    silent about who and what you see or hear in circle, unless you
    have each other participant's specific consent.

    THE RULES OF SHIELDING:

7.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS close the circle and raise your wards before
    beginning, or continuing after a break.
8.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS dismiss your wards and open the circle after ending,
    or to allow passage across the circle.
9.  Conduct yourself with mutual respect and due courtesy, without
    malice or ill will toward anyone, or else ask that the circle be
    opened and that you be dismissed from the session.



                              COVENANT

    THE TEACHER PROMISES THE STUDENT:

1.  I will abide by the Rules of the Circle.
2.  I will ask from you no more than you can give.
3.  I will not expect you to read my mind.
4.  I will not hide from you my limits or gaps in knowledge; if I just
    don't know, I'll tell you so.
5.  I will explain, to the best of my ability, not only what to do and
    how, but also why.
6.  I will not push you beyond your ability or willingness to proceed.
7.  I realize that I may be tempted to become dominating, a "leader" --
    and I will do my best to resist this temptation.
8.  Because I received from others without payment, I will give to you
    without payment.
9.  As I can, I will learn from you in turn.

    THE STUDENT PROMISES THE TEACHER:

3309

1.  I will abide by the Rules of the Circle.
2.  I will ask from you no more than you can give.
3.  I will not expect you to read my mind.
4.  If I have questions about what you show me, I will ask you.
5.  If I fail to understand anything, I will mention it.
6.  If I feel unready to proceed, I will tell you.
7.  I realize that I may be tempted to become dependent, a "follower" --
    and I will do my best to resist this temptation.
8.  Because I receive from you without payment, I will give to others
    without payment.
9.  As I can, I will teach you in turn.

       A CIRCLE IS NOT A LINE:  IT HAS NO BEGINNING AND NO END.
       A CIRCLE IS NOT A PYRAMID:  IT HAS NO TOP AND NO BOTTOM.
   A CIRCLE IS NOT AN ASTERISK:  IT IS NOT RUN FROM JUST ONE POINT.

                   Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede 
                 By: David Piper, Sat 21 May 94 12:16

                    Part I:  What Sayeth The Rede?
                         =====================

The "archaically worded" construction "An it harm none, do what ye
will," rendered into modern English is literally, "if it doesn't harm
anyone, do what you want."

Many modern Wiccans "reverse" the construction, however, taking the
first part and putting it after the second to read: "Do what ye will an
it harm none," or in modern English "Do what you want if it doesn't harm
anyone."

Many people give the word "an" or "if" a value of "so long as" - which
is acceptable substitution, because it doesn't alter the meaning of the
Rede itself.  However they then proceed to read "so long as" as "only
if," and that is *completely different*, because the Rede has ceased to
be a "wise counsel" [anyone checked the meaning of "rede" in the
dictionary lately?] and become an injunction: prohibitive commandment,
rather than permissive advice.

In other words, the original archaic construction actually says "if it
is not going to hurt anyone, it is ok to do" - this is *not* the same as
"if it hurts anyone it is *not* ok to do."

What is the significance of the change?  A larger one than you might
see, at first glance.

The "actual construction Rede," or AC Rede, says it is ok to do
something that won't harm anyone, but it *does not say anything* about
those things which do cause harm, except to set an ethical standard of
harmlessness as the criteria to judge by.

The "modern reconstruction Rede" or MR Rede, explicitly says that any
and all actions that cause harm are forbidden.

The two constructions do *not* mean the same thing at all.  And it
should be obvious that this has implications on our thinking, and
discussions of the possibility of "obeying" the Rede.

Most of you will have heard or read, as I have, people saying the Rede
is something to strive to live by, even though mundane reality makes it
very difficult, if not impossible, to do so to the letter.  *This is
only true of the MR Rede, not the AC Rede!*  As examples, they cite
situations such as self-defense; *this violates the MR Rede*.  Period. 
But it does *not* violate the AC Rede.  Period.

Earlier, I stated that the AC Rede does not rule on actions that do
cause harm - and this is true.  It only rules on those actions which do
not, by saying that they are acceptable.  This is relevant to "victi-
mless crimes" for example - civil "crimes" may in fact be "ethical," by
the judgment of the AC Rede.

What the AC Rede *does* do, in terms of actions that cause harm, is
state an ethical value by which an individual must judge the results of
her/his actions before acting.  In other words, by stating that a 
3311

harmless action is ethical, the AC Rede sets harmlessness as the
criteria for evaluation.  Acting to prevent greater harm - but in the
process causing lesser harm - may then be ethical, if there is no
harmless, or more harmless, method of preventing that greater harm -
because *not* acting to prevent harm is to *cause* it, by an act of
*omission* rather than *commission*.

In short the difference between the AC Rede, and the MR Rede, is that
the AC Rede is a perfectly-obeyable ethical standard, but the MR Rede is
not, as so many people have pointed out.  Do we take as our ethical
standard a "counsel" which *can* be obeyed, or one which *necessitates
rationalizing in some instances*?  Which is truer to the Wicca, and to
the *real* Rede?

      "rede: n. [Middle English rede < Old English raed < base of
raedan, to interpret] [archaic]  1. counsel; advice  2. a plan; scheme
           3. a story; tale  4. an interpretation"
                                (from Webster's New World Dictionary)


Part II: "Do good, an it be safe..."  (from the Ordains)
         ===========================

The MR Rede is the most common interpretation in Wicca today; so much
so, that not only do many Wiccans not realize there's a difference in
the two constructions, but they *deny* it when it is pointed out to
them, holding firmly to the MR Rede as what the original has always
meant.

At first the change of language was only an attempt to bring the
language up from archaic, to modern English; but in doing so - especial-
ly with the public relations campaign, to convince people that Wiccans
are "not black magick/not devil worship/not evil nasty curse-casters"
the "harmlessness" aspect of the Rede was stressed, over the personal
responsibility aspect.  And in essence Wiccans became the victims of
their own PR campaign.

An additional result is the injunction that one may never work magick
for others, even to heal, without their knowledge and consent.  Of
course, we are allowed by this injunction to ask "Can I pray for you?"
as a means of obtaining the consent.  From "a love spell aimed at one
particular person is unethical because it violates their will only to
serve our lust" we've moved to an extreme: to the prohibitive injunction
against ever doing any magick for another without permission, since it
violates their free will.  Does anyone *really* believe the Gods will
judge them ill, for attempting to heal someone?

What of the case of an unconscious accident victim and family unavail-
able to ask - are we forbidden to work?  No, of course we're not - but
we *do* have to accept the karmic consequences of such acts.  Do you
really think that a neurotic who uses an illness as a crutch wouldn't be
better healed of that neurosis as well as the illness?  Of course that
may call up some karma if the person isn't strong enough to give up that
crutch yet.  Once again the real criteria is *personal responsibility*
and consideration of the consequences of one's actions *before* one acts
rather than the "thou shalt not" prohibitive commandment.

There is however another reason for the "prohibitive form" of these 
3312

redes - one which has some validity.  The teacher bears a karmic respon-
sibility for the student.  There was a group whose teaching was, "No
magick may be done for another, even to heal, without their consent; any
exceptions may be decided only by the High Priestess and the High
Priest."  The point of this is that a student is not yet experienced
enough, not yet wise enough (since wisdom is the harvest we reap of our
experience and knowledge), to have that kind of decision, and the
resulting karmic burden, left to rest fully upon her/his shoulders -
hence, some teachers and some Trads do not allow neophytes to have
responsibility for that kind of decision-making.

It is far better, however, to teach a student the essential importance
of personal responsibility, the need to look ahead for possible
consequences before they act, than to lay "thou shalt not's" upon them
despite Wicca's insistance that we have none.

I received a comment about the last sentence in part I, paragraph 3,
that said "Ack!  Welcome to the One Wiccan Commandment!  Any 'thou shalt
nots' lurking around?"  Food for thought, my fellow Wiccans!  Food for
thought!

                          Charge of the God 1 
                             By: Siobhan 
                          Tue 12 Jul 94 10:33

Here's something I picked up recently. The writer felt that there should
be a Charge of the God to go with The Charge of the Goddess.
                *****
     Listen the the words of the Great Father, who of old was called
Osiris, Adonis, Zeus, Thor, Pan, Cernunnos, Herne, Lugh and by may other
names:
    "My Law is Harmony with all things.  Mine is the secret that opens
the gates of life and mine is the dish of salt of the earth that is the
body of Cernunnos that is the eternal circle of rebirth.  I give the
knowledge of life everlasting, and beyond death I give the promise of
regeneration and renewal.  I am the sacrifice, the father of all things,
and my protection blankets the earth."
     Hear the words of the dancing God, the music of whose laughter
stirs the winds, whose voice calls the seasons:
    "I who am the Lord of the Hunt and the Power of the Light, sun among
the clouds and the secret of the flame, I call upon your bodies to arise
and come unto me.  For I am the flesh of the earth and all it's beings.
Thru me all things must die and with me are reborn.  Let my worship be
in the body that sings, for behold all acts of willing sacrifice are my
rituals.  Let there be desire and fear, anger and weakness, joy and
peace, awe and longing within you.  For these too are part of the
mysteries found within yourself, within me, all beginnings have endings,
and all endings have beginnings."
So Mote It BE!

                          Charge of the God 2 
                             By: Siobhan 
                          Tue 12 Jul 94 10:33

This is the second Charge of the God I have.
                ****

THE CHARGE OF THE GOD

Listen to the words of the God, who is the son, brother, lover, and
consort of the Lady:

I am the fleet deer in the forest, I am the beach which receives the
waves, I am the sun which warms the earth. I am the Lord of the
Spiral Dance of Life, Death and Rebirth, the gentle reaper, the
Winter stag and the Spring fawn. All things are of me, for I am of
the Goddess, opposite, yet not opposing. I bring birth forth from the
womb that is a tomb, for I am the seed which fertilizes. I am
abundant Life, for I am the grain that grows and I am death, the
harvest in the Fall. And I am rebirth after darkness, for I am the
seed that springs forth anew.

I am fertility, the spreader of Life, and I am the Lord of Death,
which adds value to life.

I am the Guardian of the gate between Life and Death. I am King of
the Underworld, where no living being may venture, but I am also
the King of Rebirth, turning the tomb into a womb.

3314

I bring love and strength, peace and passion, hope and joy, for I am
the gentle lover in the night.

All that I am comes from the Great Mother, the Divine Star
Goddess, who is Mother of us all.

                **********

Feel free to use this one as is, or to adapt it in whatever way feels
right to you.

                         For a Few Myths More 
                               by Aries

"...Aries shows us how modern images (albeit set in 19th century
America)..." Julia, Web of Wyrd No. 7. 

For me, that "albeit" sounded like a gauntlet being slapped down. Can we
show the presence of myth in films other than Westerns? We don't plan to
go on in great detail, but we suspect that what we're trying to get
across is the suggestion that maybe "The Mythic" is not the stories or
rituals, but the substrate out of which our tales and trials grow.

When  we talk about myths we are really referring to ancienct stories,
and not every ancient tale grew out of "The Mythic". More than enough
were for entertainment, propaganda, satire or pornography _ to see
everything that is old as also being venerable is to fall into the
Confuscian Heresy. In much the same way our modern literature/film
culture produces works serving as varying purposes as moral tales, epic
adventures, pulp and hardcore porn, but also produces work that grows
direct from "The Mythic".

In the rubric of science, "The Mythic" can be seen as being non-local;
it stands outside of space-time, being here, there and everywhere; now,
then, and everywhen. Our tales do not grow out of the ancient tales/myt-
hs, but draw afresh from the same wells as they did (do/will?).

In the printed media a good many SF novels are  based on the inner/und-
erground journey; all that Phillip K Dick and Edmund Cooper wrote seemed
based on this theme, in the same way "Metropolis" is of the "descent"
type story.  One of the great advantages of film is the way it can make
the sensations of the "descent" seem "real"; possibly by a species of
autohypnosis into a state that Robert Anton Wilson refers to as virtual
reality in his book, Cosmic Trigger 2. For us other examples of the
descent theme are Orson Welles' films; Touch of Evil and The Trial
(based on Kafka's book), giving a long shot of the journey.

The classic "Casablanca" we suggest is the story of the "descent" from
a viewpoint inside the underworld itself. That Casablanca is the place
of death is always suggested by the comment that Rick makes to Elsa when
she says that Victor Lazlo will die in Casablanca; "What of it? I'm
going to die in Casablanca. It's a good place for it." Full of refugees
(lost souls). Rick exists in his own emotional limbo awaiting the
descent of his own Inanna to set him free.

"Apocalypse Now" and the Conrad novel it is based on, "Heart of
Darkness", gives a great example of the same story set at both ends of
the century; the parallel of the inner and outer journey, especially as
Conrad went through his inner journey whilst writing the book, and
Francis Ford Copolla and crew went through theirs while making the film.
I would strongly suggest that "The Mythic" emerges into our lives first
and formost; through tales we make sense of the patterns, and warn those
who follow on from us.

Another great advantage of film is its ability to show us inside the
underworld in such a way that we may lose track of where the boundaries
lay, and become uncertain of what is real and what is illusion. If the
previous films can be seen as "descent" themes, the following, we
suggest, can be called "Chapel Perilous" themes. In "The Maltese Falcon"
3316

we have the characters chasing the elusive bird, crossing and double-cr-
ossing each other, unconcerned by anything but possession of the
miraculous object, which we discover at the very end is nothing but;
"The stuff that dreams are made of".

With "The House of Games" _ Mamet's six year-old cult movie _ we enter
the image of the labyrinthe, a subterranean night world of confidence
tricksters, who lead a lady psychiatrist along until she, and us (the
viewer) have problems distinguishing between what is real and what
isn't, until it all becomes part of the game.

That is the nature of "Chapel Perilous", its existence can be denied, we
can believe we're somewhere else (watching a movie?), but all the time
we're trapped in it, unable to discern what is really going on.
Another cult movie that gives a beautiful experience of Chapel Perilous
is Orson Welles' film "F for Fake", except this time we are the targets
of the con. A documentary film about two fakers, itself really a clever
montage of existing film clips put together to give the impression of a
series of interviews. At some point the film moves into the realm of
total fantasy, and the beauty of it is that we don't notice _ that is
the Chapel Perilous experience. From here it is logical to move onto the
ascent, or what could be called the "Promethean" theme. The film
"Frankenstein" is the classic promethean film, but is full of timid,
anti-Luciferan morality; i.e. to steal the "fire" from the gods
instantly incurrs punishment; as a myth, that is no longer useful to us.

All of the above examples are tales based in the twentieth century. For
a promethean theme we feel we should be looking forward; "2001 A Space
Odyssey" is wonderfully symbolic in that it is based in the first year
of the next millenium. There are four stages in the film: the first is
"The Dawn of Man", taking place in prehistoric Earth, where "the slab"
appears _ the promeathean gift, but what is the gift? fire? tool use?
weapon use? the ability to kill? We would suggest that it is the gift of
imagination; the apre man looks at the bone and "sees" a weapon; he has
the ability to manipulate images in his mind.

In the film the image cuts instantly to a space craft on its way to the
Moon.  This journey between the worlds we feel signifies that we have
entered mythic space. In the next stage of the film, "The Moon", we meet
"the slab" again, where it dispenses its next gift, the awareness of
something beyond. In Qabbalistic terms we have moved from Malkuth to
Yesod; the following stage of the film, "Journey to Jupiter", has us
ascending the sephiroth to Chesed.

On the approach to Jupiter, Dave has to disconnect the higher functions
of the computer, Hal. We would suggest this can represent a distrust of
reason; a return to child-like ways, or a stepping away from the
constraints of language.  As Hal closes down, it is language that
deteriorates; i.e. it is language that constructs the world we perceive.
So to go into the infinite beyond, to take the Next Step, we have to go
beyond language, hence all the descriptions of mystical experiences end
up sounding like gibberish.

For the final stage of the film, "Jupiter and beyond to Infinity", we
have the leap across the Abyss to the Supernals; Chokmah, Binah, Kether.
Because language fails us at this point, Kubrick relies solely on the
visual image; the sequence seems baffling, but we wonder if he is trying
to explain something that is also suggested by Ken Wilber in his book,
3317

"The Atman Project"; i.e., we evolve by changing how we translate the
incoming information of our senses. We go from looking through to
looking at each developmental stage. For most of us, we construct the
world by looking through a semantic framework or grid; when we transcend
this stage, we will be able to look at our semantic structure.  Likewise
in the film, Dave sees the next stage from outside and then becomes it:
the outsider, the astronaut, the urbane man, the old man on the death
bed, and finally rebirth as the Star Child. Or as Crowley puts it in
"Magick" when describing the grade of Adeptus (Exemptus); "Completes in
perfection all these matters. He then either (a) becomes a Brother of
the Left Hand Path or, (b) is stripped of all his attainments and of
himself as well, even his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of the
Abyss, who having transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the
womb of its mother."

So we contend that "The Mythic" is everywhere, everywhen, and despite
our cultural estrangement from myths, "The Mythic" still emerges through
our media in many guises, which includes, but is not exclusive to,
Western movies.

                            Handfast Ritual 

This is adapted from "Magical Rites from the Crystal Well" by Ed Fitch
and is a combination of their handfast ritual and american indian
ceremonial prelude. I'll skip over the consecration as it is a standard
one and get straight to the ritual itself.  We had a Priestess only, so
this was written with that in mind but could easily be adapted for a
Priest and Priestess.

At this time and in this place
Do we call upon the Spirits of the Land
As well as the Mighty Ones of the Skies.
We call upon the Gods of our own distant past
From lands far away.
We call upon the Gods of our spiritual brethren
Who once called this place
Their own.
Witness and rejoyce with us in this moment
As love is affirmed.

__Groom's name__ and __Bride's name__ step forward
Stand before the Gods and those who witness on Earth

__Groom's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this woman
Will you pledge your love through all that may come
As long as love shall last?

<Groom replies: I so pledge>

__Bride's name__, if it is your wish to become one with this man
Will you pledge your love through all that may come As long as love
shall last?


<Bride replies: I so pledge>

Does any say nay?

As the Gods and the Old Ones are witness
With those of us present now,
I now proclaim you man and wife1
Thus are thy hands fasted...
The Two are now One,
This work is done
And joy is yet begun!


There is also a portion for the rings using a wand that was left out of
ours but is normally placed immediately after the vows and is as
follows...

The rings are placed upon the wand before the ritual and the wand upon
the altar.  (This is written for bot Priest and Priestess present)

     The priest picks up the wand and holds one end before him in his
right hand, the priestess likewise holds the other end in her left hand.

Place your right hands
3319

Over this wand...
And your rings...
His hand over hers.

Above you are the stars
Below you are the stones
As time passes, remember...
e a star should your love burn brightly,
Like the earth should your love be firm.
Be free in giving of affection and of warmth.
Have no fear, and let not the ways or words
Of the unenlightened give you unease.
For the Gods are with you,
Now and always!

The rings are exchanged during the vows.

 Handfasting (Celtic) 

This is a copy of a Celtic handfasting I found in the book _Finn Mac
Cool_  by Morgan Llywelyn.

Bride and Groom repeat the following together:

You cannot possess me for I belong to myself.  But while we both wish
it, I give you that which is mine to give.  You cannot command me for I
am a free person.  But I shall serve you in those ways you require and
the honeycomb will taste sweeter coming from my hand.  I pledge to you
that yours will be the name I cry aloud in the night, and the eyes into
which I smile in the morning.  I pledge to you the first bite from my
meat and the first drink from my cup.  I pledge to you my living and my
dying, each equally in your care.  I shall be a shield for your back,
and you for mine.  I shall not slander you, nor you me. I shall honor
you above all others, and when we quarrel, we shall do so in private and
tell no strangers our grievances.  This is my wedding vow to you.  This
is the marriage of equals.

The Priest or Priestess says:
These promises you make by the sun and the moon, by fire and water, by
day and night, by land and sea.  With these vows you swear, by the God
and Goddess, to be full partners, each to the other.  If one drops the
load, the other will pick it up.  If one is a discredit to the other,
his own honor will be forfeit, generation upon generation, until he
repairs that which was damaged and finds that which was lost.  Should
you fail to keep the oath you pledge today, the elements themselves will
reach out and destroy you.
