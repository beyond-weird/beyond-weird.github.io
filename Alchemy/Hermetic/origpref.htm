<P><FONT SIZE="5">I</FONT>t would be unjust to double, most
gentle reader, that of all the arts invented for the use
of life by the reason of man, that of <I>Alchemy</I> is the
most noble and glorious. For all philosophers exclaim, as it
were, with one voice, albeit in many languages, that this art
is not only true, but (after the Divine Law by which our souls
are saved) the best and most magnificent gift imposed on man
by God; and that it should therefore be invesigated with all
zeal and with the greatest pains.  But as good wine needs no
praise, so neither does this art need a herald; for its truth
is undoubted, and its utility in human life universally acknowledged,
and shewn forth, not only in the Art of Medicine, in Pharmacy,
and many other sciences, but especially in the Art of Transmuting
Metals, is so clearly and perspicuously demonstrated, that it in
no way requires to be adorned by the splendour of oratory, or
tricked out with the device of language.  I will not enlarge
upon the blessing which the elaboration of minerals and metals
has bestowed on our race. I merely point it out, but refrain
from discussing it at length.  Different men devote themselves
to the study of this science from different motives.
The philosopher is impelled by the love of truth, and the
thirst after wisdom.  He delights in knowledge for its own sake.
He welcomes every elegant and copious treatise on the marvels
of Nature, to the glory of Almighty God. This is a sufficiently
generous reward for a philosopher. He has it at his command
the most effectual means of becoming rich, if he would only
use them. But he is fired by the love of philosophy, and does
not care for the mocking grandeur of fortune. So thought the Sages
of the Saracens, Egyptians, Arabs, and Persians; for when they
were oppressed by tyrants, and violently driven into exile,
they protected and supported themselves by means of their
Art, and, though protected and supported themselves by means
of their Art, and, through their knowledge of the transmutation
of metals, they had at their command, not only sufficient to
live upon, but all the comforts and pomp of life, and thus
practically demonstrated that they could obtain all that gold
and silver could give. Concerning this true transmutation of
metals, which is accomplished only by the Elixer or Stone of
the Philosophers, we here propose to speak.  This art is set
forth in a series of treatises by different authors, which appeared
several years ago, and, like the present volume, was entitled
&quot;A Museum of Hermes.&quot;  But many writers having
discussed the subject, and treated it from various points of
view (so that one writes more clearly than the other, and each
throws light on the other's meaning), some of my friends, who
are adepts in this Art, urged me to add to the former collection
certain treatises supplementary of those already given.
For though that former collection contained the most select
writings on the subject, yet is was not as complete as it
might have been, nor was it calculated to furnish to the
reader in full measure the eagerly expected fruit of his study.
To this wish of my friends I have all the more readily submitted,
because its fulfilment must redound to the advantage of the
student.  I have, therefore, enlarged the collection with
several most select treatises, and caused it to be adorned
with many engravings. I was most strongly impelled to undertake
this task by the consideration, viz., that thorugh fraudulent
machinations of greedy imposters many false, so-called
chemical treatises have been put forward, in which there is not
a single spark of truth, and that very many have been, and
still are being deceived by them. These dupes, by reading this
book, in which the Magistry of the Stone is most clearly and
plainly set forth, and into which no error or forgery has
been admitted, will be secured against the imposture of that
wicked and mercenary band who delight in fraud. For in this
book all errors are shewn up and dispelled. For this reason
I confidently offer this volume to the sons of knowledge,
in order that while they may think upon and investigate
the secret workings of Nature, they may obtain from it nothing
but the truth, and gain a clear insight into the very nature of
things.  In this alone consists the perfection of the entire
most Holy Art of Philosophy.  Only let them go forward along
the Royal Road which Nature prescribes in all her operations.
As to the rest, I heartily bet the friends of this Art to give
a kindly reception to the present volume, and when, through the
Will of God, by constant labour, they have put ashore in the
desired haven of philosophy, after the nature of philosophers
to exclude all that are unworthy from the knowledge thereof,
and, being mindful of charity towards their needy neighbor
in the fear of God (without any vain ostentation), to sing
eternal praises to the Good and Thrice Great God for this
Wonderful and Divine Gift (without any abuse thereof) in
a silent and devoutly joyful heart.
