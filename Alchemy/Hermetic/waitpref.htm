<P><FONT SIZE="5">T</FONT>HE HERMETIC MUSEUM RESTORED AND ENLARGED was published in
Latin in Frankfort, in the year 1678, and, as the title
implies, it was an enlarged form of an anterior work, which,
appearing in 1625, is more scarce, but, intrinsically, of less value.
Its design was apparently to supply in a compact form a representative
collection of the more brief and less ancient alchemical writers;
in this respect, it may be regarded as a supplement to those
large storehouses of Hermetic learning as the <I>Theatrum Chemicum</I>,
and that scarcely less colossal of Mangetus, the <I>Bibliotheca
Chemica Curiosa</I>, which are largely concerned with the cream
of the archaic literature, with the works of Gerber and the
adepts of the school of Arabia, with the writings attributed
to Hermes, with those of Raymond Lully, Arnold de Villa Nova,
Bernard Trevisan, and others.</P>
<P>THE HERMETIC MUSEUM would also seem to represent a distinctive
school in Alchemy, not altogether committed to certain modes
and terminology which derived most of their prestige from the
past, and sufficiently enigmatical as it was, still inclined
to be less obscure and misleading than was the habit of the
older masters. For it belonged to a period which had inherited
a bitter experience of the failures, impostures, and misery
surrounding the <I>Magnum Opus</I> and its mystical quest,
which was weary of unequipped experiment, weary of wandering
&quot;multipliers&quot;, and pretentious &quot;bellows-blowers,&quot;
while it was just being awakened to the conviction that if
Alchemy were true at all, it was not be be learned from
books, or, at least, from any books which had hitherto
been written on the subject. Running through all the tracts
which are comprised in the following volumes, the reader will
recognize traces of a central claim in alchemical intitiation--
that the secrets, whatever they were, must be understood as
the property of a college of adepts, pretending to have
subsisted from time almost immemorial, and revealing themselves
to the select and few, while the literature, large as it is,
appears chiefly as an instrument of intercommunication between
those who knew.  At the same time, it may also be regarded as
a sign and omen to the likely seeker, an advertisement that
there was a mystery, and that he must go further who would
unravel it.</P>
<P>While the treatises now translated are for the most part
anonymous, as befits veiled masters, the literary reader
will remember the name of John de Meung connects the allegorical
&quot;Romance of the Rose&quot; with the parables of Alchemy;
Flamel will be familiar to all Hermetic students as the most
celebrated of the French adepts; the saintly name of Basil
Valentine, investigator of the properties of antimony, will not
even now be unhonoured by the chemist; Eireneaus Philalethes,
equally revered and unknown by all devout Spagyrites, is supposed
to have been the most lucid of hierorphants, and the
&quot;Open Entrance&quot; to be the clearest of all his works.
Helevetius was an illustrious chemist, and Michael Maier is a person
of some repute in the Rosicrucian controversy.  Micheal Sendivogius
was an uninstructed disciple of Alexander Seton, and the
&quot;New Chemical Light,&quot; which he published and claimed as
his own, was really the work of his master, who has been
called the chief martyr of Alchemy. It may be added in this
connection that some critics have cast doubt upon the genuine
nature of the &quot;Testament of John Cremer,&quot; and it
is true that the annals of Westminster do not include an
abbot of that name.</P>
<P>It should be understood that the writer of this brief note
must not be accredited with the translation which it seeks
to introduce. That is the work of a gentleman who is said
to have had a life-long acquaintance with alchemical literature;
it has been subjected to a searching revision at the hands
of the present editor, who may himself be permitted to
claim some experience in Hermetic antiquities; the version
as it stands does not uncreditably represent both the spirit
and the sense of the original without the original's prolixity.
While affording to the modern student of secret doctrines
an unique opportunity for acquiring in English a collection of
alchemical writers, ths edition of the HERMETIC MUSEUM also
claims consideration at the hands of the historian as a
contribution of real value to the early history of chemistry.</P>
