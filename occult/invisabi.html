              THE CREEPY-CRAWL CHAMELEON RITE
               A Method of Not Being Noticed

             Introduction: An Occulting Primer


Fear and Self-Confidence.

    "Getting the Fear" brings on a hyper awareness of one's
outside environment (and a dramatic heightening of all
one's physical and psychic senses) when raised to a pitch
nearing terror by survival instincts.  This is the
definition of pathic paranoia.  The purpose of deliberately
inducing fear in oneself is to increase awareness and,
although somewhat unpredictably, speed in performing acts
of an embarrassing or "not quite legal" sort.  This method,
however, when it is the only one used, tends to attract
notice rather than detract from it.

    Self-Confidence, when intentionally induced into an
unlikely situation, brings non-awareness, enabling the
operator to continue unhampered by fear of divulgence.
This is effectively used in acts of a self-righteous sort,
in which the operator sees the act as a "god-given right"
despite societal taboos to the contrary.  An artificial
superiority complex is one such example of a self-induced
confidence trick to hide unpreparedness, inability,
embarrassment and so on.

    There is also the art of "Blending in" that often
includes both of these, and is the primary result of both
when attempting to become invisible.  The act of inspiring
confusion in mob situations is included in the art of
blending in, as it makes any and all actions by a single or
well orchestrated group seem of little importance compared
to the actions of a confused and/or panicking mob.
Therefore, one or all of these factors must be included in
any operation whose purpose is to cast a glamour of
invisibility on any person, place, or thing.

    The following ritual outline can be used in any
situation which hostile discovery might be the result.
Invisibility should not be the only objective therefore,
and so a cloak of silence is also implied.  Smell of course
is fairly simple to conceal, and is used to advantage by
covering up or removing it.  The aim of the ritual then is
complete invisibility, to include ultimately psychic
manipulation of the surrounding area of operation; creating
a warp in the fabric of perception to hide an unaccustomed
weave.  As with any modus operandi, practice makes perfect,
and therefore operators are advised to adapt the ritual to
fit any circumstance.  The Creepy Crawl Chameleon Rite is
best performed by a group whilst a single individual speaks
the enochian invocation.
              THE CREEPY-CRAWL CHAMELEON RITE



Preliminary:
A few moments of silence and relaxed awareness of one's
surroundings.  After a suitable period (when one is calm
and relaxed), the operators begin imagining everything they
see, hear, etc. as a potential threat.  This should last
only long enough that high-pitched fear overtakes them.


Statement of Intent:
"It is my/our will to cast a glamour of negative perception
on all that should come into my/our sphere of influence."


Invocation of Invisibility:
To be spoken aloud by a single operant whilst all operators
slowly spin, widdershins, with eyes wide open and arms
outstretched.  Operators visualize a sphere of dense black,
smoky darkness enveloping the area surrounding them as the
enochian invocation is delivered.

(Visible only by will, I blind and make deaf all others who
 may see or hear me.  A darkness shall cover them like that
 at the bottom of the ocean, and they shall leave
 immediately.  Forgetfulness will envelope their minds and
 anxiety grip their hearts should they come to interrupt us
 in our work.)

The operators then see the smoky darkness dissipate as all
that is within the working area begins to "fold".

The unfolding process is completed by laughter whilst
spinning quickly deosil (to the right), decreasing
speed to a full stop.
