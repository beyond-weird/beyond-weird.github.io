 The Key of Solomon
 PREFATORY NOTE TO BOOK TWO.
This work of Solomon is divided into Two Books. I n the first thou mayest see and
know how to avoid errors in Experiments, Operations, and in the Spirits theirselves.
In th e second th ou art t aught in w hat manner Magical Arts may b e re duced to th e
proposed object and end. 
 It is for this reason tha t thou shouldst t ake great heed and care that th is Key of
Secrets fall not into the hands of the foolish, the stupid, and the ignorant. For he who
is the possessor hereof, an d who availeth himself hereof according to the ordinances
herein c ontained, will not only be able to reduce the Magical Arts herein unto their
propose d end, but will, e ven if h e fi ndet h certain er rors herein, be abl e to cor rect
them. 
 Any Ar t or O peration of this kind w ill n ot be able to attain its end, unles s the
Master of the Art, or Exorcist, shall have this work completely in his power, that is to
say, unless he thoroughly understand it, for without this he will never attain the effect
of any operation. 
 For this reason I earnestly pray and conjure the person into whose hands this Key
of Secrets may fall, neither to communicate it, nor to make any one a partaker in this
knowledge, i f h e be n ot fai thful , nor cap able of keeping a secr et, nor expert i n the
Arts. And I most humbly entreat the possessor of t his, by the Ineffable Name of God
in Four Letters, YOD, HE, VAU, HE, and by the Name ADONAI, and by all the other
Most High and Holy Names of God, that he values this work as dearly as his own soul,
and that he makes no foolish or ignorant man a partaker therein.

 Book Two 
 Chapter I 
 AT What Hour after the Preparation of All Things Necessary, We Should 
 Bring the Exercise of the Art to Perfection 
The Days and Hours have already been treated of, in general, in the First Book. It is 
now necessar y to notic e in partic ular at what h our accomplishment and per fectio n 
should be given to the Arts, all things necessary having been previously prepared. 
 Should it then happen that thou hast u nder taken any secret operation for con- 
versing with or conjuring Spirits, in which the day and the hour are not marked, thou 
shalt put it in execut ion on the days and hours of Mercur y, at the sixteenth or twenty- 
third hour, but it will be still better at the eighth, which is the third of the same night, 
which is ca lled a nd means bef ore the morning , for then thou shalt be able to put in 
practice all the Arts and Operations which should he performed, according as it shall 
plea se thee by day or b y night, provided that they h ave been prepared at the hours 
suitable to them, as hath been already said. But when neither hour nor time of opera- 
tion or invocation is specified, it is then much better to perform these experiments at 
night , seei ng that i t is more easy to the Spir its t o appear i n the peaceful silence of 
night than d ur ing the day. And thou should st inviolabl y obser ve, that wishing t o 
invoke the Spirits, either by day or by night, it is necessary that it sho uld be done in a 
plac e hidden, r emoved, secret, conven ient, an d proper for such Art, wh ere no man 
frequenteth or inhabiteth, as we shall rela te more fully in its place. 
 If then thou shouldst operate touching anything which hath been stolen, in what- 
ever way it be performed and whatever way it may have been prepared, it is necessary 
to practice it on the days and hours of the Moon, being if possible in her increase, and 
from the first unto the eighth hour of the day. 
 But if it be by night, then it should be at the fif th or at the third hour; but it is bet-
te r by day t han by the n ight, for t he li ght justifie th them, a nd maketh them much 
more fit for publication. But if the Operations be regarding Invisibility, they should 
be put in practice at the first, second, and third hours of Mars by day. But if by night, 
until the third hour. If they be O perations of seeking love, grace, or favor, they should 
be performed until the e ighth hour of the same day, commencing wi th the first hour 
of the S un; and from the first h our of Venus unto the f irst h our of the sa me d ay of 
Venus. 
 As for Operations of destruction and desolati on, we should practice and put them 
into ex ecut ion on the day of Sa turn at the fi rst hour, or rat her at the ei g hth or fi f- 
teenth of the day; and from the first until the eighth hour of the night. 
 Experiments of games, ra illery, deceit, illusion, and invisibilit y, ought to be done 
at the first hour of Venus, and at the eighth ho ur of the day; but by night at the third 
and at the seventh. 
 At all time s of pra ctic ing and putting in to e xecut ion M agical Arts , the Moon 
should be increasing in light, and in an equal number of degrees with the Sun; an d it

 The Key of Solomon
is much better from the first quar ter to the Opposition, and the Moon should be in a
fiery Sign, and notably in that of the Ram or of the Lion.
 Therefore, to execute these Experiments in any manner w hatsoever, it should be
done when the Moon is clear, and when she is increasing in light.
 In order to put in execution those of Invisibility after ever ything is properly pre-
pared, the Moon should be i n the Sign of the Fishes, in the hour s prop er and fi tting,
and she should be increasing in lig ht.
 For experiments of seeking love and favor, in whatever way it may be desired, they
will succeed , provided that they have been prepared at the proper hours, and that the
Moon be increasing in light and in the Sign of the Twins.
 S o e x act a pre par at ion o f da ys a nd h ours is no t ne c es sar y f or th ose w ho are
Adepts in the Art, but it is extremely necessary for apprentices and beg inners, seeing
that those w ho have been little or not at all instructed herein, and who only begin to
apply themselves to th is Art, do not have as much fa ith in th e e xp eriments as those
who are adepts therein, and who have practiced them. But as regards beginners, they
should always have the days and hours w ell dis posed a nd a ppropriate unto the Ar t.
And the wise should only obser ve the precepts of the Art which are necessary, and in
observing the other solemnities necessary they will operate with a perfect assurance.
 It is, nevertheless, n ecessary to take care that when thou shalt have prepared any
exp eriment thys elf for the da ys and hours o rdained, that it s hould be per formed in
clear, serene, mild, and pleasant weather, without any great tempest or agitation of the
air, which should not be t rouble d by winds. For when thou shalt have conjured any
Spirits in any ar t or experiment, they will no t come when the Air is troubled or agi-
tate d by winds, seeing that Spirits have n either flesh nor bones, and are create d of
different substances. 
 Some are created from Water. 
 Others from Wind, unto which they are like.
 Some from Earth. 
 Some from Clouds. 
 Others from Solar Vapors. 
 Other s from the keen ness an d strength of Fi re; and when they ar e invoked or
summoned, they come always with great noise, and with the terrible nature of fire.
 When the Sp irits wh ich are creat ed of water are invoked, they come w ith gr eat
rains, thunder, hail, lightning, thunder-bolts, and the like.
 When the Spirits which are created of Clouds are invoked, they come with gr eat
deformity, in a horrible form, to strike fear into the invocator, and with an exceeding
great noise. 
 Others wh ich are formed from wi nd appear like thereunto and with exce eding
swift motion, and whensoever those which are creat ed from Beauty appear, they will
show themselves in a fa ir and agreeable form; moreover, when soever thou shalt call
the Spirits created from Air, they will come with a kind of gentle breeze.
 When the Spirits which are created from the Vapors of the Sun are invoked, they
come under a very beautiful and excellent form, but filled with pride, vanity, and con-

ceit. They are clever, whence it comes that these last are all specified by SOLOMON in 
his b ook o f orname nt, or o f beauty. Th ey show great ostentation a nd v ainglory i n 
their dress , an d they rejoice i n man y or namen ts; the boast of possess ing mundane 
beauty, and all sor ts of ornaments and decorations. Thou shalt only invoke them in 
serene, mild, and pleasant weather. 
 The Sp irits which are created of Fire reside i n the east, those created of Wind i n 
the south. 
 Note then th at it will be much better to pe rform the experiments or operations in 
the direction of the East, putting everything necessar y in practice towards that point. 
 But for all other operations or extraordinary experiments, and for those of love, 
they will be much more efficacious directed towards the north. 
 Take heed further, that every time that thou performest any experiment, to reduce 
it unto perfection w ith the requisite solemnities, thou shalt recommence the former 
ex per ime nt if in te rr up ted t her ein, w itho ut th e pr ep a r at io n of hour s o r o ther
solemnities. 
 If by chance i t should hap pen that having perf ormed an ex per iment with due 
observance of days, hours, and requisite solemnities, thou shalt find it unsuccessful, it 
must b e in s ome manner false, ill-arranged and de fec tive, a nd th ou must assuredly 
have failed in some matter; for if thou doest ill in one single point, these experiments 
or these Ar ts will not be verified. 
 Thus upon th is Chap ter depende th th is whole Key of Ar ts, Ex perim ents, and 
Operations, and although every solemnity be rightly obser ved, no experiment will be 
verified, unless thou canst penetrate the meaning of this Chapter.

 The Key of Solomon
 Chapter II.
In What Manner the Master of the Art Should Keep, Rule, And Govern Him-
 self.
He who wisheth to apply himself unto so great and so difficult a Science should have
his mind free from all business, and from all extraneous ideas of whatever nature they
may be. 
 He s hould th en th or oug hly e xa mine th e A rt or Ope ra tio n w hic h he s hould
undertake, and write it regularly out on paper, particularly set aside for that purpose,
with the ap prop riat e co njur ations and exorci sms. If there be anything to mark or
write d own, it should be performed in the manner specified regarding the paper, ink,
and p en. He sh ou ld a lso o bser ve at wh at day an d at wha t h our t his Ex p eriment
should be undertaken, and what things are necessary to prepare for it, what should be
added, and what can be dispensed with. 
 The which ma tte rs being pr epared, it is ne cessar y f or thee to search o ut and
arrange some fitting place wherein the Magical Art and its Experiments can be put in
practice. All these things being thus arranged and disposed, let the Master of the Art
go into a proper and fitting place, or into his Cabinet or Se cret Chamber if it be con-
venien t fo r t he p ur p ose, a nd h e c an t her e dis pos e an d s et i n o rde r t he wh ol e
oper ation; or he can use any other convenient secret place for the purpose, provided
that no one knoweth where it is, and that no man can see him when there.
 After this he must strip himself entirely naked, and let him have a bath ready pre-
pared, wherein is water exorcised, after the manner which we shall describe, so that he
may bathe and purify himself therein from the crown of his head unto the sole of his
foot, saying: 
 O Lord ADON AI, who hast formed me Thine unworthy ser vant in Thine Image
and resemblance of vile and of abject earth; deign to bless and to sanctify this Water,
so that it may be for the health and purification of my soul, and of my body, so that
no foolishness or deceitfulness may therein in any way have place.
 O M ost Powerful a nd I neffable G od, Who ma de st Thy pe ople pa ss dr ys hod
through the Red Sea wh en they cam e up out of t he La nd of E gypt, gr ant unto me
grace that I may be purified and regenerated from all my past sins by this Water, that
so no uncleanness may appear upon me in Thy Presence.
 After this thou shalt entirely immerse thyself in the water, and thou shalt dry thy-
self w ith a towel of clean w hite line n, and the n tho u shalt put u pon thy f lesh the
garments of p ure white linen whereof we shall speak hereafter.
 Hereafter, for three days at least, thou shalt abstain from all idle, vain, and impure
reasonings, and from every kind of impurity and sin, as will be show n in the Chapter
of fast and of vigil. Each day shalt thou recite the following prayer, at least once in the
morning , twice about no on, thrice in th e a fternoon, four times in th e evening, and
five times before lying down to sleep; this shalt thou do on the three ensuing days:

livest and reignest unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen. 
 Thes e three days having passed, t hou m ust h ave al l things i n readiness, as hath 
been said, and after this a day appointed and set apart. It will be necessar y for thee to 
wait for the hour in which thou shouldst commence the Operation; but when once it 
shall be commenced at this hour, thou shalt be able to continue it unto the end, seeing 
that it deriveth its force and virtue from its beginning, which extendeth to and spread- 
eth ov er the s ucceed ing hours, so t hat the Master o f the Ar t wi ll be en abl ed t o 
complete his work so as to arrive at the desired result.

 The Key of Solomon
 Chapter III.
How the Companions or Disciples of the Master of the Art Ought to Regu-
 late and Govern Themselves.
When the Master of the Art wisheth to put in practice any Operation or Experiment,
especially one of importance, he should first consider of what Companions he should
avail himself. This is the reason why in ever y Operation whose Experience should be
carried out in the Circle, it is well to have three Compa nions. And if he cannot have
Companions, he should at least have with him a faithful and attached dog. But if it be
absolutely necessary for him to have Companions, these Companions should be obli-
gated and bound by oath to do all that the Master shall order or prescribe them, and
they should study, observe, and carefully retain, and be attentive unto all which they
shall hear. For those who shall act otherwise shall suffer and endure many pains and
labors, and run into many dangers, which the Spirits will cause and procure for them,
and for this cause sometimes they shall even die.
 The D isci ples t hen, bei ng well an d thoroug hly instructed, an d for t if ied with a
wise an d understanding heart, the Master shall t a ke exorcised Water, an d he shall
enter with his D isciples i nto a secr et place p urified an d clean, wh er e h e must str ip
them entirely naked: after this, let him pour exorcised water upon their heads, which
he should cause to flow from the crown of their head unto the sole of their foot, so as
to bathe them entirely therewith; and while bathing them thus, he should say:–
 Be ye regenerate, cleansed, and purified, in the Name of the Ineffable, Great, and
Eternal God, from a ll your iniq uit ies, and may th e virtue of the Most High descend
upon you and abide with you always, so that ye may have the power and strength to
accomplish the desires of your hear t. Amen.
 After this let the Dis ciples robe themselves as the Master hath done, and fa st like
him for three days, repea ting the same prayer ; let them act like him, and in the work
let them implicitly follow and obey him in all things.
 But if the Master o f the Ar t wisheth to have a dog for h is Companio n, h e must
bathe him thoroughly with the e xorcised water in the same manner as the Disc iples,
and let him perf ume him with t he odors and inc ense of Art, and l et him repea t th e
follow ing Conjuration over him: 
 I conjure the e, O thou Creature, being a Dog, by Him Who hath created the e, I
bathe and I perfume thee in the Name of the Most High, Most Power ful, a nd Eterna l
God, so that thou maye st be my true Companio n in t his o per ation, and that th ou
mayest he also my faithful friend in whatsoever Operation I may hereafter perform.
 But if he wishet h to have for his companion a little boy or girl, which will be still
better, he mus t ordain the m a s he ha th ordained the d og; and he must pare and cut
the nails of their hands and of their feet, saying:
 I conjure thee, O t hou Creature, bei ng a young girl (or boy), by the Most High
God, the Father of all Creatures, by the Father ADONAI ELOHIM, and by the Father
Elion, that thou shalt have neither will nor powe r to hide from me anything, nor yet
Page 88 



--------------------------------------- 9

 Book Two 
to keep back from me the truth in all w hich I shall de mand of the e, a nd that thou be 
obedient and faithful unto me. Amen. 
 Let him pu r ify, c leanse, and wash this yo ung chil d anew, with the Water of Ar t, 
saying: 
 Be thou regenerate, cleansed, and purified, so that the Spirits may neither harm 
thee nor abide in thee. Amen. 
 Then perfume the child with odours as above. 
 When the companions shall be thus ordained and disposed, the Master shalt be 
able to operate i n suret y t ogether with them, every time that it shall please him; and 
he shall perform his oper ation happily, and shall attain his end. 
 But for the safe t y bo th of sou l and of bo dy, the Mast er and the Co mpanions 
should have the Pentacles before their breasts, consecrated, and covered with a si lken 
veil, and perfume d with the p roper fum igations. B y the w hich be ing assur ed and 
encouraged, the y may enter into the matter without fear or terror, a nd they shall be 
exempt a nd free from all perils and da ngers, provided that the y obey the comma nds 
of the Master and do all that he ordain them. If they shall act thus, all things shall go 
according unto their desires. 
 All being thu s arrang ed, the Master should take he ed tha t His Disciples are per- 
fectly instructed in those things which they have to perform. 
 These Companions or Disciples should be three in number, without including the 
Master. They may also be of the number of five, of seven, or of nine; but so that they 
ever implicitly obey the orders of t heir Master; for thus only shall all things come to a 
successful issue.

 The Key of Solomon
 Chapter IV.
 Concerning the Fasting, Care, and Things to be Observed.
When the Master of the Art shall wis h to perform his operations, having previously
arranged all things w hich it is necessary to observe and practise; from the first day of
the Experiment, it is absolutely necessar y to ordain and to prescribe care and observa-
tion, to ab stain f rom al l things un lawf ul, and from ev ery kind of impiety, impurity,
w ick edness, or immodesty, as we ll of body as of s oul ; as, for exa mp le, eat ing and
drinking superabundantly, and all sorts of vain words, buffooneries, slanders, calum-
nies, and other useless discourse; but instead to do good deeds, speak honestly, keep a
strict decency in all things, never lose sight of modesty in walking, in conversation, in
eating a nd drinkin g, a nd in a ll th ing s; th e which should he pr incipa lly do ne a nd
obser ved for nine d ays, before the commencement of the Operat ion. The Disciples
shou ld do the sam e, and shou ld e qually put i n pr ac tice all thi ng s n ecess ar y to be
observed, i f they wish to make use of all these operations and experiments.
 But b efore the c ommencement o f the work , it is absolutely ne cessa ry th at the
Master w ith his Disciples repeat the following Conjuration once in the morning, and
twice in the evening: 
 THE CONJURATION.
 O Lord God Alm ighty, b e propit ious u nto me a miserable sinne r, f or I am not
worthy to raise mine e yes unto heaven , because of t he iniquity of m y sins and the
multitude of my faults. O pitying and merciful Father, who wouldest not the death of
a si nner b ut rather that he should turn from his w ick edness an d live, O God have
mercy upon me and pardon all my sins; for I unworthy entreat Thee, O Father of all
Creatures, Thou Who ar t full of mercy an d of compassi on, by Thy gr eat goo dness,
that Thou deign to grant u nto me power to see and know these Spirits which I desire
to behold and to make to appear before me and to accomplish my will. Through Thee
Who art Conqueror, and who ar t Blessed unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen.
 O Lord God the Father Eternal, Who art seated up on the Kerubim and the S era-
phim, Who lookest upon E arth an d up on Sea; un to Thee d o I raise my ha nds an d
implore thine aid alon e, Thou w ho alon e ar t the acc om pli sh ment of good wor ks,
Thou Who givest rest unto those who labo ur, Who humblest the proud, who ar t the
Author of Life and the Destroyer of Death; Thou ar t our rest, Thou art the Protector
of those who invoke Th ee; pr otect, guard, and defend me in this matter, and in this
enterprise which I propose to carry o ut, O T hou who livest, reignest, and abidest unto
the Eternal Ages. Amen. 
 During the three la st days bef ore the commencement of this act ion, thou shalt
content thyself with only eating fasting diet, and that only once in the day; and it will
be be tter still if thou only partakest of bread and water. Thou shalt also abstain from
every impure thing; reci ting the prayer above written. And on the last day, when thou
shalt wish to commence the Operation, thou shalt remain all day without eating, and
Page 90 



--------------------------------------- 11

 Book Two 
later on thou shalt go into a s ecret place, wh ere thou sh alt conf ess all thy sins unto 
God w ith a contrite heart. The Dis ciples also, together with the Master, shall recite 
the same Confession with a low but dis tinct voice, as hath b een already said in th e 
First Book. 
 This h aving b een done thrice with a devout, pure, and contrite heart, in a pla ce 
withdraw n from men, cleansed, and pure, where thou canst not be s een, ta king t he 
water and the hyssop, thou shalt say: 
 Purify me, O Lord, with hyssop, and I shall be pure; wash me and I shall be whiter 
than snow. 
 After this, bathe thyself with the exorcised water, and clot he thyself again with the 
consecrated garme nt which thou h ast taken off; cense thyself, and surround th yself 
w it h od ou r s , as w i ll be t o l d far t he r on , wh en we sp eak of p e r f um es an d 
suffumigations. 
 The which being done, thou shalt go unto the ordained place w ith thy Compan- 
ions, and all thing s being prepared, thou sha lt make the Circle, as hath been already 
said, w ith all ot her necessar y ce remonies; then shalt thou co mmence to invoke the 
Spirits by the Exorcisms; thou shalt also repeat anew the foregoing Confession as hath 
been already said in the First Book. After which, in sign of amendment and of repen- 
tance, each shall mutually kiss the other. 
 Mar k well, tha t u p to t his po int, the Dis ciples should do the same things as th e 
Master. 
 Let the Master now give his commands unto his Disciples, and pursue t he course 
of the Experiment, and work with all diligence to bring it unto perfection.

 Chapter V.
 Concerning the Baths, and How They Are To Be Arranged.
The Bath is necessary for all Magical and Necromantic Arts; wherefore, if thou wish-
est to pe rf orm a ny e xperim ent or o peratio n, having a rranged all thin gs ne cessary
thereun to according to the prop er days and hours, thou sha lt go unto a river or run-
ning stream, or thou sha lt have warm water ready in some large vessel or tub in thy
secret cabinet, and w hile disrobing thyself of thy raiment thou shalt repeat the follow-
ing Psalms: Psalms xiv. or liii; xxvii; liv.; lxxxi; cv.
 And wh en the Master shall be en tirely d isrobed l et him en ter into the water or
into the Bath, and let him say: 
 THE EXORCISM OF THE WATER.
 I exorcise Thee, O Creature of water, by Him who hath created thee and gathered
thee together into one place so that the dry land appeared, that thou uncover all the
deceits of the Enemy, and that thou cast out from thee all the impurities and unclean-
nesses of the Spirits of the World of Phantasm, so they may harm me not, through the
virtue of God almighty who liveth and reigneth unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen.
 Then shalt thou begin to wash thyself thoroughly in the Bath, saying:
 MER TAL IA , M US A L IA , D OPH AL IA , ONE MA LI A, Z I TA NS E IA, GO L D-
AP HAIR A, D EDU LS AIRA, GHEVIA LAIR A, GHE MINAI RA , GE GR OP HE R A,

HUZNOTH, ASTACHOTH, TZABAOTH, ADONAI, AGLA, ON, EL, TETRAGRAM-
MATON, SHEMA, AREISON, ANAPHAXETON, SEGILATON, PRIMEUMATON.
 All the which Names tho u shalt repeat twice or thrice, until thou art completely
washed an d clean , an d wh en thou ar t perfectly pure thou shal t quit the B ath, an d
sprinkle thyself with exorcised water, in the manner described later on, and thou shalt
say: 
 Pur ge me, O Lord, with h yssop, and I sh all be cle an; wa sh m e, and I shall b e
whiter than snow. 
 Whilst again clothing thyself, tho u sha lt recite the f ollowing Psalms: Ps alms cii.;
li.; iv.; xxx.; cxix., Mem., v. 97.; cxiv.; cxxvi., cxxxix.
 After which thou shalt recite the following prayer:
 PRAYER
 EL Strong and Wonder ful , I bl ess T hee, I ad ore Thee, I g lor ify Thee. I invoke
Thee, I render Thee thanks from this Bath, so that this Water may be able to cast from
me al l i mpurity and concupiscence of h ear t, through Thee, O H oly AD ONAI; a nd
may I accomplish all things through Thee Who livest and reignest unto the Ages of the
Ages. Amen.

 The Ble ssing of the Fa the r A lmighty b e up on this C reature of Sa lt, and let a ll 
malig nity and hindr ance be cast forth hencefrom, and l et all good enter herein, for 
without Thee man cannot live, wherefore I bless thee and invoke thee, that thou may- 
est aid me. 
 Then thou shalt recite over the Salt, Psalm ciii. 
 Then taking the grains of the exorcised Salt thou shalt cast them into the aforesaid 
Bath; and thou shalt again disrobe thyself, pronouncing the following words: 
 IMANE L, ARN AMON, IM ATO, MEMEON, RE CTACON, M UBOII, PALTEL- 
LO N, D ECAI ON, YA MENTON, YARO N, TATO NON, VAPHORON, GARD ON, 
EXISTON, ZAGVERON, MOMERTON, ZARMESITON, TILEION, TIXMION. 
 After this thou shalt enter a second tim e into the Bath and recite Psalms civ. and 
lxxxi. 
 Then thou shalt quit the Bath and clothe thyself as before in linen garments clean 
and white, and o ver them thou shalt put the g arments, of which we shall s peak in the 
proper Chapter, and thus clothed thou shalt go to finish thy work. 
 The Disciples should wash themselves in like ma nner, and with like solemnities.

 Of The Garments And Shoes Of The Art.
The exterior habiliments wh ich the Master o f the A rt should wear ough t to be o f
linen, as well as those which he weareth beneath them; and if he hat h the means they
should b e of Silk. If they be of linen the thread of which th ey a re made s hould have
been spun by a young maiden. 
 The characters shown in Figure 55 should be embroidered on the breast with the
needle of Art in red silk. 
 Figures 55 and 56.
 The s hoe s sh ould a lso be White, up on t he wh ich the charac ters in Figure 56
should be traced in the same way. 
 The sho es or b oot s sho uld be made of white lea ther, on the w hich sho uld be
marked the Signs and Characters of Art. These shoes should be made during the days
of fast an d abstinence, namely, during the nine days set apart before the beginning of
the Operation, during which the necessary instruments also should be prepared, pol-
ished, brightened, and cleaned. 
 Besides this, the Master of the Ar t should have a C rown made of Virgin Parch-
ment paper, upon the which should be written these four Names: YOD, HE, VAU, HE,
in front; ADONAI behind; EL on the right; and ELOHIM on the left. (See Figure 57.)
These na mes should be w r it ten with the ink an d pen of t he Ar t, wher eof we shall
speak in the proper Chapter. The Disciples should also each have a Crown of Virgin
paper whereon these Divine symbols should be marked in scarlet. (See Figure 58.)

 Take heed also that in clothing thyself with these aforesaid habiliments, that thou 
recite these Psalms: Psalms xv.; cxxxi.; cxxxvii.; cxvii.; lxvii.; lxviii.; and cxxvii. 
 After this perfume the Vestments by burning Incense, and sprinkle them with the 
water and hyssop of the Art. 
 But when the Master and His Disciples shall commence to robe themselves after 
the first Psalm, an d before co ntinuing w ith the ot hers, he should pron oun ce t hese 
words: 
 AMOR, AMATOR , A MIDES, I DEODANIACH, PA MOR, P LAIOR, ANITOR ; 
through the merits of th ese h oly Angels will I robe and indue myself w ith th e Vest-

which I ardently wish, through Thee, O Most Holy ADONAI, W hose Kingdom and

 Chapter VII.
 Of Places Wherein We May Conveniently Execute The Experiments And 
 Operations Of The Art
 The places best fitted for exercising and accomplishing Magical Arts and Opera-
tions are those which are concealed, removed and separated from the habitations of
men. Wherefore desolate and uninhabited regi ons are most appropriate, such as t he
borders of lakes, for ests, dark and obscure place s, old and dese rted houses, whither
ra rely a nd scar ce ever men do come, mo unta in , caves , c averns , g rotto s, gard ens,
orchards; but best of all are cross-roads, and where four roads meet, during the depth
and silence of nig ht. But if thou canst no t conveniently go unto any of these places,
thy h ouse, and even thine own chamber, or indeed , any place, provided it hath been
purified and consecrated with the necessary ceremonies, will be found fit and conve-
nient for the convocation and assembling of the Spirits.
 These Arts or Operations should be carried out at the prescribed time, but if there
be no time specially appointed it will be always better to perform them at night, which
is the most fit and proper time for the Oper ations of Necromancy ; this is also a sy m-
bol th at it is just and rig ht to hide th em from the sight of th e foolish, the ignorant,
and the profane. 
 But when thou shalt h ave se lected a place fitting, t hou mayest perf orm thine
experiments by day or by night. It should be spacious, clear, and bounded on all sides
by hedges, shrubs, trees, or walls. Thou shalt thyself cleanse it thoroughly an d render
it neat and pure, and while doing this thou shalt recite Psalms ii.; lxvii.; and liv.
 After this thou shalt perfume it with the odours and suffumigation of the Art, and
shalt sprinkle it with the wa ter and the hyssop; and after this thou mayest in this place
make all the necessary preparations for an Operation.
 But when, later on, thou shalt go unto this place, to complete and accomplish the
operation, thou shalt repeat on the way thither the following Prayer in a low and dis-
tinct voice: 
 THE PRAY ER.
 ZAZAII, ZAMAII, PUIDAMON Most Powerful, SEDON Most Strong. EL, YOD
HE VAU HE, IAH, AGLA, assist me an unworthy sinner who have had the boldness to
pronounce t hese Holy N ame s w hich no ma n should name and in voke s ave in very
great d anger. Theref or have I recours e unto these Most Holy Names, b eing i n great
peril both o f soul and of body. Pardon me if I have sinned in any manner, for I trust
in Thy protection alone, especially on this journey.
 Let the Master as he goeth sprinkle the path with the water and hyssop of the Art,
while each of hi s Dis ciples sh all rep eat i n a low voi ce t he Pr ayer w hich we have
enjoined for the days of fasting and preparation.
 Furthermore, let the Master a ppoint his Disciples to carry the th ings necessary for
the Art.

 But if the re be more Disciples present, the Master shall distribute the things for 
each to carry, according to their number. 
 When th ey shall have arrived a t th e place, and all things being disposed in their 
proper order, the Master shall take the Knife or other convenient consecrated Magical 
implemen t of St eel, wherewith to for m the Ci rcle of Ar t wh ich h e i ntends t o con-

 First let him have a Trumpet made of new wood, on the one side of which shall be 
w ritten in Hebrew wi th the pen and i nk of the Art these Na mes of God , E LOHIM 
GIBOR, ELOHIM TZABAOTH (see Figure 59); and on the other side these characters 
(see Figure 60). 
 Having entered into the Circle to perform the Experiment, he s hould sound his 
Trump et towa rds t he f our q uar ters o f the U niver se, fi r st towar ds t he E a st, t hen
toward s the South, then towards the West, and lastly towards the North. Then let him 
say: 
 Hear ye, and be ye ready, in whatever part of the Universe ye may be, to obey the 
Voice of God the Mighty One, and the Names of the Creator. We let you know by this 
signal an d soun d that ye will be convoked hither, w herefor e hold y e yoursel ves i n 
readiness to obey our commands. 
 This being done let the Master complete his work, renew the Circle, and make the

 Of The Formation Of The Circle. 
Having chosen a place for preparing and constructing the Circle, and all things nec- 
es sary bei ng prepared for the p erfect ion o f the Op erat ions, t ake thou t he S ick le or
Scimitar of Art and stick it into the centre of the place where the Circle is to be made; 
then take a cord of nine feet in length, fasten one end thereof unto the Sickle and with 
the other end trace out the circumference of the Circle, which may be marked either 
with the Sword or with the Knife with the Black hilt. Then within the Circle mark out 
four regions, n amely, towards the East, West, South, and North, wherein place Sym- 
bols; a nd b eyond th e limits of th is C ircle de s crib e with the Cons ecra ted Knif e or 
Sword anot her Circle, but leaving an open space therein towards the Nor th w hereby 
thou mayest enter and depart beyond the Circle o f Art. Beyond this again thou shalt 
describe another Circle at a foot distance with the aforesaid Instrument, yet ever leav- 
ing ther ein an open space f or e ntr ance and egress cor responding to the open space 
already left in the other. Beyond this again make another Circle at another foot dis- 
tance, and beyond these two Circles, which are beyond the Circle of Art yet upon the 
same Centre, thou shalt describe Pentagrams with the Symbols and Names of the Cre- 
ator the rein s o tha t they may s urround the Circle already described. Without these 
Circles shalt thou circumscribe a Square, and beyond that another Square, so that the 
An gles of t he for mer may touch the centres of the sides of the latt er, an d that the 
Angles of the latter may stretch towards the four quarters of the Universe, East, West, 
North, an d South; an d at the four Angles of each square, and touching them, thou 
shalt describe lesser Circles whe rein let there be placed standing censers with lighted 
charcoal and sweet odours. 
 These things being done, let the Magus of Art assemble his Disciples, exhort, con- 
fir m, and ch eer them ; l ead t hem into t he Ci rcle of Art a nd st ation them therein 
towards the Four Quarters of the Universe, ex hort them to fear nothing, and to abide 
in thei r ass ign ed p la ces . Furthermore l et each o f the Comp anions h ave a Sword

Magus quit the Circle, and Kindle the Censers, and place thereon exorcised Incense, as 
is said in the Chapter of Fumig ations; and let h im have the Censers in h is ha nd a nd 
kindle it, and then place it in the part prepared. Let him now enter within the Circle 
and carefully close the openings left in the same and let him again warn his Disciples, 
and take the Trumpet of Art prepared as is said by the Chapter concerning the sam e, 
and let him incense the Circle towards the Four Quarters of the Universe. 
 After this l et the Magus c om mence his Incantations, having placed the S ickle, 
Sword, or other Implement of Art upright in the ground at his fee t. Having sounded 
the trumpet as before taught let him invoke the Spirits, and if need be conjure them,

 Chapter X. 
Concerning Incense, Suffumigations, Perfumes, Odours, and Similar Things 
 Which Are Used In Magical Arts. 
There are many kinds of Incense, Suffumigations, and Perfumes, which are made for 
and o ffered unto the S pirits; those which are of sweet od our are for the good, t hose 
which are of evil savour are for the evil. 
 For perfum es of good odour, take thou aloes, nutmeg, gum benjamin, musk, and 
make a mixture which will give off a good perfume. 
 For a suitable Suffum igation, thou may burn Incense, as it gives forth a most fra- 
grant odour which seems to possess the power to attract the Good Spirits, and force 
the Evil Ones to go away from thee; over which thou shalt say: 
 THE EXORCISM OF INCENSE. 
 O God of Abraham, G od of Isaac, G od of Jacob, deign to bless this odoriferous 
Incense so that it may receive strength, v irtue, and power to attract the Good Spirits, 
and to banish and cause to retire all hostile Phantoms. Through Thee, O Most Holy 
Adonai, Who livest and reignest unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen. 
 I exorcise thee, O Spirit impure and unclean, thou who art a hostile Phantom, in 
the Name of God, that thou quit this Incens e, thou and all th y deceits, that it may be 
consecra ted and sanctified in the name of God Almighty. May the Holy Spirit of God 
grant protection and virtue unto those who use Incense and may the hostile an d Evil 
Spirit and Phantom never be able to enter therein, through the Ineffable Name of God 
Almighty. Amen. 
 O Lord, deign to bless and to sanctify this Sacred Incense so that it may be a rem- 
edy unto mankind for the health of body and of so ul, through the Invocation of Thy 
Holy Name. M ay al l Creatures wh o r eceive t he odour of t his In cense and of t hese 
spices receive health of body an d of soul, t hrough Him who ha th formed the Ages. 
Amen. 
 After t his th ou sha lt s prink le the va rious Spices with the Wa ter of the Art, and 
thou shalt place them aside in a piece of silk as in other cases, or in a box destined for 
the purpose, so that thou mayest have them ready prepared for use when necessary. 
 When thou wishest to use the Incense, thou shalt kindle a fire of fresh Incense, in 
an I ncens e Bu rn er, a nd the Incens e being lighte d thou shalt say over it as follows, 
before putting the Spices beside the Incense Burner: 
 THE EXORCISM OF THE FIRE. 
 I exorcise thee, O Creature of Fire, by Him through Whom all things have been 
made, so that every kind of Phantasm may retire from thee, and be unable to harm or 
deceive in any way, through the Invocation of the Most Hig h Creator of all. Amen.

 This being d one, t hou sh alt put the Spic es upon the Fi re, an d make wh at per-

serve us for aid in all that we wish to perform therewith, that all deceit may quit them,

 If it be necessary to sprinkle with water anything required in the Art it should be

 Prepare a Censer in the d ay and hour of Mercur y, wi th t he odoriferous Spices of 
the Art. After this thou shalt take a vessel of brass, of lead varnished within and with- 
out, or of earth, which thou shalt fill with most clear spring water, and thou shalt have 
salt, and say these words over the salt: 
 TZABAOTH, MESSIACH, EMANUEL, ELOHIM GIBOR, YOD H E VAU HE: O 
God who art the Truth and the Life, deign to bless and sanctify this Creature of Salt, to 
serve unto us for help, protection, and assistance in this Art, experiment, and opera- 
tion, and may it be a succor unto us. 
 After this cast the salt int o the vessel w herein is the Water, and say the following 
Psalms: cii.; liv.; vi.; lxvii. 
 Thou shalt then make unto thyself a Sprinkl er of vervain, fennel, lavender, sage, 
valeria in mint, garden-basil, rosemary, a nd hyssop, gathered in the day a nd hour of 
Merc ur y, the moon being in h er inc rease. Bind together these h erbs with a thread 
spun by a young maiden, and engrave upon the handle on the one side the characters 
shown in Figure 82, and on the other side those given in Figure 83. 
 After this thou mayest use the water, using the Sprinkler whenever it is necessary; 
and know that wheresoever thou shalt sprinkle this Water, it will chase away all Phan- 
toms, and the y shall be u nable to hinde r or annoy any. Wit h thi s same Wate r tho u

 Of the Light, and of th e Fire.
It hath been ever the custom among all nations to use fire and light in sacred things.
For this reason the Master of t he Art sh ould al so employ them i n sac red rites, an d
besides th ose for reading th e Conjurations by, and for the incense, in a ll o perations
Lights are necessary in the Circle. 
 For this reason he should make candles of virgin wax in the day and hour of Mer-
cury; the w icks should h ave been mad e by a young girl; and the Candles should be
made when the moon is in her increase, of the weig ht of half a pound each, and on
them thou shalt engrave these characters with the Dagger, or the Burin of Art. 
 Figure 84.
 After this thou shalt repeat over the Candles, Psalms cli.; ciii.; cvii., and shalt say:
 O Lord G od, Who governest all things by Thine Almight y Power, give unto me, a
poor sinner, u nde rsta nding and kno wledge to do o nly that which is agreeable unto
Thee ; grant unto me to fear, ad ore, love, praise and give thank s unto Thee with true
and sincere faith a nd pe rfect c harity. Grant, O Lo rd, b efore I die, and descend into
the realms beneath, and before the fiery flame shall d evour me, that Thy Grace may
not leave me, O Lord of my Soul. Amen. 
 After this thou sha lt add: 
 I exorcise thee. O Creature of wax, by Him Who alone hath created all things by
His Word, and by the virtue of Him Who is pure truth, that thou cast out from thee
every Phantasm, Perversion, and Deceit of the Enemy, and may the Virtue and Power
of God enter into thee, so that thou mayest give us l ight, and chase far from us all fear
or terror. 
 After this tho u shalt s prinkle the m w ith the Wa ter of the Art, and incense them
with the usual perfumes. 
 And when thou sha lt wish to kindle them thou shalt say:
 I exorcise thee, O Creature of Fire, in the Name of the Sovereign and Eternal Lord,
by His Ineffable Name, which is YOD, HE, VAU, HE; by the Name IAH; and by the
Name of Power E L; that t hou mayest en lighten the h eart of all the Spirits which we
shall call unto this Circle, so that they may appear before us without fraud and deceit
through Him Who hath created all things. 
 Then thou shalt take a square Lanter n, with panes of Cr ystal glass, and thou shalt

which thou shalt require it.

 Fear ye not, my beloved Companions, seeing that we draw near unto the desired 
end; therefore, all things being rightly done and the Conjurations and Exorcisms dili- 
gently p erformed, ye shall behold King s of Kings, and Emperors of Emperors, and 
other King s, P r inc es, an d M a jest ies w ith t hem, an d a gr eat cr owd o f fol lowers,
together with all sorts of musical instruments, yet nothing should either the Magus or 
his Disciples fear. 
 And then let the Magus say: 
 I exhort you by these Holy Names of God, ELOHIM, ADONAI, AGLA, that none 
of you now presume to move or cross over from your appointed stations. 
 This b eing said, l et the Magus and his Disciples uncover the Holy Pentacles and 
show them towards each quarter, and the y being shown in each place, there shall be 
noises and rushings. 
 Then shall the Emperor of (the Spirits) say unto you: From the time of the Great 
Addus until now, there hath not been an Exorciser who could behold my person, and 
unless those things which ye have showed unto us hath been made, ye would not now 
have se en me. But seeing that ye have p owerf ully called us, as I believe, by the rites 
derived from Solomon, and which but few of your comrades, or Exorcisers, possess, 
also they compel us against our will, and I therefore say unto thee that we wish to be 
obedient in all matters. 
 Then shall the Magus place th e pe titions of himself and his companio ns, w hich 
sh ould be written down clearly on v irgin card, or paper, beyond the Circle towa rds 
the Ki ng or Prince of the Sp ir its, an d he w ill r eceive i t and ta ke co unse l wit h his
Chiefs. After this he will return the Card, saying: That which thou desirest is accom- 
plished, be thy will performed, and all thy demands fulfilled.

 Chapter XIV.
 Of The Pen, Ink, And Col ours.
All things employed for writing, &c ., in this Art, should be prepared in the follow-
ing manner: 
 Thou s halt take a ma le gosling, from which thou s ha lt pluck the thir d feathe r of
the right wing, and in plucking it thou shalt say:
 ADRAI, HAHLII, TAMAII, TILONAS, ATHAMAS, ZIANOR, ADONAI, ba nish
from this pen all deceit an d error, so that it may be of virtue and efficacy to write all
that I desire. Amen. 
 Afte r this tho u shalt sharpen it with the penknife of the Ar t, perfume it, sprinkle
it, and place it aside in a silken cloth. 
 Thou shalt have an Inkstand made of earth or any convenient matter, and in the
day and ho ur o f Mercury tho u shalt e ngrave the reon w ith the Burin of Ar t the se
Names: YOD, HE, VAU, HE, Metatron, Iah Iah Iah, Qadosch, Elohim Tzabaoth (see
Figure 85); and in putting the ink therein thou shalt say:
 I exorcise thee, O Crea ture of Ink, by ANAIRETON, by SIMULATOR, and by the
Name ADONAI, and by the Name of Him through Whom all things were made, that
thou be unto me an aid and succor in all things which I wish to perform by thine aid.
 As it sometimes happeneth that it is necessary to write with some noble color, it is
well to have a new and clean box wherein to keep them. The principal colors w ill be
Yellow or Gold, Red, Celestial or Azure Blue, Green, and Brown; and any other colors
that may be requisite. Thou shalt exorcise, perfume, and sprinkle them in the usual
manner.

 After this t hou shalt point a nd complete t he pen with the Knife of the Ar t, and

 Chapter XVII. 
 Of Virgin Parchment, or Virgin Paper, And How It Should Be Prepared. 
Virgin Parchment Paper, ma de from th e s kin of de a d-born lambs, whic h is ne w, 
pure, clean, and exorcised, never having served for any other purpose. 
 Genuine Virgin Parchment is necessar y in many Magical Operations, and should 
be proper ly prep ared an d consec rated. T here ar e two kinds, o ne ca lled Virgin, the 
other Unborn. Virgin Parchment is that which is taken from an Animal which hath 
not attained the age of generation, whether it be ram, or kid, or other animal. 
 Unborn Parchment is taken from an animal which hath been taken before its time 
from the uterus of its mother. 
 Take whichsoever of these two classes of animals thou pleasest, provided only that 
it be male, and in the day and hour of Mercur y; and take it to a secret place where no 
man may see t hee at work . Thou shalt have a marsh-reed cut at a single stroke with a 
new knife, and thou sha lt strip from it the leaves, repeating this Conjuration: 
 THE CONJURATION OF THE REED. 
 I conjure thee by t he Cr eator of all things, an d by the Ki ng of An gels, Wh ose 
Name is EL S HADDAI, that thou receivest strength and virtue to flay this animal and 
to construct the parchment whereon I may write the Holy Names of God, and that it 
may acquire so great v ir tue t hat all wh ich I shall write or d o may obt a in it s effect ,
through Him who liveth unto the Eternal Ages. Amen. 
 Before cutting the Reed recite Psalm lxxii. 
 After this, with the Knife of the Art, thou shalt fashion the Reed into the shape of 
a Knife, and upon it thou shalt write these Names: AGLA, ADONAI, ELOHI (see Fig- 
ure 87), through Whom be the work of this Knife accomplished. Then thou shalt say: 
 O God, who drewest Moses, Thy well-beloved and Th ine elect, from among the 
Reed s on the marshy banks of the Nile, and from the Waters, he being yet but a child, 
grant unto me th rough Thy g reat mercy a nd compa ssion that this Reed may receive 
Power and Virtue to effect that which I desire through Thy Holy Name and the Names 
of Thy Holy Angels. Amen. 
 This b ein g do ne, th ou s ha lt comm enc e w ith th i s K nife to f la y t he Ani ma l,
whether it be Virgin or Unborn, saying:

 ZOHAR, ZIO, TAL MAÏ , ADONAI , SHADDA I, TETRAGRAMMATON, a nd Ye
Holy Angels of God; be present, and grant power and virtue unto this parchment, and
may it be consecrated by you, so that all things which I shall write thereon shall obtain
their effect. Amen. 
 The Animal being flayed, take Salt, and say thus over it:
 God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, Who hast created all things from Negative Exist-
ence, deign to bless and sanct ify this S alt, s o that in plac ing it u pon this parchment
which I wish to make, it may have such v irtue that whatsoever I may write on it here-
after may attain its desired end. Amen. 
 Afterwards rub the said parchment with the exorcised salt, and leave it in the Sun,
to im bibe this s alt for the sp ace of an en tire da y. Then take a la rge ear t hen vessel
glazed within and without, round the outside of which thou s halt w rite the c haracters
in Figure 88. 
 Figure 88.
 After this thou shalt put powdered lime into the vessel, saying:
 OROH, ZARON, ZAINON, ZE VARO N, ZA PHIEL, ELIO N, be y e presen t an d
bless this work so that it may attain the desired e ffect, through the King of the Heav-
ens, and the God of the Angels. Amen. 
 Ta ke then exorcise d Wa ter an d pour i t upon t he sai d l ime, an d place the skin
therein for three days, after which thou shalt take it thence, and scrape therefrom the
lime and flesh adhering, with the Knife of Reed.
 After this thou shalt cut, with a single stroke, a wand of H azel, long e nough for
thee to form a Circle therewith; take also a cord spun by a young maiden, and small
stones or pebbles from a brook, pronouncing these words:
 O God Adonai, Holy and Power ful Father, put virtue into these stones, that they
may ser ve to st retc h this parchment, an d to ch ase t herefrom al l fraud , an d may it
obtain virtue by Thine Almighty Power. 
 After this, having stretched the said parchment upon the Circle and bound it with
the cord and stones, thou shalt say: 
 AGLA, YOD, HE, VAU, HE, IAH, EMANUEL, bless and preserve this parchment,
so that no Phantasm may enter therein. 
 Let it dry thus for three days in a dark and shady place, then cut the cord with the
Knife of Art, and detach the Parchment from the Circle, saying:
 ANTO R, ANCO R, TU RLOS , BE ODONOS , PHAI AR, AP HARCAR, b e pres ent
for a guard un to this Parchment. 
 Then perfume it, and keep it in silk ready for use.

 No woman, if her flowers be upon her, should be permitted to see this Parchment; 
ot he rw is e it w ill l ose its v ir tue. He w ho m aketh it s hould b e p ure, clean, a nd
prepared. 
 But if the preparation of the aforesaid parchment seemeth too tedious, thou may- 
est make it in the following manner, but it is not so good. 
 Take any Pa rchment, and exorcise it; prepare a censer with perfumes; write upon 
the pa rchment the characters in Figure 89, hold it over the Incense, and say: 
 Be y e presen t to ai d me, an d may my op er ation be accomplish ed through you: 
ZAZAH, ZALMAI I, DALMAII, ADONAI, ANAPHAXE TON, CEDRION, CRIPON, 
PRION, ANAIRETON, ELION, OCTINOMON, ZEVANON, ALAZAION, ZIDEON, 
AGLA, ON, YOD HE VAU HE, ARTOR, DINOTOR, Holy Angels of God; he present 
and infuse virtue into this Parchment, so that it may obtain such power through you 
that all N ames or Char acters thereron written may receive due p ower, an d that all 
deceit and hindrance may depart therefrom, through God the Lord merciful and gra- 
cious, Who liveth and reigneth through all the Ages. Amen. 
 Then shalt thou recite over the parchment Psalms lxxii.; cxvii.; and cxxiv.; and the 
"Benedicite Omnia Opera." Then say: 
 I conjure the e, O Virgin Pa rchment, by all the Holy Names, that tho u o bta inest 
efficacy and strength, and becomest exorci sed and consecrated, so that none of the 
things w hich may be w rit ten u pon thee sh all be effa ced from the B ook o f Truth. 
Amen. 
 Then sprinkle it, and keep it as before said. 
 The Cauls of newly-born children, duly consecrated, may also be used instead of 
Virgin Parchment. Also paper, satin, silk, and the like substances, may be employed in 
operations of less importance if duly exorcised and consecrated.

 Of Wax And Virgin Earth.
Wax and Virgin E arth are also e mployed i n many Mag ical Oper ations, wh et her to

 The wa x should be t a ken from bees whi ch ha ve only made it for the first time,

 Concerning Characters, And The Consecration Of The Magical Book. 
Whensoever in any Operation it is necessar y to wr ite C haracters, and thou fearest 
that thou w ilt fail, do this: Write at the beginning the Name EHIEH ASHER EHIEH 
(Figure 91) , and at the end the name AIN S OPH (Figure 92); between thes e Name s 
write what thou wishest, and if thou hast anything especial to do bear the said written 
Names upon the wrapper in silk, and thou shalt say over them: 
 Most Wise and Most High C reator of all things, I p ray Thee fo r Thy gr ace a nd 
mercy that Thou mayest gr ant such v irtue an d power unto t hese Holy Names, that 
Thou mayest keep thes e characters from all deceit and er ror, through Thee, O Most

 After hav ing rep eat ed this thou shalt write the requisite Char act ers, an d thou

 Mak e a B ook , co n tai ning si xteen p ages, fr om Vir gin P ar chment, and wr ite 
ther ein, with red ink, the Prayers for all the Operations, the Names of the Angels in 
the form of Litanies, their Seals and Characters; the w hich being done thou shalt con- 
secrate the same unto God and unto the pure Spirits in the manner following: 
 Thou sh alt se t in the destined place a small ta ble cov er ed with a whi te cloth, 
whereon thou shalt lay the Book opened at the Great Pentacle which should be drawn 
on the first leaf o f the sai d Book; a nd havi ng kindled a l amp wh ich sh ould be sus- 
pended above the center o f the table, tho u shalt surround the said table with a white 
curtain; clothe thyself i n the proper vestments, and h olding the Book open , repeat 
upon thy knees the following prayer w ith great humility: 
 (For the Prayer beginning "Adonai Elohim," &c., see Book I., Chapter XIV., where 
it is given in full.) 
 After wh ich thou sh alt incense i t wi th the incense proper to the Planet and the

of the la mp be kept u p continually during the op era tio n, and keeping the cur ta ins
closed. Repeat the same ceremony for seven days, beginning with Saturday, and per-
fuming the Bo ok e ach da y w ith the I ncense pr oper to th e P lanet ru ling the day a nd
hour, and taking heed that th e l amp shall burn both da y and night; afte r the whic h
thou shalt shut up the Book in a small drawer under the table, made expressly for it,
unt il thou sh alt have occasion to use i t; and ever y time that thou wi sh es t to use it ,
clot he thyse lf with thy vestments, kin dle the la mp, and repea t upon thy k nees the
aforesaid prayer, "Adonai Elohim." &c.
 It is necessa ry a lso, in th e Consecration of th e Bo ok, to summon a ll t he Angels
whose Names are w ritten therein in the form of Litanies, the which thou shalt do with
devot ion; and even if the Angels and Spirits appear not in the C onsecration of the
Book, be not thou astonished thereat, seeing that they are of a pure nature, and conse-
quently have much difficulty in familiarizing themselves with men who are inconstant
and impure, but the Ceremonies and Characters being correctly carried out devout-
edly and w ith per severance, t hey wi ll be c onstrained to come, an d it will at l ength
happen tha t a t th y first in vocation tho u w ilt be able to s ee and c ommuni cate with
them. But I advise thee to undertake nothing unclean or impure, for then thy impor-
tunity, far from attracting them, will only serve to chase them from thee; and it will be
thereafter exceedingly difficult for thee to attract them for use for pure ends.

 Book Two 
 Chapter XXII. 
 Concerning Sacrifices To The Spirits, And How They Should Be Made. 
In many operations it is necessary to make some sort of sacrifice unto the De mons, 
and in various ways. Sometimes white animals are sacrificed to the good Spirits and 
black to the evil. Such sacrifices consist of the blood and sometimes of the flesh. 
 They who sacrifice animals, of whatsoever kind they be, should select those which 
ar e v ir gin, as bei ng mor e ag reeabl e un to t he Sp irit s, an d render i ng t hem mor e
obedient. 
 When blood is to be sa crificed it should be drawn also from v irgin quadrupeds or 
birds, but before offering the oblation, say: 
 May this Sacrifice which we find it proper to offer unto ye, noble and lofty Beings, 
be agr eea ble a nd pleasing u nto your d esir es; b e y e read y to obey us, and y e shall 
receive greater ones. 
 Then perfume and sprinkle it according to the rules of Art. 
 When it is necessary, with all th e pr oper C eremo nies, to make Sacrifices of fire, 
they should be made of wood which hath some quality referring especially unto the 
Spirits invoked; as juniper or pine unto the Spirits of Saturn; box, or oak , unto those 
of Jupiter; cornel, or cedar, unto those of Mars; laurel unto thos e of the Sun; myrtle 
unto tho se of Venus; ha ze l unto tho se of Mercur y; and w illow unto tho se of the 
Moon. 
 But when we make s acrifices of food and drink, everything necessar y should be 
prepared without the Circle, a nd the mea ts should be covered wi th some f ine clean 
cloth, an d h ave also a c lean white cloth sp read ben eath them; w ith n ew bread an d 
good and sparkling wine , b ut in all thin gs tho s e w hich refer to th e natu re o f the 
Planet. A nimals, such as fo wls o r pigeon s, shoul d be r oasted. Esp eci ally shoul dst 
thou have a vessel of clear and pure fountain water, and before thou enterest into the 
Circle, thou sha lt s ummon the Spirits by the ir proper Names, or a t lea st those chief 
among them, saying: 
 In whatsoever place ye may be, ye Spirits, who are invited to this feast, come ye 
and be ready to receive our offerings, presents, and sacrifices, and ye shall have hereaf- 
ter yet more agreeable oblations. 
 First perfume the room by burning Incense therein, and sprinkle the viands with 
exorcised Water; then commence to conjure the Spirits until they shall come. 
 This is the manner of ma king sacr ifices in all a rts and oper ations wherein it is 
necessar y, and acting thus, the Spirits will be prompt to serve thee.

 Book Two 
 ANCIENT FRAGMENT OF THE KEY OF SOLOMON. 
Translated From The Hebrew By Eliphaz Levi; And Given In His "Philosophie Occulte." 
– Serie II, Page 136. 
 I will now give unto thee the Key of the Kingdom of the Spirits. 
 This Key is the same as that of the Mysterious Numbers of Yetzirah. 84 
 The Spirits are governed by the natural and universal Hierarchy of things. 
 Thrice command Three through the medium of Three. 
 Ther e are t he S pirits of A bove, t hos e of Below, and thos e of the Center ; then if
thou investest the Sacred Ladder, if th ou descendest ins tead of ascending , thou w ilt 
discover the Counter-Hierarchy of the Shells, or of the Dead Spirits. 
 Know thou only that the Principalities of Heaven, the Virtues, and the Powers, are 
not Persons, but dignities. 
 They are t he Degrees of the Sacr ed Ladder up on wh ich the Sp irits asc end an d 
descend. 
 Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and the others, are n ot Names but Titles. 
 The First of the Numbers is the Unity. 
 The First of the Divine Conceptions called the Sephiroth is Kether or the Crown. 
 The First Category of the Spirits is that of Chaioth Ha-Qadesh or the Intelligences 
of the Divine Tetragram, whose Letters are sy mbolized by the Mysterious Animals in 
the Prophecy of Ezekiel. 
 Their empire is that of unity and synthesis. They correspond to the Intelligence. 
 They h ave for adversaries the Thamiel o r Double-Headed Ones, the Demons of 
revolt and of anarchy, whos e two Chiefs, ever at war with ea ch other, are Satan and 
Moloch. 
 The Second Number is two; the Second Sephira is Chokmah or Wisdom. 
 The Spirits of Wisdom are the Auphanim, a Na me whic h signif ieth the Wheels, 
because all acts in Heaven like i mmense Wheels spangled with Stars. Their Empire is 
that of Harmony. They correspond to the Reason. 
 They have for Adversaries the Chaigidel, or the Shells which attach them selves to 
Mate rial and Lying Appearances. Their Chief, or rath er their Guide , for Evil Spirits 
obe y no one, is B eelzebub, w hose Name signifieth the God of Flies, b ecau se Fli es 
haunt putrefying corpses. 
 The third Number is three. The third Sephira is Binah or Understanding. 
 The Spiri ts o f Binah are Ara lim, or th e St rong. Their empire is th e creation of 
ideas; they correspond to activity and energy of thought. 
 They have for adversaries the Satariel, or concealers, the Demons of absurdity, of 
intellectual inertia, and of Mystery. The Chief of the Satariel is Lucifuge, called falsely 
and by anti-phrase Lucifer (as the Eumenides, who are the Furies, are called in Greek 
the Gracious Ones.). 
 The fourth Number is four. The fourth S ephira is Gedulah or Chesed, Magnifi- 
cence or Mercy. 
 Page 123



--------------------------------------- 44

 The Key of Solomon
 The Spirits of Gedulah are the Chaschmalim, or the Lucid On es. Their empire is
that of beneficence; they correspond to the imagination.
 They have for adversaries the Gamchicoth or the Distur bers of Souls. The Chief
or Guide of these De mons is Ashta roth or Astarte, the impu re Venus of the Syria ns,
whom they represent with the head of an ass or of a bull, and the breasts of a woman.
 The fifth Number is five. The fifth Sephira is Geburah or Justice.
 The Spirits of Geburah are the Seraphim, or the Spirits burning with zeal. Their
empire is that of the chastisement of crimes. They correspond to the faculty of com-
paring and of choosing. 
 They have for a dversaries the Golab or in cindiaries, Genii o f wrath and sedition,
whose Chief is Asmodeus, whom they also call Samael the Black.
 The sixth Number is six. The sixth Sephira is Tiphereth the Supreme Beaut y.
 The Spir its of Tiphereth are the Ma lachim, or the Kings. Their empire is that of
the Universal Ha rmony. They correspond to the judgment.
 They have for adversaries the Tagaririm, or Disputers, whose Chief is Belphegor.
 The seventh Number is seven. The seventh Sephira is Netzach, or Victory.

 Book Two 
 His Name is compo sed of the letters of the D ivine Tetra gram c hanged in to the 
Pentagram by the addition of the Letter Schin (see Figure 94). 
 Each let ter of t his Pentag ram represen ts a power of goo d attacked by the five 
accursed nations. 
 For the real history of the people of God is the allegorical legend of Humanity. 
 The five accursed nations are: 
 1. The Amalekites or Aggressors; 
 2. The Geburim or Violent Ones; 
 3. The Raphaim or Cowards; 
 4. The Nephilim or Voluptuous Ones; 
 5. The Anakim or Anarchists. 
 The Anarchists are vanquished by the Yod, which is the Sceptre of the Father. 
 The Violent are vanquished by the HE, which is the Gentleness of t he Mother. 
 The Cowards are vanquished by the Vau, which is the Sword of Michael, and Gen- 
eration by travail and pain. 
 The Voluptuous are vanquished by the second HE, which is the painful bringing 
forth of the Mother. 
 Lastly, the Aggressors a re vanquished by the Schin, which is the Fire of the Lord 
and the equilibrating Law of Justice. 
 The Princes of the Perverse Spirits are the False Gods whorm they adore. 
 Hell has then no other government than that fatal law which punishes per versity 
and corrects error, for the false Gods only exist in the false opinion of their adorers. 
 Baal, Belphegor, Molo ch, Adr amelech, have been the idols o f the Syr ia ns; idols 
without soul, idols now destroyed, and of whom the Na me alone remaineth. 
 The True G od h ath van qui shed al l the D emon s as Trut h triumphs over Error. 
That is past in th e opinions of men, a nd t he Wars o f Micha el against Satan are the 
symbols of movement, and of the progress of Spirits. 
 The Devil is ever a God of refusal. 
 Accredited idolatries are religions in their time. 
 Superannuated idolatries are Superstitions and Sacrileges. 
 The P ant he on of P han toms, wh ich ar e then i n vogue, is t he H eaven of t he 
Ignorant. 
 The Receptacle of Phantoms, whom Folly even wisheth for no longer, is the Hell. 
 But all this existeth only in the Imagination of the Vulgar. 
 For the wise, Heaven is the Supreme Reason, and Hell is Folly. 
 But it must be understood that we here employ the word Heaven in the Mystical 
sense which we give it in opposing to it the word Hell. 
 In order to evoke Phantoms it is sufficient to intoxicate oneself or to render one- 
self m ad; for Phantoms are ever the companions of drunkenness and of vertigo. 
 The Phosphorus of the imagination, abandoned to all the caprices of over-excited 
and diseased nerves, fills itself with Monsters and absurd visions. 
 We can also arrive at hallucination by mingling together wakefulness and sleep by 
the graduated use of narcotics; but such actions are crimes against nature.

 The Key of Solomon
 Wisdom chaseth away Phantoms, and enables us to communicate with the Supe-
rior Spirits by the con templation of t he L aws of N ature and the st udy of t he Holy
Numbers. 
 (Here King Solomon addresseth himsel f to his son, Roboam):
 Do thou, O my son Roboam, remember, that the fear of Adonai is only the begin-
ning of Wisdom. 
 Keep and preserve tho se who have no t unde rsta nding in th e Fear o f A donai,
which will give and will preserve unto thee my crown.
 But learn to triumph thys elf over Fear by Wisdom, and th e Spirits w ill descend
from Heaven to serve thee. 
 I, So lomon , thy fa t her, King of Isr ael and of Palmyra, I have so ught o ut and
obtained in my lot the Holy Chokmah, which is the wisdom of Adonai.
 And I have become King of the Spirits as well of Heaven as of Earth, Master of the
Dwellers of the Air, and of t he Living Souls of the Sea, because I was in posse ssion of
the Key of t he Hidden Gates of Light.
 I have done great thing s b y the v irtue of the Schema Hamph orasch, and by th e
Thirty-two Paths of Yetzirah. 
 Number, weight, and measure determine the form of things; the substance is one,
and God createth it eternally. 
 Happy is he who comprehendeth the Letters and the Numbers.
 The Let ters ar e fr om t he Number s, and the N umber s from t he Ideas , and the
Ideas from the Forces, and the Forces from the Elohim. The Synthesis of the Elohim
is the Schema. 
 The Sch ema i s one, i ts columns ar e t wo, it s power is three, i t s form i s fo ur, its
reflect ion giveth eigh t, wh ich mul tiplied by three giveth unto thee t he twen ty-fou r
Thrones of Wisdom. 
 Upon each Throne reposeth a Crow n with three Rays, each Ray beareth a Name,
each Name is an Absolute Idea. There are Seventy-two Names upon the Twent y-four
Crowns of the Schema. 
 Thou shalt wr ite these Names up on Thirt y-six Ta lismans, two upon ea ch Talis-
man, one on each side. 
 Thou shalt divide these Talismans into four series of nine e ach, according to the
number of the Letters of the Schema. 
 Upon the first Series thou shalt engrave the Letter Yod, symbolized by the Flower-
ing Rod of Aaron. 
 Upon the second the Letter HE, symbolized by the Cup of Joseph.
 Upon the third the Letter Vau, symbolized by the Sword of David my father.
 And upon the four th the HE final, symbolized by the Shekel of Gold.
 These thir ty-six Ta lismans w ill be a B ook which w ill c ontai n all t he Se crets of
Na tu re. A nd b y the ir diverse c omb inatio ns t hou s halt m ake t he G eni i a nd A ngels
speak. 
 HERE ENDETH THE FRAGMENT OF THE KEY OF SOLOMON.
