 GERARD CREMONENSIS ON ASTRONOMICAL GEOMANCY . 
Because Astronomy is so transcendent and subtil an Art in itself, that 
therein a man ought to have respect unto so many things before he can 
attain e to true judgment thereby, because the eye of the understanding will 
not pierce unto the half thereof, and few Doctors of our later time have 
been found so experienced therein that they know? suciently how to 
judge thereby; Therefore I have composed this work, which I wilt have to be named, 
Astronomical Geomancy; wherein, I will su? ciently teach how to judge with less labour and 
study. For in this present science it is not requisite to behold neither the Ascendant, nor 
the hour in a Table, as it is in Astrology. 
 It is expedient therefore, to make four unequal lines, by the points ca sua lly set down; 
and to joyne together those points; and out of the points which are not joyned together, 
which do remain in the heads of the lines, (as it is done in Geomancie) extract o? gurnee ; 
and the signe of the Zodiack that answereth to tha?t gure, put for the Ascendent, for the 
words sake. If Acquisitio arise from the heads of those four Lines, lAreti es be placed in the 
Ascendent; if Laetitia , or the lesser Fortune put Taurus in the Ascendent; ifPue r or Rubeu,s 
place Gemin; If i Albus, Cancer; if Via, Leo; if Conjunctio or the Dragons Head, Virgo; if 
Puella, Libra; if Amissio or Tristitia , Scorpi; ifo the Dragons Tail, Sagittary; if Populus, Cap- 
ricorn; if Fortuna majo, rAquary; if Carcer, then put Pisce for s the Ascendent. Afterwards in 
the second House, let that signe be placed which immediately succeeds the other. In the 
third House the third Signe, and so place the rest in order until you come unto the end of 
the Signes; and make one squa?re gure divided into twelve equal parts, and therein place 
the Signes in order, as it is in Astrology, and as you m? nde themay in this ? gure: neither 
are we here to regard the * witnesses, or * Judge, or any other thing, which belongs to Geo- 
mancie; but onely the sixteen F igures, that by them we may have the t welve Signes, to 
which they agree; and obser ve the maner of the Figure as it is here placed. 
 Afterwards it is requisite to make four Lines by course for every Planet, by points casu- 
ally pricked down; and likewise for tDhre agons Head, as you have done for the Ascendent, 
and divide those points by twelve; and that which remaineth above twelve, or the twelfth 
itself, if a greater number doth not remain, retaine, and the Planet for which the projection 
was made, place in that House of which the superabounding number shall be; that is, if 
there remain twelve, let the Planet be placed in the twelfth House; if ten, in the tenth 
House; if one, in the ? rst House; if two, in the second House; and so of the rest. And you 
ought alwayes to begin from theSun , and afterw ards from theM oon, then fromV enus and 
Mercur y, and fromSa turn, Jupiter and Mars, and theD ragons Head and Dragons Tail; but

you must alwayes take heed that you do not make a question in a rainy, cloudy, or a very
windy season, or when thou art angry, or thy minde busied with ma? airsny a; nor for
tempters or deriders, neither that you may renew and reiterate the same Question again
under the same ? gure or forme; for that is error.
 Questions of th? e rst House.
If you are desirous to know concer ning the life of any man whether it shall be long or
short, behold the Lord of the Ascendent, who if he be in strong Angles, it s? es loigni ng
life; in succedents, a middle age; and in c adent Houses, a short life; and if he be in strong
Angles, he sign?i es greater years; if in Succedents, meaner years; if in Ca dents, lesser
years. The lesser years of Saturn are thirty, the meaner are forty four years, and the greater
? f ty eight. The lesser years of Jupiter are twelve, the meaner years forty, and the greater
accordingly are forty seven. The lesser yearsMa orsf are ? fteen, his meane years forty, and
the greater years forty seven. The lesser years of the Sun are nineteen, his mean years forty
? ve, and his greater years eighty two. The lesser years of Venus are eight, her mean years
2 



--------------------------------------- 3

forty ? ve, and her greater years eighty twMeo. rcury' les sser years are twenty, his mean 
years forty nine, and his greater years eighty. The lesser years of Moothe n are ? fteen, her 
mean years thirty nine, and her greater years a hundred and seven. And also lMaoorks if 
or Saturn shall be in the ? rst House, and the Lord of the eighth with them; and if theSun 
shall be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live: likewise if the Lord of the Ascendent 
shall happen to be void of course, anMad rs be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live; 
but if the Sun and the Moon shall be in conjunction in the seventh House, anVenusd in the 
second, he shall live well. 
 The accidents of the nativity are likewise to be considered. If y? ndeou Satu rn or Mer- 
cury in the ? rst, * he is foolish and talkative; if it be Mars and Mercur y, he will not be ser- 
vile, but a wrangler and sco? er; if the Sun and Mercury, he will be a speaker of truth; and if 
the Sun be inAr ies, he will apply himself to learn whatsoever he shall heVear; inuf bes in
the seventh, he will be luxurious; and Satuif rn, Mercury and Venus be in their fall, he will 
be a Sodomite; if theSun and Venus be in the tenth, and thMoe on in the ? rst, he will be 
very liberal; ifVe nu, s Mercur y and the Dragons Hea be d in the? rst, he wilt be covetous; if 
the Moon and Mars be in the ? rst, he will be subject to great bondage; anMad if rs be L ord 
of the nativity, he will he rich, and an evil speaker, and litigious; and Suif then be in t he 
? rst, he will be envious, having a fair body, not very lean, nor very fat; and Venus beif in 
the ? rst, he will be white and fair; iMercf ury b e i n t he? rst, he will not be stable, but 
alwayes in motion; but if the Moon be found there, it denotes him to have a graceful face, 
brest and arms; iSaf turn be there, the man will be black an? lthd y; if Jupiter, he will have a 
round face, a fair forehead, a ruddy complexion mixt with a little white. 
 If you would know his? oce or art: if theMo on be in the seventh with Satu rn, or in the 
fourth, or in the tenth, or in the ? rst, It is not good for him to build any house in a City, 
nor to build a ship, neither is it good for him to be a tiller of land, or to dress vines, or 
plant trees; but to be imployed about som?ece o belonging to the water, or concerning 
marriages, or to be a Post or a Messenger; neither let him apply himself much to his mas- 
ter, because he shall gain no repute from him: ifMoo the n be in the? fth or third, it will be 
good to him; in the second, eighth, sixth and twelfth, neither good nor evil. 
 Jupiter signi? es Bishops, Prelates, Nobles, Potentates, Judges, W ise men, Merchants 
and Usurers. 
 Mars signi? es Warriors, Incendiaries, Homicides, Physitians, Barbers, Hangmen, 
Gold-smiths, Cooks, furnaces, and all ? reworks. And ifMa rs be in strong Signes, he will 
be poor and die in captivit y, unless he put himself in arms w ith some souldier or vassal. 
 The Sun signi? eth Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Lords and Judges. 
 Venu sis gni? es Queens and Ladies, Marriages, Communications, Friendship, Apothe- 
caries, Taylors, and such as make Ornaments for playes, sellers of Cloth, Jesters, Vintners, 
Players at dice, Whores and Robbers. 
 Mercury signi? es Clerks, Philosophers, Astrologers, Geometrici ans Arithm eticians, 
Latine writers, and Painters, and all subtil Artists, as well men as women, and their Arts.

--------------------------------------- 4

 Concerning the intention of the Querent, look unto the Signe ascending, and his Lord; 
and where you? nde the Lord of the Ascendent, he comes to inquire about something per- 
taining to that House; and if theSun be Lord of the Ascendent, his Question is concern- 
ing fear w hich he is in of some man; iVenusf , he enquireth of Arts, that he may know 
some proper Arts, or he enquireth concerning things belonging to womeMern. If cury be 
Lord of the Ascendent, he seek after something that is lost, or enquireth concerning some 
in? rmity. If the Moon he seeketh also for something lost, or inquireth about sickness, or 
some disease in his eyes. If Saturn be Lord of the Ascendent, he enquireth about some 
sickness, or concerning a Prince; and keepeth silence, but hast some great grief or anguish 
in his heart. If Jupiter be L ord of the Ascendent, his Question is concerning some? r- in 
mity, or restitution, or for some? oce which he desireth to have. If Mars, he enquireth for 
some fear, or of an enemy, death, sickness, riches, or substance. 
 Questions of the second House. 
If you would he informed concerning the substance of any man whether he shall be rich or 
not, behold the Lord of the second, which if he shall be with a good Planet, & a good 
Planet likewise in the second, he shall be rich; but if the Lord of the second be joined with 
evil Planets, and an evil Planet shall be in the second, he shall be poor. 
 If you would know whether you shall have again a thing lent, or not, look if there be an 
evil P lanet in the second, and disagreeing with his Lord; then he that detaineth the thing 
lent, will not willingly render ba ck the same: But if there be a good Planet in the second, 
and agreeing with his Lord, it shall easily be recovered; and if the Lord of the second, be 
exalted and be evil, or if an evil Planet be with him in the second, or if the Lord of the sec- 
ond, be exalted, he which keepeth the thing deposited, will not willingly restore the same, 
but he shall do it whether he will or not. And if an evil Planet be in the second, it's to be 
recovered: But ifMer cury be in the second, so that he be his Lord, and bringeth contrari- 
ety, then it shall be recovered; and if a good P lanet be in the second House, h?ees signi 
recover y, although he be the Lord thereof. 
 Mark therefore the concord and discord of the Planets: thMoone and Jupiter are 
friends, theMo on and Mars enemies;Mercur y and the Sun are friends,Mercur y and Venus 
enemies;V enus and Jupiter are friends,Ju piter and the Moon are enemies. 
 The Planets are said to be friends, when they agree in one nature and quaMality,r ass 
and the Sun, beca use both their natures is hot and dVryenus; and the Moon do agree in 
cold and moisture: or when Planets do agree in substance and natuJure, piaster and Venus 
are friends: or when the House of one is the exaltation of another, or on the contrary. 
 Questions of the third House. 
If that you desire to know, how many brethren a man hath, see the Lord of the third, and 
it is to be held, that to so many Planets as he is joyned, so many brethren the Querent 
4 



--------------------------------------- 5

hath; and the Masculine Planets sign? e bi rethren, and the female Planets sisters; and note, 
That Saturn and Mars, the Sun, Jupite, &r the Dragons Head, are masculine; but thMe oon, 
Venus and theD ragons Tail are foeminine: buMet rcury is promiscuous, sometimes Mascu- 
line and sometimes foeminine; he is Masculine when he is joyned to Masculine Planets, or 
when he is in a masculine quarter of the Zodiacke; and he is foeminine, when he is joyned 
to foeminine Planets, or when he is in a foeminine quarter of the Zodiacke. 
 Questions of the fourth House. 
If thou wouldst know whether it be good for thee to stay in any Land, City, Village, Terri- 
tory, or House, or not, behold the Lord of the Ascendent of the fourth, and of the sev- 
enth; and if the Lord of the fourth be in the seventh, and be good, and the Lords of the 
? rst and the te nth House be good, and with good Planets, then it is good for thee to con- 
tinue in that place wherein thou art. And if the Lord of the seventh be with a good Planet, 
and the Lord of the four th with an evil Planet, then it is not good for thee to abide there, 
because if thou dost continue there, thou shal?t esru many losses, & have evil reports 
raised on thee in that Country. 
 But if thou wouldst know when any one that is absent will return, behold the Lord of 
the Ascendent; and if you ? nde him in any one of the four Angles, he will return in that 
year; and if he be not in an Angle, then see how far he is distant from? rs tt Anglhe e; for 
so long he will stay, and so many years as there be Houses. 
 If you would be informed of the dearth or plenty of things, behold the strong Houses, 
the S uccedents and the Cadents; for the strong Houses si? gen deari th and scarcity, the 
Succedents a moderate season, neither too dear, nor too cheap, the Cadent?s signe pleni ty 
and pro? tableness of things. Consider also the Planets, and their places, which if they be 
in strong Houses, the things which are si?gned bi y those Planets will be rare: and note, 
That Saturn doth signi? e ? elds, vines, and instruments to work ?inel ds, and leather, and 
of fruits, corn, acorns, oak-apples, and pomegranateJupis. ter hath oil, honey, silk-wormes, 
cloth, wine, and grass, and things that are odoriferouMas.rs signi? es wine, and ? esh, and 
especially hogs, wars, and armour, and such things as belong thereunto, and red ga rments. 
The Sun bath signi? cation of wheat, and wine, purple colours, and cloth, and all things 
that are assimulated unto gold, horses and birds, such as hawks and falVcenusons doth. 
signi? e fatness and grapes?,gs and dates,? sh and pastimesMe. rcury hath barley, millet, 
grain, money, and quicksilver. The Moon signi? es oats, milk, cheese?, re and salt, cows, 
rams, hens, and silver, and accordingly plenty and scarcity of them. 
 Questions of th? e fth House. 
If you would know whether a woman be with Child, or whether she will have any chil- 
dren, or not, look if the Lord of the Ascendent be in the sev enth, or the Lord o?fft theh 
in the ? rst, or the Lord of the ? rst in the ? fth, or if the L ord of the? fth be in the seventh, 
 5



--------------------------------------- 6

or if the L ord of the se venth be in the ? f th, or the Moon with them; or if good Planets be 
in the ? rst, or the? fth, or with the Lord of the ? fth, or * R * in Angles, she is with child, 
or may have children; but if yo? un de none of them, but evil Planets in the same places, 
she neither is with childe, neither will she have any children: and if there be both good and 
evil Planets in the said places, then happily she may have children, but they will not live; 
but if Canc e, r Scorpi or o Pisces shall be in the ? rst or ? fth House, she may have children; 
but if Leo and Virgo be there, she is not with child, neither shall she ever have any children; 
or if the Lord of the ? f th shall be in them Houses. 
 And if you would know, within how many years she shall have children, look where you 
? nde the Lord of the ? fth; for in that year she shall have issue; if he be in? therst, in the
? rst year; if in the second, in the second year; and so you may number unto the twelf th 
House. And if mean Signes be in the Ascendent, she that is with child hath twins in her 
wombe, which will live, if a good Planet be in ?thrset; an d if an evil Planet, they will die; 
and if there be one good and another evil, one shall live, and another die; and if a mean 
Signe shall be ascending, anMard s in that Signe, the mother shall die, and not the childe; 
if Saturn, both the mother and child shall die; and if the Dragons Tail be there, its possible 
they will both die; but the infant shall not escape; and if theDrag ons Tail be so in the? rst, 
and the tenth House fallen: the mother shall die; likewiseMar if s and the Moon, or Mars 
and Saturn be in the? rst, seventh or tenth, the mother shall die. 
 Whether the party with child shall miscarry, or not. Consider if a moveable Signe be 
ascending, because if it be so she will miscarry. 
 If you would know whether a woman shall bring forth a man-child, or a woman-child; 
behold the Ascendent and his Lord, which if he be Masculine and in a Masculine Signe, 
or in a Masculine quarter of the Figure, it is a male-childe; but if the Lord of the Ascen- 
dent be feminine, and in a feminine S igne, or in a feminine quarter of the Circle, it will be 
a woman-child; and so you shall consider also of the Moon. Consider also if more of the 
Planets be in Masculine Signes, then it will be a male-childe; and if many P lanets be in 
feminine Signes, then it is a female childe. 
 And if you would know whether the child be legitimate or adulterate; seSatue irfn , 
Mars or the Dragons Tail be in the ? fth, or with the Lord of the? f th; because if it be so it 
is adulterate; bur if a good Planet shall be there, it is legitimate: and if the Lord of the? rst, 
be in the ? fth, or with his Lord, it is legitimate; and so likewise if the Lord of ?tfhth bee 
found in the? rst or with the Lord of the ? rst. 
 If you desire to know whether rumours be true or false, see if? nde you Sa turn, Mars or 
the Dragons Tail, in the Ascendent; because if they be so then the rumours are false; but if 
you ? nde the Sun, Jupiter or the Dragons Head there, then they are true; and if there be 
Masculine Planets in Masculine Signes, & feminine Planets in feminine Signes, then they 
are true; and if both good and evil Planets be there, then they are Partly true and Partly 
false; and if there be a good Signe with the Planet, is te? essti the truth; and if the Planet 
fall with an evil Signe, then it is false; likewiseMe if rcury be in the ? rst, the news is false: 
but if the Moon be in t he? rst in a feminine signe, or joyned with the Lord of the Ascen- 
6 



--------------------------------------- 7

dent in a feminine Signe, then the rumours are true; also if good P lanets be in? rst, the 
? f th or ninth, and feminine Signes, they are true; but if other wise, they are not. 
 If you would know whether any one that is absent will return, and when; see the Lord 
of the Ascendent; and th?e rst, which if you ? nde them together, for certain he will come, 
and is now beginning his journey. Likewise if the Lord of the? fth be in the ? rst, or with 
the Lord of the ? rst, and if he be in his fall, the messenger is sick in his way; but if the 
Lord of the ? fth be exalted, then he cometh joyfully. And if he be in a cadent Signe, he 
shall be grievously? aicted with sickness, or shall die. 
 If you would know if he bringeth that with him for which he went, or not, behold the 
Lord of the seventh; which if he be good, he bringeth that which he sought for; and if he 
be in his fall, or an evil Planet be there, be bringeth nothing with him. 
 Questions of the sixth House. 
Whether the sick shall recover his health, or die. If the Question be concerning his sick- 
ness, see ifSatu rn, or Mars, or the Dragons Tail be in the? rst, and whether his Lord be 
joyned with an evil Planet, then he shall die soon. And if the L ord o?f the rst be good, and 
evil Planets be in the? rst with his Lord, or likewise in the? rst o r the eighth, for certain he 
will die: But if the Lord of the ? rst be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth; or the 
Lord of the eighth in the ? rst, or with the Lord of the ? rst, there is doubt of his death. 
And if evil Planets do possess the Angles, evil and destruction is threatned to the sick. But 
if good Planets shall be in the? rs t, sixth and eighth, and likewise in the Angles, and the 
Lord of the ? rst be from the eighth & his Lord, then the sick person shall live and recover 
his health. 
 If you desire to know whether he will be cured by medicines, gi?ve therst Ho use to the 
Physitian, the tenth to the sick, the seventh to his diseases, and the fourth to the medi- 
cines. If evil Planets be in the ? rst, the Physitian shall pr?ot him nothing; but they tes?tie 
that this will be worse for the diseased: but the Fortunes do si? egn, that i he shall be prof- 
itable to him. And if evil Planets do occupy the tenth House, the sick person is the cause; 
for they testi? e, that he himself is the cause of his own disease: but the Fortunes being 
there, signi? e the contrary. But if evil Planets be in the tenth House, they change the con- 
dition of the sick out of one disease into another; but the Fortunes being there, do deliver 
him without the help of Physitians or medicines. Also evil Planets being in the fourth, do 
testi? e, that the medicines do augment his grief; & the Fortunes being there, do mitigate 
and heal him. 
 If thou wouldst know if thou shalt go unto the person and heal him; co? der tnhe place 
then: for if he shall be with Satu rn, Mars, or theD ragons Tail, or ' R '' with theSun , go not 
unto him; but ifJu pite, r Venu or thes Dr agons Hea bd e in the ? rst or in the s eventh, go, for 
it will be good; and if there be the Moon with a good Planet, go, and give him physick; but 
if she shall be with an evil Planet, and especially in the seventh House, then thou shalt not 
go; because thou shalt pr? ot him nothing: and if there be good Planets there, go and look

diligently to him, where or In what members h?e suers; because Aries hath the Head, Tau- 
rus the neck, Cance tr he breast and lungs,Le o the heart and stomackVi, rgo the bell y and 
intestines,Li bra the reins and loyns,Sco rpio the secret membersSag, ittary the thighs, Cap-
ricorn the knees,Aqua ry the legs, and Pisce the fs eet. 
 Questions of the seventh House, 
For theft, look unto the L ord of the seventh: which if he be in? the rst, the theft shall be 
restored again; but if the Lord of the? rst b e in the seventh, it shall be a long time sought
after, and at length shall be found: but if theMoo n be in the ? rst, or with his Lord, it shall 
be found; if theMo on be in the? f th, or with the Lord of the? rst, or * R * in the ? rst, it
may be found; but if theSu n and theM oon be in the? fth, and if the Lord of the eighth be 
with the Lord of the? rst in the ? rst, it shall be found; but if the L ord of the second be in 
the eighth, it shall not be found. And if Saturn, or Mars, or theDr agons Ta i bel in the sec-
ond, it shall not be found, nor be altogether lost. And if the Lord of the second be in the 
? rst, the thing that is lost shall be found; but it shall not be known from whence it came. If 
the Lord of the ? rst be in the second, it maybe found after much labour. And if the Lord 
of the second be in his fall, it will never be found; but if he be exalted, is shall be found 
very well: but the seventh House sheweth the thief. 
 But if you would know what it is that is stollen, behold the L ord of the second; which if 
he beSatu rn, it is lead, iron, a kettle, a trivet, a garment, or some black thing, or leather. If
he be Jupiter, then it is some white thing, as tin, silver, or mixt with white & yellow veins. 
The Sun signi? es gold and precious pearles.Ma rs signi? es things belonging to the ? re. 
Venus signi? es things belonging to women, as gloves, rings, and fair ornaments. The 
Moon, beasts, such as horses, mules &c. perfumes and waMercurrs. y signi? es money,
books, writings, pictures, or garments of divers colours. 
 If you would know how many thieves there were, see the Lord of the sixth; which if he 
be in the second, or with the Lord of the second, there were many thieves; and if they be 
in the third, the brethren or kinsmen of the Querent have committed the theft. 
 If you would know whether the thief do yet remain in the Town: if they be in succedent 
Houses, he is not gone far o? ; but if the be in cadent Houses, he is far remote. 
 If you desire to know towards W hat Countr y the thief? is ed, see in what S igne the 
Lord of the seventh is; for if he be in Aries, he is in the middle of the East parte. If iTanu - 
rus, in the South towards the East. If in Gemin, ii n the West towards the South. If iCan n- 
cer, full North. If in Leo, in the East towards the North. If inVi rgo, in the South towards 
the West. If in Libra, full West. If inSc orpi, in theo North neer the West. If inSa gittary, in
the East nigh the North. If inCa pricorn, full S outh. If inAqua ry, in the West towards the
North. And if in Pisces, In the North towards the West. 
 If you would know whether the thief hath carried all the things stollen away with him, 
see the L ord of the seventh and the eighth; and if the Lord of the seventh be in an Angle, 
he had a desire to carry away the same with him, but could not. If the Lord of the eighth 
8 



--------------------------------------- 9

be in a mean House, or in a cadent House, and the Lord of the second in a strong House, 
he hath carryed the theft wholly with him. And if the Lord of the seventh and the eighth 
be both in cadent Houses, he neither carryed it away, nor hath it. See by the seventh who 
is his companion, and what is his gain. 
 If you would know the descent or nobility of a man or woman, look unto the Lord of 
the seventh; which if yo?u nde him in Angles, and the Lord of the? rst in Succedents or 
cadents, the woman is more noble then the man. But if the Lord of the Ascendent be in 
an Angle, & the L ord of the seventh in a succedent or cadent House, the man is more 
noble then the woman. And after the same manner thou maist judge of two companions, 
or of any other persons whatsoever. And if the L ord of the seventh be in the ninth House, 
he wilt take a wife out of a forreigne Country. 
 If you desire to know Whether an intended marriage shall take? ect, e or not, look to 
the Ascendent and his Lord, and theMoo n, for the Querent; and the seventh House, and 
his Lord, for the woman. And if the Lord of the Ascendent or the Moon be joyned to the 
Lord of the seventh, or be in the seventh, the marriage will? beec eted; or if the Lord of 
the seventh be in the ? rst, or with the L ord of the ? rst, it will easily be brought to pass; 
and the woman is more desirous thereof, then the ma n. 
 If you would know whether thy wife or friend hath any other lover or not, lMaook rs if 
be in the seventh, so that he be not in his own House, for then she hath not any other 
lover. And if Saturn be there, she loveth another; but he lieth not with her. And if the 
Dragons Tail be in the seventh, he lieth with her. And iJupf iter be there, she hardly con- 
taineth herself chaste. If Venus, she is merry, and much given to play and laughter, by rea- 
son whereof, she may be accounted a whore, and is not Mercso. If ury be in the seventh, 
she had a lover, but now hath none. But if Mtheoon be in the seventh, she hath had no 
lover as yet, but will have one, a nd will be common. But iSuf then or the D ragons Head be 
there, she is chaste. And af ter the fa me manner may you judge in the * ninth * concerning 
friends or lovers. 
 If you would know which of them shall live longest, see the Lord of the? rst an d of the 
seventh, which of them shall be in the stronger and better place, or joyned to the strongest 
Planets; and that person who is most free and remote from the Lord of the eighth and his 
participation, to whom the Lord of his House answereth, shall live longest. 
 If you desire to make a societ y or alliance, and would know whether it shall be brought 
to pass or not, or what shall happen thereupon, see if there be good Planets to the seventh 
and the ? rst: and if so, the fellowship will be made, and good will come thereof; and you 
may judge is to continue so ma ny years, months or dayes, as the Lord of the seventh hath 
signi? cation of. 
 If you would know when such society shall be, look what Planet is in the seventh; for if 
he be good, it shall come to pass that same year: or wedlock, * R * if the Question be 
thereof. 
 If you would know whether they will well agree, see? the rst and his Lord, which is the 
signi? er of the Querent; and the seventh House and his Lord, which is the House, of 
 9



--------------------------------------- 10

companions, wives and concubines; which if they be concordant amongst themselves, 
there will be peace and union between them, and they sha?lt;l bpruot if the Planets be in 
discord, there will be strife between them, and the society will no? t pt. ro 
 If you would know which of them shall gain most, see? thrst and e his Lord, and the 
seventh and his Lord, and which of them standeth best; or if they be evil, which of them 
falleth: and he that falleth shall lose, and he that is exalted shall gain. Or otherwise, and 
which is better, see the second and his Lord, and the eighth and his Lord; and in which 
House is the better Planet, or his Lord that shall be found in the better place, or joyned 
with the better Planets he shall be the greater gainer. The second House, and his Lord 
signi? es the dam of the Querent: and the eighth House and his Lord sig? esn thei gain of
his fellow, or his part: and if the be both good, they shall both gain; and if both evil, they 
shall both lose: and if one be good and the other e vil, he whose? sigcator isni good, shall
gain; and he whose is evil, shall lose. 
 And if you would know if two fellows shall love one another, look if the L ords of the 
? rst and the seventh be friends and agreeing, then they will love one to another; but if they 
be enemies and disagree, then they will not. 
 If you desire to know who shall overcome in any cause, matter or controversie, behold 
the Lords of the ? rst and the seventh, which if they be in Angles, neither of them shall 
overcome; and see which of them is joyned with an evil Planet, because he shall overcome; 
and if the Planet be evil from them both, the victor shall kill the conquered; if one of them 
be strong, and the other weak, and the Planet which is in the strong House do not fall, nor 
hath not an evil Planet with him; and if he which is weak be not in his own House, nor in 
his exaltation, nor with a good Planet, he whose Planet is in the strong House, shall over- 
come; likewise he whose sign? cator ii s in a mean House, shall have great fear and doubt in 
his heart, because sometimes he shall hope to conquer, and othe rwhiles fear to be over- 
come. And note, that in a Question concerning war and kingdom, it is said that there is 
more power and e? cacie, or fortitude in the exaltation of a Planet, then in his House; but 
in all other Questions the contrary. 
 If you would be informed concerning any one being that is gone to any? ght, whet her
he shall return safe, see the Lord of the Ascendent; if he be good, that is, with good Plan- 
ets, and a good Planet in the? rst, he w ill return safe; but if the Sun be with the Lord of 
the ? rst, in any part of the Question, let him not go, becauseSu then bur neth him. And if 
the Lord of the seventh be with a good Planet, and the Lord of the? rst w ith a good
Planet likewise, he shall have some impediment in the way; but he will not die. And if an 
evil Planet be with the Lord of the ? rst, and a good Planet in the ? rst, IF he goeth he shall 
su? er great damage, but not death; nevertheless he may be grievously wounded. And if 
Saturn be in the? rst, or with the Lord of the ? rst, let him not go; because some impedi- 
ment will happen unto him by some man that he will meet. And if there be an evil Planet 
with the Lord of the ? rst, or Saturn be in the? rst, or with the Lord of the ? rst he will be 
wounded with wood or with a stone.Ma If rs and the Dragons Tail be in the? rst, or with 
the Lord of the ? rst; or if there be evil Planets in th? e rst, or with the L ord of the? rst he 
10 



--------------------------------------- 11

will su? er wounds or death. See likewise if there be an evil Planet in the eighth, because 
then death is to be feared. And if thSune be with the Lord of the seventh, or in the 
eighth, it sign?i es that it is ill to go. The like judgement is of the seventh and the tenth. 
 And if a Question be proposed concerning the event of War, see the seventh and the 
? rst, and their Lords: for the ? rst House and his Lord signi? es the Querent; and the sev- 
enth House and his Lord the adversar y. So that if there be good Planets in the? rst and 
evil in the seventh; and if the Lord of the? rst a nd seventh be evil, the Querent shall over- 
come: but if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the ? rst, and an evil Planet in the 
? rst, and the Lord of the seventh good, or * R. * in the seventh, the Querent shall be over- 
come, or taken, or slain. And if the Lords of them both be in the ? rst, and there be good 
Planets from the part of the? rst House, unto the end of the House which is the middle of 
the Question, and if evil Planets do possess the other half of the Question, that is to say 
from the seventh unto the end of the twelfth house, the adversar y shall overcome. But if 
both the Lords shall be in the Ascendent, and if they be good from the part o?frst, the 
and evil from the part of the seventh, they shall both su? er great loss; but the Querent 
shall have the better in the end. But if the L ord of the Ascendent be in the seventh, or in 
his Question, it sign?i es fortitude of the adversary: and if the Lord of the seventh be in 
the ? rst, or in his Q uestion, it sig?nies fortitude of the actor. And if the Lord of the 
Ascendent be in the eighth, or with the L ord of the eighth; or the Lord of the eighth in 
the ? rst, or with the L ord of the ? rst, it signi? es the death of the Querent. And if the 
Lord of the seventh be in the second, or with his Lord; or the L ord of the second in the 
seventh, or with the L ord of the seventh, it si?gesni the death of the enemy. 
 If you would know whether War shall continue long or not, if mean or meanly; if the 
Lords of the ? rst and the seventh do agree, the parties shall be? pacied after the War. 
 If thou wouldest depart from the place wherein thou art, and remove thy self to some 
other place; and if thou wouldest know whether it be better for thee to stay or go: or con- 
cerning two businesses, if thou desirest to know which of them is most expedient for thee 
to undertake, consider the L ords of th? erst and the second, for those places to which thou 
wouldest go, the place wherein thou art, and the gain which thou gettest there; and the 
seventh, and the eighth, and their Lords, for the place to which thou wouldest go, and the 
gain which thou mayst get there: and those places chuse, whose Lords are the better, or 
joyned to the better Planets. Or otherwise: behold the Lord of the Ascendent and the 
Moon; which if they be separated from evil Planets, and joyned to good and fortunate 
Planets, it is better for thee to go from the place where thou art, then to stay there, and to 
do what business soever thou hast in thy minde. And if the Lord of the Ascendent and the 
Moon be separated from the Fortunes, and joyned to evil Planets, then it is not good for 
thee to remove thy self, nor to do thy business. Or thus: See thMoone ; and if the Planet 
from which she is separated be better then that to whom she is joyned, do not remove: and 
if the Planet which she is joyned to, be better then that from which she is separated, then 
go.

 Questions of the eighth House. 
Concerning any man or woman, if you would know what kinde of death they shall die, f ee 
if Leo, Scorpi, oo r † R. † Mars, be in the eighth, the party shall die by a beast. AnSatd if -
urn be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth Scin or pi, oCance, orr Pisces, he shall
die in water. And if an e vil Planet be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth; or if
Mars or theDr agons Tay bel there, he shall die by? re , iron, or of a fever. And if there be a
good Planet in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth, he shall die a good death. 
 Questions of the ninth House. 
Concerning long journeys, see if the L ord of the eighth have good Planets with him: and 
if Saturn be in the ninth, and exalted in the tenth, so that he be not in his own House, do 
not go: for thou wilt meet with many obstacles, and War. And if an evil Planet be in the 
ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth, and the Lord of the ninth in his fall, he shall? er su
great damage in the way: for if he goeth by water, lie sha? ll ser shiu pwrack; and if by
Land, he shall have misfortunes, be taken, or die.S aIf turn be in the ninth, or with his 
Lord, go securely. And if a good Planet be in the ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth, the 
way is good and secure. And Maif rs be in the ninth, thou mayest not go: for thou wilt 
meet with mortal enemies in the way. And if the Lord of the ninth be with an evil Planet, 
or the Sun, it signi? es ill: but he shall not be taken. And if the Lord of the ninth have a
good Planet neer him, he shall escape: but if evil, he shall be takeVnenus. If b e i n t he 
ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth, the way will be good, because he shall have comfort 
from women. And if Mercury be in the ninth, and the Lord of the ninth with good Plan- 
ets, the way will be very good: and if he be with evil Planets, it will be evil. And the same
is s aid o f t heM oon, as ofMerc ury. If the Dragons Tay be in thel ninth, he will meet with
theeves, or some evil people. And if the Dra gons Hea dbe in the ninth, the way will be 
good, because he shall be accompanied with Noble-men. And in this maner may you 
judge in the third House concerning short journeys. 
 If you would know when the journey shall be accomplished see the Lord of the ninth, 
and according to his fortitude or debility judge, because according to the place wherein he 
is, is sign?i ed yeers, months, or days: and so you shall judge concerning his stay, about 
what time he will come by turning the yeers of the Lord of the ninth into days; because so 
many days he shall tarry, as the Planet si?gesni in the place where he is. Or otherwise: 
weak Angles sign?ie a speedy journey, mean Angles a mean journey; and the Lord of the 
ninth likewise, according to the place wherein he is found. 
 And this I say concerning his return. 
 If you would know whether he shall return from his journey with an imperfect voyage 
or not, see if theMo on be joyned with the Lord of th?e rst, the third, or the ninth, and the
Planet thereof be in his Fall; because if it be so, he shall return with an imperfect voyage.
12 



--------------------------------------- 13

And if the Moon be in her exaltation, the journey shall speedily? bected. Ae e nd if there be
two strong Planets, and one cadent, the journey shall be made; and if one be strong, and 
another in his fall, he shall retire back. 
 Questions of the tenth House. 
If thou wouldest know whether thou shalt have any honour or? bet fnerom a King, 
Bishop, or Lord, or not, look unto the? rst House, and the ninth, and their Lords: and if 
the Lord of the ? rst be in the ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth, or with any other good 
Planet; or if the Lord of the ninth be in th? e rst, or with the Lord of the ? rst, or with any 
other good P lanet, as Venus, Jupite, or ther Dr agons Hea;d or if any of them be the Lord of 
the ninth, or * R.* of the? rst, he shall receive honour and b?ents fre om them. 
 And if you would know whether he shall have it in his own Country, or in a forraign 
Country, look if the Lord of the ninth be in angles, then it shall be in his own Country 
and if in succedents, it shall be neer; but if in cadent Houses, ver y? . far o 
 Questions of the eleventh House. 
If you would know when it is good to set forth a Ship to Sea, see the Ascendent; which if 
it be stable, the Ship will be ponderous; but if the Lord thereof be with a good Planet, she 
will sustain a great weight. And if the Ascendent be instable, and with a good P lanet, the 
Ship will be swift, and carry a good burden. And meanly, if the Ascendent be mean. And 
after this maner may you judge concerning an Horse, if a Q uestion be thereof. 
 And if any unstable Signe be ascending, and his Lord be in his exaltation, or other wise 
fortunate, and theMoo n behold him with a low ring Aspect, or S extile; let the Ship be 
applied to the water, because she will be very swif t. And if any evil be imposed upon her, 
or that she be like to be drawn into it; then set her out when a stable Signe is ascending, or 
when the Moon is in the third, ? f th, eighth, ninth, or tenth house or mansion. 
 If you would know what winde she shall have, behold the Ascendent and his Lord, 
whether he be with good or evil Planets, and in what place, and accordingly judge. 
 And if you would have a strong winde, spread forth your Sayls at the risiAquang of r y: if 
a small winde, spread your Canvas wheLinbr a is ascending: If a moderate winde, then 
direct your Sayls undeGemir n.i 
 Questions of the twelfth House. 
For Imprisonment, consider the twelfth and the? rs t; and if the Lord of the twelf th be in 
the ? rst, or with the L ord of the ? rst, &c.
